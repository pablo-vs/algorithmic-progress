      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[chemistry]], especially in [[organic chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]], an '''amino group''' is an [[ammonia]]-like [[functional group]] composed of a [[nitrogen]] and two [[hydrogen]] atoms covalently linked.

:-{{nitrogen}}{{hydrogen}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

It is a basic functional group that can give the [[free electron pair]] of the nitrogen atom to the proton of an [[acid]]. In this process, it becomes positively charged.

A compound containing an amino group is called an [[amine]].

'''Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus''' or '''Ealhwine''' (c. [[735]]-[[May 19]], [[804]]) was a [[Monasticism|monk]] from [[York, England]]. He was related to [[Willibrord]], [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[missionary]] to the [[Frisian]]s and the first [[bishop of Utrecht]], whose biography he afterwards wrote.

Alcuin of York had a long career as a teacher and scholar first at the school at York (now known as St Peters School, York, founded AD [[627]]) and lastly as [[Charlemagne]]'s leading advisor on ecclesiastical and educational affairs. From [[796]] until his death he was [[abbot]] of the great [[monastery]] of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]].

He was educated at the cathedral school of York, under the celebrated master [[Ethelbert of York]], with whom he also went to [[Rome]] seeking [[manuscript]]s. When [[Ethelbert]] was appointed [[Archbishop of York]] in [[766]], Alcuin succeeded him in the headship of the episcopal school. He again went to [[Rome]] in [[780]], to fetch the ''[[pallium]]'' for Archbishop [[Eanbald I of York]], and at [[Parma]] met Charlemagne. Charlemagne persuaded him to come to his court and gave him the possession of the great abbeys of [[Ferrieres]] and [[Saint-Loup]] at [[Troyes]].

From [[782]] to [[790]], Alcuin had as pupils the king of the Franks, his kinsmen, the young men sent for their education to the court, and the young [[cleric]]s attached to the palace chapel; he was the life and soul of the Academy of the palace, and we have still, in the ''Dialogue of Pepin (son of Charlemagne) and Alcuin'', a sample of the intellectual exercises in which they indulged. One surviving tool of the drive to reform [[education]] is Charlemagne's circular letter ''De Litteris Colendis'', &quot;On the Study of Letters&quot;, which Alcuin wrote.

In [[790]] Alcuin went back to England, to which he had always been greatly attached, and dwelt there for some time; but Charlemagne invited him back to help in the fight against the [[Adoptionism|Adoptionist]] [[heresy]], which was at that time making great progress in Toledo [[Spain]], the old capital town of the [[Visigoths]] and still a major city for the Christians under Islamic rule in Spain. He is believed to have had contacts with [[Beato de Liébana]], from the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], who fighted against Adoptionism.  At the [[Council of Frankfurt]] in [[794]], Alcuin upheld the [[orthodox]] doctrine, and obtained the condemnation of the ''heresiarch'' [[Felix of Urgel]].  After this victory he again went back to England, but on account of the disturbances which broke out there, and which led to the death of King [[Ethelred]] ([[796]]), he left it forever. Charlemagne had given him the great abbey of St. Martin at Tours, where he was to pass his last years.

He made the abbey school into a model of excellence, and many students flocked to it; he had many manuscripts copied, the [[calligraphy]] of which is of outstanding beauty. He wrote many letters to his friends in England, to [[Arno, bishop of Salzburg]], and above all to Charlemagne. These letters, of which 311 are extant, are filled mainly with pious meditations, but they further form a mine of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time, and are the most reliable authority for the history of [[humanism]] in the [[Carolingian]] age. He also trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety, and it was in the midst of these pursuits that he died.

Alcuin is the most prominent figure of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], in which three main periods have been distinguished: in the first of these, up to the arrival of Alcuin at the court, the [[Italy|Italian]]s occupy the central place; in the second, Alcuin and the Anglo-Saxons are dominant; in the third, which begins in [[804]], the influence of the [[Visigoth]] [[Theodulf]] is preponderant.

Alcuin transmitted to the [[Franks]] the knowledge of Latin culture which had existed in England. We still have a number of his works. His letters have already been mentioned; his [[poetry]] is equally interesting. Besides some graceful epistles in the style of [[Fortunatus]], he wrote some long poems, and notably a whole history in verse of the church at York: ''Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae''. 

We owe to him, too, some manuals used in his educational work; a [[grammar]] and works on [[rhetoric]] and [[dialectics]]. They are written in the form of [[dialogue]]s, and in the two last the interlocutors are Charlemagne and Alcuin. He also wrote several [[theological]] treatises: a ''De fide Trinitatis'', commentaries on the [[Bible]], etc.

[[Alcuin College]], part of the [[University of York]], is named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Angilbert,''' (died [[February 18]], [[814]]), was a [[Franks|Frank]] who served [[Charlemagne]] as a diplomat, abbot, and semi-son-in-law.

He was of noble Frankish parentage, and educated at the palace school under [[Alcuin]].

When Charlemagne sent his young son [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]] to Italy as King of the [[Lombards]] Angilbert went along as ''primicerius palatii,'' a high administrator of the satellite court. As the friend and adviser of Pepin, he assisted for a while in the government of Italy. Angilbert delivered the document on [[Iconoclasm]] from the Frankish Synod of Frankfurt to [[Pope Adrian I]], and was later sent on three important embassies to the pope, in 792, 794 and 796. 

In [[790]] he was named abbot of Saint-Riquier in northern France (often called by its Roman name, Centula), where his brilliant rule gained for him later the renown of a saint.  It was not uncommon for the [[Merovingian]], [[Carolingian]], or later kings to make laymen abbots of monasteries;  the layman would often use the income of the monastery as his own and leave the monks a bare minimum for the necessary expenses of the foundation.  Angilbert, in contrast, spent a great deal rebuilding Saint-Riquier, and when he completed it Charlemagne spent Easter of the year 800 there.

Angilbert's non-sacramental relationship with Bertha was evidently recognized by the court - if she had not been the daughter of the King historians might refer to her as his ''concubine.''  They had at least two sons, one of whom, [[Nithard]], became a notable figure in the mid-9th century.  Control of [[marriage]] and the meanings of legitimacy were hotly contested in the [[Middle Ages]].  Bertha and Angilbert are an example of how resistance to the idea of a sacramental marriage could coincide with holding church offices.

His poems reveal the culture and tastes of a man of the world, enjoying the closest intimacy with the imperial family. He accompanied Charlemagne to Rome in 800 and was one of the witnesses to his will in 814. Angilbert was the [[Homer]] of the emperor's literary circle, and was the probable author of an [[epic poetry|epic]], of which the fragment which has been preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between Charlemagne and Leo III. It is a mosaic from [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Lucan]] and [[Fortunatus]], composed in the manner of Einhard's use of Suetonius, and exhibits a true poetic gift. Of the shorter poems, besides the greeting to Pippin on his return from the campaign against the [[Avars]] (796), an epistle to David (Charlemagne) incidentally reveals a delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperor's palace. The reference to Bertha, however, is distant and respectful, her name occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his salutation.

Angilbert's poems have been published by [[E. Dummler]] in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''. For criticisms of this edition see [[Traube]] in ''Roederer's Schriften für germanische Philologie'' (1888). See also [[A. Molinier]], ''Les Sources de l'histoire de France''.

'''Amines''' are [[organic compound]]s and a type of [[functional group]] that contain [[nitrogen]] as the key atom.  Structurally amines resemble [[ammonia]], wherein one or more [[hydrogen]] atoms are replaced by organic [[substituent]]s such as [[alkyl]]  and [[aryl]] groups.  An important exception to this rule is that compounds of the type RC(O)NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where the C(O) refers to a [[carbonyl group]], are called [[amide]]s rather than amines. Amides and amines have different structures and properties, so the distinction is chemically important.  Somewhat confusing is the fact that  amines wherein an N-H group has been replaced by an N-M group (M = metal) are also called amides.  Thus (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NLi is lithium dimethylamide.

See the [[:Category:Amines]] for a list of types of amine and some real examples of this class of chemical. 

==Introduction==
===Aliphatic Amines===
As displayed in the images below, '''primary amines''' arise when one of three hydrogen atoms in ammonia is replaced by an organic substituent.  '''Secondary amines''' have two organic substituents bound to N together with one H.  In '''tertiary amines''' all three hydrogen atoms are replaced by organic substituents.  Note: the subscripts on the '''R''' groups are simply used to differentiate the organic substituents &lt;!--superscripts are preferred--&gt;.  However, the number subscripts on the H atoms show how many H atoms there are in that group.  
{| border=&quot;0&quot; spacing=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;

| '''Tertiary Amine:'''&lt;br /&gt;[[image:amina3.png|75px|tertiary amine]]
|}

Similarly, an organic compound with  multiple amino groups is called  a  '''diamine''' , '''triamine''', '''tetraamine''' and so forth.

===Aromatic amines===
Aromatic amines have the nitrogen atom connected to an [[aromatic]] ring as in [[aniline]]s.  The aromatic ring strongly decreases the [[base (chemistry)|basicity]] of the amine, depending on its substituents. Interestingly, the presence of an amine group strongly increases the reactivity of the aromatic ring, due to an electron-donating affect. One [[organic reaction]] involving aromatic amines is the [[Goldberg reaction]].

==Naming conventions==
* the prefix &quot;N-&quot; shows substitution on the nitrogen atom (in the case of secondary, tertiary and quaternary amines)
* as prefix: &quot;amino-&quot;
* as suffix: &quot;-amine&quot;
* remember that chemical compounds are not proper nouns, so lower case is indicated throughout.
Systematic names for some common amines:
{| border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; spacing=&quot;5&quot;
|- valign=&quot;top&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
| Lower amines are named with the suffix ''-amine''.&lt;br /&gt;
[[image:methylamine.png|100px]]&lt;br /&gt;
'''methylamine'''
| Higher amines have the prefix ''amino'' as a functional group.&lt;br /&gt;
[[image:2-amino-pentane.png|150px]]&lt;br /&gt;
'''2-aminopentane'''&lt;br/&gt;(or sometimes: ''pent-2-yl-amine'' or ''pentane-2-amine'')
|}

*Primary amines: 2-aminoethanol or [[ethanolamine]]
*Secondary amines:  [[dimethylamine]]
*Tertiary amines: [[trimethylamine]]

==Physical properties==
===General properties===
* 1. [[Hydrogen bonding]] significantly influences the properties of primary and secondary amines as well as the protonated derivatives of all amines. Thus the [[boiling point]] of amines is higher than those for the corresponding [[phosphine]]s, but generally lower than the corresponding [[alcohol]]s.  Alcohols, or alkanols, resemble amines but feature an -OH group in place of NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Since oxygen is more [[electronegative]] than nitrogen, RO-''H''  is typically more acidic than the related R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-''H'' compound.
* 2. Methyl, dimethyl, trimethyl, and ethyl amines are gases under standard conditions.  Most common alkyl amines are liquids;  high [[molecular weight]] amines are, of course, solids.
* 3. Gaseous amines possess a characteristic ammonia smell, liquid amines have a distinctive &quot;fishy&quot; smell.
* 4. Most aliphatic amines display some solubility in water, reflecting their ability to form hydrogen bonds.  Solubility decreases with the increase in the number of carbon atoms, especially when the carbon atom number is greater than 6.
* 5. Aliphatic amines display significant solubility in organic [[solvent]]s, especially polar organic solvents.  Primary amines react with [[ketone]]s such as [[acetone]], and most amines are incompatible with [[chloroform]] and [[carbon tetrachloride]].
* 6. The aromatic amines have their lone pair electrons [[conjugated system|conjugated]] into the benzene ring, thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished.  Otherwise they display the following properties:
** Their boiling points are usually still high &lt;!--&quot;higher&quot;: than what?--&gt;due to their larger size.
** Diminished solubility in water, although they retain their solubitity in suitable organic solvents only.
** They are toxic &lt;!-- which one has: b.p.184 C?--&gt; and are easily absorbed through the skin: thus hazardous.
[[Image:Inversion_of_Amine.PNG|200px|right|amine inversion]]

=== Chirality===
Tertiary amines of the type NHRR' and NRR'R&quot; are [[optical isomer|chiral]]: the nitrogen atom bears four distinct substituents counting the lone pair.  The energy barrier for the [[Walden inversion|inversion]] of the stereocenter is relatively low, e.g. ~7 kcal/mol for a trialkylamine. The interconversion of the stereoisomers has been compared to the inversion of an open umbrella in to a strong wind.  Because of this low barrier, amines such as NHRR' cannot be resolved optically and NRR'R&quot; can only be resolved when the R, R', and R&quot; groups are constrained in cyclic structures.

===Properties as bases===
Like ammonia, amines act as [[base (chemistry)|bases]] and are reasonably strong (see table for examples of [[conjugate acid]] K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values). The basicity of amines depends on:
#The availability of lone pair on N.
#The electronic properties of the substituents (alkyl groups enhance the basicity, aryl groups diminish it).
#The degree of solvation of the protonated amine.

The nitrogen atom features a [[lone electron pair]] that can bind H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to form an [[ammonium ion]] R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  The lone electron pair is represented in this article by a two dots above or next to the N. The water [[solubility]] of simple amines is largely due to [[hydrogen bonding]] between protons on the water molecules and these lone electron pairs.

&lt;!-- the following statement is incorrect or excessively vague: &quot;Protonated ammonia is heavily solvated, making the cation most stable.&quot;--&gt;

== Synthesis ==
The following laboratory methods exist for the preparation of amines:
* via the [[Gabriel synthesis]]:
[[Image:Gabriel Synthesis Scheme.png|500px|center|The Gabriel synthesis]]
* via [[azide]]s by the [[Staudinger reduction]]. 
* [[Allyl]]ic amines can be prepared from [[imine]]s in the [[Aza-Baylis-Hillman reaction]].
* via [[Hofmann rearrangement|Hoffmann degradation]] of amides.This reaction is valid for preparation of primary amines only. Gives good yields of primary amines uncontaminated with other amines.
:[[Image:Hofmann Rearrangement Scheme.png|center|400px|The Hofmann rearrangment]]
* Hoffmann elimination of quaternary ammonium salts
:::R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R'  +  OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;   &amp;rarr;  R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;C=CHR'  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;O
* [[Quaternary ammonium salt]]s upon treatment with strong base undergo the so-called [[Hofmann Elimination]]
* Reduction of nitriles and amides
[[Image:Nitrile.gif|center|Nitriles]]
* [[Nitrile]]s are reduced to amines using hydrogen in the presence a nickel catalyst, although acidic or alkaline conditions should be avoided to avoid hydrolysis of -CN group.
* LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is more commonly employed for the reduction of nitriles on the laboratory scale.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Reduction-of-amide.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
* Similarly, LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; reduces amides to amines.
* Nucleophilic substitution of haloalkanes. Primary amines can also be synthesized by alkylaton of ammonia.[[halogenoalkane|Haloalkane]]s react with amines to give a corresponding alkyl-substituted amine, with the release of a halogen acid.  Such reactions, which are most useful for alkyl iodides and bromides, are rarely employed because the degree of alkylation is difficult to control. If the reacting amine is tertiary, a [[quaternary ammonium cation]] results. Many [[quaternary ammonium salt]]s can be prepared by this route with diverse R groups and many halide and pseudohalide anions.

== Reactions ==
Amines react in a variety of ways:
* By [[nucleophilic acyl substitution]]. [[Acyl chloride]]s and [[acid anhydride]]s react with primary and secondary amines in cold to form [[amide]]s. Tertiary amines cannot be acylated due to the absence of a replaceable hydrogen atom. With the much less active [[benzoyl chloride]], [[acylation]] can still be performed by the use of excess aqeous alkali to facilitate the reaction. 

[[Image:Amide_formation_from_amine.gif|center|Amide formation]]

:Because amines are basic, they neutralize [[carboxylic acid]]s to form the corresponding ammonium carboxylate salts. Upon heating to 200&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C, the primary and secondary amine salts dehydrate to form the corresponding [[amide]]s.

[[Image:Amine_plus_Carboxylic_Acid.PNG|center|Amine reaction with carboxylic acids]]

* By ammonium salt formation. Amines R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N react with strong acids such as [[hydroiodic acid]], [[hydrobromic acid]] and [[hydrochloric acid]] in neutralization reactions forming [[ammonium salt]]s R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

* By diazonium salt formation. [[Nitrous acid]] with formula HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is unstable, therefore usually a mixture of NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and dilute [[hydrochloric acid]] or [[sulfuric acid]] is used to produce nitrous acid indirectly. Primary aliphatic amines with nitrous acid give very unstable diazonium salts which spontaneously decompose by losing N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form carbonium ion. The carbonium ion goes on to produce a mixture of alkenes, alkanols or alkyl halides, with alkanols as the major product. This reaction is of lttle synthetic importance because the diazonium salt formed is too unstable, even at cold conditions.
: NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl &amp;rarr; HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + NaCl

[[Image:Nitrous_acid_with_n-amine.gif|center|Nitrous acid reaction]]

:Primary aromatic amines, such as [[aniline]] (phenylamine) forms a more stable [[diazonium]] ion at 0&amp;ndash;5&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C. Above 5&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C, it will decompose to give [[phenol]] and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Diazonium salt can be isolated in the crystalline form but are usually used in solution and immediately after preparation, due to rapid decomposition on standing even in cold. Solid salt explosive on shock or on mild warming.

[[Image:Aromatic_diazonium_salt.gif|center|Aromatic diazonium salts]]

* By [[Alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution|imine formation]]. Primary amines react with [[ketone]]s and [[aldehyde]]s to form [[imine]]s. In the case of [[formaldehyde]] (R' = H), these products are typically cyclic [[trimer]]s.

: RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + R'&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=O &amp;rarr; R'&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=NR + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

:Secondary amines react with ketones and aldehydes to form [[enamine]]s
: R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH + R'(R&quot;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;)C=O &amp;rarr; R&quot;CH=C(NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)R' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
* By [[organic oxidation|oxidation]] to [[nitroso]] compounds, for instance [[Peroxymonosulfuric acid]].
== Use of amines==
=== dyes ===
Primary aromatic amines are used as a starting material for the manufacture of [[azo dye]]s. It reacts with nitric(III) acid to form diazonium salt which can undergo coupling reaction to form azo compound.As azo-compounds are highly coloured, they are widely used in dyeing industries, such as:
* [[Methyl orange]]
* [[Direct brown 138]]
* [[Sunset yellow]] FCF
* [[Ponceau]]

===drugs===
* [[Chlorpheniramine]] is an antihistamine the helps to relief allergic disorders due to cold, hay fever, itchy skin, insect bites and stings.
* [[Chlorpromazine]] is a tranquilliser that sedates without inducing sleep. It is used to relieve anxiety, excitement, restlessness or even mental disorder.
* [[Acetaminophen]]  is also known as paracetamol or p-acetaminophenol, an analgesic that relieves pains such as headaches. It is believed to be less corrosive to the stomach and is an alternative to aspirin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Absolute zero''' is a fundamental lower bound on the [[temperature]] of any macroscopic [[system]]. It is  a temperature of [[kelvin|0 K]], [[Celsius|&amp;minus;273.15&amp;deg;C]], &lt;!-- Exactly! Celsius is defined as  kelvin minus 273.15 these days. --&gt; or [[Fahrenheit|&amp;minus;459.67&amp;deg;F]].  It is unachievable in practice but it exists as a limit for real [[physical phenomenon|physical phenomena]], and it was inferred by [[extrapolation]] from [[kinetic theory]], and from other considerations in [[theoretical physics]].  One would like to define it as the temperature at which all [[motion]] ceases, but even at absolute zero some motion remains due to the requirements of [[quantum mechanics]]. Alternate definitions are that absolute zero is the temperature at which no further [[energy]] can be extracted from a [[physical body]], or the temperature at which the [[entropy|entropies]] of perfect [[crystal]]s vanish, or the temperature at which the entropy change of an [[adiabatic]] [[process]] vanishes.

A state of '''absolute zero''' was first proposed by [[Guillaume Amontons]] in [[1702]] who was investigating the relationship between [[pressure]] and temperature in [[gas]]es. He lacked accurate and precise [[thermometers]] so his results were only semi-[[quantitative]], but he established that the pressure of a gas increases by roughly one-third between &quot;cold&quot; temperatures and the [[boiling point]] of [[water]]. His work led him to speculate that a sufficient reduction in temperature would lead to the disappearance of pressure. The problem is that all [[ideal gas|real gases]] [[liquid|liquefy]] during the approach to absolute zero.

In [[1848]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]] proposed an [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute thermodynamic temperature]] scale in which equal reduction in measured temperature gave rise to equal reduction in the heat of a [[body]]. This freed the concept from the constraints of the [[gas laws]] and established absolute zero as the temperature at which no further heat could be removed from a body. Absolute zero has never been reached, and it appears it never will be. It may be [[asymptote|asymptotically]] approached like the [[speed of light]], but never attained.

==Kinetic theory and motion==
According to [[kinetic theory]], there should be no movement of individual [[molecule]]s at absolute zero, so any material at this temperature would be solid. In a [[monatomic]] gas, most of the energy is in the form of translational motion, and the temperature can be measured in terms of the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution|distribution of this motion]], with slower speeds corresponding to lower temperatures, perhaps even down to absolute zero. But this is contrary to [[experiment]]al evidence, and it is predicted that [[helium]] will never [[solid|solidify]], no matter how much it is cooled or compressed.

Because of quantum-mechanical effects, the speed at absolute zero is larger than zero and depends, along with the energy, on the volume within which a particle is confined. At absolute zero, the [[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s in a system are all in their [[ground state]], the state of lowest possible energy, and a system has the least amount of kinetic energy allowed by the [[laws of physics]]. But the lowest possible [[zero-point energy]] for a ''confined'' [[particle in a box]] is not zero. Rather than being fixed and non-moving, the equation for the energy levels shows that no matter how low the temperature gets, even when the [[quantum number]] takes its minimum value of one, a particle still has some translational [[kinetic energy]] and motion. This is a reflection of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] [[uncertainty principle]], which states that the [[dimension|position]] and the [[momentum]] of a particle cannot both be known precisely at any given time.

Similarly, using the [[harmonic oscillator|harmonic]] approximation for the vibrations of a diatomic molecule, the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] yields a positive zero-point energy even when the vibrational [[quantum number]] takes its minimum value of zero. For polyatomic molecules, and for  bodies such as [[crystal]]s, whose [[normal mode]] motions can not be assigned to individual atoms or [[chemical bond]]s, the lowest-energy state is that of the system as a whole.

[[Classical mechanics|Classically]], the absolute temperature ''T'' of a system of molecules at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] assigns an average of 1/2&amp;nbsp;''kT'' to each [[quadratic function|quadratic]] [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and/or [[potential energy]] term in each mechanical [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]], where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]]. (See [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)#Equipartition theorem|equipartition of energy]] and the role of the [[Boltzmann distribution]] in relating temperature to energy.) But quantum mechanics shows that this is obeyed only for temperatures such that ''kT''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''hν'', where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ν is a characteristic [[frequency]]. As ''T'' decreases, the assumption that energy is continuously variable fails whenever ''hν'' exceeds ''kT''. For [[normal mode|vibrational modes]] in crystals, this happens at [[room temperature]], which explains the deviation of the calculated [[specific heat capacity|specific heats]] of atomic crystals from the [[experiment]]al [[Dulong-Petit law]] value of 3''R''&amp;nbsp;/mole, a fact which puzzled late [[19th century]] [[physics|physicists]] and [[physical chemistry|physical chemists]]. (Rushbrooke, p. 33)

==Cryogenics==
It can be shown from the laws of [[thermodynamics]] that absolute zero can never be achieved, though it is possible to reach temperatures arbitrarily close to it through the use of [[cryocoolers]]. This is the same principle that ensures no [[machine]] can be 100% efficient.

At very low temperatures in the vicinity of absolute zero, matter exhibits many unusual properties including [[superconductor|superconductivity]], [[superfluid|superfluidity]], and [[Bose-Einstein condensate|Bose-Einstein condensation]]. In order to study such [[phenomenon|phenomena]], [[scientist]]s have worked to obtain ever lower temperatures.

*As of September 2003, the lowest temperature Bose-Einstein condensate achieved was 450&amp;#160;[[1 E-12 K|pK]], or 4.5&amp;#160;&amp;#215;&amp;#160;10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#160;K. This was performed by [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] and colleagues at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].{{rf|1|Leanhardt}}

*As of February 2003, the [[Boomerang Nebula]], with a temperature of 1.15&amp;#160;K, is the coldest place known outside a laboratory. The [[nebula]] is [[1 E19 m|5000 light-years]] from [[Earth]] and is in the constellation [[Centaurus]].{{rf|2|Cauchi}}

*As of November 2002, the coldest temperature produced was 100 pK during an experiment on [[nuclear magnetic ordering]] in the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]'s Low Temperature Lab.{{rf|3|Knuuttila}}

==Thermodynamics near absolute zero==
At 0&amp;nbsp;K, (nearly) all molecular motion ceases and Δ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for any [[adiabatic process]]. Pure substances can (ideally) form perfect [[crystal]]s as ''T''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0. [[Max Planck|Planck's]] strong form of the [[third law of thermodynamics]] states that the [[entropy]] of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero. However, if the lowest energy state is [[degenerate energy level|degenerate]] (more than one [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]]), this cannot be true. The original [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]] ''heat theorem'' makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy ''change'' for any isothermal process approaches zero as ''T''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{T \to 0} \Delta S = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

which implies that the entropy of a perfect crystal simply approaches a constant value.

&lt;font color=maroon&gt;''The Nernst postulate identifies the isotherm T&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 as coincident with the adiabat S&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct. As no two adiabats intersect, no other adiabat can intersect the T&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 isotherm. Consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature.''&lt;/font&gt; (≈&amp;nbsp;Callen, pp. 189-190)

An even stronger assertion is that &lt;font color=maroon&gt;''It is impossible by any procedure to reduce the temperature of a system to zero in a finite number of operations.''&lt;/font&gt; (≈&amp;nbsp;Guggenheim, p. 157)

A perfect crystal is one in which the internal [[lattice (group)|lattice]] structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational [[symmetry]] along three (not usually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]) [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]]. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For [[chemical substance|substances]] which have two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as [[diamond]] and [[graphite]] for [[carbon]], there is a kind of &quot;chemical degeneracy&quot;. The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 even though each is perfectly ordered.

Perfect crystals never occur in practice; imperfections, and even entire amorphous materials, simply get &quot;frozen in&quot; at low temperatures, so transitions to more stable states do not occur.

Using the [[Peter Debye|Debye]] model, the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to ''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/sup&gt;, while the [[enthalpy]] and [[chemical potential]] are proportional to ''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/sup&gt;. (Guggenheim, p. 111) These quantities drop toward their ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 limiting values and approach with ''zero'' slopes. For the specific heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as borne out by experiments to below 10&amp;nbsp;K. Even the less detailed [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] model shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish as absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of [[thermal expansion]]. [[Maxwell relations|Maxwell's relations]] show that various other quantities also vanish. These [[phenomenon|phenomena]] were unanticipated. 

Since the relation between changes in the [[Gibbs free energy]], the enthalpy and the entropy is

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S \,&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that as ''T'' decreases, Δ''G'' and Δ''H'' approach each other (so long as  Δ''S'' is bounded). [[Experiment]]ally, it is found that most [[chemical reaction]]s are [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] and release heat ''in the direction'' they are found to be going, toward [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilbirum]]. That is, even at [[room temperature]] ''T'' is low enough so that the fact that (Δ''G'')&lt;sub&gt;''T,P''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0 (usually) implies that Δ''H''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0. (In the opposite direction, each such reaction would of course absorb heat.)

More than that, the ''slopes'' of the temperature derivatives of Δ''G'' and Δ''H'' converge and ''are equal to zero'' at ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, which ensures that Δ''G'' and Δ''H'' are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures, justifying the approximate [[empiricism|empirical]] [[Principle of Thomsen and Berthelot]], which says that &lt;font color=maroon&gt;''the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one which evolves the greatest amount of heat''&lt;/font&gt;, i.e., an actual process is the ''most exothermic one''. (Callen, pp. 186-187)

==Absolute temperature scales==
As mentioned, absolute or [[thermodynamic temperature]] is conventionally measured in [[Kelvin]]s (Celsius-size degrees), and increasingly rarely in the [[Rankine]] scale (Fahrenheit-size degrees). Absolute temperature is uniquely determined up to a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the &quot;degree&quot;, so the ''ratios'' of two absolute temperatures, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition comes from the classical [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]] over energies, or from the quantum analogs: [[Fermi-Dirac statistics]] (particles of half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) and [[Bose-Einstein statistics]] (particles of integer spin), all of which give the relative numbers of particles as (decreasing) [[exponential function]]s of energy over ''kT''. On a [[macroscopic]] level, a definition can be given in terms of the efficiencies of &quot;reversible&quot; [[heat engine]]s operating between hotter and colder thermal reservoirs.

==Negative temperatures==

Certain semi-isolated systems can achieve negative temperatures; however, they are not actually colder than absolute zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article covers adiabatic processes in [[thermodynamics]]. For adiabatic processes in [[quantum mechanics]], see [[adiabatic process (quantum mechanics)]].  For atmospheric adiabatic processes, see [[adiabatic lapse rate]].''

In [[thermodynamics]], an '''adiabatic process''' is a process in which no [[heat]] is transferred to or from working [[fluid]]. The term &quot;adiabatic&quot; literally means an absence of heat transfer; for example, an '''adiabatic boundary''' is a boundary that is impermeable to heat transfer and the system is said to be adiabatically (or thermally) insulated. An insulated wall approximates an adiabatic boundary.
Another example is the [[adiabatic flame temperature]], which is the temperature that would be achieved by a [[fire|flame]] in the absence of heat loss to the surroundings.
An adiabatic process which is also [[reversible process|reversible]] is called an [[isentropic process]]. 

The opposite extreme, in which the maximum heat transfer with its surroundings occurs, causing the temperature to remain constant, is known as an [[isothermal process]]. Since temperature is thermodynamically [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] to entropy, the isothermal process is conjugate to the adiabatic process for reversible transformations.

A transformation of a thermodynamic system can be considered adiabatic when it is quick enough so that no significant [[heat transfer]] happens between the system and the outside. At the opposite, a transformation of a thermodynamic system can be considered [[isothermal process|isothermal]] if it is slow enough so that the system's temperature can be maintained by [[heat]] exchange with the outside. 

== Adiabatic heating and cooling ==
Adiabatic heating and cooling are processes that commonly occur due to a change in the [[pressure]] of a [[gas]]. Adiabatic heating occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased. An example of this is what goes on in a [[bicycle pump]]. After using a bicycle pump to inflate a pneumatic tyre or [[soccer ball]] the barrel of the pump is found to have heated up as a result of adiabatic heating. A common motorized [[air compressor]], operating at pressures up to 150 [[Pound-force per square inch|psi]], can reach outlet temperatures of several hundred degrees Fahrenheit.  Adiabatic cooling occurs when the pressure of a gas is decreased, such as when it expands into a larger volume.  An example of this is when the air is released from a pneumatic tire; the outlet air will be noticably cooler than the tire, and after all the air has escaped the valve stem will be cold to the touch.  [[Diesel engines]] rely on adiabatic heating during their compression stroke to reach the high temperatures needed to ignite the fuel.  Such temperature changes can be quantified using the [[ideal gas law]].

Adiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid. One technique used to reach very low temperatures (thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero) is [[adiabatic demagnetization|adiabatic demagnetisation]], where the change in [[magnetic field]] on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling.

==Ideal gas==
[[Image:Adiabatic.png|thumb|341px|For a simple substance, during an adiabatic process in which the volume increases, the [[internal energy]] of the working substance must necessarily decrease]]
The mathematical equation for an [[ideal gas|ideal]] fluid undergoing an adiabatic process is
: &lt;math&gt; P V^{\gamma} = \operatorname{constant} \qquad &lt;/math&gt;
where ''P'' is pressure, ''V'' is volume, and
: &lt;math&gt; \gamma = {C_{P} \over C_{V}} = \frac{\alpha + 1}{\alpha}, &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; C_{P} &lt;/math&gt; being the [[molar specific heat]] for constant pressure and
&lt;math&gt; C_{V} &lt;/math&gt; being the molar specific heat for constant volume.
&lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; comes from the number of degrees of freedom (3/2 for monatomic gas, 5/2 for diatomic gas, 3 for complex molecules).
For a monatomic ideal gas, &lt;math&gt; \gamma = 5/3 &lt;/math&gt;, and for a diatomic gas (such as [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]], the main components of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]) &lt;math&gt; \gamma = 7/5 &lt;/math&gt;. Note that the above formula is  only applicable to classical ideal gases and not Bose-Einstein or Fermi gases.

For adiabatic processes, it is also true that

: &lt;math&gt; VT^\alpha = \operatorname{constant} &lt;/math&gt;

''T'' is temperature in kelvins.

===Derivation of formula===
The definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero, &lt;math&gt;\delta Q=0 &lt;/math&gt;. Then, according to the [[first law of thermodynamics]],

:&lt;math&gt; d U + \delta W = \delta Q = 0 \qquad \qquad \qquad (1) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''dU'' is the change in the internal energy of the system and ''&amp;delta;W'' is work done
''by'' the system.  Any work (''&amp;delta;W'') done must be done at the expense of internal energy ''U'', since no heat ''&amp;delta;Q'' is being supplied from the surroundings. Pressure-volume work ''&amp;delta;W'' done ''by'' the system is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = P dV. \qquad \qquad \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

However, ''P'' does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but
instead changes along with ''V''.

It is desired to know how the values of &lt;math&gt; d P &lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt; d V &lt;/math&gt; relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds.

:&lt;math&gt; C_{V} = \alpha R\,&lt;/math&gt; 

where ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]].

Given &lt;math&gt; d P &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; d V &lt;/math&gt; then
&lt;math&gt; \delta W = P d V &lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt; d E = \alpha n R d T
                  = \alpha d (P V)
                  = \alpha (P d V + V d P). \qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

Now substitute equations (2) and (3) into equation (1) to obtain

: &lt;math&gt; -P d V = \alpha P d V + \alpha V d P \,&lt;/math&gt;

simplify,

: &lt;math&gt; - (\alpha + 1) P d V = \alpha V d P \,&lt;/math&gt;

divide both sides by ''PV'',

: &lt;math&gt; -(\alpha + 1) {d V \over V} = \alpha {d P \over P}. &lt;/math&gt;

From the differential calculus it is then known that

: &lt;math&gt; -(\alpha + 1) d (\ln V) = \alpha d (\ln P)  \,&lt;/math&gt;

which can be expressed as

: &lt;math&gt; {\ln P - \ln P_0 \over \ln V - \ln V_0 } = -{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha} &lt;/math&gt;

for certain constants &lt;math&gt; P_0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; V_0 &lt;/math&gt; of the
initial state.  Then

: &lt;math&gt; {\ln (P/P_0) \over \ln (V/V_0)} = -{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 
\ln \left( {P \over P_0} \right) 
=\ln \left( {V \over V_0} \right)^{-{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Exponentiate both sides,

: &lt;math&gt; \left( {P \over P_0} \right) 
=
\left( {V \over V_0} \right)^{-{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}},  &lt;/math&gt;

eliminate the negative sign,

: &lt;math&gt; \left( {P \over P_0} \right)
=
\left( {V_0 \over V} \right)^{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}.  &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore

: &lt;math&gt; \left( {P \over P_0} \right) \left( {V \over V_0} \right)^{\alpha+1 \over \alpha} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt; P V^{\alpha+1 \over \alpha} = P_0 V_0^{\alpha+1 \over \alpha} = P V^\gamma = \operatorname{constant}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Graphing adiabats==
Properties of adiabats on a P-V diagram are:
#Every adiabat asymptotically approaches both the V axis and the P axis (just like isotherms).
#Each adiabat intersects each isotherm exactly once.
#An adiabat looks similar to an isotherm, except that during an expansion, an adiabat loses more pressure than an isotherm, so it has a steeper inclination (more vertical).
#If isotherms are concave towards the &quot;north-east&quot; direction (45 &amp;deg;), then adiabats are concave towards the &quot;east north-east&quot; (31 &amp;deg;).
#If adiabats and isotherms are graphed severally at regular changes of entropy and temperature, respectively (like altitude on a contour map), then as the eye moves outwards away from the axes (towards the north-east), it sees the density of isotherms stay constant, but it sees the density of adiabats drop.  The exception is very near absolute zero, where the density of adiabats drops sharply and they become rare (see [[Nernst's theorem]]).

The following diagram is a P-V diagram with a superposition of adiabats and isotherms:

[[Image:Entropyandtemp.PNG]]

The isotherms are the red curves and the adiabats are the black curves.  The adiabats are isentropic.  Volume is the [[abscissa]] (x-axis) and pressure is the [[ordinate]] (y-axis).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Amide.png|right|Amide functional group]]In [[chemistry]], an '''''amide''''' is either the [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[functional group]] characterized by a [[carbonyl]] group linked to a [[nitrogen]] atom or a compound that contains this functional group, or a particular [[inorganic]] [[anion]]. In organic chemistry, an amide is essentially an [[amine]] where one of the nitrogen [[substituent|substituents]] is a carbonyl group, represented generally by the formula: R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;([[carbon|C]][[oxygen|O]])[[nitrogen|N]]R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; where either or both of R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; may be [[hydrogen]]. Specifically, an amide can also be regarded as a derivative of a [[carboxylic acid]] in which the hydroxyl group has been replaced by an [[amine]] or [[ammonia]].

Compounds in which a [[hydrogen]] atom on nitrogen from [[ammonia]] or an [[amine]] is replaced by a [[metal]] [[cation]] are also known as amides or '''azanides'''.

The inorganic amide anion is an extremely strong base, due to the extreme weakness of ammonia as a [[Brønsted acid]].

==Amide synthesis==
[[Image:Amide react.png|right|Amide bond formation]]
*Amides are commonly formed from the reaction of a [[carboxylic acid]]s with an [[amine]].This is the reaction that forms [[peptide bond]]s between [[amino acid]]s. These amides can participate in [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonding]] as hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, but do not [[ion|ionize]] in aqueous solution, whereas their parent acids and amines are almost completely ionized in solution at neutral pH. Amide formation plays a role in the synthesis of some [[condensation polymer]]s, such as [[nylon]] and [[Kevlar]]. 
* Cyclic amides are synthesized in the [[Beckmann rearrangement]] from oximes.
* Other amide forming reactions are the [[Passerini reaction]] and the [[Ugi reaction]]
== Amide reactions ==
* Amide breakdown is possible via [[amide hydrolysis]].
* In the [[Vilsmeier-Haack reaction]] an amide is converted into an imine.
== Amide Properties ==
An amide linkage is kinetically stable to [[hydrolysis]]. However, it can be hydrolysed in boiling alkali, as well as in strong acidic conditions. Unlike the hydrolysis of esters, the kinetics of amide hydrolysis is third order: first order with respect to the amide and second order with respect to hydroxide. Amide linkages in a [[biochemistry| biochemical]] context are called [[peptide link|peptide linkages]]. Amide linkages constitute a defining molecular feature of [[protein|proteins]], the [[secondary structure]] of which is due in part to the hydrogen bonding abilities of amides.

==Derivatives==
[[Sulfonamide]]s are analogs of amides in which the atom double bonded to oxygen is [[sulfur]] rather than carbon.

==Naming Convertions ==
*Example: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is named [[acetamide]] or [[ethanamide]]
*Other examples: propan-1-amide, N,N-dimethylpropanamide, [[acrylamide]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[religion]], the term '''&quot;Animism&quot;''' is used in a number of ways.  
*Animism (from ''animus'', or ''anima'', [[mind]] or soul), originally means the doctrine of [[spiritual beings]].  
*It is often extended to include the belief that personalized, [[supernatural]] beings (or souls) endowed with [[reason]], [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and [[volition]] inhabit ordinary objects as well as animate beings, and govern their existence ([[pantheism]] or [[animatism]]). More simply, the belief is that &quot;[[everything]] is [[alive]]&quot;, &quot;everything is [[conscious]]&quot; or &quot;everything has a soul&quot;.  
*It has been further extended to mean a belief that the world is a community of living [[persons]], only some of whom are human.  It also refers to the culture or philosophy which these types of Animists live by, that is, to attempt to relate respectfully with the persons (human, rock, plant, animal, bird, ancestral, etc.) who are also members of the wider community of life.  
'''&quot;Animism&quot;''' can refer to the [[religion]] or [[beliefs]] or [[philosophy]] of the above interpretations.  It can also refer to the [[culture]] and [[practice]]s related to Animism.

&quot;Animism&quot; was the term used by [[anthropology | anthropologist]], Sir [[E. B. Tylor]], as a proposed theory of [[religion]], in his [[1871]] book, ''[[Primitive Culture]]''.   He used it to mean a 'belief in spirits' (i.e. mystical, supernatural, non-empirical or imagined entities).  Tylor's use of the term  has since been widely criticized (see details below).  Today the term is used with more respect.

Today Animists live in significant numbers in countries such as [[Zambia]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Gabon]], the [[Republic of Guinea Bissau]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]], [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Philippines]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], [[Thailand]], and the [[United States of America]].

Modern [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]], especially Eco-Pagans, sometimes describe themselves as animists, meaning that they respect the diverse community of living beings with whom humans share the world/cosmos. Some, however, use the term to refer to the idea that the [[Mother goddess]] and [[Horned god]] consist of everything that exists. This [[Pantheism]] in which [[God]] is equated with [[existence]] is different from animism because it imputes value to individual living beings and/or objects because they might reveal a larger reality or divinity behind everything. Animists respect beings for their own sake - whether because they have or are souls (as in the original definition of the word) or because they are persons (the new definition). 

==Overview==
In some animistic worldviews found in [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures, the human being is often regarded as on a roughly equal footing with animals, plants, and natural forces. Therefore, it is morally imperative to treat these agents with respect. In this worldview, humans are considered a denizen, or part, of nature, rather than superior to or separate from it. In such societies, ritual is considered essential for survival as it wins the favor of the spirits of one's source of food, shelter, and fertility and wards off malevolent spirits. In more elaborate animistic religions, such as [[Shinto]], there is a greater sense of a special character to humans that sets them apart from the general run of animals and objects, while retaining the necessity of ritual to ensure good luck, favorable harvests, and so on.

Most animistic belief systems hold that the spirit survives physical death. In some systems, the spirit is believed to pass to an easier world of abundant game or ever-ripe crops, while in other systems (''e.g.'', the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] religion), the spirit remains on earth as a [[ghost]], often malignant. Still other systems combine these two beliefs, holding that the soul must journey to the spirit world without becoming lost and thus wandering as a ghost. [[Funeral]], [[mourning]] rituals, and [[ancestor worship]] performed by those surviving the deceased are often considered necessary for the successful completion of this journey.

Rituals in animistic cultures are often performed by [[shaman|shamans]] or [[priest|priests]], who are usually seen as possessing spiritual powers greater than or external to the normal human experience.

The practice of [[shrunken head|head shrinking]] as found among [[headhunter]]s derives from an animistic belief that one's war enemies, if the spirit is not trapped within the head, can escape the body. After the spirit [[transmigrates]] to another body, they take the form of a [[predator]]y animal and exact revenge.

Animism is the belief that objects and ideas including animals, tools, and natural phenomena have or are expressions of living [[spirit]]s.

==Origins==
Early ideas on the subject of the soul, and at the same time the origin of them, can be illustrated by analysis of the terms applied to them. Readers of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] know the idea that the dead have no shadows. This was no invention of the poet's but a piece of traditional lore.

Among the [[Basutoland|Basutus]] it is held that a man walking by the brink of a river may lose his life if his shadow falls on the water, for a [[crocodile]] may seize it and draw him in. 

In [[Tasmania]], [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] and classical Europe is found the conception that the soul &amp;#8212; &amp;#963;&amp;#954;&amp;#953;&amp;#8049;, ''umbra'' &amp;#8212; is identical with the shadow of a person. More familiar to Europeans is the connection between the soul and the breath. This identification is found both in [[Indo-European languages | Indo-European]] and [[Semitic languages]]. In Latin we have ''spiritus'', in Greek ''pneuma'', in Hebrew ''ruach''. The idea is found extending other planes of culture in Australia, America and Asia.

For some of the [[Native Americans (U.S.)|Native Americans]] and [[First Nations]] the [[Roman religion|Roman]] custom of receiving the breath of a dying man was no mere pious duty but a means of ensuring that his soul was transferred to a new body. Other familiar conceptions identify the [[soul]] with the [[liver]] (see [[omen]]) or the [[heart]], with the reflected figure seen in the [[pupil]] of the [[eye]], and with the [[blood]]. 

Although the soul is often distinguished from the vital principle, there are many cases in which a state of unconsciousness is explained as due to the absence of the soul. In [[South Australia]] ''wilyamarraba'' (without soul) is the word used for insensible.  So too the [[autohypnosis|autohypnotic]] [[trance]] of the [[magician]] or ''[[shaman]]'' is regarded as due to their visit to distant regions or the [[netherworld]], of which they bring back an account. [[Telepathy]] or [[clairvoyance]], with or without [[trance]], may have operated to produce a conviction of the dual nature of man, for it seems possible that facts unknown to the [[automatism|automatist]] are sometimes discovered by means of [[crystal gazing]].

Sickness is often explained as due to the absence of the soul and means are sometimes taken to lure back the [[wandering soul]].  In [[China|Chinese]] tradition, when a person is at the point of death and their soul believed to have left their body, the patient's coat is held up on a long bamboo pole while a priest endeavours to bring the departed spirit back into the coat by means of [[incantation]]s.  If the bamboo begins to turn round in the hands of the relative who is deputed to hold it, it is regarded as a sign that the soul of the [[moribund]] has returned (see [[automatism]]).

More important perhaps than all these phenomena, because more regular and normal, was the daily period of [[sleep]] with its frequent fitful and incoherent ideas and images. The mere immobility of the body was sufficient to show that its state was not identical with that of waking. When, in addition, the sleeper awoke to give an account of visits to distant lands, from which, as modern [[psychic]]al investigations suggest, they may even have brought back veridical details, the conclusion must have been irresistible that in sleep something journeyed forth, which was not the body (see [[astral travel]]). In a minor degree, revival of [[memory]] during sleep and similar phenomena of the sub-conscious life may have contributed to the same result. [[Dreams]] are sometimes explained in animist cultures as journeys performed by the sleeper, sometimes as visits paid by other persons, by animals or objects to the sleeper. [[Hallucinations]], possibly more frequent in the lower stages of culture, must have contributed to fortify this interpretation, and the animistic theory in general. Seeing the [[phantasm]]ic figures of friends at the moment when they were, whether at the point of death or in good health, many miles distant, must have led people irresistibly to the [[dualistic theory]]. But hallucinatory figures, both in dreams and waking life, are not necessarily those of the living. From the reappearance of dead friends or enemies, primitive man was inevitably led to the belief that there existed an incorporeal part of man, which survived the dissolution of the body. The soul was conceived to be a facsimile of the body, sometimes no less material, sometimes more subtle but yet material, sometimes altogether impalpable and intangible.

If the phenomena of dreams were, as suggested above, of great importance for the development of animism, the belief, which must originally have been a doctrine of human [[psychology]], cannot have failed to expand speedily into a general [[philosophy]] of [[nature]]. Not only human beings but animals and objects are seen in dreams and the conclusion would be that they too have souls. The same conclusion may have been reached by another line of argument.

[[Folk psychology]] posited a spirit in a person to account, amongst other things, for their actions. A natural explanation of the changes in the external world would be that they are due to the operations and volitions of spirits.

But apart from considerations of this sort, it is probable that animals must have been regarded as possessing souls, early in the history of animistic beliefs. We may assume that man attributed a soul to the beasts of the field almost as soon as he claimed one for himself. 

The animist may attribute to animals the same sorts of ideas, the same soul, the same mental processes as himself, which may also be associated with greater power, cunning, or magical abilities.  Dead animals are sometimes credited with a knowledge of how their remains are treated, potentially with the power to take vengeance on the hunter if he is disrespectful. 

It is not surprising to find that many peoples respect and even worship animals (see ''[[totem]]'' or ''[[animal worship]]''), often regarding them as relatives. It is clear that widespread respect was paid to animals as the abode of dead ancestors, and much of the [[cult]]s to dangerous animals is traceable to this principle; though we need not attribute an animistic origin to it. 

With the rise of [[species]], [[deities]] and the cult of individual animals, the path towards [[anthropomorphization]] and [[polytheism]] is opened and the respect paid to animals tended to be reduced or lost entirely, especially in its strict animistic character.

==Plant souls==
Just as human souls are assigned to animals, so too are [[tree]]s and [[plant]]s often credited with souls, both human and animal in form. All over the world [[agricultural]] peoples practise elaborate ceremonies explicable, as [[Wilhelm Mannhardt]] has shown, on animistic principles. 

In Europe the [[John Barleycorn | corn spirit]] sometimes [[immanent]] in the crop, sometimes a presiding [[deity]] whose life does not depend on that of the growing corn, is conceived in some districts in the form of an [[ox]], [[hare]] or [[cock]], in others as an old man or woman. In the [[East Indies]] and Americas the [[rice]] or [[maize mother]] is a corresponding figure; in [[classical Europe]] and the [[Eastern world |East]] we have in [[Ceres]] and [[Demeter]], [[Adonis]] and [[Dionysus]], and other deities, vegetation gods whose origin we can readily trace back to the rustic corn spirit. 

[[Forest]] [[tree]]s, no less than [[cereal]]s,  may have their indwelling spirits.  The [[faun]]s and [[satyr]]s of classical literature were [[goat]]-footed; in [[Russia]], the [[tree spirit]] of the Russian peasantry takes the form of a [[goat]]. In [[Bengal]] and the [[East Indies]] woodcutters endeavour to propitiate the spirit of the tree which they cut down. In many parts of the world trees are regarded as the abode of the spirits of the dead. Just as a process of [[syncretism]] has given rise to cults of animal gods, tree spirits tend to become detached from the trees, which are thenceforward only their abodes. Here again animism has begun to pass into [[polytheism]].

== Object souls ==
Some cultures do not make a distinction between [[animate]] and inanimate objects.  Natural phenomenon, [[geographic]] features, everyday objects, and manufactured articles may also be attributed with souls.

In the north of Europe, in [[ancient Greece]], in [[China]], the water or river spirit is [[horse]] or [[bull]]-shaped. The water monster in serpent shape is even more widely found, but it is less strictly the spirit of the water. The spirit of syncretism manifests itself in this department of animism too, turning the immanent spirit into the presiding [[djinn]] or [[local god]] of later times.

== Animism and death==
In many parts of the world it is held that the human body is the seat of more than one soul. On the island of [[Nias]] four are distinguished: the shadow and the intelligence, which die with the body, a [[tutelary]] spirit, termed ''begoe'', and a second spirit, which is carried on the head. Similar ideas are found among the [[Euahlayi]] of southeast Australia, the [[Dakota]]s and many other tribes. Just as in Europe the [[ghost]] of a dead person is held to haunt the churchyard or the place of death, so do other cultures assign different abodes to the multiple souls with which they credit man. Of the four souls of a Dakota, one is held to stay with the corpse, another in the village, a third goes into the air, while the fourth goes to the land of souls, where its lot may depend on its rank in this life, its [[sex]], mode of death or sepulture, on the due observance of [[funeral]] ritual, or many other points.

From the belief in the survival of the dead arose the practice of offering food, lighting fires, etc., at the grave, at first, maybe, as an act of friendship or filial piety, later as an act of [[ancestor worship]]. The simple offering of food or shedding of blood at the grave develops into an elaborate system of [[sacrifice]]. Even where ancestor worship is not found, the desire to provide the dead with comforts in the future life may lead to the sacrifice of wives, slaves, animals, and so on, to the breaking or burning of objects at the grave or to the provision of the [[Charon (mythology)|ferryman]]'s toll: a coin put in the mouth of the corpse to pay the traveling expenses of the soul. But all is not finished with the passage of the soul to the land of the dead. The soul may return to avenge its death by helping to discover the murderer, or to wreak vengeance for itself. There is a widespread belief that those who die a violent death become malignant spirits and endanger the lives of those who come near the haunted spot. The woman who dies in childbirth becomes a [[pontianak]], and threatens the life of human beings. People resort to magical or religious means of repelling their spiritual dangers.

== Evil spirits ==
Side by side with the doctrine of separable souls with which we have so far been concerned, exists the belief in a great host of unattached spirits. These are not immanent souls that have become detached from their abodes, but have instead every appearance of independent spirits.

These spirits are at first mainly malevolent. Side by side with them we find the spirits of the dead as hostile beings. At a higher stage the spirits of dead kinsmen are no longer unfriendly, nor yet all non-human spirits. As [[fetish]]es, [[nagual]]s (see [[totem]]), [[familiar spirit]]s, gods or [[demi-gods]] (see also [[demonology]]), they enter into relations with man. On the other hand there still subsists a belief in innumerable evil spirits, which manifest themselves in the phenomena of [[possession]], [[lycanthropy]], disease, and so on. The fear of evil spirits has given rise to ceremonies of expulsion of evils (see [[exorcism]]), designed to banish them from the community.

== Differences between animism and religion ==
Animism is commonly described as the most primitive form of [[religion]], but properly speaking it is not a religion at all.  Animism is in the first instance an explanation of phenomena rather than an attitude of mind toward the cause of them, a [[philosophy]] rather than a religion. The term may, however, be conveniently used to describe the early stage of religion in which people endeavour to set up relations between themselves and the unseen powers, conceived as spirits, but differing in many particulars from the gods of [[polytheism]]. As an example of this stage in one of its aspects may be taken the European belief in the corn spirit, which is, however, the object of magical rather than religious rites.  Sir James G. Frazer, in ''The Golden Bough'', has thus defined the character of the animistic pantheon: 

:''they are restricted in their operations to definite departments of nature; their names are general, not proper; their attributes are generic rather than individual; in other words, there is an indefinite number of spirits of each class, and the individuals of a class are much alike; they have no definitely marked individuality; no accepted traditions are current as to their origin, life and character.''

This stage of religion is well illustrated by the [[Native American (U.S.)|Native American]] custom of offering sacrifice to certain rocks, or whirlpools, or to the indwelling spirits connected with them. The rite is only performed in the neighbourhood of the object, it is an incident of a [[canoe]] or other voyage, and is not intended to secure any benefits beyond a safe passage past the object in question. The spirit to be propitiated has a purely local sphere of influence, and powers of a very limited nature. Animistic in many of their features too are the temporary gods of [[fetishism]], naguals or familiars, [[Genie | genii]] and even the dead who receive a cult. With the rise of a belief in departmental gods comes the age of polytheism. The belief in [[elemental spirits]] may still persist, but they fall into the background and receive no cult.

== Animism and the origin of religion ==
Two animistic theories of the origin of [[religion]] have been put forward. The one, often termed the &quot;ghost theory,&quot; mainly associated with the name of [[Herbert Spencer]], but also maintained by [[Grant Allen]], refers the beginning of religion to the cult of dead human beings. 

The other, put forward by Dr. E. B. [[Tylor]], makes the foundation of all religion animistic, but recognizes the non-human character of polytheistic gods. Although ancestor-worship, or, more broadly, the [[cult]] of the dead, has in many cases overshadowed other cults or even extinguished them, we have no warrant, even in these cases, for asserting its priority, but rather the reverse. In the majority of cases the pantheon is made up by a multitude of spirits in human, sometimes in animal form, which bear no signs of ever having been incarnate. [[Sun god]]s and [[moon goddess]]es, gods of fire, wind and water, gods of the sea, and above all gods of the sky, show no signs of having been ghost gods at any period in their history. They may, it is true, be associated with ghost gods. In Australia it cannot even be asserted that the gods are spirits at all, much less that they are the spirits of dead men. They are simply magnified magicians, super-men who have never died. We have no ground, therefore, for regarding the cult of the dead as the origin of religion in this area. This conclusion is the more probable, as ancestor-worship and the cult of the dead generally cannot be said to exist in Australia.

The more general view that polytheistic and other [[gods]] are the elemental and other spirits of the later stages of animistic creeds, is equally inapplicable to Australia, where the belief seems to be neither animistic nor even animatistic in character. But we are hardly justified in arguing from the case of Australia to a general conclusion as to the origin of religious ideas in all other parts of the world. It is perhaps safest to say that the science of religions has no data on which to go, in formulating conclusions as to the original form of the objects of religious emotion. It must be remembered that not only is it very difficult to get precise information of the subject of the religious ideas of people of some other cultures, perhaps for the simple reason that the ideas themselves are far from precise, but also that, as has been pointed out above, the conception of spiritual often approximates very closely to that of material. Where the soul is regarded as no more than a finer sort of matter, it will obviously be far from easy to decide whether the gods are spiritual or material. Even, therefore, if we can say that at the present day the gods are entirely spiritual, it is clearly possible to maintain that they have been spiritualized ''pari passu'' with the increasing importance of the animistic view of nature and of the greater prominence of [[Eschatology | eschatological]] beliefs. The animistic origin of religion is therefore not proven.

== Animism and mythology ==
Little need be said on the relation of animism and [[mythology]]. While a large part of mythology has an animistic basis, it is possible to believe, e.g. in a sky world, peopled by corporeal beings, as well as by spirits of the dead.  The latter may even be entirely absent.  The mythology of the Australians relates largely to corporeal, non-spiritual beings.  Stories of transformation, [[deluge (mythology)]] and doom myths, or myths of the origin of death, have not necessarily any animistic basis. At the same time, with the rise of ideas as to a future life and spiritual beings, this field of mythology is immensely widened, though it cannot be said that a rich mythology is necessarily genetically associated with or combined with belief in many spiritual beings.

== Animism in philosophy ==
The term &quot;animism&quot; has been applied to many different philosophical systems. It is used to describe [[Aristotle]]'s view of the relation of soul and body held also by the [[Stoics]] and [[Scholastics]]. On the other hand [[monadology]] ([[Leibniz]]) has also been termed animistic. The name is most commonly applied to [[vitalism]], a view mainly associated with [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] and revived by [[F. Bouillier]] ([[1813]]-[[1899]]), which makes life, or life and mind, the directive principle in evolution and growth, holding that all cannot be traced back to chemical and mechanical processes, but that there is a directive force which guides energy without altering its amount. An entirely different class of ideas, also termed animistic, is the belief in the world soul, held by [[Plato]], [[Schelling]] and others.

== Tylor ==
Tylor argued that non-Western societies relied on animism to explain why things happen.  He further argued that animism is the earliest form of religion, and reveals that humans developed religions in order to explain things.  At the time that Tylor wrote, this theory was politically radical because it made the claim that non-Western peoples and in particular, non-Christian &quot;heathens&quot;, in fact do have religion.  However, since the publication of ''Primitive Culture'', Tylor's theories have come under criticism from three quarters.  First, some have questioned whether the beliefs of diverse peoples living in different parts of the world and not communicating with one another can be lumped together as one kind of religion. Second, some have questioned whether the basic function of religion really is to &quot;explain&quot; the universe (critics like Marrett and [[Emil Durkheim]] argued that religious beliefs have emotional and social, rather than intellectual, functions).  Finally, many now see Tylor's theories as [[ethnocentric]].  Not only was he imposing a contemporary and Western view of religion (that it explains the inexplicable) on non-Western cultures, he was also telling the story of a progression from religion (which provides poor explanations) to [[science]] (which provides good explanations) (see [[cultural evolution]]).

==List of phenomena believed to lead to animism==
Lists of phenomena from the contemplation of which &quot;the savage&quot; was led to believe in animism have been given by Sir [[E. B. Tylor]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Andrew Lang]] and others; an animated controversy arose between the former as to the priority of their respective lists. Among these phenomena are: 

* [[Trance]] 
* [[Unconsciousness]]
* [[Sickness]]
* [[Death]]
* [[Clairvoyance]]
* [[Dream]]s
* [[Apparition]]s of the [[dead]]
* [[Wraith (entity)|Wraith]]s
* [[Hallucination]]s
* [[Echo]]es
* [[Shadow]]s
* [[Reflection]]s

== The new animism ==
In an article entitled &quot;Revisiting Animism&quot;, Nurit Bird-David builds on the work of Irving Hallowell by discussing the animist worldview and lifeway of the Nayaka of India. Hallowell had learnt from the Ojibwa of southern central Canada that the humans are only one kind of 'person' among many. There are also 'rock persons', 'eagle persons' and so on. Hallowell and Bird-David discuss the ways in which particular indigenous cultures know how to relate to particular persons (individuals or groups). There is no need to talk of metaphysics or impute non-empirical 'beliefs' in discussing animism. What is required is an openness to consider that humans are neither separate from the world nor distinct from other kinds of being in most significant ways. The new animism also makes considerably more sense of attempts to understand 'totemism' as an understanding that humans are not only closely related to other humans but also to particular animals, plants, etc. It also helps by providing a term for the communities among whom shamans work: they are animists not 'shamanists'. Shamans are employed among animist communities to engage or mediate with other-than-human persons in situations that would be fraught or dangerous for un-initiated, untrained or non-skillful people. The -ism of 'animism' should not suggest an overly systematic approach (but this is true of the lived reality of most religious people), but it is preferable to the term ''[[shamanism]]'' which has led many commentators to construct an elaborate system out of the everyday practices of animists and those they employ to engage with other-than-human persons. 
The new animism is most fully discussed in a recent book by Graham Harvey, ''Animism: Respecting the Living World''. But it is also significant in the 'animist realist' novels now being written among many indigenous communities worldwide. The term 'animist realism' was coined by Harry Garuba, a Nigerian scholar of literature, in comparison with 'magical realism' that describes works such as Marquez's ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]''.

[[Image:Vivaldi.jpg|right|thumb|210px|Unconfirmed portrait of Antonio Vivaldi]]

'''Antonio Lucio Vivaldi''' ([[March 4]], [[1678]] &amp;ndash; [[July 28]], [[1741]]),  nicknamed '''Il Prete Rosso''', meaning &quot;The Red Priest,&quot; was an [[Italy|Italian]] priest and [[baroque music]] composer.
 
==Biography== 
Antonio Lucio Vivaldi was born on [[March 4]], [[1678]] in [[Venice]], [[Italy]]. He was baptized immediately at his home by the midwife due to ''danger of death''. It is not determined what that means but it probably refered to an earthquake that shook the city that day or the infant's poor health. Vivaldi's official church baptism didn't take place until 2 months later. His father, Giovanni Battista, a [[barber]] before becoming a professional [[violinist]], taught him to play violin at first, then toured Venice playing violin with his father. Vivaldi had a medical problem which he called the ''tightening of the chest'' ([[asthma]]). His medical problem, however did not prevent him from learning to play the violin, compose and take part in any musical activities. At the age of 15 ([[1693]]) he began studying to become a priest. In [[1703]], 10 years later, at the age of 25, Vivaldi was ordained as a priest, soon nicknamed ''Il Prete Rosso'', &quot;The Red Priest,&quot; probably because of his red hair.  

Not long after, in [[1704]], he was given a dispensation from celebrating the [[Holy Mass]] because of his ill-health (he apparently suffered from [[asthma]], a breathing disorder) and in late [[1706]] he withdrew from the priesthood and became ''maestro di violino'' at an orphanage for girls called the [[Pio Ospedale della Pietà]] in [[Venice]]. Shortly after his appointment, the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad too; Vivaldi wrote for them most of his concertos, cantatas, and sacred music. In [[1705]] the first collection (''[[raccolta]]'') of his works was published. Many others would follow.  At the orphanage he covered several different duties, with the only interruption for his many travels.  In [[1709]], he was let go for economic reasons, but in [[1711]], he was offered the job again and in [[1713]] became responsible for the musical activity of the institute.  

Vivaldi was promoted to ''maestro de' concerti'' in [[1716]]. It was during these years that Vivaldi wrote much of his music, including many operas and concertos. In [[1718]], Vivaldi began to travel. Despite his frequent travels, the Pietà paid him to write two concertos a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least four times when in [[Venice]]. The Pietà's records show that he was paid for 140 concertos between [[1723]] and [[1729]]. Not so well known is the fact that most of his repertoire was re-discovered only in the first half of the [[20th century]] in [[Turin]] and [[Genoa]], but was published in the second half.  Vivaldi's music is innovative, breaking a consolidated tradition in schemes; he gave brightness to the formal and the rhythmic structure of the concerto, repeatedly looking for [[harmonic]] contrasts, and invented innovative melodies and themes. Moreover, Vivaldi was able to compose non-academic music, particularly meant to be appreciated by the wide public, and not only by an intellectual minority. The joyful appearance of his music reveals in this regard a transmissible joy of composing. These are among the causes of the vast popularity of his music. This popularity soon made him famous also in countries like [[France]], at the time very independent in its musical taste.

Vivaldi is considered one of the composers who brought [[Baroque Music|Baroque music]] (with its typical contrast among heavy sonorities) to evolve into a classical style.   [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was deeply influenced by Vivaldi's concertos and arias (recalled in his [[Passion]]s and [[cantata]]s). Bach transcribed a number of Vivaldi's concertos for solo keyboard, along with a number for orchestra, including the famous Concerto for Four Violins and Violoncello, Strings and Continuo ([[Ryom Verzeichnis|RV]] 580). However, not all musicians have shown the same enthusiasm: [[Igor Stravinsky]] provocatively said that Vivaldi had not written hundreds of concertos, but one concerto,   hundreds of times. Despite his priestly status, he is supposed to have had possible love affairs, one of which was with the [[singer]] [[Anna Giraud]], with whom he was suspected of reusing materials from old Venetian operas, which   he only slightly adapted to the vocal capabilities of his protegée. This business caused him some troubles with other musicians, like [[Benedetto Marcello]], who wrote a [[pamphlet]] against him.  There is no concrete evidence, however, that links Vivaldi romantically to anyone.

Vivaldi's life, like those of many composers of the time, ended in poverty. His compositions no longer held the high esteem they once did in Venice; changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded, and Vivaldi, in response, chose to sell off sizeable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance a migration to [[Vienna]]. Reasons for Vivaldi's departure from Venice are unclear, but it seems likely that he wished to meet [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]], who adored his compositions (Vivaldi dedicated ''La Cetra'' to Charles in [[1727]]), and take up the position of royal composer in his Imperial Court. But shortly after Vivaldi's arrival at Vienna, Charles died. This tragic stroke of bad luck left the composer without royal protection and a source of income. Vivaldi had to sell off more manuscripts to make ends meet, and eventually died not long after, in [[1741]]. He was given an unmarked pauper's grave (the assumption that the young [[Joseph Haydn]] sang in the choir at Vivaldi's burial was based on the mistranscription of a primary source and has been proven wrong). Equally unfortunate, his music was to fall into obscurity until the [[20th century]]. His burial spot is next to the Karlskirche in Vienna, at the site of the Technical Institute.  The house he lived in while in Vienna was torn down.  In its place now stands the Hotel Sacher.  Memorial plaques have been placed at both locations, as well as a Vivaldi &quot;star&quot; in the Viennese Musikmeile and a monument at the Rooseveltsplatz.

==Posthumous reputation==
Vivaldi remained known for his published concerti, and largely ignored, even after the resurgence of interest in Bach, pioneered by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. The resurrection of Vivaldi's unpublished works in the 20th century is mostly thanks to the efforts of [[Alfredo Casella]], who in [[1939]], organised the now historic ''Vivaldi Week'', in which the rediscovered ''Gloria in excelsis'' ([[Ryom Verzeichnis|RV]]  589) was first heard again. Discoveries continue to be made: a setting of ''Nisi Dominus'' (RV 803)  was discovered as recently as 2003, in a German library among manuscripts of [[Galuppi]]; it was recorded in 2005. Following World war II Vivaldi's compositions have enjoyed almost universal success, and the advent of [[historically informed performance]]s has all but catapulted him to stardom once again. In [[1947]], the Venetian businessman [[Antonio Fanna]] founded the [[Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi]], with the composer [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]] as its artistic director, with the purpose of promoting Vivaldi's music and putting out new editions of his works. 

Three films about Antonio Vivaldi are in production as of [[2005]]. One of them, with the working title ''Vivaldi'', will be directed by [[Catherine Hardwicke]] for Emagine Entertainment, while the second could have [[Ashley MacIsaac]] in the title role.  A third, made by French/Italian producers with Stefano Dionisi as Vivaldi and Michel Serrault in the main roles, is scheduled to be completed in [[2005]].

Vivaldi's music, together with [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s, [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s and [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]]'s, has been included in the theories of [[Alfred Tomatis]] on the effects of music on human behaviour, and used in [[music therapy]].   

The 11-movement &quot;Dixit Dominus&quot; for choir and soloists, uncovered in the German city of Dresden in early [[2005]], will be played there in full in [[2006]].

He was a prolific [[composer]] and is most well-known for composing:

*over 500 [[Concerto|concertos]] (210 of which were for violin or violoncello ''solo''), 
*46 [[opera]]s, 
*sinfonias, 
*73 sonatas, 
*[[chamber music]] (even if some sonatas for [[flute]], as ''Il Pastor Fido'', have been erroneously attributed to him, but were composed by [[Chédeville]]) and 
*[[sacred music]] (&quot;oratorio&quot; ''Juditha Triumphans'', written for Pietà, two ''Glorias'', the  ''Stabat Mater'', the ''Nisi Dominus'', the ''Beatus Vir'', the ''Magnificat'', the ''Dixit Dominus'' and others); 
*his most famous work is perhaps [[1723]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Le Quattro Stagioni]]'' (The Four Seasons). In essence, it resembled an early example of a [[tone poem]], where he attempted to capture all the moods of the four seasons without the use of [[percussion instrument|percussion]] to dramatize the effects he sought to portray.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Otherusesabout|a river in Switzerland}}
The '''Aar''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Aare'') is the longest [[river]] that both rises and ends entirely within [[Switzerland]].  

Its total length from its source to its junction with the [[Rhine]] comprises about 291 km (181 miles), during which distance it descends 1,565m (5,135 feet), draining an area of [[1 E10 m²|17,620 km²]] (6,804 square miles).

The Aar rises in the great [[Aar glaciers]] in the [[Canton of Bern|canton of Bern]] and west of the [[Grimsel Pass]]. It runs east to the Grimsel [[Hospice]], and then northwestery through the [[Hasli]] valley, forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, 46 m (151 feet), past [[Guttannen]], and piercing the limestone barrier of the Kirchet by a major [[Canyons of Switzerland|canyon]], before reaching [[Meiringen]], situated in a plain.  A little past Mieringen, near [[Brienz]], the river expands into [[Lake Brienz]] where it becomes navigable. Near the west end of the lake it receives its first important affluent, the [[Lütschine]]. It then runs across the swampy plain of the Bödeli between [[Interlaken]] and [[Unterseen]] before expanding once again into [[Lake Thun]].  

[[Image:Aare_river_in_Bern.jpg|thumb|right|Aare in Bern]]
Near the west end of Lake Thun, the river receives the waters of the [[Kander]], which has just been joined by the [[Simme]]. On flowing out of the lake it passes [[Thun]], and then circles a lofty bluff on which stands the town of [[Bern]]. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the [[Sanne|Saane or Sarine]] it turns north until it nears Aarberg. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the [[19th century]] the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a swampland through frequent floodings, was diverted by the [[Hagneck Canal]] into [[Lake Biel]]. From the upper end of the lake the river issues through the Nidau Canal and then runs east to [[Büren]]. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravels and snowmelt thet the river brings from the Alps and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the &quot;vegetable garden of Switzerland&quot;.

[[Image:Forest_route_near_Aare.jpg|thumb|left|Forest route near Aare]]
From here the Aar flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town [[Solothurn]] (below which the Grosse [[Emme]] flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), [[Olten]], [[Aarau]], near which is the junction with the Suhr, and Wildegg, where the Hallwiler Aa falls in on the right.  A short distance further, below [[Brugg]] it receives first the [[Reuss River|Reuss]], and shortly afterwards the [[Limmat]]. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself an affluent of the [[Rhine]], which it surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite at [[Koblenz, Switzerland|Coblenz (Switzerland)]], opposite [[Waldshut]], Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergeto|Abgarus of Edessa}}
'''Abgar''' or '''Agbar''' was the favored name among a dynasty of local rulers at [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in northern Mesopotamia, the most famous of whom figured in the forged correspondence with Jesus, accepted as genuine in [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''Ecclesiastical History'' and extensively quoted. The story of the conversion of Abgar to Christianity is traditionally linked to [[Abgarus of Edessa|Abgar V]], but Walter Bauer made a case for the Abgarus who converted being Abgar IX.

'''Abbotsford''' is a [[historic house]] in the region of [[Scottish Borders]] in the south of [[Scotland]], near [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]], on south bank of the [[River Tweed]]. It was formerly the residence of novelist [[Walter Scott]]. 

The nucleus of the estate was a small farm of 100 acres (0.4&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2;), called Cartleyhole, nicknamed Clarty (i.e., muddy) Hole, and bought by Scott on the lapse of his lease ([[1811]]) of the neighbouring house of Ashestiel. He at first built a small villa (now the western end of the house) and named it Abbotsford, creating the name from a ford near by where previously abbots of [[Melrose Abbey]] used to cross the river. Scott then built additions to the house and made it into a mansion, building into the walls many sculptured stones from ruined castles and abbeys of Scotland. In it he gathered a large library, and a collection of ancient [[furniture]], arms and armour, and other relics and curiosities, especially connected with [[Scottish history]].

The last and principal acquisition being that of Toftfield (afterwards named Huntlyburn), purchased in [[1817]].  The new house was then begun and completed in [[1824]].  

The general ground-plan is a parallelogram, with irregular outlines, one side overlooking the Tweed; and the style is mainly the [[Scottish Baronial]].  Into various parts of the fabric were built relics and curiosities from historical structures, such as the doorway of the old Tolbooth in [[Edinburgh]].  

Scott had only enjoyed his residence one year when ([[1825]]) he met with that reverse of fortune which involved the estate in debt.  In [[1830]] the library and museum were presented to him as a free gift by the creditors.  The property was wholly disencumbered in [[1847]] by Robert Cadell, the publisher, who cancelled the bond upon it in exchange for the family's share in the copyright of Sir Walter's works.  

[[Image:Wfm abbotsford.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Abbotsford House (north elevation)]]

Scott's only son Walter did not live to enjoy the property, having died on his way from [[India]] in [[1847]].  Among subsequent possessors were Scott's son-in-law, J. G. Lockhart, J. R. Hope Scott, [[Q.C.]], and his daughter (Scott's great-granddaughter), the Hon. Mrs Maxwell Scott.  

Abbotsford gave its name to the &quot;Abbotsford Club,&quot; a successor of the [[Bannatyne Club|Bannatyne]] and Maitland clubs, founded by W. B. D. D. Turnbull in [[1834]] in Scott's honour, for printing and publishing historical works connected with his writings.  Its publications extended from [[1835]] to [[1864]].

The house continued to be occupied by Scott's descendents for several generations, and was opened to the public in recent times. However in 2005 it was announced that following the death of Dame Jean Maxwell Scott, the great, great, great grand-daughter of the writer the previous year, it was not possible for any family member to live at Abbotsford. [[Historic Scotland]] and the [[National Trust for Scotland]] are attempting to secure the house's future.  However, Scottish Borders Council are considering an  
application by a property developer to build a housing estate on the opposite bank of the River Tweed from Abbotsford.  If the council give this development the go ahead it will forever ruin the views Sir Walter enjoyed from his study. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,173-1617987,00.html]

'''Abraham''' ('''אַבְרָהָם''' &quot;Father/Leader of many&quot;, (circa 1900 BCE) [[Standard Hebrew]] '''Avraham''',  [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''{{IPA|ʾAḇrāhām}}'''; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''ابراهيم''' '''{{IPA|Ibrāhīm}}'''; [[Geez]] አብርሃም '''{{IPA|ʾAbrəham}}''') is regarded as a [[patriarch]] of Israelite religion, recognized by [[Judaism]] and later [[Christianity]], and a very important [[prophet]] in [[Islam]] as well as in the [[Baha'i Faith]]. Traditions regarding his life are given in the [[Book of Genesis]] and also in the [[Qur'an]].

Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are sometimes referred to as the &quot;[[Abrahamic religion]]s&quot;, because of the role Abraham plays in their holy books and beliefs. In the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Qur'an]], Abraham is described as a patriarch blessed by God (the Jewish people called him &quot;Father Abraham&quot;), and [[promise]]d great things, father of the People of Israel through his son [[Isaac]]; the Muslims regard [[Ishmael]] as the father of the [[Arab]]s.  In Islam, Abraham is considered to be one of the most important of the many prophets sent by God. In Christian belief, Abraham is a model of faith, and his intention to obey God by offering up Isaac is seen as a foreshadowing of God's offering of his son, [[Jesus]]. In Islamic belief, Abraham obeyed God by offering up Ishmael.

His original name was '''Abram''' ('''אַבְרָם''' &quot;High/Exalted father/leader&quot;, [[Standard Hebrew]] '''Avram''', [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''ʾAḇrām'''); he was the foremost of the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]]. Later in life he went by the name Abraham. There is no contemporary mention of his life, and no source earlier than ''Genesis'' mentions him. 

According to calculations derived from the [[Masoretic]] Hebrew [[Torah]], Abraham was born 1,948 years after creation and lived for 175 years, which would correspond to a life spanning from 1812 [[Common Era|BCE]] to 1637 [[Common Era|BCE]] by Jewish dating; or from 2166 [[Common Era|BCE]] to 1991 [[Common Era|BCE]] by other calculations. The figures in the [[book of Jubilees]] have Abraham born 1,876 years after creation, and 534 years before the Exodus; the ages provided in the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan version of Genesis]] agree closely with those of Jubilees before the Deluge, but after the Deluge, they add roughly 100 years to each of the ages of the Patriarchs in the Masoretic Text, resulting in the figure of 2,247 years after creation for Abraham's birth.  The Greek [[Septuagint]] version adds around 100 years to nearly ''all'' of the patriarchs' births, producing the even higher figure of 3,312 years after creation for Abraham's birth.

[[Image:Abraham.jpg|thumb|300px|right|&quot;Abraham Sacrificing Isaac&quot; by Laurent de LaHire, 1650]]

==Abraham in Judaism==
The account of his life is found in the Book of [[Genesis]], beginning in Chapter 11, at the close of a [[genealogy]] of the sons of [[Shem]] (which includes among its members [[Eber]], the [[eponym]] of the [[Hebrews]]).

His father [[Terah]] came from [[Ur]] of the [[Chaldea|Chaldees]], popularly identified only since 1927 (thanks to Sir [[Charles Woolley]]) with the ancient city in southern [[Mesopotamia]] which was under the rule of the Chaldeans &amp;mdash; although [[Josephus]], Islamic tradition and Jewish authorities like Maimonides all concur that [[Ur-Of-The-Khaldis]] was in Northern Mesopotamia (where is now [[Kurdistan]]) (Identified with [[Urartu]], [[Urfa]], and [[Kutha]] respectively). This is in keeping with the local tradition that Abraham was born in Urfa; or with the nearby [[Urkesh]], which others identify with &quot;Ur of the Chaldees&quot;. They also say &quot;Chaldees&quot; refers to a group of gods called [[Khaldis]]. Abram migrated to [[Harran]], apparently the classical [[Carrhae]], on a branch of the [[Habor]]. Thence, after a short stay, he, his wife [[Sarah|Sarai]], [[Lot (biblical)|Lot]] (the son of Abram's brother [[Haran]]), and all their followers, departed for [[Canaan]]. There are two cities possibly identifiable with the biblical Ur, neither far from Haran: Ura and Urfa, a northern Ur also being mentioned in tablets at [[Ugarit]], [[Nuzi]], and [[Ebla]]. These possibly refer to Ur, Ura, and Urau (See ''BAR'' January 2000, page 16). Moreover, the names of Abram's forefathers [[Peleg]], [[Serug]], [[Nahor]], and Terah, all appear as names of cities in the region of Haran (''Harper's Bible Dictionary'', page 373). [[Yahweh]] called Abram to go to &quot;the land I will show you&quot;, and promised to bless him and make him (though hitherto childless) a great nation. Trusting this promise, Abram journeyed down to [[Shechem]], and at the sacred tree (compare Gen. 25:4, [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 24:26, [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 9:6) received a new promise that the land would be given unto his seed (descendant or descendants). Having built an [[altar]] to commemorate the [[theophany]], he removed to a spot between [[Bethel]] and [[Ai (biblical)|Ai]], where he built another altar and called upon (i.e. invoked) the name of Yahweh (Gen. 12:1-9).

Here he dwelt for some time, until strife arose between his herdsmen and those of Lot. Abram thereupon proposed to Lot that they should separate, and allowed his nephew the first choice. Lot preferred the fertile land lying east of the [[Jordan River]], while Abram, after receiving another promise from Yahweh, moved down to the oaks of [[Mamre]] in [[Hebron]] and built an altar.

In the subsequent history of Lot and the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], Abram appears prominently in a passage where he intercedes with Yahweh on behalf of Sodom, and is promised that if ten righteous men can be found therein, the city shall be preserved (18:16-33).

Driven by a [[famine]] to take refuge in [[Egypt]] (26:11, 41:57, 42:1), Abram feared lest his wife's beauty should arouse the evil designs of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and thus endanger his own safety, and alleged that Sarai was his sister. This did not save her from the [[Pharaoh]], who took her into the royal [[harem]] and enriched Abram with herds and servants. But when Yahweh &quot;plagued Pharaoh and his house with great [[Plagues of Egypt|plagues]]&quot; Abram and Sarai left Egypt.

There are two other parallel tales in Genesis of [[a wife confused for a sister]] (Genesis 20-21 and 26) describing a similar event at Gerar with the [[Philistine]] king Abimelech, though the latter attributing it to Isaac not Abraham.

As Sarai was infertile, God's promise that Abram's seed would inherit the land seemed incapable of fulfillment.  His sole heir was his servant, who was over his household, a certain [[Eliezer of Damascus]] (15:2). Abraham is now promised as heir one of his own flesh. The passage recording the ratification of the promise is remarkably solemn (see [[Genesis]] 15).

Sarai, in accordance with custom, gave to Abram her Egyptian handmaid [[Hagar]], who, when she found she was with child, presumed upon her position to the extent that Sarai, unable to endure the reproach of barrenness (cf. the story of [[Hannah]], [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 1:6), dealt harshly with her and forced her to flee (16:1-14).  Hagar is promised that her descendants will be too numerous to count, and she returns. Her son [[Ishmael]] thus was Abram's [[firstborn]] (and [[Islam]]ic doctrine holds that he was the rightful [[heir]]). Hagar and Ishmael were eventually driven permanently away from Abram by Sarah (chapter 21).

The name ''Abraham'' was given to Abram (and the name [[Sarah]] to Sarai) at the same time as the covenant of [[circumcision]] (chapter 17), which is practiced in [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] to this day. At this time Abraham was promised not only many descendants, but descendants through Sarah specifically, as well as the land where he was living, which was to belong to his descendants. The covenant was to be fulfilled through [[Isaac]], though God promised that Ishmael would become a great nation as well. The covenant of circumcision (unlike the earlier promise) was two-sided and conditional: if Abraham and his descendants fulfilled their part of the covenant, Yahweh would be their God and give them the land.

The promise of a son to Abraham made Sarah &quot;laugh,&quot; which became the name of the son of promise, Isaac. Sarah herself &quot;laughs&quot; at the idea, when Yahweh appears to Abraham at Mamre (18:1-15) and, when the child is born, cries &quot;God hath made me laugh; every one that heareth will laugh at me&quot; (21:6).

In Genesis 18, Abraham pleads with God not to destroy [[Sodom]], and God agrees that he would not destroy the city if there were 50 righteous people in it, or 45, or 30, 20, even 10 righteous people. (Abraham's nephew [[Lot (biblical)|Lot]] had been living in Sodom.)

Some time after the birth of Isaac, Abraham was commanded by God to offer his son up as a sacrifice in the land of [[Moriah]]. Proceeding to obey, he was prevented by an [[angel]] as he was about to sacrifice his son, and slew a [[Domestic sheep|ram]] which he found on the spot. As a reward for his obedience he received another promise of a numerous seed and abundant prosperity (22). Then he returned to [[Beersheba]]. The [[Binding of Isaac|near sacrifice of Isaac]] is one of the most challenging, and perhaps [[ethics|ethic]]ally troublesome, parts of the Bible.  

According to Josephus, Isaac is 25 years old at the time of the sacrifice or ''Akedah'', while the [[Talmud]]ic sages teach that Isaac is 37. In either case, Isaac is a fully grown man, old enough to prevent the elderly Abraham (who is 125 or 137 years old) from tying him up had he wanted to resist. 

The primary interest of the narrative now turns to Isaac. To his &quot;only son&quot; (22:2, 12) Abraham gave all he had, and dismissed the sons of his concubines to the lands outside [[Canaan]]; they were thus regarded as less intimately related to [[Isaac]] and his descendants (25:1-6). See also: [[Midianites]], [[Sheba]].

Sarah died at an old age, and was buried in the [[Cave of Machpelah]] near [[Hebron]], which Abraham had purchased, along with the adjoining field, from [[Ephron the Hittite]] (Genesis 23). Here Abraham himself was buried.  Centuries later the tomb became a place of [[pilgrimage]] and [[Muslim]]s later built an [[Islam]]ic [[mosque]] inside the site.

Abraham is considered the father of the Jewish nation, as their first Patriarch, and having a son (Isaac), who in turn begat [[Jacob]], and from there the [[Israelite|Twelve Tribes]]. To father the nation, God &quot;tested&quot; Abraham with ten tests, the greatest being his willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac. God promised the land of Israel to his children, and that is the first claim of the Jews to Israel.

Judaism ascribes a special trait to each Patriarch. Abraham's had kindness. Because of this, Judaism considers kindness to be an inherent Jewish trait.

Jewish tradition teaches the origins of Abraham's [[monotheism]]. His father Terah owned a store that sold idols. Abraham, at the age of three, started to question their authenticity. This culminated in Abraham destroying some idols.

Abraham was then brought to the king, and sentenced to death, along with his brother Haran, unless they recanted their position. Abraham did not, and was thrown into a fire. When Abraham exited unscathed, Haran also would not recant, and was thrown into the fire. Haran, who did not truly believe, died in the fire. This is hinted at in Genesis 11:28.

Abraham then went to the city of Haran with his father and brother. His father died there. God spoke to Abraham for the first time, and told him of great things He would give him if he would leave Haran. Abraham did. He was seventy-five during this time.

Abraham started a school for teaching his beliefs in God, and some say he wrote the [[Sefer Yetzirah]].

== Abraham in Christianity ==
Abraham stands out prominently as the recipient of the promises (Gen. 12:2-7, 13:14-17, 15, 17, 18:17-19, 22:17-18, 24:7). In the [[New Testament]] Abraham is mentioned prominently as a man of [[faith]] (see e.g., [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 11), and the apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] uses him as an example of [[salvation]] by faith (in e.g. [[Epistle to Galatians|Galatians]] 3).  Abraham also plays significantly in the theology of [[Paul]] as the progenator of the [[Christ]] (or [[Messiah]]) (see [[Galatians]] 3:16).

Authors of the New Testament report that Jesus cited Abraham to support belief in the [[resurrection]] of the dead. &quot;But concerning the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of [[Moses]], in the [[burning bush]] passage, how God spoke to him, saying, &quot;I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?&quot; He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. You are therefore greatly mistaken.&quot; ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 12:26-27) &quot;By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was said, &quot;In Isaac your seed shall be called,&quot; concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.&quot; (''Hebrews'' 11:17-19)

The [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]], [[Baptist]] and traditional [[Protestant]] view in Christianity is that the chief promise made to Abraham in ''Genesis'' 12 is that through Abraham's seed, all the people of earth would be blessed. This promise was fulfilled through Abraham's seed, Jesus. It is also a consequence of this promise that Christianity is open to people of all races and not limited to the Jews.  

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] calls Abraham &quot;our father in Faith,&quot; in the [[Eucharistic prayer]] called the ''Roman Canon'', recited during the [[Mass]].  (See [[Abraham in Liturgy]]).

Christian tradition sees Abraham as a figure of God, and Abraham's attempt to offer up [[Isaac]] is a foreshadowing of [[God]]'s offering of his Son, [[Jesus]] (Gen. 22:1-14; Heb. 11:17-19). Just as Isaac carried wood for the sacrifice up the mountain and willingly submitted to being offered, so Jesus carried his [[Cross]] up the hill and allowed himself to be [[crucified]].

==Abraham in Islam==
Abraham (called '''Ibrahim''') is very important in [[Islam]], both in his own right as prophet and as the father of the prophet [[Ishmael|Ismail]] (Ishmael), his firstborn son, who is considered the ''Father of the Arabs''. Abraham is considered one of the first and most important prophets of Islam, and is commonly termed ''Khalil Ullah'', Friend of God. (Islam regards most of the [[Old Testament]] &quot;patriarchs&quot; as [[prophets of Islam|prophets]] of God, and hence as Muslims.)  

The faith of Abraham is called [[Millat-e-Ibrahim]] in the [[Qur'an]]. Muslims believe that Abraham was a prophet of God, in accordance with the narrative of his life in the [[Qur'an]]. In the Qur'an, Muslims are instructed to pray facing in the direction of the [[Ka'bah]] in [[Mecca]], which is described as having been built by Abraham and his son Ismail ([[al-Baqara|Qur'an 2]]:125). Abraham also takes an important role in one of the [[Pillars of Islam]], the [[Hajj]], which is a pilgrimage to the Holy Mosque. A part of the Hajj is a commemoration of the sacrifice of the wife of Abraham, Hagar, for her son Ismail, when Abraham had settled his wife and son in the valley of Mecca by God's order to pioneer a civilization. (It was from this civilization that the final prophet of Islam, [[Muhammad]], was later born)

Muslims have a specific ''[[dua]]'' that (in some traditions) they recite daily which asks God to bless both Abraham and [[Muhammad]]. Islamic prayer, [[Salat]], that occurs five times a day, also includes many parts that ask God for his blessings upon Abraham; the most in the prayer. According to Islamic tradition, he is buried in [[Hebron]]. In the [[Masjid al Haram]] in [[Mecca]], there is an area known as the &quot;station of Ibrahim&quot; (''Maqam Ibrahim'' مقام), which bears an impression of his footprints.

There are numerous references to Abraham in the Qur'an. According to the Qur'an, Abraham is the spritual father of all the believers.  He is mentioned as an upright person who was neither a polytheist nor a Christian or a Jew ([[Al Imran|Qur'an 3]]:67). An example is like the one below:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''O ye who believe! Bow down and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord, and do good, that haply ye may prosper And strive for Allah with the endeavor which is His right. He hath chosen you and hath not laid upon you in religion any hardship; the faith of your father Abraham (is yours). He hath named you Muslims of old time and in this (Scripture), that the messenger may be a witness against you, and that ye may be witnesses against mankind. So establish worship, pay the poor due, and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protecting Friend. A blessed Patron and a blessed Helper.'' ([[Al-Hajj|Qur'an 22]]:78)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Qur'an, Abraham reached the conclusion that anything subject to disappearance could not be worthy of worship, and thus became a [[monotheist]] ([[Al-An'am|Qura'n 6]]:76-83). While some Muslims &amp;mdash; like Jews &amp;mdash; believe that Azar who was an idol-maker was the father of Abraham, majority of the Muslims believe that Tarakh was his father and Azar was Abraham's uncle [http://al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter5a/8.html (Father of Ibrahim).] Abraham broke his uncle's idols, calling on his community to worship God instead. They then cast him into a fire, which miraculously failed to burn him ([[as-Saaffat|Qur'an 37]]:83-98). The well-known but wholly non-canonical ''Qisas al-Anbiya'' ([[Ibn Kathir]]) records considerably more detail about his life, which are commonly referred to in Islamic accounts of his life.

Traditionally, Muslims believe that it was [[Ishmael]] rather than [[Isaac]] whom Abraham was told to sacrifice.  In support of this, Muslims note that the text of [[Genesis (Hebrew Bible)|Genesis]], despite specifying Isaac, appears to state that Abraham was told to sacrifice his only son (&quot;Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac,&quot; [http://www.breslov.com/bible/ Jewish Publication Society] translation, Genesis/Bereshit 22:2) to God. Since Isaac was Abraham's second son, it is arguable there was no time at which he would have been Abraham's &quot;only son&quot;, and that this supports the Muslim belief that there was an original text that must have named Ishmael rather than Isaac as the intended sacrifice. The [[Qur'an]] itself does not specify by name which son Abraham nearly sacrificed saying only that it was his only son ([[As-Saaffat|Qur'an 37]]:99-111). Isaac ([[Ishaq]] in Islam) is also considered a prophet in Islam.

Also, unlike Jewish belief, Muslims note that nowhere in the Qur'an does God say that it was He who told Abraham to sacrifice his son nor does God say He gave Abraham the dream of the sacrifice. The Qur'an teaches that God never advocates evil. Thus, it is said that for a father to slaughter his son, is an evil that cannot be coming from God; it can only come from [[Satan]]. Furthermore, Muslims state that God would not contradict Himself and, therefore, would not order Abraham to commit what he prohibited, even as a test. Since Abraham thought the dream was from God and he proceeded to sacrifice his son Ismail, God sent him the lamb to be sacrificed instead, and to save Ismail and the father-son sacred relationship. Furthermore, Muslims believe that God promised to protect His righteous believers from Satan's tricks, and he saved Abraham and his son, Ismail, from this exact test.

It is believed that Ibrahim's dream was a test from God. And when Ibrahim told his dream to Ismail, it was Ismail who convinced Ibrahim to fulfill God's order. So this was test for both Ibrahim, whom had longed for a son for such a long time, and for Ismail. When the devil teased them before the sacrifice, Ibrahim and Ismail threw stones at the devil. This reincarnated as jumrah, one of the rites undertaken by Muslims making the Hajj (pilgrimage). The entire episode of the sacrifice is regarded as a trial that Abraham had to face from God. It is celebrated by Muslims on the day of [[Eid ul-Adha]].

==Abraham in the Bahá'í Faith==
Bahá'ís believe that Abraham was a &quot;[[Manifestation of God]],&quot; or one in a line of prophets who have revealed the Word of God progressively for a gradually maturing humanity. In this way, Abraham shares an exalted station with [[Moses]], [[Buddha]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], [[the Báb]], and the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. In addition, Bahá'u'lláh, a Persian, is claimed to be descended from Abraham through Abraham's wife [[Keturah]], asserting the Bahá'í Faith the same organic connection to Abraham that is claimed by Judaism and Christianity (through Sarah) and Islam (through Hagar).

==Abraham in the Hindu belief==
Theories speculate that Abraham may also be connected with Hinduism, remembered as the god Brahma, or Ram (who could have been called &quot;Ab Ram&quot; or &quot;Father Ram.&quot; Striking coincidences fuel this theory: Abraham, who was known earlier in life as &quot;Abram&quot; was married to Sarah, who had changed her name from Sarai. In Hindu belief, &quot;Brahma&quot; was married to &quot;Saraisvati.&quot; Additionally, Abraham and Sarah were both relatives and spouses; the same was true of Brahma and Saraisvati. Abraham is also claimed to be the founder of the ancient Sabean religion. 

==Abraham in philosophy==
Abraham, as a man communicating with God or the divine, has inspired some fairly extensive discussion in some [[philosopher]]s, such as [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].  Kierkegaard goes into Abraham's plight in considerable detail in his work ''[[Fear and Trembling]]''.  Sartre understands the story not in terms of Christian obedience or a &quot;teleological suspension of the ethical&quot;, but in terms of mankind's utter behavioral and moral freedom. God asks Abraham to sacrifice his only son. Sartre doubts that Abraham can know that the voice he hears is really the voice of his God and not of someone else, or the product of a mental condition. Thus, Sartre concludes, even if there are signs in the world, humans are totally free to decide how to interpret them.

==Abraham and his descendants (Biblical Perspective) ==
''For a full account of the '''historicity''' of Abrahamic stories in the book of'' [[Genesis]], ''see'' [[The Bible and history#The Patriarchs|Historicity of the Patriarchs]].

Biblical narratives represent Abraham as a wealthy, powerful and supremely virtuous man, but humanly flawed, and when afraid for himself, miscalculating, and a sometimes deceiver and an inconsiderate husband. But his central importance in the book of Genesis, and his portrait as a man favored by God, is unequivocal.  Abraham's generations (Hebrew: ''[[toledoth]]'', translated to Greek: &quot;Genesis&quot;) are presented as part of the crowning explanation of how the world has been fashioned by the hand of God, and how the boundaries and relationships of peoples were established by him.

As the father of Isaac and Ishmael, Abraham is ultimately the common ancestor of the [[Israelites]] and their neighbours. As the father of [[Ishmael]], whose twelve sons became desert princes (most prominently, [[Nebaioth]] and [[Kedar]]), along with [[Midian]], [[Sheba]] and other [[Arab]]ian tribes (25:1-4), the book of Genesis gives a portrait of Isaac's descendants as being surrounded by kindred peoples, who are also oft-times enemies.  It seems that some degree of kinship was felt by the [[Hebrews]] with the dwellers of the more distant south, and it is characteristic of the genealogies that the mothers (Sarah, the Egyptian Hagar, and [[Keturah]]) are in the descending scale, perhaps of purity of blood, or as of purity of relationship, or of connectedness to Sarah: Sarah, her servant, her husband's other wife (or concubine). The Bible says of the Hebrew people: &quot;Your father was a wandering Syrian&quot;.

As stated above, Abraham came from Ur in [[Babylonia]] to Haran and thence to [[Canaan]]. Late tradition supposed that the [[Migration (human)|migration]] was to escape Babylonian idolatry ([[Judith]] 5, [[Jubilees]] 12; cf. [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 24:2), and knew of Abraham's miraculous escape from death (an obscure reference to some act of deliverance in [[Isaiah]] 29:22). The route along the banks of the [[Euphrates]] from south to north was so frequently taken by migrating tribes that the tradition has nothing improbable in itself. It was thence that [[Jacob]], the father of the tribes of Israel, came, and the route to [[Shechem]] and [[Bethel]] is precisely the same in both.  A twofold migration is doubted by some, but from what is known of the situation in [[Canaan]] in the [[15th century BC]], not at all impossible.

Further, there is yet another parallel in the story of the conquest by Joshua, partly implied and partly actually detailed (cf. also Joshua 8:9 with Gen. 12:8, 13:3), whence it would appear that too much importance must not be laid upon any [[ethnological]] interpretation which fails to account for the three versions. That similar traditional elements have influenced them is not unlikely; but to recover the true historical foundation is difficult. The invasion or immigration of certain tribes from the east of the [[Jordan]]; the presence of [[Aramean]] blood among the Israelites; the origin of the sanctity of venerable sites &amp;mdash; these and other considerations may readily be found to account for the traditions.

Noteworthy coincidences in the lives of Abraham and Isaac, such as the strong parallels between two tales of [[a wife confused for a sister]], point to the fluctuating state of traditions in the oral stage, or suggest that Abraham's life has been built up by borrowing from the common stock of popular lore. More original is the parting of Lot and Abraham at Bethel. The district was the scene of contests between [[Moab]] and the Hebrews (cf. perhaps [[Judges]] 3), and if this explains part of the story, the physical configuration of the [[Dead Sea]] may have led to the legend of the destruction of inhospitable and vicious cities.

===Arab connection===
Although historians have no non-religious evidence for Abraham's connection to the Arabs, and the historicity of Biblical accounts is questioned by academics (see [[The Bible and history]]), some believe that the area outlined as the final destination of Ishmael and his descendants (from Havilah to Assyria) refers to  Northern [[Arabia]].  The earliest known record of the connection of Abrahams son, Ishmael, to the Arabs is by the [[Jewish]] historian [[Josephus]], who approximately 2000 years after such events, asserted that Ishmael was the father of the &quot;Arab nation&quot; [http://www.blessedquietness.com/alhaj/append-1.htm].  Little other information exists to understand the basis for Josephus' statement or his understanding of what he meant by &quot;Arab nation&quot;, although one line in the [[Book of Jubilees]] (20:13) also mentions the tradition.

This has led to the notion of identifying Abraham as the father of the Arabs through Ishmael.  In addition, Abraham's next wife, [[Keturah]], is said to have borne him a son named [[Midian]] who became father of the [[Midianites]][http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/midian.htm].  The Midianites are also identified with the Arabs as they are said to have settled east of the [[Jordan River]][http://www.brow.on.ca/Books/Ishmael/Ishpost.htm]. In recent times some Christian polemical writers have insisted these claims are spurious and entirely made up by Muslims, although, they existed long before Islam arrived.  Some have claimed that all of Ishmael's descendants in fact died out; and that most Arabs are descended from Joktan.  The subject continues to be a source of controversy.

==Modern historical criticism==
Writers have regarded the life of Abraham in various ways. He has been viewed as a [[chieftain]] of the [[Amorites]], as the head of a great [[Semitic]] migration from [[Mesopotamia]]; or, since Ur and Haran were seats of [[Moon]]-worship, he has been identified with a moon-god.  From the character of the literary evidence and the locale of the stories it has been held that Abraham was originally associated with Hebron. The double name Abram/Abraham has even suggested that two personages have been combined in the Biblical narrative; although this does not explain the change from Sarai to Sarah. 

The narratives are not contemporary, and the interesting discovery of the name ''Abi-ramu'' (Abram) on Babylonian contracts of about [[2000 BC]] does not prove the Abram of the Old Testament to be an historical person, even as the fact that there were [[Amorites]] in Babylonia at the same period does not make it certain that the patriarch was one of their number.  One remarkable chapter associates Abraham with kings of [[Elam]] and the east (''Genesis'' 14). No longer a peaceful sheikh but a warrior with a small army of 318 followers, he overthrows a combination of powerful monarchs who have ravaged the land. The genuineness of the narrative has been strenuously maintained, although upon insufficient grounds.

On the assumption that a recollection of some invasion in remote days may have been current, considerable interest is attached to the names. Of these, [[Amraphel]], king of [[Shinar]] (i.e., Babylonia, ''Genesis'' 10:10), has been in the past identified with [[Hammurabi]], one of the greatest of the Babylonian kings (ca. 2000 BC), and since he claims to have ruled as far west as the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the equation has found considerable favour. Apart from chronological difficulties, the identification of the king and his country is far from certain, and at the most can only be regarded as possible. [[Arioch]], king of [[Ellasar]], has been connected with [[Eriaku of Larsa]] &amp;mdash; the reading has been questioned &amp;mdash; a contemporary with Hammurabi.  [[Chedorlaomer]], king of Elam, bears what is doubtless a genuine [[Elamite]] name, Kudur-Lagamer. Finally, the name of [[Tid'al]], king of [[Goiim]], may be identical with a certain [[Tudhulu]], the son of Gazza, a warrior, but apparently not a king, who is mentioned in a Babylonian inscription, and has been connected by others with [[Tudhaliya]], a predynastic Hittite king.  Goiim (the Hebrew for &quot;gentiles&quot; or &quot;nations&quot;) may also stand for Gutim, the [[Guti]] being a people who lived to the east of [[Kurdistan]]. Nevertheless, there is as yet no monumental evidence for the genuineness of the story, and the most that can be said with certainty is that the author (of whatever date) has derived his names from a trustworthy source, and in representing an invasion of Canaan by Babylonian overlords, has given expression to a possible situation. It may be that only the bare outlines are historical. If it is a historical romance (cf., e.g., the book of Judith), it is possible that a writer who lived in the [[post-exilic]] age, and was acquainted with Babylonian history, decided to enhance the greatness of Abraham by exhibiting his military success against the monarchs of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], the high esteem he enjoyed in Canaan, and the practical character displayed in his brief exchange with [[Melchizedek]]. The historical section of the article [[Tithe]] provides more evidence on the historicity of the meeting with Melchizedek.

Several minimalist professors of archaeology claim that many stories in the Old Testament, including important chronicles about Abraham, [[Moses]], and others, were actually made up by scribes hired by King [[Josiah]] ([[7th century BC]]) in order to rationalize monotheistic belief in Yahweh. Mimimalists claim that the neighboring countries that kept many written records, such as Egypt, Assyria, etc., have no writings about the stories of the Bible or its main characters before [[650 BC]], and vehemently dispute the validity of any evidence to the contrary. Such claims are detailed in &quot;Who Were the Early Israelites?&quot; by William G. Dever, (William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Grand Rapids, MI, 2003). Another such book by Neil A. Silberman and colleagues is &quot;The Bible Unearthed,&quot; (Simon and Schuster, New York, 2001). Of course, the historical annals and tributes to &quot;great kings&quot; are not well-served by preserving great defeats by their enemies (in this case, the Hebrews), and therefore, such records are understandably scanty. Also, many great kings did not long survive great defeats, as it was a sign to their followers that these &quot;great leaders&quot; had lost the favor of their God, gods and goddesses, and the kings were quickly assassinated and replaced.

[[image:Abraxas.png|frame|right|Engraving from an Abraxas stone.]]
The word '''Abraxas''' (or '''Abrasax''' or '''Abracax''') was engraved on certain antique stones, called on that account '''Abraxas stones''', which were used as amulets or charms by [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] sects. It was believed that Abraxas was the name of a god who incorporated both Good and Evil (God and [[Demiurge]]) in one entity, and therefore representing the [[monotheistic]] [[God]], singular, but (unlike e.g. the Christian God) not [[eutheism|omni-benevolent]]. Abraxas has been claimed to be both an [[Egypt]]ian god and a [[demon]], sometimes even being associated with the dual nature of [[Satan]]/[[Lucifer]].  This is possibly the origin of the word [[abracadabra]], although other explanations exist.

==Meaning==

:''&quot;The bird fights its way out of the egg. The egg is the world. Who would be born first must destroy a world. The bird flies to God. That God's name is Abraxas&quot;'' - [[Hermann Hesse]], ''[[Demian]]''
[[Image:Abraxas Artistic representationi.jpg|frame|left| Medieval Seal representing Abraxas]]
Abraxas was an [[Archon]] with a [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]-like appearance (somewhat resembling a [[basilisk]]): he had the head of a [[rooster]] (or sometimes a king), the body of a man, and legs fashioned like [[snake]]s and sometimes depicted with a whip in his hand - a form referred to as the [[Anguipede]]. Abraxas was redeemed and rose above the seven spheres and now reigns beyond the worlds. There are references to Abraxas in several gnostic writings.

The letters of abraxas, in the [[Greek language|Greek]] notation, make up the number 365, and the [[Basilideans]] gave the name to the 365 orders of spirits which, as they conceived, emanated in succession from the Supreme Being.  These orders were supposed to occupy 365 heavens, each fashioned like, but inferior to that above it; and the lowest of the heavens was thought to be the abode of the spirits who formed Earth and its inhabitants, and to whom was committed the administration of its affairs.  

In addition to the word Abraxas and other mystical characters, they have often cabalistic figures engraved on them.  The commonest of these have the head of a fowl, and the arms and bust of a man, and terminate in the body and tail of a serpent. 

===Text from the Catholic Encyclopedia===
The study of Abraxas is, at first sight, as discouraging as it is possible to imagine. The name has been given to a class of ancient stone articles, of small dimensions, inscribed with outlandish figures and formulas, sometimes wholly indecipherable, specimens of which are to be found in almost every museum and private collection. These, for the most part, have hitherto resisted all attempts at interpretation, though it would be rash to conclude that a fuller knowledge may not solve enigmas which remain closed to us. 

The true name, moreover, is Abrasax, and not, as incorrectly written, Abraxas, a reading due to the confusion made by the Latins between Sigma and Xi. Among the early Gnostics, Abrasax appears to have had various meanings. Basilides gave this title to Almighty God, and claimed that the [[isopsephy|numerical value of its letters]] gave the sum of 365, because the Abrasax is enclosed in the [[solar cycle (calendar)|solar cycle]]. Sometimes the number 365 signifies the series of the heavens. In view of such imaginings, it is easy to guess at the course taken by an untrammelled Gnostic fancy, whereby its adherents strove to discover the meaning of the mysterious word. 

It is, however, an error to give the name Abrasax to all stones of Gnostic origin, as has been done up to the present day. It is not the name which applies to talismans, any more than the names of Jupiter and Venus apply to all ancient statues indiscriminately. Abrasax is the name given by the Gnostics to the Supreme Deity, and it is quite possible that we shall find a clue to its etymological meaning in the influences of numbers. The subject is one which has exercised the ingenuity of many savants, but it may be said that all the engraved stones to which the name is commonly given fall into three classes: 
#Abrasax, or stones of Basilidian origin.
#Abrasaxtes, or stones originating in ancient forms of worship, and adapted by the Gnostics to their peculiar opinions.
#Abraxoïdes, or stones absolutely unconnected with the doctrine of Basilides. 

Bellermann, following Montfaucon, made a tentative classification of Gnostic stones, which, however, is nowadays looked upon as wholly inadequate. His mistake consisted in wishing, as it were, to make a frontal attack on Gnosticism. Kopp, endowed with greater skill and patience, seems to have realized in some measure how wide the problem actually is. Ad. Franck and, quite lately, Moses Schwab have made diligent researches in the direction of the [[Cabbala]] (or Kabbala). &quot;The demonology devised by the Cabbalists&quot;; according to the former writer, &quot;was nothing more than a carefully thought out personification of the different degrees of life and intelligence which they perceived in external nature. All natural growths, forces, and phenomena are thus typified.&quot; The outline here furnished needs only to be extended indefinitely in order to take in quite easily the countless generations of Gnosticism. The whole moral and physical world, analyzed and classified with an inconceivable minuteness, will find place in it. Thence, also, will issue the bewildering catalogues of Gnostic personalities. 

The chief difficulty, however, arises from the nomenclature of Gnosticism, and here the &quot;Sepher Raziel&quot; supplies a first and valuable hint. &quot;To succeed in the operations of divination&quot;, it says, &quot;it is necessary to pronounce the mystic names of the planets or of the earth.&quot; In fact, stones of Gnostic origin often show designs made up out of the initial letters of the planets. Another parallel is still more suggestive. The [[Jew]]s, as is well known, would never pronounce the Ineffable Name, [[Jehovah]], but substituted either another name or a paraphrase; a rule which applied, not only to the Ineffable Name and its derivatives, but to others as well, ending, in order to evade the difficulty which arose, in a series of fantastic sounds which at first seem simply the outcome of a hopeless confusion. It became necessary to resort to permutations, to the use of other letters, to numerical and formal equivalents. The result was an outlandish vocabulary, only partially accounted for, yet one which nevertheless reveals in Gnosticism the existence of something more than mere incoherences. Very many secrets of Gnosticism remain unexplained, but it may be hoped that they will not always be shrouded in mystery.

====Tertullian :====

'Afterwards broke out the heretic Basilides. He affirms that there is a supreme Deity, by name Abraxas, by whom was created Mind, which in Greek he calls Nous; that thence sprang the Word; that of Him issued Providence, Virtue, and Wisdom; that out of these subsequently were made Principalities, powers, and Angels; that there ensued infinite issues and processions of angels; that by these angels 365 heavens were formed, and the world, in honour of Abraxas, whose name, if computed, has in itself this number. Now, among the last of the angels, those who made this world, he places the God of the Jews latest, that is, the God of the Law and of the Prophets, whom he denies to be a God, but affirms to be an angel. To him, he says, was allotted the seed of Abraham, and accordingly he it was who transferred the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt into the land of Canaan; affirming him to be turbulent above the other angels, and accordingly given to the frequent arousing of seditions and wars, yes, and the shedding of human blood. Christ, moreover, he affirms to have been sent, not by this maker of the world, but by the above-named Abraxas; and to have come in a phantasm, and been destitute of the substance of flesh: that it was not He who suffered among the Jews, but that Simon was crucified in His stead: whence, again, there must be no believing on him who was crucified, lest one confess to having believed on Simon. Martyrdoms, he says, are not to be endured. The resurrection of the flesh he strenuously impugns, affirming that salvation has not been promised to bodies.'

 

====Carl Jung :  The Seven Sermons to the Dead====

&quot;Abraxas speaketh that hallowed and accursed word which is life and death at the same time. Abraxas begetteth truth and lying, good and evil, light and darkness in the same word and in the same act. Wherefore is Abraxas terrible.&quot;

 

====E. A. Wallis Budge : ====

&quot;Abrasax represented the 365 Aeons or emanations from the First Cause, and as a Pantheus, i.e. All-God, he appears on the amulets with the head of a cock (Phoebus) or of a lion (Ra or Mithras), the body of a man, and his legs are serpents which terminate in scorpions, types of the Agathodaimon. In his right hand he grasps a club, or a flail, and in his left is a round or oval shield”

[[Image:Absalom.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Hanging of Absalom - Weft-silk watercolor by Faith Robinson Trumbull (1718-1780)]]

'''Absalom''' or '''Avshalom''' ('''&amp;#1488;&amp;#1463;&amp;#1489;&amp;#1456;&amp;#1513;&amp;#1473;&amp;#1464;&amp;#1500;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1465;&amp;#1501;''' &quot;Father/Leader of/is peace&quot;, [[Standard Hebrew]] '''Av&amp;#X161;alom''', [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''&amp;#702;A&amp;#7687;&amp;#X161;&amp;#257;lôm'''), in the 
[[Bible]], is the third son of [[David]], king of [[kingdom of Israel|Israel]].  He was deemed 
the handsomest man in the kingdom.  

His sister [[Tamar (biblical figure)|Tamar]] had 
been raped by David's eldest son, [[Amnon]], who was in love with her.  Absalom, after waiting two years, revenged by sending his servants to murder Amnon at a feast to which he had invited all the king's sons (2 [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] 13):

&quot;18. ''And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.''

19. ''And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying''.

20. ''And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house''....

22. ''And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.''

23. ''And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.''

28. ''Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.''&quot;


After this deed he fled to Talmai, &quot;king&quot; of [[Geshur]] (see Joshua 12:5 or 13:2), his maternal grandfather, and it was not until three years later that he was fully reinstated in his father's favour (see [[Joab]].) 

Four years after this he raised a revolt at [[Hebron]], the former capital.  Absalom was now the eldest surviving son of David, and the present position of the narratives (15-20)--after the birth of [[Solomon]] and before the struggle between Solomon and Adonijah---may represent the view that the suspicion that he was not the destined heir of his father's throne excited the impulsive youth to 
rebellion.  

All Israel and Judah flocked to his side, and David, attended only by the [[Cherethites]] and [[Pelethites]] and some recent recruits from Gath, found it expedient to flee.  
The priests remained behind in Jerusalem, and their sons Jonathan and Ahimaaz served as his spies.  Absalom reached the capital and took counsel with the renowned [[Ahithophel]].  
The pursuit was continued and David took refuge beyond the [[Jordan River]].  

A battle was fought in the &quot;wood of Ephraim&quot; (the name suggests a locality west of the Jordan) and Absalom's army was completely routed.  He himself, having long hair, was caught by his hair in the boughs of an oak-tree, and as David had strictly charged his men to deal gently with the young man, Joab was informed.  
What a common soldier refused to do even for a thousand shekels of silver, the king's general at once undertook.  
Joab thrust three spears through the heart of Absalom as he struggled in the branches and his ten armour-bearers came around and slew him.  
Despite the revolt, David was overwhelmed with [[grief]] and ordered a great heap of stones to be erected where he fell, whilst another monument near [[Jerusalem]] (not the modern &quot;Absalom Tomb&quot; - &quot;[[Yad Avshalom]]&quot; which is of later origin was erected by Avshalom in his lifetime to perpetuate his name 2 Samuel 18:

&quot;18. ''Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a monument, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's monument''.&quot;

      <comment>disambiguation from [[Coptic]] to [[Coptic Christianity]] - ([[WP:DPL|You can help!]])</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Hiero|1=Abydos|2=&lt;hiero&gt;Ab-b-Dw:O49&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
'''Abydos''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: أبيدوس), one of the most ancient cities of [[Upper and Lower Egypt|Upper Egypt]], stood about 11 km (6 miles) west of the [[Nile]] at latitude 26° 10' N. The [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name was Abdju (technically, ''3b&lt;u&gt;d&lt;/u&gt;w'', hieroglyphs shown to the right), &quot;the hill of the symbol or reliquary,&quot; in which the sacred head of [[Osiris]] was preserved. Thence the Greeks named it Abydos, like the city on the [[Hellespont]]; the modern [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name is [[el-'Araba el Madfuna]] ({{lang-ar|العربة المدفنة}} ''al-ʿarabä al-madfanä''). 

==History ==
The history of the city begins in the late prehistoric age, it having been founded by the rulers of the [[Predynastic Period of Egypt|Predynastic period]] ([[William Flinders Petrie]], ''Abydos'', ii. 64), whose town, temple and tombs have been found there. The kings of the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]], and some of the second dynasty, were also buried here, and the temple was renewed and enlarged by them. Great forts were built on the desert behind the town by three kings of the [[Second dynasty of Egypt|Second dynasty]]. The temple and town continued to be rebuilt at intervals down to the times of the [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|30th dynasty]], and the cemetery was used continuously. In the [[twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th dynasty]] a gigantic tomb was cut in the rock by [[Senusret III]]. [[Seti I]], in the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]], founded a great new temple to the south of the town in honour of the ancestral kings of the early dynasties; this was finished by [[Ramesses II]], who also built a lesser temple of his own. [[Merneptah]] added a great [[Hypogeum]] of Osiris to the temple of Seti. The latest building was a new temple of [[Nectanebo I]] in the 30th dynasty. From [[Ptolemaic Period|Ptolemaic]] times the place continued to decay and no later works are known (Petrie, ''Abydos'', i. and ii.). 

==Worship ==
The worship here was of the jackal god [[Upuaut]] (Ophols, Wepwoi), who &quot;opened the way&quot; to the realm of the dead, increasing from the first dynasty to the time of the 12th dynasty and then disappearing after the 18th. [[Anhur]] appears in the eleventh dynasty; and [[Anubis]], the god of the western Hades, rises to importance in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and then vanishes in the 18th. The worship here of [[Osiris]] in his various forms begins in the 12th dynasty and becomes more important in later times, so that at last the whole place was considered as sacred to him (''Abydos'', ii. 47).

==Temples built==
The temples successively built here on one site were nine or ten in number, from the 1st dynasty to the [[twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th dynasty]]. The first was an enclosure, about 30 x 50 ft., surrounded by a thin wall of unbaked bricks.  Covering one wall of this came the second temple of about 40 ft. square in a wall about 10 ft. thick. An outer ''temenos'' (enclosure) wall surrounded the ground. This outer wall was thickened about the 2nd or [[Third dynasty of Egypt|3rd dynasty]].  The old temple entirely vanished in the 4th dynasty, and a smaller building was erected behind it, enclosing a wide hearth of black ashes.  
Pottery models of offerings are found in the ashes, and these were probably the substitutes for sacrifices decreed by [[Khufu (pharaoh)|Khufu]] (or Cheops) in his temple reforms.  

A great clearance of temple offerings was made now, or earlier, and a chamber full of them has yielded the fine ivory carvings and the glazed figures and tiles which show the splendid work of the 1st dynasty. A vase of [[Menes]] with purple inlaid [[hieroglyphs]] in green glaze and the tiles with relief figures are the most important pieces. The noble statuette of Cheops in ivory, found in the stone chamber of the temple, gives the only portrait of this greatest ruler.  

The temple was rebuilt entirely on a larger scale by [[Pepi I Meryre|Pepi I]] in the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|6th dynasty]].  He placed a great stone gateway to the temenos, an outer temenos wall and gateway, with a colonnade between the gates. His temple was about 40 x 50 ft. inside, with stone gateways front and back, showing that it was of the processional type. In the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|11th dynasty]] [[Mentuhotep I]] added a colonnade and altars. Soon after, [[Mentuhotep II]] entirely rebuilt the temple, laying a stone pavement over the area, about 45 feet square, besides subsidiary chambers. Soon after [[Senusret I]] in the 12th dynasty laid massive foundations of stone over the pavement of his predecessor. A great temenos was laid out enclosing a much larger area, and the temple itself was about three times the earlier size. 

==18th dynasty==
The [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] began with a large chapel of [[Ahmose]], and then [[Thutmose III]] built a far larger temple, about 130 x 200 ft. He made also a processional way past the side of the temple to the cemetery beyond, with a great gateway of granite. [[Rameses III]] added a large building; and [[Ahmose II]] in the 26th dynasty rebuilt the temple again, and placed in it a large monolith shrine of red granite, finely wrought. The foundations of the successive temples were comprised within about 18 ft. depth of ruins; these needed the closest examination to discriminate the various buildings, and were recorded by over 4000 measurements and 1000 levellings (Petrie, ''Abydos'', ii.). 

==Other temples==
The temple of Seti I was built on entirely new ground half a mile to the south of the long series of temples just described. This is the building best known as the Great Temple of Abydos, being nearly complete and an impressive sight. A principal object of it was the adoration of the early kings, whose cemetery, to which it forms a great funerary chapel, lies behind it. The long list of the kings of the principal dynasties carved on a wall is known as the &quot;[[Table of Abydos]]&quot;. There were also seven chapels for the worship of the king and principal gods.  At the back were large chambers connected with the Osiris worship (Caulfield, ''Temple of the Kings''); and probably from these led out the great Hypogeum for the celebration of the Osiris mysteries, built by Mineptah (Murray, ''Osireion''). The temple was originally 550 ft. long, but the forecourts are scarcely recognizable, and the part in good state is about 250 ft. long and 350 ft. wide, including the wing at the side.  

Excepting the list of kings and a [[panegyric]] on Ramesses II, the subjects are not historical but mythological. The work is celebrated for its delicacy and refinement, but lacks the life and character of that in earlier ages. The sculptures have been mostly published in hand copy, not facsimile, by [[Auguste Mariette]] in his ''Abydos'', i.  The adjacent temple of Rameses II was much smaller and simpler in plan; but it had a fine historical series of scenes around the outside, of which the lower parts remain. A list of kings, similar to that of Seti I, formerly stood here; but the fragments were removed by the French consul and sold to the [[British Museum]].

== Tombs==
The Royal Tombs of the earliest dynasties were placed about a mile back on the great desert plain, in a place now known as [[Umm el-Qa'ab]].  The earliest is about 10 x 20ft. inside, a pit lined with brick walls, and originally roofed with timber and matting. Others also before Menes are 15 x 25 ft. The tomb probably of Menes is of the latter size. After this the tombs increase in size and complexity. The [[tomb-pit]] is surrounded by chambers to hold the offerings, the actual [[sepulchre]] being a great wooden chamber in the midst of the brick-lined pit. Rows of small tomb-pits for the servants of the king surround the royal chamber, many dozens of such burials being usual.  

By the end of the 2nd dynasty the type changed to a long passage bordered with chambers on either hand, the royal burial being in the middle of the length. The greatest of these tombs with its dependencies covered a space of over 3000 square yards (2,500 m&amp;sup2;). The contents of the tombs have been nearly destroyed by successive plunderers; enough remained to show that rich jewellery was placed on the mummies, a profusion of vases of hard and valuable stones from the royal table service stood about the body, the store-rooms were filled with great jars of wine, perfumed ointment and other supplies, and tablets of ivory and of ebony were engraved with a record of the yearly annals of the reigns. The sealings of the various officials, of which over 200 varieties have been found, give an insight into the public arrangements (Petrie, ''Royal Tombs'', i. and ii.). 

The cemetery of private persons begins in the 1st dynasty with some pit-tombs in the town.  It was extensive in the 12th and 13th dynasties and contained many rich tombs. A large number of fine tombs were made in the 18th to 20th dynasties, and later ages continued to bury here till Roman times. Many hundred funeral steles were removed by Mariette's workmen, without any record of the burials (Mariette, ''Abydos'', ii. and iii.). Later excavations have been recorded by [[Ayrton]], Abydos, iii.; [[Maclver]], ''El Amrah and Abydos''; and [[Garstang]], ''El Arabah''.

==&quot;Forts&quot;==
The structures referred to as &quot;forts&quot; lay behind the town. Known as [[Shunet ez Zebib]] is about 450 x 250 ft. over all, and still stands 30 ft. high. It was built by [[Khasekhemwy]], the last king of the 2nd dynasty. Another nearly as large adjoined it, and is probably rather older. A third fort of a squarer form is now occupied by the [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic]] convent; its age cannot be ascertained (Ayrton, Abydos, iii.).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abu al-Fida''' (fully '''Abu Al-fida' Isma'il Ibn 'ali Al-malik Al-mu'ayyad 'imad Ad-din''', also [[transliterated]] '''Abulfeda''', '''Abu Alfida''', and other ways) (November [[1273]] &amp;ndash; [[October 27]], [[1331]]) was an [[Arab]] [[historian]], [[geographer]], and local [[sultan]].

==Life==

Abulfeda was born at [[Damascus]], where his father [[Malik ul-Afdal]], brother of the prince of [[Hamah]], had fled from the [[Mongols]]. He was a descendant of [[Ayyub]], the father of [[Saladin]].  

In his boyhood he devoted himself to the study of the ''[[Qur'an]]'' and the sciences, but from his twelfth year was almost constantly engaged in military expeditions, chiefly against the [[Crusades|crusaders]].  

In [[1285]] he was present at the assault of a stronghold of the [[Knights of St. John]], and took part in the sieges of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], [[Akko|Acre]] and [[Qal'at ar-Rum]]. In [[1298]] he entered the service of the [[Mameluke]] [[Sultan]] [[Malik al-Nasir]] and after twelve years was invested by him with the governorship of [[Hamah]]. In [[1312]] he became prince with the title '''Malik us-Salhn''', and in [[1320]] 
received the hereditary rank of ''sultan'' with the title '''Malik ul-Mu'ayyad'''.  

For more than twenty years all together he reigned in tranquillity and splendour, devoting himself to the duties of government and to the composition of the works to which he is chiefly indebted for his fame. He was a munificent patron of men of letters, who came in large numbers to his court. He died in [[1331]].

==Works==

His chief historical work is ''An Abridgment of the History at the Human Race,'' in the form of [[annals]] extending from the creation of the world to the year [[1329]] ([[Constantinople]], 2 vols. [[1869]]).  

His geography is, like much of the history, founded on the works of his predecessors, and so ultimately on the work of [[Ptolemy]]. A long introduction on various geographical matters is followed by twenty-eight sections dealing in tabular form with the chief towns of the world. After each name are given the longitude, latitude, climate, spelling, and then observations generally taken from earlier authors.  

Parts of the work were published and translated as early as [[1650]] in [[Europe]].

'''''Acacia''''' is a genus of [[shrub]]s and [[tree]]s of [[Gondwana|Gondwanian]] origin belonging to the Subfamily [[Mimosoideae]] of the Pea Family (Family [[Fabaceae]]), first described from Africa by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in [[1773]]. There are roughly 1300 species of ''Acacia'' worldwide, about 950 of them native to [[Australia]], with the remainder spread around the dry tropical to warm-temperate regions of both hemispheres, including Africa, southern Asia, and the Americas. The Genus ''Acacia'' however is apparently not [[monophyletic]]. This discovery has led to the breaking up of ''Acacia'' into five new genera as discussed in [[List of Acacia species]].

The northernmost species in the genus is ''Acacia greggii'' ([[Catclaw Acacia]]), reaching 37°10' N in southern [[Utah]] in the [[United States]]; the southernmost are ''Acacia dealbata'' ([[Silver Wattle]]), ''Acacia longifolia'' ([[Coast Wattle]] or Sydney Golden Wattle), ''Acacia mearnsii'' ([[Black Wattle]]), and ''Acacia melanoxylon'' ([[Acacia melanoxylon|Blackwood]]), reaching 43°30' S in [[Tasmania]], Australia, while ''Acacia caven'' ([[Espinillo Negro]]) reaches nearly as far south in northeastern [[Chubut Province]] of [[Argentina]]. Australian species are usually called '''[[wattle]]s''', while African and American species tend to be known as '''acacias'''.

The leaves of acacias are compound pinnate in general. In some species, however, more especially in the Australian and Pacific islands species, the leaflets are suppressed, and the leaf-stalks ('''[[petiole]]s''') become vertically flattened, and serve the purpose of leaves; these are known as '''[[phyllode]]s'''. The vertical orientation of the phyllodes protects them from intense sunlight, as with their edges towards the sky and earth they do not intercept light so fully as horizontally placed leaves. A few species (such as ''[[Acacia glaucoptera]]'') lack leaves or phyllodes altogether, but possess instead '''[[cladode]]s''', modified leaf-like photosynthetic stems functioning as leaves.

The small [[flower]]s have five, very small petals, almost hidden by the long stamens, and are arranged in dense globular or cylindrical clusters; they are yellow or cream-colored in most species, whitish in some, even purple (as in ''[[Acacia purpureapetala]]'') or red (in the recently grown cultivar ''[[Acacia leprosa]] 'Scarlet Blaze''').

The plants often bear spines, especially those species growing in arid regions. These sometimes represent branches which have become short, hard and pungent, or sometimes leaf-stipules. ''Acacia armata'' is the [[Kangaroo-thorn]] of Australia, ''Acacia giraffae'', the [[Camelthorn]] of Africa. In the Central American ''Acacia sphaerocephala'' ([[Bullthorn Acacia]]) and ''[[Acacia spadicigera]]'', the large thorn-like stipules are hollow and afford shelter for [[ant]]s, which feed on a secretion of honey on the leaf-stalk and curious food-bodies at the tips of the leaflets; in return they protect the plant against leaf-eating insects.

In common parlance the term &quot;acacia&quot; is occasionally misapplied to species of the Genus ''Robinia'', which also belongs in the pea family.  ''Robinia pseudoacacia'', an American species locally known as [[Black locust]], is sometimes called &quot;false acacia&quot; in cultivation in Britain.

In Australia, ''Acacia'' species are sometimes used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of [[Hepialidae|hepialid]] [[moth]]s of the genus ''[[Aenetus]]'' including ''A. ligniveren''. These burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down. Other [[Lepidoptera]] larvae which have been recorded feeding on ''Acacia'' include [[Brown-tail]], ''[[Endoclita|Endoclita malabaricus]]'' and [[Turnip Moth]]. The leaf-mining larvae of some [[Bucculatricidae|bucculatricid]] moths also feed on ''Acacia'': ''Bucculatrix agilis'' feeds exclusively on ''Acacia horrida'', ''Bucculatrix flexuosa'' feeds exclusively on ''Acacia nilotica''.

== Uses ==
[[Image:Acaciaauriculiformis1web.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Earpod Wattle (''Acacia auriculiformis'')]]

===Industrial and medicinal uses===
Various species of acacia yield gum.  True [[gum arabic]] is the product of ''[[Acacia senegal]]'', abundant in dry tropical west Africa from [[Senegal]] to northern [[Nigeria]]. 

''[[Acacia arabica]]'' is the gum-arabic tree of India, but yields a gum inferior to the true gum-arabic. The bark of ''Acacia arabica'', under the name of '''babul''' or '''babool''', is used in Scinde for tanning. In [[Ayurvedic medicine]], babul is considered a remedy that is helpful for treating premature ejaculation.

The bark of various Australian species, known as wattles, is very rich in tannin and forms an important article of export; important species include ''Acacia pycnantha'' (Golden Wattle), ''Acacia decurrens'' (Tan Wattle), ''Acacia dealbata'' (Silver Wattle) and ''Acacia mearnsii'' (Black Wattle). Black Wattle is grown in  plantations in South Africa.  The pods of ''[[Acacia nilotica]]'' (under the name of neb-neb), and of other African species are also rich in tannin and used by tanners.

Some species afford valuable timber; such are ''Acacia melanoxylon'' (Blackwood) from [[Australia]], which attains a great size; its wood is used for furniture, and takes a high polish; and ''Acacia homalophylla'' ([[Myall Wood]], also Australian), which yields a fragrant timber, used for ornamental purposes. ''[[Acacia formosa]]'' supplies the valuable [[Cuba]]n timber called sabicu. ''[[Acacia seyal]]'' is thought to be the shittah tree of the [[Bible]], which supplied shittim-wood. This was used in the construction of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. As a spiritual icon it is also one of the most powerful symbols in [[freemasonry]], representing the eternal soul and purity of the soul. ''[[Acacia heterophylla]]'' from [[Réunion]] island, and ''[[Koa|Acacia koa]]'' from the [[Hawaiian Islands]] are excellent timber trees.

''Acacia farnesiana'' is used in the perfume industry due to its strong fragrance.

An astringent medicine, called [[catechu]] or cutch, is procured from several species, but more especially from ''[[Acacia catechu]]'', by boiling down the wood and evaporating the solution so as to get an extract.

===Ornamental uses===
A few species are widely grown as ornamentals in [[garden]]s; the most popular perhaps is ''Acacia dealbata'' (Silver Wattle), with its attractive glaucous to silvery leaves and bright yellow flowers; it is erroneously known as &quot;mimosa&quot; in some areas where it is cultivated, through confusion with the related genus ''[[Mimosa]]''.

===Culinary uses===
[[Acacia seed]]s are often used for food and a variety of other products. The seeds of ''[[Acacia niopo]]'', for instance, are roasted and used as [[snuff]] in [[South America]]. 

In [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]], the feathery shoots of ''[[Acacia pennata]]'' (common name ''cha-om'') are used in soups, curries, omelettes, and stir-fries.

===Pharmacological uses===
Many Acacia species contain some psychoactive alkaloids of which [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[N-methyltryptamine|NMT]] are the most prominent and useful. The leaves, stems and/or roots can be made into a brew together with some [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOI]]-containing plant to obtain an effect when taken orally. This could be seen as a kind of ''[[Ayahuasca]]''. Maybe in relation to this effect, [[Egyptian mythology]] has associated the acacia tree with characteristics of the [[tree of life]] (cf. article on the [[Legend of Osiris and Isis]]). 

Alkaloids in different species, from ''[[TiHKAL]]'' (by [[Alexander Shulgin]]):
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''A. baileyana''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.02% tryptamine and &amp;beta;-carbolines, in the leaf&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''A. maidenii''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DMT and NMT, in the stem bark&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''A. albida''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DMT, in the leaf&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">: ''This article is about the city in Mexico; there is also a town called [[Acapulco, Peru|Acapulco]] in Peru.''
'''Acapulco''' (Officially: '''Acapulco de Juárez''') is a city and major [[sea port]] in the state of [[Guerrero]] on the Pacific coast of [[Mexico]], 300 km (190 miles) southwest from [[Mexico City]], at {{coor d|16.85|N|99.92|W|}}. Acapulco is located on a deep, semi-circular bay. Many consider it to be one of the best harbours on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of Mexico, and it is a port of call for shipping lines running between [[Panama]] and [[San Francisco, California]], [[United States|USA]]. In [[2003]] the estimated population was 638,000 people. [[Image:spring break.jpg||thumb|280px|right|Acapulco Beach]]
[[Image:JLNYCAcapulcoBay.jpg|thumb|right|Acapulco]] 

==Geography==
The town is built on a narrow strip of low land, scarcely half a mile wide, between the shore line and the lofty mountains that encircle the bay.  There is great natural beauty in the surroundings, mountains render the access to the town, though not difficult to access particularly since the construction of a 2-km-long tunnel to the waterfront from the hinterland in the [[1990s]].  An earlier effort to admit the cooling sea breezes by cutting through the mountains a passage called the Abra de San Nicolas had some beneficial effect.  

==History== 
Acapulco has been well known as a traveler's crossroads for at least a millennium. Its name is a [[Nahuatl]] word, meaning &quot;plain of dense reeds.&quot;

The earliest local remains, stone metates and pottery utensils, were left in the [[3rd millennium BC]].  Much later, sophisticated artisans fashioned curvaceous female figurines.  Some hypothesize that there was early Polynesian or Asian influences in Pacific Mexico as early as 1500 years before the arrival [[Christopher Columbus]].

Other artifacts resemble those found in highland Mexico.  Although influenced by [[Tarascan]], [[Mixtec]], [[Zapotec]], and [[Aztec]] civilizations, sometimes paying tribute to them and frequented by their traders, Acapulco never came under their direct control, but instead remained subject to local caciques until the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest.
[[Image:Puerto_de_Acapulco_Boot_1628.png|right|thumb|A 1628 Spanish relief map of Acapulco Bay]]
After conquering the Aztecs, [[Hernán Cortés]] sent expeditions south to build ships and find a route to [[China]]. The first explorers sailed from [[Zacatula]], near present-day [[Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán]], on the coast 400 km (250 miles) north-west of Acapulco.  By a royal decree dated [[April 25]], [[1528]], &quot;Acapulco and her land ... where the ships of the south will be built....&quot; passed directly into the hands of the Spanish Crown.  Voyages of discovery set sail from Acapulco for [[Peru]], the [[Sea of Cortez]], and to [[Asia]].  None returned across the Pacific, however, until Augustinian priest [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] discovered the northern Pacific tradewinds, which propelled him and his ship, loaded with Chinese treasure, to Acapulco in [[1565]].

For more than 200 years after that, a special yearly trading ship, known to the English as the [[Manila Galleon]], set sail from Acapulco for the [[Manila]] and the Orient. Its return started an annual merchant fair in Acapulco where traders bargained for the Galleon's cargo of silks, porcelain, ivory, and lacquerware.  This trade connection, which persisted up to Mexican independence, was instrumental in placing the [[Philippines]] on the east side of the [[International Date Line]] until the end of [[1844]].

Acapulco's yearly treasure soon attracted marauders, too.  In [[1579]], [[Francis Drake]] attacked but failed to capture the Galleon, but in [[1587]], off [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[Thomas Cavendish]] seized the ''Santa Anna''.  The cash alone, 1.2 million [[gold]] pesos, severely depressed the [[London bullion market]].

After a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] fleet invaded Acapulco in [[1615]], the Spanish rebuilt their fort, which they christened ''Fort San Diego'' in [[1617]].  Destroyed by an [[earthquake]] in [[1776]], the fort was rebuilt by 1783.  The [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]] ([[1820]]-[[1821|21]]) stopped the Manila Galleon forever, sending Acapulco into a century-long slumber.

The town suffered considerably from [[earthquake]]s in July and August [[1909]].  

[[Miguel Aleman Valdes]] was the [[President of Mexico]] who put so much in the modernization and development of Acapulco. He did so much not only as President but also as the Head of Mexico's National Tourist Commission after he left office. 

Acapulco was devastated by [[Hurricane Pauline]] in [[October]] [[1997]].

==Economy==
There are exports of hides, [[wood]], and fruit, and the adjacent district of [[Tabares]] produces [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], [[cacao]], [[sugarcane]], Indian corn, beans, and [[coffee]].

==Acapulco as a holiday resort==
[[Image:Acapulco.jpg|thumb|right|View of the Pacific Ocean from an Acapulco hotel]]

For many years Acapulco has been a popular resort for holiday makers. The city has had its star-spangled times, prompting none other than Old Blue Eyes [[Frank Sinatra]] to give the place a mention in his all time classic [[Come Fly With Me]]. Modern Acapulco still has a great appeal. The vast majority of the tourists now tend to come from the rest of Mexico but several other foreign nationals make appearances in the numerous bars and clubs dotted around the bay come sun down. 

In recent years, Acapulco has made some ground on [[Cancún]] for Spring Break's most popular resort destinations. Acapulco offers a relatively unknown experience and a larger international student crowd than Cancún. Due to a recent gun fight between drugdealers and police that left 4 drug dealers dead, the town has feared it might affect tourism this spring break.[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5228258][http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?cid=784788][http://www.el-universal.com.mx/notas/327982.html][http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/01/28/003n1pol.php][http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?idc=223266]

==Transportation==
By the early [[20th century]], the town was chosen as the terminus for two railway lines seeking a Pacific port &amp;ndash; the Interoceanic and the Mexican Central.  The port city grew greatly in the 20th century.

Acapulco is served by [[General Juan N. Álvarez International Airport]].

      <comment>/* Name and etymology */ Mons Garganus -&gt; Monte Gargano</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Adriatic Sea.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The Adriatic Sea&lt;br&gt;''Source:'' [[NASA]]]]

The '''Adriatic Sea''' is an arm of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] separating the [[Italian peninsula]] from the [[Balkan peninsula]], and the system of the [[Apennine Mountains]] from that of the [[Dinaric Alps]] and adjacent ranges.

The western coast is [[Italy|Italian]], while the eastern coast runs along the countries of [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]], and [[Albania]].

==Name and etymology==
[[Image:Adriatic Sea map.png|thumb|right|Map of the Adriatic Sea]]

The name has existed since the antiquity; in [[Latin]] it was ''Mare Hadriaticum''. The name, derived from the town of [[Adria]] (or ''Hadria''), belonged originally only to the upper portion of the sea (Herodotus vi. 127, vii. 20, ix. 92; Euripides, ''Hippolytus,'' 736), but was gradually extended as the [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusan]] colonies gained in importance.

But even then the Adriatic in the narrower sense only extended as far as the [[Monte Gargano]], the outer portion being called the [[Ionian Sea]]:
the name was sometimes, however, inaccurately used to include the Gulf of Tarentum (the modern-day [[Gulf of Taranto]]), the [[Sea of Sicily]], the [[Gulf of Corinth]] and even the sea between [[Crete]] and [[Malta]] (Acts xxvii. 27).

The Adriatic Sea is east of Italy, a major tourist attraction. It was used by the ancient Romans to transport objects (including animals and [[slaves]]) to Ostia (the Roman port). These objects were used in various places in Rome.

==Extent==
The Adriatic extends northwest from 40° to 45° 45' N., with an extreme length of about 770 km (415 [[nautical mile|nm]], 480 [[mile|mi]]). It has a [[arithmetic mean|mean]] breadth of about 160 km (85 [[nautical mile|nm]], 100 [[mile|mi]]), although the [[Strait of Otranto]], through which it connects at the south with the Ionian Sea, is only 45-55 [[nautical mile]]s wide (85-100 km).

Moreover, the chain of islands which fringes the northern part of the eastern shore reduces the extreme breadth of open sea in this part to 145 km (78 nm, 90 mi). Its total surface area is about 60,000 square miles ([[1 E11 m²|160,000]] [[square kilometre|km²]]).

The northern part of the sea is very shallow, and between the southern promontories of [[Istria]] and [[Rimini]] the depth rarely exceeds 46 m (25 [[fathom]]s). Between [[Sibenik|Šibenik]] and [[Ortona]] a well-marked depression occurs, a considerable area of which exceeds 180 m (100 fathoms) in depth.

From a point between [[Korcula|Korčula]] and the north shore of the spur of [[Monte Gargano]] there is a ridge giving shallower water, and a broken chain of a few islets extends across the sea.

The deepest part of the sea lies east of Monte Gargano, south of Dubrovnik, and west of [[Durrës]] where a large basin gives depths of 900 m (500 fathoms) and upwards, and a small area in the south of this basin falls below 1,460 m (800 fathoms). 
The mean depth of the sea is estimated at 240 m (133 fathoms).

==Coasts and islands==
The west shore is generally low, merging, in the northwest, into the marshes and lagoons on either hand of the protruding delta of the river [[Po river|Po]], the [[sediment]] of which has pushed forward the coastline for several miles within historic times — Adria is now some distance from the shore.

On islands within one of the lagoons opening from the [[Gulf of Venice]], [[Venice]] has its unique situation. Other notable cities on the Italian coast are [[Trieste]], [[Ravenna]], [[Rimini]], [[Ancona]], [[Pescara]], [[Bari]] and [[Brindisi]]. 

The east coast is generally bold and rocky, with many islands. South of the [[Istria|Istrian Peninsula]], which separates the Gulfs of Venice and [[Gulf of Trieste]] from the [[Bay of Kvarner]], the island-fringe of the east coast extends as far south as [[Dubrovnik]].

The islands, which are long and narrow (the long axis lying parallel with the coast of the mainland), rise rather abruptly to elevations of a few hundred feet, with the exception of a few larger islands like [[Brač]] (Vidova gora, 778 m) or the peninsula [[Pelješac]] (St. Ilija, 961 m). There are over a thousand islands in the Adriatic, 66 of which are inhabited.

On the mainland, notably in the magnificent inlet of the [[Gulf of Kotor]] (Boka Kotorska, Bocche di Cattaro; named after the town of [[Kotor]]), lofty mountains often fall directly to the sea.

The prevalent colour of the rocks is a light, dead grey, contrasting harshly with the dark vegetation, which on some of the islands is luxuriant. In fact, [[Montenegro]] (Black Mountain) was named after the [[European black pine|black pines]] that cover the coast there, and similarly the Greek name for the island of [[Korčula]] is ''Korkyra Melaina'' meaning &quot;Black Corfu&quot;.

Major cities on the northeastern coast include [[Trieste]] in Italy; [[Izola]], [[Koper]], [[Piran]] and [[Portorož]] in Slovenia; [[Pula]], [[Rovinj]], [[Poreč]], [[Rijeka]], [[Zadar]], [[Šibenik]], [[Trogir]], [[Split]], [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia; [[Herceg Novi]], [[Bar, Serbia and Montenegro|Bar]], [[Ulcinj]] in Montenegro; and [[Durrës]] in Albania.

==Miscellaneous==
The [[bora|''bora'' or ''bura'']] (northeast wind), and the prevalence of sudden squalls from this quarter or the southeast, are dangers to navigation in winter. Also notable are [[sirocco|''sirocco'' or ''jugo'']] (southern wind) which brings rain in the winter and ''[[maestral]]'' (western wind) which brings nice weather in the summer.

Tidal movement is slight. The [[amphidromic point]] is just off the northwestern shore, near Ancona.

Both coasts are popular [[tourism|tourist]] destinations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Alan-Kay.jpg|thumb|right|Alan Kay during an interview.]]
'''Alan Kay''', born [[May 17]], [[1940]], is an [[United States|American]] [[computer scientist]], known for his early work on [[object-oriented programming]] and user interface design.
Until [http://blogs.siliconvalley.com/gmsv/2005/07/hewlettpackards.html recently] he was a Senior Fellow at [[HP Labs]], an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], a Visiting Professor at [[Kyoto University]], and an Adjunct Professor at [[MIT]]. He is also the president of the [[Viewpoints Research Institute]].

== Early life and work ==
Originally from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], Kay earned a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Mathematics and Molecular Biology from the [[University of Colorado]], and another [[Master's degree]] and Ph.D. from the [[University of Utah]].   At the University of Utah in the 1960s, Kay worked with [[Ivan Sutherland]] on pioneering graphics applications including [[Sketchpad]]. Around this time, he also worked as a professional [[jazz]] guitarist.

Kay joined [[Xerox]] Corporation's [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] Research Center ([[Xerox PARC|PARC]]) in 1970. In the seventies he was one of the key members there to develop prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language [[Smalltalk]]. These inventions were later commercialized by [[Apple Computer|Apple]] in the [[Apple Macintosh]].

Kay is one of the fathers of the idea of object-oriented programming, along with some colleagues at PARC and predecessors at the [[Norwegian Computing Centre]]. He is the conceiver of the [[Dynabook]] concept which defined the basics of the laptop computer and the tablet computer and he is also considered by some as the architect of the modern windowing [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).  

After 10 years at Xerox PARC, Kay became [[Atari]]'s chief scientist for three years. 

== Recent work and recognition ==
Starting in 1984, Kay was a Fellow at [[Apple Computer]] until [[Steve Jobs]] eliminated the company's R&amp;D group. He then joined [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] as a [[Disney Fellow]] and remained there until Disney ended its Disney Fellow program. After Disney, Kay worked with a team at [[Applied Minds]], then became a Senior Fellow at [[Hewlett-Packard]] until HP disbanded the Advanced Software Research Team on July 20 2005.  He is currently head of Viewpoints Research Institute.

=== Squeak and Croquet development ===
Kay collaborated with many others to start the open source [[Squeak]] dynamic media software in December 1995 when he was still at Apple, and he continues to work on it. More recently he started, along with [[David A. Smith]], [[David P. Reed]], Andreas Raab, [[Julian Lombardi]], and [[Mark McCahill]], the [[Croquet project]], which seeks to offer an open source networked 3D environment for collaborative work.

===$100 laptop===
At the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in November 2005, the MIT research laboratories unveiled a new [[$100 laptop]] co-developed by Kay for students around the world.

=== Awards and honors ===
In 2001 Alan Kay received the [http://www.udk-berlin.de/doku/award.html UdK 01-Award] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] for pioneering the [[GUI]].

In 2003 he received the ACM [[Turing Award]] for his work on [[object oriented programming]].

In 2004 he received the  [[Kyoto Prize]] and the [[Charles Stark Draper]] Prize along with [[Butler W. Lampson]], [[Robert W. Taylor]] and [[Charles P. Thacker]]

In 2005 he received an honorary doctoral degree from the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]].

&lt;!-- in 2004??, he became an honorary professor at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]]. --&gt;

== Personal Background==
Kay is an avid and gifted musician who plays keyboards and guitar.  He has a special interest in the baroque pipe organ, early keyboard instruments and guitar.  He was a former professional jazz and rock and roll guitarist.    He is married to [[Bonnie MacBird]], a writer/producer/actor/artist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''APL''' (for '''A Programming Language''') is an [[array programming]] language based on a notation invented in [[1957]] by [[Kenneth E. Iverson]] while at [[Harvard University]]. It originated in an attempt to provide consistent notation for the teaching and analysis of topics related to the application of computers. The notation was later used to describe the [[IBM]] [[System/360]] machine architecture, a description much more concise and exact than the existing documentation and revealing several previously unnoticed problems. Then, a [[IBM Selectric typewriter|Selectric]] typeball was made to write a linear representation of this notation. In [[1964]] a subset of the notation was implemented as a programming language.

Dr. Iverson published his notation in [[1962]] in a book titled ''A Programming Language'' and APL got its name from the title of this book. Iverson received the [[Turing Award]] in [[1979]] for his work. As with all programming languages that have had several decades of continual use, APL has changed significantly from the notation described by Iverson in his book. One thing that has remained constant is that APL is [[interpreted programming language|interpretive]] and [[interactive]], features much appreciated by its users. Conversely, its initial lack of support for both [[structured programming|structured]] and [[modular programming|modular]] programming has been solved by all the modern APL incarnations. One much criticized aspect still remains, though: the use of a special character set (see [[APL programming language#Character set|Character set]] below.) These characters have all been incorporated into Unicode, which is now the base character set of several APL products. There is also a pure ASCII reworking of APL called [[J programming language|J]], with greatly increased expressive power.

{{SpecialCharsNote}}

==Overview==
Over a very wide set of problem domains (math, science, engineering, computer design, robotics, data visualization, actuarial science, traditional DP, etc.) APL is an extremely powerful, expressive and concise programming language, typically set in an interactive environment. It was originally created as a way to describe computers, by expressing [[mathematical notation]] in a rigorous way that could be interpreted by a computer. It is easy to learn but APL programs can take some time to understand.  Unlike traditional structured programming languages, code in APL is typically structured as chains of [[monadic]] or [[dyadic]] [[function (programming)|function]]s and [[operator]]s acting on [[array]]s. Because APL has so many nonstandard ''primitives'' (functions, operators, or features built into the language and indicated by a single symbol or a combination of a few symbols), APL does not have function or [[operator precedence]]. The original APL did not have [[control flow|control structure]]s (loops, if-then-else), but the array operations it included could simulate [[structured programming]] constructs. For example, the iota function (which yields an array from 1 to N) can simulate for-loop [[iteration]]. More recent implementations of APL generally include explicit control structures, so that data structure and control-flow structure can be more clearly separated.

The APL environment is called a ''workspace''. In a workspace the user can define programs and data, i.e. the data values exist also outside the programs, and the user can manipulate the data without the necessity to define a program, for example:

:&lt;math&gt;N \leftarrow  4\ 5\ 6\ 7&lt;/math&gt;

Assign the [[coordinate vector|vector]] values  4 5 6 7 to N.

:&lt;math&gt;N+4\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  

Add 4 to all values (giving 8  9 10 11) and Print them (absence of the assignment arrow means &quot;show&quot;).

:&lt;math&gt;+/N\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Print the sum of N, i.e. 22.


The user can save the workspace with all values, programs and execution status. In any case, the programs are usually not [[compiled language|compiled]] but [[interpreted language|interpreted]]. A commercial compiler was brought to market by STSC (now Manugistics).

APL is well-known for its use of a set of non-[[ASCII]] symbols that are an extension of traditional arithmetic and algebraic notation.  These cryptic symbols, some have joked, make it possible to construct an entire [[air traffic control]] system in two lines of code. Indeed, in some versions of APL, it is theoretically possible to express any computable function in one expression, that is in one line of code. You can use the other line for I/O, or constructing a GUI. Because of its condensed nature and non-standard characters, APL has sometimes been termed a &quot;[[write-only language]]&quot;, and reading an APL program can at first feel like decoding an alien tongue.  Because of the unusual [[character set]], many programmers used special APL [[computer keyboard|keyboard]]s in the production of APL code. Nowadays there are various ways to write APL code using only ASCII characters. Indeed most if not all modern implementations use the standard keyboard, displaying APL symbols by use of a particular font.

Advocates of APL claim that the examples of &quot;write-only&quot; code are almost invariably examples of poor programming practice or novice mistakes, which can occur in any language.  However, when implementing an APL module to be run using an interpreter (as was usual), a common tactic was to initially implement the module as separate, mostly understandable lines.  Once the logic was verified, the lines would then be merged into one line for optimal processing in the interpreter.  These APL one-liners, as they were called, were incomprehensible when viewed even a short time later.  The accomplished APL programmer would document the function of the module in comments- if it had to be changed, the code would be discarded and re-implemented.

APL has perhaps had an unusually high percentage of users who are subject-matter experts who know some APL, rather than professional programmers who know something about a subject.

Iverson designed a successor to APL called [[J programming language|J]] which
uses ASCII &quot;natively&quot;.  So far there is only a single source of J implementations: http://www.jsoftware.com/ Other programming languages offer functionality similar to APL. [http://www.aplusdev.org/ A+] is an [[open source]] programming language with many commands identical to APL.

==Examples==
Here's how you would write a program that would [[sorting|sort]] a word list stored in matrix X according to word length:

 X[⍋X+.≠' ';]

Here's a program that finds all [[prime number]]s from 1 to R:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sim R \in R \circ . \times R\right)/R \leftarrow 1 \downarrow \iota R&lt;/math&gt;

Here's how to read it, from right to left:

#&lt;math&gt;\iota\,\!&lt;/math&gt; creates a vector containing [[integer]]s from 1 to R (if R = 6 at the beginning of the program, &lt;math&gt;\iota R\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is 1 2 3 4 5 6)
#Drop first element of this vector (&lt;math&gt;\downarrow&lt;/math&gt; function), i.e. 1. So &lt;math&gt;1 \downarrow \iota R&lt;/math&gt; is 2 3 4 5 6
#Set R to the vector (&lt;math&gt;\leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;, assignment primitive)
#Generate outer product of R multiplied by R, i.e. a matrix which is the ''[[multiplication table]]'' of R by R (&lt;math&gt;\circ . \times&lt;/math&gt;function)
#Build a vector the same length as R with 1 in each place where the corresponding number in R is in the outer product matrix (&lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;, set inclusion function), i.e. 0 0 1 0 1
#Logically negate the values in the vector (change zeros to ones and ones to zeros) (&lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;, negation function), i.e. 1 1 0 1 0
#Select the items in R for which the corresponding element is 1 (&lt;math&gt;/\,\!&lt;/math&gt; function), i.e. 2 3 5

==Calculation==
APL was unique in the speed with which it could perform complex matrix operations.  For example, a very large matrix multiplication would take only a few seconds on a machine which was much less powerful than those today.  There were some technical and other economic reasons for this advantage:
*  Commercial interpreters delivered highly-tuned linear algebra library routines.
*  Very low interpretive overhead was incurred per-array&amp;mdash;not per-element.
*  APL response time compared favorably to the runtimes of early optimizing compilers.

A widely cited paper &quot;The APL Machine&quot; perpetuated the myth that APL made pervasive use of [[lazy evaluation]] where calculations would not actually be performed until the results were needed and then only those calculations strictly required.  Although this technique was used by just a few implementations, it embodies the language's best survival mechanism: not specifying the order of scalar operations.  Even as eventually standardized by X3J10, APL is so highly data-parallel, it gives language implementers immense freedom to schedule operations as efficiently as possible.  As computer innovations such as [[cache memory]], and [[SIMD]] execution became commercially available, APL programs ported with little extra effort spent re-optimizing low-level details.

==Terminology==
APL makes a clear distinction between ''functions'' and ''operators''. Functions take values (variables or constants or expressions) as arguments, and return values as results. Operators take functions as arguments, and return related, derived, functions as results. For example the &quot;sum&quot; function is derived by applying the &quot;reduction&quot; operator to the &quot;addition&quot; function. Applying the same reduction operator to the &quot;ceiling&quot; function (which returns the larger of two values) creates a derived &quot;maximum&quot; function, which returns the largest of a group (vector) of values. In the J language, Iverson substituted the terms 'verb' and 'adverb' for 'function' and 'operator'.

APL also identifies those features built into the language, and represented by a symbol, or a fixed combination of symbols, as ''primitives''. Most primitives are either functions or operators. Coding APL is largely a process of writing non-primitive functions and (in some dialects of APL) operators. However a few primitives are considered to be neither functions nor operators, most noticeably assignment.

==Character set==
APL has always been criticized for its choice of a unique, non-standard character set. The fact that those who learn it usually become ardent adherents shows that there is some weight behind Iverson's idea that the notation used does make a difference. In the beginning, there were few terminal devices which could reproduce the APL character set &amp;mdash; the most popular ones employing the [[IBM]] [[Selectric]] print mechanism along with a custom type element.  With the popularization of the [[Unicode]] standard, which contains an APL character set, the eternal problem of obtaining the required particular fonts seems poised to go away.

== APL symbols and keyboard layout==

[[image:APL_keyboard.gif|center|frame|APL keyboard with special characters]]

Note the mnemonics associating an APL character with a letter: ''question mark'' on ''Q'', ''power'' on ''P'', ''rho'' on ''R'', ''base value'' on ''B'', ''eNcode'' on ''N'', ''modulus'' on ''M'' and so on. This makes it easier for an English-language speaker to type APL on a non-APL keyboard providing one has visual feedback on one's screen.

All APL symbols are present in [[Unicode]]:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;It may be required to significantly reconfigure your browser in order to display Unicode fonts.&lt;/small&gt;

==Usage==
APL has long had a small but fervent user base. It has been particularly popular in financial and insurance applications, in simulations, and in some mathematical applications. But APL has been used in a wide variety of contexts and for many and varied purposes.

==Standardization==
APL has been standardized by the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] [[working group]] X3J10 and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] Joint Technical Committee 1 Subcommittee 22 Working Group 3. The Core APL language is specified in ISO 8485:1989, and the Extended APL language is specified in ISO/IEC 13751:2001.

==Quotes==
* &quot;APL, in which you can write a program to simulate shuffling a deck of cards and then dealing them out to several players in four characters, none of which appear on a standard keyboard.&quot;
** [[David Given]]
* &quot;APL is a mistake, carried through to perfection. It is the language of the future for the programming techniques of the past: it creates a new generation of coding bums.&quot;
** [[Edsger Dijkstra]], [[1968]]
* &quot;By the time the practical people found out what had happened; APL was so important a part of how IBM ran its business that it could not possibly be uprooted.&quot;
** [[Micheal S. Montalbano]] [[1982]] (see [http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/APL-hist.html A Personal History of APL])

==Awards==
There is an annual award for contributions to APL, the [[Iverson Award]] named after the language's creator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Otheruses2|Algol}}
'''ALGOL''' (short for '''ALGO'''rithmic '''L'''anguage) is a family of [[imperative programming|imperative]] [[computer programming|computer]] [[programming language]]s originally developed in the mid [[1950s]] which became the ''de facto'' standard way to report algorithms in print for almost the next 30 years. It was designed to avoid some of the perceived problems with [[FORTRAN]] &lt;!--using uppercase name because of the sentential context--&gt; and eventually gave rise to many other programming languages (including [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]]). ALGOL uses bracketed statement blocks and was the first language to use '''begin''' '''end''' pairs for delimiting them. Fragments of ALGOL-like syntax are sometimes still used as a notation for [[algorithm]]s, so-called [[Pidgin Algol]].

There are three official main branches of ALGOL family: [[ALGOL 58]], '''ALGOL 60''', and [[ALGOL 68]]. Of these, ALGOL 60 was the most widely known in the [[United States]]. [[Niklaus Wirth]] based his own [[Algol-W]] on ALGOL 60, before moving to develop [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]]. [[Algol-W]] was intended to be the next generation ALGOL, but the [[ALGOL 68]] committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced rather than a cleaned, simplified ALGOL 60. The official ALGOL versions are named after the year they were first published. ALGOL 58 was originally known as the '''IAL''' (for '''I'''nternational '''A'''lgorithmic '''L'''anguage.)

''Note: '' throughout its effective life, the name of the programming language ALGOL was always presented in all-uppercase letters, and this is the practice adopted here.

==History==

ALGOL was developed jointly by a committee of European and American computer scientists. It specified three different syntaxes: a reference syntax, a publication syntax, and an implementation syntax. The different syntaxes permitted it to use different keyword names and conventions for decimal points (commas vs. periods) for different languages.

[[John Backus]] developed the [[Backus normal form]] method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58. It was revised and expanded by [[Peter Naur]] to the [[Backus-Naur form]] for ALGOL 60. Both [[John Backus]] and [[Peter Naur]] served on the committee which created ALGOL 60, as did [[Wally Feurzeig]] who later created [[Logo programming language|Logo]]. ALGOL 60 inspired many languages that followed it; the canonical quote in this regard is [[C.A.R. Hoare]]'s &quot;ALGOL 60 was a great improvement on its successors.&quot; The full quote is &quot;Here is a language so far ahead of its time, that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors, but also on nearly all its successors&quot;, but the [[Aphorism|aphoristic]] version is far better known. It is sometimes erroneously attributed to [[Edsger Dijkstra]], also known for his pointed comments, who helped to implement an early ALGOL 60 [[compiler]]. (This statement was in part a criticism of the bloatedness of ALGOL 68.)

The [[Burroughs Corporation]]'s [[B5000]] and its successors were [[stack machine]]s designed to be programmed in an extended variant of ALGOL 60, known as [[Elliott ALGOL]]; indeed their [[operating system]] the [[Master Control Program|MCP]], was written in Elliott ALGOL as far back as 1961. The [[Unisys Corporation]] still markets machines descended from the B5000 today, running the MCP and supporting a diverse set of Elliott ALGOL compilers. Another early implementation was [[Dartmouth ALGOL 30]] on the [[LGP-30]] computer.

==Properties==
ALGOL 60 as officially defined had no I/O facilities; implementations defined their own in ways that were rarely compatible with each other. In contrast, ALGOL 68 offered an extensive library of ''transput'' (ALGOL 68 parlance for Input/Output) facilities.

ALGOL 60 allowed for two [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]] for [[Parameter (computer science)|parameter]] passing: the common call-by-value, and call-by-name.  Call-by-name had certain limitations in contrast to call-by-reference, making it an undesirable feature in language design. For example, it is impossible in ALGOL 60 to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable. However, call-by-name is still beloved of ALGOL implementors for the interesting &quot;[[thunk|thunks]]&quot; that are used to implement it.

ALGOL 68 was defined using a two-level grammar formalism invented by [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]] and which bears his name. ''Van Wijngaarden grammars'' use a [[context-free grammar]] to generate an infinite set of productions that will recognize a particular ALGOL 68 program; notably, they are able to express the kind of requirements that in many other programming language standards are labelled &quot;semantics&quot; and have to be expressed in ambiguity-prone natural language prose, and then implemented in compilers as ''ad hoc'' code attached to the formal language parser.

== Code sample (ALGOL 60) ==

(The way the bolded text has to be written depends on the implementation, e.g. 'INTEGER' (including the quotation marks) for '''integer'''.)

 '''procedure''' Absmax(a) Size:(n, m) Result:(y) Subscripts:(i, k);
     '''value''' n, m; '''array''' a; '''integer''' n, m, i, k; '''real''' y;
 '''comment''' The absolute greatest element of the matrix a, of size n by m 
 is transferred to y, and the subscripts of this element to i and k;
 '''begin''' '''integer''' p, q;
     y := 0; i := k := 1;
     '''for''' p:=1 '''step''' 1 '''until''' n '''do'''
     '''for''' q:=1 '''step''' 1 '''until''' m '''do'''
         '''if''' abs(a[p, q]) &gt; y '''then'''
             '''begin''' y := abs(a[p, q]);
             i := p; k := q
             '''end'''
 '''end''' Absmax

Here's an example of how to produce a table using Elliott 803 ALGOL.

  FLOATING POINT ALGOL TEST'
  BEGIN REAL A,B,C,D'
 
  READ D'
 
  FOR A:= 0.0 STEP D UNTIL 6.3 DO
  BEGIN
    PRINT PUNCH(3),££L??'
    B := SIN(A)'
    C := COS(A)'
    PRINT PUNCH(3),SAMELINE,ALIGNED(1,6),A,B,C'
  END'
  END'

PUNCH(3) sends output to the teleprinter rather than the tape punch.&lt;br&gt;
SAMELINE suppresses the carriage return + line feed normally printed between arguments.&lt;br&gt;
ALIGNED(1,6) controls the format of the output with 1 digit before and 6 after the decimal point.&lt;br&gt;

==Hello World==
Since ALGOL 60 had no I/O facilities, there is no portable &quot;Hello World&quot; program in ALGOL.  The following code could run on an ALGOL implementation for a Burroughs A-Series mainframe, and is taken from [http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/algol/hworld.html this site].

 BEGIN
 FILE F (KIND=REMOTE);
 EBCDIC ARRAY E [0:11];
 REPLACE E BY &quot;HELLO WORLD!&quot;;
 WHILE TRUE DO
   BEGIN
   WRITE (F, *, E);
   END;
 END.

An alternative example, using Elliott Algol I/O is as follows.  In fact, Elliott Algol used different characters for 'open-string-quote' and 'close-string-quote', but [[ASCII]] does not allow these to be shown here.

  '''program''' HiFolks;
  '''begin'''
     '''print''' &quot;Hello world&quot;;
  '''end''';

Here's a version for the Elliott 803 Algol (A104) The standard Elliott 803 used 5 hole paper tape and thus only had upper case.  The code lacked any quote characters so £ (UK Pound Sign) was used for open quote and ? (Question Mark) for close quote.  Special sequencies were placed in double quotes e.g. ££L?? produced a new line on the teleprinter.   

   HIFOLKS’  
   BEGIN
      PRINT £HELLO WORLD£L??’
   END’

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''AWK''' is a general purpose [[computer language]] that is designed for processing text-based data, either in files or data streams. The name AWK is derived from the [[surname]]s of its authors — [[Alfred V. Aho|Alfred V. '''A'''ho]], [[Peter J. Weinberger|Peter J. '''W'''einberger]], and [[Brian Kernighan|Brian W. '''K'''ernighan]]; however, it is commonly pronounced &quot;awk&quot; and not as a string of separate letters. &lt;tt&gt;awk&lt;/tt&gt;, when written in all lowercase letters, refers to the [[Unix]] program that runs other programs written in the AWK programming language.

AWK is an example of a [[programming language]] that extensively uses the [[String (computer science)|string]] [[datatype]], [[associative array]]s (that is, arrays indexed by key strings), and [[regular expression]]s. The power, terseness, and limitations of AWK programs and [[sed]] scripts inspired [[Larry Wall]] to write [[Perl]]. Because of their dense notation, all these languages are often used for writing [[one-liner program]]s.

AWK is one of the early tools to appear in [[Version 7 Unix]] and gained popularity as a way to add computational features to a Unix [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]].
A version of the AWK language is a standard feature of nearly every modern [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]] available today. AWK is mentioned in the [[Single UNIX Specification]] as one of the mandatory utilities of a [[Unix]] [[operating system]]. Besides the [[Bourne shell]], AWK is the only other scripting language available in a [http://www.unix.org/version3/apis/cu.html standard Unix environment]. Implementations of AWK exist as installed software for almost all other operating systems.

==Structure of AWK programs==
Generally speaking, two pieces of data are given to AWK: a command file and a primary input file. A command file (which can be an actual file, or can be included in the [[command line]] invocation of &lt;tt&gt;awk&lt;/tt&gt;) contains a series of commands which tell AWK how to process the input file. The primary input file is typically text that is formatted in some way; it can be an actual file, or it can be read by &lt;tt&gt;awk&lt;/tt&gt; from the standard input. A typical AWK program consists of a series of lines, each of the form

 /''pattern''/ { ''action'' }

where ''pattern'' is a [[regular expression]] and ''action'' is a command. AWK looks through the input file; when it finds a line that matches ''pattern'', it executes the command(s) specified in ''action''. Alternate line forms include:

; &lt;tt&gt;BEGIN { ''action'' }&lt;/tt&gt;
: Executes ''action'' commands at the beginning of the script execution, i.e. before any of the lines are processed.
; &lt;tt&gt;END { ''action'' }&lt;/tt&gt;
: Similar to the previous form, but executes ''action'' ''after'' the end of input.
; &lt;tt&gt;/''pattern''/&lt;/tt&gt;
: Prints any lines matching ''pattern''.
; &lt;tt&gt;{ ''action'' }&lt;/tt&gt;
: Executes ''action'' for each line in the input.

Each of these forms can be included multiple times in the command file. Lines in the command file are executed in order, so if there are two &quot;BEGIN&quot; statements, the first is executed, then the second, and then the rest of the lines. BEGIN and END statements do ''not'' have to be located before and after (respectively) the other lines in the command file.

AWK was created as a broadbased replacement to [[C programming language|C]] algorithmic approaches developed to integrate text parsing methods.

==AWK commands==
AWK commands are the statement that is substituted for ''action'' in the examples above. AWK commands can include function calls, variable assignments, calculations, or any combination thereof. AWK contains built-in support for many functions; many more are provided by the various flavors of AWK. Also, some flavors support the inclusion of [[dynamically linked library|dynamically linked libraries]], which can also provide more functions.

For brevity, the enclosing curly braces ( ''{ }'' ) will be omitted from these examples.

===The ''print'' command===
The ''print'' command is used to output text.  The simplest form of this command is

 print

This displays the contents of the current line. In AWK, lines are broken down into ''fields'', and these can be displayed separately:

; &lt;tt&gt;print $1&lt;/tt&gt;
: Displays the first field of the current line
; &lt;tt&gt;print $1, $3&lt;/tt&gt;
: Displays the first and third fields of the current line, separated by a predefined string called the output field separator (OFS) whose default value is a single space character

Although these fields (''$X'') may bear resemblance to variables (the $ symbol indicates variables in perl), they actually refer to the fields of the current line.  A special case, ''$0'', refers to the entire line.  In fact, the commands &quot;&lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;print $0&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; are identical in functionality.

The ''print'' command can also display the results of calculations and/or function calls:

 print 3+2
 print foobar(3)
 print foobar(variable)
 print sin(3-2)

Output may be sent to a file:

 print &quot;expression&quot; &gt; &quot;file name&quot;

===Variables, et cetera===
Variable names can use any of the characters [A-Za-z0-9_], with the exception of language keywords. The operators ''+ - * /'' are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. For string concatenation, simply place two variables (or string constants) next to each other, optionally with a space in between. String constants are [[delimited]] by double quotes. Statements need not end with semicolons. Finally, comments can be added to programs by using ''#'' as the first character on a line.

===User-defined functions===
In a format similar to [[C programming language|C]], function definitions consist of the keyword &lt;tt&gt;function&lt;/tt&gt;, the function name, argument names and the function body.  Here is an example function:

 function add_three(number, temp) {
   temp = number + 3
   return temp
 }

This statement can be invoked as follows:

 print add_three(36)     # prints '''39'''

Functions can have variables that are in the local scope. The names of these are added to the end of the argument list, though values for these should be omitted when calling the function. It is convention to add some [[whitespace]] in the argument list before the local variables, in order to indicate where the parameters end and the local variables begin.

==Sample applications==
===Hello World===
Here is the ubiquitous &quot;[[Hello world program]]&quot; program written in AWK:

 BEGIN { print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;; exit }

===Print lines longer than 80 characters===
Print all lines longer than 80 characters. Note that the default action is to print the current line.

 length &gt; 80 

===Print a count of words===
Count words in the input, and print lines, words, and characters (like ''wc'')

 { w += NF; c += length}
 END { print NR, w, c }

===Sum first column===
Sum first column of input

 { s += $1 }
 END { print s }

===Calculate word frequencies===
Word frequency, (uses [[associative array]]s)

 BEGIN { FS=&quot;[^a-zA-Z]+&quot;}
 
 { for (i=1; i&lt;=NF; i++)
      words[tolower($i)]++
 }
 
 END { for (i in words)
     print i, words[i]
 }

==Self-contained AWK scripts==
As with many other programming languages, self-contained AWK script can be constructed using the so-called &quot;[[shebang (Unix)|shebang]]&quot; syntax.

For example, a UNIX command called &lt;tt&gt;hello.awk&lt;/tt&gt; that prints the string &quot;Hello, world!&quot; may be built by going first creating a file named &lt;tt&gt;hello.awk&lt;/tt&gt; containing the following lines:

 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 BEGIN { print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;; exit }

==AWK versions and implementations==
AWK was originally written in [[1977]], and distributed with [[Version 7 Unix]].

In [[1985]] its authors started expanding the language, most significantly by adding user-defined functions. The language is described in the book ''The AWK Programming Language'',published [[1988]], and its implementation was made available in releases of [[UNIX System V]]. To avoid confusion with the incompatible older version, this version was sometimes known as &quot;new awk&quot; or ''nawk''. This implementation was released under a [[free software license]] in [[1996]], and is still maintained by Brian Kernighan.

[[GNU]] awk, or ''gawk'', is another free software implementation.  It was written before the original implementation became freely available, and is still widely used. Almost every [[Linux distribution]] comes with a recent version of ''gawk'' and ''gawk'' is widely recognized as the de-facto standard implementation in the [[Linux]] world.

xgawk is a SourceForge project based on ''gawk''. It extends ''gawk'' with dynamically loadable libraries.

mawk is a very fast AWK implementation by Mike Brennan based on a [[byte code]] interpreter.

Downloads and further information about these versions are available from the sites listed below.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Augustus De Morgan was born June 27, 1806{{rf|2|birthyear}} in Madura, [[Madras Presidency]], [[India]] (now [[Madurai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India); His father was Col. De Morgan, who held various appointments in the service of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]]. His mother descended from [[James Dodson]], who computed a table of anti-logarithms, that is, the numbers corresponding to exact [[logarithm]]s. Col. De Morgan moved his family to [[England]] when Augustus was seven months old. As his father and grandfather had both been born in India, De Morgan used to say that he was neither English, nor Scottish, nor Irish, but a Briton &quot;unattached,&quot; using the technical term applied to an undergraduate of [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]] who is not a member of any one of the Colleges.

When De Morgan was ten years old, his father died. Mrs. De Morgan resided at various places in the southwest of England, and her son received his elementary education at various schools of no great account. His mathematical talents were unnoticed till he had reached the age of fourteen. A friend of the family accidentally discovered him making an elaborate drawing of a figure in [[Euclid]] with ruler and compasses, and explained to him the aim of Euclid, and gave him an initiation into demonstration.

De Morgan suffered from a physical defect&amp;mdash;one of his eyes was rudimentary and useless. As a consequence, he did not join in the sports of the other boys, and he was even made the victim of cruel practical jokes by some schoolfellows. Some [[psychologist]]s have held that the perception of distance and of solidity depends on the action of two eyes, but De Morgan testified that so far as he could make out he perceived with his one eye distance and solidity just like other people.

He received his secondary education from Mr. Parsons, a Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, who could appreciate classics much better than mathematics. His mother was an active and ardent member of the [[Church of England]], and desired that her son should become a clergyman; but by this time De Morgan had begun to show his non-grooving disposition, due no doubt to some extent to his physical infirmity.

===University education===
In [[1823]], at the age of sixteen he entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he immediately came under the tutorial influence of [[George Peacock]] and [[William Whewell]]. They became his life-long friends; from the former he derived an interest in the renovation of algebra, and from the latter an interest in the renovation of logic&amp;mdash;the two subjects of his future life work.

At college the [[flute]], on which he played exquisitely, was his recreation. He took no part in athletics but was prominent in the musical clubs. His love of knowledge for its own sake interfered with training for the great mathematical race; as a consequence he came out fourth [[wrangler]]. This entitled him to the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts]]; but to take the higher degree of [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] and thereby become eligible for a fellowship it was then necessary to pass a theological test. To the signing of any such test De Morgan felt a strong objection, although he had been brought up in the [[Church of England]]. In about [[1875]] theological tests for academic degrees were abolished in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.

===London University===
As no career was open to him at his own university, he decided to go to the Bar, and took up residence in [[London]]; but he much preferred teaching mathematics to reading law. About this time the movement for founding the London University took shape. The two ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge were so guarded by theological tests that no Jew or Dissenter outside the Church of England could enter as a student, still less be appointed to any office. A body of liberal-minded men resolved to meet the difficulty by establishing in London a University on the principle of religious neutrality. De Morgan, then 22 years of age, was appointed Professor of Mathematics. His introductory lecture &quot;On the study of mathematics&quot; is a discourse upon mental education of permanent value which has been recently reprinted in the United States.

The London University was a new institution, and the relations of the Council of management, the Senate of professors and the body of students were not well defined. A dispute arose between the professor of anatomy and his students, and in consequence of the action taken by the Council, several of the professors resigned, headed by De Morgan. Another professor of mathematics was appointed, who was accidentally drowned a few years later. De Morgan had shown himself a prince of teachers: he was invited to return to his chair, which thereafter became the continuous centre of his labours for thirty years.

The same body of reformers&amp;mdash;headed by [[Henry Peter Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Lord Brougham]], a Scotsman eminent both in science and politics who had instituted the London University&amp;mdash;founded about the same time a [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]]. Its object was to spread scientific and other knowledge by means of cheap and clearly written treatises by the best writers of the time. One of its most voluminous and effective writers was De Morgan. He wrote a great work on ''The Differential and Integral Calculus'' which was published by the Society; and he wrote one-sixth of the articles in the ''Penny Cyclopedia'', published by the Society, and issued in penny numbers. When De Morgan came to reside in London he found a congenial friend in William Frend, notwithstanding his mathematical heresy about negative quantities. Both were arithmeticians and actuaries, and their religious views were somewhat similar. Frend lived in what was then a suburb of London, in a country-house formerly occupied by [[Daniel Defoe]] and [[Isaac Watts]]. De Morgan with his flute was a welcome visitor; and in [[1837]] he married Sophia Elizabeth, one of Frend's daughters.

The London University of which De Morgan was a professor was a different institution from the [[University of London]]. The University of London was founded about ten years later by the Government for the purpose of granting degrees after examination, without any qualification as to residence. The London University was affiliated as a teaching college with the University of London, and its name was changed to [[University College, London|University College]]. The University of London was not a success as an examining body; a teaching University was demanded. De Morgan was a highly successful teacher of mathematics. It was his plan to lecture for an hour, and at the close of each lecture to give out a number of problems and examples illustrative of the subject lectured on; his students were required to sit down to them and bring him the results, which he looked over and returned revised before the next lecture. In De Morgan's opinion, a thorough comprehension and mental assimilation of great principles far outweighed in importance any merely analytical dexterity in the application of half-understood principles to particular cases.

De Morgan had a son George, who acquired great distinction in mathematics both at University College and the University of London. He and another like-minded alumnus conceived the idea of founding a Mathematical Society in London, where mathematical papers would be not only received (as by the Royal Society) but actually read and discussed. The first meeting was held in University College; De Morgan was the first president, his son the first secretary. It was the beginning of the [[London Mathematical Society]].

===Retirement and death===
In the year [[1866]] the chair of mental philosophy in University College fell vacant. Dr. Martineau, a [[Unitarian]] clergyman and professor of mental philosophy, was recommended formally by the Senate to the Council; but in the Council there were some who objected to a Unitarian clergyman, and others who objected to theistic philosophy. A layman of the school of Bain and Spencer was appointed. De Morgan considered that the old standard of religious neutrality had been hauled down, and forthwith resigned. He was now 60 years of age. His pupils secured a pension of $ 500 for him, but misfortunes followed. Two years later his son George -- the younger Bernoulli, as he loved to hear him called, in allusion to the two eminent mathematicians of that name, related as father and son -- died. This blow was followed by the death of a daughter. Five years after his resignation from University College De Morgan died of nervous prostration on [[March 18]] [[1871]], in the 65th year of his age.

==Mathematical work==
De Morgan was a brilliant and witty writer, whether as a controversialist or as a correspondent. In his time there flourished two Sir [[William Hamilton]]s who have often been confounded. The one was [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet]] (that is, his title was inherited), a Scotsman, professor of logic and metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh; the other was a knight (that is, won the title), an Irishman, professor at astronomy in the University of Dublin. The baronet contributed to logic, especially the doctrine of the quantification of the predicate; the knight, whose full name was [[William Rowan Hamilton]], contributed to mathematics, especially [[geometric algebra]], and first described the [[Quaternion]]s. De Morgan was interested in the work of both, and corresponded with both; but the correspondence with the Scotsman ended in a public controversy, whereas that with the Irishman was marked by friendship and terminated only by death. In one of his letters to Rowan, De Morgan says, &quot;Be it known unto you that I have discovered that you and the other Sir W. H. are reciprocal polars with respect to me (intellectually and morally, for the Scottish baronet is a polar bear, and you, I was going to say, are a polar gentleman). When I send a bit of investigation to [[Edinburgh]], the W. H.  of that ilk says I took it from him. When I send you one, you take it from me, generalize it at a glance, bestow it thus generalized upon society at large, and make me the second discoverer of a known theorem.&quot;

The correspondence of De Morgan with Hamilton the mathematician extended over twenty-four years; it contains discussions not only of mathematical matters, but also of subjects of general interest.  It is marked by geniality on the part of Hamilton and by wit on the part of De Morgan. The following is a specimen: Hamilton wrote, &quot;My copy of Berkeley's work is not mine; like Berkeley, you know, I am an Irishman.&quot; De Morgan replied, &quot;Your phrase 'my copy is not mine' is not a bull. It is perfectly good English to use the same word in two different senses in one sentence, particularly when there is usage. Incongruity of language is no bull, for it expresses meaning. But incongruity of ideas (as in the case of the Irishman who was pulling up the rope, and finding it did not finish, cried out that somebody had cut off the other end of it) is the genuine bull.&quot;

De Morgan was full of personal peculiarities. We have noticed his almost morbid attitude towards religion, and the readiness with which he would resign an office. On the occasion of the installation of his friend, Lord Brougham, as Rector of the University of Edinburgh, the Senate offered to confer on him the honorary degree of LL. D.; he declined the honour as a misnomer. He once printed his name: Augustus De Morgan, ''H - O - M - O - P - A - U - C - A - R - U - M - L - I - T - E - R - A - R - U - M''.

He disliked the country, and while his family enjoyed the seaside, and men of science were having a good time at a meeting of the British Association in the country he remained in the hot and dusty libraries of the metropolis. He said that he felt like [[Socrates]], who declared that the farther he got from [[Athens]] the farther was he from happiness. He never sought to become a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], and he never attended a meeting of the Society; he said that he had no ideas or sympathies in common with the physical philosopher. His attitude was doubtless due to his physical infirmity, which prevented him from being either an observer or an experimenter. He never voted at an election, and he never visited the [[House of Commons]], or the [[Tower of London]], or [[Westminster Abbey]].

Were the writings of De Morgan published in the form of collected works, they would form a small library. We have noticed his writings for the Useful Knowledge Society. Mainly through the efforts of Peacock and Whewell, a Philosophical Society had been inaugurated at Cambridge; and to its Transactions De Morgan contributed four memoirs on the foundations of algebra, and an equal number on formal logic. The best presentation of his view of algebra is found in a volume, entitled ''Trigonometry and Double Algebra'', published in [[1849]]; and his earlier view of formal logic is found in a volume published in [[1847]]. His most unique work is styled a ''Budget of Paradoxes''; it originally appeared as letters in the columns of the ''Athenæum'' journal; it was revised and extended by De Morgan in the last years of his life, and was published posthumously by his widow. If you wish to read something entertaining, get De Morgan's ''Budget of Paradoxes'' out of the library. We shall consider more at length his theory of algebra, his contribution to exact logic, and his Budget of Paradoxes.

[[George Peacock]]'s theory of algebra was much improved by D. F. Gregory, a younger member of the Cambridge School, who laid stress not on the permanence of equivalent forms, but on the permanence of certain formal laws. This new theory of algebra as the science of symbols and of their laws of combination was carried to its logical issue by De Morgan; and his doctrine on the subject is still followed by English algebraists in general.  Thus Chrystal founds his ''Textbook of Algebra'' on De Morgan's theory; although an attentive reader may remark that he practically abandons it when he takes up the subject of infinite series. De Morgan's theory is stated in his volume on ''Trigonometry and Double Algebra''. In the chapter (of the book) headed &quot;On symbolic algebra&quot; he writes: &quot;In abandoning the meaning of symbols, we also abandon those of the words which describe them. Thus addition is to be, for the present, a sound void of sense. It is a mode of combination represented by &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;; when &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; receives its meaning, so also will the word addition. It is most important that the student should bear in mind that, with one exception, no word nor sign of arithmetic or algebra has one atom of meaning throughout this chapter, the object of which is symbols, and their laws of combination, giving a symbolic algebra which may hereafter become the grammar of a hundred distinct significant algebras. If any one were to assert that &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt; might mean reward and punishment, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, etc., might stand for virtues and vices, the reader might believe him, or contradict him, as he pleases, but not out of this chapter. The one exception above noted, which has some share of meaning, is the sign &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; placed between two symbols as in &lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;. It indicates that the two symbols have the same resulting meaning, by whatever steps attained. That &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, if quantities, are the same amount of quantity; that if operations, they are of the same effect, etc.&quot;

Here, it may be asked, why does the symbol &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; prove refractory to the symbolic theory? De Morgan admits that there is one exception; but an exception proves the rule, not in the usual but illogical sense of establishing it, but in the old and logical sense of testing its validity. If an exception can be established, the rule must fall, or at least must be modified. Here I am talking not of grammatical rules, but of the rules of science or nature.

De Morgan proceeds to give an inventory of the fundamental symbols of algebra, and also an inventory of the laws of algebra. The symbols are 0, 1, +, &amp;minus;, &amp;times;, ÷, ()&lt;sup&gt;()&lt;/sup&gt;, and letters; these only, all others are derived. His inventory of the fundamental laws is expressed under fourteen heads, but some of them are merely definitions. The laws proper may be reduced to the following, which, as he admits, are not all independent of one
another:

#Law of signs. +&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+, +&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;, &amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;, &amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+, &amp;times;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;, &amp;times;&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;÷, ÷&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;÷, ÷&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;.
#Commutative law. ''a''+''b'' = ''b''+''a'', ''ab''=''ba''.
#Distributive law. ''a''(''b''+''c'') = ''ab''+''ac''.
#Index laws. ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''+''c''&lt;/sup&gt;, (''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''bc''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''(ab)''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;= ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;.
#''a''&amp;minus;''a''=0, ''a''÷''a''=1.

The last two may be called the rules of reduction.  De Morgan professes to give a complete inventory of the laws which the symbols of algebra must obey, for he says, &quot;Any system of symbols which obeys these laws and no others, except they be formed by combination of these laws, and which uses the preceding symbols and no others, except they be new symbols invented in abbreviation of combinations of these symbols, is symbolic algebra.&quot; From his point of view, none of the above principles are rules; they are formal laws, that is, arbitrarily chosen relations to which the algebraic symbols must be subject. He does not mention the law, which had already been pointed out by Gregory, namely, &lt;math&gt;(a+b)+c = a+(b+c), (ab)c = a(bc)&lt;/math&gt; and to which was afterwards given the name of the ''law of association''. If the commutative law fails, the associative may hold good; but not ''vice versa''. It is an unfortunate thing for the symbolist or formalist that in universal arithmetic &lt;math&gt;m^n&lt;/math&gt; is not equal to &lt;math&gt;n^m&lt;/math&gt;; for then the commutative law would have full scope. Why does he not give it full scope? Because the foundations of algebra are, after all, real not formal, material not symbolic. To the formalists the index operations are exceedingly refractory, in consequence of which some take no account of them, but relegate them to applied mathematics. To give an inventory of the laws which the symbols of algebra must obey is an impossible task, and reminds one not a little of the task of those philosophers who attempt to give an inventory of the ''a priori'' knowledge of the mind.

De Morgan's work entitled ''Trigonometry and Double Algebra'' consists of two parts; the former of which is a treatise on [[Trigonometry]], and the latter a treatise on generalized algebra which he calls Double Algebra. But what is meant by Double as applied to algebra? and why should Trigonometry be also treated in the same textbook? The first stage in the development of algebra is ''arithmetic'', where numbers only appear and symbols of operations such as &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;, etc. The next stage is ''universal arithmetic'', where letters appear instead of numbers, so as to denote numbers universally, and the processes are conducted without knowing the values of the symbols. Let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; denote any numbers; then such an expression as &lt;math&gt;a-b&lt;/math&gt; may be impossible; so that in universal arithmetic there is always a proviso, ''provided the operation is possible''. The third stage is ''single algebra'', where the symbol may denote a quantity forwards or a quantity backwards, and is adequately represented by segments on a straight line passing through an origin. Negative quantities are then no longer impossible; they are represented by the backward segment. But an impossibility still remains in the latter part of such an expression as &lt;math&gt;a+b\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; which arises in the solution of the quadratic equation. The fourth stage is ''double algebra''; the algebraic symbol denotes in general a segment of a line in a given plane; it is a double symbol because it involves two specifications, namely, length and direction; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as denoting a quadrant. The expression &lt;math&gt;a+b\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; then represents a line in the plane having an abscissa &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and an ordinate &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. Argand and Warren carried double algebra so far; but they were unable to interpret on this theory such an expression as &lt;math&gt;e^{a\sqrt{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;. De Morgan attempted it by ''reducing'' such an expression to the form &lt;math&gt;b+q\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and he considered that he had shown that it could be always so reduced. The remarkable fact is that this double algebra satisfies all the fundamental laws above enumerated, and as every apparently impossible combination of symbols has been interpreted it looks like the complete form of algebra.

If the above theory is true, the next stage of development ought to be ''triple'' algebra and if &lt;math&gt;a+b\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; truly represents a line in a given plane, it ought to be possible to find a third term which added to the above would represent a line in space. Argand and some others guessed that it was &lt;math&gt;a + b\sqrt{-1} + c\sqrt{-1}\,^{\sqrt{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; although this contradicts the truth established by Euler that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}\,^{\sqrt{-1}}=e^{-\frac{1}{2} \pi}&lt;/math&gt;. De Morgan and many others worked hard at the problem, but nothing came of it until the problem was taken up by Hamilton. We now see the reason clearly: the symbol of double algebra denotes not a length and a direction; but a multiplier and ''an angle''. In it the angles are confined to one plane; hence the next stage will be a ''quadruple algebra'', when the axis of the plane is made variable. And this gives the answer to the first question; double algebra is nothing but analytical plane trigonometry, and this is why it has been found to be the natural analysis for alternating currents. But De Morgan never got this far; he died with the belief &quot;that double algebra must remain as the full development of the conceptions of arithmetic, so far as those symbols are concerned which arithmetic immediately suggests.&quot;

When the study of mathematics revived at the University of Cambridge, so did the study of logic. The moving spirit was Whewell, the Master of Trinity College, whose principal writings were a ''History of the Inductive Sciences'', and ''Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences''. Doubtless De Morgan was influenced in his logical investigations by Whewell; but other influential contemporaries were Sir W. Hamilton of Edinburgh, and Professor Boole of Cork. De~Morgan's work on ''Formal Logic'', published in [[1847]], is principally remarkable for his development of the numerically definite syllogism. The followers of [[Aristotle]] say that from two particular propositions such as '' Some M's are A's '', and '' Some M's are B's '' nothing follows of necessity about the relation of the A's and B's. But they go further and say in order that any relation about the A's and B's may follow of necessity, the middle term must be taken universally in one of the premises.  De~Morgan pointed out that from ''Most M's are A's and Most M's are B's'' it follows of necessity that ''some A's are B's'' and he formulated the numerically definite syllogism which puts this principle in exact quantitative form. Suppose that the number of the M's is &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, of the M's that are A's is &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and of the M's that are B's is &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;; then there are at least &lt;math&gt;(a+b-m)&lt;/math&gt; A's that are B's. Suppose that the number of souls on board a steamer was 1000, that 500 were in the saloon, and 700 were lost; it follows of necessity, that at least 700+500-1000, that is, 200, saloon passengers were lost. This single principle suffices to prove the validity of all the Aristotelian moods; it is therefore a fundamental principle in necessary reasoning.

Here then De Morgan had made a great advance by introducing ''quantification of the terms''.  At that time Sir W. Hamilton was teaching at Edinburgh a doctrine of the quantification of the predicate, and a correspondence sprang up. However, De Morgan soon perceived that Hamilton's quantification was of a different character; that it meant for example, substituting the two forms ''The whole of A is the whole of B'', and ''The whole of A is a part of B'' for the Aristotelian form ''All A's are B's''. Philosophers generally have a large share of intolerance; they are too apt to think that they have got hold of the whole truth, and that everything outside of their system is error. Hamilton thought that he had placed the keystone in the Aristotelian arch, as he phrased it; although it must have been a curious arch which could stand 2000 years without a keystone. As a consequence he had no room for De Morgan's innovations. He accused De Morgan of plagiarism, and the controversy raged for years in the columns of the ''Athenæum'', and in the publications of the two writers.

The memoirs on logic which De Morgan contributed to the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society subsequent to the publication of his book on ''Formal Logic'' are by far the most important contributions which he made to the science, especially his fourth memoir, in which he begins work in the broad field of the ''logic of relatives''. This is the true field for the logician of the twentieth century, in which work of the greatest importance is to be done towards improving language and facilitating thinking processes which occur all the time in practical life. Identity and difference are the two relations which have been considered by the logician; but there are many others equally deserving of study, such as equality, equivalence, consanguinity, affinity, etc.

In the introduction to the ''Budget of Paradoxes'' De Morgan explains what he means by the word. &quot;A great many individuals, ever since the rise of the mathematical method, have, each for himself, attacked its direct and indirect consequences. I shall call each of these persons a ''paradoxer'', and his system a ''paradox''. I use the word in the old sense: a paradox is something which is apart from general opinion, either in subject matter, method, or conclusion. Many of the things brought forward would now be called ''crackpots'', which is the nearest word we have to old ''paradox''. But there is this difference, that by calling a thing a crackpot we mean to speak lightly of it; which was not the necessary sense of paradox. Thus in the 16th century many spoke of the earth's motion as the ''paradox of Copernicus'' and held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem, and some I think who even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth century the depravation of meaning took place, in England at least.&quot;

How can the sound paradoxer be distinguished from the false paradoxer? De Morgan supplies the following test: &quot;The manner in which a paradoxer will show himself, as to sense or nonsense, will not depend upon what he maintains, but upon whether he has or has not made a sufficient knowledge of what has been done by others, especially as to the mode of doing it, a preliminary to inventing knowledge for himself... New knowledge, when to any purpose, must come by contemplation of old knowledge, in every matter which concerns thought; mechanical contrivance sometimes, not very often, escapes this rule. All the men who are now called discoverers, in every matter ruled by thought, have been men versed in the minds of their predecessors and learned in what had been before them. There is not one exception.&quot;

&quot;I remember that just before the American Association met at Indianapolis in [[1890]], the local newspapers heralded a great discovery which was to be laid before the assembled savants -- a young man living somewhere in the country had squared the circle.  While the meeting was in progress I observed a young man going about with a roll of paper in his hand. He spoke to me and complained that the paper containing his discovery had not been received. I asked him whether his object in presenting the paper was not to get it read, printed and published so that everyone might inform himself of the result; to all of which he assented readily. But, said I, many men have worked at this question, and their results have been tested fully, and they are printed for the benefit of anyone who can read; have you informed yourself of their results? To this there was no assent, but the sickly smile of the false paradoxer&quot; [Note: De Morgan did not say this (how could he? He died far before 1890...). Rather, as pointed out on the discussion page, this paragraph (and the rest of the article) is copied verbatim from a lecture given in 1916]

The ''Budget'' consists of a review of a large collection of paradoxical books which De Morgan had accumulated in his own library, partly by purchase at bookstands, partly from books sent to him for review, partly from books sent to him by the authors. He gives the following classification: squarers of the circle, trisectors of the angle, duplicators of the cube, constructors of perpetual motion, subverters of gravitation, stagnators of the earth, builders of the universe. You will still find specimens of all these classes in the New World and in the new century.

De Morgan gives his personal knowledge of paradoxers. &quot;I suspect that I know more of the English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another? -- and less of late years than in earlier time? -- I have talked to more than five in each year, giving more than a hundred and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they naturally resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is ''[[bona fide]]'', the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many -- the mass, indeed -- are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.&quot;

A paradoxer to whom De Morgan paid the compliment which Achilles paid Hector -- to drag him round the walls again and again -- was James Smith, a successful merchant of Liverpool. He found &lt;math&gt;\pi = 3 \frac{1}{8}&lt;/math&gt;. His mode of reasoning was a curious caricature of the ''reductio ad absurdum'' of Euclid. He said let &lt;math&gt;\pi = 3 \frac{1}{8}&lt;/math&gt;, and then showed that on that supposition, every other value of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; must be absurd; consequently &lt;math&gt;\pi = 3\frac{1}{8}&lt;/math&gt; is the true value. The following is a specimen of De Morgan's dragging round the walls of Troy: &quot;Mr. Smith continues to write me long letters, to which he hints that I am to answer. In his last of 31 closely written sides of note paper, he informs me, with reference to my obstinate silence, that though I think myself and am thought by others to be a mathematical Goliath, I have resolved to play the mathematical snail, and keep within my shell. A mathematical ''snail''! This cannot be the thing so called which regulates the striking of a clock; for it would mean that I am to make Mr. Smith sound the true time of day, which I would by no means undertake upon a clock that gains 19 seconds odd in every hour by false quadrative value of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. But he ventures to tell me that pebbles from the sling of simple truth and common sense will ultimately crack my shell, and put me ''hors de combat''. The confusion of images is amusing: Goliath turning himself into a snail to avoid &lt;math&gt;\pi = 3\frac{1}{8}&lt;/math&gt; and James Smith, Esq., of the Mersey Dock Board: and put ''hors de combat'' by pebbles from a sling. If Goliath had crept into a snail shell, David would have cracked the Philistine with his foot. There is something like modesty in the implication that the crack-shell pebble has not yet taken effect; it might have been thought that the slinger would by this time have been singing -- And thrice [and one-eighth] I routed all my foes, And thrice [and one-eighth] I slew the slain.&quot;

In the region of pure mathematics De Morgan could detect easily the false from the true paradox; but he was not so proficient in the field of physics. His father-in-law was a paradoxer, and his wife a paradoxer; and in the opinion of the physical philosophers De Morgan himself scarcely escaped. His wife wrote a book describing the phenomena of spiritualism, table-rapping, [[table-turning]], etc.; and De Morgan wrote a preface in which he said that he knew some of the asserted facts, believed others on testimony, but did not pretend to know ''whether'' they were caused by spirits, or had some unknown and unimagined origin. From this alternative he left out ordinary material causes. Faraday delivered a lecture on ''Spiritualism'', in which he laid it down that in the investigation we ought to set out with the idea of what is physically possible, or impossible; De Morgan could not understand this.

=== Relations ===
De Morgan discovered [[relational algebra]] in his (1966: 208-46), first published in 1860. This algebra was extended by [[Charles Peirce]] (who admired De Morgan and met him shortly before his death), and re-exposited and further extended in vol. 3 of [[Ernst Schröder]]'s ''Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik''. [[Relational algebra]] proved critical to the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' of [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. In turn, this algebra became the subject of much further work, starting in 1940, by [[Alfred Tarski]] and his colleagues and students at the [[University of California]].

==Notes==
{{ent|1|De_Morgan}} De Morgan, (1838) ''Induction (mathematics)'', ''The Penny Cyclopedia''.
{{ent|2|birthyear}} The year of his birth may be found by solving a conundrum proposed by himself, &quot;I was &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; years of age in the year &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; &quot; (He was 43 in 1849). The problem is indeterminate, but it is made strictly determinate by the century of its utterance and the limit to a man's life.

In [[Norse mythology]], '''Asgard''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: '''Ásgarðr''') is the realm of the gods, the [[Æsir]], thought to be separate from the realm of the mortals, [[Midgard]]. 

The walls surrounding Asgard were built by a [[giant (mythology)|giant]]. As payment for his work, the giant was to receive the hand of [[Freyja]] in marriage, as well as the [[sun]] and the [[moon]]. This was agreed, provided that the work was completed within six months. In order to avoid honouring the agreement, [[Loki]] transformed himself into a mare to lure away the giant's magic horse, [[Svadilfari]]. The job was therefore not completed on time, and the gods evaded the payment.

The plain of [[Idavoll]] is the centre of Asgard. The Æsir meet there for discussions on important issues: the male gods meet in a hall called [[Gladsheim]], and the female gods in a hall called [[Vingólf]]. They also meet daily at the [[Well of Urd]], beneath [[Yggdrasill]].

[[Image:Apollo program insignia.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Apollo Program insignia]]
'''Project Apollo''' was a series of [[human spaceflight]] missions undertaken by the [[United States|United States of America]] using the [[Apollo spacecraft]] and [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn launch vehicle]], conducted during the years 1961–1972. It was devoted to the goal of landing a man on the [[Moon]] and returning him safely to Earth within the decade of the 1960s. This goal was achieved with the ''[[Apollo 11]]'' mission in July 1969. The program continued into the early 1970s to carry out the initial hands-on scientific exploration of the Moon, with a total of six successful landings. As of 2006, there has not been any further human spaceflight beyond [[low earth orbit]]. The later [[Skylab|Skylab program]] and the joint American-Soviet [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] used equipment originally produced for Apollo, and are often considered to be part of the overall program. The name [[Apollo]], like earlier manned space-flight programs, was named after a god from [[classical civilization]]s, and comes from one of the Greek gods.

==Background==

The Apollo Program was originally conceived late in the [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration as a follow-on to the [[Mercury program]], doing advanced manned earth-orbital missions. In fact, it became the third program, following [[Gemini program|Gemini]]. The Apollo Program was dramatically reoriented to an aggressive lunar landing goal by President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] with his announcement at a special joint session of Congress on [[May 25]], [[1961]]:

:&quot;...I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important in the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish...&quot; (Excerpt from &quot;Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs&quot;.[http://www.jfklibrary.org/j052561.htm])

==Choosing a mission mode==
Having settled upon the Moon as a target, the Apollo mission planners were faced with the challenge of designing a set of flights that would meet Kennedy's stated goal while minimizing risk to human life, cost and demands on technology and astronaut skill.  

Three possible plans were considered.
 
[[Image:Apollo Direct Ascent.png|thumb|left|225px|Apollo configuration for &lt;br /&gt;Direct Ascent and&lt;br /&gt; Earth Orbit Rendezvous - 1961 (NASA)]]

* '''Direct ascent:''' This plan was to boost a spaceship directly to the moon.  The entire spacecraft would land on and return from the moon. This would have required a [[Nova rocket]] far more powerful than any in existence at the time.

* '''Earth orbit rendezvous:''' This plan, known as Earth orbit rendezvous (EOR), would have required the launch of two [[Saturn V]] rockets, one containing the space ship and one containing fuel.  The spaceship would have docked in earth orbit and be fueled with enough fuel to make it to the moon and back.  Again, the entire spacecraft would have landed on the moon.

* '''Lunar Surface Rendezvous:'''   This would have required two spacecraft to be launched - the first one being an automated vehicle carrying propellants would land on the Moon, to be followed some time later by the 'manned' vehicle.  Propellant would be transferred from the automated vehicle to the 'manned' vehicle before the 'manned' vehicle could return to Earth.

* '''Lunar orbit rendezvous:''' This plan, which was adopted, is credited to [[John Houbolt]] and used the technique of 'Lunar Orbit Rendezvous' (LOR).  The spacecraft was modular, composed of a '[[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]]' (CSM) and a '[[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]]' (LM; originally Lunar Excursion Module {LEM}).  The CSM contained the life support systems for the three man crew's five day round trip to the moon and the [[heat shield]] for their reentry to Earth's [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].  The LM would separate from the CSM in lunar orbit and carry two astronauts for the descent to the lunar surface, then back up to the CSM.

In contrast with the other plans, the LOR plan required only a small part of the spacecraft to land on the moon, thereby minimizing the mass to be launched from the moon's surface for the return trip.  The mass to be launched was further minimized by leaving part of the LM (that with the descent engine) behind, on the moon.

The [[Lunar Module]] itself was composed of a descent stage and an ascent stage, the former serving as a launch platform for the latter when the lunar exploration party blasted off for lunar orbit where they would dock with the CSM prior to returning to Earth.  The plan had the advantage that since the LM was to be eventually discarded, it could be made very light, so the moon mission could be launched with a single Saturn V rocket.  However, at the time that LOR was decided, some mission planners were uneasy at the large numbers of dockings and undockings called for by the plan.

To learn lunar landing techniques, astronauts practiced in the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle ([[LLRV]]), a flying vehicle that simulated (by means of a special, additional jet engine) the reduced gravity that the Lunar Module would actually fly in.

==Flights==

The Apollo program included eleven manned flights, designated ''[[Apollo 7]]'' through ''[[Apollo 17]]'', all launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], [[Florida]]. ''[[Apollo 4]]'' through ''[[Apollo 6]]'' were unmanned test flights (officially there was no ''Apollo 2'' or ''Apollo 3''). The ''[[Apollo 1]]'' designation was retroactively applied to the originally planned first manned flight which ended in a disastrous fire during a launch pad test that killed three astronauts, [[Virgil Grissom|Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom]], [[Edward Higgins White|Edward White]], and [[Roger Bruce Chaffee|Roger B. Chaffee]], in January 1967. The first of the manned flights employed the [[Saturn IB]] launch vehicle; the remaining flights all used the more powerful [[Saturn V]]. Two of the flights (''[[Apollo 7]]'' and ''[[Apollo 9]]'') were Earth orbital missions, two of the flights (''[[Apollo 8]]'' and ''[[Apollo 10]]'') were lunar orbital missions, and the remaining 7 flights were lunar landing missions (although one, ''[[Apollo 13]]'', failed to land).

''[[Apollo 7]]'' tested the Apollo command and service modules (CSM) in Earth orbit. ''[[Apollo 8]]'' tested the CSM in lunar orbit. ''[[Apollo 9]]'' tested the [[lunar module]] (LM) in earth orbit. ''[[Apollo 10]]'' tested the LM in lunar orbit. ''[[Apollo 11]]'' achieved the first human lunar landing. ''[[Apollo 12]]'' achieved the first lunar landing at a precise location. ''[[Apollo 13]]'' failed to achieve a lunar landing, but succeeded in returning the crew safely to earth following a potentially disastrous in-flight explosion. ''[[Apollo 14]]'' resumed the lunar exploration program. ''[[Apollo 15]]'' introduced a new level of lunar exploration capability, with a long-stay-time LM and a lunar roving vehicle. ''[[Apollo 16]]'' was the first manned landing in the lunar highlands. ''[[Apollo 17]]'', the final mission, was the first to include a scientist-astronaut, and the program's first manned night launch.

==Apollo Applications Program== 

In the speech which initiated Apollo, Kennedy declared that no other program would have as great a long-range effect on America's ambitions in [[outer space]]. Following the success of Project Apollo, both NASA and its major contractors investigated several post-lunar applications for the Apollo hardware. The &quot;Apollo Extension Series&quot;, later called the &quot;[[Apollo Applications Program]]&quot;, proposed at least ten flights. Many of these would use the space that the [[lunar module]] took up in the Saturn rocket to carry scientific equipment. 

One plan involved using the [[Saturn IB]] to take the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) to a variety of low-earth orbits for missions lasting up to 45 days.  Some missions would involve the docking of two CSMs, and transfer of supplies. The [[Saturn V]] would be necessary to take it to [[polar orbit]], or [[sun-synchronous orbit]] (neither of which has yet been achieved by any manned spacecraft), and even to the [[geosynchronous]] orbit of [[Syncom 3]], a communications satellite not quite in [[geostationary]] orbit. This was the first functioning [[communications satellite]] at that now-common great distance from the Earth, and it was small enough to be carried through the hatch and taken back to Earth for study as to the effects of radiation on its electronic components in that environment over a period of years. A return to the moon was also planned, this time to orbit for a longer time to map the surface with high-precision equipment. This mission would not include a landing. 

Of all the plans only two were implemented; the [[Skylab]] space station (May 1973 – February 1974), and the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] (July 1975). [[Skylab]]'s fuselage was constructed from the second stage of a [[Saturn IB]], and the station was equipped with the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], itself based on a [[lunar module]]. The station's three crews were ferried into orbit atop [[Saturn IB]]s, riding in CSMs; the station itself had been launched with a modified [[Saturn V]]. Skylab's last crew departed the station on [[February 8]], [[1974]], whilst the station itself returned prematurely to Earth in 1979, by which time it had become the oldest operational Apollo component.

The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project involved a docking in Earth orbit between an un-named CSM and a Soviet [[Soyuz spacecraft]]. The mission lasted from [[July 15]] to [[July 24]], [[1975]]. Although the Soviet Union continued to operate the Soyuz and [[Salyut]] space vehicles, NASA's next manned mission would not be until [[STS-1]] on [[April 12]], [[1981]].

==End of the program==

[[Image:ApolloCmd.JPG|thumbnail|left|Unflown command module CM-007 in a museum]]

Originally three additional lunar landing missions had been planned, as ''Apollo 18'' through ''Apollo 20''. In light of the drastically shrinking [[NASA]] budget and the decision not to produce a second batch of Saturn Vs, these missions were cancelled to make funds available for the development of the [[Space Shuttle]], and to make their Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V launch vehicles available to the [[Skylab]] program. Only one of the Saturn Vs was actually used; the others became museum exhibits.

Another excerpt from Kennedy's Special Message to Congress:

:&quot;I believe we should go to the moon. But I think every citizen of this country as well as the Members of the Congress should consider the matter carefully in making their judgment, to which we have given attention over many weeks and months, because it is a heavy burden, and there is no sense in agreeing or desiring that the United States take an affirmative position in outer space, unless we are prepared to do the work and bear the burdens to make it successful. If we are not, we should decide today and this year.

[[Image:LunarLander.JPG|thumbnail|left|Lunar lander LM2 at the [[National_Air_And_Space_Museum|National Air and Space Museum]] ]]

:&quot;This decision demands a major national commitment of scientific and technical manpower, material and facilities, and the possibility of their diversion from other important activities where they are already thinly spread. It means a degree of dedication, organization and discipline which have not always characterized our research and development efforts. It means we cannot afford undue work stoppages, inflated costs of material or talent, wasteful interagency rivalries, or a high turnover of key personnel.

:&quot;New objectives and new money cannot solve these problems. They could in fact, aggravate them further--unless every scientist, every engineer, every serviceman, every technician, contractor, and civil servant gives his personal pledge that this nation will move forward, with the full speed of freedom, in the exciting adventure of space.&quot; (Excerpt from &quot;Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs&quot;)

==Reasons for Apollo==

The Apollo program was at least partly motivated by psycho-political considerations, in response to persistent perceptions of American inferiority in space technology vis-a-vis the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], in the context of the [[Cold War]] and the [[Space Race]]. In this respect it succeeded brilliantly. In fact, American superiority in manned spaceflight was achieved in the precursory [[Gemini program]], even before the first Apollo flight.  

The Apollo program stimulated many areas of technology.  The [[Apollo Guidance Computer|flight computer]] design used in both the lunar and command modules was, along with the [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman Missile System]], the driving force behind early research into [[integrated circuit]]s.  The [[fuel cell]] developed for this program was the first practical fuel cell.  Computer controlled machining ([[CNC]]) was pioneered in fabricating Apollo structural components.

Many [[astronaut]]s and [[astronaut|cosmonaut]]s have commented on the profound effects that seeing earth from space has had on them. One of the most important legacies of the Apollo program was the now-common, but not universal view of Earth as a fragile, small planet, captured in the photographs taken by the astronauts during the lunar missions. The most famous of these photographs, taken by the [[Apollo 17]] astronauts, is &quot;[[The Blue Marble]].&quot; These photographs have also motivated many people toward [[environmentalism]] and [[space colonization]].

== Miscellaneous information ==

*The cost of the entire Apollo program: [[United States dollar|USD]] $25.4 billion -1969 Dollars ($135-billion in 2005 Dollars). See [[NASA Budget]]. (Includes Mercury, Gemini, Ranger, Surveyor, Lunar Orbitar, Apollo programs.) Apollo spacecraft and Saturn rocket cost alone, was about $ 83-billion 2005 Dollars (Apollo spacecraft cost $ 28-billion (CS/M $ 17-billion; LM $ 11-billion), Saturn I, IB, V costs about $ 46-billion 2005 dollars). 
*Amount of [[Moon rocks|moon material]] brought back by the Apollo program: 381.7 [[kilogram|kg]] (841.5 lb). Most of the material is stored at the [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]] in Houston.

==Missions==
[[Image:Moon map showing Apollo missions.PNG|thumb|Location of Apollo missions on the moon]]
The Apollo program used four types of launch vehicles:
*[[Little Joe II]] - unmanned suborbital [[launch escape system]] development.
*[[Saturn I]] - unmanned suborbital and orbital hardware development.
*[[Saturn IB]] - unmanned and manned earth orbit development and operational missions.
*[[Saturn V]] - unmanned and manned earth orbit and lunar missions.

Something to note with Apollo flights is that Marshall Space Flight Center, which designed the Saturn rockets, referred to the flights as Saturn-Apollo (SA), while Kennedy Space Center referred to the flights as Apollo-Saturn (AS). This is why the unmanned Saturn 1 flights are referred to as SA and the unmanned Saturn 1B are referred to as AS.

The original pre-lunar landing program was more conservative but, as the 'all-up' test flights for the Saturn V proved successful, some missions were deleted. The revised schedule published in October 1967 had the first manned Apollo CSM earth orbit mission (''Apollo 7'') followed by an Earth Orbit Rendezvous of the CSM and LM launched on two Saturn 1Bs (''Apollo 8'') followed by a Saturn V launched CSM on a Large Earth Orbit Mission (''Apollo 9'') followed by the Saturn V launched dress rehearsal in Lunar Orbit with ''Apollo 10''. By the summer of 1968 it became clear to program managers that a fully functional LM would not be available for the ''Apollo 8'' mission. Rather than perform a simple earth orbiting mission, they chose to send ''Apollo 8'' around the moon during Christmas. The original idea for this switch was the brainchild of George Low. Although it has often been claimed that this change was made as a direct response to Soviet attempts to fly a piloted [[Zond program|Zond]] spacecraft around the moon, there is no evidence that this was actually the case.  NASA officials were aware of the Soviet Zond flights, but the timing of the Zond missions does not correspond well with the extensive written record from NASA about the ''Apollo 8'' decision.  It is relatively certain that the ''Apollo 8'' decision was primarily based upon the LM schedule, rather than fear of the Soviets beating the Americans to the moon.

'''Assault''' is a [[crime]] of [[violence]] against another [[human|person]]. In some [[jurisdiction]]s, assault is used to refer to the actual violence, while in other jurisdictions (e.g. some in the [[United States]],  [[England and Wales]]), assault refers only to the threat of violence, while the actual violence is [[battery (crime)|battery]]. '''Simple assaults''' do not involve deadly [[weapon]]s; '''[[aggravated assault]]s''' often do. 

Assault is often defined to include not only violence, but any physical contact with another person without their consent. When assault is defined like this, exceptions are provided to cover such things as normal social behavior (for example, patting someone on the back).

[[English law]] makes distinctions based on the degree of injury, between:
* [[common assault]] (which can be even the most minor assault)
* assault with [[actual bodily harm]] (ABH)
* assault with [[grievous bodily harm]] (GBH)

==American Jurisprudence==
American '''[[common law]]''' has traditionally defined assault as an attempt to commit a [[battery (crime)|battery]]. 

Assault is typically treated as a [[misdemeanor]] and not as a [[felony]].  The more serious crime of [[aggravated assault]] is treated as a felony.

Four elements were required at common law:   1) The apparent, present ability to carry out; 2) an unlawful attempt; 3) to commit a violent injury; 4) upon another.  As the criminal law evolved, element 1 was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice.  These four elements were eventually codified in most States.

Modern American statutes define assault as:
1) an attempt to cause or purposely, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to another; or,
2) negligently causing bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon.  

The requirement is that a person be the subject of the attack or threatened attack. The principle underlying the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]] 2004 applies only to offenses over which the [[United States]] government has jurisdiction, namely crimes committed on [[Federal Government of the United States|Federal]] properties, against certain [[Federal Government of the United States|Federal]] officials and employees, and by members of the military, and treats the [[fetus]] as a separate person for the purposes of all levels of assault including [[murder]] and [[attempted murder]]:

&quot;Sec. 1841. Protection of unborn children
:(a)(1) Whoever engages in conduct that violates any of the provisions of law listed in subsection (b) and thereby causes the death of, or bodily injury (as defined in section 1365) to, a child, who is in utero at the time the conduct takes place, is guilty of a separate offense under this section.
:(2)(A) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the punishment for that separate offense is the same as the punishment provided under Federal law for that conduct had that injury or death occurred to the unborn child's mother.
:2(B) An offense under this section does not require proof that--
::(i) the person engaging in the conduct had knowledge or should have had knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was pregnant; or
::(ii) the defendant intended to cause the death of, or bodily injury to, the unborn child.
:2(C) If the person engaging in the conduct thereby intentionally kills or attempts to kill the unborn child, that person shall instead of being punished under subparagraph (A), be punished as provided under sections 1111, 1112, and 1113 of this title for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being.&quot;

Some States also define assault as an attempt to menace (or actual menacing) by placing another person in fear of imminent serious bodily injury.

States vary as to whether it is possible to commit an &quot;attempted assault&quot; since it can be considered a double [[inchoate]] offense. 

In some States, [[consent (criminal)|consent]] is a complete defense to assault.  In other jurisdictions, mutual consent is an incomplete defense, with the result that the [[misdemeanor]] is treated as a '''[[petty misdemeanor]]'''.

===Example===
Two men wave metal pipes threateningly at each other in an alley.  They are ten feet away from each other.  When one man advances, the other retreats, maintaining the distance between them.  The police come and break up the disturbance.  They charge each man with assault.  

The men would probably not be found guilty in an American common law jurisdiction. Being ten feet away does not make it likely or apparent that he would have the present ability to carry out an unlawful act.

However, they would probably be found guilty in a modern American jurisdiction. Each actor is trying to cause bodily injury to another and the fear of bodily injury is reasonable.

Some possible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof are:
*A defendant could argue that since he was drunk, he could not form the [[intention (criminal)|specific intent]] to commit assault. This defense would most likely fail since only involuntary [[intoxication defense|intoxication]] is accepted as a defense in most American jurisdictions.
*The defendants could also argue that they were engaged in mutually consensual behavior.

==General defenses to assaults==
Although the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions, the folloiwng represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault:
===Consent===
[[consent (criminal)|Consent]] may a complete or partial defense to assault. In some jurisdictions, most notably [[England]], it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe: see [http://www.lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non%20Fatal%20Assaults/Consent%20R%20v%20Brown.htm R v Brown (1993) 2 All ER 75]). This can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] [[sexual activity]], the most notable case being the [[Operation Spanner]] case. 
===Arrest and other official acts===
[[Police officers]] and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of effecting an [[arrest]] or generally carrying out their official duties. Thus, a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary, etc.
===Punishment===
In some jurisdictions, [[caning]] and other forms of [[corporal punishment]] are a part of the [[culture]]. Self-evidently, if it is a state-administered [[punishment]], e.g. as in [[Singapore]], the officers who physically adminster the punishment have [[immunity]]. Some states also permit the use of less severe punishment for [[child]]ren in [[school]] and at home by [[parent]]s. In [[English law]], s58 Children Act 2004, limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s39 Criminal Justice Act 1988.
===Self-defense===
[[Self-defense (theory)|Self defense and defense of others]] may be defenses to liability. They usually require that the degree of force used was both reasonable and proportionate to the degree of force threatened.
===Prevention of crime===
This may or may not involve self defense in that, using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault, but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence.
===[[Defense of property]]===
Some states allow force to be used to prevent damage to valuable property either in its own right, or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime (in English law, under s5 [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]] it may be argued that the defendant has a ''lawful excuse'' to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s3 Criminal Law Act 1967) subject to the need to deter [[vigilante]]s and excessive self-help.

'''Álfheim''' (''[[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]'' '''Álfheimr''' 'Elf-home') is the abode of the ''Álfar'' '[[Elves]]' in [[Norse Mythology|Norse mythology]] and appears also in northern [[English ballads]] under the forms '''Elfhame''' and '''Elphame''', sometimes modernized as '''Elfland''' or '''Elfenland'''. It is also an ancient name for the modern Swedish province of [[Bohuslän]].

==The Elven abode==
===In Old Norse texts===
Álfheim as an abode of the Elves is mentioned only twice in [[Old Norse]] texts. 

The [[eddic poem]] ''[[Grimnismal|Grímnismál]]'' describes twelve divine dwellings beginning in stanza&amp;nbsp;5 with:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Ydalir call they &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; the place where [[Ullr|Ull]]&lt;br/&gt;
A hall for himself hath set;&lt;br/&gt;
And Álfheim the gods &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; to [[Freyr|Frey]] once gave&lt;br/&gt;
As a tooth-gift in ancient times.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[tooth-gift]] was a gift given to an [[infant]] on the cutting of the first tooth.

[[Snorri Sturluson]] in the ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' relates as the first of a series of abodes in heaven:
&lt;blockquote&gt;That which is called Álfheim is one, where dwell the peoples called [[Light Elves|Light-elves]] [''Ljósálfar'']; but the [[Dark elf|Dark-elves]] [''dökkálfar''] dwell down in the earth, and they are unlike in appearance, but by far more unlike in nature. The Light-elves are fairer to look upon than the sun, but the Dark-elves are blacker than pitch.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The account later, in speaking of a hall called [[Gimli|Gimlé]] and the southernmost end of heaven that shall survive when heaven and earth have passed away, explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is said that another heaven is to the southward and upward of this one, and it is called [[Andlang]] [''Andlangr'' 'Endlong'] but the third heaven is yet above that, and it is called [[Vídbláin]] [''Vídbláinn'' 'Wide-blue'] and in that heaven we think this abode is. But we believe that none but Light-Elves inhabit these mansions now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is not indicated whether these heavens are identical to Álfheim or distinct. Some texts read Vindbláin (''Vindbláinn'' 'Wind-blue') instead of Vídbláin.

Modern commentators speculate (or sometimes state as fact) that Álfheim was one of the nine worlds (''heima'') mentioned in stanza&amp;nbsp;2 of the eddic poem ''[[Völuspá]]''.

===In English text===
In several [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[English language|English]] [[ballad]]s about the [[fairy|fairies]] and their lore, the realm of the those folk is called ''Elphame'' or ''Elfhame'', though at other times ''Elfland'' or '''Elfenland''.  The fairy queen is often called the &quot;Queen of Elphame&quot; in ballads such as that of [[Thomas the Rhymer]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;'I'm not the Queen of Heaven, Thomas,&lt;br/&gt;
That name does not belong to me;&lt;br/&gt;
I am but the Queen of fair Elphame&lt;br/&gt;
Come out to hunt in my follie.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elfhame, or Elfland, is portrayed in a variety of ways in these ballads and stories, most commonly as mystical and benevolent, but also at times as sinister and wicked. The mysteriousness of the land, and its otherworldly powers are a source of scepticism and distrust in many tales. Examples of journeys to the realm include &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot; and the fairy tale &quot;[[Childe Rowland]]&quot;, the latter being a particularly negative view of the land.

===Used by J. R. R. Tolkien===
The twentieth century fantasy writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] Anglicized the Old Norse name ''Álfheim'' as ''[[Elvenhome]]'' which is imagined in his tales as lying in a coastal region of the [[Undying Lands]] in the far west. The High King of the Elves in the west was [[Ingwë]], an echo of the name [[Yngvi]] often found as a name for Frey, whose abode was in ''Álfheim'' according to the ''Grímnismál''.  

==The region in Scandinavia==
===About the region and its folk===
The [[Ynglinga saga]], when relating the events of the reign of King [[Gudröd the Hunter|Gudröd]] (''Guðröðr'') the Hunter relates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Álfheim, at that time, was the name of the land between the ''Raumelfr'' ['Raum Elf river', the modern Glomma river] and the ''Gautelfr'' ['Gaut Elf river', the modern Göta älv].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The words &quot;at that time&quot; indicates the name for the region was archaic or obsolete by the [[13th century]]. The element ''elfr'' is a common word for 'river' and appears in other river names. It is cognate with [[Middle Low German]] ''elve'' 'river' and the name of the river [[Elbe]]. The Raum Elf marked the border of the region of Raumaríki and the Gaut Elf marked the border of Gautland (modern [[Götaland]]). It corresponds closely to the historical Swedish province of [[Bohuslän]].

The name Álfheim here may have nothing to do with ''Álfar'' 'Elves', but may derive from a word meaning 'gravel layer'.

However the ''[[Thorsteins saga Víkingssonar]] '' claims that the two rivers and the country was named from King Álf the Old (''Álfr hinn gamli'') who once ruled there, and that his descendants were all related to the Elves and were more handsome than any other people except for the giants, a unique and possibly corrupt reference to giants being especially good looking. The ''[[Sögubrot af Nokkrum]]'' also mentions the special good looks of the kindred of King Álf the Old.

===Traditions of Álf the Old===
According to ''Thorsteins saga Víkingssonar'', King Álf the Old was married to Bryngerd (''Bryngerðr'') the daughter of King '''[[Raum the Old|Raum]]''' of Raumaríki.

But according to the ''[[Hversu Noregr byggdist]]'', Álf, also called Finnálf, was a son of King Raum who inherited from his father the land from the Gaut Elf river (the modern [[Göta älv]] river) north to the Raum Elf river (the modern [[Glomma]] river), and that the land was then called Álfheim.

Finnálf married Svanhild (''Svanhildr'') who was called Gold-feather (''Gullfj&amp;#491;ðr'') and was the daughter of Day (''[[Dagr]]'') son of Dayspring (''[[Delling]]r'') by Sun (''[[Sol (goddess)|Sól]]'') daughter of ''[[Mundilfari]]''. Dag as a personification of day and the sun-goddess Sól are mentioned elsewhere, but only the ''Hversu'' mentions their daughter. Svandhild bore Finnálf a son named Svan the Red (''Svanr inn Rauðr'') who was father of Sæfari, father of Úlf (''Úlfr''), father of Álf, father of Ingimund (''Ingimundr'') and Eystein (''Eysteinn'').

According to the eddic poem ''[[Hyndluljód]]'' (stanza&amp;nbsp;12), Óttar, whose genealogy is the subject of this poem, was son of Innstein (''Innsteinn''), son of Álf the Old, son of Úlf, son of Sæfari, son of Svan the Red. So the Innstein of the ''Hyndluljód'' and ''Eystein'' of the ''Hversu'' are presumably identical.

===Later kings of Álfheim===
====Stuff of Legend====
Later kings are mentioned in some sagas.

According to [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (Book 8), the sons of King [[Gandálf the Old]] joined King [[Harald Hildetand|Harald]] for the [[battle of Bråvalla]]. The ''[[Sögubrot af Nokkrum|Sögubrot]]'' names the sons of Gandálf as Álfar (''Álfarr'') and Álfarin (''Álfarinn'') and makes them members of King Harald's bodyguard. Presumably they died in the battle. But the kingdom of this Gandálf is not identified in these texts.

The ''Sögubrot'' also relates that [[Sigurd Ring|Sigurd Hring]] (''Sigurðr Hringr''), who was Harald's viceroy on the Swedish throne, married Álfhild, the daughter of King Álf the Old of Álfheim. But in a later passage she appears as a descendant of King Álf. The ''Hversu Novegr byggdist'' provides instead a lineage of King Álf the Old of Álfheim who was father of Álfgeir the father of Gandálf the father of Álfhild the mother of the famous [[Ragnar Lodbrok]] (by Sigurd Hring). That Álfhild's father was the same Gandálf whose sons were at the Battle of Bravalla makes good sense in legendary chronology. But this genealogy may have resulted from misidentification of Gandálf the Old of the battle of Bråvalla with Gandálf son of Álfgeir of the ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'' who is discussed below. Or if the two Gandálfs may be rightly identified then the chronology is badly garbled.

In all these accounts, the son of Hring and Álfhild was supposedly the famous Ragnar Lodbrok, husband of [[Áslaug]] (''Áslaugr'') the mother of Sigurd Hart (''Sigurðr Hj&amp;#491;rt'') whose daughter Ragnhild (''Ragnhildr'') married [[Halfdan the Black]] and bore to him [[Harald I of Norway|Harald Fairhair]], the first historic king of all Norway.

''[[Illuga saga Gríðarfóstra]]'' relates of a king Áli of Alfheim and his queen Alfrun. When the queen died, the king married a beautiful but evil woman named Grimhild. She murdered him and tyrannized Alfheim until it was laid waste. His daughter Signy would marry king Hringr of Denmark.

====On the borders of history====
The ''Ynglinga saga'', ''Saga of Halfdan the Black'', and ''Saga of Harald Fairhair'', all included in the ''[[Heimskringla]]'', tell of kings of Álfheim at the end of the legendary period:

* '''Álf:''' His daughter Álfhild (''Álfhildr'') married King [[Gudröd the Hunter]] of [[Raumaríki]] and [[Vestfold|Westfold]] who brought with her half of the territory of [[Vingulmork]] as her dowry. She bore to Gudröd a son named Óláf (''Óláfr'') who was afterwards named Geirstada-Álf (''Geirstaða-Álfr'') and was the elder half-brother of [[Halfdan the Black]].

* '''Álfgeir:''' He as son of Álf. He regained Vingulmork and placed his son Gandálf (''Gandálfr'') over it as king.

* '''Gandálf:''' He was son of Álfgeir. Since this Gandálf was an older contemporary of Harald Fairhair and since the historical Viking leaders identified as sons of Ragnar Lodbrok in some traditions were also contemparies of Harald Fairhair, it is not impossible that Álfhild, the supposed mother of Ragnar Lodbrok, was the daughter of this Gandálf as the ''Hversu Noregr byggdist'' states.  What is told in the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' is that after many indecisive battles between Gandálf and Halfdan the Black, Vingulmork was divided between them, Halfdan regaining the portion which had been the dowry of his grandfather's first wife Álfhild. Two sons of Gandálf named Hýsing (''Hýsingr'') and Helsing (''Helsingr'') later led a force against Halfdan but fell in battle and a third son named Haki fled into Álfheim. When Halfdan's son Harald Fairhair  succeeded his father, Gandálf and his son Haki were both part of an alliance of kings who attacked Harald. Haki was slain but Gandálf escaped. There was further war between Gandálf and Harald. At last Gandálf fell in battle and Harald seized all of Gandálf's land up to the Raum Elf river, at that time not taking Álfheim itself.

But later parts of his saga show Harald in full control of the land west of the Gaut Elf river showing that Álfheim did soon become part of his kingdom. From that point it ceased to be an independent region. The Saga of Harald Fairhair relates that it was first conquered by the Swedish king Eirik Eymundsson ([[Erik Anundsson]]) who lost it to Harald Fairhair.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Faroe stamp 430 The First Human Beings.jpg|thumb|Ask and Embla on a postage stamp of the Faroe Islands, 2003 by [[Anker Eli Petersen]].]]
In [[Norse Mythology]] '''Ask and Embla''' were the first two humans created by the gods, analogous with [[Adam and Eve]].

[[Odin]] and his brothers, [[Ve]] and [[Vili]], created all nine worlds of Norse cosmology.  They then found two logs on a beach and gave them a human shape.  Odin gave them the breath of life; Vili gave them wit and emotions; Ve gave them senses and speech.  These two people, Ask (&quot;[[ash (tree)|ash]]&quot;), the male, and Embla (&quot;[[elm]]&quot;), became the progenitors of humanity; they lived in [[Midgard]]. 

==Symbolism==
The idea that the first humans were shaped from tree-trunks is apparently a part of the cyclic notions, where light and darkness relieve each other, separated by the semidarkness of the dawn and dusk.

We all know the optical illusions of the twilight, where the outline of an object looks like a human being, an animal or some kind of living creature. But when we take a closer look we become aware that the object is a tree-trunk, a tuft or a boulder.

The function of the gods as creators of the visible World is their capacity as the bringers of light and darkness. If you can imagine that a living creature can turn into a rock or a tree-trunk when the light arrives, then why not go the other way around and claim that the first humans originally were washed up [[driftwood]]?

==Micro cosmos==
Another, just as legitimate explanation, could be conceptions concerning the Micro cosmos. According to this kind of notion, the Cosmos repeats itself in all things, great and small.

Our ancestors knew of course, that the skeleton was the basic structure of the human body. The ribs of the chest, the arms and the fingers can associate to the branches of the treetop, while the feet and toes could pass for the roots of the tree.

There are by the way, vague reminiscences of an ancient tree-cult in the [[Völuspá]]. The poem often touches on mythical notions regarding trees and woods.

The ash and the elm-tree have always been regarded as suitable timber for everyday use. The wood was especially used as shafts on tools, bows, spears and arrows.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Alabama_River.jpg|300px|thumb|The Alabama River at [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] in 2004]]
The '''Alabama River''', in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Alabama]], is formed by the [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and [[Coosa River|Coosa]] rivers, which unite about six miles above [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].  

It flows west as far as [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]], then southwest until, 
about 45 miles (72 km) from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], it unites with the [[Tombigbee River|Tombigbee]] to form the [[Mobile River|Mobile]] and [[Tensas River|Tensas]] rivers, which discharge into [[Mobile Bay]]. 

The course of the Alabama is tortuous. Its width varies from 200 to 300 yards (200 to 300 m), and its depth from 3 to 7 feet (1 to 2 m). Its length as measured by the [[United States Geological Survey]] is 312 miles (502 km), and by steamboat measurement, 420 miles (676 km).  

The river crosses the richest agricultural and timber districts of the state, and [[railway]]s connect it with the [[mineral]] regions of north central Alabama.  

The principal tributary of the Alabama is the [[Cahaba River]] about 200 miles (300 km long, which enters it about 10 miles (16 km) below Selma.  Of the rivers which form the Alabama, the Coosa crosses the mineral region of Alabama, and is navigable for light-draft boats from [[Rome, Georgia]] (where it is formed by the junction of the [[Oostanaula River|Oostanaula]] and [[Etowah River|Etowah]] rivers) to about 117 miles (188 km) above [[Wetumpka River|Wetumpka]] (about 102 miles below Rome and 26 miles (42 km) below Greensport), and from Wetumpka to its junction with the Tallapoosa; the channel of the river has been considerably improved by the federal government.  

The navigation of the Tallapoosa river which has its source in [[Paulding County, Georgia]], and is about 250 miles (400 km) long, is prevented by [[shoal]]s and a 60 foot (18 m) fall at Tallassee, a few miles north of its junction with the Coosa.  The Alabama is navigable throughout the year.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alain de Lille''' (Alanus ab Insulis) (c. [[1128]] - [[1202]]), [[France|French]] [[theology|theologian]] and poet, was born, probably at [[Lille]], some years before 1128.  

Little is known of his life.  He seems to have taught in the schools of [[Paris]], and he attended the [[Third Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council]] in [[1179]].  He afterwards inhabited [[Montpellier]] (he is sometimes called Alanus de Montepessulano), lived for a time outside the walls of any cloister, and finally retired to [[Citeaux]], where he died in 1202.  

He had a very widespread reputation during his lifetime and his knowledge, more varied than profound, caused him to be called ''Doctor universalis''. Among his very numerous works two poems entitle him to a distinguished place in the [[Latin literature]] of the middle ages; one of these, the ''De planctu naturae'', is an ingenious satire on the vices of humanity.  He likened [[homosexual]] behavior to [[grammatical]] barbarism, thus creating the allegory of grammatical &quot;conjugation&quot; which was to have its successors throughout the Middle Ages.  The ''Anticlaudianus'', a treatise on morals as [[Medieval allegory|allegory]], the form of which recalls the pamphlet of Claudian against Rufinus, is agreeably versified and relatively pure in its latinity.  

As a theologian Alain de Lille shared in the mystic reaction of the second half of the 12th century against the [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophy]].  His [[mysticism]], however, is far from being as absolute as that of the Victorines.  In the ''Anticlaudianus'' he sums up as follows: Reason, guided by prudence, can unaided discover most of the truths of the physical order; for the apprehension of religious truths it must trust to faith.  This rule is completed in his treatise, ''Ars catholicae fidei'', as follows: Theology itself may be demonstrated by reason.  Alain even ventures an immediate application of this principle, and tries to prove geometrically the dogmas defined in the [[Creed]].  This bold attempt is entirely factitious and verbal, and it is only his employment of various terms not generally used in such a connection ([[axiom]], [[theorem]], [[corollary]], etc.) that gives his treatise its apparent originality.  

Alain de Lille has often been confounded with other persons named Alain, in particular with Alain, archbishop of Auxerre, Alan, abbot of Tewkesbury, Alain de Podio, etc.  Certain facts of their lives have been attributed to him, as well as some of their works: thus the ''Life of St Bernard'' should be ascribed to Alain of Auxerre and the ''Commentary upon Merlin'' to [[Alan, abbot of Tewkesbury|Alan of Tewkesbury]].  Neither is the philosopher of Lille the author of a ''Memoriale rerum difficilium'', published under his name; and it is exceedingly doubtful whether the ''Dicta Alani de lapide philocophico'' really issued from his pen.  On the other hand, it now seems practically demonstrated that Alain de Lille was the author of the ''Ars catholicae fidei'' and the ''treatise Contra haereticos''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Alamanni''', '''Allemanni''', or '''Alemanni''' were an alliance of warbands formed from [[Germanic tribe]]s, first mentioned by [[Dio Cassius]] when they fought [[Caracalla]] in [[213]]. They apparently dwelt in the basin of the [[Main River|Main]], to the south of the [[Chatti]].

==Tribal connections==
The Alamanni emerged from the [[Irminones]]. According to [[Asinius Quadratus]] their name &amp;mdash;&quot;all men&quot;&amp;mdash;indicates that they were a conglomeration of various tribes formed into warbands, similar to the contemporary [[Huns]]. Another source {{fact}} claims the root of Alamann is ''al-'' from which are also derived Greek ''allos'' &quot;other, alien&quot; and Old High German ''Elisâzzo'' &quot;, Elsaz or Alsace): &quot;the land on the other side of the [[Rhine]]&quot;. There can be little doubt, however, that the ancient [[Hermunduri]] formed the bulk of the composite nation. Other groups included the [[Brisgavi]], [[Juthungi]], [[Bucinobantes]], [[Lentienses]], and perhaps the [[Armalausi]]. Close allies of the Alamanni were the East Germanic  [[Suebi]], or Suabi (hence [[Swabia]]). The Hermunduri had apparently belonged to the Suebi, but it is likely enough that reinforcements from new Suebic tribes had now moved westward. In later times the names ''Alamanni'' and ''Suebi'' seem to become synonymous, although some of the Suebi later migrated to [[Hispania]] and established an independent kingdom there that endured well into the 6th century.
