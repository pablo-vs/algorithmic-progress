The '''AOL Instant Messenger''' ('''AIM''') is an ad-supported [[instant messaging]] and [[Presence information|presence]] [[computer program]], [[publishing|published]] by [[AOL]] in October of 1997, which uses the [[OSCAR protocol|OSCAR instant messaging protocol]] and the [[TOC protocol]]. The most recent [[Computer software|software]] versions are '''AIM Triton 1.0.4''', released on [[January 26]], [[2006]] (for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] 2000/XP), '''AIM Triton Beta 1.2.10.3''', released on [[February 14]], [[2006]] (for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] 2000/XP), '''AIM 5.9.3861''', released on [[August 10]], [[2005]] (for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] 98/ME/2000/XP), '''AIM 4.7.1333''', released on [[February 18]], [[2004]] (for [[Mac OS X]]), and '''AIM 1.5.286''', with an unknown release date (for various [[Linux]] distributions). AOL has described this technology as a means of &quot;immediate cross-[[Internet]] [[communication]]&quot;

==About==
AIM allows users to communicate instantly through text to their &quot;buddies&quot; (or bots such as [[SmarterChild]] or [[ZolaOnAOL]]) around the world, provided they have the AIM software. AIM has 195 million users (January 2003), with a large portion using [[Internet slang]]. Advocates claim that it is easy to locate these users by visiting chatrooms that AOL has set up solely for those purposes. Chat topics range from heavy metal music to current affairs. AOL also has a member directory where AIM users can locate others online who share their interests. AIM is also noteworthy for its use of [[buddy icon|buddy icons]] and [[buddy profile|buddy profiles]], allowing its users to construct a personal [[avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]] and small personal information page.

AIM's setup varies greatly from [[MSN Messenger]] in that it does not require approval from one buddy to be added to another's buddy list (MSN's default settings send a message to a user notifying them if anyone has added them and letting them choose whether or not to block that user). As a result, many users keep other unsuspecting users on their buddy list to read their profiles or see if they are online (if the said user had blocked them before), A user can block another user from all communications, but some users keep extra usernames for avoiding these blocks.

Since version 2.0, AIM has included person-to-person text messaging, chatroom messaging, and the ability to share files [[peer-to-peer]] with one's buddies.  Somewhere in the 4.x series, the AIM client for [[Microsoft Windows]] added the ability to play games against one another (This uses the WildTangent engine, which is listed as adware.). Recent (4.3 and later) versions of the client software store one's contact information on AOL's servers, so one can keep track of up to 500 buddies from any computer with Internet access. Stand-alone official AIM client software is available [[gratis|for free]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[Windows CE]], and [[Palm OS]]. It was believed that versions of AIM including and above 4.0 contained a clause in the [[software license]] that disallowed the use of third party clients, so some users still use the 3.0 series of AIM.  However, the latest version of AOL Instant Messenger's software license does allow the use of third party clients, subject to the terms and conditions of that third party.

There is also a version of AIM, called AIM Express, that is implemented in [[DHTML]] and runs in a  [[web browser]].  It is intended for use by people who are unable or unwilling to install an executable client on their machines but still want to use instant messaging.  AIM Express supports many of the standard features included in the stand-alone client, but does not provide advanced features like file transfer, audio chat, or video conferencing.  

The standard protocol that AIM clients use to communicate is called OSCAR. AIM Express uses another protocol called TOC. TOC has also been made available to the public, which some people believe is an attempt to throw a bone to third-party client developers and lure them away from OSCAR.  If this is the case, it has not been entirely successful. AOL often changes the details of the OSCAR protocol, which tends to keep third-party clients from working properly. This has resulted in quite a bit of difficulty for programmers of third party clients.

[[Apple Computer]]'s [[iChat AV]] software, released in June 2003 for [[Mac OS X]], was the first AIM-compatible client to allow for audio and video conferencing over the AIM protocol. In February, 2004, AIM 5.5 was released, allowing Windows users to video conference with each other and with iChat users. Although AIM is the most feature rich official release of a mainstream instant messenger for the [[Apple Macintosh]], it lacks several features that the latest Microsoft Windows version offers.

AIM software is the first to use online video streaming advertisements, using ads from [[eyewonder]]

AOL has recently released its new client software, [[AIM Triton|Triton]]. Triton is an overhauled version of the AIM client, which has many of the features from the popular third party plug-ins, including tabbed messages and AIM logging. Triton replaces the classic AIM client software.

AOL has also recently released [http://mail.aim.com AIM Mail] with the latest version of the AIM client, offering 2GB @aim.com e-mail accounts for all users.  Beyond the account size, AIM Mail boasts both webmail and IMAP interfaces, as well as AIM presence and Single Log-on.

AIM is also notorious for security weaknesses that enable many users to [[exploit]] through third party software to perform a myriad of malicious acts. Although most are harmless and merely annoying, (such as being kicked off the AIM service) some perform other potentially dangerous actions such as harvesting [[ip address | IP addresses]] and sending viruses upon a direct connection.

===AIM terminology===
AIM and AOL use several terms for elements of their instant messaging, which are different than other messengers. These include:

* '''[[Away message]]:''' A function of some instant messaging applications whereby a user may post a message that appears automatically to other users if they attempt to make contact, and he or she is not available. It is analogous to the voice message in an answering machine or voice mail system. However, away messages are often updated much more frequently than messages in answering machines, and thus may serve as a means of instant, limited &quot;publication&quot; or indirect communication. Away messages are stored on the local hard drive, so if there are multiple computers with mulitple instances of AIM, when an away message is added to one instance, AIM does not automatically update the other instances. (Advanced users may want to check out the [http://www.aim.com/help_faq/using/win/away.adp?aolp=#backup FAQs] to see how to export away messages from the registry.)
* '''[[Buddy List]]:''' The centerpiece of AIM, a list containing the status of up to 500 buddies stored on an AIM server so you can access this list from any instance of AIM.  The status can be 'online', 'away', 'idle', 'mobile', or 'offline'.  
* '''[[Screen name (computing)|Screenname]]:''' Term for [[user name]] with AOL origins. These are available for free along with software downloads from [http://www.aim.com/get_aim/win/latest_win.adp AOL]
* '''[[Messaging spam|Spim]]:''' Spam over Instant messaging. The spam problem in e-mail has the potential to spread to Instant Messaging, in the form of one-line advertisements. As a closed network, AOL has been able to block most SPIM, but some still passes through to users.
* '''Warning:''' If a user feels a received instant message is inappropriate, he or she can &quot;warn&quot; the sender, which increases the sender's warning level. Warning levels reduce the rate at which users can send messages and can eventually cause a given ScreenName to be unable to sign-on for a period of time. The warning system has been controversial, with those opposing it claiming that it can be abused easily, and just as easily avoided by creating a new screenname to continue harassment. The latest changes to AIM resolve some of the abuse.
* '''Direct connection:''' AIM users can connect to each other on port 5190 and send various forms of media. However, this has security issues.
*An '''AIM Closed List''' or '''Buddies Only''' refers to the option on the AOL Instant Messenger client to allow only users on a [[Screenname|screen name]]'s [[buddy list]] to contact him/her.  This is to prevent [[harassment]] or [[spam (electronic)|spam]]ming, and is also a secure way to chat with your friends.

==AIM URI Scheme==
AOL Instant Messenger's installation process automatically installs an extra [[URI scheme]] (&quot;protocol&quot;) handler into some web browsers, so that URIs beginning &quot;&lt;tt&gt;aim:&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; can open a new AIM window with specified parameters. This is similar in function to the &lt;tt&gt;mailto:&lt;/tt&gt; URI scheme, which creates a new e-mail message using the system's default mail program. For instance, a web page might include a link like the following in its HTML source to open a window for sending a message to the AIM user ''notarealuser'':
 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;'''aim:goim?screenname=notarealuser'''&quot;&amp;gt;Send Message&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

To specify a message body, the &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; parameter is used, so that the link location might look like this:
 &lt;code&gt;aim:goim?screenname=notarealuser&amp;message=This+is+my+message&lt;/code&gt;

==Spyware/Adware/Viruses==
[[Viewpoint Media Player]] is a program that is installed during the installation of AOL Instant Messenger that is a [[plugin]] for displaying graphical content in the software's own proprietary format. According to the software's [[end user license agreement]], Viewpoint Media Player collects usage information and forwards it to Viewpoint servers. Each installation of Viewpoint Media Player contains a unique alphanumeric identification number that can be used to uniquely identify an installation of the software.

A successful attempt to remove Viewpoint Media Player while AOL Instant Messenger is still installed will cause AOL Instant Messenger to reinstall Viewpoint Media Player the next time AOL Instant Messenger is run.

Since the AOL Instant Messenger protocols do not require the AOL Instant Messenger program, users that are concerned about Spyware/Adware are free to check out other client programs and avoid AOL's software altogether. Many full featured instant messenger applications, such as [[Gaim]] and [[Trillian (instant messenger)|Trillian]], offer no-cost (and with Gaim, open source) instant messaging applications and do not contain any advertising or spyware.

However, issues do exist when using alternative clients. Both Gaim and Trillian have trouble transferring files between Linux and Windows.

Recently, AOL Instant Messenger has suffered from an influx of viruses and trojans, which are transmitted when a user clicks a malicious link. When a user is affected, the link may be inserted into the user's profile or away message, with no way in which to remove it. The worst case is when the trojan causes the user to automatically send messages containing the malicious link to people on the user's buddy list in an instant message conversation window. These links are often well disguised as links to pictures of the user (ie: &quot;Click here to see pics of me from vacation!&quot; or &quot;Is this ''you?''&quot;) and since the messages are coming from a user's friend, they assume them to be authentic links. Some of these links will automatically download a malicious .com file to the user's computer, thus infecting it. 

However, users can avoid these problems by practicing discretion when clicking any links on AOL Instant Messenger, whether in away messages, profiles, or conversations. If a user were to hold his/her cursor over the link for a second or two, the URL of the link would be displayed. Some of these malicious links are obvious just from the URL alone, as some messages claim to show someone pictures of a user, yet do not end with a .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, .html, .htm, etc. extension. To prevent AOL from being liable for such infections, the window of a user's profile now states &quot;Warning: Links may contain viruses or trojans.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the [[theory of computation]], the '''Ackermann function''' or '''Ackermann-Péter function''' is a simple example of a [[recursive function]] that is not [[Primitive recursive function|primitively recursive]]. It takes two [[natural number]]s as arguments and yields another natural number. Its value grows extremely quickly; even for small inputs, for example (''4,3''), the values of the Ackermann function become so large that they cannot be feasibly computed, and in fact their decimal expansions require more digits than there are [[Elementary_particle|particle]]s in the entire physical universe.

==History==
In the late 1920s, the mathematicians [[Gabriel Sudan]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]], students of [[David Hilbert]], were studying the foundations of computation. Sudan is credited with inventing the lesser-known [[Sudan function]], the first published function that is recursive but not primitive-recursive. Shortly afterwards and independently, in 1928, Ackermann published his own recursive but non-primitive recursive function.[http://groups.google.com/group/soc.culture.romanian/tree/browse_frm/thread/7f684f8bd7f3edb1/]

Ackermann originally considered a function ''A''(''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') of three variables, the ''p''-fold iterated exponentiation of ''m'' with ''n'', or ''m''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''p'' as expressed using the [[Conway chained arrow]]. When ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, this is ''m''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which is ''m'' multiplied by itself ''n'' times. When ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, it is a tower of exponents &lt;math&gt;{{m^m}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^m}}}}&lt;/math&gt; with ''n'' levels, or ''m'' raised ''n'' times to the power ''m'' also written as &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''m'', the [[tetration]] of ''m'' with ''n''. We can continue to generalize this indefinitely as ''p'' becomes larger.

Ackermann proved that ''A'' is a recursive function, a function a computer with unbounded memory can calculate, but it is not a [[primitive recursive function]], a class of functions including almost all familiar functions such as addition and [[factorial]]. 

In [[#vonHeijenoort|''On the Infinite'']], [[David Hilbert]] hypothesized that the Ackermann function was not primitively recursive, but it was Ackermann, a former student and Hilbert’s personal secretary, who actually proved the hypothesis in his paper [[#vonHeijenoort|''On Hilbert’s Construction of the Real Numbers'']]. ''On the Infinite'' was Hilbert’s most important paper on the foundations of mathematics, serving as the heart of [[#Hilbert|Hilbert's program]] to secure the foundation of transfinite numbers by basing them on finite methods. The paper also outlines a proof of the [[continuum hypothesis]] and is central in influencing [[Kurt Gödel]] to study the [[#vonHeijenoort|completeness and consistency of mathematics]] leading to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]].

A similar function of only two variables was later defined by [[Rozsa Peter]] and [[Raphael Robinson]]; its definition is given below. The numbers, except in the first few rows, are three less than powers of two. For the exact relation between the two functions, see below.

==Definition and properties==
The Ackermann function is defined [[recursion|recursively]] for non-negative integers ''m'' and ''n'' as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; A(m, n) = 
  \begin{cases}
     n+1 &amp; \mbox{if } m = 0 \\
     A(m-1, 1) &amp; \mbox{if } m &gt; 0 \mbox{ and } n = 0 \\
     A(m-1, A(m, n-1)) &amp; \mbox{if } m &gt; 0 \mbox{ and } n &gt; 0.
  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Ackermann function can be calculated by a simple function based directly on the definition:

  '''function''' ack(m, n)
      '''if''' m = 0
          '''return''' n+1
      '''else if''' n = 0
          '''return''' ack(m-1, 1)
      '''else'''
          '''return''' ack(m-1, ack(m, n-1))

[[Haskell programming language|Haskell]] yields a more concise definition:

  ack 0 n = n + 1
  ack m 0 = ack (m - 1) 1
  ack m n = ack (m - 1) (ack m (n - 1))

It may be surprising that these functions always return a value. This is because at each step either ''n'' decreases, or ''n'' increases and ''m'' decreases. Each time that ''n'' reaches zero, ''m'' must decrease, so ''m'' must eventually reach zero as well.  However, when ''m'' decreases there is no upper bound on how much ''n'' can increase — and it will often increase greatly.  

The Ackermann function can also be expressed nonrecursively using [[Conway chained arrow]]:

:''A''(''m'', ''n'') = (2 → (''n''+3) → ''(m'' &amp;minus; 2)) &amp;minus; 3 for ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2

hence

:2 → ''n'' → ''m'' = ''A''(''m''+2,''n''-3) + 3 for ''n''&gt;2

(''n''=1 and ''n''=2 would correspond with ''A''(''m'',&amp;minus;2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1 and ''A''(''m'',&amp;minus;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, which could logically be added).

or the [[hyper operator]]s:

:''A''(''m'', ''n'') = hyper(2, m, n + 3) &amp;minus; 3.

For small values of ''m'' like 1, 2, or 3, the Ackermann function grows relatively slowly with respect to ''n'' (at most [[exponential growth|exponentially]]). For ''m'' &amp;ge; 4, however, it grows much more quickly; even ''A''(4,&amp;nbsp;2) is about 2&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;19728&lt;/sup&gt;, and the decimal expansion of ''A''(4,&amp;nbsp;3) cannot be recorded in the physical universe. If we define the function ''f''&amp;nbsp;(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n''), which increases both ''m'' and ''n'' at the same time, we have a function of one variable that dwarfs every [[primitive recursive function]], including very fast-growing functions such as the [[exponential function]], the [[factorial]] function, multi- and superfactorial functions, and even functions defined using [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] (except when the indexed up-arrow is used).

This extreme growth can be exploited to show that ''f'', which is obviously computable on a machine with infinite memory such as a [[Turing machine]] and so is a [[recursive function]], grows faster than any [[primitive recursive function]] and is therefore not primitive recursive. In combination with the Ackermann function's applications in analysis of algorithms, discussed later, this debunks the theory that all useful or simple functions are primitive recursive functions. (But that is not the end of this line of thought: The [[Busy beaver]] functions grow faster than any recursive function, and indeed it can be shown that if they could be evaluated in general, we could solve the [[halting problem]] so such evaluation is impossible.)

One surprising aspect of the Ackermann function is that the only arithmetic operations it ever uses are addition and subtraction of 1. Its properties come solely from the power of unlimited [[recursion]]. This also implies that its running time is at least proportional to its output, and so is also extremely huge. In actuality, for most cases the running time is far larger than the output; see below.

==Table of values==
Computing the Ackermann function can be restated in terms of an infinite table. We place the natural numbers along the top row. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left, then look up the required number in the previous row, at the position given by the number just taken. If there is no number to its left, simply look at column 1 in the previous row. Here is a small upper-left portion of the table:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ Values of ''A''(''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'')
|-
! ''m''\''n''
! 0
! 1
! 2
! 3
! 4
! n
|-
! 0
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || &lt;math&gt;n + 1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 1
| 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || &lt;math&gt;2+(n+3)-3&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 2
| 3 || 5 || 7 || 9 || 11 || &lt;math&gt;2\cdot(n + 3)-3&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 3
| 5 || 13 || 29 || 61 || 125 || &lt;math&gt;2^{(n+3)} - 3&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 4
| 13 || 65533
| 2&lt;sup&gt;65536&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3
| ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;65536&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3)
| ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;''A''(4,&amp;nbsp;3))
| &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\underbrace{{2^2}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^2}}}} - 3 \\n\mbox{ + 3 twos}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 5
| 65533 || ''A''(4,&amp;nbsp;65533) || ''A''(4,&amp;nbsp;''A''(5,&amp;nbsp;1))
| ''A''(4,&amp;nbsp;''A''(5,&amp;nbsp;2)) || ''A''(4,&amp;nbsp;''A''(5,&amp;nbsp;3))
|-
! 6
| ''A''(5,&amp;nbsp;1) || ''A''(5,&amp;nbsp;''A''(5,&amp;nbsp;1))
| ''A''(5,&amp;nbsp;A(6,&amp;nbsp;1))
| ''A''(5,&amp;nbsp;''A''(6,&amp;nbsp;2)) || ''A''(5,&amp;nbsp;''A''(6,&amp;nbsp;3))
|}

''A''(4,&amp;nbsp;2) is greater than the number of particles in the universe raised to the power 200. ''A''(5,&amp;nbsp;2) is the item at column ''A''(5,&amp;nbsp;1) in the ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 row, and cannot be written as a decimal expansion in the physical universe.  Beyond row 4 and column 1, the values can no longer be feasibly written with any standard notation other than the Ackermann function itself — writing them as decimal expansions, or even as references to rows with lower ''m'', is not possible.  

If you were able to expand every particle in the universe to a universe the size of ours by snapping your fingers, and likewise with all the particles in the created universes, and did this repeatedly, you would die of old age before the number of particles reached A(4,&amp;nbsp;3). A(5,&amp;nbsp;1) is larger than even this number.  

Despite the inconceivably large values occurring in this early section of the table, some even larger numbers have been defined, such as [[Graham's number]], which cannot be written with any small (or, indeed, recordable) number of [[Knuth's up-arrow notation|Knuth arrow]]s. This number is constructed with a technique similar to applying the Ackermann function to itself recursively. Extending the table further to overcome it is like trying the same with the list of natural numbers.

==Explanation==
To see how the Ackermann function grows so quickly, it helps to expand out some simple expressions using the rules in the original definition. For example, we can fully evaluate ''A''(1,&amp;nbsp;2) in the following way:
&lt;pre&gt; 
A(1, 2) = A(0, A(1,1))
        = A(0, A(0, A(1,0)))
        = A(0, A(0, A(0,1)))
        = A(0, A(0, 2))
        = A(0, 3)
        = 4
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now let us attempt the more complex ''A''(4,&amp;nbsp;3), the first value with fairly small ''n'' which cannot be recorded as a decimal expansion in the physical universe:
&lt;pre&gt;
A(4, 3) = A(3, A(4, 2))
        = A(3, A(3, A(4, 1)))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(4, 0))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(3, 1))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(3, 0)))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(2, 1)))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(2, 0))))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(1, 1))))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, A(1, 0)))))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, A(0, 1)))))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, 2))))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, 3)))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(1, 2))))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(1, 1)))))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, A(1, 0))))))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, A(0, 1))))))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, 2))))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, 3)))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, 4)))))
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, 5))))
        = ...
        = A(3, A(3, A(3, 13)))
        = ...
        = A(3, A(3, 65533))
        = ...
&lt;/pre&gt;

We stop here because ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;65533) returns 2&lt;sup&gt;65536&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3, a number which is much larger than the number of atoms in the visible universe.  After this, ''this'' number is itself raised as a power of 2 to obtain the final result.

==Inverse==
Since the function &amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') considered above grows very rapidly, its [[inverse function]], ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, grows very slowly.  This '''inverse Ackermann function''' ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; is usually denoted by &amp;alpha;. In fact, &amp;alpha;(n) is less than 5 for any conceivable input size ''n'', since A(4,&amp;nbsp;4) has a number of digits that cannot itself be written in binary in the physical universe.  For all practical purposes, ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') can be regarded as being a constant.

This inverse appears in the time [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] of some [[algorithm]]s, such as the [[disjoint-set data structure]] and Chazelle's algorithm for [[minimum spanning tree]]s. Sometimes Ackermann's original function or other variations are used in these settings, but they all grow at similarly high rates.  In particular, some modified functions simplify the expression by eliminating the ''&amp;minus;3'' and similar terms.

A two-parameter variation of the inverse Ackermann function can be defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(m,n) = \min\{i \geq 1 : A(i,\lfloor m/n \rfloor) \geq \log_2 n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This function arises in more precise analyses of the algorithms mentioned above, and gives a more refined time bound.  In the [[disjoint-set data structure]], ''m'' represents the number of operations while ''n'' represents the number of elements; in the [[minimum spanning tree]] algorithm, ''m'' represents the number of edges while ''n'' represents the number of vertices.
Several slightly different definitions of &amp;alpha;(''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') exist; for example, log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'' is sometimes replaced by ''n'', and the [[floor function]] is sometimes replaced by a [[ceiling function|ceiling]].

==Use as benchmark==
The Ackermann function, due to its definition in terms of extremely deep [[recursion]], can be used as a benchmark of a [[compiler]]'s ability to optimize [[recursion]]. The Computer Language Shootout, for example, compares the amount of time required to evaluate this function for fixed arguments in many different programming language implementations[http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/benchmark.php?test=ackermann&amp;lang=all&amp;sort=fullcpu].

For example, a compiler which, in analyzing the computation of ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;30), is able to save intermediate values like the ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;''n'') and ''A''(2,&amp;nbsp;''n'') in that calculation rather than recomputing them, can speed up computation of ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;30) by a factor of hundreds of thousands.  Also, if ''A''(2,&amp;nbsp;''n'') is computed directly rather than as a recursive expansion of the form ''A''(1,&amp;nbsp;''A''(1,&amp;nbsp;''A''(1,...''A''(1,&amp;nbsp;0)...))), this will save significant amounts of time.  Computing ''A''(1,&amp;nbsp;''n'') takes linear time in ''n''.  Computing ''A''(2,&amp;nbsp;''n'') requires quadratic time, since it expands to [[Big O notation|O]](''n'') nested calls to ''A''(1,&amp;nbsp;''i'') for various ''i''.  Computing ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;''n'') requires time proportionate to 4&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.  The computation of ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;1) in the example above takes 16 (4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) steps.  

''A''(4,&amp;nbsp;2), which appears as a decimal expansion in several web pages, cannot possibly be computed by recursive application of the Ackermann function in any even remotely plausible amount of time. Instead, formulas such as ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;''n'') = 8&amp;times;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus;3 are used to quickly complete some of the recursive calls.

The '''Albanians''' are an [[ethnic group]] generally associated with [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and the [[Albanian language]]. The majority of the Albanians nowadays live in the [[Albania|Republic of Albania]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Republic of Macedonia]] although there are Albanian minorities or immigrant communities in a number of other countries.

==Population==
Due to the high rate of migration of various ethnic groups throughout the [[Balkans]] in the last two decades, exact figures are difficult to obtain. A tenuous breakdown of Albanians by location is as follows:
*3,385,000 in [[Albania]] according to CIA factbook
*2,112,000 in [[Kosovo]] (the OSCE estimates)
*98,000 in [[Serbia and Montenegro]] which can be broken up as follows:
**67,000 [[Serbia]] ([[2002]] census)
**31,000 in [[Montenegro]] (according to the 2003 census; an estimated 50,000 by [http://www.albanian.com/information/countries/montenegro/index.html Albanian accounts]).
*509,000 in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] (from the 2002 census).
*more than 233,000 [http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=68624 Albanians in Italy], the majority having arrived since 1991. See also [[Arbëreshë]].
*In [[Greece]], there were more waves of immigration from Albania, from the [[14th century]] to the [[1990s]]. As such, they are divided into different groups:
**[[Cham Albanians]]; an unknown number reside in the Greek region of [[Epirus]] (''Çamëria'' in Albanian) - there were thought to be around 19,000 before the end of [[World War II]], during which many fled to Albania to avoid the impending military court sentences, a consequence of their collaboration with the Italian/German occupying forces.
**The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] Albanian minority, which is located in North-western Greece. Their number is contested, but is a minimum of 30,000.
**[[Aromanians]] or ''Arvanitovlachs'' who now self-identify as Greek, from centuries-old migrations in the Ottoman period into the region now known as Greece.
**Albanian nationals who arrived during the [[1990s]], mainly as illegal immigrants; there are as many as 700.000 [of which up to 200.000 are documented as ethnic Greeks] according to the only official state report on immigration data [http://www.mmo.gr/pdf/general/IMEPO_Final_Report_English.pdf Statistical Data on Immigrants  in Greece]
*Albanians living permanently in [[Scandinavia]]:
**in [[Sweden]]: 40,000 Albanians.
**in [[Denmark]]: 8,000 Albanians.
**in [[Norway]]: 7,000 Albanians.
*In [[Turkey]], Turkish demographers have continuously mentioned numbers up to five million. However, many Albanians, who were deported from their land to Turkey, have been assimilated due to the assimilation policy of Turkish government.  Turkey does not compile official census figures for Albanians.
*In [[Egypt]]: 18,000 Albanians.  Mostly Tosk speakers. Many are descendants of the soldiers of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]].  Much of the former nobility of Egypt was Albanian in origin.
*In the [[United States]] 114,000 Albanians, according to the [http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf 2000 US Census(PDF)]; includes Albanians coming from Albania only.

==Culture==
===Contribution to humanity===
Albanians have played a prominent role in the development of the [[The Arts|arts]] and [[sciences]] as well as in [[religion]] and [[sport]]. Prominent individuals have included the defender of Europe during the mid-15th century [[Skenderbeg]], the writer [[Ismail Kadare]], the painter [[Ibrahim Kodra]], the composer [[Simon Gjoni]], the [[Nobel prize]] winner [[Ferid Murad]], the Olympic athlete [[Klodiana Shala]], the [[Roman Catholic]] missionary [[Mother Teresa]] and [[Pope Clement XI]].Other well known individuals include the prime minister of the [[Ottoman Empire]] [[Ferhat Pasha]] and [[Mehemet Ali (Egypt)|Mehemet Ali]] the [[viceroy]] of [[Egypt]]. [[John Belushi]] and his brother [[Jim Belushi]] were of Albanian parents who immigrated in the USA after WWII. The American actress [[Eliza Dushku]] is also born of Albanian father and Norwegian mother.

===Language===
Most Albanians speak the [[Albanian language]], a member of the [[Indo-European]] language family. There are several variants of Albanian. The two main Albanian variants are Tosk and Gheg.
Some members of the Albanian diaspora do not speak the language (mostly in the US, Canada and UK) but are still considered Albanian by ethnic origin or descent.
Non-Albanians who studied the [[Albanian language]] include prominent individuals such as [[Franz Bopp]], [[Norbert Jokl]] and [[Robert Elsie]].

===Religion===
Since the occupation by the Ottomans, the majority of Albanians have been [[Islam|Muslim]]. Most of these are [[Sunni]] Muslims but a minority (20% of total Muslims) are [[Bektashi]]. Significant numbers of Albanians are [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian Orthodox]] or [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and some have no formal religious affiliation. This rich blend of religions has rarely caused religious strife and fanaticism and today people of different religions are intermarrying without it being much of an issue. For most of its history, Albania has had a noticeable Jewish community. Most of this community was saved by the Albanian people during the Nazi occupation [http://www.juedisches-archiv-chfrank.de/kehilot/albania/alban-resc.htm]. The majority of Albanian Jews have left to settle in Israel, but a small number still remains [http://www.amyisrael.co.il/europe/albania/].

===Symbolism===
[[Image:Flag_of_Albania.svg|right|150px|thumb|Albanian flag]]
The [[flag of Albania]] depicts a double-headed [[eagle]] on a red backgound, which was raised by the Albanian national hero [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]] in his Albanian rebellion against the Ottoman Turks. The Albanians are called ''Shqiptarët'' (originally ''Shqyptarët'') in the [[Albanian language]], which freely translates as &quot;The Sons of Eagles&quot;.

==History==
The Albanians are descendents of ancient Balkan people, but the exact identification is still under debate, see [[Origin of Albanians]]. Most historians and linguists support either an [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] or [[Daco]]-[[Thracian]] origin. They were first mentioned in the Balkans in 1043 AD. [[Islam]] replaced [[Christianity]] as the majority religion during the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkish rule from the [[15th century]] until 1912, though [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] and [[Catholicism|Roman Catholicism]] are also practiced. Among the poorest of Europe's nationalities, in the latter half of the [[20th century]] Albanians experienced the highest rate of natural population growth of any of [[Europe]]'s major indigenous ethnic groups, increasing their numbers from 1.5 million around 1900 and fewer than 2.5 million in 1950.

==Ethnic Albanians==
Albanian is also a term often given to what would otherwise be called an ethnic Albanian. This is usually someone who is considered by himself or others to be Albanian or of Albanian descent. Several distinguishing characteristics might be:

* Cultural connection with [[Culture of Albania|Albanian culture]]
* Speaking the [[Albanian language]]
* Having ancestors who lived in Albania or an area out of which the current Albanian state was formed (i.e. the occupied lands that were part of the [[Ottoman Empire]])

There are ethnic Albanian minorities in several [[Europe]]an countries, as well as in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Russia]] and  [[Ukraine]].

==Albanian Nationalism==
Both Kosovo (a [[Serbia]]n province though governed since June 1999 by [[UNMIK]], backed by [[KFOR]], a [[NATO]]-led international force) and western Macedonia have in recent years seen armed movements ([[Kosovo Liberation Army]], [[UCPMB]], [[Macedonian NLA]]) aiming either for independence, greater autonomy, or increased human and political rights.

The fate of Kosovo remains uncertain owing to the reluctance of the Albanian majority to contemplate a restoration of Serbian sovereignty and of the [[United Nations]] and NATO to separate the territory definitively from [[Serbia]] in contravention of [[:Wikisource:UN Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244]] from 1999.

The situation in Macedonia seems to have been resolved by giving the Albanian minority greater government representation and the right to use the [[Albanian language]] in education and government.

The '''Association for Computing Machinery''', or '''ACM''', was founded in [[1947]] as the world's first scientific and educational [[computing]] society.  Its membership is currently around 78,000.  Its headquarters are in [[New York City]].

== Activities ==
ACM is organized into over 170 local chapters and 34 [[special interest group]]s ([[SIG]]s), through which it conducts most of its activities.  Additionally, there are over 500 college and university [http://www.acm.org/chapters/stu/ chapters]. The first student chapter was founded in 1961 at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]].

Many of the SIGs, like [[ACM SIGGRAPH|SIGGRAPH]], [[SIGPLAN]] and [[SIGCOMM]], sponsor regular conferences which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting new innovations in certain fields.  The SIGs also publish a large number of specialized journals, magazines, and newsletters.

ACM also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]] (ICPC), and has sponsored some other very mentionable events such as the chess match between Garry Kasparov and the [[IBM Deep Blue]] computer.

== Services ==
ACM Press publishes a prestigious academic journal, 
&lt;span id=&quot;jacm&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!-- when there is a separate JACM article, this anchor can go away --&gt;
''[[Journal of the ACM]]'', and general magazines for computer professionals, ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' and ''[[ACM Queue|Queue]]''.  Additionally, it publishes the most popular student computing journal in the country, [[ACM Crossroads]] as well as the prestigious computer graphics journal ''[[ACM Transactions on Graphics]]''. Many of the great debates in the history of computing have taken place in the pages of ''Communications.'' Examples include the famous &quot;[[GOTO]] considered harmful&quot; letter, the issue of what to call the then-fledgling field of [[computer science]], and the issue of changing ACM's name (since the &quot;machinery&quot; in question is no longer the size of a house and is now measured in micrometres).  All three attempts at changing ACM's name have failed.

ACM has made almost all of its publications available online at its [http://portal.acm.org/dl.cfm Digital Library] and also has a [http://portal.acm.org/guide.cfm Guide to Computing Literature]. It also offers insurance and other services to its members.

== Digital Library ==
ACM has created a digital library where it has made all of its publications available. ACM’s digital library is the world’s largest collection of information on computing machinery and contains an archive of journals, magazines, conference proceedings online, and the recent issues of ACM’s publications. Online services include a forum called Ubiquity and Tech News digest, both containing the latest information about the IT world.

== Competition ==
ACM's primary competitor is the [[IEEE Computer Society]].  It is difficult to generalize accurately about the distinction between the two, but ACM focuses on theoretical [[computer science]] and end-user applications while IEEE focuses more on hardware and standardization issues.  Another blunt way to state the difference is that ACM is for [[computer science|computer scientists]] and IEEE is for [[electrical engineering|electrical engineers]], although the largest IEEE subgroup is its Computer Society.  Of course, there is significant overlap between the two organizations, and they occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computer science curricula.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anabaptists''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''ana''+''baptizo'' &quot;re-baptizers&quot;, [[German language|German]]: '''Wiedertäufer''') were [[Christianity|Christian]]s of the [[Radical Reformation]]. The term was coined by critics, who objected to the Anabaptist practice of rebaptizing adults who had previously been baptized as infants. Anabaptists believed [[infant baptism]] was not valid. Various groups at various times have been called ''Anabaptist'', but this article focuses primarily on the ''Anabaptists'' of [[16th century]] [[Europe]].

[[Image:Thomas Muentzer.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Thomas Muentzer]] was one of the founders of the '''Anabaptist''' movement.]]

==Designation and definition==
The present concept and idea of ''Anabaptism'' or ''rebaptism'' has existed at least since the [[2nd century]], and some Anabaptists also point to the [[1st century]] example of the [[Apostle Paul]] in Acts chapter 19. Montanus, the [[Montanist]]s, and [[Tertullian]] (2nd and 3rd centuries) denied [[infant baptism]], practiced [[believers baptism|believer's baptism]], and ''rebaptized'' those baptized by heretics. The [[Donatists]] ([[4th century]]) re-baptized those who had been baptized by bishops who were [[traditors]], or who were from churches stained by fellowship with ''traditors''{{ref|traditor}}. Anabaptists (rebaptizers) were made criminals under the [[code of Justinian]] (A.D. [[529]]). With anti-trinitarianism, it was one of two 'heresies' or schisms,  punishable by death because of its political implications.

Their enemies and opposers gave Anabaptists their name; it is a term that means &quot;rebaptizers.&quot; Nevertheless, the Anabaptists did not think of believer's baptism as &quot;rebaptism&quot;. They did not recognize infant baptism as properly administered the first time. Though the main Anabaptist groups disagreed with few important Protestant doctrines, even the Protestants called them heretics. Zwingli called them Wiedertäufer (Dutch, ''Wederdooper''; Latin, ''Anabaptistae''), ''Täufer'' (Dutch, ''Dooper'' or ''Doopsgezinden''), and ''Catabaptistae'' (drowners{{ref|catab}}). Luther called them ''Schwärmer'' (fanatics, enthusiasts). They have also been known as ''Bolsheveki'' and &quot;''Stepchildren of the Reformation''&quot;. The most common names the Anabaptists used for themselves were brethren, believers and Christians.

The word Anabaptism may be used to describe a Protestant group baptizing Christians who were baptized in infancy and/or who come to them from other bodies, any of the 16th century &quot;radical&quot; dissenters, or the denominations descending from the followers of [[Menno Simons]]. The use of the term Anabaptism does not necessarily imply claims to uniformity between the groups thus denominated. Today the descendants of the [[16th century]] European movement (particularly the [[Amish]], [[Hutterite]]s, &amp; [[Mennonite]]s) are the most common bodies referred to as Anabaptist. Yet other bodies (such as the early English Baptists) were also referred to by their enemies as Anabaptists, and are clearly Anabaptists in the generally accepted sense of the term. The majority of [[Baptist]]s further engage in a practice others consider &quot;rebaptizing&quot; in that they usually ''re''baptize even adult believers who were baptized by some mode other than immersion or who had not had a &quot;believers' baptism&quot;. Christian church historians generally believe that there is no historical continuity between anabaptists in the first few centuries of Christianity and later anabaptist groups.

==Anabaptist origins==
===Forerunners===
Though the majority opinion is that Anabaptists began with the Radical Reformers in the 16th century, certain people and groups may still legitimately be considered their forerunners. [[Peter Chelcicky]], [[15th century]] [[Bohemia]]n ''Reformer'', taught most of the beliefs considered integral to Anabaptist theology. Medieval antecedents may include the ''Brethren of the Common Life'', the [[Hussite]]s, and some forms of monasticism. The [[Waldensian]]s also represent a faith similar to the Anabaptists.

In the following points Anabaptists resembled the medieval dissenters:
# Some followed [[Menno Simons]] in teaching that Jesus did not take the flesh from his mother, but either brought his body from heaven or had one made for him by the Word.  Some even said that he passed through his mother, as water through a pipe, into the world.  In pictures and sculptures of the 15th century and earlier, we often find represented this idea, originated by [[Marcion]] in the [[2nd century]].  The Anabaptists were accused of denying the [[Incarnation]] of Christ: a charge that Menno Simons repeatedly rejected. 
# They condemned oaths, and also the reference of disputes between believers to law-courts. 
# The believer must not bear arms or offer forcible resistance to wrongdoers, nor wield the sword.  No Christian has the [[jus gladii]]. 
# Civil government (i.e. &quot;[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]&quot;) belongs to the world.  The believer, who belongs to God's kingdom, must not fill any office, nor hold any rank under government, which is to be passively obeyed. 
# Sinners or unfaithful ones are to be excommunicated, and excluded from the sacraments and from intercourse with believers unless they repent, according to Matt.18:15 seq.  But no force is to be used towards them. 

Some sects calling themselves [[Spirituales]] or [[Perfecti]] also held that the baptized cannot sin, a very ancient tenet. 

They seem to have preserved among them the primitive manual called the Teaching of the Apostles, for Bishop Longland in [[England]] condemned an Anabaptist for repeating one of its maxims &quot;that alms should not be given before they did sweat in a man's hand.&quot; This was between 1518 and 1521.

===Views of origins===
Research on the origins of the Anabaptists has been tainted both by the attempts of their enemies to slander them, and the attempts of their friends to vindicate them. It was long popular to simply lump all Anabaptists as Munsterites and radicals associated with the [[Zwickau]] Prophets, [[Jan Matthys]], [[John of Leiden]] (also Jan Bockelson van Leiden, Jan of Leyden), and [[Thomas Muentzer]]. Those desiring to correct this error tended to over-correct and deny all connections between the larger Anabaptist movement and this most radical element.

The modern era of Anabaptist historiography arose with the work of Roman Catholic scholar [[Carl Adolf Cornelius]]' publication of ''Die Geschichte des Münsterischen Aufruhrs'' in 1855. Baptist historian [[Albert Henry Newman]] (1852-1933), whom Bender said occupied &quot;first position in the field of American Anabaptist Historiography&quot;, made a major contribution with his ''A History of Anti-Pedobaptism''. Though a number of theories exist concerning origins, the three main ideas are that,

# Anabaptists began in a single expression in Zürich and spread from there (Monogenesis), 
# Anabaptists began through several independent movements ([[polygenism|polygenesis]]), and 
# Anabaptists are a continuation of New Testament Christianity (apostolic succession or church perpetuity).   

====Monogenesis====
A number of scholars (e.g. Bender, Estep, Friedmann) have seen all the Anabaptists as rising out of the Swiss Brethren movement of [[Conrad Grebel]], [[Felix Manz]], [[Georg Blaurock]], et al. The older view among Mennonite historians generally held that Anabaptism had its origins in [[Zürich]], and that the Anabaptism of the Swiss Brethren was transmitted to South Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and North Germany, where it developed into its various branches. The monogenesis theory usually rejects the Münsterites and other radicals from the category of true Anabaptists. In this view the time of origin is [[January 21]], [[1525]], when Grebel baptized Georg Blaurock, and Blaurock baptized other followers. This remains the most popular single time posited for the establishment of Anabaptism. But in the last quarter of the [[20th century]], Deppermann, Packull, and others suggested that [[February 24]], [[1527]] at Schleitheim is the proper date of the origin of Anabaptism. This correlates with the following polygenesis theory.

====Polygenesis====
[[James M. Stayer]], [[Werner O. Packull]], and [[Klaus Deppermann]] disputed the idea of a single origin of Anabaptists in a 1975 essay entitled &quot;From Monogenesis to Polygenesis&quot;. That article, emphasizing distinctive characteristics and distinct sources, has become a widely accepted treatment of the plural origins of Anabaptism. According to these authors, South German-Austrian Anabaptism &quot;was a diluted form of [[Rhineland]] mysticism,&quot; Swiss Anabaptism &quot;arose out of Reformed [[congregationalism]]&quot;, and Dutch Anabaptism was formed by &quot;Social unrest and the apocalyptic visions of [[Melchior Hoffman]]&quot;. Pilgram Marpeck's ''Vermanung'' of 1542 was deeply influenced by the ''Bekenntnisse'' of 1533 by Münster theologian [[Bernhard Rothmann]]. The Hutterites used Melchior Hoffman's commentary on the Apocalypse shortly after he wrote it. [[David Joris]], a disciple of Hoffman, was the most important Anabaptist leader in the Netherlands before 1540. Grete Mecenseffy and Walter Klaassen established links between Thomas Muentzer and Hans Hut, and the work of Gottfried Seebaß and Werner Packull clearly showed the influence of Thomas Muentzer on the formation of South German Anabaptism. Steven Ozment's work linked [[Hans Denck]] and [[Hans Hut]] with Thomas Muentzer, [[Sebastian Franck]], and others. Calvin Pater has shown that [[Andreas Karlstadt]] influenced Swiss Anabaptism in areas including his view of Scripture, doctrine of the church, and views on baptism.

====Apostolic succession====
{{main|Theology of Anabaptism}}
Another theory is that the 16th century Anabaptists were part of an [[apostolic succession]] of churches (or ''church perpetuity'') from the time of Christ. According to this idea there had been a continuity of small groups outside the [[Roman Catholic Church]] from A.D. [[30]] to 1525 (which continues also to the present). Proponents of this view point out many common expressions of belief in these Catholic dissenters. The opponents of this theory emphasize that these non-Catholic groups differed from each other, that they held some heretical views, and/or that they had no connection with one another. This view is held by some Baptists, some Mennonites, and a number of &quot;true church&quot; movements.{{ref|true}} The writings of [[John T. Christian]], [[New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary]] professor, contain perhaps the best scholarly presentation of this successionist view. Somewhat related to this is that the Anabaptists are of Waldensian origin. Some hold the idea that the Waldenses are part of the apostolic succession, while others simply believe they were an independent group out of whom the Anabaptists arose. Estep asserts &quot;the Waldenses disappeared in Switzerland a century before the rise of the Anabaptist movement.&quot; Ludwig Keller, Thomas M. Lindsay, H. C. Vedder, Delbert Grätz, and Thieleman van Braght all held, in varying degrees, the position that the Anabaptists were of Waldensian origin.

==Types of Anabaptists==
It is beneficial to recognize different types among the Anabaptists, although these categorizations tend to vary with the scholar's viewpoint on origins. Estep claims that in order to understand Anabaptism, one must &quot;distinguish between the Anabaptists, inspirationists, and rationalists.&quot; He classes the likes of Blaurock, Grebel, Hübmaier, Manz, Marpeck, and Simons as Anabaptists. He groups Muentzer, Storch, et al. as inspirationists, and anti-trinitarians such as [[Michael Servetus]], [[Juan de Valdes|Juan de Valdés]], [[Sebastian Castellio]], and [[Faustus Socinus]] as [[rationalism|rationalists]]. Mark S. Ritchie follows this line of thought, saying, &quot;The Anabaptists were one of several branches of 'Radical' reformers (i.e. reformers that went further than the mainstream Reformers) to arise out of the Renaissance and Reformation. Two other branches were Spirituals or Inspirationists, who believed that they had received direct revelation from the Spirit, and rationalists or anti-Trinitarians, who rebelled against traditional Christian doctrine, like Michael Servetus.&quot;

Those of the polygenesis viewpoint use ''Anabaptist'' to define the larger movement, and include the inspirationists and rationalists as true Anabaptists. James M. Stayer used the term ''Anabaptist'' for those who ''rebaptized'' persons already baptized in infancy. Walter Klaassen was perhaps the first Mennonite scholar to define ''Anabaptists'' that way in his 1960 Oxford dissertation. This represents a rejection of the previous standard held by Mennonite scholars such as Bender and Friedmann.

Another method of categorization acknowledges regional variations, such as Swiss Brethren (Grebel, Manz), Dutch Anabaptism (Menno, Philips), and South German Anabaptism (Hübmaier, Marpeck).

Historians and sociologists have made further distinctions between radical Anabaptists, who were prepared to use violence in their attempts to build a [[New Jerusalem]], and their pacifist brethren, later broadly known as [[Mennonites]]. Radical Anabaptist groups included the Münsterites, who occupied and held the German city of [[Münster]] in 1534-[[1535]], and the [[Batenburgers]], who persisted in various guises as late as the 1570s.

==Zwickau prophets and the Peasants' War==
{{main articles|[[Thomas Muentzer]] and [[Peasants' War]]}}
On [[December 27]], [[1521]], [[Zwickau prophets|three &quot;prophets&quot;]], influenced by and in turn influencing [[Thomas Muentzer]], appeared in [[Wittenberg]] from [[Zwickau]]: Thomas Dreschel, Nicolas Storch and Mark Thomas Stübner. The crisis came in the so-called Peasants' War in South [[Germany]] in 1525. In its origin a revolt against feudal oppression, it became, under the leadership of Muentzer, a war against all constituted authorities, and an attempt to establish by revolution an ideal Christian commonwealth, with absolute equality and the community of goods.

==The Münster Rebellion==
{{main articles|[[Münster Rebellion]] and [[Münster]]}}
A second and more determined attempt to establish a theocracy was made at Münster in [[Westphalia]] (1532-1535), led by [[Bernhard Rothmann]], [[Bernhard Knipperdolling]], [[Jan Matthys]] and [[John of Leiden]]. 

==Miscellany==
The first leaders of the movement in Zürich &amp;mdash; [[Conrad Grebel]], [[Felix Manz]], [[George Blaurock]], [[Balthasar Hubmaier|Balthasar Hübmaier]] &amp;mdash; were men learned in Greek, Latin and Hebrew.

In English history frequent reference is made to the Anabaptists during the [[16th century|16th]] and [[17th century | 17th centuries]], but there is no evidence that any considerable number of native Englishmen ever adopted the principles of the Münster sect.  Many of the followers of Muentzer and Bockelson seem to have fled from persecution in [[Germany]] and the Netherlands to be subjected to a [[persecution]] scarcely less severe in England.  The mildest measure adopted towards these refugees was banishment from the kingdom, and a large number suffered at the stake. Their [[Christology]] and negative attitude towards the state rather indicate, as in the case of [[John Wyclif]], [[Jan Hus]] and the [[Fraticelli]] ([[Brethren]]), an affinity to the [[Cathar|Cathars]] and other medieval sects. But this affiliation is hard to establish.

The earliest Anabaptists of Zürich allowed that the [[Picardi]] or [[Waldensian | Waldensians]] had, in contrast with [[Rome]] and the [[Reformation | Reformers]], truth on their side, yet did not claim to be in their succession; nor can it be shown that their adult baptism derived from any of the older Baptist sects, which undoubtedly lingered in parts of Europe.  Later on Hermann Schyn claimed descent for the peaceful Baptists from the Waldensians, who certainly, as the records of the Flemish [[inquisition]], collected by P. Fredericq, prove, were widespread during the 15th century over north [[France]] and Flanders.  It would appear from the way in which Anabaptism sprang up everywhere independently, as if more than one ancient sect took in and through it a new lease of life.  [[Albrecht Ritschl|Ritschl]] discerned in it the leaven of the Fraticelli or [[Franciscan Tertiaries]].

In [[Moravia]], if what Alexander Rost related be true, namely that they called themselves [[Apostel | Apostolici]], and went barefooted healing the sick, they must have at least absorbed into themselves a sect of whom we hear in the 12th century in the north of Europe as deferring baptism to the age of 30, and rejecting oaths, prayers for the dead, relics and invocation of saints.

The Moravian Anabaptists, says Rost, went bare-footed, washed each other's feet (like the Fraticelli), had all goods in common, worked everyone at a handicraft, had a spiritual father who prayed with them every morning and taught them, dressed in black and had long graces before and after meals. Zeiler also in his ''German Itinerary'' (1618) describes their way of life.  [[The Lord's Supper]], or bread-breaking, was a commemoration of the [[Passion]], held once a year. They sat at long tables, the elders read the words of institution and prayed, and passed a loaf round from which each broke off a bit and ate, the wine being handed round in flagons. Children in their colonies were separated from the parents, and lived in the school, each having his bed and blanket. They were taught reading, writing and summing, cleanliness, truthfulness and industry, and the girls married the men chosen for them.

On [[April 12]], [[1549]], certain [[London]] Anabaptists brought before a commission of bishops asserted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;That a man regenerate could not sin; that though the outward man sinned, the inward man sinned not; that there was no [[Trinity]] of Persons; that [[Christ]] was only a holy prophet and not at all God; that all we had by Christ was that he taught us the way to heaven; that he took no flesh of the Virgin, and that the baptism of infants was not profitable.&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the most notable features of the early Anabaptists is that they regarded any true religious reform as involving social amelioration. The socialism of the 16th century was necessarily Christian and Anabaptist. [[Lutheranism]] was more attractive to grand-ducal patriots and well-to-do burghers than to the poor and oppressed and disinherited. The Lutherans and Zwinglians never converted the Anabaptists.  In Austrian-controlled territories, the [[Jesuits]] had somewhat better success in persuading or coercing many [[Hutterites]] to rejoin the Roman Catholic Church.

Social scientist Robert Cialdini (see [[Mind Control]]) notes that early Anabaptists were unusual among doomsday groups because rather than disintegrating in the face of ''false'' doomsday predictions, Anabaptists were able to grow and prosper through extraordinarly effective recruitment efforts.  He notes that: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;When the Dutch Anabaptists saw their prophesied year of destruction, 1533, pass uneventfully, they became rabid seekers after converts, pouring unprecedented amounts of energy into the cause.  One extraordinarily eloquent missionary, Jakob van Kampen, is reported to have baptized 100 persons in single day.  So powerful was the snowballing social evidence in support of the Anabaptist position that it rapidly  over-whelmed the ''disconfirming'' physical evidence and turned two-thirds of Holland's great cities into adherents&quot;. &lt;/blockquote&gt;  He theorizes that groups of 'true believers' suddenly shift from secret conspirators to zealous missionaries precisely when direct disconfirmation of their beliefs renders them ''least'' convincing to ''outsiders'' because publicity and recruitment provide the only remaining hope, that, through ''social'' evidence, &quot;their threatened but treasured beliefs would become ''truer''&quot;.  Few contemporary doomsday groups are as successful as these early Anabaptists were at actually ''gaining'' new converts in the face of false physical evidence.

==Persecutions and migrations==
[[Image:Dirk.willems.rescue.ncs.jpg|thumb|Dirk Willems saves his pursuer.]]

Much historic [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] literature has represented the Anabaptists as groups who preached false doctrine and led people into apostasy. That negative historiography remained popular for about four centuries. The Catholics and Protestants alike persecuted the Anabaptists, resorted to torture and other types of physical abuse, in attempts both to curb the growth of the movement and bring about the ''salvation'' of the heretics (through recantation). The Protestants under [[Ulrich Zwingli|Zwingli]] were the first to persecute the ''Reformation'' Anabaptists. Felix Manz became the first martyr in 1527. On [[May 20]], 1527, Catholic authorities executed Michael Sattler. King Ferdinand declared drowning (called the ''third baptism'') &quot;the best antidote to Anabaptism&quot;. It has been said that a &quot;16th century man who did not drink to excess, curse, or abuse his workmen or family could be suspected of being an Anabaptist and thus persecuted.&quot; [http://www.ctlibrary.com/6274] Estep estimates that thousands died in Europe in the sixteenth century.

Thieleman J. van Braght's ''[[Martyrs Mirror]]'' describes the persecution and execution of thousands of Anabaptists, such as [[Dirk Willems]], in Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and other parts of Europe between 1525 and 1660. Continuing persecution in [[Europe]] was largely responsible for the mass immigrations to North America by Amish, Hutterites, and Mennonites.

==Anabaptists today==
Several existing denominational bodies may be legitimately regarded as the successors of the Continental Anabaptists &amp;mdash; Amish, Baptists, Brethren, Hutterites, Mennonites, Bruderhof Communities and Quakers. Some writers prefer to distinguish institutionally lineal descendants ([[Amish]], [[Hutterite]]s, [[Mennonite]]s) and spiritual descendants ([[Baptist]]s, [[Brethren]], the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof Communities]], and [[Seventh Day Adventists]]; the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] share the distinction of also being a [[peace church]]). Nevertheless, some historical connections have been demonstrated for all of these spiritual descendants, though perhaps not as clearly as the notable institutionally lineal descendants. However, although many see the more well known Anabaptist groups ([[Amish]], [[Hutterites]] and [[Mennonites]]) as ethnic groups, the Anabaptist bodies of today are largely no longer ethnically descended from the Continental Anabaptists. Total membership in Mennonite, [[Brethren in Christ]] and related churches totals 1,297,716 as of 2003 with about 60 percent in Africa, Asia and Latin America.{{ref|mwc}}

One of the historical Anabaptist doctrines &amp;mdash; that people must personally, volitionally, and consciously relate to God &amp;mdash; is a doctrine found among much of Evangelical Protestantism, even though these churches may not be historically linked to the Anabaptists.

Today in response to post-modernism, what some theologians are calling 'the end of Christendom' and the global ecological crisis, some churches and theologians are drawing upon the Anabaptist traditions as a paradigm for Christian spirituality in the 21st century.  This movement, sometimes referred to as 'neo-anabaptism', includes theologians and communities from wide diversity of Christian denominations which are not part of the Historic [[Peace Churches]], yet who see in the witness of the 16th century radical reformers an authentic witness to early Christianity and to the life and teachings of Christ.  Scholars who are sometimes identified with this line of thinking include [[Stanley Hauerwas]], Nancey Murphy, Lee Camp, Richard Hays, Craig A. Carter, James McClendon, and Michael Cartwright.  

''[[Sojourners]]'' magazine editor [[Jim Wallis]] has said that Mennonite Theologian [[John H. Yoder]] &quot;inspired a whole generation of Christians to follow the way of Jesus into social action and peacemaking.&quot;  The neo-anabaptist communities and theologians are also a direct result of this legacy. Neo-Anabaptist communities are often identifiable by their desire to live as a prophetic alternative to larger society through their commitment to Christ’s [[Sermon on the Mount]] as normative for the Christian life when empowered by the [[Holy Spirit]]. Outworkings of this spirituality include simple yet joyful lifestyle, peace and justice making, the practice of [[nonviolence]], communal living and the voluntary sharing of goods, particularly with those in need.

==The Anabaptist heritage==
*Freedom of religion
*[[Priesthood of all believers]]
*Bible as the sole rule of faith and practice
*Pacifism 
*Ordinances, not sacraments

All those who hold the idea of a free church and freedom of religion (sometimes called separation of church and state) are greatly indebted to the Anabaptists. When it was introduced by the Anabaptists in the 15th and 16th centuries, religious freedom independent of the state was a radical idea, and unthinkable to both clerical and governmental leaders. Religious liberty was equated with anarchy and Peter Kropotkin traces the birth of anarchist thought in Europe to these early Anabaptist communities. (&quot;Anarchism&quot; from The Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1910 By Peter Kropotkin)

According to Estep, &quot;Where men believe in the freedom of religion, supported by a guarantee of separation of church and state, they have entered into that heritage. Where men have caught the Anabaptist vision of discipleship, they have become worthy of that heritage. Where corporate discipleship submits itself to the New Testament pattern of the church, the heir has then entered full possession of his legacy.&quot;

[[genealogy|Genealogists]] are also indebted to the Anabaptists, because Anabaptism was part of the cause for Protestant churches adopting the confirmation service, and baptismal registers came into being.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Alaska Panhandle''' is the coast of the [[United States|American]] state of [[Alaska]], just west of the northern half of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]].  In many places, the [[international border]] runs along the crest of the [[Boundary Ranges]] of the [[Coast Mountains]] (see [[Alaska Boundary Dispute]]).

The [[Panhandle]] includes the [[Tongass National Forest]], [[Glacier Bay National Park]], [[Admiralty Island National Monument|Admiralty Island]] [[National Monument]], [[Alaska's Inside Passage]], and myriad large and small islands.  The largest islands are, from North to South, [[Chichagof Island]], [[Admiralty Island]], [[Baranof Island]], and [[Prince of Wales Island]].  Major bodies of water of the Alaska Panhandle include [[Glacier Bay]], [[Lynn Canal]], [[Icy Strait]], [[Chatham Strait]], [[Stevens Passage]], [[Fredrick Sound]], [[Summer Strait]], and [[Clarence Strait]].

Wildlife includes [[brown bear]]s, [[american Black Bear|black bears]], [[wolf|wolves]], [[Sitka deer]], [[humpback whale]]s, [[orca]]s, five species of [[salmon]], [[bald eagle]]s, [[harlequin duck]]s, [[scoter]]s, and [[Marbled Murrelet|marbled murrelet]]s.

Major cities are [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], and [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]]. Other towns are [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]], [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]], [[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]], [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], [[Hoonah, Alaska|Hoonah]], [[Angoon, Alaska|Angoon]], [[Kake, Alaska|Kake]], [[Craig, Alaska|Craig]], [[Klawock, Alaska|Klawock]], [[Yakutat, Alaska|Yakutat]], [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], and [[Gustavus, Alaska|Gustavus]]. There are also many tiny (ie, less than 100 people) towns and villages, such as [[Pelican, Alaska|Pelican]], [[Tenakee Springs, Alaska|Tenakee Springs]], [[Port Protection, Alaska|Port Protection]], [[Port Frederick, Alaska|Port Frederick]], [[Port Alexander, Alaska|Port Alexander]], [[Baranof Warm Springs, Alaska|Baranof Warm Springs]], [[Elfin Cove, Alaska|Elfin Cove]], [[Excursion Inlet, Alaska|Excursion Inlet]], [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]], and [[Meyers Chuck, Alaska|Meyers Chuck]].

This area is the traditional homeland of the [[Tlingit]] people.

On [[August 20]], [[1902]], [[President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established the Alexander Archipelago Forest Reserve, which formed the heart of the [[Tongass National Forest|Tongass]] [[National Forest]] that covers most of the region.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Interior fall.jpg|thumb|300px|Fall in Interior Alaska]]
The '''interior''' of [[Alaska]] makes up most of the state.  It is largely wild and undeveloped.

Mountains include [[Mount McKinley]] (Denali) in the [[Alaska Range]] and the [[Wrangell Mountains]].

The largest city in the interior is [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], Alaska's second-largest city, in the [[Tanana Valley]].  Other towns include [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]], just south of Fairbanks, [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]], [[Tok, Alaska|Tok]], [[Talkeetna, Alaska|Talkeetna]], [[Glennallen, Alaska|Glennallen]], [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]], [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]], [[Anderson, Alaska|Anderson]], [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] and [[Cantwell, Alaska|Cantwell]].

== Climate ==
Interior Alaska experiences seasonal temperature extremes.  Winter temperatures in Fairbanks average -25°C (-12°F) and summer temperatures average +17°C (+61°F). Temperatures there have been recorded as low as -61°C (-82°F) in mid-winter, and as high as +34°C (+101°F) in summer.

The average annual precipitation in Fairbanks is 28.7 cm (11.3 inches).  Most of this comes in the form of snow during the winter.  Most storms in the interior of Alaska originate in the [[Gulf of Alaska]], south of Alaska.

On clear winter nights, the [[aurora borealis]] can often be seen dancing in the sky.  Like all subarctic regions, the months from May to July in the summer have no night, only a twilight during the night hours. The months of November - January have little daylight.  Fairbanks receives an average 21 hours of daylight between May 10 and August 2 each summer, and an average of less than 4 hours of daylight between November 18 and January 24 each winter.

The interior of Alaska is largely underlined by discontinuous [[permafrost]], which grades to continuous permafrost as the [[Arctic Circle]] is approached.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''And did those feet in ancient time''''' is a [[poem]] by [[William Blake]] from the preface to his work ''[[Milton: a Poem]]'' ([[1804]]). Today it is best known as the [[hymn]] '''''Jerusalem''''', with [[music]] written by [[Hubert Parry|C. Hubert H. Parry]] in [[1916]]. 

The poem was published in a patriotic anthology of verse in 1916 because morale had begun to decline due to the high number of casualties in the [[First World War]] and the perception that there was no end in sight.  It was little known before then.  To many the poem seemed to define what Britain was fighting for and so Parry was asked to put it to music at a Fight for Right campaign meeting in London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. The most famous version was [[orchestration|orchestrated]] by [[Sir Edward Elgar]] in [[1922]] for the Leeds Festival.

This is considered to be one of [[England]]'s most popular [[patriotism|patriotic]] songs, often being used as an alternative anthem. It is variously associated with English [[nationalism]], [[antimodernism|anti-modernism]], [[postmodernism|post-modernism]], [[socialist]] ideals, and [[Christianity]], thereby holding a rather odd position. ''Jerusalem'' is the official anthem of the [[British National Party]] and the [[British Women's Institute]], and historically was used by the [[National Union of Suffrage Societies]].

The text of the poem was inspired by the [[legend]] that [[Jesus]], while still a young man, accompanied [[Joseph of Arimathea]] to [[Glastonbury]]. Blake's biographers tell us that he believed in this legend. However, the poem's [[Theme (literature)|theme]] or [[subtext]] is subject to much sharper debate, probably accounting for its popularity across the philosophical spectrum. As a paean to a mythical Englishness the poem has come under criticism: after all, the first verse is a series of questions to which the 'truthful' answer is no, while the second frames a series of demands to which the reply might well be &quot;get them yourself!&quot;. Consequently many see it as unsuitable as an alternate National Anthem, and its reference to a foreign capital city as puzzling to other nations. It is unlikely that Blake intended such a literal interpretation.

One particular line from the poem, &quot;Bring me my chariot of fire&quot;, which inspired the title of the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', most probably draws on the story of 2 Kings 2:11, where the Old Testament prophet [[Elijah (prophet)|Elijah]] is taken directly to heaven.  A church congregation sings &quot;Jerusalem&quot; at close of the film.  It is also sung in the film ''[[Calendar Girls]]'' at a meeting of the British Women's Institute.

The song was performed by the band [[Emerson, Lake and Palmer]] on their album ''[[Brain Salad Surgery]]'', where it appeared under the title ''Jerusalem''. [[Iron Maiden]] singer [[Bruce Dickinson]] recorded a much transformed version on his solo concept album about Blake, ''The Chemical Wedding''. [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] and [[Billy Bragg]] have also recorded versions of the song, and [[the KLF|the KLF]] (as the Jamms) used it to end &quot;It's Grim Up North&quot;. [[Composer]] [[Robert Steadman]] incorporated a version in his [[remembrance]]-themed [[choral]] work ''In Memoriam'' (premiered in [[1995]]). In [[2000]], British novelty-pop group Fat Les recorded another version, entitled ''Jerusalem'' or alternately ''Jerusalem 2000''. This time it was a rousing electronic dance track, and was used as the England football team's theme at [[Euro 2000]]. 

Jerusalem, along with [[Abide With Me]], is always sung at the [[Rugby League]] Challenge Cup Final and both songs are known as Rugby League anthems. Since 2004 it has been sung at the beginning of [[England]] [[cricket]] matches and is regularly sung by [[Rugby Union]] crowds.

The tune has been set to several texts in the United States, where the traditional lyrics would have little relevance, including ''O Love of God, how strong and true'', which was performed in an arrangement by [[Michael McCarthy (choirmaster)|Michael McCarthy]] at [[Ronald Reagan]]'s funeral at [[Washington National Cathedral]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Bush''' is a cultural as well as geographic division of the state of [[Alaska]] in the [[United States]]. Most Alaskans refer to any place besides [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Juneau City and Borough, Alaska|Juneau]], and the towns of the [[Kenai_Peninsula_Borough, Alaska|Kenai Peninsula]] and [[Matanuska-Susitna_Borough, Alaska|Mat-Su]] [[Borough|boroughs]] as falling within the Bush. The Bush is generally described as any community not &quot;on the road system,&quot; making it accessible only by such means of transportation as: Snomobile/snowmachine, plane, boat, etc.

Two kinds of Bush communities exist in Alaska: '''The Bush Hub''' and '''The Bush Village'''.

== The Bush Hub ==
These are the hub towns of a few thousand people:  [[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]], [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], [[St. Mary's, Alaska|St. Mary's]], [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], [[Unalaska, Alaska|Dutch Harbor]], and [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]. Bush hub towns tend to share a number of defining characteristics. These generally include:
*isolated road systems (roads do not connect to any other significant towns or cities).
*effects of permafrost (exposed sewage/water pipes, raised buildings, buckled roads).
*busy airports.
Hub cities are said to still have a &quot;wild west&quot; feel to them, (complete with many outlaw type characters) serving as they do as &quot;jump off&quot; points for so many communities. A constant flow of comers and goers gives these towns, small by other standards, a bustling and transitional feeling beyond their comparatively diminutive sizes.

== The Bush Village ==
Each hub town services a multitude of [[rural]] settlements and villages. The Bush Village presents a way of life that differs vastly from that of even its closely related parent hub. The Bush Village has a unique and profound kind of isolation that seldom is fully understood or appreciated by non-village dwellers. The following is a description of a particular village in S.W. Alaska, but the isolation of any Bush Village can be characterized by at least part of the following:
*no roads or cars, but [[boardwalk]]s for four-wheelers and paths for snow machines.
*no bathrooms with showers or hot running water; [[steam bath]]s are used exclusively for bathing.
*no restaurants or prepared foods available for sale, except for a few tiny village stores with odd hours.
*most of the food eaten in the village is caught near the village (or at seasonal &quot;fish camps&quot;) by those living in the village. (some very interesting foods are enjoyed, such as [[fermented fish]] and &quot;stink heads&quot;)
*the exception to these is at the school, where lunch, hot water and a flush toilet can be found. There is also a &quot;washeteria&quot; building where clothes can be washed and a shower can be taken for cost.
*few jobs, no economic base, very high energy costs.
*more or less daily power outages.
*delivery of US Mail is regularly delayed, sometimes for more than a week at a time.
*restrictions on alcohol (&quot;dry,&quot; illegal to consume and possess).
*the native language is spoken during official village functions and is taught at the school exclusively through third grade.
*a tiny unpaved runway with frequently unflyable conditions.

More to Add:
*Native [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act|ANSCA]] corporations, federal government lands, airstrips.

      <comment>moved [[A Little Night Music]] to [[A Little Night Music (the film)]]: Avoid confusion with Mozart's piece of the same name.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''A Little Night Music''''' is a [[Musical theater|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and book by [[Hugh Wheeler]].  Based on the [[Ingmar Bergman]] film ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'', it tells the story of a lawyer, Fredrik Egerman, who is married to a very young wife, Anne, who, despite the fact that they have been married almost a year, is still a virgin.  He sees an old flame, Desiree Armfeldt, who is appearing in a popular play, and his romantic interest in her is rekindled. However, she is having an affair with a jealous, and married, military man, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm.  Complicating matters is Egerman's son, Henrik, a divinity student who is in love with his stepmother.  The play culminates in a weekend at the country estate of Desiree's mother, Madame Armfeldt, who is looking after Desiree's daughter, Fredrika, while Desiree is on tour.

Much of the music in the show is written in [[waltz]] (3/4) [[time signature|time]], and the work is often considered an [[operetta]] rather than standard [[musical comedy]].  Despite the oblique Mozart reference in the title (see below), the elegant, [[harmony|harmonically]]-advanced music in this show pays indirect homage to the compositions of [[Maurice Ravel]], especially his ''[[Valses nobles et sentimentales]]''.  The score contains Sondheim's best-known song, &quot;[[Send in the Clowns]]&quot;, as well as such songs as &quot;The Glamorous Life,&quot; &quot;You Must Meet My Wife,&quot; &quot;Every Day a Little Death,&quot; &quot;Liaisons,&quot; &quot;In Praise of Women,&quot; &quot;A Weekend in the Country,&quot; and &quot;The Miller's Son.&quot;  The score makes heavy demands on performers, with heavy use of [[counterpoint]] and most singing parts written with an operatic range.

''A Little Night Music'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Shubert Theatre]] on [[February 25]], [[1973]], with a cast which included [[Glynis Johns]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Hermione Gingold]], [[Victoria Mallory]], [[Mark Lambert (actor)|Mark Lambert]], [[Laurence Guittard]], [[Patricia Elliott]], and [[D. Jamin-Bartlett]].  It won the [[New York Drama Critics Circle Award]] and the [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]].

The subsequent London production in 1974 starred [[Jean Simmons]], [[Joss Ackland]], [[David Kernan]], [[Diane Langton]], and [[Hermione Gingold]] reprising her role as Madame Armfeldt.

In 1978, a film version of '''A Little Night Music''' was made, starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Lesley-Anne Down]], and [[Diana Rigg]], with [[Len Cariou]], [[Hermione Gingold]], and [[Laurence Guittard]] reprising their Broadway roles.  The setting for the film was moved from Sweden to Austria, and was filmed on location.  Much of the score was cut, and many of the performers, including Taylor, were dubbed by other singers.  [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote lyrics for the &quot;Night Waltz&quot; theme (&quot;Love Takes Time&quot;) and wrote an entirely new version of &quot;The Glamorous Life&quot; which has been incorporated into several subsequent productions of the stage musical. The film marked legendary Broadway director [[Hal Prince]]'s first time as a motion picture director.

In addition to the original Broadway and London cast recordings, and the motion picture soundtrack (now out of print), there are recordings of the 1990 studio cast, the 1995 [[Royal National Theatre]] revival (starring [[Judi Dench]]), and the 2001 Barcelona cast recording sung in [[Catalan language|Catalan]].  In 1997 an all-jazz version of the score was recorded by [[Terry Trotter]].

In [[computer gaming]], [[weapon]]s are '''akimbo''' if identical weapons are held in each [[hand]]. This usually refers to [[handgun]]s (many [[first person shooter]]s have such weapons as &quot;[[Beretta]]s akimbo&quot; or &quot;[[pistol]]s akimbo&quot;) but can refer to any other weapon that can be held in one hand such as [[Machine pistol]]s (for example &quot;akimbo [[MAC-10]]s&quot;) and even melee weapons (e.g. [[katana]]s or [[lightsaber]]s). It should be noted that computer games frequently allow the player to wield submachine guns akimbo style, even though doing this in real life would render both weapons completely uncontrollable.

This particular version of ''akimbo'' is derived from [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The word is used in traditional [[samurai]] texts to describe a particular class of samurai that wielded two swords, one in each hand. The word acquired its current slang usage via fans of action director [[John Woo]], who used the word to describe his trademark style of wielding two handguns at once.

{{quotation|Give a guy a gun, he thinks he's Superman. Give him two and he thinks he's God.|John Woo|[[Hard Boiled]]}}

It has since entered into the computer gaming lexicon as well (this [[etymology]] is mentioned in the book [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0879516631 Hong Kong Action Cinema] by [[Bey Logan]]).

== Examples ==

In [[role-playing game]]s (especially [[computer role-playing game|computer RPGs]]), holding two weapons with one in each hand is called '''dual wielding'''. Notable CRPGs that allow akimbo:

* [[Diablo II]]
* [[The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall]]
* [[Knights of the Old Republic]]
* [[Neverwinter Nights]]

In [[first-person shooters]], ''dual-wielding'' refers to wielding one weapon in one hand and a different weapon in the other hand. ''Akimbo'' is a subset of ''dual-wielding'' in that the weapons in the hands of the player character are the same (&quot;dual-wielding Plasma Rifle and Magnum&quot; vs. &quot;akimbo Magnums&quot;). Notable shooter games that allow akimbo:

* [[Blood (computer game)|Blood]]
* [[BloodRayne]]
* [[Counter-Strike]] (''[[Beretta]]s'' only, though)
* [[Halo 2]]
* [[Max Payne]] and [[Max Payne 2]]

'''{{Audio|He-Ariel Sharon.ogg|Ariel &quot;Arik&quot; Sharon}}''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: אריאל &quot;אריק&quot; שרון) (born [[February 26]] [[1928]]) is the eleventh and current [[Prime Minister of Israel]], serving since February 2001. Since [[January 4]] [[2006]], Sharon has been incapacitated by the effects of a massive [[hemorrhagic stroke]].

Sharon has been a highly controversial figure, both in and outside Israel. Supporters view him as a leader who strove to establish peace without sacrificing Israel's security. Many Israelis consider him a [[war hero]] who helped defend the country during some of its greatest struggles. Some critics refer to him as &quot;the Butcher of [[Beirut]]&quot; and have sought to prosecute him as a [[war criminal]] for alleged crimes related to the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], for which the [[Kahan Commission]] held him indirectly responsible.

On [[January 4]] [[2006]], Sharon suffered a massive [[hemorrhagic stroke]], was declared &quot;temporarily incapable of discharging his powers&quot;, and [[Ehud Olmert]], the Deputy Prime Minister, was officially confirmed as the Acting Prime Minister of Israel. Sharon is currently undergoing medical treatment; see the ''[[#Incapacitation|Incapacitation]]'' section.

==Early life==
Sharon was born '''Ariel Scheinermann''' [[February 26]] [[1928]] to Shmuel and Dvora (formerly Vera), immigrants from [[Russia]]. They arrived in the  [[Aliyah#Second Aliyah|Second Aliyah]] and settled in a [[socialist]] and [[secular]] community, where they, despite being [[Mapai]] supporters, were known to be contrarians against the prevailing community consensus:

:''The Scheinermans' eventual ostracism... followed the 1933 Arlozorov murder when Dvora and Shmuel refused to endorse the Labor movement's anti-Revisionist calumny and participate in Bolshevi(k)-style public revilement rallies, then the order of the day. Retribution was quick to come. They were expelled from the local health-fund clinic and village synagogue. The cooperative's truck wouldn't make deliveries to their farm nor collect produce.'' [http://www.netanyahu.org/antacyonsche.html]

In 1942 at the age of 14, he joined the [[Gadna]], a [[Paramilitary force|paramilitary]] youth [[battalion]], and later the [[Haganah]], the underground paramilitary force and the Jewish military [[precursor]] to the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. At the creation of Israel (and [[Haganah]]'s transformation into the Israel Defense Forces), Sharon was a [[platoon]] commander in the [[Alexandroni Brigade]]. Sharon was severely wounded in the [[groin]] by the [[Jordan]]ian [[Arab Legion]] in the Second Battle of [[Latrun]], an unsuccessful attempt to relieve the [[Siege|besieged]] [[Jew]]ish community of [[Jerusalem]]. His injuries eventually healed. 

In September 1949, he was [[Promotion|promoted]] to [[Company (military unit)|company]] commander (of the Golani Brigade's reconnaissance unit) and in 1950 to [[intelligence officer]] for Central Command. He then took leave to begin studies of history and Middle Eastern culture at the [[Hebrew University|Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. A year and a half later, he was asked to return to active service in the rank of [[major]] and as the leader of the new [[Unit 101]], Israel's first [[special forces]] unit.

Unit 101 undertook a series of [[Revenge|retaliatory]] [[raid]]s against [[Palestinian]]s and neighboring [[Arab]] states that helped bolster Israeli morale and fortify its [[deterrence|deterrent]] image. However, the unit was also known for targeting civilians as well as Arab soldiers, notably in the widely condemned [[Qibya massacre|Qibya operation]] in the fall of 1953, in which 69 Palestinian civilians, half of which were women and children, were killed by Sharon's troops in a reprisal attack on their [[West Bank]] village.  In the [[documentary]] &quot;Israel and the Arabs: 50 Year War&quot; Ariel Sharon recalls what happened after the raid, which was heavily condemned by many countries in the West, including the U.S.:

:''I was summoned to see [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]]. It was the first time I met him, and right from the start Ben-Gurion said to me: &quot;Let me first tell you one thing: it doesn't matter what the world says about Israel, it doesn't matter what they say about us anywhere else. The only thing that matters is that we can exist here on the land of our forefathers. And unless we show the Arabs that there is a high price to pay for murdering Jews, we won't survive.&quot;''

Shortly afterwards, just a few months after its founding, Unit 101 was merged into the 202nd [[Paratroopers Brigade]] (Sharon eventually became the latter's commander), which continued to attack military and civilian targets, culminating with the attack on [[Qalqilyah]] police station in autumn 1956.

Sharon has been [[widow]]ed twice. Shortly after becoming a [[Drill instructor|military instructor]], he married his first wife, [[Margalit Sharon|Margalit]], with whom he had a son, Gur.  Margalit died in a [[car accident]] in 1962. Their son, Gur, died in October 1967 after a friend shot him while they were playing with the elder Sharon's [[rifle]]. [http://www.smh.com.au/news/Middle-East-Conflict/Sharon-mourns-slain-son/2005/02/14/1108229937965.html] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,589127,00.html] [http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0306/14/pitn.00.html] After Margalith's death, Sharon married her younger sister, [[Lily Sharon|Lily]]. They had two sons, [[Omri Sharon|Omri]] and [[Gilad Sharon|Gil'ad]]. Lily Sharon died in 2000.

==Mitla incident==
In the [[1956 Suez War]] (the British &quot;[[Operation Musketeer]]&quot;), Sharon commanded the 202nd Brigade and was responsible for taking ground east of the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]'s [[Mitla Pass]] and eventually taking the pass itself. Having successfully carried out the first part of his mission (joining a battalion paratrooped near Mitla with the rest of the brigade moving on ground), Sharon's unit was deployed near the pass. Neither [[reconnaissance aircraft]] nor [[Reconnaissance|scouts]] reported enemy forces inside the Mitla Pass. Sharon, whose forces were initially heading east, away from the pass, reported to his superiors that he was increasingly concerned with the possibility of an enemy thrust through the pass, which could attack his brigade from the flank or the rear.

Sharon asked for permission to attack the pass several times but his requests were denied although he was allowed to check its status so that if the pass was empty, he could receive permission to take it later. Sharon sent a small scout force which was met with heavy fire and became bogged down due to vehicle [[malfunction]] in the middle of the pass. Sharon ordered the rest of his troops to attack in order to aid their comrades. In the ensuing successful battle to capture the pass thirty-eight Israeli soldiers were killed. Sharon was not only criticized by his superiors, he was damaged by revelations several years later by several former subordinates (one of IDF's first major revelations to the press), who claimed that Sharon tried to provoke the [[Egypt]]ians and sent out the scouts in bad faith, ensuring that a battle would ensue. Deliberate or not, the attack was considered strategically reckless because the Egyptian forces were expected to withdraw from the pass in the following one or two days.

==Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War==
{{main articles|[[Six-Day War]] and [[Yom Kippur War]]}}
The Mitla incident hindered Sharon's military career for several years. In the meantime, he occupied the position of an infantry brigade commander and received a [[law degree]] from [[Tel Aviv University]]. When [[Yitzhak Rabin]] (who within a few years became associated with the [[Labour (Israel)|Labour Party]]) became [[Chief of Staff]] in 1962, however, Sharon began again to rise rapidly in the ranks, occupying the positions of Infantry School Commander and Head of Army Training Branch, eventually achieving the rank of [[Major General]] (''[[Aluf]]''). In the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Sharon commanded the most powerful armored division on the Sinai [[Front (military)|front]] which made a breakthrough in the Kusseima-Abu-Ageila fortified area. In 1969, he was appointed the Head of IDF's Southern Command. He had no further promotions before retiring in August 1973. Soon after, he joined the right-wing Likud [[political party]].[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/storyville/ariel-sharon.shtml] 

[[Image:Arik_Sharon_with_Bandage_Dayan.jpg|right|thumb|22
30px|Sharon (in bandage) with [[Moshe Dayan]] (right) in 1973]]

Sharon' s military career was not over, however. At the start of the [[Yom Kippur War]] on [[October 6]] [[1973]], Sharon was called back to duty and assigned to command a reserve armored division. His forces did not engage the [[Egyptian Army]] immediately but it was Sharon who helped locate a breach between the Egyptian forces, which he then exploited by capturing a [[bridgehead]] on [[October 16]] and throwing a bridge across the [[Suez Canal]] the following day. He violated his orders from the head of Southern Command by exploiting this success to cut the [[supply line]]s of the Egyptian Third Army, located to the south of the canal crossing, isolating it from other Egyptian units.

The divisions of Sharon and [[Abraham Adan|Abraham Adan]] (Bren) passed over this bridge into [[Africa]] advancing to within 101 kilometers of [[Cairo]]. They wreaked havoc on the supply lines of the Third Army stretching to the south of them, cutting off and [[Encirclement|encircling]] the Third Army, but could not force its surrender before the [[cease-fire]]. Tensions between the two generals followed his decision, but a [[military tribunal]] later found his action was militarily effective. This move was regarded by many Israelis as the turning point of the war in the Sinai front. Thus, Sharon is viewed by some as a [[war hero]] who saved Israel from defeat in Sinai. A photo of Sharon wearing a head bandage on the Suez Canal became a famous symbol of Israeli military prowess.

Sharon's aggressive political positions were controversial and he was relieved of duty in February 1974.

==Sabra and Shatila massacre==
{{main|Sabra and Shatila massacre}}
During the [[1982 Lebanon War]], while Ariel Sharon was [[Defense minister]], the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] took place, in which between 460 and 3,500 Palestinian civilians in the [[refugee camp]]s were killed by Lebanese Christian forces under the command of Lebanese [[Maronite]] [[Phalange]] [[militia]]. The Security Chief of the Phalange militia, [[Elie Hobeika]], was the ground commander of the militiamen who entered the Palestinian camps and killed the Palestinians. The Phalange had been sent into the camps to clear out [[PLO]] fighters, and Israeli forces had been sent to the camps at Sharon's command to provide them with [[logistical]] support and to guard camp exits.

The [[Kahan Commission]] claimed that &quot;absolutely no direct responsibility devolves upon Israel or upon those who acted in its behalf.&quot; Yet it did charge Sharon with &quot;personal responsibility.&quot; It recommended in early 1983 the removal of Sharon from his post as Defense minister. In their recommendations and closing remarks, the commission stated:

:''We have found, as has been detailed in this report, that the Minister of Defense [Ariel Sharon] bears personal responsibility. In our opinion, it is fitting that the Minister of Defense draw the appropriate personal conclusions arising out of the defects revealed with regard to the manner in which he discharged the duties of his office - and if necessary, that the [[Prime Minister]] consider whether he should exercise his authority under Section 21-A(a) of the Basic Law: the Government, according to which &quot;the Prime Minister may, after informing the Cabinet of his intention to do so, remove a minister from office.&quot;''[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1982-1984/104%20Report%20of%20the%20Commission%20of%20Inquiry%20into%20the%20e]

Nevertheless the [[Kahan Commission]] did not interview Palestinian survivors of the massacre.

Journalist [[Robert Fisk]], based on some eyewitness accounts and his own investigation, alleged that Sharon and the IDF bore a greater responsibility for the massacre, describing Sharon's efforts to stop the massacre as &quot;pitiful&quot; and &quot;inadequate&quot;.

An AP report on [[15 September]] [[1982]] stated : 

:''Defence Minister Ariel Sharon, in a statement, tied the killing [of the Phalangist leader Gemayel] to the PLO, saying: &quot;It symbolises the terrorist murderousness of the PLO terrorist organisations and their supporters.&quot;  Habib Chartouni, a Lebanese Christian from the Syrian Socialist National Party confessed to the murder of Gemayel, and no Palestinians were involved. Sharon had used this to instigate the entrance of the Lebanese militias into the camps.''[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/fisk/article336785.ece]

Sharon was dismissed by Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] but he remained in successive governments as a Minister.

In 1987, [[Time Magazine|''TIME'' magazine]] published a story implying Sharon was directly responsible for the massacres. Sharon [[Lawsuit|sued]] ''Time'' for [[Slander and libel|libel]] in American and Israeli [[court]]s. ''Time'' won the suit in the U.S. court because although the [[jury]] found the article false and defamatory, Sharon could not establish that ''Time'' had &quot;acted out of malice,&quot; as required under the U.S. law. [http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=10&amp;x_subject=3]

On [[June 18]], [[2001]], relatives of the victims of the Sabra massacre began proceedings in [[Belgium]] to have Ariel Sharon indicted on war crimes charges [http://www.caabu.org/campaigns/complaint-against-sharon.html]. In June 2002, a [[Brussels]] Appeals Court rejected the lawsuit because the law was subsequently changed under heavy U.S. pressure to disallow such lawsuits unless a Belgian citizen is involved. [http://www.droit.fundp.ac.be/cours/pen/JC032C1.pdf]

==Political career==
When Sharon joined Begin's government he had relatively little political experience. He avoided Begin's [[Herut]] party in the 1940s and 1950s and seemed to be personally devoted to the ideals of [[Mapai]], and then Labor. However, after retiring from military service, Sharon was instrumental in establishing the [[Likud]] in July 1973. The [[Likud]] was comprised of [[Herut]], the [[Israel Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] and independent elements. Sharon became chairman of the campaign staff for the elections which were scheduled for November 1973. But two and a half weeks after the start of the election campaign, the [[Yom Kippur War]] erupted and Sharon was called back to reserve service (''see above''). In December 1973 Sharon was elected to the [[Knesset]], but a year later he tired of political life and resigned.

From June 1975 to March 1976, Sharon was a special aide to Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]]. With the 1977 elections near, Sharon tried to return to the Likud and replace [[Menachem Begin]] at the head of the party. He suggested to [[Simcha Ehrlich]], who headed the Liberal Party bloc in the Likud, that he was more fitting than Begin to win an election victory; but he was rejected. Following this he tried to join the [[Israel Labor Party|Labour Party]] and the centrist [[Shinui|DASH]], but was rejected in those parties too. Only then did he form his own list, [[Shlomtzion Party|Shlomtzion]], which won only two Knesset seats in the subsequent elections. Immediately after the elections he merged Shlomtzion with the Likud and became Minister of Agriculture.

During this period, Sharon supported the [[Gush Emunim]] settlements movement and was viewed as the patron of the messianic settlers' movement. He used his position to encourage the establishment of a network of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories to prevent the possibility of the return of these territories to Palestinian Arabs. Sharon doubled the number of Jewish settlements on the West Bank and Gaza Strip during his tenure.

On his settlement policy, Sharon said while addressing a meeting of the Tsomet Party: &quot;Everybody has to move, run and grab as many (Palestinian) hilltops as they can to enlarge the (Jewish) settlements because everything we take now will stay ours... Everything we don't grab will go to them.&quot; (Agence France Presse, [[15 November]] [[1998]].)

After the 1981 elections, Begin rewarded Sharon for his important contribution to Likud's narrow win, by appointing him Minister of Defense. (''See above for further information about Sharon's tenure as Minister of Defense.'')

After being dismissed from the Defense Minister post because the Kahan Commission found him &quot;personally responsible&quot; for his &quot;disregard of the danger of a massacre,&quot; Sharon remained in successive governments as a Minister without portfolio (1983&amp;ndash;1984), Minister for Trade and Industry (1984&amp;ndash;1990), and Minister for Housing Construction (1990&amp;ndash;1992). During this period he was a rival to then prime minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]], but failed in various bids to replace him as chairman of the ruling [[Likud]] party. Their rivalry reached a head on the &quot;Night of Microphones&quot; in February 1990, when Sharon snapped the microphone from Shamir, who was addressing the Likud central committee, and famously exclaimed: &quot;Who's for wiping out terrorism?&quot;. The implication was that only Sharon knew how to destroy the scourge and whoever deemed this as important should support him. The incident was widely viewed as an apparent [[putsch]] attempt against Shamir's leadership of the party.

==Prime Minister==

In [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s 1996&amp;ndash;1999 government, he was Minister of National Infrastructure (1996&amp;ndash;1998), and Foreign Minister (1998&amp;ndash;1999). Upon the election of the [[Ehud Barak|Barak]] Labor government, Sharon became leader of the Likud party. After the collapse of Barak's government, he was elected Prime Minister in February 2001.

[[The Greek island affair]] involves attempts by [[David Appel]] to purchase an island near the coast of [[Athens]] for the purpose of building a multimillion-dollar resort complex.
While Ariel Sharon was [[Foreign Minister]] under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 1999, Appel contracted to pay his Sharon's son, [[Gilad Sharon|Gilad]], then 30 years old and a business novice, $20,000 monthly as a business consultant. According to reports, Gilad might have received up to $3 million had the project been successful.
Police believe Appel signed the contract with Gilad Sharon in order to secure his father's help in facilitating the resort project. Sharon later hosted the deputy foreign minister of [[Greece]] during his visit to Israel. Appel is widely suspected of bribing [[Ehud Olmert]], the former mayor of [[Jerusalem]] into helping him by funding an official banquet held for the Athenian mayor. 
In return for the aid received from both Likud leaders, Appel allegedly contributed to the campaigns of both men when they ran for chairman of the Likud after Netanyahu's resignation in 1999. On [[June 14]] [[2004]], Israel's Attorney General, [[Meni Mazouz]], decided to close the case due to lack of evidence and prosecutorial misconduct.

[[Image:Red Sea Summit in Aqaba.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palestinian]] Prime Minister [[Mahmoud Abbas]], [[United States]] President [[George W. Bush]], and Ariel Sharon after reading statement to the press during the closing moments of the Red Sea Summit in [[Aqaba]], [[Jordan]], [[June 4]] [[2003]].]]

According to the Palestinians, Ariel Sharon has followed an aggressive policy of non-negotiation. Palestinians allege that the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]] (September 2000&amp;ndash;February 2005) was sparked by a visit by Sharon and an escort of several hundred policemen to the [[Haram al-Sharif]]/[[Temple Mount]] complex, site of the [[Dome of the Rock]] and [[al-Aqsa Mosque]]. Sharon's visit, prior to his election as Prime Minister, came after archeologists claimed that extensive building operations at the site were destroying priceless antiquities and a few months before the election. While visiting the site, Sharon declared that the complex would remain under perpetual Israeli control. Palestinian commentators accused Sharon of purposely inflaming emotions with the event to provoke a violent response and obstruct success of delicate ongoing peace talks.

Sharon's supporters claim that [[Yasser Arafat]] and the [[Palestinian Authority]] planned the intifada. [http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/111P55.htm] [http://www.townhall.com/columnists/charleskrauthammer/ck20010520.shtml] [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mf19.html#a1] [http://www.eretzyisroel.org/~jkatz/alaksa.html]. They state that Palestinian security chief Jabril Rajoub provided assurances that if Sharon did not enter the mosques, no problems would arise. They also often quote statements by Palestinian Authority officials, particularly Imad Falouji, the P.A. Communications Minister, who admitted months after Sharon's visit that the violence had been planned in July, far in advance of Sharon's visit, stating the intifada &quot;was carefully planned since the return of (Palestinian President) Yasser Arafat from [[Camp David]] negotiations rejecting the U.S. conditions.&quot;[http://gulf-news.com/Articles/print.asp?ArticleID=11166][http://jewishweek.org/news/newscontent.php3?artid=3846] According to the Mitchell Report, the government of Israel asserted that
[[Image:sharon_bush_abbas.jpg|thumb|left|President [[George W. Bush]], center, discusses the [[Peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|Middle East peace process]] with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel, left, and Palestinian Prime Minister [[Mahmoud Abbas]] in [[Aqaba]], [[Jordan]], [[June 4]], [[2003]].]]
:''the immediate catalyst for the violence was the breakdown of the Camp David negotiations on [[25 July]] [[2000]] and the &amp;#8220;widespread appreciation in the international community of Palestinian responsibility for the impasse.&amp;#8221; In this view, Palestinian violence was planned by the PA leadership, and was aimed at &amp;#8220;provoking and incurring Palestinian casualties as a means of regaining the diplomatic initiative.&amp;#8221;''
The Mitchell Report, based on a subsequent investigation, also found that the Sharon visit did not cause the Al-Aqsa Intifada, though it was poorly timed and would clearly have a provocative effect.[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/Mitchellrep.html]

Palestinians doubt the existence of popular support for Sharon's actions. Polls published in the media, as well as the 140% call-up of reservists (as opposed to the 60% in regular periods) seem to indicate that the Israeli public is quite supportive of Sharon's policies. A survey conducted by Tel Aviv University's Jaffe Center in May 2004 found that 80% of Jewish Israelis believe that the Israel Defense Forces have succeeded in militarily countering the Al-Aqsa Intifada, [http://spirit.tau.ac.il/socant/peace/peaceindex/2004/data/may2004d.pdf] indicating widespread faith in Sharon's hard-line policy.

[[Image:Bush sharon.jpg|thumb|President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon meet in the White House on [[14 April]] [[2004]].]]

On [[July 20]] [[2004]], Sharon called on [[France|French]] [[Jew]]s to emigrate from France to Israel immediately, in light of an increase in French [[anti-Semitism]] (94 anti-Semitic assaults reported in the first six months of 2004 compared to 47 in 2003). France has the third largest Jewish population (about 600,000 people), after the [[United States]] and [[Israel]]. Sharon claimed that an &quot;unfettered anti-Semitism&quot; reigned in France. The French government responded by describing his comments as &quot;unacceptable&quot;, as did the French representative Jewish organization [[CRIF]], which denied Sharon's claim of intense anti-Semitism in French society. An Israeli spokesperson later claimed that Sharon had been misunderstood. France then postponed a visit by Sharon. Upon his visit, both Sharon and Chirac were described as showing a willingness to put the issue behind them.

On [[July 26]], [[2005]], Israeli attorney general [[Menachem Mazuz]] announced that he would indict Sharon's son, [[Omri Sharon|Omri]], on charges of [[political corruption|corruption]]. Omri had [[parliamentary immunity]] at the time, but indicated willingness to stand trial. The Knesset passed a law limiting members' immunity in order to allow the indictment and Omri was formally indicted on [[August 28]].

==Gaza evacuation==
While some believe that his recent efforts have been damaging to the peace process, he has embarked on a risky course of unilateral withdrawal from the [[Gaza Strip]], while maintaining control of its coastline and airspace. It has been welcomed by both the [[Palestinian Authority]] and the left-wing in Israel, as well as by many abroad, including the United States and the [[European Union]], as a step towards a final peace settlement. However, it has been greeted with opposition from within his own Likud party and from other right-wing Israelis, on security, military, and religious grounds. Other detractors have publicly distrusted Sharon's motives for this plan, and their suspicions were further roused after publication of an interview with top Sharon aide Dov Weisglass in the Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' on [[October 8]] [[2004]], in which he explained Israel's motivation for withdrawing from Gaza. He told the newspaper that both Israel and the US felt Palestinian terrorism must end before a political process leading to a Palestinian state begins. Otherwise, Weisglass said, &quot;the result would be a Palestinian state with terrorism...&quot; The Gaza withdrawal would allow Israel to delay negotiations, and a Palestinian state, until such time that their leadership abandons violence. Critics interpreted Weisglass' comments as saying the purpose of disengagement was to destroy Palestinian aspirations for a state for years to come. This incident has bolstered the position of critics that Sharon is intentionally trying to destroy the peace process, an accusation denied by the Prime Minister's camp. {{further|[[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004]]}}

On [[December 1]] [[2004]], Sharon dismissed five ministers from the Shinui party for voting against the government's 2005 budget. In January 2005 Sharon formed a national unity government that included representatives of Likud, Labour, and [[Meimad]] and [[Degel HaTorah]] as &quot;out-of-government&quot; supporters without any seats in the government ([[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] parties usually reject having ministerial offices as a policy). Between [[August 16]] and [[August 30]] [[2005]], Sharon controversially expelled 8,500 Jewish settlers from 21 settlements in Gaza. Once it became clear that the evictions were definitely going ahead a group of extreme right-wing Rabbis, led by Rabbi [[Yosef Dayan]] placed an ancient curse on him calling on the [[Angel of Death]] to intervene and kill him. After Israeli soldiers bulldozed every settlement structure except for several former [[synagogue]] buildings, Israeli soldiers formally left Gaza on Sunday, [[September 11]] [[2005]] and closed the border fence at [[Kissufim]]. The synagogues were later looted and burned to the ground by miscreants. While his decision to withdraw from Gaza sparked bitter protests from far-right members of the Likud party and the settler movement, opinion polls showed that it was a popular move among most of the Israeli electorate. On [[September 27]] [[2005]], Sharon narrowly defeated a leadership challenge by a 52-48% vote. The move was initiated within the central committee of the governing Likud party by his main rival, [[Binyamin Netanyahu]], who had left the cabinet to protest Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza. The measure was an attempt by Netanyahu to call an early primary in November 2005 to choose the party's leader.

==Founding of Kadima==
On [[November 21]] [[2005]], Sharon  resigned as head of Likud, and dissolved parliament to form a new centre-right party called ''[[Kadima]]'' (&quot;Forward&quot;).[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1107AP_Sharon_No_Return.html] November polls indicated that Sharon was likely to be returned to the prime ministership.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-5431649,00.html]  On [[December 20]] [[2005]], Sharon's longtime rival [[Binyamin Netanyahu]] was elected his successor as leader of Likud [http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1671030,00.html]. Netanyahu, along with [[Labour (Israel)|Labor]]'s [[Amir Peretz]], are to be ''Kadima'''s chief rivals in the [[Israel legislative election, 2006|March 2006 elections]].

==Incapacitation==
{{Current section}}
{{main|Illnesses of Ariel Sharon}}

Sharon was hospitalised on [[December 18]] [[2005]] after reportedly suffering a minor [[ischemic stroke]]. Sharon spent four days in hospital, and was released on [[December 20]]. During his hospital stay, he was also diagnosed with a minor hole in his heart and was scheduled to undergo a [[cardiac catheterization]] to fill the hole in his [[atrial septum]] on [[January 5]], [[2006]].

On [[January 4]], however, Sharon suffered a massive [[hemorrhagic stroke]] and was evacuated by ambulance from his ranch, [[Havat Hashikmim]] in the [[Negev|Negev region]] to [[Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital|Hadassah hospital]], [[Jerusalem]], to undergo [[brain surgery]]. Although Sharon was reported to be in stable condition, his doctors called this stroke &quot;significant&quot;, adding that he &quot;suffered a [[cerebral hemorrhage]],&quot; which is bleeding in the brain. Sharon underwent seven hours of surgery to stop the bleeding and drain the accumulated blood. Hadassah director Professor [[Shlomo Mor-Yosef]] reported after the surgery that the bleeding had stopped: &quot;all the parameters are according to expectations after an operation of this type.&quot; The doctors estimated his chances for recovery as being &quot;very low.&quot;  

Earlier in the day, members of the media incorrectly reported that Sharon had died, after doctors at the hospital were prepared to announce his death. However, they were convinced by family and advisors to try, once again, to save his life. 

On the night of Sharon's stroke, in the wake of his serious illness, and following consultations between Government Secretary [[Israel Maimon]] and Attorney General [[Meni Mazouz]], Sharon was declared &quot;temporarily incapable of discharging his powers&quot;, and [[Ehud Olmert]], the Deputy Prime Minister, was officially confirmed as the Acting Prime Minister of Israel. Olmert and the Cabinet announced that the [[Israel legislative election, 2006|elections]] would take place on [[March 28]] as scheduled. According to Israeli law, an Acting Prime Minister can remain in office 100 days after Prime Minister has become  incapacitated before the President has to appoint a new Prime Minister. Sharon has not yet been declared permanently incapacitated.

During the rest of January, Sharon's condition remained essentially unchanged. On [[February 11]], he underwent an operation to investigate damage to his digestive tract. It was found that he was suffering from [[intestine|intestinal]] bleeding and life-threatening [[necrosis]], and about 50 cm of his intestines were consequently removed. On [[February 22]], he underwent an additional procedure to drain excess fluid from his stomach, discovered during a routine [[computed tomography|CT]] scan.

On [[February 2]], Sharon's Kadima party issued its ticket for the March elections to the Knesset. Since Sharon was unable to sign a nomination form, he is not a candidate and will thus cease to be a Knesset member in March. This means that even if his medical condition improves, he will be unable to continue his current tenure as Prime Minister.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Affectional orientation''' is an alternative term for [[sexual orientation]]. Those people who prefer it argue that one's orientation goes far beyond [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. To holders of this view, one's orientation is defined by whom one is predisposed to fall [[limerence|in love]] with, sexual attraction being only a part of a larger dynamic.

The term is also used by those who consider themselves [[asexuality|asexual]] to describe the [[gender]] or genders they are romantically attracted to.  The terms used for different affectional orientations are typically the same as are used for [[sexual orientation]]s: [[homosexuality|homosexual]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]].

There are also those who hold the view that their orientation is defined by who one has affection towards and that their sexual attraction is based on affection for another human being's personal qualities rather than their gender or appearance. This does not necessarily require either person to fall in love but is still based on a personal affection.

There are two species of '''anoa''': the '''Mountain Anoa''' (''Bubalus quarlesi'') and the '''Lowland Anoa''' (''Bubalus depressicornis''). Both live in undisturbed forest, and although they are essentially miniature [[Water Buffalo]], are similar in appearance to a deer, weighing 150&amp;ndash;300&amp;nbsp;kg (330&amp;ndash;660&amp;nbsp;lb). 

Both are found on the island of [[Sulawesi]] in [[Indonesia]]; the Mountain Anoa is also found on the nearby island of [[Butung]]. They apparently live singly or in pairs, rather than herds, except when the cows are about to give birth. One young is born per year.
[[image:Lowland_Anoa.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A Lowland Anoa]]

Both species of anoa have been classified as endangered since the [[1960s]] and the population continues to decrease.  It is believed unlikely that there are more than 5000 animals of each species remaining.  Reasons for the decline of the anoa include hunting for hide, horns and meat by the indigenous peoples (though they were rarely hunted by indigenous peoples before the introduction of modern firearms); shooting by the military; and loss of habitat due to the advancement of settlement.  Currently, hunting is the more serious factor in most areas. The anoa do not appear to be adaptable to humans.

Mountain Anoa are also known as Anoa de Montana, Anoa de Quarle, Anoa des Montagnes, Anoa Pegunungan, and Quarle's Anoa. Lowland Anoa are also known as Anoa de Ilanura or Anoa des Plaines.

Lowland Anoa stands but little over a yard at the shoulder, and is the most diminutive of all wild cattle. It is nearly allied to the larger Asiatic buffaloes, showing the same reversal of the direction of the hair on the back. The horns are peculiar for their upright direction and comparative straightness, although they have the same triangular section as in other buffaloes. White spots are sometimes present below the eyes, and there may be white markings on the legs and back; and the absence or presence of these white markings may be indicative of distinct races. The horns of the cows are very small. The nearest allies of the anoa appear to be certain extinct buffaloes, of which the remains are found in the Siwalik Hills of northern India. In habits the animal appears to resemble the Indian buffalo.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Agner Krarup Erlang''' ([[January 1]], [[1878]]&amp;ndash;[[February 3]], [[1929]]) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[mathematician]], [[statistician]], and [[engineer]] who invented the fields of [[traffic engineering (telecommunications)|traffic engineering]] and [[queueing theory]].

Erlang was born at [[Lonborg]] (Lønborg), near [[Tarm]], in [[Jutland]]. He was the son of a schoolmaster and with his maternal mathematical ancestor [[Thomas Fincke]], he demonstrated his potential from an early age by being able to read books upside down.  He passed the ''Preliminary Examination'' offered by the [[University of Copenhagen]], with distinction, at age 14, after receiving dispensation to sit because he was younger than the usual minimum age.

For the next two years he taught alongside his father.

With a distant relative providing free board and lodgings, he prepared for and sat the University of [[Copenhagen]] entrance examination in [[1896]], which he passed with distinction.  He won a scholarship to the University of Copenhagen and majored in [[mathematics]], but also studied [[astronomy]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].  He graduated in [[1901]] with an MA and subsequently taught at several schools over the next 7 years.  He maintained his interest in mathematics and received an award for one paper that he submitted to the University of Copenhagen.

He was a member of the Danish Mathematicians' Association and through this met amateur mathematician [[Johan Jensen]], the Chief Engineer of the [[Copenhagen Telephone Company]], an offshoot of the [[Bell System|International Bell Telephone Company]].  Erlang subsequently obtained employment with the company in [[1908]].  He worked for the Copenhagen Telephone Company for almost 20 years, until his death in Copenhagen after an abdominal operation.

It was while working for the Copenhagen Telephone Company that Erlang was presented with the classic problem of determining how many circuits were needed to provide an acceptable telephone service.  However, his thinking went further in that he also realised that mathematics could be applied to assess how many operators were needed to handle a given volume of telephone calls.  At that time most telephone exchanges used human operators and cord boards to switch telephone calls by means of jack plugs.

Out of necessity, Erlang was a hands-on researcher.  He would conduct his own measurements and was prepared to climb into street manholes to do so.

Erlang was also an expert in both the history and calculation of the numerical tables of mathematical functions, particularly [[logarithm]]s.  He devised new calculation methods for certain forms of mathematical tables.

He developed his theory concerning telephone traffic over several years.  His significant publications include: 
*In 1909 - &quot;The Theory of Probabilities and Telephone Conversations&quot; - which proves that the [[Poisson distribution]] applies to random telephone traffic.
*In 1917 - &quot;Solution of some Problems in the Theory of Probabilities of Significance in Automatic Telephone Exchanges&quot; - which contains his classic formulae for loss and waiting time.

These and other notable papers were translated into English, French and German.  His papers were prepared in a very brief style and can be difficult to understand without a background in the field. So that his papers could be studied in the original Danish, one researcher from [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] learnt the language. 

The [[BT Group plc|British Post Office]] accepted his formula as the basis for calculating circuit facilities. 

He was an associate of the British [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]]. 

The unit, distribution and language listed below have all been named in his honour.

The '''Arab-Israeli conflict''' is a long-running conflict in the [[Middle East]] concerning [[Zionism|Zionist]] and subsequent immigration of non-local [[Jew]]s, joining the existing Jewish population in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]], their claim to [[self-determination]] in the [[Land of Israel]] and, after the establishment of the [[State of Israel]], the country's relations with the Arab states and the Palestinian population (see [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]). Some uses of the term ''Middle East conflict'' referring to this matter, but the region has been host to other disputes and wars not directly involving Israel (see [[List of conflicts in the Middle East]]).

Despite involving a relatively small land area and number of casualties, the conflict has been the focus of worldwide media and diplomatic attention for decades. Some groups fear that the Arab-Israeli conflict is a part of (or precursor to) a wider [[clash of civilizations]] between the [[Western World]] and the Arab or [[Muslim]] world. Animosity emanating from this conflict has caused numerous attacks on supporters (or perceived supporters) of one side by supporters of the other side in many countries around the world. The map shows the nation of Israel as well as the nations of the Middle East and Africa that are members of the [[Arab League]], including many that have never been directly involved in the conflict.  Many more people in other countries feel involvement in the conflict, for reasons such as cultural and religious ties with [[Islam]] and/or [[Arab culture]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], or for ideological or strategic reasons; these include countries such as [[Iran]] and the [[United States]].

==History==
The Arab-Israeli conflict is a modern phenomenon, which dates back to the end of the 19th century. The conflict became a major international issue after the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1917, and in various forms it continues to this day. The Arab-Israeli conflict has resulted in at least five major wars and a number of &quot;minor conflicts&quot;. It has also been the source of two major Palestinian [[intifada]]s (uprisings) and is cited by [[al-Qaeda]], a largely Arab organization, as one of the reasons for its conflict with the Western world. The periods of conflict include:

===Before 1947===
Tensions between the Jews and Arabs started to emerge after the 1880s, when European Jews began to immigrate and augment Palestinian Jewish communities by buying up land from Ottoman and individual Arab landholders, and establishing agricultural settlements in the historic lands of Judea and Israel, which were then part of the Ottoman empire [http://www.ismi.emory.edu/JournalArticles/MESapr84.html]. By the 1920s, tension had given way to violence, such as the [[Riots in Palestine of 1920]], [[Jaffa riots]] of 1921. To assuage the Arabs, and due to British inability to control Arab violence in the [[British Mandate]] any other way, the semi-autonomous Arab Emirate of Transjordan was created in all Palestinian territory east of the Jordan river (roughly 80% of the mandate). The violence continued to mount, however, throughout the 1930s and 40s, resulting in loss of life on all sides, including the [[Riots in Palestine of 1929]], [[Irgun| a series of Zionist attacks]], [[Great Uprising|the Great Arab Uprising of 1936-1939]], [[Lehi_%28group%29|the Assassination of British Mandate Officials]], and the 1946 [[King David Hotel bombing]].

===War of 1948===
[[Image:1948 arab israeli war - May15-June10.jpg|right|thumb|[[May 15]] - [[June 10]]]]
The [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], known as the &quot;Israeli War of Independence&quot; or [[Palestinian exodus|&quot;al-Nakba&quot; (The Disaster)]], 1948-1949, began after the British withdrawal and the declaration of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] on [[May 14]] [[1948]]. The Arabs had rejected the November [[1947 UN Partition Plan]], which proposed the establishment of Arab and Jewish states in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Arab militias had begun campaigns to control territory inside and outside the designated borders. Joint Jordanian, Egyptian, Syrian, Lebanese and Iraqi troops invaded Palestine, which Israel, the [[United States|US]], the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union]], and [[Trygve Lie|UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie]] called illegal aggression, while [[China]] broadly backed the Arab claims. The Arab states proclaimed their aim of a  &quot;United State of Palestine&quot;[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Cablegram_from_the_Secretary-General_of_the_League_of_Arab_States_to_the_Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations] in place of Israel and an Arab state. They considered the UN Plan to be invalid because it was opposed by Palestine's Arab majority, and claimed that the British withdrawal led to an absence of legal authority, making it necessary for them to protect Arab lives and property.[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/d442111e70e417e3802564740045a309?OpenDocument] About two thirds of Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from the territories which came under Jewish control (see [[Palestinian exodus]]); practically all of the much smaller number of Jews in the territories captured by the Arabs, for example the Old City of Jerusalem, also fled or were expelled. About 700,000 Arabs (estimates vary from 520,000 to 957,000 [http://www.arts.mcgill.ca/MEPP/PRRN/proverview.html]) became refugees during the fighting. 

The fighting ended with signing of the [[Rhodes Armistice]], which formalized Israeli control of the area allotted to the Jewish state plus just over half of the [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|area allotted to the Arab state]]. The [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt]] and the [[Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|West Bank by Jordan]] until June 1967 when they were seized by Israel during the [[Six-Day War]].

===Aftermath of the 1948 war===
[[Image:1947-UN-Partition-Plan-1949-Armistice-Comparison.png|right|185px|thumb|Comparison between partition plan and armistice lines]]

The Palestinians who fled or were expelled from the areas that became Israel were not allowed to return to their homes, and took up residence in refugee camps in surrounding countries, including [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], and the area that was later to be known as the [[Gaza Strip]].  The [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] was established to alleviate their condition.

Over several years after the 1948 war ended, approximately 900,000 [http://www.jimena-justice.org] Jews fled the Arab countries they were living in, in many cases owing to anti-Jewish sentiment, expulsion (in the case of Egypt), or, in the case of Iraq, legal oppression (see [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]]); of these 900,000, two thirds ended up in [[ma'abarot|refugee camps]] in Israel, while the remainder migrated to France, the United States and other Western or Latin American countries. Since that time, Israel has maintained that an [[population transfer|exchange of population]] had occurred, and that the Jews fleeing Arab countries constitute refugees equivalent in status to the estimated 750,000 Palestinian refugees forced to live in refugee camps in the [[Middle Eastern]] countries. Furthermore, Israel has charged that [[Palestinian refugees]] were neglected by most Arab nations, whereas Jewish refugees were integrated into Israeli society, and that this neglect is the true cause of the poverty and misery experienced by the residents of those camps, not their flight or expulsion from Israel as the Palestinians believe.

For the nineteen years from the end of the Mandate until the [[Six-Day War]], [[Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|Jordan controlled the West Bank]] and [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Egypt controlled the Gaza Strip]]. In 1950, Jordan annexed the West Bank, but this annexation was recognized only by the [[United Kingdom]]. Both territories were conquered (but not [[annexation|annexed]]) from Jordan and Egypt by Israel in the Six-Day War. Neither Jordan or Egypt allowed the creation of a Palestinian state in these territories.

===War of 1956===
The [[1956 Suez War]] was a joint Israeli-British-French operation, in which Israel invaded the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and British and French forces landed at the port of [[Suez]], ostensibly to separate the warring parties, though the real motivation of the United Kingdom and [[France]] was to protect the interests of investors in those countries who were affected  by Egyptian President [[Gamel Abdel Nasser|Nasser]]'s decision to [[nationalize]] the [[Suez Canal]].  Israel justified its invasion of Egypt as an attempt to stop attacks (see the [[Fedayeen]]) upon Israeli civilians, and to restore Israeli shipping rights through the [[Straits of Tiran]], which Egypt claimed was within its territorial waters. The invading forces agreed to withdraw under U.S. and international pressure, and Israel withdrew from the [[Sinai]] as well, in return for the installation of [[UNEF|U.N. separation forces]] and guarantees of Israeli freedom of shipment.  The canal was left in Egyptian (rather than British and French) hands.

===Between 1956 and 1967===
This period saw the rise of [[Nasserism]]; the founding of the [[United Arab Republic]] in 1958 and its collapse in 1961; disputes between Israel and Syria over water and border areas; continued [[fedayeen]] raids, mostly from Syria and Jordan, and Israeli reprisals; and the increasing alignment of the Arab states with the [[Soviet Union]], who became their largest arms supplier.

In the early 1960s, the [[PLO]] was established by Arab states. The Article 24 of the [[Palestinian National Charter]] of 1964 [http://www.palestine-un.org/plo/pna_two.html] stated: &quot;This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the [[West Bank]] in the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]], on the [[Gaza Strip]] or in the Himmah Area.&quot;

===War of 1967===
The [[Six-Day War]], 1967 began as a strike by Israel, which Israel and its supporters consider [[pre-emptive war|preemptive]], against Egypt and Syria following the Egyptian closure of the [[Straits of Tiran]] (a [[casus belli]], according to a possible interpretation of international law), a build up of troops along the Syrian border, expulsion of U.N. peacekeepers from the Sinai, stationing some 100,000 Egyptian troops at the peninsula, and a public announcement by Nasser that he intended to destroy Israel  [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1947-1974/7%20Statement%20by%20President%20Nasser%20to%20Arab%20Trade%20Unio]. (In fact Nasser had said this would be an objective only if Israel &quot;embarks on an aggression against Syria or Egypt&quot;). Surprise Israeli air strikes destroyed the entire Egyptian air force while still on the ground. A subsequent ground invasion into Egyptian territory led to Israel's conquest of the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[Sinai Peninsula]].  In spite of Israel's request to Jordan to desist from attacking it, both Jordan and Syria began to shell Israeli targets; Israel responded by capturing the [[West Bank]] from Jordan on [[June 7]], and the [[Golan Heights]] from Syria on [[June 9]].

===War of 1968-1970===
The [[War of Attrition]] was a limited war fought between [[Egypt]] and [[Israel]] from 1968 to 1970. It was initiated by Egypt as a way to recapture the [[Sinai]] from Israel which had occupied it since the [[Six-Day War]]. The war ended with a [[cease-fire]] signed between the countries in 1970 with frontiers at the same place as when the war started.

===War of 1973===
[[Image:Jom kippur war.jpg|right|thumb|250px|When the cease fire came into effect, Israel had lost territory on the east side of the Suez Canal to Egypt (show in red) but gained territory west of the canal and in the Golan Heights (shown in green)]]
The 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] began when [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] launched a surprise joint attack, on the Jewish day of fasting, in the [[Sinai]] and [[Golan Heights]]. The Egyptians and Syrians advanced during the first 24&amp;ndash;48 hours, after which momentum began to swing in Israel's favor. By the second week of the war, the Syrians had been pushed entirely out of the Golan Heights. In the Sinai to the south, the Israelis had struck at the &quot;hinge&quot; between two invading Egyptian armies, crossed the [[Suez Canal]] (where the old [[cease-fire]] line had been), and cut off an entire Egyptian army just as a [[United Nations]] cease-fire came into effect. Israeli troops eventually withdrew from the west of the Canal and the Egyptians kept their positions on a narrow strip on the east allowing them to re-open the Suez Canal and claim victory.

===War of 1978===
[[Operation Litani]] was the official name of [[Israel]]'s 1978 invasion of [[Lebanon]] up to the [[Litani]] river. The invasion was a military success, as [[PLO]] forces were pushed north of the river. However, international outcry led to the creation of the [[UNIFIL]] peacekeeping force and a partial Israeli retreat.

===War of 1982===
The [[1982 Lebanon War]] began when Israel attacked Lebanon, justified by Israel as an attempt to remove the [[Fatah]] militants led by [[Yasser Arafat]] from Southern Lebanon (where they had established, during the country's civil war, a semi-independent enclave used to launch [[terrorism|terrorist]] attacks on Israeli [[civilian]]s). The invasion was widely criticized both in and outside Israel, especially after the Israeli-backed Christian militia's [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] and ultimately led to the death of 20,000 Lebanese. Although the attack succeeded in exiling Arafat to [[Tunisia]], Israel became entangled with various local Muslim militias (particularly [[Hezbollah]]), which fought to end the Israeli [[occupation]]. By 1985 Israel retreated from all but a narrow stretch of Lebanese territory designated by Israel as the [[Israeli Security Zone]]. The [[UN Security Council Resolution 425]] confirmed ([http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20000618.sc6878.doc.html]) that as of [[June 16]] [[2000]], Israel had completely withdrawn its forces from Lebanon.

===Intifada of 1987-1993===
The [[First Intifada]], 1987-1993, began as an uprising of Palestinians, particularly the young, against the Israeli military occupation of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]]. The exiled PLO leadership in Tunisia quickly assumed a role, but the uprising also brought a rise in the importance of Palestinian national and Islamic movements. The intifada started by a group of young who started throwing rocks at the Israeli occupying forces in Jabalia (Gaza Strip) in December 1987. Children of Palestine were the leaders of this uprising and were called (Atfal Al-Hijara). The Intifada ended with the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] by Israel and the PLO.

===Gulf War of 1990-1991===
The [[Gulf War]], 1990-1991, began with the Iraqi invasion and annexation of [[Kuwait]] and did not initially involve direct military engagement with Israel. An international coalition led by the United States which included Arab forces was assembled to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. To draw Israel into the confrontation and fracture the multinational coalition, Iraq launched [[Scud]] missiles on Israeli cities and on Israel's nuclear facilities at [[Dimona]]. However, under strong pressure from the U.S. which feared direct Israeli involvement would threaten the unity of the coalition, Israel did not retaliate against Iraq and the multinational coalition ousted Iraqi forces from Kuwait. During the war, the Palestinian leadership and King [[Hussein of Jordan]] allied themselves with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Kuwait and other Gulf Arab monarchies then expelled more than 400,000 Palestinian refugees ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4089961.stm]) and withdrew their support from the Palestinian cause, which was one of the factors leading to the [[PLO]] signing the [[Oslo Accords]].

===Intifada of 2000===
The [[al-Aqsa Intifada]] began in late September, 2000, around the time Israeli opposition leader [[Ariel Sharon]] and a large contingent of armed bodyguards visited the [[Temple Mount]]/[[Al-Haram As-Sharif]] complex in [[Jerusalem]] and declared the area eternal Israeli territory.  Widespread riots and attacks broke out in Jerusalem and many major Israeli cities, and spread throughout the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]]. In the months after the death of [[Yasser Arafat]] on [[November 11]] [[2004]], the Intifada is largely thought to have come to an end. An Israeli Human Rights group [[B'Tselem]] estimated[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3694350.stm] the death toll to be around 4000.

==Reasons for the conflict==
The Arab-Israeli conflict is the result of numerous factors.  Reasons cited for the conflict therefore vary from participant to participant and observer to observer.  A powerful example of this divide can be found in opinion surveys of Palestinians and Israelis.  In a March, 2005 poll 63% of the Israelis blamed the failure of the Oslo Peace Process on Palestinian violence, but only 5% of the Palestinians agreed. 54% of Palestinians put the blame on Israeli policies, but only 20% of the Israelis agreed.[http://www.pcpsr.org/survey/polls/2005/p15ejoint.html]  It is therefore difficult to develop a single, objective reason for the conflict, so this article will present some of the arguments made by each side.

[[Image:Cia-is-map.gif|right|thumb|200px|Israel's existence as a [[Jew]]ish state and the future of the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]], and [[Golan Heights]] are at the center of the Arab-Israeli conflict.]]

====Arab hostility====
Many if not most Israelis believe that the conflict is largely a result of Arab attempts to destroy Israel, and that only Israeli military power stands between them and annihilation. 

They characterize the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], the [[1967 Six Day War]] and the [[1973 Yom Kippur War]] as attempts to destroy Israel. As evidence of this intent, pro-Israeli literature often places a heavy emphasis on statements made by Arab leaders during and preceding the wars. The following quotes are mainstays of pro-Israeli arguments:

*&quot;This will be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades.&quot; (by [[Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam]] Pasha, Secretary General of the [[Arab League]], in anticipation of victory over the new Jewish state in 1948 by the five invading Arab armies.  This quote is described by Isi Leibler (1972) and mentioned in letters to the New York Times in [[15 October]] [[1951]], and [[28 August]] [[1958]].

*&quot;I declare a holy war, my Muslim brothers! Murder the Jews! Murder them all!&quot; (Haj [[Amin al-Husseini]], the Mufti of [[Jerusalem]], and head of the [[Palestinian Arab Higher Committee]] [http://www.jewishstudentscanada.ca/voice/story10.html], the original quote purportedly comes from a &lt;!-- more accurate date? --&gt;1948 radio broadcast by the Mufti)

*After the withdrawal of the [[UNEF]], the ''Voice of the Arabs'' radio station proclaimed ([[May 18]] [[1967]]): &quot;As of today, there no longer exists an international emergency force to protect Israel. We shall exercise patience no more. We shall not complain any more to the UN about Israel. The sole method we shall apply against Israel is total war, which will result in the extermination of Zionist existence.&quot;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mf6.html]

*&quot;Our forces are now entirely ready not only to repulse the aggression, but to initiate the act of liberation itself, and to explode the Zionist presence in the Arab homeland. The Syrian army, with its finger on the trigger, is united....I, as a military man, believe that the time has come to enter into a battle of annihilation.&quot; (Syrian Defense Minister [[Hafez Assad]] ([[May 20]] [[1967]]) [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mf6.html])

*&quot;If Israel embarks on an aggression against Syria or Egypt...The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel.&quot; ([[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s speech to Arab Trade Unionists ([[May 26]] [[1967]]) [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1947-1974/7%20Statement%20by%20President%20Nasser%20to%20Arab%20Trade%20Unio])

*On [[May 30]] [[1967]], Nasser proclaimed: &quot;The armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are poised on the borders of Israel...to face the challenge, while standing behind us are the armies of Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, Sudan and the whole Arab nation. This act will astound the world. Today they will know that the Arabs are arranged for battle, the critical hour has arrived. We have reached the stage of serious action and not declarations.&quot; (Isi Leibler, ''The Case For Israel'', 1972, p.60.) After Iraq joined the Arab military alliance in [[June 4]], its president Abdur Rahman Aref announced: &quot;The existence of Israel is an error which must be rectified. This is our opportunity to wipe out the ignominy which has been with us since 1948. Our goal is clear - to wipe Israel off the map.&quot; (Leibler, p.18)

=====Israel is forced to fight in self-defense=====
[[Israel]]is generally claim that, when nations declare war against Israel, Israel by definition is then at war with them. Israelis claim that they have always preferred peace to war: 

[[UN Security Council Resolution 242|SC 242]], the [[Land for peace]] formula, was adopted on [[November 22]], [[1967]] in the aftermath of the [[Six-Day War]] and the [[Khartoum Resolution]], and called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for &quot;termination of all claims or states of belligerency&quot; and mutual &quot;acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence&quot; by Israel and the other states in the area, and recognized the right of &quot;every state in the area&quot; (in particular, Israel) to live &quot;free from threats or acts of force&quot; within &quot;secure and recognized boundaries&quot;. 

Immediately after the [[Six-Day War]], Israel maintains that it offered to return the [[Golan Heights]] to [[Syria]] and the [[Sinai Peninsula]] (including the [[Gaza Strip]]) to [[Egypt]] in exchange for peace treaties and various concessions, but that Syria and Egypt refused the offer and this offer was very soon withdrawn. [[Anwar Sadat]], the Egyptian President at the time, proposed negotiations towards peace with Israel in the early 1970s but Israel refused the offer, claiming that it held unreasonable preconditions. Later Israel signed the [[Camp David Accords (1978)]] with Egypt and subsequently withdrew from all Egyptian territory it occupied.

Israelis note that the English language version of SC 242 deliberately did not state '''all''' territories occupied during the conflict, as the framers recognized some territorial adjustments were likely and rejected previous drafts with the word '''all'''. The French language translation of the text did include the definite article. Some, but not Israel itself, consider that Israel complied with this sense of the resolution when it returned the [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]] to Egypt in 1982.

=====Israel has no partner for peace=====
[[Israel]] claims that it has demonstrated flexibility and understanding by bringing about the initiation of the [[peace process]], agreeing to painful concessions, and partially implementing them. As opposed to this, many Israelis consider that the predominant [[Palestinian]] views of the peace process do not recognize Israel's right to exist, and believe that the only real long-term [[Arab]] goal is the complete destruction of the [[Jewish state]].

=====Non-recognition of Israel's right to exist or existence=====
Many [[Israel]]is and supporters of Israel, and some [[Palestinian]]s and supporters of Palestine, take the view that the very existence of the state of Israel is at stake.  Most of the other parties to the dispute maintain formally that Israel should be recognized as a state, although some consider that it should be abolished. Some opponents of Israel do not even acknowledge its existence, refusing any contact with or mention of it, and instead describing it as &quot;The Zionist Entity&quot; with outdated land claims. 

Israelis argue that the continued Jewish presence in the area throughout the past three millennia, and the deep religious ties maintained by Judaism with the Land of Israel, give Jews a continuing and valid claim. Although the 1800 years preceding the establishment of Israel saw very limited Jewish presence, they emphasize that the destruction of the [[Kingdom of Israel]] and [[Jewish Diaspora]] were due to foreign conquests. They also point out that since antiquity, Jewish beliefs were frequently branded as &quot;obsolete&quot; (see [[Against Apion]], [[Supersessionism]]). It may also be noted that historical grounds are not the only reasons given for the establishment of a Jewish state.

Israelis regard many of the [[Arab]] criticisms against the state of Israel as threats to the state's existence, and say that against the multitude and power of the Arab states, there is only one Jewish state, which, they feel, should behave vigilantly, and assert its power in both a defensive and preemptive manner as deemed necessary.

====Issues of democracy and fairness====

====Treatment of Jews in Arab-ruled societies and vice-versa====
Some Israelis point to issues of unfair and prejudicial treatment of Jews in Arab-ruled societies historically [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mf15.html] and currently. Israelis claim that Arab countries such as [[Syria]] and [[Yemen]] do not give full rights and freedoms to Jews, and others (such as [[Saudi Arabia]]) do not even allow Jews to be citizens. The United Nations Human Development Reports [http://www.rbas.undp.org/] and human rights groups report that many Arab countries do not allow political opposition and other freedoms and lack [[checks and balances]] and [[separation of powers]].

They also argue that within Israel, Israeli Arabs are not subject to this type of discrimination.  They point to Israel's democratic system which protects the rights Jewish and Arab Israelis alike. Within the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|pre-1967 armistice lines]], Arab and other minorities are given freedom of religion, culture and political organization. Several Arab political parties have elected parliament members in the [[Knesset]]. Arabs are typically not conscripted into the Israeli military (though they are accepted as volunteers), so they will generally never have to fight their peoples. However, it is recognized that this can affect later job opportunities, as some jobs in Israel require previous military service. 

Based on injustice Jews experience today and have experienced in the past in Arab-ruled Nations, and their fairness in imposing this injustice on Arab Israeli citizens, Israel their right to resist imposition of Arab rule on Israel is justified.  

=====Islamic vs. other views of Land ownership=====
Some pro-[[Israel]]i views focus on differences in concepts of land ownership as a root source of conflict.   ''[[sharia]]'' (Islamic law) contains the concept of Waqf, revenue-generating property as religious endowment that, once established, is permanent in nature[http://i-cias.com/e.o/waqf.htm].  

Under some traditional interpretations, [[Muslim]] territory encompass all land that was ever under Muslim control.  The Hamas charter[http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&amp;Area=palestinian&amp;ID=SP109206] embraces this view of land ownership:  &quot;The Islamic Resistance Movement maintains that the land of Palestine is Waqf land given as endowment for all generations of Muslims until the Day of Resurrection. One should not neglect it or [even] a part of it, nor should one relinquish it or [even] a part of it. No Arab state, or [even] all of the Arab states [together], have [the right] to do this; no king or president has this right nor all the kings and presidents together; no organization, or all the organizations together - be they Palestinian or Arab - [have the right to do this] because Palestine is Islamic Waqf land given to all generations of Muslims until the Day of Resurrection. This is the legal status of the land of Palestine according to Islamic law. In this respect, it is like any other land that the Muslims have conquered by force, because the Muslims consecrated it at the time of the conquest as religious endowment for all generations of Muslims until the Day of Resurrection.&quot;

Some pro-Israeli views would argue that this concept of a permanent Waqf, while strongly held under Sharia law, is not agreed to internationally.  

=====Characterizations of Zionism as Racisism and Colonialism=====

Most [[Israel]]is see [[Zionism]] as merely the desire of [[Jew]]ish people to live as free people in the [[land of Israel]].  This opinion would argue that Zionism does not imply the superiority of Jews over any other nationality or ethnicity, and thus the characterization of Zionism as Racism is unfair.    

People of all races, colors and ethnic backgrounds live in Israel.  It is pointed out that Israeli Jews come from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds.   In the 1930s, ideas of a 'population exchange' of Arabs and Jews between Arab states and Israel were actually popular among Zionists.  In practice, most Jews living in Arab Nations in 1948 have currently left Arab countries: 2/3 have moved to Israel.  Zionism does not prohibit [[Arab]]s, [[Druze]], [[Bedouin]] and other non-Jews from living in Israel as well, although by most interpretations it requires a Jewish majority to be established.  While some extremist Israelis, (particularly supporters of [[Moledet]]) believe in the forced transfer of Arabs from Israel, although this is not a widely held view.  

Zionists hold that Zionism is not colonialism, since they claim it does not wish to enslave any other peoples or take over any lands other than the one in question, nor to exploit them, but rather is about allowing the Jewish people to have a state in one small area. They also point out that they are not representing an outsider colonial force but full-fledged movement of self-determination.

====Refugee issues====
=====Jewish refugees=====
Most of the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|Jewish population in Arab countries]] fled from their homes since the establishment of [[Israel]] in 1948 or were thrown out of the land, and nearly two-thirds have been absorbed by [[Israel]]. These Jews lost most of their property and continue to claim compensation. Although there have been invitations from Arab states, virtually none have shown interest in returning to their former homes, as they have integrated in their new homes or fear persecution in Arab states.

Many believe the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]] to Israel and the [[Palestinian exodus|Arab exodus]] from the [[land of Israel]] to the surrounding territory constitutes a legitimate form of population exchange.

=====Palestinian refugees=====
[[Israel]] does not recognize a Palestinian [[right of return]]. Property belonging to former Arab residents in Israel is confiscated under the ''Absentee Property Act''. 

Israel maintains that the General Assembly resolutions establishing the Right of Return are merely recommendations under International law, and in any event doubt that the refugees wish to &quot;live in peace with their neighbors&quot;. 

Jewish Israelis fear that if [[Palestinian]]s were allowed to return to [[Israel]], the Jews would become a minority and [[Israel]] would no longer be a [[Jewish state]]. Many believe that if surrounding Arab states integrate the Palestinian refugees hostilities could be diffused, and that the harsh treatment of refugees in Arab states is done deliberately by those states in order to keep the conflict alive.

Israel has stated that it is willing to allow a limited number of Arabs to immigrate on a humanitarian basis (such as the unification of families) and limited compensation for others in the framework of a comprehensive peace plan. Such discussions have yet to take place.

The text of the UN Resolutions refer to a &quot;just settlement of the refugee problem&quot; and do not specifically mention either the [[Palestinian refugees]] or the [[Jewish refugees]]. Israel's refusal to consider large-scale resettlement of Palestinian refugees is also based on the continued refusal of Arab nations to compensate Israeli Jews of Arab origin, many of whom were driven out of their home countries after facing the expropriation of their property.

====Settlements====
Israelis of the political right, particular in the  [[Likud]] party, strongly support settlements in the [[West Bank]].  The platform of the Likud party states that &quot;settlement of the land is a clear  expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the  Land of Israel and constitutes an important asset in the defense of  the vital interests of the State of Israel.&quot; [http://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm]

Liberal Israelis oppose settlements, believing they are illegal under the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] and/or thwart peace efforts. However, most Israelis do not view the building of houses and stores in [[Israeli settlement]]s as an act of war, and believe that disputes over land do not justify violent resistance or terrorism, but that there should be politically negotiated solutions. This view is rejected by Palestinians and many outside Israel, as Israel's leadership continues to build settlements on land they contend to be Palestinian, an activity that is roundly condemned by much of the world except Israel and usually the [[United States]].

Israel's supporters argue that the Fourth Geneva Convention does not technically apply to the territories, since they have no &quot;High Contracting Party&quot;, and claim that the Convention in any event only applied to forcible transfers of populations into or out of captured territories.  However, a conference of High Contracting Parties in 2001 stated that the Convention did apply in the territories.



===Palestinian and other Arab views===
''There is not a single &quot;Palestinian view&quot;; there are many different Palestinian views, which differ widely.''

====Illegitimacy or illegality of Israel====
=====A state based on outdated claims=====

=====Israel and international law=====
:''See also [[International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict]]''.

Palestinians claim they have [[International law]] on their side.

[[1947_UN_Partition_Plan|UN General Assembly Resolution 181]] orders that &quot;Independent Arab and Jewish States...shall come into existence in Palestine&quot;. Israeli founding father and author of Resolution 181 [[Abba Eban]] claimed that Israel &quot;tear[s] up its own birth certificate&quot; when it ignores UN resolutions.[http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=231659&amp;contrassID=3&amp;subContrassID=0&amp;sbSubContrassID=0]

Palestinians hold that Israel disregards the following UN resolutions/International Law provisions:

[[UN General Assembly Resolution 194]] calls for &quot;the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property&quot; not naming either [[Palestinian refugees]] or [[Jewish refugees]]. Palestinians hold that this resolution should allow for the [[Palestinian exodus]] to return to their homes in Israel. Israel has blocked the return of these refugees and confiscated their land as &quot;absentee&quot;.

[[UN Security Council Resolution 242]], adopted after the [[Six-Day War]], emphasizes &quot;the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every State in the area can live in security,&quot; and calls for &quot;withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict&quot; and for the recognition of the &quot;sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force&quot;. These territories occupied included the [[Gaza Strip]], [[Golan Heights]], [[West Bank]] and the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The [[Palestinian Authority]] intends eventually to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel maintains control of the West Bank and maritime/aerospace control of the Gaza Strip. 

The [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] forbids an occupying power from confiscating occupied land and transferring its own population to that territory.&lt;!--Over 88% of Israel proper is composed of land confiscated from Palestinian land owners.
:''Of the entire area of the state of Israel only about 300,000-400,000 dunums ... are state domain which the Israeli government took over from the mandatory regime [2 %]. The JNF and private Jewish owners possess under two million dunum [10 %]. Almost all the rest [i.e 88 % of the 20,225,000 dunums within the 1949 armistice lines] belongs at law to Arab owners, many of whom have left the country. (Jewish National Fund, Jewish Villages in Israel, p.xxi, quoted in Lehn and Davis, The Jewish National Fund)--&gt;&lt;!--That's not found in the Fourth Geneva Convention, nor is it an argument made by Palestinians.  It's a claim apparently made in a JNF document.  Furthermore, it is a dubious claim, since other statistics and sources explicitly contradict it.--&gt;

[[UN Security Council Resolution 446]] declares that the [[Israeli settlement]]s in the occupied Palestinian territories are illegal.[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/ba123cded3ea84a5852560e50077c2dc?OpenDocument]

====Issues of democracy and fairness====
=====Historical treatment of Jews in the Arab world=====
Many [[Muslim]]s and contemporary western Historians assert that [[Jew]]s were treated [[Islam and Judaism |better]] by Muslims than by other rulers who [[Persecution of Jews|persecuted]] them. One pertinent example is the mass expulsion of Jews from [[Spain]] after the fall of their last refuge there, the Muslim kingdom of [[Granada]] in 1492. This resulted in the [[Jew#Jews and Migrations|migration]] of Jews (especially those fleeing the [[Spanish Inquisition]]) to the [http://www.mersina.com/lib/turkish_jews/history/life.htm Ottoman Empire], including the present-day region of Israel and surrounding areas. Authoritative works summarizing Jewish treatment within Muslim lands written by Jews have concluded that although occasional violent persecution did occur, it was not systemic nor continuous and substantially better than treatment by Christians in the pre-modern era. (Lewis, 1984)

=====The creation of Israel as a cause of conflict=====
Supporters of this viewpoint regard historically good relations with much of the Middle East as having been shattered by the creation of Israel.  They cite the example of [[Mizrahi Jews]], who had long been living in large measure peacefully among Arabs and Muslims, but who left after the establishment of the state of Israel for a variety of reasons (depending on the country), including Muslim hostility because of the new state. Some point out as well that during the times of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], Muslim countries were prominent in accepting Jewish refugees.

Opponents of this viewpoint, including some Mizrahi Jews themselves, see this as one-sided at best. They point to the persecutions of the Jews of North Africa in the 12th century under the [[Almohades]], the slaughter of thousands of Jews in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] in 1465 (after the Jewish deputy vizier Harun (Aaron), who had imposed heavy taxes on the population on behalf of the vizier, was accused of treating a Muslim woman &quot;offensively&quot;), [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mf15.html#c] and to similar massacres in [[Libya]], [[Algiers]], and [[Marrakesh]] in the 18th and 19th centuries (Morris, 2001). They also point to waves of synagogue destructions and forced conversions throughout the Arab world from the 11th to 19th centuries, and to the fact that, by the 19th century, most Jews of North Africa were forced to live in ''[[mellah]]s'' or [[ghettos]], and were subject to a number of restrictions and humiliations.

=====Jewish immigration as a cause of conflict=====
Some Arabs maintain that there is nothing wrong with Jewish immigration into Palestine, in itself, any more than there is with Jewish immigration into any other part of the world. But in their view the [[Zionist]] immigrants arriving in Palestine from the late 1800s on did so in course of a plan to take it over and establish a Jewish majority state, in some cases by force; they consider this to be colonization of Palestinians' land, made possible not by Palestinian [[self-determination]], or even consent, but by British (and to a lesser extent Turkish) fiat.  This process led to what they regard as an expulsion by Zionists of the majority of the indigenous Palestinian population in 1948, and continues today with Israel's ongoing expansion of settlements.  Palestinians also decry what they see as the inherent inequity of long-standing Israeli laws on immigration where, according to Israel's Law of Return, a Jew born in, say Stockholm, may immigrate to Israel and gain automatic citizenship and elect to live anywhere he chooses, including [[East Jerusalem]], whereas a Palestinian born and raised in Jerusalem and forced to leave as a refugee of war may not return to his home.

The detractors of this argument regard the existence of a Jewish minority in the [[Land of Israel]] throughout the past two millennia, and the [[Jerusalem|importance of Jerusalem and the Land of Israel in Judaism]], as giving Jews a right to go there that trumps Palestinians' objections. They also claim international approval for their immigration, noting that both the [[League of Nations]]'s 1922 [[Palestine Mandate]] and the 1947 [[UN Partition Plan]] supported the establishment of a [[Jewish National Homeland]] in the region, and view the Arab leadership's former rejection of any partition as an attempt to deny the Jews their right of [[self-determination]]. They claim that a national homeland for Jews would have protected them from persecution.  [[General Zionism|Mainstream Zionists]] have argued that the land could support a greater population density without major population displacement.

=====Israeli treatment of minorities=====
Palestinians feel that the Jewish state of Israel was established under conditions that were deeply unfair to them. Some Palestinians do not oppose a Jewish state as such, but all Palestinians feel that it should not have been established at their expense. They argue that after World War II - and, indeed, after World War I - the world allowed a state for Jewish people in Palestine to be established without much concern for the existing indigenous Arab population.  According to this view, Palestinians were forcibly expelled from their homes by Jewish militias before and during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war (see [[Palestinian exodus]].)  Those who remained in Israel face various forms of discrimination, such as housing and employment discrimination. Many job opportunities in Israel are open only to those with previous military service, typically non-''[[haredi]]'' Jews, [[Druze]], [[Circassians]] and [[Bedouins]].  Those who do not serve in the IDF (typically [[Israeli Arab]]s and ''haredi''-Jews) are denied those opportunities.

Some Palestinian Christians are of the opinion that the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] has led to the diminishment of their population[http://christianactionforisrael.org/antiholo/hate_jews.html][http://www.amconmag.com/2004_05_24/article.html]. Others, like [[Abe Ata]] are of the opinion that American [[Christianity|Christians]] have &quot;turned their backs&quot; on them by supporting Israel [http://www.natcath.com/NCR_Online/archives/112202/112202r.htm].  Some Palestinian Christians have alleged that Israel does not give them permission to visit holy places in Jerusalem.[http://www.amin.org/eng/daoud_kuttab/2005/may20.html]

====Legitimacy of war against Israel====
As the refugees' exile continued, some Palestinian groups chose war, considering it as a necessary way to regain what they saw as their rights over the land they came from. The failure of these efforts to improve the Palestinians' condition fueled increased hostility.

Many Palestinians distinguish between violent resistance against Israeli military occupation, and violent acts against Israeli civilians. They hold that the former is legitimate resistance under the [[laws of war]], while the latter comprise illegitimate acts of terrorism.&lt;!-- However, opinion polls consistently show these Palestinians to be in the minority. --&gt; Other Palestinian voices reject violence altogether and look to exclusively non-violent resistance as a solution. Palestinians making the case for purely non-violent resistance, or for armed resistance against only military targets but not Israeli civilians, invoke both practical arguments that such tactics are counterproductive, as well as moral and legal arguments against the use of violence, especially against civilians. Most Palestinians claim that Israel's occupation engenders routine violence against Palestinian civilians that is institutionalized and carried out on a much larger scale than anything Israelis experience. They often question what they see as the media's one-sided use of the word &quot;terror&quot; in cases where Palestinians are perpetrators and Israelis are victims, while ignoring what they view as state terrorism carried out by Israel against the Palestinian population. 

Some Palestinian and Arab leaders believe that Palestinians are justified in using violence against any Israeli, seeing all Israelis as illegal occupants, and arguing that Israel's universal conscription renders almost all Israelis potential combatants. They see these illegal occupants as the source of tens of thousands of deaths, and millions of refugees. Some claim that trusting the international community to help them to get their rights back is useless, suggesting that, in recent history, as long as Palestinians were peaceful no state made any serious efforts to solve their problem. In their opinion, only when other countries see Palestinian problems as causing problems to themselves do they help Palestine.

They also argue that the civilian deaths caused by their operations are dwarfed by those dismissed as &quot;[[collateral damage]]&quot; caused by the full scale military campaigns done by various world powers. Some see the innocent deaths caused by such operations as regrettable, but as an only option to solve the problems of millions of Palestinians. Furthermore, they point to the use of violence against non-combatants by most other independence struggles, including, they say, the [[American War of Independence]].

Despite having underlying grievances in common, the relationships between the [[PLO and Hamas]] and other Palestinian factions is rife with philosophical and tactical differences, as well as frequent power struggles, all of which tend to work to Israel's advantage and weaken Palestinians' ability to influence the outcome of the conflict.

====Treatment of Palestinians====
Restrictions on Palestinian movements were introduced to increase levels of security within Israel and have been of variable severity over time. The international community often views these as punishments of the masses because of the actions of a few. This perception of unjust persecution provides a continuing rationale for hostility toward Israel.

Bulldozing of houses and destruction of infrastructure within Palestinian residential areas in the name of Israeli security add to the perceived poor conditions and lack of opportunities for the Palestinians. This is a frequently-used point of indignation used against Israel by Palestinian sympathizers.

Arab publications and others have compared [[Zionism]] to German [[Nazism]] and other historical examples of oppression and ethnic cleansing. Many Arabs, and others, believe Israel practices a form of &quot;[[apartheid]]&quot; against the Palestinian people, as bad as, or worse than, that practised by [[South Africa]], and that Zionism is a form of &quot;[[colonialism]]&quot; and has been carried out through extensive &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;. Pro-Israel advocates reply that these claims are non-factual and the comparisons are specious, or with assertions that such claims are hypocritical, since Arabs have created twenty-two Arab states, in some of which the remaining Jews are discriminated against. Palestinians hold that the existence of other Arab nations is irrelevant; they want to have the land they owned back, rather than being forced to throw themselves on others' charity in foreign countries. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics half of Jordan's population is ethnically Palestinian (former refugees and their descendants [http://www.pcbs.org/Portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/endyrrelse05e.pdf]) but the country is ruled by the Hashemite [[Bedouin]] family. In the 1970s, the PLO attempted to launch a [[Black September in Jordan|coup against the Jordanian monarchy]], which led to the death of some 20,000 Palestinians and the expulsion of the PLO from Jordan to Lebanon.

Israel's Family Reunification Law allows Interior Minister to grant permanent resident status to West Bank Palestinians who have family members in Israel. In his comment to the Knesset Interior Affairs committee on [[July 19]] [[2005]], [[Shin Bet]] Chief Yuval Diskin stated that &quot;11% of those involved in terror attacks are Palestinians who entered Israel via the Family Reunification Law.&quot; [http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/FPRI-6EFGS8?OpenDocument] [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3115064,00.html]

====Refugee issues====
[[UN General Assembly Resolution 194]] calls for &quot;the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property&quot;. Israel has blocked the return of these refugees and confiscated their land as &quot;absentee&quot;.

The supporters of Israel argue that the return of Palestinian refugees and millions of their descendents would mean the end of Jewish [[self-determination]] and assert the historical necessity for Jews to have a [[safe haven]]. See also [[Jewish refugees]].

====Jewish settlements in West Bank and Gaza====
Palestinians point out that Israel accelerated the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip throughout the Oslo peace process. These settlements are off limits to Palestinians and other Arabs, while any Jewish citizen of Israel can at any time choose to settle there. In 2000, at [[Camp David]], the Palestinians were offered a nominally independent state composed of discontiguous parts of most of Gaza and the West Bank, with Israeli control over its airspace, borders and trade. Led by Arafat, the Palestinians rejected this offer, claiming that this state would be a &quot;[[Bantustan]]&quot; (a state divided in many pieces) without sovereignty. President Clinton and the Israelis asked the Palestinians to offer a counter-proposal, but Arafat declined and returned to the West Bank. Later, further negotiations did take place, but they were terminated by the Israeli side. In his book ''The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace'', [[Dennis Ross]], the American ambassador and facilitator, asserts that the idea the Palestinian state would be a &quot;Bantustan&quot; was a myth, and provides maps showing an offer that included contiguous territory. [http://www.motherjones.com/news/qa/2004/10/09_404.html]&lt;!--Palestinians counter that Dennis Ross is not a credible source and a paid Israeli advocate.[http://www.pmwatch.org/pmw/cast/ross.asp]--&gt;&lt;!--This source no-where claims that Ross's maps are incorrect, or that a Palestinian state would indeed have been a &quot;Bantustan&quot;.--&gt;

During Fateh Central Committee meeting on [[September 5]] [[2005]], &quot;[r]eferring to the lands Israel would evacuate in Gaza Strip, President Abbas said that 97.5 % of these lands were state-owned lands&quot;[http://www.ipc.gov.ps/ipc_new/english/details.asp?name=10285].

====Arab willingness to make peace====
In 2002, Saudi Arabia offered a [[Arab Peace Initiative|peace plan]] in the [[New York Times]] and at a summit meeting of the [[Arab League]] in [[Beirut]]. The plan is based on, but goes beyond [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]] and [[UN Security Council Resolution 338|Resolution 338]].  It essentially calls for full withdrawal, solution of the [[Palestinian refugee|refugee problem]], and a [[Palestinian state]] with its capital in [[East Jerusalem]] in return for fully normalized relations with the whole Arab world. This proposal received the unanimous backing of the [[Arab League]] for the first time. 

In response, Israeli Foreign Minister [[Shimon Peres]] welcomed it and said: &quot;... the details of every peace plan must be discussed directly between Israel and the Palestinians, and to make this possible, the Palestinian Authority must put an end to terror, the horrifying expression of which we witnessed just [[Netanya suicide attack|last night in Netanya]].&quot; [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/About+the+Ministry/MFA+Spokesman/2002/Response+of+FM+Peres+to+the+decisions+of+the+Arab.htm]

In November 2005, the Bush administration acknowledged that Saudi Arabia has renewed funding to Hamas and other Palestinian insurgency groups. [http://www.menewsline.com/stories/2005/november/11_10_2.html]

====Palestinians as victims of extremism====
Some Palestinians believe that their cause may be damaged by extremists within their own ranks; an issue that is mirrored in the Israeli camp. Some view the conflict as essentially extremist vs. moderate, as opposed to Israeli vs. Palestinian. Pro-Israel advocates often assert that two sets of views exist from the same speaker, with a tolerant view usually expressed in English, and an anti-peace view usually expressed in Arabic, with pro-Arab advocates making similar charges about Israeli speakers. Most if not all Palestinian spokespeople declare that they wish Israel had never come into being, regarding its creation as a historic injustice.  However, some accept its existence today and call merely for a state of their own.  Still others envisage a one-state solution in all of historic Palestine.  Within this one-state view, there are both secular and Islamist visions for the future. The secular view holds that a just and lasting peace is most likely if there exists a fully democratic government for all citizens, where legal status and civil rights are not based on ethnic and religious identity.  The Islamist view aspires to an Islamic government in Palestine.  In both views, Jews currently living in Israel might be allowed to remain there unmolested as free and equal citizens of a future state of Palestine (in the secular Arab view) or as [[dhimmi]]s along with Druze and Christians, in the Islamist Arab view. Some Jews view it as extremely unlikely that they would be allowed to live unmolested in any sort of one-state Palestine.

Today, many Palestinians think that an equitable arrangement for all involved parties requires dialogue with Israelis and the international community. The PLO has officially accepted the right of Israel to exist within the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|pre-1967 armistice lines]]. However, some PLO representatives, including Yasser Arafat, have also declared at times that they saw these statements as politically necessary steps.  Some observers interpret this to mean that they view the two-state solution as a stepping stone to a more integrated long-term solution.  Others, particularly some Israelis, claim that these statements betray a hidden agenda and worldview where the peace process with Israel is only a temporary measure in support of the ultimate Palestinian goal, which is the destruction of the state of Israel, and presumably the eviction of its Jewish citizens. They point to the fact that the PLO never updated its formal statement of policy, the [[Palestinian National Covenant]] to reflect their recognition of the State of Israel and that it still calls for the destruction of Israel; however the U.S. Embassy in Israel is on record confirming that &quot;On April&amp;nbsp;24, 1996, the Palestinian National Council (PNC) amended the charter by canceling the articles inconsistent with its commitments to Israel&quot; [http://www.usembassy-israel.org.il/publish/peace/plo_note.html]. Still, belief in an existential threat from the PLO causes alarm among much of the Israeli public.

===Mutual claims===
====Biased text books====
Many Palestinian school textbooks, including those distributed and sponsored by the Palestinian Authority since 1994, have historically minimized or ignored Jewish history of the land prior to the twentieth century. Similar statements are made in the Palestinian media. Palestinians claim the newer batch of the textbooks, released in 2000, rectify any omissions. Palestinians also claim that Israeli textbooks and school curriculum fully ignore Palestinian history and propagate myths about the founding of Israel such as claims that Palestine was virtually uninhabited prior to the arrival of Zionist immigrants in the late 1800s and early 1900s.  Palestinians further claim that Israeli textbooks and media neglect and minimize the Arab Palestinian past and, according to Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace (CMIP), stereotype Arabs negatively[http://www.edume.org/reports/8/14.htm]; however the Israelis counter that the Israeli history program does include medieval Islamic history including topics such as the Arab [[Caliphate]], as well as some history of both Arab and Jewish elements of Palestine. CMIP regularly issues [http://www.edume.org/reports/report1.htm reports on the contents of Arab and Israeli school textbooks].

====The role of the superpowers====
Palestinians cite many reasons for the perceived lack of support of their cause in the United States, despite the perception that it is more broadly supported in Europe. One such reason is postulated to be ethnic bigotry in the U.S.; while stereotyping of many other groups is no longer rampant, many people believe that Muslims and Arabs, in particular, continue to be vilified and victimized by crude attacks. There is also strong influence by Christian [[Zionist]] organizations on elected officials in the U.S. political system (see [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee|AIPAC]] as one such example). It has also been argued that the U.S. continues to support Israel in order to have a strong foot hold in the region for their own national interests, politically and economically. Many also cite the political nature of the Cold War that aligned the U.S. with Israel against the USSR and its allies in the region.

The [[Soviet Union|USSR]] traditionally used Arabs as a proxy in the [[Cold War]] against the [[Western world]] (and the West's proxy in the Middle East, Israel). Some of today's [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] rhetoric still reflects the position of Soviet [[Zionology]].

===Peace and reconciliation===
Despite the long history of conflict between Israelis and Arabs, there are many people working on peaceful solutions that respect the rights of peoples on all sides. See [[projects working for peace among Israelis and Palestinians]].

'''''Anyone Can Whistle''''' is a [[Musical theater|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and book by [[Arthur Laurents]]. It is an imaginative fable about a town going through hard times due to having &quot;manufactured a product that never wore out&quot;, according to its narrator. The mayoress, Cora Hoover Hooper ([[Angela Lansbury]] in the original production), and the town council, Comptroller Schub, Treasurer Cooley, and Police Chief MacGruder hatch a scheme to provide the town with a &quot;miracle&quot; consisting of water pouring from a rock, in the hopes that it will bring tourists to the town and revive its failing economy. However, they are opposed by Fay Apple ([[Lee Remick]]), a nurse at the local sanitarium, The Cookie Jar, who brings her 49 patients (or &quot;cookies&quot;) to the miracle hoping to prove that it is a fake (which it is.) Eventually, her &quot;cookies&quot; escape, leaving the town council to determine &quot;which is what and who is who.&quot; Suddenly a new doctor (or so he claims), J. Bowden Hapgood ([[Harry Guardino]]), appears on the scene, who divides the town into &quot;Group A&quot; and &quot;Group 1&quot; claiming one group is sane and the other loony... but refusing to tell which group is what. However, nothing in the town is what it seems. As expected, hilarity ensues.

''Anyone Can Whistle'' was a financial failure, running only nine performances, but some critics saw it as a musical that was simply ahead of its time, and it has gone on to be a cult favorite, even though there has never been a major revival of the show. The Original Cast Recording, which was made after the show had closed, also has a strong following. Among the songs in the show are the title song, &quot;Me and My Town&quot;, &quot;Everybody Says Don't&quot;, and &quot;With So Little to Be Sure Of&quot;. &quot;There Won't Be Trumpets&quot;, a song cut from the show before its opening, has also become a cabaret favorite.

''Anyone Can Whistle'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the Majestic Theatre on [[April 4]], [[1964]], and closed after nine performances. Theatre wags often joke that if everyone who claimed to have seen the original production truly had, the show would still be running on Broadway.

In 1995 a concert reading of the show was performed at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York as a benefit for the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]]. The concert was recorded, preserving for the first time musical passages and numbers not included on the original Broadway cast recording. [[Angela Lansbury]] served as narrator, with [[Madeline Kahn]] taking on the role of Cora.  [[Bernadette Peters]] and [[Scott Bakula]] played Fay and Hapgood. Additional cast included [[Harolyn Blackwell]], [[Chip Zien]], [[Ken Page (Actor)|Ken Page]], and [[Harvey Evans]] -the only cast member to reprise his role from the original production.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alcopop''' is a term coined by the popular [[Mass media|media]] of the [[United Kingdom]] to describe bottled alcoholic [[beverage]]s that resemble sweet drinks such as soft drinks and lemonade.

In the [[alcoholic beverage]] [[industry]] they are known as '''RTD'''s ('''ready to drink''') or '''FAB'''s ('''Flavoured Alcoholic Beverages'''). These drinks, such as alcoholic [[lemonade]], tend to be [[sweet]], served in small [[bottle]]s (typically 200&amp;ndash;275[[Millilitre|ml]]), and between 5–7% [[alcohol by volume]].  In [[Europe]], alcopops tend to be pre-mixed spirits, including vodka (e.g. [[Smirnoff Ice]]) or rum (e.g. [[Bacardi Breezer]]).  In the [[United States]], alcopops are often [[hop (plant)|un-hopped]] [[beer]]s with added flavoring (&quot;malternative&quot; drinks), which are classified as beers and therefore can be sold in outlets that spirit based drinks could not be.

These drinks emerged onto the market in the mid-[[1990s]] with the launch of [[Merrydown]]'s [[Two Dogs]] and [[Hooper's Hooch]].  [[Zima]], introduced in 1994, was the first widely known and widely purchased alcopop.  Many more have followed, as the drinks became increasingly popular, especially with younger people.

Later, [[Mike's Hard Lemonade]] was released in the [[United States]], with humorous commercials depicting what they called &quot;violence against lemons&quot;. [[Smirnoff]] also came out with another [[citrus]]-[[flavour]]ed [[malt beverage]] in the United States in the late 90s called [[Smirnoff Ice]], which promoted itself with flashy commercials, usually involving trendy young people dancing in unlikely situations and places (In the UK [[Smirnoff Ice]], is marketed by [[Diagio]] as a [[Premium Packaged Spirits (PPS)|PPS]]).

Some parts of the media expressed intense concern that such drinks might appeal to [[child]]ren as they tend to be sweet and brightly coloured. Many [[Alcohol advertising|alcopop advertising campaigns]] have been criticised as trying to make alcopops appeal to young drinkers. However, the majority of those who consume such beverages in the U.S. are over age 27, according to the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (Federal Trade Commission, 2003). Nevertheless concern remains. As a result [[Germany]] has imposed an extra duty of 0.80 to 0.90 [[euro]] per bottle effective [[August 1]], [[2004]]. Some now carry a warning stating that they are not for consumption by minors (under 18 in the UK and 21 in the [[United States]]). Other sweet [[alcoholic beverage]]s that had been around for years, such as [[cider]], [[wine cooler]]s, and [[liqueur]]s, escaped this concern.

While the amount of [[beer]] being sold worldwide has dropped, the sale of alcopops has taken off dramatically. This is thought to be because the sweetness of alcopops appeals to younger drinkers more readily than the taste of [[wine]] or beer, and are less detectable on the drinker's breath.

'''Afrikaners''' are [[South Africa|South Africans]] of predominantly  [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], [[French people|French]] [[Huguenot]], [[German people|German]] [[Protestant]], [[Frisian]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]], and [[Walloon]] descent who speak the [[Afrikaans language]]. Afrikaners are also sometimes referred to as ''[[Boer]]s''  (Afrikaans for ''farmer'') as a significant percentage are descended from cultural Boers, but many Afrikaners now view this as a derogatory term. 

==History==
Afrikaners are mainly descended from northwestern European settlers and religious refugees who lived in the [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]] during the period of administration ([[1652]]-[[1795]]) by the [[Dutch East India Company]] (''Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie'' or VOC) and the subsequent period of British rule. The original colony at the Cape, which was started as a refreshment station for the VOC, was first settled by the Dutch in 1652. The arrival in 1688 of a small group of French [[Huguenots]] who were fleeing religious persecution in France infused new blood and swelled the settlers' numbers. Some settlers from other parts of Europe (e.g. [[Scandinavia]] and the [[British Isles]]) also joined the ranks of the Afrikaners. Non-Europeans (including [[Cape Malays|Malay]], [[Demographics of Madagascar|Malagasy]], [[South India]]n, [[Khoi]] and [[Bantu]]) makeup around 5-7% of Afrikaner origins. 

The Afrikaans language changed over time from the Dutch spoken by the first white settlers at the Cape. From the late 17th century, the form of Dutch spoken at the Cape developed differences in pronunciation and accidence and, to a lesser extent, in syntax and vocabulary, from that of the Netherlands, although the languages are still similar enough to be mutually intelligible (with some effort). Settlers who arrived speaking German and French soon shifted to using Dutch and later Afrikaans. The process of language change was influenced by the languages spoken by slaves, Khoikhoi and people of mixed descent, as well as by Cape Malay and Portuguese. While the Dutch of the Netherlands remained the official language, the new dialect, often known as Cape Dutch, African Dutch or &quot;Kitchen Dutch,&quot; developed into a separate language by the 19th century. In 1925 this new language replaced standard Dutch as one of the two official languages of the [[Union of South Africa]]

The term Afrikaner encompasses disparate communities of white Afrikaans speakers. Originally it distinguished those Dutch speakers who saw themselves as local, i.e. &quot;African&quot;, from those who still primarily identified with Europe; it was later used to distinguish between Afrikaans speakers and English speakers among the white population.  Its earliest use dates from [[1707]] but was not widely used until after the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]] of the early [[20th century]].  Prior to then, the various white Afrikaans speaking communities were known under different names. A significant number were known as Boers (farmers). The semi-nomadic/migrating farmers of the eastern frontier were known as Trekboers. Those who lived in the western Cape and did not trek eastward were known as the [[Cape Dutch]]. The isolated pioneers from the eastern Cape frontier who trekked (migrated into the interior) en masse in a series of migrations later known as the [[Great Trek]] (Groote Trek) were known as [[Voortrekkers]] (which may be translated as 'forerunners'). A small number of Voortrekkers came from the western Cape as well.   

In the [[1830s]] and [[1840s]] an estimated 12,000 Voortrekkers penetrated the future Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal provinces  putting themselves beyond the reach of British authority in order to escape relentless border wars, British colonialism including its Anglicization polices, as well as to ease pressure on an overcrowding frontier where land was becoming scarce. While some historians claim that these series of mass migrations, later known as the Great Trek, were caused because the Boers did not agree with the British restrictions on [[slavery]], the fact of the matter is most [[Trekboers]] did not own slaves, unlike the Cape Dutch, their more affluent cousins in the western Cape who did not trek eastward and migrate or participate in the Great Trek. The vast majority of Voortrekkers were Trekboers from the eastern Cape who engaged in pastoralism.  Nevertheless, the British promulgation of Ordinance 50 in 1828, which guaranteed equal rights before the law to all &quot;free persons of colour&quot;, was indeed a factor in Boer discontent, as is well documented by numerous contemporary sources; the various republics founded by the Voortrekkers while prohibiting slavery itself would all enshrine inequality by race into their constitutions. 

The Great Trek was mainly the result of the &quot;bursting of the dam&quot; of pent up population migration and population pressures, as Trekboer migrations eastward had come to a virtual stop for at least three decades (though some Trekboers did migrate beyond the Orange River prior to the Great Trek). During the ''Great Trek'' they fought against the [[Zulu]]s after Voortrekker leaders [[Piet Retief]] and [[Gerhard Maritz]], along with almost half of their followers, were lured under the pretence of a land treaty and massacred by King [[Dingane]] and his warriors, who occupied the best land in some of the areas the Boers were attempting to trek into. Although in revenge the forces of [[Andries Wilhelmus Jacobus Pretorius|Andries Pretorius]] killed about 3000 Zulus after the Boers initially came under attack in the [[Battle of Blood River]] in a classic mismatch between guns and spears. Retief and the local Voortrekkers had performed several deeds for [[Dingane]] and came to finalise the treaty in which the Voortrekkers were granted lands in [[Dingan]]'s kingdom before Dingane changed his mind killing Retief, his delegation, and half of the Natal contingent of Voortrekkers. The Zulu resistance changed the direction of the Trek. The emphasis moved from occupying lands which the Zulu held sway over east of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains to the west of them and onto the high veld of the [[Transvaal]] and Transorangia which was lightly occupied due to the devastation of the [[Mfecane]].

The Boers created independent states in what is now South Africa: the [[Natalia Republic]], the [[Transvaal]] Republic (the [[South African Republic]]) and the [[Orange Free State]]. The British wish to appropriate the gold and diamonds mines in the Boer areas led to the two Boer Wars: The [[First Boer War]] (1880-1881) and the [[Second Boer War]] (1899-1902), which ended with the inclusion of the Boer areas in the British colonies. The Boers won the first war, but lost the second after being one of the first people in modern times to employ guerilla tactics. Canada participated in this war being requested by its motherland. One of the first [[concentration camp]]s in the modern era were built for women, the elderly, and children of the Boers and their black allies. An estimated twenty seven thousand Boer civilians (mainly children under sixteen) died in the concentration camps marking a death of about 15 percent of the local Boer population. About 15,000 black allies died in other concentration camps as well.  A large number of the prisoners died under the British administration of the camps.  Following the British annexation of the Boer republics, the creation of the [[South Africa|Union of South Africa]] ([[1910]]) went some way towards blurring the division between British settler and Afrikaner.  The black majority, however, was excluded from equal participation in the affairs of the State and country, except for the states which were self governed ([[Qwaqwa]], [[Zululand]], [[Ciskei]], [[Transkei]], [[Venda]], [[Bophutatswana]]) until [[1994]], owing first to the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial policies and then later to an Afrikaner-led political party's policy of [[History of South Africa in the Apartheid Era|apartheid]], (the [[Afrikaans]] word for &quot;aparthood&quot; or &quot;separation&quot;), particularly under the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] from [[1948]].

==Today==
In recent years there has been an movement by some Afrikaners to support the mixed race (&quot;[[coloured]]&quot;) population of South Africa, most of whom speak Afrikaans as their first language, to consider themselves Afrikaners. The Afrikaans-speaking people who aren't [[Caucasian]] or who are Coloured people of South Africa, Nambia, and other Afrikaans-speaking locations, go by many names. These names include, &quot;[[kleurlinge]]&quot;, &quot;[[basters]]&quot;, &quot;[[griqua]]&quot;, &quot;[[namaqua]]&quot;, or &quot;[[khoikhoi]]&quot;. They are sometimes called &quot;bruin afrikaners&quot; (meaning '''brown Afrikaners'''), or &quot;bruinmense&quot; (meaning '''brown people'''). This has seen some success despite the history of exclusion during the colonial and apartheid eras. However, many Afrikaans-speaking coloureds feel they have developed a separate identity from [[whites|white]] Afrikaans speakers due to the strict [[racial segregation]] policies of the apartheid years.

Recently, some liberal Afrikaans-speaking South Africans and Namibians have started rejecting the label 'Afrikaner', because of its negative connotations of racism, conservatism and religious intolerance. Some use the racially neutral term &quot;Afrikaanses&quot; to refer to themselves as persons whose mother tongue is Afrikaans, disregarding racial identity or apartheid-era categorisation.

A group of Afrikaners has settled in the town of [[Orania]], with the goal of ultimately gaining a [[Volkstaat]] for Afrikaners as a result of Afrikaner demographic consolidation.

==Afrikaner versus Boer==
Currently, a number of white Afrikaans-speaking people, mainly with &quot;conservative&quot; political views, prefer to be called &quot;[[Boer|Boers]]&quot;, rather than &quot;Afrikaners&quot;. They feel that there were many people of [[Voortrekker]] descent who were not co-opted or assimilated into what they see as the [[Cape Province|Cape]]-based Afrikaner identity which began emerging after the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]] and the subsequent establishment of the [[Union of South Africa]]. 

They contend that the Boers of the [[South African Republic|South African]] (ZAR) and [[Orange Free State]] republics were recognized as a separate people or cultural group under international law by the Sand River Convention (which created the South African Republic in [[1852]]), the Bloemfontein Convention (which created the Orange Free State Republic in [[1854]]), the Pretoria Convention (which re-established the independence of the South African Republic [[1881]]), the London Convention (which granted the full independence to the South African Republic in [[1884]]) and the [[Peace of Vereeniging|Vereeniging Peace Treaty]], which formally ended the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]] on [[31 May]] [[1902]]. Others contend, however, that these treaties dealt only with agreements between governmental entities and do not imply the recognition of a Boer cultural identity ''per se''.  

The supporters of these views feel that the Afrikaner designation (or label) was used from the [[1930s]] onwards as a means of unifying (politically at least) the white Afrikaans speakers of the Western Cape with those of Trekboer and Voortrekker descent (whose ancestors began migrating eastward during the 1690s and throughout the 1700s and later northward during the [[Great Trek]] of the 1830s) in the north of South Africa, where the Boer Republics were established.

The supporters of the &quot;Boer&quot; designation view the Afrikaner designation as an artificial political label which usurped their history and culture turning &quot;Boer&quot; achievements into &quot;Afrikaner&quot; achievements. They feel that the Western-Cape based Afrikaners — whose ancestors did not trek eastwards or northwards — took advantage of the republican Boers' destitution following the Anglo-Boer War and later attempted to assimilate the Boers into a new politically-based cultural label as &quot;Afrikaners&quot;.

----

The word '''alkali''' can mean:-
*In [[chemistry]], an alkali is a specific type of [[Base (chemistry)|base]], formed as a [[carbonate]], [[hydroxide]] or other [[Ionic compound|ionic]] [[salt]] of an [[Alkali metal|alkali metal]] or [[Alkaline earth metal|alkali earth metal]] [[Chemical element|element]]. The word alkali or the adjective '''alkaline''' are frequently used to refer to all bases, since most common bases are alkalis, although such use is really a [[synecdoche]].
*In the western parts of the USA, natural soda or potash deposits (soda and potash themselves are both alkali salts).
*[http://www.tomlaidlaw.com/clickable/alkali.html Alkali Springs] is a place in [[Oregon]] in the USA.
*Alkali is also the [[NATO reporting name]] of the [[Kaliningrad K-5]] air-to-air missile.

== Common properties of alkalis ==

Alkalis are all [[Svante Arrhenius|Arrhenius]] bases and share many properties with other chemicals in this group (Arrhenius bases form hydroxide ions when dissolved in water). Common properties of alkaline solutions include:

* Alkalis all form [[aqueous]] [[solutions]].
* Alkalis are bitter to taste (compared with acid solutions which are described as sour).
* Caustic (causing chemical burns).
* Slippery or soapy to the touch (due to the caustic reaction dissolving the surface of the skin and fingerprint).
* Alkalis have a [[pH]] greater than 7 and hence can be detected with [[litmus]] paper (litmus will turn blue on contact with an alkali).
* Another common test for alkalis is the use of [[phenolphthalein]] since it turns from colourless to pink when the pH moves from 8 to 10 (making it suitable for detecting all but the most dilute solutions of alkalis).

== Confusion between base and alkali ==

The terms [[Base (chemistry)|base]] and '''alkali''' are often used interchangeably, since most common bases are alkalis. It is common to speak of &quot;measuring the alkalinity of soil&quot; when you actually mean measuring the [[pH]] (base property). Similarly, bases which are not alkalis, like [[ammonia]], are sometimes erroneously referred to as alkaline.

Note that not all or even most salts formed by [[Alkali metal|alkali metals]] are alkaline or even [[Base (chemistry)|basic]].

== Alkali salts ==

Most basic [[salt]]s are alkali salts.

Common alkali salts include:

* [[sodium hydroxide]] (often called &quot;caustic soda&quot;)
* [[potassium hydroxide]] (commonly called &quot;potash&quot;)
* [[lye]] (generic term, for either of the previous two, or even for a mixture)
* [[calcium carbonate]] (sometimes called &quot;free lime&quot;)

== Alkali soil ==

Soil with a pH above 7.4 is normally referred to as alkaline. This soil property can occur naturally, due to the presence of alkali salts. Although some plants do prefer slightly basic soil (including cabbage family vegetables and buffalograss), most plants prefer a mildly acidic soil (pH between 6.0 and 6.8), and high pH levels can cause a problem.

In alkali lakes (a type of [[salt lake]]), evaporation concentrates the naturally occurring alkali salts, often forming a crust of mildly basic 
salt across a large area.

Examples of Alkali Lakes:

Redberry Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada.

Tramping Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;alkali&quot; is derived from Arabic ''al qalīy'' = &quot;the calcined ashes&quot;, referring to the original source of alkaline substance. Ashes were used in conjunction with animal fat to produce [[soap]], a process known as [[saponification]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Ain't I a Woman?: Black women and feminism''''' is a 1981 book by [[bell hooks]] titled after [[Sojourner Truth]]'s &quot;[[Ar'n't I a Woman?|Ain't I a Woman?]]&quot;, ISBN 089608129X. Hooks examines the effect of [[racism]] and [[sexism]] on black women, the [[civil right]]s movement, and [[feminist]] movements from [[suffrage]] to the seventies. She argues that the convergence of sexism and racism during slavery contributed to black women having the lowest status and worst conditions of any group in American society. White female [[abolition]]ists and suffragists were often more comfortable with black male abolitionists such as [[Frederick Douglass]], while southern [[Racial segregation|segregation]]alists and stereotypes of black female promiscuity and immorality caused protests whenever black women spoke. Hooks points out that these white female reformers were more concerned with white morality than the conditions these morals caused black Americans.

Further, she argues that the stereotypes that were set during slavery still affect black women today. She argues that slavery allowed white society to stereotype white women as the pure goddess virgin and move black women to the seductive whore stereotype formerly placed on all women. This has allowed the justification of the devaluation of black femininity and rape which continues to this day. The work which black women have been forced to perform, either in slavery or in a discriminatory work place, that would be non-gender conforming for white women has been used against black women as a proof of their emasculating behaviour. bell hooks argued that [[black nationalism]] was largely a patriarchical and [[misogynist]] movement and thus that it sought to overcome racial divisions by strengthening sexist ones, that it readily latched onto the idea of the emasculating black ''[[matriarch]]'' proposed by [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] whose theories are repeatedly criticised by belle hooks. &lt;!-- The intended meaning here is a little unclear. --&gt;

Meanwhile, she says, the &quot;feminist movement&quot;, a largely white middle and upper class affair, did not articulate the needs of poor and non-white women, thus reinforcing sexism, racism, and [[classism]]. She suggests this explains the low numbers of black women who participated in the feminist movement in the [[1970s]], pointing to [[Louis Harris]]' [[Virginia Slims]] poll done in [[1972]] for [[Phillip Morris]] that she says showed 62 percent of black women supported &quot;efforts to change women's status&quot; and 67 percent &quot;sympathized with the women's rights movement&quot;, compared with 45 and 35 percent of white women (also Steinem, 1972). &lt;!-- Please verify the quoted sections are the exact phrasing of the survey. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''AMOS BASIC''' is a dialect of the [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] [[programming language]] implemented on the [[Amiga]] computer. AMOS BASIC was published by [[Europress Software]] and originally written by [[François Lionet]] with [[Constantin Sotiropoulos]]. It is a descendant of [[STOS BASIC]] for the [[Atari ST]]. AMOS BASIC was first produced in [[1990]]. 

AMOS competed on the Amiga platform with Acid Software's [[Blitz BASIC]]. Both BASICs differed from other dialects on different platforms, in that they allowed the easy creation of fairly demanding multimedia software, with full structured code and many high-level functions to load images, animations, sounds and display them in various ways.

The original AMOS version was [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreted]] which, whilst working fine, suffered from performance problems. Later, an AMOS [[compiler]] was developed, that reduced this problem.

After the original version of AMOS, Europress released two other versions: '''Easy AMOS''', a simpler version for beginners, and '''AMOS Professional''', a more advanced version with added features, such as a better [[Integrated Development Environment|IDE]], [[ARexx]] support, a new [[user interface|UI]] sublanguage and new flow control constructs. Neither of these new versions was significantly more popular than the original AMOS.

AMOS was mostly used to make [[Computer and video games|video games]] (platformers and graphical adventures) and educational software.

The language was mildly successful within the Amiga community. Its ease of use made it especially attractive to beginners.

Perhaps AMOS BASIC's biggest disadvantage was its incompatibility with the Amiga's [[AmigaOS|operating system]] functions and interfaces. Instead, AMOS BASIC controlled the computer directly, which caused programs written in it to have a non-standard user interface, and also caused compatibility problems with newer versions of the operating system.

Today the language has declined in popularity along with the Amiga computer for which it was written. Despite this, a small community of enthusiasts are still using it. The source code to AMOS has since been released under a [[BSD license|BSD style license]] by [[Clickteam]] - a company that includes the original programmer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Arcadia 2001''' is a second-generation 8-bit console released by [[Emerson Radio Corporation|Emerson Radio Corp]]. It was meant to outshine the [[Atari 2600]], but came out right before the more-advanced [[Atari 5200]] and the [[ColecoVision]]. It was a failure as soon as it came to market.  The game library was composed 51 unique games and about 10 variations. The graphics were similar to those of the [[Intellivision]] and the [[Magnavox Odyssey²|Odyssey²]]. The system is considered one of the biggest game console [[flop|flops]] of all time.

The Arcadia was not named after the company of the same name. Arcadia Corporation, makers of the 2600 [[Starpath Supercharger|supercharger]], was sued by Emerson for trademark infringement.  Arcadia Corporation changed its name to [[Starpath]].

==Description==
The Arcadia was originally intended to be a portable console, one can see that it was much smaller than it's competitors at the time. The console is powered by a standard 12-volt power supply, so it could be used in a boat, or a camper, and so on. This portability feature, however, required a portable television, which was extremely rare in the early 1980s. It also has two outputs(or inputs) earphones jacks types on the back of the unit, on the far left and far right sides.

The system came with two [[Intellivision]]-style control pads, but with a lighter touch on the side 'fire' buttons. The control pads have screw holes in their centers, so that one could transform them into a joystick, a la [[Gravis Gamepad]]. Most games came with mylar overlays which could be applied to the controllers. The console itself had five buttons: power, start, reset, option, and select.

There are at least three different types of cartridge case styles and artwork, with variations on each. Emerson-family carts come in two different lengths of black plastic cases; the short style is similar to Atari 2600 carts in overall size. This family uses a unique &quot;sketch&quot; type of picture label. MPT-03 family cart cases (see below) resemble Super NES carts in size and shape, except that they are molded in brown plastic. Their labels look much more modern and stylized, with only a minimal picture on each. There are also a family of what look like pirate carts, that look nothing like the others in shape, size or label artwork. The different labeled versions however all used the same cartridges.

==Market Failure==
The console was essentially considered dead upon arrival. The system came out at the same time that much better systems came onto the market — the [[Atari 5200]] and [[ColecoVision]] — which immediately crushed sales. In addition, Atari's use of exclusive rights to many games made it very virtually impossible for Emerson to get popular games to the console.

Emerson actually created many popular arcade titles including [[Pacman]], [[Galaxian]] and [[Defender]] for the Arcadia and had them manufactured. However, Atari started to sue it's competitors for companies that it had exclusive-rights agreements and Emerson was stuck with thousands of manufactured games that could no longer be sold.

Today, only a very limited number of console collectors even bother to go after the Arcadia.

==Variants==
Unlike almost all other consoles, the Arcadia 2001 was sold from many different firms under different names:

These include:

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[geometry]], the '''Andreini [[tessellation]]s''' are the complete set of 28 [[tessellation of space|uniform (space-filling) honeycombs of 3-space]]. They are the three dimensional equivalent to the [[List of uniform planar tilings|uniform tilings of the plane]]. They are named in honor of ''A. Andreini'' who studied and enumerated these tessellation forms around 1905. (See references below)

A uniform honeycomb is constructed by identical sets of convex uniform polyhedral cells around each vertex. Uniform cells can include the 5 [[Platonic solid|Platonic]], 13 [[Archimedean solid]]s, and infinite sets of uniform [[prism (geometry)|prisms]] and [[antiprism]]s.

The 28 tessellations can be divided into 4 groups by the existence of parallel uniform polygon-tiled planes:
# 10 are tessellations with no planar face-tilings.
# 12 are formed by stacked prisms of the 11 planar face-tilings.
# 1 has alternate planes of vertices, but only has one planar face-tiling.
# 5 have alternate planes of vertices with both planar face-tiled.

Note: See [[Uniform polychoron#Geometric derivations]] for some terminology for some of these names below.

These groups are listed largely in order of least to most polyhedra per vertex. The first group has 4 to 6 polyhedra per vertex, while the last has 12 to 14!

The listing below follows the four groups, and orders them by [n/m] where '''n''' is the number of cells per vertex, and '''m''' is the number of types of cells.

The (I) and (II) forms have the same vertex polyhedra, but repeat differently. The (II) forms have a rotation symmetry group. 

All 28 Andreini tessellations are found in [[crystal]] arrangements.

The [[Tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb]] is of special importance since its vertices form a cubic [[close-packing]] of spheres. The space-filling [[truss]]es of packed octahedra and tetrahedra was apparently first discovered by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and independently re-discovered by [[Buckminster Fuller]] (who called it the [[octet truss]] and patented it in the 1940s)

[[Image:Oswald shot by Ruby (Pulitzer).jpg|right|250px|thumbnail|[[Jack Ruby]] murdered [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the alleged assassin of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], in a very public manner.]]

In its most common use, '''assassination''' has come to mean the [[murder]] of an important person. An assassin — one who carries out the assassination — is usually [[ideology|ideologically]]- or [[politics|politically]]-motivated. Other motivations may be [[money]] in the case of a [[contract killing]]; opposition to a person's [[belief]]s or belief systems in the case of a [[fanatic]]; orders from a [[government]] that are often carried about by a subversive agent such as a [[secret agent|spy]]; or [[loyalty]] to a competing leader or group. Assassination, like companion terms such as [[terrorism]] and [[freedom fighter]], is often considered to be a [[loaded (language)|loaded term]]. However, while few call themselves terrorists, most assassins appear comfortable enough with their deed to describe it as such publicly. ''Targeted killing'' is sometimes preferred by governments, naming a controversial strategy whereby anticipated acts of [[terrorism]] are prevented by assassinating a person deemed to be related to those acts. According to ''The [[American Heritage Dictionary]]'', &quot;To [[murder]] (a prominent person) by surprise attack, as for political reasons.&quot;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=assassination]

==Etymology==
The term ''Assassin'' originally referred to a Muslim [[Order (religious)|order]] known as the [[Hashshashin]]. According to one derivation, the word means &quot;those who use [[hashish]]&quot; ([[cannabis]] resin) in Arabic because, according to Crusader histories, that group used to ingest hashish before carrying out military or assassination operations, in order to be fearless. The group, known as the Nizari [[Ismaili]]s, was a [[Shi'a Islam|Shia]] order who believed in the notion of the hazir [[imam]] and was organized as a secret underground political order, which infiltrated areas under the control of [[Seljuk Turks]]. In 1090 the sect captured a castle called [[Alamut]] in the mountains of Northern [[Iran]].  This sect was said to carry out assassinations of the enemies of the order, or Muslim rulers they believed to be [[piety|impious]]. The earliest known record of the word in [[English language|English]] dates back to 1603, referring to this sect rather than its more general modern sense. Similar words had earlier appeared in [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].

However, according to another derivation, the word Hashshashin derives from the  Arabic word hassas, from the root hassa, meaning &quot;to shoot&quot;.

Another version says that the word Hashshashin has the meaning of followers of Hassan, who would have been the order's first leader and founder.

[[Benjamin of Tudela]] provided the first western account of the sect. [[Marco Polo]]'s elaborate account is probably fictionalized in part. He said that recruits were promised [[heaven|Paradise]] in return for dying in action. They were drugged, often with materials such as [[hashish]] (although some suggest [[opium]] and [[wine]] instead, despite all three drugs being condemned by Islamic religious authorities and interpretations of the time) then spirited away to a garden stocked with attractive and compliant women and fountains of wine. At this time, they were awakened and it was explained to them that such was their reward for the deed, convincing them that their leader, [[Hassan-i-Sabah]], could open the gates to Paradise. The name ''assassin'' is derived from either ''hasishin'' for the supposed influence of their attacks and disregard for their own lives in the process, or ''hassansin'' for their leader. All this history, however, is tenuous, as it relies entirely on crusader-authored histories which have been traditionally very unreliable for information about native cultures.

Nowadays it is known that &quot;hashishinnya&quot; was an offensive term used to depict this cult by its Muslim and Mongolian detractors; the extreme zeal of Nizarites and the very cold preparation to murder makes it very unlikely they ever used drugs, while there is evidence that one of the first of Hassan's sons was sentenced to death by his father only for drinking a little wine. Moreover, despite many unlikely legends, they usually died along with their target (a tale tells of a mother being sad knowing her son survived a &quot;mission&quot;). As far as known they only used daggers (no other weapons, poison or whatever fictional records make them use) and it seems that they killed only five westerners during the time of the Crusades.

==Definition problems==
[[Image:King Alexander murdered on 9 oktober 1934.jpg|thumb|250px|Assassination of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] ]]
Unlike some topics, notably terrorism, wherein there is a substantial [[grey area]] and often bitter controversy between which specific instances qualify or even what standards should be used, the &quot;[[common sense]]&quot; classification of assassination stated at the outset of this article seems to stand with few objections. However, this does open larger issues concerning interpretation, notably regarding attempted killings by those with other motives — is it an assassination simply if the person is a major leader or public figure espousing a cause, or only if the assassin's reason for the attack is due to that person's status as a figurehead for a particular issue?

Notable instances in which this definitive problem might come into effect include the attempt on the life of [[United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] by [[John Hinckley]], who was determined subsequently to have serious psychological problems and publicly stated his intent was to get the attention of actress [[Jodie Foster]] rather than make any political statement. The killing of former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[John Lennon]] would raise the same problem — despite Lennon's outspokenness on many liberal political issues, his killer does not seem to have been more than an unstable [[Fan (aficionado)|fan]]. The use of the term &quot;assassination&quot; to describe Lennon's murder is a matter of some additional debate, since Lennon was primarily an entertainer, not a political figure, and it could be argued that describing his killing as an assassination is no more appropriate than, for example, using the term to describe the murders of singers [[Selena Quintanilla]] or [[Marvin Gaye]]. In another example, although [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] suggest the apparent suicide of [[Marilyn Monroe]] might have been a politically motivated murder, the term &quot;assassination&quot; is rarely, if ever, used in this context. The attempt on the life of President [[Gerald Ford]] by a member of [[Charles Manson]]'s [[cult]] could be the same; while it might perhaps be considered part and parcel of the anti-government, neo-fascist ideology to which Manson and his group adhered, [[Lynette Fromme|Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme]], the assassin, was not widely considered legally competent in her judgment at the time (although she was later tried and convicted). Should these cases be classified as attempted assassinations? The issue is further complicated by the fact that while Lennon was likely as outspoken politically as Reagan and Ford, and certainly as famous, Reagan and Ford were elected officials at the time, possibly requiring different criteria for Lennon's case.

One can take one of three positions (note that this consideration is of necessity strictly based upon language, not law): that the killing of someone ''only for political, moral, or ideological reasons'' constitutes an assassination (hence neither Reagan nor Lennon were the victims of assassins' attacks, while Ford was), that the killing of someone ''serving in politics or public office'' counts (thus Reagan's and Ford's attackers were would-be assassins, while Lennon's killer was not), or that anyone ''with a significant level of political involvement'' would be an assassination victim in the event of their murder (in which case all three instances would be assassinations or attempts).

While it must be acknowledged that attempting to read a person's thoughts is both imperfect and somewhat antithetical to the nature of such an issue, for the purposes of this article, the first, most conservative definition is taken. Although it is likely that the second is the most popular, the first is technically the most correct, and the third is generally considered to be too general in application. Therefore, all assassinations or attempts mentioned in the article will strictly follow the guidelines outlined at the outset to prevent confusion.

== Assassinations in history ==

==== Ancient history ====

Some would argue that assassination is one of the oldest tools of [[power politics]], dating back to the earliest governments of the world.

Towards the end of the [[Warring States Period]] (3rd century BC) in China, the state [[Qin]] rose to hegemony over other states. The Prince of the state Yan felt the threat and sought to remove the Qin king (later [[Qin Shi Huang]]) and sent [[Jing Ke]] for the mission. The assassination attempt was foiled and Jing Ke was killed on the spot.

[[Philip II of Macedon]], the father of [[Alexander the Great]], can be viewed as a victim of assassination. It is a fact, however, that by the fall of the Roman Republic assassination had become a commonly-accepted tool towards the end not only of improving one's own position, but to influence policy — the killing of Gaius [[Julius Caesar]] being a notable example, though many [[Emperors of Rome|Emperors]] met such an end. In whatever case, there seems to have not been a good deal of moral indignation at the practice amongst the political circles of the time, save, naturally, by the affected.

As the [[Middle Ages]] came about from the [[fall of the Roman Empire]], the moral and ethical dimensions of what was before a simple political tool began to take shape. Although in that period intentional [[regicide]] was an extremely rare occurrence, the situation changed dramatically with the [[Renaissance]] when the ideas of ''tyrannomachy'' (i.e. killing of a King when his rule becomes tyrannical) re-emerged and gained recognition. Many a head of state of the time fell at the hands of an assassin, such as [[Henri III of France|Henri III]] and [[Henry IV of France]]. There were notable detractors, however; [[Abd-ul-Mejid]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] refused to put to death plotters against his life during his reign.

=== Modern history ===
[[Image:Shot Dead on Arrival.JPG|left|thumb|[[Ninoy Aquino]], [[Philippines]]' President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]' top political nemesis, was shot dead by an alleged assassin in 1983, who was later killed by military escorts of Aquino. Investigations later concluded that one of the escorts shot the late senator.]] 

As the world moved into the present day and the stakes in political clashes of will continued to grow to a global scale, the number of assassinations concurrently multiplied. In [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] alone, five emperors were assassinated within less than 200 years - [[Ivan VI of Russia|Ivan VI]], [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. The most notable assassination victim within early [[American history|U.S. history]] was President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Three other U.S. Presidents have been assassinated: [[James Garfield]], [[William McKinley]], and [[John F. Kennedy]]. An assassination plot against [[Jefferson Davis]], known as the [[Dahlgren Affair]], may have been initiated during the [[American Civil War]]. In [[Europe]] the assassination of [[Archduke]] [[Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] triggered [[World War I]]. However, the 20th century likely marks the first time [[nation-state]]s began training assassins to be specifically used against so-called enemies of the state. During [[World War II]], for example, [[MI6]] trained a group of [[Czechoslovakia]]n operatives to kill the [[Nazi]] [[general]] [[Reinhard Heydrich]] (who did later perish by their efforts - see [[Operation Anthropoid]]), and repeated attempts were made by both the British MI6, the American [[Office of Strategic Services]] (later the [[CIA|Central Intelligence Agency]]) and the Soviet [[SMERSH]] to kill [[Adolf Hitler]].

=== Cold War ===

The [[Cold War]] saw a dramatic increase in the number of political assassinations, likely due in large part to the [[ideology|ideological]] polarization of most of the [[first world|First]] and [[second world|Second worlds]], whose adherents were more than willing to both justify and finance such killings. During the Kennedy era [[Fidel Castro]] narrowly escaped death on several occasions at the hands of the CIA (a function of the agency's &quot;[[executive action]]&quot; program) and CIA-backed rebels (there are accounts that exploding clams and poisoned shoes were employed); some allege that [[Salvador Allende]] of [[Chile]] was another example, though specific proof is lacking.  At the same time, the [[KGB]] made creative use of assassination to deal with high-profile defectors such as [[Georgi Markov]], and [[Israel]]'s [[Mossad]] made use of such tactics to eliminate [[Palestinian]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], politicians and revolutionaries, though some Israelis argue that the targeted often crossed the line between one or another or were even all three.

Most major powers were not long in repudiating such tactics, for example during the presidency of [[Gerald Ford]] in the United States in 1976 ([[Executive Order 12333]], which proscription was relaxed however by the [[George W. Bush administration]]). Many allege, however, that this is merely a smoke screen for political and moral benefit and that the covert and illegal training of assassins by major intelligence agencies continue, such as at the [[School of the Americas]] run by the United States. In fact, the debate over the use of such tactics is not closed by any means; many accuse [[Russia]] of continuing to practice it in [[Chechnya]] and against Chechens abroad, as well as Israel in Palestine and against Palestinians abroad (as well as those Mossad deems a threat to Israeli national security, as in the aftermath of the [[Munich Massacre]] during &quot;Operation Wrath of God&quot;). Besides [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] members assassinated abroad, [[Tsahal]] has also often targeted [[Hamas]] activists in the [[Gaza strip]].

=== In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ===

In the course of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) employed what they call &quot;focused foiling&quot; ({{lang-he|סיכול ממוקד }} ''[http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9C_%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%93 sikul memukad]'') against those who has been proven to have intentions of performing a specific act of violence in the very near future or to be linked indirectly with several acts of violence (organizing, planning, researching means of destruction etc), thus raising the likelihood that his or her assassination would foil similar activities in the future. Usually, the strike is carried out by [[Israeli Air Force]] attack helicopters that fire [[guided missile]]s toward the target, after the [[Shin Bet]] supplies [[military intelligence|intelligence]] for the target.

The exact nature of said proof in focused foiling situations is both controversial and classified, as it involves clandestine [[military intelligence]] oriented means and operational decisions made by intelligence officers and commanders rather than being a part of a published justice system executed by lawyers and judges.

The IDF claims that targeted killings are only pursued to prevent future [[terrorism]] acts, not as revenge for past activities. It also claims that this practice is only used when there is absolutely no practical way of foiling the future acts by other means (e.g., arrest) with minimal risk to the soldiers or civilians. Finally, IDF claims that the practice is only used when there is a certainty in the indentification of the target, in order to minimize harm to innocent bystanders. However, these IDF claims have never been monitored or validated by an independent authority, and the IDF deliberations about the killings remain secret. Moreover, actual injury and death of innocent bystanders, unintended as they may be, remains a strong claim by opponents of these targeted killings.

Targeted killings are largely supported by Israeli society to various extents, but there are exceptions: In 2003, 27 [[Israeli Air Force|IAF]] Air Force pilots composed a letter of protest to the Air Force commander [[Dan Halutz]], announcing their refusal to continue and perform attacks on targets within Palestinian population centers, and claiming that the occupation of the Palestinians &quot;morally corrupts the fabric of Israeli society&quot;. This letter, the first of its kind emanating from the Air Force, evoked a storm of political protest in Israel, with most circles condemning it as dereliction of duty. IDF ethics forbid soldiers from making public political affiliations, and subsequently the IDF chief of staff announced that all the signatories would be suspended from flight duty, after which some of the pilots recanted and removed their signature.

Some of the best known targeted killings by Israeli military were [[Hamas]] leaders [[Salah Shahade]] ([[July 2002]]), [[Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]] ([[March 2004]]), [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi]] ([[April 2004]]) and [[Adnan al-Ghoul]] ([[October 2004]]).

While the term &quot;targeted killing&quot; is mostly used within the context of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] by airborne attacks, [[Israeli security forces]] have reportedly assassinated top terrorists in the past, although this was never confirmed officially. Some of the best known operations include:
* [[Operation Wrath of God]] against [[Black September (group)|Black September]] perpetrators of the [[1972]] [[Munich massacre]]
* [[Operation Spring of Youth]] against top PLO leaders in [[Beirut, Lebanon]], [[1973]]
* [[Abu Jihad]] ([[Fatah]]) in [[Tunis]], [[1988]]
* [[Fathi Shaqaqi]] ([[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]]) in [[Malta]], [[1995]]
* [[Yahya Ayyash]] (Hamas bombmaker, &quot;the engineer&quot;) in [[Gaza]], [[1996]]
* [[Khaled Mashal]] (Hamas, foiled) in [[Jordan]], [[1997]]

=== United States ===
In [[1981]], President [[Ronald Reagan]] issued [[Executive Order 12333]], which codified a policy first laid down in 1976 by the [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] administration. It stated, &quot;No person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination.&quot;[http://cfrterrorism.org/policy/assassination_print.html]

In [[1986]], the American air strikes against [[Libya]] included an attack on the barracks where [[Muammar Qaddafi]] was known to be sleeping. During the [[1991 Gulf War]], the United States struck many of Iraq’s most important command bunkers with [[bunker buster|bunker-busting bomb]]s in hopes of killing Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]].

Since the rise of [[al-Qaeda]], both the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administrations have backed targeted killings. In [[1998]], in retaliation for the al-Qaeda attacks on U.S. embassies in [[East Africa]], the Clinton administration launched [[cruise missile]]s against a training camp in [[Afghanistan]] where [[bin Laden]] had been hours before. Reportedly, the United States nearly killed the leader of [[Taliban]], [[Mullah Omar]], with a Predator-launched Hellfire missile on the first night of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. In May [[2002]], the CIA launched a Hellfire missile from a Predator drone in an effort to kill the Afghan warlord [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]].

On [[November 3]], [[2002]], a US [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-operated [[RQ-1 Predator]] [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) fired a [[Hellfire missile]] that destroyed a car carrying six suspected al-Qaeda operatives in [[Yemen]]. The target of the attack was [[Abu Ali al-Harithi|Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi]], the top al-Qaida operative in Yemen. Among those killed in the attack was a US citizen, Yemeni-American [[Ahmed Hijazi]]. &lt;!-- THE ARTICLE SAYS Kamal Derwish --&gt;

According to Bush administration, the killing of an American in this fashion was legal. &quot;I can assure you that no constitutional questions are raised here. There are authorities that the president can give to officials. He's well within the balance of accepted practice and the letter of his constitutional authority,&quot; said [[Condoleezza Rice]], the US [[national security adviser]]. [http://timeenoughforlove.org/saved/YahooNewsU_S_CanTargetAmericanal-QaidaAgents.htm], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/2404425.stm]

During the press-conference, the [[US State Department]] spokesman [[Richard Boucher]] said that Washington's reasons for opposing the targeted killings of Palestinians might not apply in other circumstances and denied allegation that by staging the Yemen operation the US may be using [[double standard]]s towards Israeli policy: &quot;We all understand the situation with regard to Israeli-Palestinian issues and the prospects of peace and the prospects of negotiation... and of the need to create an atmosphere for progress... A lot of different things come into play there... Our policy on targeted killings in the Israeli-Palestinian context has not changed.&quot; [http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1106-06.htm]

On [[December 3]], [[2005]], the US was blamed for another incident, in which alleged al-Qaeda #3 man (operations chief [[Abu Hamza Rabia]]) was reportedly killed in [[Pakistan]] by an airborne missile, together with four associates. However Pakistani officials claim the group was killed while preparing explosives, not from any targeted military operation ([http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/12/03/pakistan.rabia/index.html], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4494428.stm]). The US has made no official comment about the incident.

On [[January 13]], [[2006]] US [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-operated [[unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned]] [[RQ-1 Predator|Predator]] drones launched four [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire missiles]] into the [[Pakistan]]i village of [[Damadola]], about 7 km (4.5 miles) from the [[Afghan]] border, killing at least 18 people. The attack targeted [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] who was thought to be in the village. Pakistani officials later said that al-Zawahiri was not there and that the U.S. had acted on faulty intelligence.

[[Image:Death of Inejiro Asanuma.jpg|right|250px|thumbnail|The assassination of Japanese politician Inejiro Asanuma, caught on camera.]]

The [[Russian Federation]] employed similar strategy in the course of its [[Chechen War]]s, targeting the leaders of separatist movement. Chechen President [[Dzhokhar Dudaev]] was killed by an air strike of [[Russian Air Force]] on [[April 21]], [[1996]] and [[Aslan Maskhadov]] was killed on [[March 8]], [[2005]]. 

&quot;When terrorists feel they are literally being trailed, fighting groups are systematically being detained, when in fact a top leader is eliminated, this creates an atmosphere in which there’s no place for terrorist attacks,” said Vladimir Vasilyev, head of the security committee of the lower house of the Russian [[State Duma]].[http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/03/10/maskhimpl.shtml]


===Assassination for money===
Individually, too, people have often found reasons to arrange the deaths of others through paid intermediaries. One who kills with no political motive or group loyalty who kills ''only'' for money is known as a [[hitman]] or contract killer. Note that by the definition accepted above, while such a killer is not, strictly speaking, an assassin, if the killing is ordered and financed towards a political end, then that killing must rightly be termed an assassination, and the hitman an assassin by extension (in the same way that a ''[[Manchurian Candidate]]''-style killer would be an assassin because, though they have been brainwashed to kill and have therefore no political aims, those that brainwashed them do have such aims, and if the killing can be termed an assassination, the killer must be an assassin).

Entire organizations have sometimes specialized in assassination as one of their services, to be gained for the right price. Besides the original [[hashshashin]], the [[ninja]] clans of [[Japan]] were rumored to perform assassinations — though it can be pointed out that most of what was ever known about the ninja was [[rumor]] and [[hearsay]]. In the [[United States]], [[Murder Incorporated]], an organization partnered to the [[Mafia]], was formed for the sole purpose of performing assassinations for organized crime. In [[Russia]], the ''vory'' (thieves), their version of the Mafia, are often known to provide assassinations for the right price, as well as engaging in it themselves for their own purposes.

===Assassination as military doctrine===

While assassination for military purposes has long been espoused — [[Sun Tzu]] argued for such in ''[[The Art of War]]'', as did [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] in his ''[[The Prince]]'' — In medieval times, an army and even a nation might be based upon and around a particularly strong, canny or charismatic leader, whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war. However, in modern warfare a soldier's mindset is generally considered to surround ideals far more than specific leaders. Theoretically, while the death of a soldier's leader definitely has a detrimental effect on morale, the cause for which they fight is at times strong enough to push through the loss of leadership.

It can be argued that, assassinating a military leader may run the risk of eliminating a later advocate of peace. As many would argue that military leaders, seeing the face of warfare and bearing a clearer sense of the war effort's effects, have more sagacity on the subject. There is the risk that the target may be an incompetent and could be replaced by a more competent leader. Not only that, but worse, there is a high chance such a killing will be treated as not only reinforcing evidence of the opponents' moral bankruptcy, but also &quot;[[martyr]]&quot; the leader, increasing their charisma posthumously and rallying still others to an enemy cause and hardening the enemies' resolve to fight — and resist entreaties to peace (indeed, the death in battle of [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] of [[Sweden]], while not an assassination, led directly to the [[Catholic]] defeat at [[Battle of Luetzen (1632)|Lützen]] as the infuriated Swedes rallied behind their fallen leader). Such an effect can be extremely detrimental to a group or state, but supporters might argue in return that when faced with a particularly brilliant leader, there is no choice but to take the chance and, essentially, hope for a more mediocre successor (one might use the example of the many attempts to kill the Athenian [[Alcibiades]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]], the American shooting down of [[Admiral]] [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] during World War II, or arguably Henri IV of France). Also, they might note that in a time-sensitive situation, such a killing could be useful if only to briefly buy time for a more permanent and effective plan to be set into motion or stall an army as reinforcements rush to the area. Another situation where assassination '''may''' have been beneficial, would have been the early assassination of [[Osama Bin Laden]], which might have saved thousands of lives from the terrorist attacks that occurred on [[September 11, 2001]].

There are a number of examples from [[World War II]], the last [[total war]], which show how assassination can be used as an effective military tool both at a tactical and strategic level. The American's perception that [[Otto Skorzeny|Skorzeny]]'s [[commando]]s were trying to assassinate [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] shows that  military assassination, or the threat of it, if well timed can be a very effective tactical move. In an interview with the ''New York Times'' Skorzeny denied that he had ever intended to [[Operation Grief|assassinate Eisenhower]] and could prove it. ''(page 155, Commando Extraordinary, by Charles Foley)''. There is also a mention in the same book ''(Page 35)'' of a British commando raid to &quot;capture&quot; [[Rommel]]. If he had been removed from the board, then that might well have had strategic effects. The British, too, decided not to try to assassinate Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]], head of the [[Abwehr]] (''German military intelligence''), because to do so might have improved the service.

==Moral issues==
[[Moral equivalence]] is also important when examining the use of assassination. Opponents of what one American officer called &quot;trial, judgment and execution by intelligence&quot; argue that no state deliberately training, hiring, sanctioning or harbouring an assassin could hope to justify it in such a way that would satisfy its allies and neighbours, much less the affected countries (even though many might use the tactic themselves). In [[democracy|democracies]] this issue is particularly crucial; much of the impetus for engaging in military action in such states is the motivation of perceived righteousness fighting a brutal enemy, an opinion that is undermined if one's nation is actively and openly engaged in killings outside the laws of war. Many would argue that the negative morale effects alone would outweigh any possible benefits. Therefore a severe injustice is done if a self-proclaimed democracy calls another authority names and mount assassination plots. Furthermore, opponents of assassination underline that it is essentially the [[death penalty]] stripped of the normal judicial safeguards that limit its use. Second, opponents of assassination question its effectiveness. Most conventional military and political organizations are robust so that the death of the leader would not cause them to collapse. Furthermore, using assassination against a terrorist or guerrilla organization may result in the complete elimination of the known leaders of that organization, but create a set of unknown leaders who cannot then be located.  Finally, assassination makes a negotiation of surrender impossible. Near the end of World War II, for example, Allied forces made specific efforts not to target the political and military leadership of the [[Axis Powers]] specifically so that there would be someone to authorize a surrender.

Supporters of assassination as a policy reply, however, that often the killing of one problematic figure can spare countless lives and years — or even decades — of warfare. An example often cited is the question of what might have come to pass had Adolf [[Hitler]] been assassinated in 1935. Countless millions, the argument goes, would have been spared had only such intervention been taken. However, it could be argued that Adolf Hitler was just one man in a Nazi Party of hundreds, and his successor may be just as brutal (not to mention vengeful). Furthermore, it can be argued that this logic would not only justify killing Hitler in 1935 but also killing Adolf in his crib as an innocent infant. 

However, the widespread attention paid to deeds by those branded as &quot;[[dictators]]&quot; such as [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Idi Amin]] is seen by many as another persuasive argument towards the necessity of eliminating such individuals. The increasing spectre of [[terrorism]], too, often leads many to question why, if it is &quot;kill or be killed&quot;, there should be any delay in taking such action (an opponent would likely be quick to reply, however, that such an action alone leads to the loss of moral equivalence, proving their above argument, although a likely counter could be that moral equivalence is of little use to either a terrorist or one of their dead victims).

Others point out that this point of view may create an unwanted [[slippery slope]], since there may be no difference in principle between assassination intended to save millions of lives, and assassination in order to accomplish an insignificant political goal. For a possible example of the latter sort, see [[Pat Robertson]]'s comments concerning his advocacy of the assassination of [[Venezuela]]n president [[Hugo Chávez]].

==Techniques==
It is entirely likely that the first strategy used by a political or religious killer was a remarkably simple one: find the leader and [[stabbing|stab]] or [[bludgeon]] them to death with whatever weapons were available. This would likely have occurred only in close-knit groups where security was not thought needed, such as amongst nomadic or early sedentary peoples in [[Mesopotamia]] where disagreements would be solved with [[vigilante|vigilantism]] (however it is important to note that information from this far back is very sketchy and debatable in nature). As [[civilization]] took root, however, any leaders in groups began to have more and more a position of importance, and they would become more detached from the groups they ruled. For the first time, [[subterfuge]] would become a major factor in engaging in assassination.

From ancient times, then, through to the medieval period, as the rate of technology was slow so, too, would be the changes in assassins' tactics.  [[Infiltration]] was now the name of the game, and commonly a would-be killer would attempt to gain access to an official or person's guard or staff and utilize a variety of methods for exterminating them, be it the same close-contact stabbing or [[asphyxia|smothering]] or a more advanced method, such as using [[poison]] to induce death. This, however, must be distinguished from efforts by a person or group to remove a person in order to replace them in the [[power structure]]; for more on this, see [[coup d'état]].

With the advent of [[gunpowder]] and far more effective [[ranged weaponry]], however, bodyguards were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question; it could be done from a great distance in a crowded square or even at a church, as with the [[Pazzi Conspiracy]], for example. Often, [[musket]]s or [[rifle]]s might be used to take down a leader from a rooftop, at greater distance, dramatically increasing the chances for survival of an assassin. Also, [[explosives]] became increasingly en vogue for deeds requiring a larger touch; for an example of this, see the article on the [[Gunpowder Plot]] to blow up [[Parliament]] on the [[State Opening of Parliament|state opening]].

In whatever case, it is interesting to note that just because more modern methods of killing became available does not mean older ones were replaced; indeed, in nations like [[India]] killings by knife or [[sword]] remain quite popular, as they do in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] (for example, with the [[machete]]). In fact, since the development of gunpowder each region of the world seems to have its preferred methods of contract murder; besides those mentioned, explosives are quite popular in not only the Middle East but in most of Europe as well, save [[Northern Europe]] where shootings become more common, whereas in the Americas assassinations are almost exclusively performed by gunshot. One can make various cases for any of these, including range, detectability, concealability, likelihood of kill, etc.

As the Renaissance gave way to the [[Industrial Revolution]], assassination became more and more sophisticated, right up to today.  Explosives, especially the [[car bomb]], became far more common, and [[grenade]]s and [[land mine|landmines]] were not unheard of either, especially in the [[Middle East]] and Balkans (the initial attempt on Archduke Franz Ferdinand's life was with a grenade; he was on his way to visit an aide injured in the first attack when his driver stopped to ask directions and he and his wife were shot). Also, [[Rocket propelled grenade]]s (RPGs) became an especially useful tool, given the popularity of armored cars discussed below. Today, any manner of different techniques for the elimination of an enemy - popular or not - might be utilized; the sky, as it were, is the limit. One remarkable recent example involved a political figure who made the mistake of keeping to a regular route and schedule.  Assassins were able to plan for his travel, and detonated an explosive charge &lt;em&gt;beside&lt;/em&gt; the roadway, which propelled a metal plate through the target's vehicle at lethal speed, killing him.

One option glamorized in the media is using a [[sniper rifle]], such as the [[L96]]. The problem with this method is that using a sniper rifle generally attracts the attention of [[police]] and [[government]] authorities, which every smart bounty-hunter wishes to avoid.  A far more useful tool is the [[handgun]].  Deployed correctly and left at the scene of the incident, the completion of the contract can even be portrayed as a [[suicide]].

==Counter-measures==
It would not be a large stretch to say that, in addition to [[terrorism]], political assassination is one of the biggest threats to any modern [[state]] and its [[government]]. As such, the measures to which a leader goes to avoid professional killers ranges from what an average person would consider to be farcical to the paranoid to the downright bizarre. Many would argue, though, that such measures are a lot more effective than they first appear, and that in the world of a new threat seemingly each week, no security is too much.

One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins is without doubt the [[bodyguard]]. Essentially, the bodyguard functions as a counter-assassin, attempting to neutralize the killer before they can make contact with or inflict harm upon the &quot;principal&quot;, or protected/targeted official. This function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, to the point where a direct assassination had to be replaced with carefully-planned [[subterfuge]], such as poison (which was answered by the [[food taster]] such as the [[Beefeater]]s protecting the [[England|English]] monarchs), and even then such methods were often thwarted. Notable examples of bodyguards would include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|janissaries]] — although, in both cases, it should be noted that the protectors often became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage at their whim or eliminating threatening leaders altogether.  Indeed, assassinations both then and today are most often effective when they have the support, tacit or open, of other powerful figures. This is less a concern in the West, where organizations such as the British [[Special Branch]] and American [[Secret Service]] are noted as well-trained and apolitical protective forces. Disloyal protectors continue to be a problem in developing nations, however; [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]] met such an end in 1984.

The race was on with the Middle Ages between leaders and assassins as gunpowder became predominant, each in turn trying to develop stronger and better checks against the increasing abilities of the other. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a [[brigade|small army]] trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down. Heads of state began to cease taking their armies onto the field personally around this time as well, although this was likely as much due to the increasing skills required for generalship and division of power within the government as it was for safety concerns.

As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence of assassins and their capabilities skyrocketed, and so did measures to protect against them. For the first time, [[armored car]]s or [[armored limousine]]s were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions rendering them virtually invulnerable to [[small arms]] fire. [[Bulletproof vest]]s were also commissioned, though not often used for political reasons. Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restrictive; potential visitors would be forced through dozens of different checks and double-checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as [[communication]] became better and [[information technology]] more prevalent, it has become next-to-impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of [[metal detector|metal]] and [[bomb detector]]s. As such most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during [[transport]], both due to weaker security and security lapses, such as with US [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] or as part of [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Patrice Lumumba]] and possibly also [[Salvador Allende]].

Some of the wilder and arguably stranger methods used for protection by famous people of both today and yesterday have evoked many reactions from different people, some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures, some comforted by the security and some lamenting the state of society that such measures are necessary. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[Popemobile]] of [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] (built following an extremist's attempt at his life). [[Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia|Frederick William I of Prussia]] had an entire command of soldiers above two [[meters]] of height, and would reportedly go to great lengths to obtain more. Many leaders, such as [[Josef Stalin]] or the Argentinean [[junta]] were so possessed by paranoia that they executed their opponents ''en masse'', with the death toll ranging from hundreds to millions. Still others go into seclusion, rarely heard from or seen in public afterwards, such as [[writer]] [[Salman Rushdie]] or eccentric [[inventor]] [[Howard Hughes]], though it is more likely that Hughes was concerned about [[germ]]s than about assassination. A more exotic form of protection is the use of a body double. A body double in this case is a person who is built similar to the person he is expected to protect and made up to look like him. The body double then takes the place of the person in high risk situations. Fidel Castro, Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein are known to have used [[political decoy|body doubles]].

It is important to note that, in the final analysis, it is thought by many that if a person or group is committed beyond [[reason]] or concerns for [[welfare|self-preservation]] towards the removal of a certain person or leader from not only their position but this plane of existence, then the chances are better than fair that any security measures taken will come to naught. The [[ninja]] of Japan and [[suicide bombers|suicide attackers]] are both groups known for pursuing every avenue for however long necessary to accomplish their 'hit'. Often, such people or groups would [[suicide|operate without concern for their own life]] in order to gain the slightest chance of eliminating their mark. Certain leaders, notably [[Abraham Lincoln]], were thought to have wrestled with this supposed inevitability during difficult times (with some, like Lincoln's, proving prophetic). In the end it comes down to will - if the will of the would-be assassins to execute their target surpasses that of their security to save them, or the will of the targeted person to survive, then success for a killer may be a matter of time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alcoholism''' (rel. [[drug abuse]]) is a chemical [[addiction]] to either or both the ''consumption of'' or the ''[[inebriation|inebriating]] effects of'' [[alcohol]].
 

== Terminology ==

There are many terms, such as use, [[misuse]], [[heavy use]], [[addiction]], [[abuse]] [[dependence]], all of which have different and sometimes non-standard meanings. 'Use' refers to simple use of a substance. 

An individual who drinks a beer once a day uses alcohol. Misuse and 'heavy use' do not have standard definitions in the field. 

Addiction has two meanings: 
*development of tolerance to the use of a substance (needs more of the substance to achieve the same effect). Withdrawal effects upon discontinuing use. 

*The second definition of addiction is a chemical [[addiction]] to either or both the ''consumption of'' or the ''[[inebriation|inebriating]] effects of'' [[alcohol]]. 

The first definition refers to physiologic dependence, something which for certain drugs can be created in anyone taking the drug. The second refers to the &quot;disease&quot; state of interest to readers of this section, and which cannot be created in an individual simply through use of the drug. 

Psychiatrists and some others refer to the second definition of addiction as dependence. This is where frequent confusion arises since physiologic dependence does not imply the existence of the disease state which psychiatrists call dependence. For example, a test subject might be given alcohol in increasing amounts each day to the extent that the individual would have severe withdrawal if the alcohol were suddenly stopped; in this case, physiologic dependence has formed, but no disease is present. Similarly, an alcoholic in recovery is not drinking at all yet still has the condition just as a diabetic who keeps his blood glucose at precisely 100 (normal) all the time is still diabetic. 

Neither individual would be likely to suffer significant symptoms secondary to their ongoing illness, yet both are still afflicted.

==Diagnosis==
There have been many efforts at diagnostic approaches to alcoholism. 

In a 1992 [[JAMA]] article, the [[Joint Committee of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence]] and the [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] published this definition for alcoholism: &quot;Alcoholism is a primary chronic disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. The disease is often progressive and fatal. It is characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with 
the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking, mostly denial. Each of these symptoms may be continuous or periodic.&quot;

The [[DSM IV]] diagnosis of alcohol dependence represents another approach to the definition of alcoholism, one more closely based on specifics than the 1992 JAMA article. In part this is to assist in the development of research protocols in which findings can be compared with one another, but the DSM definition is the one in general use from a diagnostic standpoint. That definition is: Maladaptive alcohol use with clinically significant impairment as manifested by at least three of the following within any one-year period: Tolerance; Withdrawal; Taken in greater amounts or over longer time course than intended; Desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control use; Great deal of time spent obtaining, using, or recovering from use; Social, occupational, or recreational activities given up or reduced; Continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological sequelae.

Note that many [[sedative]] agents are cross-tolerant with alcohol (meaning that these agents can be taken instead of alcohol to relieve withdrawal symptoms or to maintain the level of sedation provided by alcohol). A more general diagnosis than alcohol dependence is that of sedative dependence. Whether an individual uses alcohol or another sedative, if they meet the criteria above, the process is likely the same.

==Biological mechanism==
The biological mechanism of alcoholism is unknown, although the biologic mechanism of alcohol metabolism and alcohol-induced behavioral change is well-described in the literature. Alcohol itself is not a factor in the development of this condition, however, or one would be able to turn a non-alcoholic into an alcoholic through the provision of alcohol (the literature has demonstrated that this is impossible).

==As a &quot;disease&quot;==
The American Society of Addiction Medicine and the American Medical Association both maintain extensive policy regarding alcoholism. The [[American Psychiatric Association]] recognizes the existence of &quot;alcoholism&quot; as the equivalent of alcohol dependence.  With the publication of the DSM-III in 1980, two separate syndromes of ''alcohol dependence'' and ''alcohol abuse'' replaced the earlier category of alcoholism.  The World Health Organization dropped the diagnostic category &quot;alcoholism&quot; in 1979, replacing it with the diagnostic categories &quot;alcohol dependence&quot; and &quot;harmful use&quot; (ICD-9, 
ICD-10)[http://alcoholism.about.com/cs/alerts/l/blnaa30.htm]. The [[American Hospital Association]], the [http://www.apha.org American Public Health Association], the [[National Association of Social Workers]], and the [[American College of Physicians]] classify &quot;alcoholism&quot; as a [[disease]].

[[Image:Stop_drinking.jpg|thumb|250px|Polish propaganda poster saying: &quot;Stop drinking! Come with us and build a happy tomorrow.&quot;]] The causes for alcohol abuse and dependence cannot be easily explained. However, the belief that the roots are from moral or ethical weakness on the part of the sufferer has been largely altered. A 1995 [[Gallup Poll]] found that 90% of Americans currently believe that &quot;alcoholism&quot; is a [[disease]].{{fact}}

In contrast, in a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision on whether alcoholism is a condition for which the U.S. Veterans Administration should provide benefits, Justice Byron R. White agrees with the U.S. District Court that there exists &quot;a substantial body of medical literature that even contests the proposition that alcoholism is a disease, much less that it is a disease for which the victim bears no responsibility.&quot; [4][5]

Whether or not alcoholism is a disease remains a controversial subject, and not all participants in the debate are without self-interest. For example, if alcoholism is not considered a disease, third-party payments to physicians and hospitals for its treatment might cease.

==Effects==

{{seealso2|Effects of alcohol on the body|Alcohol consumption and health}}
The use of alcohol in alcoholic conditions may have impact upon physical, occupational, marital, educational, and other areas of function. The condition can be lifelong but can be sometimes treated through ongoing therapy accompanied by attendance at self-help meetings. 


== Social impact ==

Today, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are major [[public health]] problems in [[North America]], costing the region's inhabitants, by some estimates, as much as [[US dollar|US$]]170 [[billion]] annually. Alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are life-threatening problems that sometimes end in death, particularly through [[liver]], [[pancreas|pancreatic]], or [[kidney]] disease, internal bleeding, [[brain]] deterioration, [[alcohol poisoning]], and [[suicide]].  Heavy alcohol consumption by a pregnant mother can also lead to [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], an incurable and damaging condition.

Additionally, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are major contributing factors for [[head injury|head injuries]], [[motor vehicle accident]]s (MVA), violence and assaults, [[neurology|neurological]], and other [[medicine|medical]] problems ([[cirrhosis]], etc.).

Of the one half of the North American population who consume alcohol, it has been estimated by some that 10% are alcohol abusers and alcohol dependents, and 6% consume more than half of all alcohol.

[[Stereotype]]s of alcohol abusers and alcohol dependents are often found in [[fiction]] and [[popular culture]]: for example the &quot;[[town drunk]],&quot; or the [[stereotype]] of [[Russians]] and the [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]] as alcoholics. In modern times, the recovery movement has led to more realistic portraits of abusers and dependents and their problems, such as in [[Charles R. Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lost Weekend]]'', or the films ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (movie)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'', and ''[[My Name is Bill W]]'' or the extreme &quot;[[Leaving Las Vegas]]&quot;. [[Charles Bukowski]] describes honestly his alcohol addiction in the movie ''[[Barfly]]'' and in his other writings.
Alcohol dependence can be harder to break and significantly more damaging than dependence on most other addictive substances. The physical symptoms when withdrawing from alcohol can be quite severe and dangerous, with death reported in extreme cases.

The alcoholic personality can exhibit a radical change when they drink, from passive when sober to aggressive when drunk, though the reverse can also be true. 

An alcoholic does not have to be someone who is drunk every night, and a functional alcoholic can have largely normal work and family relationships. However, alcohol represents a major or the major focus of their lives.

===Long-term===
The long-term effects of high quantity alcohol use can include: 
* [[pancreatitis]], or inflammation of the [[pancreas]] (but the [[acute pancreatitis|acute]] and [[chronic pancreatitis|chronic]] form)
* [[heart disease]], including [[dilated cardiomyopathy]]
* [[polyneuropathy]], or damage to the [[nerves]] leading to poor sensation or pain
* [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]], a chronic disease characterized by destruction of liver cells and loss of liver function, and its numerous complications, including bleeding from [[esophageal varices]]
* [[clinical depression|depression]], [[insomnia]], [[anxiety]], and [[suicide]]
* [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure)
* increased incidence of many types of [[cancer]], including [[breast cancer]], [[head and neck cancer]], [[esophageal cancer]] and [[colorectal cancer]]
* [[nutritional deficiency]] of [[folic acid]], [[thiamine]] (vitamin B1) and several others
* [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome]], a neuropsychiatric disorder caused by thiamine deficiency that results from poor nutrition in alcoholics
*[[personality]] changes toward others, especially those who are close
* significant damage to occupational, social, and interpersonal areas, including [[sexual dysfunction]]
*[[gait ataxia]] due to damage to the [[superior vermis]]

==Screening==
Several tools may be used to detect the habitual abuse of alcohol. The CAGE questionnaire, developed by Dr. John Ewing and named for its four questions, is one such example that may be used to screen patients quickly in a doctor's office.

Two &quot;yes&quot; responses indicate that the respondent should be investigated further.

The questionnaire asks the following questions:
# Have you ever felt you needed to '''C'''ut down on your drinking?
# Have people '''A'''nnoyed you by criticising your drinking?
# Have you ever felt '''G'''uilty about drinking?
# Have you ever felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning ('''E'''ye-opener) to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover?

Another screening questionnaire is the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), developed by the World Health Organization.

The Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire [http://eib.emcdda.eu.int/index.cfm?fuseaction=public.Content&amp;nNodeID=3556&amp;sLanguageISO=EN] is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE test. The Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire serves to distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of alcohol abuse.

==Blood tests==
Although there is no [[blood test]] specific for alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence (alcoholism), prolonged heavy alcohol consumption may lead to several abnormalities, including:
*[[Macrocytosis]] (enlarged [[Mean corpuscular volume|MCV]])&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
*Elevated [[Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase|GGT]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
*Moderate elevation of [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]] and [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] and an AST:ALT ratio of 2:1.
*High [[carbohydrate-deficient transferrin]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

==Treatments==

=== Medications ===
 
Although medications have been developed to assist in the treatment of alcoholism, the research has not yet demonstrated long term efficacy for any specific methods of treatment. Alcoholics do not typically experience craving, unlike individuals afflicted with opioid dependence. Of importance is that frequency and quantity of alcohol use are not related to alcoholism; that is, individuals can drink a great deal without necessarily being alcoholic, and alcoholics may drink minimally and/or infrequently. As described in Psychiatric Annals by Pagano et al (June 2005), &quot;alcoholism is a chronic, often progressive disease that can be fatal without intervention and treatment. 

=== Rationing ===

Rationing or other attempts to control use are inceasingly ineffective as [[pathological]] attachment to the drug develops. Use may continues despite serious adverse health, personal, work-related, and financial consequences. [[Comorbidity]], genetic, and psychosocial factors contribute to the risk of developing this disease.&quot; The lifetime prevalence of this condition was estimated in the mid-1990s at approximately 15% (DSM-IV-TR).

=== Detoxification ===

Treatments for alcohol dependence include [[detoxification]] programs run by medical institutions.  These may involve stays for a number of weeks
in specialized [[hospital]] wards where drugs  may be used to avoid [[withdrawal]] symptoms, which in severe cases may lead to [[death]].

=== Therapy ===

After detoxification, various forms of [[group therapy]] or [[psychotherapy]] can be used to deal with underlying psychological issues leading to alcohol dependence. Aversion therapies may be supported by drugs like [[Disulfiram]], which causes a strong and prompt [[hangover]] whenever alcohol is consumed. [[Naltrexone]] may improve compliance with abstinence planning. The standard pharmocopoeia of [[antidepressants]], anxiolytics, and other [[psychotropic]] drugs treat underlying [[mood disorder]]s, [[neurosis|neuroses]], and [[psychosis|psychoses]] associated with alcoholic symptoms.

In the mid-1930s, the mutual-help group-counselling approach to treatment began and has become very popular. [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] is possibly the best-known example of this movement. Other groups include [[LifeRing Secular Recovery]] and [[SMART Recovery]].

=== Prevention ===

Some programs attempt to help problem drinkers before they become dependents. These programs focus on harm-reduction and reducing alcohol intake as opposed to cold-turkey approaches.  One such program is called [[Moderation Management]].

=== Nutritional therapy ===

Another treatment program is based on nutritional therapy. Many alcohol dependents have [[insulin]] resistance syndrome, a metabolic disorder where the body's difficulty in processing [[sugar]]s causes an unsteady supply to the blood stream. While the disorder can be treated by a [[hypoglycemic]] diet, this can affect behaviour and emotions, side-effects often seen among alcohol dependents in treatment. The metabolic aspects of such dependence are often overlooked, resulting in poor treatment outcomes. See: [http://www.hypoglycemia.asn.au]

=== Return to normal drinking ===

Although it has long been argued that alcoholic dependents cannot learn to drink in moderation, research by the U.S. national Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) indicates that about 18% of such individuals in the US whose dependence began more than one year earlier are now drinking in moderation.

==Social impact==
[[Image:Daddydontdrink.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|A Soviet poster reading &quot;Daddy, don't drink&quot;, referring to the massive alcohol abuse  problem in Russia]]The social problems arising from alcohol abuse can include loss of employment, financial problems, marital conflict and divorce, convictions for crimes such as drunk driving or public disorder, loss of accommodation, and loss of respect from others who may see the problem as self-inflicted and easily avoided.  Alcohol dependence affects not only the addicted but can profoundly impact the family members around them.  Children of alcohol dependents can be affected even after they are grown; the behaviors commonly exhibited by such children are collectively known as [[Adult Children of Alcoholics Syndrome]]. [[Al-Anon/Alateen]], a group modelled after Alcoholics Anonymous, offers aid to friends and family members of alcohol dependents.

Many people incorrectly assume that once an alcohol dependent stops drinking, all is well.  However, many people, especially members of Alcoholics Anonymous who have stopped drinking still refer to themselves as &quot;alcoholics&quot; or &quot;recovering alcoholics.&quot;

==Social versus physical dependence==
Symptoms of a person's dependence on alcohol may include, but are not limited to, a feeling of necessity in regard to consumption of alcohol, or an inability to resist alcohol if offered. Though these symptoms often arise from a physical dependence on the substance, it is not uncommon for individuals, especially teenagers and adolescents between the ages of fifteen and twenty, to rely on alcohol as a means of social interaction. If a person cannot refuse alcohol in the presence of others, insists on drinking alcohol excessively for fear of alienation and neglect, or feels they cannot socially interact with others unless under the influence then this person is considered socially dependent on the substance.

These traits can be noticed in individuals with no history of alcohol consumption. Moving, for example as  a student newly attending university, can lead to drinking in order to associate with others. Social dependence, though not physically threatening in early stages, can lead to physical dependence if the person cannot control their urges. &quot;Urges&quot; may be for sense of euphoria, brought on in those with a low tolerance to alcohol by about 2-3 standard drinks in a short period of time. Over time, the amount of alcohol needed to achieve the same affect increases as tolerance increases.

A persons &quot;social dependence&quot; is defined by the Prevention Research Institute from Kentucky (www.askpri.com) as a condition that a person experiences and re-experiences in a social setting. It reflects the habitual experiences one has as they enjoy &quot;partying&quot; with the same people.

==Politics and public health==
Because alcohol abuse affects society as a whole, governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies in order to reduce the harm of alcoholism. The World Health Organization, the European Union and other regional bodies are working on alcohol action plans and programs.

Organisations working with alcohol abusers include:

* [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA)
* [[IOGT International]] (IOGT)
* [[LifeRing Secular Recovery]] (LifeRing)
* [[Men For Sobriety]] (MFS)
* [[Moderation Management]] (MM)
* [[Rational Recovery]] (RR)
* [[Secular Organizations for Sobriety]] (SOS)
* [[SMART Recovery | Self-Management and Recovery Training]] (SMART)
* [[Women For Sobriety]] (WFS)

==Alcohol withdrawal==
There are several distinct but not mutually exclusive clinical [[alcohol withdrawal syndrome]]s caused by alcohol withdrawal:
* Tremulousness - &quot;the shakes&quot;
* Activation syndrome - characterized by tremulousness, agitation, rapid heart beat and [[high blood pressure]].
* [[Seizures]] - acute [[grand mal seizure]]s can occur in alcohol withdrawal in patients who have no history of seizure or any structural brain disease.
* [[Hallucinations]] - usually visual or tactile in alcoholics
* ''[[Delirium tremens]]'' - can be severe and often fatal.

Unlike withdrawal from [[opioid|opioids]] such as [[heroin]], which can be unpleasant but never fatal, alcohol withdrawal can kill (by uncontrolled convulsions or delirium tremens) if it is not properly managed. The pharmacological management of alcohol withdrawal is based on the fact that alcohol, [[barbiturates]], and [[benzodiazepine|benzodiazepines]] have remarkably similar effects on the brain and can be substituted for each other. Since benzodiazepines are the safest of the three classes of drugs, alcohol consumption is terminated and a long-acting benzodiazepine is substituted to block the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The benzodiazepine dosage is then tapered slowly over a period of days or weeks.

__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;
--&gt;
An '''abstraction''' is an idea, conceptualization, or word for the collection of qualities that identify the [[#Referents|referent]] of a word used to describe [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] or [[phenomenon|phenomena]]. For example, the abstraction ''applehood'' could be the collection of qualities that might characterize the referent of the word &quot;apple&quot; in the phrase &quot;the apple on the table&quot;.

==Thought process==
In [[philosophy|philosophical terminology]], ''abstraction'' is the [[Thinking|thought process]] wherein [[idea]]s are distanced from [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s. 

Abstraction uses a [[strategy]] of simplification, wherein formerly concrete details are left ambiguous, vague, or undefined; thus effective [[communication]] about things in the abstract requires an [[intuitive]] or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient.

[[Image:JerryFelix.JPG|right|thumb|100px|Cat on Mat ''(picture 1)'']] 
For example, many different things can be [[red]]. Likewise, many things sit on surfaces (as in ''picture 1'', to the right).  The property of ''[[red]]ness'' and the [[relation]] ''[[Sitting|sitting-on]]'' are therefore abstractions of those objects. Specifically, the conceptual diagram ''graph 1'' identifies only three boxes, two ellipses, and four arrows (and their nine labels), whereas the ''picture 1'' shows much more pictorial detail, with the scores of implied relationships as implicit in the picture rather than with the nine explicit details in the graph.

''Graph 1'' details some explicit relationships between the objects of the diagram. For example the arrow between the ''agent'' and ''CAT:Elsie'' depicts an example of an ''[[is-a]]'' relationship, as does the arrow between the ''location'' and the ''MAT''. The arrows between the [[gerund]] ''SITTING'' and the [[noun]]s ''agent'' and ''location'' express the [[diagram]]'s basic relationship; ''&quot;agent is SITTING on location&quot;''; ''Elsie'' is an instance of ''CAT''.

[[Image:Cat-on-mat.GIF|thumb|250px|[[Conceptual graph]] for A Cat sitting on the Mat ''(graph 1)'']]
Although the description ''sitting-on'' (graph 1) is more abstract than the graphic image of a cat sitting on a mat (picture 1), the delineation of abstract things from concrete things is somewhat ambiguous; this ambiguity or vagueness is characteristic of abstraction. Thus something as simple as a newspaper might be specified to six levels, as in [[Douglas R. Hofstadter]]'s illustration of that ambiguity, with a progression from abstract to concrete in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (1979):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) a publication
:(2) a newspaper
::(3) ''The San Francisco Chronicle''
:::(4) the May 18 edition of the ''Chronicle''
::::(5) my copy of the May 18 edition of the ''Chronicle''
:::::(6) my copy of the May 18 edition of the ''Chronicle'' as it was when I first picked it up (as contrasted with my copy as it was a few days later: in my fireplace, burning)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An abstraction can thus encapsulate each of these levels of detail with no loss of generality. But perhaps a detective or philosopher/scientist might seek to learn about some thing, at progressively deeper levels of detail, to solve a crime or a puzzle.

==Referents==
Abstractions sometimes have ambiguous [[referent]]s; for example, &quot;[[happiness]]&quot; (when used as an abstraction) can refer to as many things as there are people and events or [[states of being]] which make them happy. Likewise, &quot;[[architecture]]&quot; refers not only to the design of safe, functional buildings, but also to elements of [[creation]] and [[innovation]] which aim at elegant solutions to [[construction]] problems, to the use of space, and at its best, to the attempt to evoke an [[emotion|emotional response]] in the builders, owners, viewers and users of the building.&lt;!--See discussion pages 3 to 12 in Eugene Raskin, ''Architecturally Speaking, 2nd edition'', a Delta book, Dell (1966), trade paperback, 129 pages --&gt;

===Instantiation===
Things that do not exist at any particular place and time are often considered abstract. By contrast, instances, or members, of such an abstract thing might exist in many different places and times. Those abstract things are then said to be ''multiply instantiated'', in the sense of ''picture 1'', ''picture 2'', etc., shown above.

It is not sufficient, however, to define ''abstract'' ideas as those that can be instantiated and to define ''abstraction'' as the movement in the opposite direction to instantiation. Doing so would make the concepts 'cat' and 'telephone' abstract ideas since despite their varying appearances, a particular cat or a particular telephone is an instance of the concept &quot;cat&quot; or the concept &quot;telephone&quot;. Although the concepts &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;telephone&quot; are ''abstractions'', they are not ''abstract'' in the sense of the objects in ''graph 1'' above. 

&lt;!-- What is the following paragraph trying to clarify? --&gt;
We might look at other graphs, in a progression from ''cat'' to ''mammal'' to ''animal'', and see that ''animal'' is more abstract than ''mammal''; but on the other hand ''mammal'' is a harder idea to express, certainly in relation to ''[[marsupial]]''.

===Physicality===
A physical object (the referrent of a concept or word) is considered ''concrete'' (not abstract) if it is a ''particular individual'' that occupies a particular place and time.

Abstract things are sometimes defined as those things that do not exist in [[reality]] or exist only as sensory experience, like the color [[red]]. That definition, however, suffers from the difficulty of deciding which things are real (i.e. which things exist in reality). For example, it is difficult to agree to whether concepts like ''God'', ''the number three'', and ''goodness'' are real, abstract, or both.

An approach to resolving such difficulty is to use ''[[predicate]]s'' as a general term for whether things are variously real, abstract, concrete, or of a particular property (e.g. ''good''). Questions about the properties of things are then [[propositions]] about predicates, which propositions remain to be evaluated by the investigator. In the ''graph 1'' above, the graphical relationships like the arrows joining boxes and ellipses might denote predicates. Different levels of abstraction might be denoted by a progression of arrows joining boxes or ellipses in multiple rows, where the arrows point from one row to another, in a series of other graphs, say graph 2, etc.

==Abstraction used in philosophy==
Abstraction in [[philosophy]] is the process (or, to some, the alleged process) in [[concept-formation]] of recognizing some set of common features in [[individual]]s, and on that basis forming a concept of that feature. The notion of abstraction is important to understanding some philosophical controversies surrounding [[empiricism]] and the [[problem of universals]]. It has also recently become popular in formal logic under [[predicate abstraction]].

===Ontological status===
The way that physical objects, like rocks and trees, have [[Category of being|being]] differs from the way that properties of abstract concepts or relations have being, for example the way the [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]], [[particular]], [[individual]]s pictured in ''picture 1'' exist differs from the way the concepts illustrated in ''graph 1'' exist. That difference accounts for the [[ontology|ontological]] usefulness of the word &quot;abstract&quot;. The word applies to properties and relations to mark the fact that, if they exist, they do not exist in space or time, but that instances of them can exist, potentially in many different places and times.

Perhaps confusingly, some [[philosophy|philosophies]] refer to ''[[trope]]s'' (instances of properties) as ''[[abstract particular]]s''. E.g., the particular [[red]]ness of a particular [[apple]] is an ''abstract particular''.

===Reification===
[[Reification]], also called ''hypostatization'', might be considered a [[logical fallacy]] whenever an abstract concept, such as &quot;society&quot; or &quot;technology&quot; is treated as if it were a concrete object. Reification occurs [[linguistics|linguistically]] in the [[English language]] and in many other [[language]]s wherein abstract concepts are referred to using the same sorts of [[noun]]s that signify concrete objects.  That aspect of language can blur the distinction between abstract and concrete things: 
:'''1805''': [[Horatio Nelson]] (''[[Battle of Trafalgar]]'') - &quot;[[England expects that every man will do his duty]]&quot;

===Compression===
&lt;!-- Is this section common knowledge or original research? --&gt;
An abstraction can be seen as a process of mapping multiple different pieces of [[constituent]] data to a single piece of abstract data based on similarities in the constituent data, for example many different physical cats map to the abstraction &quot;CAT&quot;.  This conceptual scheme emphasizes the inherent equality of both constituent and abstract data, thus avoiding problems arising from the distinction between &quot;abstract&quot; and &quot;[[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]]&quot;.  In this sense the process of abstraction entails the identification of similarities between objects and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction (which is itself an object). 
:For example, ''picture 1'' above illustrates the concrete relationship &quot;Cat sits on Mat&quot;.
Chains of abstractions can therefore be constructed moving from neural impulses arising from sensory [[perception]] to basic abstractions such as color or [[shape]] to experiential abstractions such as a specific cat to [[semantic]] abstractions such as the &quot;idea&quot; of a CAT to classes of objects such as &quot;mammals&quot; and even categories such as &quot;object&quot; as opposed to &quot;action&quot;. 
:For example, ''graph 1'' above expresses the abstraction &quot;agent sits on location&quot;.

This conceptual scheme entails no specific [[hierarchical]] [[taxonomy]] (such as the one mentioned involving cats and mammals), only a progressive [[compression]] of detail.

==The neurology of abstraction==
Some research into the human [[brain]] suggests that the left and right hemispheres differ in their handling of abstraction. One side handles collections of examples (eg: examples of a tree) whereas the other handles the concept itself.

==Abstraction in Art==
Most typically ''abstraction'' is used in the arts as a [[synonym]] of [[Abstract art]] in general. It can, however, refer to any object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed another work.

Artist Robert Stark wrote,&quot;Ten years after abandoning formal landscape painting to explore the more direct act of freely applying paint to a surface without a representational motive, I have developed a new vocabulary; light and dark, warm and cool, making marks, brush-strokes like heart-rhythms. Every day is a test of each painting's ability to stand on its own. Each painting is subject to being changed, to being reworked or scraped and repainted as long as it remains in the studio. Where I often used to spend weeks on a painting, attempting to 'make a picture,' now my concerns are more about the energy of light, the mass of space, the emotions of shadows.

I want the painting to meet the viewer somewhere in the middle, where the viewer brings his own experiences to bear in understanding and feeling what he is seeing. I want my paintings to achieve the complexity and density of poetry or of a symphony, to build suggestive layers, implicit felt meaning, not merely to be entertaining bit of color to seduce the eye. I want my paintings to be accessible to children as well as adults, and to be so simply and directly painted that it shows the act of painting for the joy and excitement of it.&quot;

'''Amnesty International''' (commonly known as '''Amnesty''' or  '''AI''') is an [[global|international]], [[non-governmental organization]] with the stated purpose of promoting all the [[human rights]] enshrined in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and other international standards. In particular, Amnesty International campaigns to free all [[prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]]; to ensure fair and prompt trials for [[political prisoner]]s; to abolish the [[death penalty]], [[torture]], and other treatment of prisoners it regards as cruel; to end [[political killing]]s and [[forced disappearance]]s; and to oppose all human rights abuses, whether by governments or by other groups.

==History==
Amnesty International was founded in 1961 by a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[lawyer]] named [[Peter Benenson]] and a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] named [[Eric Baker (activist)|Eric Baker]]. Benenson was reading his newspaper and was shocked and angered to come across the story of two [[Portugal|Portuguese]] students sentenced to seven years in prison &amp;ndash; for the crime of raising their glasses in a toast to [[freedom]]. Benenson wrote to [[David Astor]], editor of ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper, who, on [[May 28]], published Benenson's article entitled ''The Forgotten Prisoners'' [http://www.amnesty.fi/history/the_forgotten_prisoners.htm] that asked readers to write letters showing support for the students. The response was so overwhelming that within a year groups of letter writers had formed in more than a dozen countries, writing to defend victims of injustice wherever they might be. 

By mid-1962, Amnesty had groups working or forming in [[West Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Ceylon]], [[Greece]], [[Australia]], the [[United States]], [[New Zealand]] ([[Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand]]), [[Ghana]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[Argentina]], [[Jamaica]], [[Malaya]], [[Congo (Brazzaville)]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Burma]], and [[India]]. Later in that year, a member of one of these groups, Diana Redhouse, designed Amnesty's Candle and Barbed-Wire logo. 

In its early years, Amnesty focused only on articles 18 and 19 of the [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] &amp;ndash; those dealing with political prisoners, or more precisely, [[prisoners of conscience]] who espoused non-violence. 

Amnesty and its writers campaigned for the release of prisoners in many oppressive regimes around the world; all such regimes were pressured equally, no matter which side (if either) of the [[Cold War]] they might align with.  For example, the Spring 1986 newsletter campaigns for the release of specific prisoners from [[Guatemala]], [[South Korea]], [[South Africa]], [[Syria]], the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]], and [[Vietnam]]. 

Amnesty International was in particular a thorn in the side of the [[Soviet Union]]; they published detailed reports both of conditions in Soviet prisons and of how the Soviet political system as a whole was structured to prevent dissent and political freedom. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/07/AR2005060701497.html]
Soviet internal security documents later found in archives indicated concern about Amnesty's anti-Soviet activities. [http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/pdfs/dis70/dis70-e.html]
[[Natan Sharansky]] is one of the more famous Soviet prisoners whose eventual release was secured with the help of Amnesty.

Amnesty was also very active in condemning oppressive regimes which commited murders, disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and outright massacres against their own citizens.  For example, the September/October 1988 newsletter's lead article was an appeal to the [[United Nations Security Council]] to &quot;act immediately to stop the massacre of Kurdish civilians by Iraqi forces&quot; under [[Saddam Hussein]].

In 1977 Amnesty won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for its work defending human rights around the world.

During the 1980s, Amnesty increased its visibility via popular culture events, including [[The Secret Policeman's Balls]] series, the 1986 U.S.-based [[A Conspiracy of Hope Tour]], and the 1988 worldwide [[Human Rights Now! Tour]].

Over time, the organization has expanded its mission to work to prevent and end grave abuses of the rights to physical and mental integrity, freedom of conscience and expression, and freedom from discrimination, within the context of its work to promote all human rights. Amnesty is currently running global campaigns to &quot;Control Arms&quot;, &quot;Stop Violence Against Women&quot; and to end the &quot;Death Penalty&quot;, amongst others. Amnesty also works directly on behalf of individuals suffering human rights abuses. In 2000 alone, AI worked on the cases of 3,685 named individuals &amp;ndash; and in over a third of those cases, an improvement in the prisoner's condition occurred. Today, there are upwards of 7,500 AI groups with almost two million members operating in 162 countries and territories. Since AI was founded, it has worked to defend more than 44,600 prisoners in hundreds of countries.

==Goals and strategy==
AI aims to maintain every human's basic rights as established under the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. In accordance with this belief, Amnesty works to:

* Free all [[Prisoner of conscience|Prisoners of Conscience]] (a &quot;POC&quot; is a person imprisoned for the peaceful exercise of their beliefs, which differs somewhat from the typical use of the term [[political prisoner]]).
* Ensure fair and prompt [[trial (law)|trial]]s.
* Abolish all forms of [[torture]] and ill-treatment of prisoners, including the use of the [[death penalty]].
* End state-sanctioned terrorism, killings, and disappearances.
* Assist political [[asylum-seeker]]s.
* Co-operate with organizations that seek to put an end to human rights abuses.
* Raise awareness about human rights abuses around the world. 

To fulfill these goals, Amnesty sends teams of researchers to investigate claims of human rights abuses. It publicizes its findings and mobilizes its members to [[Lobbying|lobby]] against the abuse &amp;mdash; by letter-writing (to various government officials), protesting, demonstrating, organizing fund-raisers, educating the public about the offence, or sometimes all of the above. 

Amnesty International works to combat individual offences (e.g. one man imprisoned for distributing banned literature in [[Saudi Arabia]]) as well as more general policies (e.g. the recently overturned policy of executing juvenile offenders in [[Capital punishment in the United States|certain U.S. states]]).  Amnesty works primarily on the local level but its forty-year history of action and its Nobel Peace Prize give it international recognition.

Most AI members utilize letter-writing to get their message across. When the central Amnesty International organization finds and validates to its satisfaction instances of human rights abuse, they notify each of more than 7,000 local groups as well as over one million independent members, including 300,000 in the United States alone.  Groups and members then respond by writing letters of protest and concern to a government official closely involved in the case, generally without mentioning Amnesty directly. 

Amnesty International follows a neutrality policy called the &quot;country rule&quot; stating that members should not be active in issues in their own [[nation]], which also protects them from potential mistreatment by their own government.  This principle is also applied to researchers and campaigners working for the [[International Secretariat]] to prevent domestic political loyalties influencing coverage.

Recently, Amnesty has expanded the scope of its work to include economic, social and cultural rights, saying that these concerns had arisen out of its traditional work on political and civil rights. Its 2004 annual report said that &quot;it is difficult to achieve sustainable progress towards implementation of any one human right in isolation. ... AI will strive to ... assert a holistic view of rights protection. It will be particularly important to do so in relation to extreme poverty, and the human rights issues underlying poverty.&quot;[http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/hragenda-6-eng] As an example it asserts that &quot;The right to effective political participation depends on a free media, but also on an educated and literate population.&quot;[http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/hragenda-6-eng]

== Freedom of Expression ==
Amnesty International's postion on freedom of expression is more restrictive than what is legislated in some countries.  The organisation endorses restrictions on hate speech, racial, religious or otherwise.  In reference to the [[Muhammad cartoon controversy]], the organisation stated:

:&quot;However, the right to freedom of expression is not absolute -- neither for the creators of material nor their critics. It carries responsibilities and it may, therefore, be subject to restrictions in the name of safeguarding the rights of others. In particular, any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence cannot be considered legitimate exercise of freedom of expression. Under international standards, such &quot;hate speech&quot; should be prohibited by law.&quot; [http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGPOL300072006?open&amp;of=ENG-315]

==Organization==
''[[Image:Irene Khan 2003.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Irene Khan]], Secretary General since August 2001]]''
Amnesty International is governed by the International Executive Council (IEC) &amp;ndash; a board of eight members elected for two-year terms by the International Council Meeting, which is itself composed of delegates from each country's Board of Directors.  The IEC hires a Secretary General (since 2001, [[Irene Khan]]) and an International Secretariat, located in [[London]].

National and local organizational structures vary.  In the United States, individual members, regardless of age, and each individual organization votes to elect members to the 18-seat national Board of Directors for a three-year term.  The Board of Directors hires an Executive Director and a staff. 

===Secretary Generals===
*[[Peter Benenson]], [[1961]]&amp;ndash;1966 (President)
*[[Eric Baker (activist)|Eric Baker]], [[1966]]&amp;ndash;1968
*[[Martin Ennals]], [[1968]]&amp;ndash;1980
*[[Thomas Hammarberg]], [[1980]]&amp;ndash;1986
*[[Ian Martin]], [[1986]]&amp;ndash;1992
*[[Pierre Sané]], [[1992]]&amp;ndash;2001
*[[Irene Khan]], [[2001]]&amp;ndash;present

===Finances===
Amnesty International is a non-partisan organization financed largely by subscriptions and donations from its worldwide membership, and except for a small core of paid directors, 200 or so full-time researchers in the ''International Secretariat'' in [[London]], and various coordinators and organisers in national ''sections'', most of Amnesty's members and  coordinators of local groups, and many supporters contributing time and energy to the organisation, are volunteers.  It does not accept donations from governments or governmental organizations.  Amnesty's budget for the 2002 fiscal year included:

* Membership Support:  [[Pound Sterling|£]]2,816,800  (12%) 
* Campaigning Activities:   £2,387,100  (10%) 
* Publications and Translation:  £2,810,600  (12%) 
* Research and Action:   £5,828,800  (26%)
* Deconcentrated Offices:  £1,720,400  (7%) 
* Research and Action Support:  £3,481,100  (15%) 
* Administrative Costs:   £3,918,400  (18%) 
* Relief Payments: £48,000 
* Total:  £23,728,000 (including contingency)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], an '''abelian group''', also called a '''commutative group''', is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] (''G'', *) such that 

:''a'' * ''b'' = ''b'' * ''a'' 

for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''G''. In other words, the order of elements in a product doesn't matter. Such groups are generally easier to understand.

Abelian groups are named after [[Niels Henrik Abel]]. Groups that are not commutative are called '''''non-abelian''''' (rather than ''non-commutative'').

== Notation ==

There are two main notational conventions for abelian groups -- additive and multiplicative.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
! Convention
! Operation
! Identity
! Powers
! Inverse
! [[Direct sum|Direct sum/product]]
|-
! Addition
| ''a'' + ''b'' || 0 || ''na'' || &amp;minus;''a'' || ''G'' &amp;oplus; ''H''
|-
! Multiplication
| ''a'' * ''b'' or ''ab'' || ''e'' or 1
| ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
| ''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; || ''G'' &amp;times; ''H''
|}

The multiplicative notation is the usual notation for groups, while the additive notation is the usual notation for [[module (mathematics)|module]]s. When studying abelian groups in their own right, the additive notation is usually used.

== Examples ==

Every [[cyclic group]] ''G'' is abelian, because if ''x'', ''y'' are in ''G'', then ''xy'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m'' + ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''yx''. In particular, the [[integer]]s '''Z''' form an abelian group under addition, as do the [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo ''n'']] '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''.

The [[real number]]s form an abelian group under addition, as do the non-zero real numbers under multiplication.

Every [[Ring theory|ring]] is an abelian group with respect to its addition operator. Also, in every [[commutative ring]] the invertible elements, or [[unit (ring theory)|units]] form an abelian [[multiplicative group]].

Any [[subgroup]] of an abelian group is [[normal subgroup|normal]], so for every subgroup there is a [[quotient group]]. Subgroups, factor groups, and [[direct sum of groups| direct sums]] of abelian groups are again abelian.

== Multiplication table ==

To verify that a certain [[finite group]] is indeed abelian, a table (matrix) can be drawn up in the similar fashion to a [[multiplication table]], where, if the group is ''G'' = {''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''e'', ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} under the operation &amp;sdot;, the (''i'', ''j'')'th entry of this table contains the product ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;sdot; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. The group is abelian  [[if and only if]] this table is symmetric about the main diagonal (i.e. if the matrix is a [[symmetric matrix]]).

This is true since if the group is abelian, then ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;sdot; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;sdot; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. This implies that the (''i'', ''j'')'th entry of the table equals the (''j'', ''i'')'th entry - i.e. the table is symmetric about the main diagonal.

== Properties ==

If ''n'' is a [[natural number]] and ''x'' is an element of an abelian group ''G'' written additively, then ''nx'' can be defined as ''x'' + ''x'' + ... + ''x'' (''n'' summands) and (&amp;minus;''n'')''x'' = &amp;minus;(''nx''). In this way, ''G'' becomes a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] '''Z''' of integers. In fact, the modules over '''Z''' can be identified with the abelian groups.

Theorems about abelian groups (i.e. modules over the [[principal ideal domain]] '''Z''') can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of [[finitely generated abelian group]]s.

If ''f'', ''g'' : ''G'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp; ''H'' are two [[group homomorphism]]s between abelian groups, then their sum ''f'' + ''g'', defined by (''f'' + ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''g''(''x''), is again a homomorphism. (This is not true if ''H'' is a non-abelian group). The set Hom(''G'', ''H'') of all group homomorphisms from ''G'' to ''H'' thus turns into an abelian group in its own right.

Somewhat akin to the [[dimension]] of [[vector space]]s, every abelian group has a ''[[rank of an abelian group|rank]]''. It is defined as the [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of the largest set of [[linearly independent]] elements of the group. The integers and the [[rational number]]s have rank one, as well as every subgroup of the rationals. While the rank one [[torsion-free]] abelian groups are well understood, even finite-rank abelian groups are not well understood. Infinite-rank abelian groups can be extremely complex and many open questions exist, often intimately connected to questions of [[set theory]].

== Finite abelian groups ==

The '''fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups''' states that every finite abelian group can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of [[prime number|prime]]-power order. This is a special application of the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]] in the case when ''G'' has torsion-free rank equal to 0.

'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''mn''&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to the direct product of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''m'' and ''n'' are [[coprime]].

Therefore we can write any finite abelian group ''G'' as a direct product of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{k_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{k_u}&lt;/math&gt;
in two unique ways:
*where the numbers ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''k''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; are powers of primes
*where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; [[divisor|divides]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which divides ''k''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and so on up to ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Thus we have 3 2 or 6, 5 2 or 10, 4 3 or 12, 3 2 2 or 6 2, 7 2 or 14, and 5 3 or 15, but anyway 2 2, 4 2, 2 2 2, 3 3, 8 2, 4 4, 4 2 2, and 2 2 2 2.

For example, '''Z'''/15'''Z''' = '''Z'''/15 can be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 5:  '''Z'''/15 = {0, 5, 10} &amp;oplus; {0, 3, 6, 9, 12}.  The same can be said for any abelian group of order 15, leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order 15 are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]].

For another example, every group of order 8 is isomorphic to either '''Z'''/8 (the integers 0 to 7 under addition modulo 8), '''Z'''/4 &amp;nbsp;&amp;oplus;&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''/2 (the odd integers 1 to 15 under multiplication modulo 16), or '''Z'''/2 &amp;nbsp;&amp;oplus;&amp;nbsp; '''Z'''/2 &amp;nbsp;&amp;oplus;&amp;nbsp; '''Z'''/2.

==List of small abelian groups==
Extracted from the [[list of small groups]] is the following table of small abelian groups.

Note that e.g. &quot;3 &amp;times; Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; means that there are 3 subgroups of type Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while elsewhere the cross means  [[direct product]].

== Relation to other mathematical topics ==

The abelian group, together with group homomorphisms, form a [[category theory|category]], the prototype of an [[abelian category]]. In this encyclopedia, we denote this category '''Ab'''. See [[category of abelian groups]] for a list of its properties.

Many large abelian groups carry a natural [[topological space|topology]], turning them into [[topological group]]s.

== A note on the typography ==
Among mathematical [[adjective]]s derived from the [[proper name]] of a [[mathematician]], the word &quot;abelian&quot; is rare in being expressed with a lowercase '''a''', rather than '''A''' (compare, for example, [[Riemannian geometry|Riemannian]]). Contrary to what one might expect, naming a concept in this way is considered one of the highest honors in mathematics for the [[namesake]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty''' ('''ABM treaty''' or '''ABMT''') was a treaty between the [[United States|United States of America]] and the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] on the limitation of the [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) systems used in defending areas against missile-delivered [[nuclear weapon]]s. On [[May 26]] [[1972]], the [[President of the United States]], [[Richard Nixon]] and the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Leonid Brezhnev]] signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.  The treaty was in force for thirty years, from [[1972]] until [[2002]]. On [[June 13]] [[2002]], six months after giving the required notice of intent, the US withdrew from the treaty.

The full text is available on [[WikiSource:Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty|Wikisource]].

==Early history==
Throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the United States had been developing a series of missile systems with the ability to shoot down incoming [[ICBM]] warheads.  During this period the US maintained a lead in the number and sophistication of their delivery systems, and considered the defense of the US as a part of reducing the overall damage inflicted in a full nuclear exchange.  As part of this defence, [[Canada]] and the US established the North American Air Defense Command (now called [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]]).

By the early 1960s the US research on the [[Nike Zeus]] missile system (see [[Project Nike]]) had developed to the point where small improvements would allow it to be used as the basis of a &quot;real&quot; ABM system. Work started on a short range, high speed counterpart known as the [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] to provide defense for the ABM sites themselves. By the mid-1960s both systems showed enough promise to start development of base selection for a nationwide ABM system, then known as '''Sentinel'''.

At this point an intense debate broke out in public over the merits of such a system. A number of serious concerns about the technical abilities of the system came to light, many of which reached popular magazines such as [[Scientific American]]. At the same time it grew increasingly clear that if the system did work, then the Soviets best course of action was to immediately launch an attack on the US before the system became operational.

As this debate continued, a new development in ICBM technology essentially rendered the points moot. This was the deployment of the [[MIRV]] system, allowing a single ICBM missile to deliver several warheads at a time. With this system the USSR could simply overwhelm the ABM defense system with numbers. Upgrading it to counter the additional warheads would cost more than the handful of missiles needed to overwhelm the new system, as the defenders required one rocket per warhead, whereas the attackers could place perhaps 10 warheads on a rocket that was perhaps the same price as the ABM.

At about the same time, the USSR reached strategic parity with the US in terms of ICBM forces. No longer would a war be a matter of the utter destruction of the USSR with the US able to continue on, now both countries would be devastated. This led to the concept of [[mutually assured destruction]], '''MAD''', in which any changes to the strategic balance had to be carefully weighed. ABMs, now ready for use after over a decade of development, seemed to be far too risky &amp;ndash; it was better to have no defense than one that might trigger a war.

As relations between the US and USSR warmed in the later years of the 1960s, the US first proposed an ABM treaty in 1967. This proposal was rejected. Following the proposal of the Sentinel and Safeguard decisions on American ABM systems, the [[SALT I]] talks began in November [[1969]]. By [[1972]] agreement had been reached to limiting strategic offensive weapons and strategic defensive systems. Each country was allowed one site at which it could base a defensive system, Moscow and [[Grand Forks]], [[North Dakota]].  It was signed in Moscow [[May 26]], [[1972]], and ratified by the Senate [[August 3]], [[1972]]. It was seen by many as a key piece in nuclear arms control, being an implicit recognition of the need to ''protect'' the nuclear balance by ensuring neither side could ever consider itself immune from retaliation.

For many years the ABM Treaty was considered one of the landmarks in arms limitations. It required two enemies to agree not to deploy a potentially useful weapon, deliberately to maintain the [[balance of power]]. In doing so, the formerly terrible relations between the US and USSR started to change considerably.

==After the SDI announcement==
The treaty was undisturbed until [[Ronald Reagan]] announced his [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) on [[March 23]] [[1983]]. Reagan stated that SDI was &quot;consistent with... the ABM Treaty&quot; and he viewed it as a defensive system that would help reduce the possibility of [[mutual assured destruction]] (MAD) becoming reality; he even suggested that the Russians would be given access to the SDI technology.

This extremely ambitious project was a blow to [[Yuri Andropov]]'s tentative 'peace offensive'. Andropov said that &quot;It is time they [Washington] stopped... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible. It is insane&quot;. 

SDI research went ahead, although it did not achieve the hoped for result. SDI research was cut back following the end of Reagan's presidency, and in [[1995]] it was reiterated in a presidential joint statement that &quot;missile defense systems may be deployed... [that] will not pose a realistic threat to the strategic nuclear force of the other side and will not be tested to... [create] that capability.&quot;  This was reaffirmed in [[1997]].

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991 the status of the treaty became unclear, debated by members of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] and professors of law, [http://www.nesl.edu/intljournal/vol9/mccarty.pdf Succession of the ABM Treaty],[http://www.clw.org/pub/clw/coalition/laws050300.htm State Succession and the Legal Status of the ABM Treaty], and [http://missilethreat.com/reports/abm_memorandum.html Miron-Feith Memorandum].  In 1997, a [[memorandum of understanding]] [http://www.defenselink.mil/acq/acic/treaties/abm/ad_mou.htm] between the US and four of the former USSR states was signed and subject to ratification by each signatory, however it was not presented to the US Senate for ratification by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]].

On [[December 13]], [[2001]], President [[George W. Bush]] gave [[Russia]] notice of the United States' withdrawal from the treaty, in accordance with the clause that requires six months' notice before terminating the pact. This was the first time in recent history the United States has withdrawn from a major international arms treaty.

Supporters of the withdrawal argued that it was a necessity in order to test and build a limited [[National Missile Defense]] to protect the United States from [[nuclear blackmail]] by a [[rogue state]]. The withdrawal had many critics as well as supporters. John Rhinelander, a negotiator of the ABM treaty, predicted that the withdrawal would be a &quot;fatal blow&quot; to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and would lead to a &quot;world without effective legal constraints on [[nuclear proliferation]].&quot;

Reaction to the withdrawal by both Russia and the [[People's Republic of China]] was much milder than many had predicted, and followed months of discussion with both Russia and China aimed at convincing both that development of a [[National Missile Defense]] was not directed at them. In the case of Russia, the United States has stated that it intends to discuss a massive bilateral reduction in the numbers of nuclear warheads, which would allow Russia to reduce its spending on missiles. In the case of China, statements by [[Condoleezza Rice]], U.S. [[Secretary of State]], appeared to some observers to suggest that the United States would not object to an expansion of China's nuclear arsenal in a manner that would allow it to overwhelm American anti-ballistic capabilities.

The U.S. withdrawal from the ABM treaty was followed shortly thereafter by the signing of the [[Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] in Moscow on [[24 May]] [[2002]], potentially the largest ever cut in deployed strategic nuclear warheads.

'''Alcoholic beverages''' are [[drink|drinks]] containing [[ethanol]].  Most governments regulate or restrict the sale and use of alcohol.

==Chemistry==
The ethanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) in alcoholic beverages is almost always produced by [[fermentation]], which is the [[metabolism]] of [[carbohydrate]]s (usually [[sugar]]s) by certain species of [[yeast]] in the absence of [[oxygen]]. The process of culturing yeast under conditions that produce alcohol is referred to as [[brewing]].

It should be noted that in [[chemistry]], [[alcohol]] is a general term for any [[organic compound]] in which a [[hydroxyl]] [[Functional group|group]] (''-[[oxygen|O]][[hydrogen|H]]'') is bound to a [[carbon]] atom, which in turn is bound to other [[hydrogen]] and/or carbon atoms.  Other alcohols such as [[propylene glycol]] and the [[sugar alcohol]]s may appear in food or beverages regularly, but these alcohols do not make them ''alcoholic''.

It has been suggested that alcoholic impurities, [[congener]]s, are the cause of [[hangover]]s.

Alcoholic beverages with a concentration of about 50% ethanol or greater (100 proof) are [[flammable]] liquids and easily ignited.

''See also: [[ethanol]]''

==Alcoholic content==
The [[concentration]] of alcohol in an alcoholic beverage may be specified in percent [[alcohol by volume]] (ABV), in percentage by weight (sometimes abbreviated '''w/w''' for ''weight for weight''), or in [[alcoholic proof|proof]]. The 'proof' measurement roughly corresponds in a 2:1 ratio to percent alcoholic content by volume (e.g. 80 proof ≈ 40% ABV). Common [[distillation]] cannot exceed 192 proof because at that point ethanol is an [[azeotrope]] with water. Alcohols of this purity are commonly referred to as [[grain alcohol]] and are not meant for human consumption, with the notable exception of [[neutral grain spirit]]s.

Most yeasts cannot grow when the concentration of alcohol is higher than about 18% by volume, so that is a practical limit for the strength of fermented beverages such as [[wine]], [[beer]], and [[sake]].  Strains of yeast have been developed that can survive in solutions of up to 25% alcohol by volume, but these were bred for ethanol fuel production, not beverage production.  Spirits are produced by [[distillation]] of a fermented product, concentrating the alcohol and eliminating some of the by-products. Many wines are [[fortified wines]] with additional grain alcohol to achieve higher ABV than is easily reached using fermentation alone.

==Flavouring==
Ethanol is a moderately good solvent for many &quot;fatty&quot; substances and essential &quot;oils&quot;, and thus facilitates the inclusion of several coloring, flavouring, and aromatic compounds to alcoholic beverages, especially to distilled ones.  These flavouring ingredients may be naturally present in the starting material, or may be added before fermentation, before distillation, or before bottling the distilled product. Sometimes the flavour is obtained by allowing the beverage to stand for months or years in barrels made of special wood, or in bottles where scented twigs or fruits &amp;mdash; or even insects &amp;mdash; have been inserted.

A well-stocked bar will include a selection of beers and wines, along with the typical spirits of [[vodka]], [[rum]], [[gin]], [[tequila]], and [[whisky]]; each in varying qualities from &quot;well&quot; quality (off brand) to premium quality (name brand) to &quot;top shelf&quot; (usually very expensive, ranging from $50 to several hundred USD per 750 ml bottle). Alcoholic beverages can be combined at the time of serving, sometimes with other ingredients, to create [[cocktail]]s or ''mixed drinks''. Small servings of pure liquor (shots) are also common, with whisky and tequila being traditionally popular selections.

==History==
{{main|History of alcohol}}
Alcoholic beverages have been widely consumed since prehistoric times by people around the world, seeing use as a component of the standard diet, for hygienic or medical reasons, for their relaxant and euphoric effects, for [[recreational drug use|recreational purposes]], for artistic inspiration, as [[aphrodisiac|aphrodisiacs]], and for other reasons. Some have been invested with symbolic or religious significance suggesting the mystical use of alcohol, e.g. by [[Greek religion|Greco-Roman religion]] in the [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] rituals of [[Dionysus]] (also called [[Bacchus]]), god of drink and revelry; in the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Eucharist]]; and at the [[Jew]]ish [[Passover]].

===Fermented beverages===
Chemical   analyses of organics absorbed and preserved in pottery jars from the Neolithic village of [[Jiahu]], in Henan province, Northern China, have revealed that a mixed fermented beverage of rice, honey, and fruit was being produced as early as 9,000 years ago.  This is approximately the same time that barley beer and grape wine were beginning to be made in the Middle East. Recipes have been found on clay tablets and art in [[Mesopotamia]] that show individuals using straws to drink [[beer]] from large vats and pots.

Wine was consumed in [[Classical Greece]] at breakfast or at [[symposium|symposia]], and in the [[1st century BC]] it was part of the diet of most [[Roman Empire|Roman]] citizens. However, both Greeks and Romans generally consumed their wine watered (from 1 parts of wine to 1 part of water, to 1 part of wine to 4 parts of water). The transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast is one of the miracles attributed to [[Jesus]] in the [[New Testament]], and his symbolic use of wine in the [[Last Supper]] led to it becoming an essential part of the [[Catholic]] [[Eucharist]] rite.

The ambiguity of the [[Qur'an]]ic ban on alcoholic beverages, meant that wine (usually sold by Christian tavern-keepers) remained fairly popular in Islamic lands over the centuries, as revealed in the verses of [[Persian people|Persian]] poet and mathematician [[Omar Khayyám]] (1040&amp;ndash;1131):

:&quot;Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,
:A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse&amp;mdash;and Thou
:Beside me singing in the Wilderness&amp;mdash;
:And Wilderness is Paradise enow.&quot; [http://www.armory.com/~thrace/ev/siir/Omar_Khayyam.html]

In [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]], beer was consumed by the whole family, thanks to a triple fermentation process &amp;mdash; the men had the strongest, then women, then children. A document of the times mentions [[nun]]s having an allowance of six pints of ale a day.  [[Cider]] and [[pomace wine]] were also widely available, while grape wine was the prerogative of the higher classes. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, wine production in Europe appears to have been sustained chiefly by monasteries.

By the time the Europeans reached the [[Americas]] in the [[15th century]], several [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] civilizations had developed alcoholic beverages.  According to a post-Conquest [[Aztec]] document, consumption of the local &quot;wine&quot; (''[[pulque]]'') was generally restricted to religious ceremonies, but freely allowed to those over 70 years old (possibly the all-time record for [[legal drinking age]]). The natives of [[South America]] manufactured a beer-like product from [[cassava]] or [[maize]] (''[[cauim]]'', ''[[chicha]]''), which had to be chewed before fermentation in order to turn the [[starch]] into sugars. (Curiously, the same technique was used in ancient [[Japan]] to make ''[[sake]]'' from [[rice]] and other starchy crops.)

The medicinal use of alcoholic beverages was mentioned in Sumerian and Egyptian texts dated from [[2100 BC]] or earlier. The [[Hebrew Bible]] recommends giving alcoholic drinks to those who are dying or depressed, so that they can forget their misery. &lt;!--to be expanded--&gt;

===Distilled beverages===
{{main|Distilled beverages}}

Beer and wine are typically limited to a maximum 15 percent alcohol, although brewers have reached 25% alcohol. Beyond this limit yeast is adversely affected and cannot ferment. Since the fourth millennium BC in Babylonia, higher levels of alcohol have been obtained in a number of ways. It was not until the [[still]] was invented by [[Islam]]ic alchemists in the 8th or 9th centuries that the history of [[distilled beverage]]s began. Distilled alcohol appeared first in Europe in the mid 12th century and by the early [[14th century]] it had spread throughout Europe. It also spread eastward, mainly by the [[Mongol]]s, and was practiced in [[China]] by the 14th century. However, recent archeological evidence has supported the idea that China has had wines and distilled beverages dating back to [[5000 BC]]. [[Paracelsus]] gave alcohol its modern name, taking it from the Arabic word which means &quot;finely divided&quot;, a reference to distillation.

==Uses==
In many countries, alcoholic beverages are commonly consumed at the major daily meals (lunch and dinner).  Most early beers were in fact highly nutritional and served as a means of calorie distribution.  Beer can be stored longer than grain or bread without fear of pest infestation or rotting, and drinking beer avoided the tooth-destroying grit that was present in hand-ground or early mill-ground flours.

In places and eras with poor public sanitation, such as [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Europe]], consumption of alcoholic beverages (particularly weak or &quot;small&quot; [[beer]]) was one method of avoiding water-borne diseases such as the [[cholera]]. Though strong alcohol kills bacteria, the low concentration in beer or even wine will have only a limited effect.  Probably the [[boiling]] of water, which is required for the brewing of beer, and the growth of yeast, which would tend to crowd out other micro-organisms, were more important than the alcohol itself.  In any case, the ethanol (and possibly other ingredients) of alcoholic beverages allows them to be stored for months or years in simple wood or clay containers without spoiling, which was certainly a major factor in their popularity.

A recent study indicated that ethanol has been found to stimulate the virulence of ''[[Acinetobacter|Acinetobacter  baumannii]]''.  Tests on infected [[nematode worm]]s that were dosed with ethanol found that the worms laid fewer eggs and their life spans were only 80% of worms infected with a version of ''A. baumannii'' that didn't respond to ethanol.  This study suggests that the common misconception that drinking alcohol kills infections is false and drinking alcohol may actually help the infection to grow.{{note|abacter}}

In colder climates, strong  alcoholic beverages such as [[vodka]] are popularly seen as a way to &quot;warm up&quot; the body, possibly because ethanol is a quickly absorbed source of [[food energy]] and dilates peripheral blood vessels (Peripherovascular dilation). This however is a dangerous myth, and people experiencing [[hypothermia]] should avoid alcohol. Although a drunk may feel warmer, the body loses heat and body temperature decreases, which may cause hypothermia, and eventually death. This is because of the dilation of blood vessels '''not''' in the core of the body; because of this increased bloodflow, the body loses its heat out of its less protected outer extremities.

In many cultures, both contemporary and historical, alcoholic beverages &amp;mdash; mostly because of their neurological effects &amp;mdash; have also played an important role in various kinds of social interaction, providing a form of &quot;liquid courage&quot; (those who consume it &quot;gain&quot; confidence and lose discretion)    While other psychoactive drugs (such as [[opium]], [[coca]], [[khat]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[kava-kava]], etc.) also have millennial traditions of social use, only [[coffee]], [[tea]] and [[tobacco]] have been as universally used and accepted as ethanol is today.

==Alcohol consumption and health==
{{main|Alcohol consumption and health}}

===Moderate comsumption===

Moderate consumption of alcohol, defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans as no more than two drinks for men and one drink for women per day, is consistently shown as being beneficial for the heart and circulatory system (the [[United Kingdom|UK]] equivalent is 3-4 units per day for men and 2-3 units for women).  Moderate consumers statistically have fewer [[heart attack]]s and [[stroke]]s, live longer, have lower [[blood pressure]], and generally report better overall health. 

===Excess comsumption===

However, some people are prone to developing a [[chemical dependency]] to alcohol, [[alcoholism]]. The results of alcoholism are considered a major health problem in many nations.

Frequent excessive consumption can harmfully interfere with the user's well-being. The neurological effects of alcohol use are often a factor in deadly motor vehicle accidents and fights. People under the influence of alcohol sometimes find themselves in dangerous or compromising situations where they would not be had they remained sober. Operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery under the influence of alcohol is a serious crime in almost all developed nations.

==Legal considerations==
[[Image:AlcoholConsumptionSign.jpg|thumb|right|Alcohol restriction in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].]]
Most countries have rules forbidding the sale of alcoholic beverages to [[child]]ren. For example, in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]], one has to be 16 to buy beer or wine and 18 to buy distilled alcoholic beverages. However, possession of alcoholic beverages is not illegal for minors in Germany. Law there is directed at the potential sellers of alcoholic beverages and not at the minors. German law puts control concerning the consumption of alcoholic beverage into the hands of custodial persons and persons with parental power. See [http://www.bmfsfj.de/RedaktionBMFSFJ/Abteilung5/Pdf-Anlagen/juSchGenglisch,property=pdf.pdf].

In most European countries, eg. [[Poland]], one has be 18 to legally buy, drink or possess alcoholic beverages. In most countries of central, eastern, and southern Europe it is also forbidden to drink alcoholic beverages in public places, such as streets and parks.

In law, sometimes the term &quot;[[Intoxication|intoxicating]] agent&quot; is used for a category of substances, which includes alcoholic beverages and some [[recreational drug use|drugs]]. Giving any of these substances to a person to create an abnormal condition of the mind (such as [[drunkenness]]), in order to facilitate committing a crime, may be an additional crime.

Some countries may forbid the commerce, consumption or [[alcohol advertising|advertising of alcoholic beverages]], or restrict them in various ways. During the period known as [[Prohibition]], from [[1919]] to [[1933]], it was illegal to manufacture, transport, import, export, or sell alcoholic beverages in the [[United States]]. Many [[Muslim]] countries, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], continue to prohibit alcohol for religious reasons. In the United States there are still communities with a ban on alcohol sales.

Most countries have laws against [[drunk driving]], driving with a certain concentration of ethanol in the [[blood]]. The legal threshold of [[blood alcohol content]] ranges from 0.0% to 0.05% or 0.08%, according to local law.

Most countries also specify a legal drinking age, below which the consumption of alcohol is prohibited. In the U.S., the legal age for purchase or possession (but not necessarily consumption) in every state has been [[twenty-one|21]] since the passage of the [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act]] in [[1984]], which tied federal highway funds to states' raising their minimum drinking age to 21. Many states specifically permit consumption under the age of 21 for religious or health reasons or with parental approval. Most European countries however, have a legal drinking age of [[eighteen|18]]

In many countries, production of alcoholic beverages requires a license, and alcohol production is taxed. In the U.S., the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]] and the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (formerly one organization known as the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]]) enforce federal laws and regulations related to alcohol, though most regulations regarding serving and selling alcoholic beverages are made by the individual states. There also exist intrastate regulatory differences, as between [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] and the rest of the [[Maryland|state]].  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the [[Customs and Excise department]] issues distilling licences.

In many countries bars fall under [[Smoking ban|Smoking bans]], see [[List of smoking bans]] for a full listing.

Common state regulations in the United States are:

* Many U.S. states require that distilled liquor be sold only in dedicated ''liquor stores''. For example: In [[Washington]], liquor stores are run by the state. In [[Oklahoma]], liquor stores may not refrigerate any beverages. Often, liquor sales are prohibited on Sunday by a [[Blue law]]. Other laws, governing a variety of issues, vary regionally.

* Most U.S. states do not allow ''open containers'' of alcohol inside of moving vehicles.

* Some U.S. states offer relaxed rules for beer at or below 3.2% alcohol.

* Many cities and counties ban drinking alcoholic beverages in public; that is, on the street or sidewalk.

* Often bars serving distilled liquor are exempted from [[Smoking ban|Smoking bans]].

In [[New Zealand]] it is legal to produce alcohol for personal use. This has made the sale and use of home distillation equipment popular.

Some religions&amp;mdash;most notably [[Islam]], [[Latter-day Saint]]s, the [[Nikaya Buddhism|Nikaya]] and most [[Mahayana]] schools of [[Buddhism]] and some [[Protestant]] sects of [[Fundamentalist Christianity]]&amp;mdash;forbid or discourage the consumption of alcoholic beverages for these and other reasons. See also:[[Teetotalism]], [[Temperance movement]].

==Types of alcoholic beverages==
{{main|List of alcoholic beverages}}
Alcoholic beverages include low-alcohol-content beverages produced by [[fermentation]] of [[sugar]]- or [[starch]]-containing products, and high-alcohol-content beverages produced by [[distillation]] of the low-alcohol-content beverages. Sometimes, the alcohol content of low-alcohol-content beverages is increased by adding distilled products, particularly in the case of wines. Such [[fortified wine]]s include [[Port wine]] and [[Sherry]].

The process involved (as well as the resulting alcohol content) defines the finished product.  [[Beer]] involves a relatively short (incomplete) fermentation process and an equally short aging process (a week or two) resulting in an alcohol content generally between 3-8%, as well as natural carbonation.  [[Wine]] involves a longer (complete) fermentation process, and a relatively long aging process (months or years -- sometimes decades) resulting in an alcohol content between 7-18%.  [[Sparkling wine]] is generally made by adding a small amount of sugar before bottling, which causes a secondary fermentation to continue in the bottle.  Distilled products are generally not made from a &quot;beer&quot; that would  normally be palatable as fermentation is normally completed, but no aging is involved until after distillation. Most are 30% or greater alcohol by volume. [[Liqueur|Liqueurs]] are characterized by the way in which their flavors are infused and typically have high sugar content. Spirits typically contain 37.5% alcohol or greater and are not infused with flavors during the distilling process, however some modern spirits are infused with flavors after distilling for example the swedish vodka [[Absolut Vodka|Absolut]].

Standard drinks of alcoholic beverages in the United States all contain equivalent amounts of alcohol, about 0.6 fl. oz. (american) each (17.75ml). A U.S. standard drink is a 12 ounce can or bottle of beer, a five ounce glass of dinner wine, or a 1.5 ounce drink of 40% distilled spirits (either straight or in a mixed drink).

In the UK alcohol content is measured in units. One unit equates to 10ml of pure ethanol (approx. 1/3 fl. oz. american). A typical pint of beer or large glass of containing approx 2 units. A shot (25ml) of 40% spirit contains exatly 1 unit.

The names of some beverages are determined by the source of the material fermented:

|}

Note that in common speech, ''wine'' or ''brandy'' is made from grapes unless the fruit is specified: &quot;plum wine&quot; or &quot;cherry brandy&quot; for example, although in some cases grape-derived alcohol is added.

In the USA and Canada, ''cider'' often means ''unfermented'' apple juice (see the article on [[cider]]), while fermented cider is called ''hard'' cider. Unfermented cider is sometimes called ''sweet'' cider. Also, [[applejack]] was originally made by a freezing process described in the article on [[cider]] which was equivalent to distillation but more easily done in the cold climate of [[New England]]. In the UK, cider is always alcoholic, and in Australia it can be either.

''Beer'' is generally made from barley, but can sometimes contain a mix of other grains.  ''Whisky'' is sometimes made from a blend of different grains, especially [[Irish whiskey]] which may contain several different grains.  The style of whisky (Scotch, Rye, Bourbon) generally determines the primary grain used, with additional grains usually added to the blend (most often barley, and sometimes [[oat]]s).

Two common distilled beverages are [[vodka]] and [[gin]]. Vodka can be distilled from any source ([[Cereal|grain]] and [[potato|potatoes]] being the most common) but the main characteristic of vodka is that it is so thoroughly distilled as to exhibit none of the flavors derived from its source material. Gin is a similar distillate which has been flavored by contact with herbs and other plant products, especially [[juniper]] berries.  The name comes from the Dutch liquor genever, which in turn takes its name from the Dutch word for juniper.

'''Austria-Hungary''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Österreich-Ungarn'', [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Osztrák-Magyar Monarchia'', [[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Rakousko-Uhersko'', [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Rakúsko-Uhorsko'', [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Austro-Ugarska''), also known as the '''Dual Monarchy''' or '''[[K.u.K.]] Monarchy''', was a dual-monarchic union state ([[1867]] - [[1918]]) in [[Central Europe]].

It replaced the [[Austrian Empire]] ([[1806]] - [[1867]]) on the same territory and originated in a [[Ausgleich|compromise]] between the ruling [[Habsburg]] dynasty and the Hungarians in order to maintain the state. As a multi-national [[empire]] in an era of [[nationalism|national]] awakening, it found its political life dominated by disputes among the eleven principal national groups. Its economic and social life was marked by a rapid economic growth through the age of [[industrialization]] and social modernization through many liberal and democratic reforms. 

The [[Habsburg]] dynasty ruled as [[Emperors of Austria]] over the western and northern half of the country and as [[Kings of Hungary]] over the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] which enjoyed some degree of self-government and representation in joint affairs (principally foreign relations and defence). The federation bore the full name of &quot;The Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council and the [[Lands of the Holy Crown of St. Stephen|Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen]]&quot;. 

Capital of the union state was [[Vienna]].

==The lands of the Empire==
Many texts refer to the non-Hungarian (&quot;Austrian&quot;) half part of Austria-Hungary as [[Cisleithania]] -- because most of its territory lay west (or to &quot;this&quot; side, from an Austrian perspective) of the [[Leitha]] river (although Galicia to the north-east also counted as &quot;Austrian&quot;). This region (consisting of more than simply [[Austria]]) strictly speaking had no collective official name prior to 1915, and hence official sources referred to the &quot;Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council&quot;. (The Imperial Council (''[[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]]'') functioned as Cisleithania's parliament.) Similarly, the [[Transleithania]]n (&quot;Hungarian&quot;) half also consisted of more than simply Hungary, and bore the official designation of the Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen&quot; -- a reference to the [[saint|canonised]] first [[Christianity|Christian]] king of Hungary.

The &quot;Kingdoms and Lands&quot; of the Cisleithanian half of the Empire:
* the Kingdom of [[Bohemia]]; see [[Czech lands: 1867-1918]]
* the Kingdom of [[Dalmatia]]
* the Kingdom of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia and Lodomeria]]
* the Archduchy of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] (as [[Upper Austria]] and [[Lower Austria]])
* the Duchy of [[Bukowina]]
* the Duchy of [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]]
* the Duchy of [[Carniola]]
* the Duchy of [[Salzburg]]
* the Duchy of [[Upper Silesia]] and [[Lower Silesia]]
* the Duchy of [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]]
* the Margravate of [[Moravia]]; see [[Czech lands: 1867-1918]]
* the Princely County of [[Tyrol]] (including the Land of [[Vorarlberg]]),
* the [[Austrian Littoral]] (''Küstenland'', including the Princely County of [[Gorizia and Gradisca]], the City of [[Trieste]] and the Margravate of [[Istria]]). 

The &quot;Lands&quot; of the Transleithanian half of the Empire:
* the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]- including [[Transylvania]] and [[Vojvodina]]
* the Kingdom of [[Croatia]] and [[Slavonia]]
* the City of [[Rijeka|Fiume]]. 

[[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] formed a separate part of the Empire, jointly administered by both halves.

==Creation of Austria-Hungary &amp;mdash; the Compromise of 1867==
The ''[[Ausgleich]]'' (&quot;Compromise&quot;; kiegyezés in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) of February 1867 which inaugurated the Empire's dualist structure in place of the former unitary Austrian Empire ([[1804]]-1867) originated at a time when Austria had declined in strength and in power -- both in the [[Italy | Italian]] peninsula (as a result of the [[Austro-Sardinian War]] of [[1859]]) and in greater Germany (culminating in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of [[1866]]). Other factors in the constitutional changes included continued Hungarian dissatisfaction with rule from Vienna, and increasing national consciousness on the part of other nationalities of the Austrian Empire. Hungarian dissatisfaction grew partially from Austria's suppression, with [[Russia]]n support, of the [[Revolution of 1848|Hungarian liberal revolution]] of [[1848]] &amp;ndash; [[1849]]. However, dissatisfaction with Austrian rule had grown for many years within Hungary, and had many causes.

In an effort to shore up support for the monarchy, Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria | Franz Joseph]] began negotiations for a compromise with the [[Magyars | Magyar]] nobility to ensure their support. Some members of the government, such as Austrian prime minister [[Richard von Belcredi|Count Belcredi]], advised the Emperor to make a more comprehensive constitutional deal with all of the nationalities that would have created a federal structure. Belcredi worried that an accommodation with the Magyar interests would alienate the other nationalities. However, Franz Joseph was unable to ignore the power of the Magyar nobility, and they would not accept anything less than dualism between themselves and the traditional Austrian élites.

In particular, Hungarian leaders demanded and received the Emperor's coronation as King of Hungary as a re-affirmation of Hungary's historic privileges, and the establishment of a separate parliament at [[Budapest]] with the powers to enact laws for the historic lands of the Hungarian crown (the lands of [[Stephen I of Hungary | St Stephen]]), though on a basis which would preserve the political dominance of Hungarian minority (more specifically of the country's nobility and educated élite) and the exclusion from effective power of the country's large [[Romanians|Romanian]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] populations.

==Governmental structure==
Three distinct elements ruled Austria-Hungary:
# the Hungarian government
# the “Austrian” or Cisleithanian government
# a unified administration under the monarch
Hungary and Austria maintained separate [[parliament]]s, each with its own [[prime minister]]. Linking/co-ordinating the two fell to a government under a monarch, wielding power absolute in theory but limited in practice. The monarch’s common government had responsibility for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|army]], for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|navy]], for foreign policy, and for the [[customs union]]. 

Within Cisleithania and Hungary certain regions, such as Galicia and Croatia, but not the Slovak lands, enjoyed special status with their own unique governmental structures.

A common Ministerial Council ruled the common government: it comprised the three ministers for the joint responsibilities (joint finance, military, and foreign policy), the two prime ministers, some Archdukes and the monarch.  Two delegations of representatives, one each from the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, met separately and voted on the expenditures of the Common Ministerial Council, giving the two governments influence in the common administration. However, the ministers ultimately answered only to the monarch, and he had the final decision on matters of foreign and military policy.

Overlapping responsibilities between the joint ministries and the ministries of the two halves caused friction and inefficiencies. The armed forces suffered particularly from overlap. Although the unified government determined overall military direction, the Austrian and Hungarian governments each remained in charge of &quot;the quota of recruits, legislation concerning [[compulsory military service]], transfer and provision of the armed forces, and regulation of the civic, non-military affairs of members of the armed forces&quot;. Needless to say, each government could have a strong influence over common governmental responsibilities. Each half of the Dual Monarchy proved quite prepared to disrupt common operations to advance its own interests.

Relations over the half-century after 1867 between the two halves of the Empire (in fact the Cisleithan part contained about 57% of the combined realm's population and a rather larger share of its economic resources) featured repeated disputes over shared external tariff arrangements and over the financial contribution of each government to the common treasury. Under the terms of the ''Ausgleich'', an agreement, renegotiated every ten years, determined these matters. Each build-up to the renewal of the agreement saw political turmoil. The disputes between the halves of the empire culminated in the mid-[[1900s]] in a prolonged constitutional crisis -- triggered by disagreement over the language of command in Hungarian army units, and deepened by the advent to power in Budapest (April [[1906]]) of a Hungarian nationalist coalition. Provisional renewals of the common arrangements occurred in October [[1907]] and in November [[1917]] on the basis of the ''status quo''.

&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
[[Czechs]] (the majority in the [[Czech lands]], i.e.[[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and Austrian [[Silesia]]), [[Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]] (in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]), [[Slovenes]] (in [[Carniola]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]] and southern [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], mostly today's [[Slovenia]]) and [[Croats]], [[Italy|Italians]] and [[Slovenes]] in [[Istria]] each sought a greater say in Cisleithan affairs.

At the same time, Magyar dominance faced challenges from the local majorities of [[Romanians]] in [[Transylvania]] and in the eastern [[Banat]], of [[Slovaks]] in today's [[Slovakia]], of [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] in the crownlands of [[Croatia]] and of [[Dalmatia]] (today's [[Croatia]]), in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and in the provinces known as the [[Vojvodina]] (today's northern [[Serbia]]). The Romanians and the Serbs also looked to union with their fellow-nationalists in the newly-founded states of [[Romania]] (1859 - 1878) and [[Serbia]]. 

Though Hungary's leaders showed on the whole less willingness than their German Austrian counterparts to share power with their subject minorities, they granted (it is argued) a large measure of autonomy to the kingdom of [[Croatia]] in [[1868]], parallelling to some extent their own accommodation within the Empire the previous year. 
[[Image:austria hungary 1911.jpg|thumb|left|300px|&quot;Distribution of Races in Austria-Hungary&quot; from the Historical Atlas by William R. Shepherd, 1911]]
Language was one of the most contentious questions in Austro-Hungarian politics. All governments faced difficult and divisive hurdles in sorting out the languages of government and of instruction. Minorities wanted to ensure the widest possibility for education in their own language as well as in the &quot;dominant&quot; languages of Hungarian and German. On one notable occasion, that of the so-called &quot;ordinance of April 5, 1897&quot;, the Austrian Prime Minister [[Kasimir Felix Graf Badeni]] gave Czech equal standing with German in the internal government of [[Bohemia]], leading to a crisis because of nationalist German agitation throughout the Empire. In the end Badeni was dismissed. On another occasion, the Czechs lost the privilege of using their own language in everyday life, including newspapers and in the workplace: Czechs had to use German. This caused general chaos.

From January 1907 all the public and private schools in Slovak part (aprox. 3 mil. people) of Hungary were forced to teach in Hungarian language only, burning Slovak books and newspapers. This led to wide criticism by [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] among others. 

It was not rare for the two kingdoms to divide spheres of influence.  According to [[Misha Glenny]] (''The Balkans, 1804-1999''), the Austrians responded to Hungarian badgering of Czechs by supporting the Croatian national movement in Zagreb.  (Croatia, in spite of nominal autonomy, was in fact an economic and administrative arm of Hungary; this the Croats resented.)

==Economy==
[[Image:BanknoteA-H.jpg|thumb|250px|A banknote of the Dual Monarchy]]
The Austro-Hungarian economy changed dramatically during the existence of the Dual Monarchy. Technological change accelerated [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]]. The [[capitalist]] mode of production spread throughout the Empire during its fifty-year existence.  The old institutions of [[feudalism]] continued to disappear. Economic growth centred around Vienna, the Austrian lands (areas of modern Austria), the Alpine lands, and the Bohemian lands. In the later years of the nineteenth century rapid economic growth spread to the central Hungarian plain and to the Carpathian lands. As a result of this pattern wide disparities of development existed within the Empire. In general the western areas achieved far more development than the east. By the early 20th century most of the Empire had started to  experience rapid economic growth. The [[GNP]] per capita grew roughly 1.45% per year from 1870 to 1913. That level of growth compared very favourably to that of other European nations such as Britain (1.00%), France (1.06%), and Germany (1.51%). (Source: Good, David. ''The Economic Rise of the Habsburg Empire''). However, the Empire's economy as a whole still lagged considerably behind the economies of other powers, as it had only begun sustained modernization much later. Britain had a GNP per-capita almost three times larger than the Habsburg Empire, while Germany's stood almost twice as high as Austria-Hungary's. Nonetheless, these large discrepancies hide different levels of development within the Empire.

[[Rail transport]] expanded rapidly in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its predecessor state, the [[Habsburg Empire]], had built a substantial core of railways in the west originating from Vienna by [[1841]]. At that point the government realized the military possibilities of rail and began to invest heavily in their construction. [[Bratislava]], Budapest, Prague, [[Kraków]], [[Graz]], Laibach ([[Ljubljana]]), and [[Venice]] became linked to the main network. By 1854 the Empire had almost 2000 kilometres of track, about 60 to 70% of it in state hands. At that point the government began to sell off large portions of track to private investors to recoup some of its investments and because of the financial strains of the [[1848 Revolution]] and of the [[Crimean War]]. 

From [[1854]] to [[1879]] private interests conducted almost all rail construction. What would become Cisleithania gained 7952 track kilometres, and Hungary built 5839 track kilometres.  During this time many new areas joined the railway system  and the existing rail networks gained connections and interconnections. This period marked the beginning of widespread rail transportation in Austria-Hungary, and also the integration of transportation systems in the area. Railways allowed the Empire to integrate its economy far more than previously possible, when transportation depended on rivers.

After 1879 the Austro-Hungarian government slowly began to re-nationalize the rail network, largely because of the sluggish pace of development during the worldwide [[depression (economics)|depression]] of the [[1870s]]. The years between 1879 and [[1900]] saw more than 25,000 km of railways built in Cisleithania and Hungary. Most of this constituted &quot;filling in&quot; of the existing network, although some areas, primarily in the far east, gained rail connections for the first time during this period. The railroad reduced transportation costs throughout the Empire, opening new markets for products from other lands of the Dual Monarchy.

==Foreign policy==
The Imperial (Austrian) and Royal (Hungarian) governments differed also to some extent in their attitude toward the Empire's common foreign policy. Politicians in Budapest particularly feared annexations of territory which would add to the kingdom's non-Hungarian populations. But the Empire's alliance with [[Germany]] against [[Russia]] from October [[1879]] (see [[Dual Alliance, 1879]]) commanded general acceptance, since Russia seemed the principal external military threat to both parts. 

Austro-Hungarian forces occupied the territory of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] from August [[1878]] under the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878 | Treaty of Berlin]]. The Empire annexed this territory in October [[1908]] as a common holding under the control of the finance ministry rather than attaching it to either territorial government. The annexation set up an anomalous situation which led some in Vienna to contemplate combining Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croatia to form a third component of the Empire, uniting its southern Slav regions under the domination of Croats (who might have proved more sympathetic to [[Vienna]] than to Budapest). 

==World War I==
[[Image:Schildoh.png|thumb|150px|right|Coat of Arms of Austria-Hungary, adopted in [[1915]] to emphasize the unity of the Empire during [[World War I]].]]
On [[June 28]], [[1914]], [[Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria]], heir presumptive to his uncle the Emperor [[Franz Josef I of Austria|Franz Josef]] (Franz Josef's [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria|only son]] had died under still-mysterious circumstances, and Mexican republicans had executed the [[Maximilian of Mexico|Emperor's brother]]), visited the Bosnian capital [[Sarajevo]] where Bosnian Serb militants of the nationalist group Mlada Bosna, supplied by the violent Serbian militant group [[Black Hand]], ambushed his convoy and assassinated him. ''See: [[Assassination in Sarajevo]]''

After the [[Congress of Berlin]] the Empire's military spending didn't even double, while that of Germany rose fivefold, and British, Russian and French rose threefold. The Empire had previously lost ethnically Italian areas to [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] due to nationalist movements sweeping through Italy, and many Austro-Hungarians felt the threat of losing the southern territories inhabited by Slavs to [[Serbia]] as imminent. Serbia had recently gained a significant amount of territory in the [[Second Balkan War]] of 1913, causing much distress in government circles in Vienna and Budapest. Some members of the government, such as [[Conrad von Hötzendorf]] had wanted to confront the resurgent Serbian nation for some years. The leadership of Austria-Hungary, especially Count Leopold von Berchtold, backed by its ally [[Germany]], decided to confront Serbia militarily before it could incite a revolt: using the assassination as an excuse, they presented a list of [[ten demands]] [http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/austrianultimatum.htm] expecting Serbia would never accept. When Serbia accepted nine of the ten demands but only partially accepted the remaining one, Austria-Hungary declared war.

These events brought the Empire into conflict with Serbia and over the course of July and August 1914, caused the start of [[World War I]], as Russia mobilized in support of Serbia, setting off a series of counter-mobilizations.

[[Italy]] initially remained neutral, although it had an alliance with Austria-Hungary. In 1915 it switched to the side of the [[Entente powers]], hoping to gain territory from Austria-Hungary.

General Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf was the Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff during the war. Under his command, Austro-Hungarian troops initially crushed Serbia, defended the routes into Hungary and repulsed Italian advances in [[Gorizia]]. The Russians then began considerable war aid to their slavic Serbian allies.  The [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] suffered very serious casualties throughout the war. However, they had considerable successes (albeit with German aid and direction) even advancing into enemy territory following  the German-led victory in Galicia (May 1915), taking [[Belgrade]] despite the heroics of Serbian General Radomir Putnik (October 1915),  and again with the Germans at [[Battle of Caporetto | Caporetto]] on the Italian front (October 1917), sending the [[Italian First Army]] reeling in retreat. As World War I dragged on, the Austro-Hungarian war effort had become more and more subordinate to the direction of German planners. Supply shortages, low morale, and the high casualty rate began to seriously affect the operational abilities of the army by the last years of the war.

In June 1918, Conrad attempted a double edged offensive with the bulk of remaining Austro-Hungarian forces. Its failure left the empire vulnerable, and in October 1918 an Italian-led [[Allies of World War I | Allied]] army attacked, gaining victory in the battle of [[Vittorio Veneto]], destroying the last of the Austrian Army and ended the Habsburg Empire.

==Dissolution of the Empire==
[[Image:Austria obituary.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A humorous &quot;obituary&quot; of the Austrian Empire, published in [[Kraków]] in late 1918. Click on the image to read a translation.]]
As it became apparent that the Allied Powers of the United Kingdom, France, Italy and the United States would win World War I, nationalist movements which had previously been calling for a greater degree of autonomy for various areas, started pressing for full independence. With defeat in the war imminent, Czechoslovakia declared independence on [[28 October]] [[1918]] and on [[29 October]] the southern slav areas declared the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. In [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]], separate republics were declared at the end of the war in November. The [[treaty of Saint Germain]] between the victors of World War I and Austria, and the [[treaty of Trianon]] between the victors and Hungary regulated the dissolution of Austria-Hungary. The last Habsburg emperor-king, [[Karl I of Austria|Karl I]] (styled Károly IV in Hungary), renounced participation in affairs of state (but did not abdicate) and fled to [[Switzerland]].

A monarchist revival in Hungary after a short-lived [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|communist revolution]] and the Romanian intervention of [[1919]] resulted in the restoration of the Hungarian  monarchy (March [[1920]]), with the royal powers entrusted to a [[regent]], the naval hero Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]]. Ill prepared attempts by [[Karl I of Austria|Karl]] to regain the throne in Budapest (March, October [[1921]]) collapsed when the initially wavering Horthy, who had received threats of intervention from the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] and neighboring countries, refused his cooperation. Subsequently the British took custody of Karl and removed him and his family to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] island of [[Madeira]], where he died the following year.

The following successor states were formed (entirely or in part) from the former Habsburg lands:
* [[Austria]]
* [[Hungary]]
* [[Czechoslovakia]]
* [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] (joined with the Kingdom of [[Serbia]] on [[1 December]] [[1918]] to form the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later [[Yugoslavia]])
* [[Poland]]

Some Austro-Hungarian lands were also ceded to [[Romania]] and [[Italy]]. [[Liechtenstein]], which had formerly looked to Vienna for protection, formed a customs and defence union with [[Switzerland]], and adopted the Swiss currency instead of the Austrian. In April 1919 [[Vorarlberg]], the westernmost province of Austria, voted by a large majority to join Switzerland; however both the Swiss and the Allies disregarded this result.

==Historiography==
Historical views of Austria-Hungary have varied throughout the 20th century:

Historians in the early part of the century tended to have emotional and/or personal involvement with the issues surrounding Austria-Hungary. Nationalist historians tended to view the Habsburg polity as [[despot]]ic and obsolete. Other scholars, usually associated with the old government, became apologists for the traditional leadership and tried to explain their policies.

* Major writers from the early period who remain influential include: Oskar Jászi and Josef Redlich.

Subsequent experience of the region's inter-war &quot;[[Balkanization]]&quot;, of [[Nazi]] occupation, and then  of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] domination, led to a more sympathetic interpretation of the Empire, based primarily in a large exiled community in the United States. Meanwhile, Marxist historians still tended to judge the Empire in a negative way.

* Major scholars of this period include: C. A Macartney, Robert A. Kann, Charles Ingrau and Arthur J. May.

One controversy among historians remains: whether the Empire faced inevitable collapse as the result of a decades-long decline; or whether it would have survived in some form in the absence of military defeat in World War I. 

* [[Alan Sked]] has advanced the view that, &quot;to speak of decline and fall with regard to the Monarchy is simply misleading: it fell because it lost a major war.&quot; (''The Decline and Fall of the Habsburg Empire 1815&amp;ndash;1918'')

* David F. Good supports Sked's view.

* Others, such as Solomon Wank, remain skeptical.

==Territorial legacy==
The current countries whose entire territory were located inside Austria-Hungary by the time of the dissolution of the empire are:

*[[Austria]]

*[[Hungary ]]

*[[Czech Republic]]
