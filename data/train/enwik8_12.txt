==Team Rivalries==
Games in which teams with rivalries typically draw large crowds and interest regardless of both teams positions on the ladder.  Collingwood is a famous club in the league because it is a rival of almost all other traditional clubs and also known as the 'team people love to hate'.

===Traditional Rivals===
* [[Carlton Football Club | Carlton]] v [[Collingwood Football Club | Collingwood]]&lt;br&gt;Arguably the greatest and longest standing rivalry in the competition.  Two working class clubs in close proximity, fuelled by the 1970 Grand Final in which Carlton extinguished hopes of Collingwood breaking a premiership drought.  Games between these two clubs regularly attract large crowds regardless of whether they are both at the bottom of the ladder.

* [[Richmond Football Club | Richmond]] v [[Collingwood Football Club | Collingwood]] &lt;br&gt;Arising from the fact that the two areas neighbour each other,and that Richmond supporters often mocked Collingwood suppoters whom they thought were &quot;feral&quot;. also Richmond and Collingwood were both highly successful in the late 1920's to the early 1930's, meeting each other in several grand finals . 

* [[Melbourne Football Club | Melbourne]] v [[Collingwood Football Club | Collingwood]] &lt;br&gt;As per Richmond vs Collingwood but additionally fuelled by a narrow loss to Collingwood which stopped Melbourne from winning a fourth flag in a row in 1958. And the fact that Melbourne played half their premierships against them.

* [[Essendon Football Club | Essendon]] v [[Collingwood Football Club | Collingwood]]&lt;br&gt;Arising from the inaugural [[ANZAC Day]] clash and Essendon's loss to Collingwood in the 1990 Grand Final.  Games between these sides draw large crowds.

* [[Essendon Football Club | Essendon]] v [[Carlton Football Club | Carlton]] &lt;br&gt;As is the case with two successful sides in any competition, fans of each club love to defeat the other.

=== Local Derbies===
* [[Adelaide Football Club | Adelaide]] v [[Port Adelaide Football Club | Port Adelaide]] &lt;br&gt;Known as The Showdown

* [[West Coast Eagles | West Coast]] v [[Fremantle Football Club | Fremantle]] &lt;br&gt;Known as The [[Western Derby]]

===More Recent Rivals===
* [[Brisbane Lions|Brisbane]] v [[Sydney Swans | Sydney]] &lt;br&gt;Two frontier states for the AFL, the AFL uses the [[Rugby League]] [[State of Origin]] rivalry between [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]] to draw crowds to games between these teams.

* [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] v [[Geelong Football Club | Geelong]] &lt;br&gt; The first 2 clubs in the league.  Melbourne CEO [[Steve Harris]] once made comments about how Melbourne people never like to travel to Geelong, with this rivalry being manufactured by the AFL in the recent [[AFL Rivalry Round]] concept. 

* [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] v [[Hawthorn Football Club | Hawthorn]] &lt;br&gt; The  clubs contested the Grand Final on several occasions in the 1980s.

* [[Brisbane Lions|Brisbane]] v [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] &lt;br&gt; The two sides who clashed in the 2001 Grand Final, has since developed into a great rivalry thanks to respective coaches Leigh Matthews (Brisbane) and Kevin Sheedy (Essendon), with several famous clashes already.

* [[Brisbane Lions|Brisbane]] v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] &lt;br&gt; The Brisbane Lions defeated Collingwood in the 2002 and 2003 Grand Final, which caused Grand Final Rematches and great rivalry between the two teams. This continued onwards with many Lions fans disliking Collingwood, and their President [[Eddie McGuire]].

* [[Brisbane Lions|Brisbane]] v [[Port Adelaide Power|Port Adelaide]] &lt;br&gt; The two sides who dominated the AFL from 2001-2004, they had identical winning percentages over the four years. The Lions won three consecutive titles (2001-2003), while Port developed a reputation as chokers in big matches until they won the 2004 title, defeating Brisbane in that decieder. Matches between the two are always hard fought encounters. The two sides have also drawn on two occasions, in 1997 and 1998.

* [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] v [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] &lt;br&gt; The rivalry started when Essendon coach Kevin Sheedy celebrated a victory by running down from the coaches box to the ground waving his jacket around his head. Now the fans of the victorious team in these clashes celebrate the victory by waving their jackets.

* [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] v [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] &lt;br&gt;Currently Victoria's two best teams. Both have reasonably young teams making their mark in AFL.

===Past Rivals===
* [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] v [[South Melbourne Football Club|South Melbourne]] &lt;br&gt;These clubs shared the same geographical area until the Swans moved to Sydney.  These teams played for the 'Lake Trophy'.

* [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] v [[Fitzroy Football Club | Fitzroy]] &lt;br&gt;As with St Kilda and South Melbourne, these clubs shared the same geographical area until Fitzroy folded (and was absorbed by Brisbane) and began a new rivalry with Collingwood from successive Grand Final encounters.

===Rivalries which remain &quot;untapped&quot;===
* [[Richmond Football Club | Richmond]] v [[Fremantle Dockers | Fremantle]] &lt;br&gt;Richmond was Fremantle's first opponent in 1995, and later in the season became the first team to play the Dockers twice.  Comedian [[Trevor Marmalade]] joked at the time that this made the two teams &quot;traditional rivals&quot;.  Interestingly, many matches between the two teams have been close contests, but neither side seems to consider the other a closely-matched rival.

==Future==
Several areas have been discussed as expansion possibilities, most often [[Tasmania]], western [[Sydney]], North [[Queensland]], the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Canberra]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and even [[New Zealand]] or [[South Africa]], but the AFL have an aim to keep the competition to 16 teams.  It is generally thought that if the AFL expands into a new area, one of the less financially well-off Victorian clubs will re-locate, rather than an entirely new club being formed. The Western Bulldogs and Kangaroos are most often considered candidates for re-location, and some theorise that their respective name changes in the 1990s were in anticipation of such a move. 

Having experimented with home games in Western [[Sydney]], the Kangaroos play regular premiership season games at [[Manuka Oval]] in Canberra, and the Bulldogs have played in [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], leading to more speculation that they are attempting to build a supporter base in those areas for future re-location.  

Mergers have also been an option for the AFL, as was seen with the Brisbane Bears and the defunct Fitzroy Lions in 1996. If two Victorian teams merge, then it makes room for a 16th team to come from an interstate city - the likely candidates for this are the [[Southport Sharks]] or a Tasmanian team based in [[Hobart]] or [[Launceston]]. However, that since the 1996 [[Melbourne Hawks]] merger attempt, the AFL has been less willing to actively persue the amalgamation of two Victorian-based clubs as an option.

==Hall of Fame==
For the centenary of the VFL/AFL in 1996, the [[Australian Football Hall of Fame]] was formed. Its members not only consist of those who have contributed to the VFL/AFL, but from Australian football in general (in such leagues as the [[SANFL]] and [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]]). That year 136 Australian Rules identities were inducted, including 100 players, 10 coaches, 10 umpires, 10 administrators and 6 media representatives.

===Legends of the Game===
In 1996, thirteen Hall of Fame members were declared ''Legends of the Game''. Now, each year another member of the Hall of Fame is declared a legend. The following is a list of ''Legends of the Game''.

==Team of the Century==
To celebrate the 100th season of the AFL, the &quot;AFL Team of the Century&quot; was named in 1996.

{{Aussie rules team | title = AFL Team of the Century

}}

[[Jim Elder]] was declared the ''Umpire of the Century'' was to coincide with the Team of the Century. Since the naming of this side, all AFL clubs have nominated their own teams of the century. An [[Indigenous Team of the Century]] was also selected in 2005, featuring the best Aboriginal players of the previous 100 years.

==Corporate Relations==

===Membership===
The AFL sells membership that entitle subscribers to reserve seats for matches at the [[Telstra Dome]] and [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in Melbourne and priority access to finals.  AFL Members can nominate a club to get priority Grand Final tickets.

As of [[2007]] the official Free to Air television brodcast partners will be: the [[Seven Network]] and [[Network Ten]].  The Pay TV partner, if any, is yet to be confirmed.

Before [[2001]], the [[Seven Network]] had broadcast the AFL for 45 years. The only year they didn't hold the rights was 1987, when the rights were bought by Sportsplay, a satellite channel, who then onsold the rights to the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]. In 1997, the Seven Network's main rivals created a consortium to snatch the rights from the network. Seven, however, did purchase a guaranteed last rights bid which in the future proved to be handy for the network. In January 2006, shortly after the death of media magnate [[Kerry Packer]], a Seven/Ten alliance used Seven's last rights bid to match Nine's offer of $AUD 780 million for broadcast rights in what was the biggest sport broadcasting deal in Australian history.

=====International Broadcasting=====
*[[ABC Asia Pacific]] currently broadcasts the full AFL Premiership season to more than 39 countries.  
*AFL is broadcast in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], but not free-to-air.  In the 1980s, [[ESPN]] played a highlights package called ''Fosters Australian Rules''.  The [[AFANA]] is an organisation aimed at increasing coverage in North America.

Currently, [[Fox Soccer Channel]] (in the USA) and [[Fox Sports World Canada]] show a game of the week and a weekly one-hour recap show.  The AFL Grand Final is broadcast live. The recap show also airs on various regional affiliates of [[Fox Sports Net]].

====Hall of Fame and Sensation==== 
A modern museum called the Hall of Fame and Sensation opened in Melbourne in 2003 to celebrate the culture of the AFL and the [[Australian Football Hall of Fame]]. The museum, a licenced spin-off of the AFL was originally touted for the MCG, the Hall of Fame failed to get support of the Melbourne Cricket Club, so the new QV shopping centre on Swanston Street was chosen as the location next to one of the busiest AFL shops. Later controversy surrounded the appoint meant of an administration as the museum began running at a loss. Many blamed high entry prices which were subsequently reduced and the museum remains open to the public.  Hall of Fame and Sensation features various honour boards and artefacts as well as a range of innovative interactive displays designed to emerse fans and visitors in the experience of elite aussie rules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alan Garner''' (born [[Congleton]] [[October 17]], [[1934]]) is an English writer whose work is firmly rooted in his local [[Cheshire]]. His very early writing was marketed mainly for [[Children's literature|children]] and could be described as [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]], though he himself rejects the label of &quot;children's writer&quot;:

:I do not write for children, but for myself. Adolescents read my books. By adolescence, I mean an arbitrary age somewhere between 10 and 18. This group of people is the most important of all.

His more recent work (''Strandloper'', ''Thursbitch'') is more specifically intended for adult readers, while the earlier ''[[The Stone Book Quartet]]'' (which received the [[Phoenix Award]] in 1996) is poetic in style and inspiration. Garner pays particular attention to language, and strives to render the cadence of the Cheshire tongue in modern English. This he explains by the sense of anger he felt on reading &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;: the footnotes would not have been needed by his father. This and other aspects of his writing are the subject of Neil Philip's ''[[A Fine Anger]], (Collins, 1981)'', which offers a detailed analysis of his work.

His most recent novel is ''Thursbitch''. Other works have won the Guardian Award, the Carnegie Medal,and the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award, as well as the Chicago International Film Festival 1st Prize for his educational film &quot;Images.&quot;

His collection of essays and public talks, ''[[The Voice That Thunders]]'', contains much autobiographical material, as well as critical reflection upon folklore and language, literature and education, the nature of myth and time. Garner is an accomplished public speaker.

The author [[Philip Pullman]] is a strong admirer, and ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]'' is an acknowledged classic of children's literature.

He was awarded the [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to literature in the [[2001]] [[British honours system|New Year's Honours list]].

== Works ==

His best known works are:

* ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]''
* ''[[The Moon of Gomrath]]''
* ''[[Elidor]]''
* ''[[The Owl Service]]''
* ''[[Red Shift (novel)|Red Shift]]''
* ''[[The Stone Book Quartet]]''
* ''[[The Voice That Thunders]]''
* ''[[Strandloper]]''
* ''[[Thursbitch]]''

He has also edited a collection of stories about fools, ''The Guizer'' (1975).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], an '''algebraic number''' relative to a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is any element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of a given field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a solution of a [[polynomial]] [[equation]] of the form: ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; + ··· + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0
where ''n'' is a [[positive integer]] called the ''degree'' of the polynomial, every coefficient ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is an element of ''F'', and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is nonzero. If the field ''F'' is the field '''Q''' of [[rational number]]s and ''K'' is an [[algebraically closed field]] then the algebraic numbers relative to '''Q''' are simply called '''algebraic numbers'''. The [[algebraically closed field]] in which these numbers lie can be the [[complex number]]s '''C''', but sometimes other fields are used. Any such [[algebraic closure]] is unique [[up to]] field [[isomorphism]], but may differ in topological properties. Considered purely as a field it is unique, and it is either this abstract field devoid of topology or the closure of the rationals in the complex numbers which is most often called the field of algebraic numbers.

All rationals are algebraic. A [[real number|real]] number that is not rational may or may not be algebraic; for example  [[irrational number]]s such as 2&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; (the [[square root]] of 2) and 3&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;/2 (half the [[cube root]] of 3) are also algebraic because they are the solutions of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0
and 8''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, respectively. But most real numbers are not algebraic; examples of this are [[Pi|&amp;pi;]] and ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''.
If a complex number is not an algebraic number then it is called a [[transcendental number]]. So, for instance ''i'', the [[imaginary unit]], is an algebraic number since it satisfies 
''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; however &lt;math&gt;i^i&lt;/math&gt; is transcendental by the [[Gelfond-Schneider theorem]]; one branch of this number is e&lt;sup&gt;-&amp;pi;/2&lt;/sup&gt;, which shows that e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/sup&gt; is also transcendental.

If an algebraic number satisfies such an equation as given above with a [[polynomial]] of degree ''n'' and not such an equation with a lower degree, then the number is said to be an ''algebraic number of degree n''.

==The field of algebraic numbers== {{main|algebraic number field}}
The sum, difference, product and quotient of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic, and the algebraic numbers therefore form a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. It can be shown that, if we allow the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; to be any algebraic numbers, then every solution of the equation will again be an algebraic number. This can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. In fact, it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals, and is therefore called the [[algebraic closure]] of the rationals.

==Numbers defined by radicals==
All numbers which can be obtained from the integers using a [[finite]] number of [[addition]]s, [[subtraction]]s, [[multiplication]]s, [[division (mathematics)|division]]s, and ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; roots (where ''n'' is a positive integer) are algebraic. The converse, however, is not true: there are algebraic numbers which cannot be written in this manner. All of these numbers are solutions to polynomials of degree &amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;5, (see [[Quintic equation]]s and the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). This is a result of [[Galois theory]]. An example of such a number would be the unique real root of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

==Algebraic integers== {{main|algebraic integer}}
An algebraic number which satisfies a [[polynomial equation]] of degree ''n'' with leading coefficient ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (that is, a [[monic polynomial]]) and all other coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; belonging to the set '''Z''' of [[integer]]s, is called an '''[[algebraic integer]]'''. Examples of algebraic integers are 3&amp;radic;{{overline|2}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5 and 6''i''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;2. 

The sum, difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers, which means that the algebraic integers form a [[ring (algebra)|ring]]. The name ''algebraic integer'' comes from the fact that the only rational numbers which are algebraic integers are the integers, and because the algebraic integers in any [[algebraic number field|number field]] are in many ways analogous to the integers. If ''K'' is a number field, its '''ring of integers''' is the subring of algebraic integers in ''K'', and is frequently denoted as ''O''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Special classes of algebraic number==
*[[Gaussian integer]]
*[[Eisenstein integer]]
*[[Quadratic irrational]]
*[[Fundamental unit]]
*[[Root of unity]]
*[[Gaussian period]]
*[[Pisot-Vijayaraghavan number]]
*[[Salem number]]

'''Ankh-Morpork''' is a [[fiction]]al [[city-state]] which features in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series of fantasy novels. As cities go, it is on the far side of corrupt and polluted, and is subject to outbreaks of comedic violence and brou-ha-ha on a fairly regular basis. It is home to the [[Unseen University]], a centre of magical learning.

Ankh-Morpork is also the mercantile capital of the [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]], and the books give an excellent flavour of a &quot;working&quot; quasi-medieval city. Even when it is under attack from a [[European dragon|dragon]], the vegetable carts still have to come in.

In ''[[The Art of Discworld]]'' Pratchett explains that the city is similar to [[Tallinn]] and central [[Prague]], but adds that it has elements of 18th century [[London]], 19th century [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] and modern [[New York, New York|New York]].  He also states that since the creation of ''The Streets of Ankh-Morpork'', he has tried to ensure that the descriptions of character movements and locations in the books match the Ankh-Morpork map; this has allowed him, and fans of the series, to visualise the story more clearly. Ankh-Morpork is also referred to as &quot;The Big Oyster&quot;, or &quot;The Big Wahooni&quot; on occasions, further increasing the bond with &quot;The Big Apple&quot;, New York.

==Geography==
Ankh-Morpork lies on the River Ankh (the most polluted waterway on the Discworld), where the fertile loam of the [[Sto Plains]] (similar to [[Western Europe]]) meets the [[Circle Sea]] (the Discworld's version of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]). This, naturally, puts it in an excellent trading position.

Lying approximately equidistant from the cold Hub and tropical Rim, Ankh-Morpork is in the Discworld's equivalent of the [[temperate]] zone.

The name &quot;Ankh-Morpork&quot; refers to both the city itself, a [[defensive wall|walled city]] about a mile (1.6 km) across, and the surrounding suburbs and farms of its [[fiefdom]].

The central city divides more or less into Ankh (the posh part) and Morpork (the humble part, which includes the slum area known as &quot;the Shades&quot;), which are separated by the River Ankh.

Ankh-Morpork is built on black loam, broadly, but mostly what it is built on is more Ankh-Morpork. Because of the nature of the Ankh-Morpork citizenry and the flooding of the River Ankh, they figured it was simply easier to build on top of the existing buildings when the sediment grew too high, rather than excavate them out. This has resulted in two things: Firstly, many people own basements and have no idea they do. Secondly, there is a &quot;cave network&quot; below Ankh-Morpork made up of old streets and abandoned sewers &amp;ndash; these &quot;unknown basements&quot; allow people to get around relatively unimpeded. The city's [[dwarf]] population have extended this into a complex network of tunnels, which has recently been made municipal property.

===The River Ankh===
Even before it enters Ankh-Morpork, the River Ankh is full of [[silt]] from the plains; by the time it gets to the seaward side of the city, &quot;even an [[agnostic]] could walk across it&quot;.

The citizens of the city are strangely proud of this fact, even going so far as to say that &quot;it is easier to suffocate than drown in the Ankh.&quot; They also claim it to be the purest water on the Disc, as &quot;Anything that's passed through so many kidneys has to be very pure indeed.&quot; Owing to the build-up of centuries, the bed of the river is higher than some parts of the city. When winter snows swell the flow, the low-rent areas of Morpork flood. In spring some parts catch fire, and others sprout small trees.

In the times when the city catches fire, the river gates are closed, and the river rises and smothers the flames.

In both ''[[Men At Arms]]'' and the computer game ''[[Discworld Noir]]'', the Ankh is described as &quot;the only river in the world on which you could draw a chalk outline&quot;.

==History==
According to legend, the first city of Ankh-Morpork was founded thousands of years ago by twin brothers who were raised by a [[hippopotamus]] (an allusion to the myth of [[Romulus and Remus]]). It is in memory of this that the hippo is the royal animal of Ankh. The original city was little more than a walled keep, surrounding the Tower of Art, a building of mysterious origin.

At one point it had an empire, similar to the [[Roman Empire]], that covered half the continent including the neighbouring country of [[Klatch]]. These were the days of the &quot;Pax Morporkia,&quot; another reference to Rome and their [[Pax Romana]].

The empire was largely the creation of General [[Minor Discworld characters#General Tacticus|Tacticus]] (an obvious pun or [[word play|play on word]]s), the greatest military mind in history. Tacticus refused to accept that the Empire was growing too big to control, and was finally shipped off to be king of [[Genua]]. As king he decided that the greatest threat to Genua was the Empire, and [[Declaration of war|declared war]] on it.

This was a [[Golden Age]], ruled by the Kings of Ankh, who are recalled in legend as wise, noble and fair. The line died out approximately 2000 years before the present, giving way to real kings who were realistically corrupt and peverse and ultimately leading to the collapse of the empire.  

Shortly before this, however, the mage [[Albert (Discworld)|Alberto Malich]] had founded Unseen University in the Tower of Art, and Ankh-Morpork continued as a service town for the wizards. 

Royalty became extremely debased and the later kings of Ankh-Morpork are recalled in history as power-mad and corrupt, or just mad; some are mentioned by name in ''[[Men at Arms]]'':

*Queen Alguinna IV
*King Artorollo (a contemporary of Alberto Malich)
*King Cirone IV
*Queen Coanna
*King Loyala the Aaargh (Had a 1.13 second rule from coronation to assassination) - ''[[The Discworld Companion]]''
*King Ludwig the Tree (Known to issue royal proclamations on the need to develop a new type of frog and similar important matters, and also responsible for the city motto &quot;Quanti Canicula Ille In Fenestra&quot;)- ''[[The Discworld Companion]]''
*King Paragore
*King Tyrril (ruled circa AM 907)
*King Veltrick III
*Webblethorpe the Unconscious

The last and worst - the euphemistically-remembered Lorenzo the Kind (the full extent of whose infamy is not revealed, save that he was said to be &quot;very fond of children&quot; and had in his dungeons &quot;machines for . . .&quot;) - was overthrown in the Ankh-Morpork Civil War of 1688 (dating from the founding of UU). The question of what to do with the deposed king (no judge would try him) was settled when he was executed by the then Commander of the City Watch, Suffer-Not-Injustice [[Samuel Vimes|Vimes]].  Known as &quot;Old Stoneface,&quot; his regicide resulted in his being banned from bearing arms (These events parallel the [[English Civil War]] of the [[1640s]], and the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] by [[Oliver Cromwell]]). Afterwards &quot;Old Stoneface&quot; (an ancestor of the current City Watch Commander [[Samuel Vimes]]) and his Ironheads ( a play on &quot;[[Roundheads]]&quot;) attempted to introduce [[democracy]], but the people voted against it. After &quot;Old Stoneface&quot; himself was overthrown, Ankh-Morpork reverted to a non-hereditary [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] system, where the leaders are still ruthless tyrants, but don't have the audacity to invoke divine right. It is, however, rumoured that the royal blood line continued and that the true king, Ironfoundersson, walks the streets of the city on a nightly basis. The  [[Havelock Vetinari|Patrician]] rules the city, and operates a specialised form of &quot;One Man, One Vote&quot; democracy: the Patrician is the Man, and he has the Vote.


Under the Patricians the city has become the mercantile and [[political capital]] of the Discworld, so much so that the Sto Plains operates under a new Pax Morporkia, which operates not on the principle of &quot;If you fight, we will kill you,&quot; but on the principle of &quot;If you fight, we will call in your mortgages.&quot;  The current Patrician has opened the city to [[dwarfs (Discworld)|dwarfs]], [[trolls (Discworld)|trolls]], [[gnomes (Discworld)|gnome]]s, humans from across the Disc and even the [[undead (Discworld)|undead]], making a truly [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] society, with both the advantages and problems that suggests. (The current Patrician's own, typically pragmatic, view on multiculturalism is &quot;[[Alloys]] are stronger.&quot;)

In recent years, the city has seen numerous changes. Most notable are: the rise of the [[semaphore (communication)|semaphore]] network (the &quot;[[clacks (Discworld)|clacks]]&quot;), the invention of the newspaper (with the help of the [[iconograph]]), and the revitalisation of the [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch|City Watch]] and the [[Ankh-Morpork Post Office]].

Civic symbols include Morporkia, a woman in a cabbage-spangled cloak and an old-fashioned helmet, carrying a shield with the civic [[heraldry|coat of arms]] and a toasting-fork symbolising &quot;something or other&quot; (compare [[Britannia]], [[Historical Columbia|Columbia]]).

==Politics==
The succession of the Patrician is normally either by assassination or revolution. It has been known for Patricians to resign, but it is very much the exception.

Power is to some degree shared with the many [[Guilds of Ankh-Morpork]] (including legalised [[Theft|Thieves]], [[Assassin|Assassins]] and &quot;[[prostitute|Seamstresses]]&quot;) and the surviving nobility. They form a sort of city council, but the Patrician has the only vote at meetings.

The current office-holder is Lord [[Havelock Vetinari]], a former [[Assassin]]. 

The nearest surviving relative of the former [[royal family]] seems to be Captain [[Carrot Ironfoundersson]], technically a dwarf. However, he has gone to some effort to keep this as quiet as possible. The origin of Corporal [[Nobby Nobbs]] remains shrouded in mystery. At one point he was identified as being a descendant of the Earl of Ankh (and therefore the next in line), but this was (probably) a deliberate deception.

A Patrician has almost absolute power over the affairs of the city and works together with the leaders of the city's [[Guilds of Ankh-Morpork|Guilds]], who are the ones who unofficially elect him in the first place. Eligible for election are members of rich and influential families. Unfortunately, almost all of the people who have held the post through the years proved once in office to be little different from a king, except that power did not pass automatically to their descendants. They were despotic, oppressive and fairly often mad.  Past Patricians have included:
*Mad Lord Snapcase (preceded Vetinari)
*Homicidal Lord Winder (preceded Snapcase)
*Deranged Lord Harmoni
*Laughing Lord Scapula
*Frenzied Earl Hargath 
*Nersh the Lunatic
*Giggling Lord Smince
*[[Olaf Quimby II]]

==Real-World Connections==
Ankh-Morpork is twinned with the town of [[Wincanton]] in [[Somerset]], in the south-west [[United Kingdom]] on the spherical [[planet]] [[Earth]] (also known as [[Minor Discworld concepts#Roundworld|Roundworld]]). The town is home to a Discworld shop called [http://www.artificer.co.uk/ The Cunning Artificer] which is named after a street in Ankh-Morpork. The fact that [[Witches (Discworld)|witches]], [[Rincewind|wizards]] and even [[The Luggage]] have been seen in the vicinity of the shop suggests that it may be one of the [[Minor Discworld concepts#Wandering_Shops|wandering shops]] encountered in ''[[The Light Fantastic]]'' and ''[[Soul Music]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], an '''automorphism''' is an [[isomorphism]] from a mathematical object to itself. It is, in some sense, a [[symmetry]] of the object, and a way of [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] the object to itself while preserving all of its structure.  The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the '''automorphism group'''. It is, loosely speaking, the [[symmetry group]] of the object.

== Definition ==

The exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of &quot;mathematical object&quot; in question and what, precisely, constitutes an &quot;isomorphism&quot; of that object. The most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called [[category theory]]. Category theory deals with abstract objects and [[morphism]]s between those objects.

In category theory, an '''automorphism''' is an [[endomorphism]] (i.e. a [[morphism]] from an object to itself) which is also an [[Category theory#Types of morphisms|isomorphism]] (in the categorical sense of the word). 

This is a very abstract definition since, in category theory, morphisms aren't necessarily functions and objects aren't necessarily sets. In most concrete settings, however, the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure.

In the context of [[abstract algebra]], for example, a mathematical object is an [[algebraic structure]] such as a [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], or [[vector space]]. An isomorphism is simply a [[bijective]] [[homomorphism]]. (Of course, the definition of a homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure; see, for example: [[group homomorphism]], [[ring homomorphism]], and [[linear operator]]).

== Automorphism group ==

The set of automorphisms of an object ''X'' form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under composition of [[morphism]]s. This group is called the '''automorphism group''' of ''X''. That this is indeed a group is simple to see:
* [[Closure (binary operation)|Closure]]: composition of two endomorphisms is another endomorphism.
* [[Associativity]]: morphism composition is associative by definition.
* [[Identity element|Identity]]: the identity is the identity morphism from an object to itself which exists by definition.
* [[Inverse element|Inverses]]: by definition every isomorphism has an inverse which is also an isomorphism, and since the inverse is also an endomorphism of the same object it is an automorphism.

The automorphism group of an object ''X'' in a category ''C'' is denoted Aut&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), or simply Aut(''X'') if the category is clear from context.

== Examples ==

*In [[set theory]], an automorphism of a set ''X'' is an arbitrary [[permutation]] of the elements of ''X''. The automorphism group of ''X'' is also called the [[symmetric group]] on ''X''.

*A group automorphism is a [[group isomorphism]] from a group to itself. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group ''G'' there is a natural group homomorphism ''G'' &amp;rarr; Aut(''G'') whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the [[center of a group|center]] of ''G''. Thus, if ''G'' is centerless it can be embedded into its own automorphism group. (See the discussion on inner automorphisms below).

*In [[linear algebra]], an endomorphism of a [[vector space]] ''V'' is a [[linear transformation|linear operator]] ''V'' &amp;rarr; ''V''. An automorphism is an invertible linear operator on ''V''. The automorphism group of ''V'' is just the [[general linear group]], GL(''V'').

*A field automorphism is a [[bijection|bijective]] [[ring homomorphism]] from a [[field (mathematics)|field]] to itself. In the case of the [[rational number]]s, '''Q''', or the [[real number]]s, '''R''', there are no nontrivial field automorphisms (this follows from the fact that such automorphisms are [[Monotonic function|order-preserving]]). In the case of the [[complex number]]s, '''C''', there is a unique nontrivial automorphism that sends '''R''' into '''R''': [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]], but there are infinitely many &quot;wild&quot; automorphisms (see the paper by Yale cited below).  Field automorphisms are important to the theory of [[field extension]]s, in particular [[Galois extension]]s. In the case of a Galois extension ''L''/''K'' the [[subgroup]] of all automorphisms of ''L'' fixing ''K'' pointwise is called the [[Galois group]] of the extension.

*The set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''', considered as a group under addition, has a unique nontrivial automorphism : negation. Considered as a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], however, it has only the trivial automorphism. Generally speaking, negation is an automorphism of any [[abelian group]], but not of a ring or field.

*In [[graph theory]] an automorphism of a graph is a permutation of the nodes that preserves edges and non-edges.  In particular, if two nodes are joined by an edge, so are their images under the permutation.

*In [[order theory]], see [[order automorphism]].

*An automorphism of a differentiable [[manifold]] ''M'' is a [[diffeomorphism]] from ''M'' to itself. The automorphism group is sometimes denoted Diff(''M'').

*In [[Riemannian geometry]] an automorphism is a self-[[isometry]]. The automorphism group is also called the [[isometry group]].

*In the category of [[Riemann surface]]s, an automorphism is a bijective [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] map (also called a [[conformal map]]), from a surface to itself. For example, the automorphisms of the [[Riemann sphere]] are [[Möbius transformation]]s.

== Inner and outer automorphisms ==

In some categories&amp;mdash;notably [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, and [[Lie algebra]]s&amp;mdash;it is possible to separate automorphisms into two classes.

In the case of groups:

The [[inner automorphism]]s are the conjugations by the elements of the group itself. For each element ''a'' of a group ''G'', conjugation by ''a'' is the operation &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; :  ''G''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''G'' given by &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') = ''aga''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. One can easily check that conjugation by ''a'' is actually a group automorphism. They form a [[normal subgroup]] of Aut(''G''), denoted by Inn(''G''). 

The other automorphisms are called [[outer automorphism]]s. The [[quotient group]] Aut(''G'')&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Inn(''G'') is usually denoted by Out(''G''); the non-trivial elements are the cosets containing the outer automorphisms.

The same definition holds in any [[unital]] [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] or [[algebra over a field|algebra]] where ''a'' is any [[Unit (ring theory)|invertible element]]. For [[Lie algebra]]s the definition is slightly different.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{SpecialChars}}[[Image:Accordion.png|thumb|right|A button accordion]]An '''accordion''' is a [[musical instrument]] of the handheld [[bellows]]-driven [[free reed aerophone]] family, sometimes referred to as [[squeezebox]]es.

The accordion is played by compression and expansion of a bellows, which generates air flow across [[reed (music)|reeds]]; a [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]] controls which reeds receive air flow and therefore the tones produced.

:''For a full description of the sound-producing mechanism, see '''[[Free reed aerophone]]'''.''

== Physical description ==
Modern accordions consists of a body in two parts, each generally rectangular in shape, separated by a bellows.  On each part of the body is a [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]] containing buttons, levers or [[piano]]-style keys.  When pressed, the buttons travel in a direction perpendicular to the motion of the bellows (towards the performer).  Most, but not all modern accordions also have buttons capable of producing entire [[chord (music)|chords]], whereas concertinas' buttons produce only single notes.

The related [[concertina]] differs in that its buttons never produce chords and travel parallel to the travel of the bellows (towards the opposite end of the instrument); there are also differences in the internal materials, construction, mechanics, and [[tone color]], but the basic principles of sound production are identical.

== History ==
The accordion is one of several [[Europe]]an inventions of the early [[19th century]] that used free reeds driven by a bellows; notable among them were:
*The [[Aeoline]], by German Bernhard Eschenbach (and his cousin, Caspar Schlimbach), [[1810]].
**Was a piano with added aeoline register.
**Aeoline Harmonika and Pysharmonika are very similar names at that time.
*** Aeoline and Aura ware first without bellows or keyboard.
*The [[Hand Physhamonika]] [[Anton Haeckel]] [[1818]] Hand type mentioned in music newspaper [[1821]].
*The [[flutina]], by Pichenot Jeune, ca. [[1831]]
*The [[concertina]], patented in two forms (perhaps independently):
**[[Carl Friedrich Uhlig]], [[1834]].
**[[Sir Charles Wheatstone]], examples built after 1829, but not patented until [[1844]]

An instrument called '''accordion''' was first patented in [[1829]] by Cyrill Demian in [[Vienna]].  (Interestingly, the original patent shows the name &quot;eoline&quot; crossed out and replaced with &quot;accordion&quot; in different handwriting).  Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments: It only had a left hand keyboard; the right hand simply operated the bellows.  One key feature for which Damian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key.  His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key: one for each bellows direction (press, draw); this is called a ''bisonoric'' action.

At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with &quot;Kanzellen&quot; (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The diatonic key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that comtemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough to for travellers to take with them and use to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both bass and treble sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.

The musician Adolph Müller described a great variety of instruments in his [[1833]]  &quot;Schule für Accordion&quot;.
At the time, Vienna and London had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.

Jeune's flutina resembles Wheatstone's concertina in internal construction and [[tone color]], but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally.  The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left.  When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today. 

Further innovations followed and continue to the present: Various keyboard systems have been developed; voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves) have been developed, with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance; different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability, and so on.

== Piano accordions ==
[[Image:KlavierAccordeon.jpg|thumbnail|right|a piano accordion]]
The '''piano accordion''' is the instrument most often indicated by the term &quot;accordion&quot;, but it is one of the most recent inventions among accordion types, appearing late in the 19th century and not accepted worldwide until the early [[20th century]].  It has a right-hand [[keyboard (music)|keyboard]] similar to a [[piano]]; this facilitates learning for musicians already familiar or proficient on the piano.

The left hand keyboard is usually configured in the [[#Stradella bass system|Stradella system]], a combination of chords and single notes, arranged in a uniform series by harmonic relationship.  Occasionally a ''free bass'' left hand is used, which has a series of single buttons in an arrangement similar to the chromatic button accordion.  The free bass system facilitates the playing of bass melodies and counterpoint.  It also allows for chord inversion and invention of chords not present in the Stradella system.

''Converter'' bass systems allow an instrument to be readily converted from a Stradella system to a free-bass system with a switch.

The instrument was popularized in the United States by Count [[Guido Deiro]] who was the first piano accordionist to perform in [[Vaudeville]]. He is credited with making the first recordings of the instrument in [[1908]], making the first [[radio]] broadcast of the accordion in [[1921]] and the first sound [[film|motion picture]] featuring the accordion, for [[Vitaphone]], in [[1928]].

== Button accordions ==
[[Image:C-Griff.svg|thumb|Chromatic button system (type C)]]
[[Image:B-Griff.svg|thumb|Chromatic button system (type B)]]
On '''button accordions''' the [[melody]]-side [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]] consists of a series of [[button]]s (rather than [[piano]]-style keys.)  There exists a wide variation in keyboard systems, tuning, action and construction of these instruments.

'''Diatonic button accordions''' have a [[melody]]-side keyboard that is  limited to the notes of [[diatonic]] [[scale (music)|scales]] in a small number of [[key (music)|keys]] (sometimes only one).  The [[bass (music)|bass]] side usually contains the principal [[chord (music)|chords]] of the instrument's key and the root notes of those chords.

[[Image:Busking_Accordionist.jpg|thumb|Garmon' player]]Almost all diatonic button accordions (e.g.: [[melodeon]]) are bisonoric, meaning each button produces two notes: one when the [[bellows]] is compressed, another while it is expanded;  a few instruments (e.g.: [[garmon']]) are unisonoric, with each button producing the same note regardless of bellows direction; still others have a combination of the two types of action: ''See [[#Hybrids|Hybrids]] below.''

A '''chromatic button accordion''' is a type of button accordion where the melody-side keyboard consists of uniform rows of buttons arranged so that the pitch increases [[chromatic scale|chromatically]] along diagonals.  The bass-side keyboard is usually the Stradella system, one of the various free-bass systems, or a converter system. Included among chromatic button accordions is the [[Russia]]n [[Bayan (accordion)|bayan]]. Sometimes an instrument of this class is simply called a '''chromatic accordion''', although other types, including the piano accordion, are fully chromatic as well. There can be 3 to 5 rows of treble buttons.  In a 5 row chromatic, two additional rows repeat the first 2 rows to facilitate options in fingering.  Chromatic button accordions are preferred by many [[European classical music|classical music]] performers, since the treble keyboard with diagonally arranged buttons allows a greater range than a piano keyboard configuration.

Various cultures have made their own versions of the accordion, adapted to suit their own music.  [[Russia]] alone has several, including the [[Bayan]], [[Garmon]], [[Livenka]], and [[Saratovskaya Garmonika]].

Various '''hybrids''' have been created between instruments of different keyboards and actions.  Many remain curiosities, only a few have remained in use.  Some notable examples are:
*The [[Schrammel accordion]], used in [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[chamber music]] and [[Klezmer]], which has the treble keyboard of a chromatic button accordion and a bisonoric bass keyboard, similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion.  
*The [[schwyzerörgeli]] or [[Switzerland|Swiss]] organ, which has a (usually) 3-row diatonic treble and 18 unisonoric bass buttons in a bass/chord arrangement (actually a subset of the Stradella system), that travel parallel to the bellows motion.
*The [[trikitixa]] of the [[Basque people]] has a 2-row diatonic, bisonoric treble and a 12-button diatonic unisonoric bass.
*In [[Scotland]], the favoured diatonic accordion is, paradoxically, the instrument known as the [[British Chromatic Accordion]]. While the right hand is bisonoric, the left hand follows the Stradella system. The elite form of this instrument is generally considered to be the German manufactured &quot;Shand Morino&quot;, produced by Hohner with the input of the late Sir Jimmy Shand. {{Ref|Howard98}}

==Stradella bass system==
[[Image:Acchords.png|thumb|right|250px|Stradella bass layout]]

The '''Stradella Bass System''' uses rows of buttons arranged in a [[circle of fifths]]; this places the principal major chords of a key in three adjacent rows.  Each row contains, in order:  A major third (the &quot;counter-bass&quot; note), the root note, the major chord, the minor chord, the seventh chord, and the diminished seventh chord.

Depending on the price, size or origin of the instrument, some rows may be missing completely or in different positions. In most Russian layouts the diminished seventh chord row is moved by one button, so that the C diminished seventh chord is where the F diminished seventh chord would be in a standard Stradella layout; this is done in order to achieve a better reachability with the forefinger.

Common configurations are:
*&quot;12 Bass&quot; accordion: Fundamental Bass goes from B&amp;#9837; to A (the third to eighth column in the picture above), and only has Fundamental Bass and major chords.
*&quot;24 Bass&quot; goes from A&amp;#9837; to A, and has Fundamental Bass, major and minor chords
*&quot;32 Bass&quot; goes from E&amp;#9837; to E, and has FB, major, minor and seventh chords
*&quot;48 Bass&quot; goes from E&amp;#9837; to E, and has all six rows
*&quot;72 Bass&quot; goes from D&amp;#9837; to F&amp;#9839;, and has all six rows
*&quot;80 Bass&quot; goes from C&amp;#9837; to G&amp;#9839;, and has everything except diminished
*&quot;96 Bass&quot; is as 80 Bass, but with all six rows
*&quot;120 Bass&quot; goes from A&amp;#9837;&amp;#9837; (i.e. low G) to A&amp;#9839; &amp;mdash; that's 20 columns &amp;mdash; with all six rows.

== Free bass systems ==
There are various free bass systems in use; most consist of a rotated version or mirror image of one of the melody layouts used in chromatic button accordions. One notable exception is the Titano line of converter bass, which repeats the first two bass rows of the Stradella system one and two octaves higher moving outward from the bellows.

Skillfull use of the free bass system enabled the performance of classical piano music, rather than music arranged specifically for the accordion's standard chorded capability. Beginning in the 1960s, competitive performance on the accordion of classical piano compositions, by the great masters of music, occurred.  Although never mainstreamed in the larger musical scene, this convergence with traditional classical music propelled young accordionists to an ultimate involvement with classical music heretofore not experienced.

Many modern and [[avant-garde]] composers (such as [[Sofia Gubaidulina]], [[Luciano Berio]] and [[Magnus Lindberg]]) have written for the free bass accordion and the instrument is becoming more frequently integrated into [[new music]] chamber and improvisation groups.

*Despite the popularity of the accordion, especially in [[polka]] music by artists such as [[Lawrence Welk]], [[Myron Floren]], [[Frankie Yankovic]] and [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]] (no relation), the instrument does have its critics. An oft-reprinted cartoon in ''[[The Far Side]]'' is a split panel in which the upper half is captioned, &quot;Welcome to Heaven... here's your harp!&quot; while the lower panel is captioned, &quot;Welcome to Hell... here's your accordion!&quot;

{{Redirect|AI}}
'''Artificial intelligence''' ('''AI''') is defined as [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] exhibited by an [[artificial]] entity. Such a system is generally assumed to be a [[computer]].

Although AI has a strong [[science fiction]] connotation, it forms a vital branch of [[computer science]], dealing with intelligent [[behavior]], [[learn]]ing and [[adaptation]] in [[machine]]s. [[Research]] in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include [[control system|control]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning and scheduling]], the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]], [[speech recognition|speech]], and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]]. As such, it has become a [[scientific]] discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems. AI systems are now in routine use in [[economics]], [[medicine]], [[engineering]] and the [[military]], as well as being built into many common home computer [[Computer software|software]] applications, traditional strategy games like [[computer chess]] and other [[video games]].

==Schools of thought==

AI divides roughly into two schools of thought: Conventional AI and [[Computational Intelligence]] (CI). 

Conventional AI mostly involves methods now classified as [[machine learning]], characterized by [[formalism]] and [[statistical analysis]]. This is also known as [[symbolic]] AI, [[logical]] AI, [[Neats|neat AI]] and [[GOFAI|Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI)]]. (Also see [[semantics]].) Methods include:
*[[Expert system]]s: apply reasoning capabilities to reach a conclusion. An expert system can process large amounts of known information and provide conclusions based on them.
*[[Case based reasoning]]
*[[Bayesian network]]s
*[[Behavior based AI]]:  a modular method of building AI systems by hand.

Computational Intelligence involves [[iterative]] development or learning (e.g. parameter tuning e.g. in  [[connectionist]] systems). Learning is based on [[empirical]] data and is associated with non-symbolic AI, [[Scruffies|scruffy AI]] and [[soft computing]]. Methods mainly include:
*[[Neural network]]s: systems with very strong [[pattern recognition]] capabilities.
*[[Fuzzy system]]s: techniques for [[reasoning under uncertainty]], has been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems.
*[[Evolutionary computation]]: applies biologically inspired concepts such as [[population]]s, [[mutation]] and [[survival of the fittest]] to generate increasingly better solutions to the problem. These methods most notably divide into [[evolutionary algorithm]]s (e.g. [[genetic algorithm]]s) and [[swarm intelligence]] (e.g. [[ant colony optimization|ant algorithm]]s).

With [[hybrid intelligent system]]s attempts are made to combine these two groups. Expert inference rules can be generated through neural network or [[production rule]]s from statistical learning such as in [[ACT-R]].

==History==
{{main|History of artificial intelligence}}

Early in the 17th century, [[René Descartes]] proposed that bodies of animals are nothing more than complex machines. [[Blaise Pascal]] created the first mechanical digital calculating machine in [[1642]]. In the 19th century, [[Charles Babbage]] and [[Ada Lovelace]] worked on programmable mechanical calculating machines.

[[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] published ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', which revolutionized formal logic. [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]] published &quot;A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity&quot; in [[1943]] laying foundations for [[neural network]]s.

The 1950s were a period of active efforts in AI.  The first working AI programs were written in 1951 to run on the Ferranti Mark I machine of the University of Manchester (UK):  a draughts-playing program written by Christopher Strachey and a chess-playing program written by Dietrich Prinz.  [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] coined the term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; in the first conference devoted to the subject, in 1956. He also invented the [[Lisp programming language]]. [[Alan Turing]] introduced the &quot;[[Turing test]]&quot; as a way of operationalizing a test of intelligent behavior. [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] built [[ELIZA]], a [[chatterbot]] implementing [[Rogerian psychotherapy]].

During the 1960s and 1970s, [[Joel Moses]] demonstrated the power of symbolic reasoning for integration problems in the Macsyma program, the first successful knowledge-based program in mathematics. [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] publish ''Perceptrons'', demonstrating limits of simple neural nets and [[Alain Colmerauer]] developed the [[Prolog]] computer language. [[Ted Shortliffe]] demonstrated the power of rule-based systems for [[knowledge representation]] and inference in medical diagnosis and therapy in what is sometimes called the first expert system. [[Hans Moravec]] developed the first computer-controlled vehicle to [[autonomous vehicle|autonomously]] negotiate cluttered obstacle courses.

In the 1980s, neural networks became widely used with the [[backpropagation]] algorithm, first described by [[Paul John Werbos]] in [[1974]]. The 1990s marked major achievements in many areas of AI and demonstrations of various applications. Most notably [[Deep Blue]], a chess-playing computer, beat [[Garry Kasparov]] in a famous six-game match in 1997. [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] stated that the costs saved by implementing AI methods for scheduling units in the first [[Gulf War]] have repaid the US government's entire investment in AI research since the 1950s.

==Philosophy==
{{portalpar|Mind and Brain}}
''Main article: [[Philosophy of artificial intelligence]]''

The [[strong AI]] vs. weak AI debate is still a hot topic amongst AI [[philosopher]]s. This involves [[philosophy of mind]] and the [[mind-body problem]]. Most notably [[Roger Penrose]] in his book ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]'' and [[John Searle]] with his &quot;[[Chinese room]]&quot; [[thought experiment]] argue that true [[consciousness]] can not be achieved by [[formal logic]] systems, while [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' and [[Daniel Dennett]] in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' argue in favour of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalism]]. In many strong AI supporters’ opinion, [[artificial consciousness]] is considered as the [[list of holy grails|holy grail]] of artificial intelligence.

==Science fiction==
In [[science fiction]] AI is commonly portrayed as an upcoming power trying to overthrow human authority as in [[HAL 9000]], [[Skynet]], [[Colossus: The Forbin Project|Colossus]] and [[The Matrix]] or as service [[humanoid]]s like [[C-3PO]], [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], the [[Bicentennial Man]], the ''Mechas'' in [[A.I. (film)|A.I.]] or Sonny in [[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]].
&lt;!--this is not a list of your favorite sci-fi AI, keep it short and use only famous and clear examples--&gt;

The inevitability of AI world domination, sometimes called &quot;[[Technological singularity|the Singularity]]&quot;, is also argued by some science writers like [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Vernor Vinge]] and [[Kevin Warwick]]. In works such as the Japanese [[manga]] ''[[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', the existence of intelligent machines questions the definition of life as organisms rather than a broader category of autonomous entities, establishing a notional concept of systemic intelligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Afro Celt Sound System''' is a [[band (music)|musical group]] which fuses modern [[dance music|dance]] rhythms ([[trip-hop]], [[techno music|techno]], etc.) with [[Celtic music|Celtic]] and [[Africa]]n influences. It was formed by [[Grammy]]-nominated producer-guitarist [[Simon Emmerson]], and is considered to be somewhat of a [[world music]] [[supergroup (bands)|supergroup]], often having a wide range of guest artists on their albums. 

Their albums have been released through [[Peter Gabriel]]'s [[Real World Records]], and they are also reportedly the best-selling band on the label, only exceeded in sales by Gabriel himself, and their striking live performances have often become the highlights of the [[WOMAD]] concert festivals. They signed a contract with Real World obliged to release five albums, of which the 2005 release ''Anatomic'' is the last; at this writing it is unclear what path the band will take in the future.

In 2003 they changed their name to the simpler '''Afro Celts'''; however, two of their latest albums, ''Pod'', a compilation of new mixes of songs from the first four albums, and their fifth studio album ''Anatomic'' uses the long and familiar form. This decision is apparently affected by the fact that they seem much more well-known as ''Afro Celt Sound System'' around the world.

==Band members==
When Afro Celts began their musical journey in the mid-1990s during the [[Real World Records|Real World]] Recording Week the difference between a guest artist and a band member was virtually non-existent, though as time has passed a following combination of people is most often associated with the name Afro Celt Sound System: ''(Please note that the new release Anatomic only lists Simon, James, Iarla and Martin as regulars)''

# [[Simon Emmerson]] (guitar, producing)
# [[N'Faly Kouyate]] ([[kora (instrument)|kora]], [[balaphon]], [[n'goma]], vocals)
# [[Moussa Sissokho]] ([[djembe]], [[talking drum]])
# [[James McNally (musician)|James McNally]] (ex-[[Pogues]]; [[Bodhrán]], [[accordion]], [[Tin whistle|whistle]])
# [[Johnny Kalsi]] (the [[Dhol drum]])
# [[Iarla Ó Lionáird]] (vocals)
# [[Emer Maycock]] ([[tin whistle]], [[flute]], [[uillean pipes]])
# [[Martin Russell]] (keyboards, producing, engineering, programming)

==Vedic philosophy==

In the east, Indian philosophy begins with the [[Vedas]] where questions related to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. In the famous [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] ''Hymn of Creation'' the poet says:

&quot;Whence all creation had its origin,
he, whether he fashioned it or whether he did not,
he, who surveys it all from highest heaven,
he knows--or maybe even he does not know.&quot;

In the [[Vedic religion|Vedic]] view, creation is ascribed to the self-consciousness of the primeval being (''Purusha''). This leads to the inquiry into ''the one being'' that underlies the diversity of empirical phenomena and the origin of all things.  Cosmic order is termed ''rta'' and causal law by ''karma''. Nature (''prakriti'') is taken to have three qualities (''[[sattva]]'', ''[[rajas]]'', and ''[[tamas]]'').

*[[Vedas]] 
*[[Upanishads]]
*[[Hinduism]]

==Classical Indian philosophy==

In classical times, these inquiries were systematized in six schools of philosophy. The questions asked were:

*What is the ontological nature of consciousness?
*How is cognition itself experienced?
*Is mind (''chit'') intentional or not?
*Does cognition have its own structure?

The six schools of [[Indian philosophy]] are:

*[[Mimamsa]]
*[[Samkhya]]
*[[Yoga]]
*[[Vaisheshika]]
*[[Nyaya]]
*[[Vedanta]]

==Old Iranian philosophy==

While there are ancient relations between the Indian [[Vedas]] and the Iranian [[Avesta]], the two main families of the Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view on the role of man in the universe. The first charter of [[human rights]] by [[Cyrus the Great]] is widely seen as a reflection of the questions and thoughts expressed by [[Zarathustra]] and developed in zoroastrian schools of thought.

*[[Avesta]]
*[[Gathas]]
*[[Zarathustra]]
*[[Zoroastrianism]]
*[[Mazdakism]]
*[[Manichaeism]]

==Chinese philosophy==

In China, less emphasis was put upon materialism as a basis for reflecting upon the world and more on conduct, manners and social behaviour, as evidenced by [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]].

*[[Chinese philosophy]] -- [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]]
*[[Buddhist philosophy]] arose in India but contributions to it were made in [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[Korea]] also.
*[[Eastern philosophy]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Anaximander.jpg|thumb|right|Anaximander|200px]]
'''Anaximander''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: '''&amp;#913;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#958;&amp;#943;&amp;#956;&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#948;&amp;#961;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;''')(c.610 BC&amp;ndash;c. [[546 BC]]) also known as '''Aniximander''', was the second of the physical philosophers of [[Ionia]], a citizen of [[Miletus]], a companion or pupil of [[Thales]], and teacher of [[Anaximenes of Miletus]].  Little is known of his life and work.  [[Aelian]] makes him the leader of the Milesian colony to [[Amphipolis]], and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent citizen. The computations of [[Apollodorus of Athens]] have fixed his birth in 611, and his death shortly after 547 B.C.

Ancient sources represent him as a successful student of [[astronomy]] and [[geography]], and an early proponent of [[exact science]].  He has also been said to have introduced such astronomical instruments as the [[sundial]] and the [[gnomon]] to ancient [[Greece]].  Furthermore, he is credited with having  created the first map of the world, which was circular in form and showed the known lands of the world grouped around the Aegean Sea at the center and all of this was surrounded by the ocean.

==Cosmology and the ''apeiron''==
Anaximander's reputation is due mainly to a cosmological work, little of which remains.  From the few extant fragments, we learn that he believed the beginning or first principle (''[[arche]],'' a word first found in Anaximander's writings, and which he probably invented) is an endless, unlimited mass ([[apeiron]]), subject to neither old age nor decay, which perpetually yields fresh materials from which everything we can perceive is derived. 

He never defined this principle precisely, and it has generally (e.g. by [[Aristotle]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]) been understood as a sort of primal [[Chaos_(mythology)|chaos]].  It embraced the opposites of hot and cold, wet and dry, and directed the movement of things, by which there grew up all of the host of shapes and differences which are found in &quot;all the worlds&quot;--as he believed there were many.   

Out of the vague and limitless body there sprang a central mass &amp;mdash; this earth of ours, cylindrical in shape, poised equidistant from surrounding orbs of fire, which had originally clung to it like the bark round a tree, until their continuity was severed, and they parted into several wheel-shaped and fire-filled bubbles of air.

Man himself and the animals had come into being by like transmutations. Mankind was supposed by Anaximander to have sprung from some other species of animals, probably aquatic. For, he thought, man with his extended infancy could not have survived, originally, in the manner he does presently. For this, even though he had no theory of [[natural selection]], some people consider him to be [[evolution]]ary theory's most ancient proponent.

Anaximander offered up the theory of the apeiron in direct response to the earlier theory of his teacher, [[Thales]], who had claimed that the primary substance was [[water]].  Anaximander reasoned that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature &amp;mdash; for example, water can only be wet, never dry &amp;mdash; and therefore, it can not  be the one primary substance.  Nor could any of the other candidates, so Anaximander postulated the [[apeiron]] as a substance that, although it could not be perceived directly, could explain the opposites he could clearly see around him.


----
The one surviving fragment of Anaximander was transmitted as a quote by [[Simplicius_of_Cilicia|Simplicius]] and could be translated as
&lt;h3 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Whence things have their origin,&lt;br&gt;
Thence also their destruction happens, &lt;br&gt;
As is the order of things; &lt;br&gt;
For they execute the sentence upon one another&lt;br&gt;
- The condemnation for the crime -&lt;br&gt;
In conformity with the ordinance of Time. &lt;/h3&gt;

== Interpretations ==
[[Bertrand Russell]] in ''The History of Western Philosophy'' interprets the above quote as an assertion of the necessity of an appropriate balance between earth, fire, and water elements, all of which may be independently seeking to aggrandize their proportions relative to the others. Anaximander seems to express his belief that a natural order ensures balance between these elements, that where there was fire, ashes (earth) now exist. Anaximander's Greek peers echoed this sentiment with their belief of natural boundaries that not even their Gods could operate beyond.


[[Nietzsche]], in his ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist. Anaximander asserted that the primal being of the world was state of indefiniteness. In accordance with this, anything definite has to eventually pass back into indefiniteness. In other words, Anaximander viewed &quot;...all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance.&quot; (''Ibid.'', § 4) The world of individual objects, in this way of thinking, has no worth and should perish.

[[Image:Architect.png|thumb|Architect at his drawing board, 1893]]

An '''architect''' is a person involved in the [[planning]], [[Design|designing]] and oversight of a [[Building|building's]] [[construction]]. The most basic definition of an architect is a professional who is qualified to design and provide advice - functional, aesthetic and technical - on built objects in our public and private landscapes.  More generally, an architect is the designer of a scheme or plan.

&quot;Architect&quot; is derived from Latin: ''architectus'', and from Greek: ''arkhitekton'' (master builder), ''arkhi'' (chief) + ''tekton'' (builder, carpenter). [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=architect&amp;searchmode=none]

In the broadest sense, an '''architect''' is a person who interfaces between the end user of a planned structure and the [[builder]].  That is, the architect translates the user's needs into the builder's requirements.  The architect must be completely conversant with the user's environment, that is, the area of business or industry for which the structure is to be used, so that s/he can fully and completely understand the image of the final result that the user is trying to convey.  Equally as important, the architect must thoroughly understand the building and operational codes with which the builder must conform and, upon completion, during use of the structure. That degree of knowledge is necessary so that s/he is not apt to omit any necessary requirements, or produce improper, conflicting, ambiguous, or confusing requirements. S/he must understand the various methods available to the builder for building the user's structure, so that s/he can negotiate with the user to produce a best possible compromise of the results desired within explicit cost and time boundaries.
                                        
Architects are professionals considered on par with doctors, engineers, and lawyers, and they must frequently make building design and planning decisions that affect the safety and well being of the general public. Architects are required to obtain specialized education and documented work experience to obtain professional licensure, similar to the requirements for other [[professional]]s, with requirements for practice varying greatly from place to place (see below).

The most prestigious award a living architect can receive is the [[Pritzker Prize]].  It is considered the equivalent of the [[Nobel Prize]] for [[architecture]].  Other awards for excellence in architecture are given by national and regional professional associations such as the [[American Institute of Architects]] and [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].
  
&lt;!--If you would like to describe someone who is not an architect, please consider adding another entry (or at least creating another paragraph).  This one is intended to define the professional term Architect, which has a legal definition in most areas.--&gt;

&lt;!--This is not a legal dictionary--&gt;

Although '''architect''' may be a specific term referring to a licensed professional, the word is frequently used in the broader sense noted above to define someone who brings order to the built or unbuilt environment through the use of rational constructs using (engineering) design tools. ['''Note:''' someone who brings order to the built and/or unbuilt environment through the use of rational '''or irrational''' constructs and '''who may or may not use''' design tools is normally referred to as an [[artist]]. Although structures described by [[architectures]] may often be said to contain [[artistic]] features, as a whole they are rarely referred to as works of [[art]].  Similarly, works of [[art]] are rarely referred to as having an [[architecture]].]

For example, '''naval architects, software architects,''' etc., and graduates of schools of architecture not doing regulated project/construction documents are often called '''architects.'''  However, '''non-licensed architects''' and designers working in the [[construction industry]] are prohibited from referring to themselves as '''architects''' in most countries. 

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], architects are required to belong to provincial architectural associations that require them to complete an accredited degree in architecture, finish a multi-year internship process, pass a series of exams, and pay an annual fee to acquire and maintain a license to practice. 

The [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] [http://www.raic.org/] aims to be &quot;the voice of Architecture and its practice in Canada.&quot; Architects who are members of this organization are permitted to use the suffix MRAIC after their names. All members of the RAIC hold accredited degrees in architecture, but not all Canadian architects are members of the RAIC.

==UK==

Architects in the [[UK]] qualify through courses and exams recognized by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) and prescribed by the [[Architects_Registration_Board|Architects Registration Board]] (ARB). 

Typically the sequence of education leading to full [[professional certification|qualification]] and registration takes seven years and is:

* Three-year degree course
* RIBA Part 1 exam
* One year’s professional experience
* Further two-year course
* RIBA Part 2 exam
* Another year’s professional experience
* RIBA Part 3 exam

The title ‘architect’ has legal protection in the United Kingdom; under the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1997/97022--f.htm#20 Architects Act 1997] it is against the law for people who are not registered to practise or carry on business under any name, style or title that contains the word. 

However, [[draughtsmen]] and [[architectural technologists]] (previously architectural technicians), as well as many who have chosen not to register, may also provide architectural services.

==USA==
In the [[United States]], people wishing to become licensed architects (interns) are required to have a degree from a school accredited by the [[#External Links|NAAB]] and pass a series of exams administered by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB), referred to as the [[Architect Registration Exam]]ination (the ARE).  In addition, interns must have a minimum of 3 years of documented, practical work experience (quantity depends on type of educational experience and type of educational degree earned) working under a licensed Architect before they may become eligible to take the ARE.  Although the ARE is a national exam, each state has specific requirements and issues their own licenses (including California and Hawaii), due to varying environmental conditions in each region. Other states have reciprocity agreements, so licenses may be easily transferred between certain states. Schooling is not always required in such states as New York, for someone who works at least 10 years under an accredited architect is eligible for a licensing test. 

There are three types of accredited (&quot;professional&quot;) degrees in architecture in the United States; a Bachelor of Architecture, a Master of Architecture, or a Doctor of Architecture (abbreviated as B.Arch., M.Arch., and D.Arch., respectively).  These are called professional degrees as they are required to enter the profession. A Bachelor of Arts in Architecture (BA), Bachelor of Fine Arts in Architecture (BFA Arch), Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BS), or Bachelor of Environmental Design (B.Envd) typically takes four years - as opposed to five for a B. Arch degree - and is considered a pre-professional degree. However a professional degree may still be required  (to take the ARE and to practice) and the programs are often combined usually leading to an M.Arch degree.  A pre-professional degree is not necessary to enter a professional degree program, but accelerates completion. It is possible to become licensed as an Architect in other ways: reciprical licensure for over-seas architects and working under an architect as an intern for an extended period of time. Following graduation from a professional program, documented apprenticeship (typically 3 year internship) is required before the individual is eligible to take the ARE and become licensed.   

The [[American Institute of Architects]] [http://www.aia.org] is a professional organization dedicated to offering a network of services to architects in the United States.  Architects who are members of this organization are permitted to use the suffix AIA after their names.  All architects who are licensed by their respective states have professional status as Registered Architects (RA), which is the suffix used if the architect is not also a member of the AIA.

==Hong Kong==
In [[Hong Kong]] to be an architect, one must be a graduate of a university specified by the HKIA plus a two year internship, then take the architect registration examination. Architects from U.K. and U.S.A. with 10 years experience aren't required to take the examination, but are required to attend an interview just as a formality.

Architects in Hong Kong are not authorized to submit building plans but use it as a 'title' only, unlike in most of the western world which carries a statutory obligation. To be able to submit building plans, architects, engineers or surveyors must go through another step by passing an authorized personal interview. Contrary to popular thought, most of the famous buildings in Hong Kong are designed by well-known international 'brand' architects and local architects act only as facilitators.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]] the title architect is legally protected and architects are registered through state boards. These boards are affiliated through the [http://www.aaca.org.au/index.html Architects Accreditation Council of Australia]. The AACA also provides accrediation for schools and assessments for architects with overseas qualifications for the purposes of migration.

There are three key requirements for registration. The first is a professional degree from a school of architecture accredited by the AACA. This is generally a Bachelor of Architecture degree of five or six years duration. The second is at least two years of practical experience and the third is the completion of the architectural practice examination.

Architects may also belong to the [http://www.architecture.com.au Royal Australian Institute of Architects] which is the professional organisation and members use the suffix RAIA after their name.

'''Abbreviation''' (from [[Latin]] ''brevis'' &quot;short&quot;) is strictly a shorter form of a word, but more particularly, an ''abbreviation'' is a letter or group of letters, taken from a word or words, and employed to represent them for the sake of brevity. For example, the word &quot;abbreviation&quot; can be abbreviated as &quot;abbr.&quot; or &quot;abbrev.&quot;

== Types of abbreviations ==

Apart from the common form of shortening one word, there are other types of abbreviations. These include [[acronym and initialism]] (including [[TLA]]),
[[apocopation]] (that is, apocope), [[clipping (phonetics)]], [[elision]], [[syncope]], syllabic abbreviation, [[portmanteau]].

=== Syllabic abbreviation ===
A syllabic abbreviation (SA) is an abbreviation formed from (usually) initial [[syllable]]s of several [[Word (linguistics)|word]]s, such as ''[[Interpol]]'' for '''''Inter'''national '''pol'''ice''.

SAs are usually written in [[lower case]], sometimes starting with a [[capital letter]], and are always [[pronunciation|pronounced]] as words rather than letter by letter.

SAs should be distinguished from [[portmanteau]]x.

==== Use in different languages ====

Syllabic abbreviations are not widely used in [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]], but are common in [[German language|German]].

They prevailed in [[Nazi Germany|Germany under the Nazis]] and in the [[Soviet Union]] for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organizations. For example, ''[[Gestapo]]'' stands for '''''Ge'''heime '''Sta'''ats-'''Po'''lizei'', or &quot;secret state police&quot;. This has given SAs a negative connotation, even though SAs were used in Germany before the Nazis, e.g., ''[[:de:Schupo|Schupo]]'' for ''Schutzpolizei''. Even now Germans call part of their police ''[[Kripo]]'' for ''Kriminalpolizei''.  SAs were also typical of German language used in the [[German Democratic Republic]], e.g. ''[[Stasi]]'' for ''Staatssicherheit'' (&quot;state security&quot;, the secret police) or ''Vopo'' for ''Volkspolizist'' (&quot;people's policeman&quot;).

[[East Asia]]n languages whose writing uses [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-originated [[ideogram]]s instead of an alphabet form abbreviations similarly by using key [[Chinese character|character]]s from a term or phrase.  For example, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] the term for the [[United Nations]], ''kokusai reng&amp;#333;'' (&amp;#22269;&amp;#38555;&amp;#36899;&amp;#21512;) is often abbreviated to ''kokuren'' (&amp;#22269;&amp;#36899;). Another classic example is ''[[shogun]]''. Such abbreviations are called [[:ja:&amp;#30053;&amp;#35486;|ryakugo]] (&amp;#30053;&amp;#35486;) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. SAs are frequently used for names of universities: for instance, ''Beida'' (北大, Běidà) for [[Peking University]] ([[Beijing]]) and '''Tōdai'' (東大) for the [[University of Tokyo]].

==== Usage of syllabic abbreviations in organisations ====

Syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the US [[Navy]] as it increases readability amidst the large number of [[initialism]]s that would otherwise have to fit into the same [[acronym]]s. Hence ''[[DESRON]] 6'' is used (in the full capital form) to mean &quot;Destroyer Squadron 6,&quot; while ''[[COMNAVFORLANT]]'' would be &quot;Commander, Naval Force (in the) Atlantic.&quot;

==Style conventions==
In [[modern English]] there are several conventions for abbreviations and the choice may be confusing. The only rule universally accepted is that one should be ''consistent,'' and to this end publishers express their preferences in a [[style guide]].

Questions which arise include the following:
* Use of upper or lower case letters.  If the original word was capitalised, then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital, for example Lev. for Leviticus.  When abbreviating words spelled with lower case letters, there is no consistent rule. 
* Use of periods (full stops) and spaces, for example when abbreviating United States, should one write &quot;US&quot;, &quot;U.S.&quot; or &quot;U.&amp;nbsp;S.&quot;?   Spaces are generally not used between single letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase, so one almost never encounters &quot;U.&amp;nbsp;S.&quot;. In [[American English]], the period is usually added if the abbreviation may be interpreted as a word, though some American writers do not use a period here.  There is no stop/period between letters of the same word, for example St. and not S.t. for Saint. While users of [[British English]] often abbreviate in the same manner, it is more common in formal writing that abbreviations are written with full stops if the word has been cut at the point of abbreviation (''e.g.,'' &quot;Street&quot; &amp;ndash; &quot;St[reet]&quot; &amp;ndash; becomes &quot;St.&quot;), but not otherwise (''e.g.,'' &quot;Saint&quot; &amp;ndash; &quot;S[ain]t&quot; &amp;ndash; becomes &quot;St&quot;); a third standard removes the full stops from all abbreviations (''e.g.,'' both &quot;Saint&quot; and &quot;Street&quot; become &quot;St&quot;).  Thus in the [[United Kingdom]], titles such as &quot;Doctor&quot;, &quot;Mister&quot; and &quot;Mis'ess&quot; are commonly abbreviated as &quot;Dr&quot;, &quot;Mr&quot;, and &quot;Mrs&quot; respectively, they are also frequently written, as in Canada and the U.S., as &quot;Dr.&quot;, &quot;Mr.&quot; and &quot;Mrs.&quot; &lt;!--British English does not have a single standard. See [[American and British English differences]]--&gt; 
* [[Acronym]]s that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since &quot;stood the test of time&quot; by entering the vocabulary as generic words are no longer abbreviated with capital letters nor with any periods&amp;mdash;''e.g.,'' [[sonar]], [[radar]], [[ladar]], [[laser]], and [[scuba]].
* Whether to add an apostrophe for a plural where the plural is not formed by doubling up the last letter: should one write CDs or CD's?  The apostrophe is not needed grammatically but sometimes is added to make it clear that the ''s'' is not part of the abbreviation.  Because the apostrophe most often represents possession or a contraction, some style guides prefer that it not be used at all with abbreviations, but only with individual ''letters''&amp;mdash;&quot;Dot all your i's and cross all your t's!&quot; or &quot;Mind your p's and q's!&quot;&amp;mdash;or ''numbers''&amp;mdash;&quot;The dyslexic student mixes up his S's and 5's.&quot;  Thus numbers, such as decades, that are understood to ''represent'' other concepts, are not written with apostrophes either&amp;mdash;''e.g.,'' &quot;The U.S. enjoyed an economic boom in the 1990s and the Roaring ’20s&quot;, referring to decades, or &quot;I am going to the bank to exchange four 5's for two 10's&quot;, where the 5's and 10's refer to banknotes.

Conventions followed by publications and newspapers:
* Publications based in the United States tend to follow the style guides of the [[Chicago Manual of Style]] and the [[Associated Press]].  The [[U.S. Government]] follows a style guide published by the [[U.S. Government Printing Office]].
** There is some inconsistency in abbreviation styles, however, as they are not rigorously defined by style guides. Some two-word abbreviations, like &quot;United Nations&quot;, are abbreviated with uppercase letters and periods, and others, like &quot;personal computer&quot; (PC) and &quot;compact disc&quot; (CD), are not; rather, they are typically abbreviated without periods and in uppercase letters. A third variation is to use lowercase letters with periods; this is used by Time Magazine in abbreviating &quot;public relations&quot; (p.r.). Moreover, even three-word abbreviations (most U.S. publications use uppercase abbreviations without periods) are sometimes not consistently abbreviated, even within the same article. 
** ''[[The New York Times]]'' is unique in having a consistent style by always abbreviating with periods: P.C., I.B.M., P.R. This is in contrast with the trend of British publications to completely make do without periods for convenience.   

* Many British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:
** For the sake of convenience, many British publications, including the [[BBC]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'', have completely done away with the use of full stops or periods in all abbreviations. These include:
*** Social titles, like Ms or Mr (though these would not have had full stops in any case &amp;mdash; see above) Capt, Prof, ''etc.;''
*** Two-letter abbreviations for countries (US, not U.S.);
*** Words are seldom abbreviated with lower case letters (PR, instead of p.r., or pr) 
*** Abbreviations beyond three letters (full caps for all except initialisms); 
*** Names (''e.g.,'' FW de Klerk, GB Whiteley, Park JS). A notable exception is the ''Economist'' (''e.g.,'' Mr F. W. de Klerk) 
*** Scientific units. 
** [[Acronym]]s are referred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalised. For instance, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] can be abbreviated as Nato, and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] as Sars. [[Initialism]]s (which are similar to acronyms but which are not pronounced as words) are always written in capitals, for instance the British Broadcasting Corporation is abbreviated to BBC, never Bbc.
** When abbreviating scientific units, no space is added between the number and unit (''e.g.,'' 100mph, 100m, 10cm, 10ºC). 

Miscellaneous and general rules
* Plurals are often formed by doubling up the last letter of the abbreviation. Most of these deal with writing and publishing: MS=manuscript, MSS=manuscripts; l=line, ll=lines; p=page, pp=pages; s=section, ss=sections; op.=opus, opp.=opera). This form, derived from [[Latin]] is used in Europe in many places:  dd=[[didot]]s. &quot;The following (lines or pages)&quot; is denoted by ff. One example that does not concern printing is hh=[[hand (unit)|hand]]s. 
* A doubled letter also appears in abbreviations of some Welsh names, as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the double &quot;l&quot; is a separate sound: &quot;Ll. George&quot; for (British prime minister) [[Lloyd George]]. 
* Some titles, such as &quot;Reverend&quot; and &quot;Honourable&quot;, are spelt out when preceded by &quot;the&quot;, rather than as &quot;Rev.&quot; or &quot;Hon.&quot; respectively. This is true for most British publications, and some in the United States.
* It is usually advised to spell out the abbreviation where it is new or unfamiliar to the reader (''e.g.,'' UNESCO in a magazine about ''music,'' because it more frequently refers to another entity in another context, the &lt;u&gt;U&lt;/u&gt;nited &lt;u&gt;N&lt;/u&gt;ations &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;ducational, &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;cientific and &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;ultural &lt;u&gt;O&lt;/u&gt;rganization).

==History== 
After [[World War II]], the British greatly reduced their use of the full stop and other punctuations after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing, while the Americans more readily kept its use until more recently, and still maintain it more than Britons. The classic example, considered by their American counterparts quite curious, was the maintenance of the internal comma in a British organization of secret agents called the &quot;Special Operations, Executive&quot; &amp;ndash; &quot;S.O.,E.&quot; &amp;ndash; which is not found in histories written after about 1960.  

But before that, many Britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the French form. In [[French language|French]], the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is ''not'' the last letter of its antecedent:  &quot;M.&quot; is the abbreviation for &quot;''monsieur''&quot; while &quot;Mme&quot; is that for &quot;''Madame''&quot; and &quot;Mlle&quot; for &quot;''Mademoiselle''&quot;. Like many other cross-[[English Channel|channel]] linguistic acquisitions, many Britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves, while the Americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously.

Over the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. The U.S. media tend to abbreviate two-word abbreviations like United States (U.S.), but surprisingly, not personal computer (PC) or television (TV), which is a source of confusion. Many British publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations completely.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the branch of mathematics. For other uses of the term &quot;algebra&quot; see [[algebra (disambiguation)]].''

'''Abstract algebra''' is the field of [[mathematics]] concerned with the study of [[algebraic structure]]s such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]], [[vector space]]s, and [[algebra over a field|algebras]]. Many of these structures were defined formally in the nineteenth century, and, indeed, the study of abstract algebra was motivated by the need for more rigor in mathematics.  The study of abstract algebra has brought into full view intricacies of the logical assumptions on which the whole of mathematics and the natural sciences are built, and today there is scarcely a branch of mathematics which doesn't utilize the results of algebra.  What's more, in the course of study, algebraists discovered that apparently diverse logical structures can very often be brought by analogy to a very small core of axioms.  This grants the mathematician who has learned algebra a deep sight, and empowers him broadly.

The term ''abstract algebra'' is used to distinguish the field from &quot;[[elementary algebra]]&quot; or &quot;high school algebra&quot;, which teach the correct rules for manipulating formulas and algebraic expressions involving [[real numbers|real]] and [[complex number]]s, and [[unknown]]s. Abstract algebra was at times in the first half of the [[twentieth century]] known as '''modern algebra'''.

The term '''abstract algebra''' is sometimes used in [[universal algebra]] where most authors use simply the term &quot;algebra&quot;. 

== History and examples ==

Historically, algebraic structures usually arose first in some other field of mathematics, were specified axiomatically, and were then studied in their own right in abstract algebra. Because of this, abstract algebra has numerous fruitful connections to all other branches of mathematics.

Examples of algebraic structures with a single [[binary operation]] are:

* [[magma (algebra)|magmas]],
* [[quasigroup]]s,
* [[monoid]]s, [[semigroup]]s and, most important, [[group (mathematics)|groups]].

More complicated examples include:

* [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]
* [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[vector space]]s
* [[algebra over a field|algebras over fields]]
* [[associative algebra]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s
* [[lattice (order)|lattice]]s and [[Boolean algebra]]s

In [[universal algebra]], all those definitions and facts are collected that apply to all algebraic structures alike. All the above classes of objects, together with the proper notion of [[homomorphism]], form [[category theory|categories]], and category theory frequently provides the formalism for translating between and comparing different algebraic structures.

==An example==
The systematic study of algebra has allowed mathematicians to bring under a common logical description apparently disparate conceptions.  For example, consider two rather distinct operations: the composition of [[function composition|functions]], f(g(x)), and the multiplication of [[matrix multiplication|matrices]], AB.  These two operations are, in fact, the same.  To see this, think about multiplying two square matrices (AB) by a one-column vector, x.  This, in fact, defines a function that is equivalent to composing Ay with Bx:  Ay = A(Bx) = (AB)x.  Functions under composition and matrices under multiplication form sets called [[monoid]]s; a monoid under an operation is associative for all its elements ( (ab)c = a(bc) ) and contains an element e such that, for any a, ae = ea = a.

{{otheruses}}
'''Aphrodite''' ([[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (pronunciation)/IPA vs. other pronunciation symbols#Chart|World Book]] ''«AF roh DY tee»'') ( {{unicode|&amp;#x1F08;}}&amp;#966;&amp;#961;&amp;#959;&amp;#948;&amp;#943;&amp;#964;&amp;#951;, &quot;risen from sea-foam&quot;) is the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]] of [[love]] and [[beauty]].

== Worship ==
{{Greek myth (Olympian)}}
The epithet ''Aphrodite Acidalia'' was occasionally added to her name, after the spring she used to bathe in, located in [[Boeotia]] ([[Virgil]] I, 720).  She was also called ''Kypris'' or ''Cytherea'' after her alleged birth-places in [[Cyprus]] and [[Cythera]], respectively.  The island of Cythera was a center of her cult.  She was associated with [[Hesperia]] and frequently accompanied by the [[Oread]]s, [[nymph]]s of the mountains.

Aphrodite had a festival of her own, the Aphrodisiac, which was celebrated all over Greece but particularly in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]] and [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]].  In Corinth, intercourse with her priestesses was considered a method of worshipping Aphrodite.

Aphrodite was associated with, and often depicted with [[dolphin]]s, [[dove]]s, [[swan]]s, [[pomegranate]]s,[[apples]], [[myrtle]], [[rose]] and [[Lime (Citrus aurantifolia)|lime]] trees.

Her Roman analogue is [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].  Her [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] counterpart was [[Ishtar]]. Her Egyptian counterpart is [[Hathor]], and her Syro-Palestinian counterpart was [[`Ashtart|&amp;#8216;Ashtart]] (in standard Greek spelling ''Astarte''); her [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] equivalent was [[Turan (mythology)|Turan]].

Venus was often referred to with epithet [[Venus Erycina]] (&quot;of the heather&quot;) after [[Mount Eryx]], [[Sicily]], one of the centers of her cult.

== Birth ==

[[Image:Bouguereau venus detail.jpg|115px|thumb|right|Aphrodite rising from the sea foam in birth, crowned with luxuriant tresses, as depicted in the [[19th century]] by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] in his [[1879]] ''Birth of Venus'' (the [[Rome|Roman]] name for Aphrodite).]]

&quot;Foam-arisen&quot; Aphrodite was born of the sea foam near [[Paphos]], Cyprus after [[Cronus]] cut off [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]' genitals and Cronus threw the penis into the sea. [[Hesiod's Theogony]] described that the genitals &quot;were carried over the sea a long time, and white foam arose from the immortal flesh; with a girl grew&quot; to become Aphrodite.  Thus Aphrodite is of an older generation than Zeus. ''[[Iliad]]'' (Book V) expresses another version of her origin, by which she was considered a daughter of [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]], who was the original oracular goddess (&quot;Dione&quot; being simply &quot;the goddess,&quot; etymologically an equivalent of &quot;[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]&quot;) at [[Dodona]]. In Homer, Aphrodite, venturing into battle to protect her son, [[Aeneas]], who has been wounded by [[Diomedes]] and returns to her mother, to sink down at her knee and be comforted.  &quot;Dione&quot; seems to be an equivalent of Rhea, the [[Earth Mother]], whom Homer has relocated to Olympus. After this story, Aphrodite herself was sometimes referred to as &quot;Dione&quot;. Once [[Zeus]] had usurped the oak-grove oracle at Dodona, some poets made him out to be the father of Aphrodite.

Aphrodite's chief center of worship remained at Paphos, on the south-western coast of Cyprus, where the goddess of desire had long been worshipped as [[Ishtar]] and [[Ashtaroth]].  It is said that she first tentatively came ashore at [[Cytherea]], a stopping place for trade and culture between [[Crete]] and the [[Peloponnese|Peloponesus]].  Thus perhaps we have hints of the track of Aphrodite's original cult from the [[Levant]] to mainland [[Greece]]. 

In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium]]'' the speech of Pausanias distinguishes two manifestations of Aphrodite, represented by the two stories: Aphrodite Ourania (&quot;heavenly&quot; Aphrodite), and Aphrodite Pandemos (&quot;Common&quot; Aphrodite). These two manifestations represented her role in homosexuality and heterosexuality, respectively. 

Alternatively, Aphrodite was a daughter of [[Thalassa]] (for she was born of the Sea) and [[Zeus]].

== Adulthood ==
Aphrodite, in many of the myths involving her, is characterized as vain, ill-tempered and easily offended. Though she is one of the few gods of the [[List of Greek mythological characters|Greek Pantheon]] to be actually married, she is frequently unfaithful to her husband. [[Hephaestus]], of course, is one of the most even-tempered of the Hellenic deities; Aphrodite seems to prefer [[Ares]], the volatile god of war. In [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] she surges into battle to save her son, but abandons him (in fact, drops him as she flies through the air) when she herself is hurt (Ares does much the same thing&lt;!-- I doubt this tidbit, originally included really happened: , and [[Zeus]] eventually sends him to his room without supper --&gt;). And she is the original cause of the [[Trojan War]] itself: not only did she start the whole affair by offering [[Helen]] of [[Troy]] to [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], but the abduction was accomplished when Paris, seeing Helen for the first time, was inflamed with desire to have her&amp;mdash;which is Aphrodite's realm.  Her domain may involve love, but it does not involve [[Romantic_love|romance]]; rather, it tends more towards [[lust]], the human irrational longing.

=== Marriage with Hephaestus ===
Due to her immense beauty, Zeus was frightened she'd be the cause of violence between the other gods. He married her off to [[Hephaestus]], the dour, humorless god of smithing. Hephaestus was overjoyed at being married to the goddess of beauty and forged her beautiful jewelry, including the cestus, a [[girdle]] that made her even more irresistible to men. Her unhappiness with her marriage caused Aphrodite to seek out companionship from others, most frequently [[Ares]], but also [[Adonis]], [[Anchises]] and more. Hephaestus once cleverly caught Ares and Aphrodite in bed with finely wrought chains, and brought all the other Olympian gods together to mock the pair (however, the &quot;goddesses stayed at home, all of them for shame.&quot;) Hephaestus would not free them until [[Poseidon]] promised Hephaestus that Ares would pay reparations, but both escaped as soon as the chains were lifted and their promise was not kept.

=== Aphrodite and Psyche ===
Aphrodite was jealous of the beauty of a mortal woman named [[Psyche]]. She asked [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] to use his golden arrows to cause Psyche to fall in love with the ugliest man on earth.  Eros agreed but then fell in love with Psyche on his own, or by accidentally pricking himself with a golden arrow.  Meanwhile, Psyche's parents were anxious that their daughter remained unmarried. They consulted an [[oracle]] who told them she was destined for no mortal lover, but a monster who lived on top of a particular mountain.  Psyche was resigned to her fate and climbed to the top of the mountain. There, [[Zephyrus]], the west wind, gently floated her downwards. She entered a cave on the appointed mountain, surprised to find it full of jewellery and finery. Eros visited her every night in the cave and they made love; he demanded only that she never light any lamps because he did not want her to know who he was (having wings made him distinctive).  Her two sisters, jealous of Psyche, convinced her to do so one night and she lit a lamp, recognizing him instantly.  A drop of hot lamp oil fell on Eros' chest and he awoke, then fled.  

When Psyche told her two jealous elder sisters what had happened; they rejoiced secretly and each separately walked to the top of the mountain and did as Psyche described her entry to the cave, hoping Eros would pick them instead.  Zephyrus did not pick them and they fell to their deaths at the base of the mountain.

Psyche searched for her lover across much of Greece, finally stumbling into a temple to [[Demeter]], where the floor was covered with piles of mixed grains. She started sorting the grains into organized piles and, when she finished, Demeter spoke to her, telling her that the best way to find Eros was to find his mother, Aphrodite, and earn her blessing. Psyche found a temple to Aphrodite and entered it. Aphrodite assigned her a similar task to Demeter's temple, but gave her an impossible deadline to finish it by. Eros intervened, for he still loved her, and caused some ants to organize the grains for her. Aphrodite was outraged at her success and told her to go to a field where golden sheep grazed and get some golden wool. Psyche went to the field and saw the sheep but was stopped by a river-god, whose river she had to cross to enter the field.  He told her the sheep were mean and vicious and would kill her, but if she waited until noontime, the sheep would go the shade on the other side of the field and sleep; she could pick the wool that stuck to the branches and bark of the trees.  Psyche did so and Aphrodite was even more outraged at her survival and success. Finally, Aphrodite claimed that the stress of caring for her son, depressed and ill as a result of Psyche's unfaithfulness, had caused her to lose some of her beauty.  Psyche was to go to [[Hades]] and ask [[Persephone]], the queen of the underworld, for a bit of her beauty in a black box that Aphrodite gave to Psyche. Psyche walked to a tower, deciding that the quickest way to the underworld would be to die.  A voice stopped her at the last moment and told her a route that would allow her to enter and return still living, as well as telling her how to pass [[Cerberus]], [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] and the other dangers of the route.  She pacified Cerberus, the three-headed dog, with a sweet honey-cake and paid Charon an [[obolus]] to take her into Hades. On the way there, she saw hands reaching out of the water. A voice told her to toss a honey cake to them. Once there, Persephone said she would be glad to do do Aphrodite a favor. She once more paid Charon, threw the cake out to the hands, and gave one to Cerberus.

Psyche left the underworld and decided to open the box and take a little bit of the beauty for herself, thinking that if she did so Eros would surely love her. Inside was a &quot;[[Wiktionary:stygian|Stygian]] sleep&quot; which overtook her.  Eros, who had forgiven her, flew to her body and wiped the sleep from her eyes, then begged Zeus and Aphrodite for their consent to his wedding of Psyche. They agreed and Zeus made her immortal. Aphrodite danced at the wedding of Eros and Psyche and their subsequent child was named Pleasure, or (in the Roman mythology) [[Volupta]].

=== Adonis ===
Aphrodite was [[Adonis]]' lover and had a part in his birth. She urged [[Myrrha]] or Smyrna to commit [[incest]] with her father, [[Theias]], the King of [[Assyria]]. Another version says Myrrha's father was [[Cinyras]] of [[Cyprus]]. Myrrha's nurse helped with the scheme. When Theias discovered this, he flew into a rage, chasing his daughter with a knife. The gods turned her into a [[myrrh]] tree and Adonis eventually sprang from this tree. Alternatively, Aphrodite turned her into a tree and Adonis was born when Theias shot the tree with an arrow or when a boar used its tusks to tear the tree's bark off.

Once Adonis was born, Aphrodite took him under her wing, seducing him with the help of [[Helene (mythology)|Helene]], her friend, and was entranced by his unearthly beauty. She gave him to [[Persephone]] to watch over, but Persephone was also amazed at his beauty and refused to give him back. The argument between the two goddesses was settled either by [[Zeus]] or [[Calliope]], with Adonis spending four months with Aphrodite, four months with Persephone and four months of the years with whomever he chose. He always chose Aphrodite because Persephone was the cold, unfeeling goddess of the underworld.

Adonis was eventually killed by a jealous [[Ares]]. Aphrodite was warned of this jealousy and was told that Adonis would be killed by a bull that Ares transformed into.  She tried to persuade Adonis to stay with her at all times, but his love of hunting was his downfall. While Adonis was hunting, Ares found him and gored him to death. Aphrodite arrived just in time to hear his last breath.

It is also said that Aphrodite bore a daughter to Adonis, [[Beroe]].

=== The [[Judgement of Paris]] ===
The gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]] (the eventual parents of [[Achilles]]). Only the goddess [[Eris]] (Discord) was not invited, but she arrived with a golden [[apple]] inscribed with the words &quot;to the fairest,&quot; which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, [[Hera]], and [[Athena]] all claimed the apple, and the matter was put before [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], the most handsome mortal. Hera tried to bribe Paris with an earthly kingdom, while Athena offered great military skill, but Aphrodite was judged most beautiful when she offered Paris the most beautiful mortal woman as a wife. This woman was [[Helen]], and her abduction by Paris led to the [[Trojan War]].

=== Pygmalion and Galatea ===
[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] was a sculptor who had never found a woman worthy of his love.  Aphrodite took pity on him and decided to show him the wonders of love. One day, Pygmalion was inspired by a dream of Aphrodite to make a woman out of [[ivory]] resembling her image, and he called her [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]]. He fell in love with the statue and decided he could not live without her. He prayed to Aphrodite, who carried out the final phase of her plan and brought the exquisite sculpture to life. Pygmalion loved Galatea and they were soon married.

Another version of this myth tells that the women of the village in which Pygmalion lived grew angry that he had not married. They all asked Aphrodite to force him to marry. Aphrodite accepted and went that very night to Pygmalion, and asked him to pick a woman to marry. She told him that if he did not pick one, she would do so for him. Not wanting to be married, he begged her for more time, asking that he be allowed to make a sculpture of Aphrodite before he had to choose his bride. Flattered, she accepted.

Pygmalion spent a lot of time making small clay sculptures of the Goddess, claiming it was needed so he could pick the right pose. As he started making the actual sculpture he was shocked to discover he actually wanted to finish, even though he knew he would have to marry someone when he finished. The reason he wanted to finish it was that he had fallen in love with the sculpture. The more he worked on it, the more it changed, until it no longer resembled Aphrodite at all.

At the very moment Pygmalion stepped away from the finished sculpture Aphrodite appeared and told him to choose his bride. Pygmalion chose the statue. Aphrodite told him that could not be, and asked him again to pick a bride. Pygmalion put his arms around the statue, and asked Aphrodite to turn him into a statue so he could be with her. Aphrodite took pity on him and brought the statue to life instead.

=== Other Stories ===
In one version of the story of [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]], Aphrodite was the catalyst for his death. He scorned the worship of Aphrodite for [[Artemis]] and, in revenge, Aphrodite caused his step-mother, [[Phaedra]], to fall in love with him, knowing Hippolytus would reject her. In the most popular version of the story, the play &quot;Hippolytus&quot; by [[Euripides]], Phaedra seeks revenge against Hippolytus by killing herself and, in her [[suicide note]], telling [[Theseus]], her husband and Hippolytus' father, that Hippolytus had raped her.  Theseus then murdered his own son before Artemis told him the truth.

King [[Glaucus]] of Corinth angered Aphrodite and she made her horses angry during the funeral games of King [[Pelias]]. They tore him apart. His ghost supposedly frightened horses during the [[Isthmian Games]]. 

Aphrodite was often accompanied by the [[Charites]].

In book III of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', Aphrodite saves [[Paris]] when he is about to be killed by [[Menelaos]].

Aphrodite was very protective of her son, Aeneas, who fought in the [[Trojan War]]. [[Diomedes]] almost killed Aeneas in battle but Aphrodite saved him. Diomedes wounded Aphrodite and she dropped her son, fleeing to [[Mt. Olympus]]. Aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by [[Artemis]], who took him to [[Pergamos (Troy)|Pergamos]], a sacred spot in [[Troy]]. [[Apollo]] healed Aeneas there. 

She turned [[Abas]] to stone for his pride.

She turned [[Anaxarete]] to stone for reacting so dispassionately to [[Iphis]]' pleas to love him, even after his suicide.

Aphrodite helps [[Hippomenes]] to win a footrace against [[Atalanta]] to win Atalanta's hand in marriage, giving him three golden apples to distract her with. However, when the couple fails to thank Aphrodite, she has them turned into lions (in other accounts they are turned into lions when either [[Zeus]] or [[Cybele]] find them having sex in their temple).

==Aphrodite in Neopaganism==
In many modern [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] [[sect]]s, particularly [[New Age]] ''Hellenistic'' sects in the [[United States]], Aphrodite takes on the role of the goddess of passion. Not all passion Aphrodite inspires is lustful, much of it is believed to take the form of artistic passion and even passion in argument. Worship of Aphrodite is uncommon and is typically held by individual writers and artists. How she is worshipped often depends on what other gods a sect includes. For example, sects that worship [[Hera]] and/or [[Themis]] may include worship of Aphrodite, but encourage monogamy and stress her role in committed relationships and marriage. Sects that worship [[Dionysus]] and Aphrodite may be entirely hedonistic and include orgiastic rituals (such sects are often considered cults even by Neopagan standards). As such worship of Aphrodite varies between sects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a [[binary relation]] ''R'' on a [[set]] ''X'' is '''antisymmetric''' if, for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X'', if ''a'' is related to ''b'' and ''b'' is related to ''a'', then ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''.

In [[mathematical notation]], this is:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall a, b \in X,\ a R b \and b R a \; \Rightarrow \; a = b&lt;/math&gt;

[[inequality|Inequalities]] are antisymmetric, since for different numbers ''a'' and ''b'' not both ''a &amp;le; b'' and ''a &amp;ge; b'' can be true.

Note that 'antisymmetric' is not the logical negative of '[[symmetric relation|symmetric]]' (whereby ''aRb'' implies ''bRa'').  (N.B.: Both are properties of relations expressed as universal statements about their members; their logical negations must be existential statements.)  Thus, there are relations which are both symmetric and antisymmetric (e.g., [[equality (mathematics)|the equality relation]]) and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric (e.g., [[divisibility]] on the [[integer]]s).

Antisymmetry is different from [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetry]].  According to one definition of '''asymmetric''', anything that fails to be symmetric is asymmetric; the definition of antisymmetry is more specific than this.  Another definition of '''asymmetric''' makes asymmetry equivalent to antisymmetry plus [[reflexive relation|irreflexivity]].

==Examples==
* [[Equality (mathematics) |Equality]]
* &quot;... is even, ... is odd&quot;
::::::[[Image:Evenandodd.PNG]]

==Properties containing antisymmetry==

* [[Partial order]] - An antisymmetric relation that is also [[transitive relation|transitive]] and [[reflexive relation|reflexive]].

* [[Total_order|total order]] - An antisymmetric relation that is also [[transitive relation|transitive]] and [[total relation|total]].

'''Aleister Crowley''', born '''Edward Alexander Crowley''' ([[12 October]] [[1875]] – [[1 December]] [[1947]]) was an [[occult]]ist, [[mystic]], [[sexual revolution]]ary, and drug user (especially [[opium]]). 

Other interests and accomplishments were wide-ranging (he was a [[chess master]], [[mountain climber]], [[poet]], [[writer]], [[painter]], [[astrologer]] and social [[critic]]). He was quite notorious during his life, and was dubbed &quot;The Wickedest Man In the World&quot;; the term first appeared in [[1928]] in ''[[John Bull (disambiguation)|John Bull]]'', a [[tabloid]] pictorial of the day.

==Biography==
Edward Alexander Crowley was born in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], [[Warwickshire]], [[England]], between 11:00pm and 12 midnight on [[12 October]] [[1875]].

His father, Edward Crowley, once maintained a lucrative family [[brewery]] business and was retired at the time of Aleister's birth. His mother, Emily Bertha Bishop, drew roots from a [[Devon]] and [[Somerset]] family.

Aleister grew up in a staunch [[Plymouth Brethren]] household. His father, after retiring from his daily duties as a brewer, took up the practice of [[preaching]] at a fanatical pace. Daily Bible studies and private tutoring were mainstays in young Aleister's childhood; however, after his father's death, his mother's efforts at indoctrinating her son in the Christian faith only served to provoke Aleister's [[scepticism]]. As a child, young Aleister's constant rebellious behaviour displeased his devout mother to such an extent she would chastize him by calling him &quot;The Beast&quot; (from the Book of Revelation), an epithet that Crowley would later happily adopt for himself. He objected to the labelling of what he saw as life's most worthwhile and enjoyable activities as &quot;sinful&quot;.

In response, Crowley created his own philosophical system, ''Scientific Illuminism'' — a synthesis of various Eastern [[mysticism|mystical]] systems (including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Tantra]], the predecessor to Western sex magick, [[Zoroastrianism]] and the many systems of Yoga) fused with the Western occult sciences of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the many reformed rituals of [[Freemasonry]] he later reformulated within the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O). This system also appeals to scientific and philosophical [[scepticism]]. His undergraduate studies in [[chemistry]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] helped forge the [[scientific scepticism]] that later culminated in the many-volumed and unparalleled occult publication, ''[[The Equinox]].''

Following the death of his father, the young Aleister (then &quot;Alec&quot; or &quot;Alick&quot;) turned to a form of [[Satanism]] in grief. However, within a few years he abandoned this for [[atheism]] and [[hedonism]], or in his words, &quot;began to behave like a normal, healthy human being.&quot; During the year [[1897]], he slowly came to view earthly pursuits as useless and began his lifelong exploration of esoteric matters. A number of events contributed to this change. (The [[Aleister Crowley#Chess|section on chess]] in this article gives one example.)

Involved as a young adult in the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], he first studied mysticism with and made enemies of [[William Butler Yeats]] and [[Arthur Edward Waite]]. Like many in occult circles of the time, Crowley voiced the view that Waite was a pretentious bore through searing critiques of Waite's writings and editorials of other authors' writings.

His friend and former Golden Dawn associate [[Allan Bennett]] introduced him to the ideas of [[Buddhism]], while [[MacGregor Mathers|Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]], acting leader of the Golden Dawn organization, acted as his early mentor in western magick but would later become his enemy. Several decades after Crowley's participation in the Golden Dawn, Mathers claimed copyright protection over a particular ritual and sued Crowley for infringement after Crowley's public display of the ritual. In a book of fiction entitled ''[[Moonchild]],'' Crowley portrayed Mathers as the primary villain, including him as a character named SRMD, using the abbreviation of Mathers' magical name. Arthur Edward Waite also appeared in ''Moonchild'' as a villain named Arthwaite, while Bennett appeared in ''Moonchild'' as the main character's wise mentor, Simon Iff.

While he did not officially break with Mathers until [[1904]], Crowley lost faith in this teacher's abilities soon after the [[1900]] schism in the Golden Dawn (if not before). Later that year, Crowley travelled to Mexico and continued his magical studies in isolation. AC's writings suggest that he discovered the word ''[[Abracadabra|Abrahadabra]]'' during this time. (The article on this word explains the spelling.)

In October of [[1901]], after practising [[Raja Yoga]] for some time, he said he had reached a state he called [[dhyana]] — one of many states of unification in thoughts that are described in ''MAGICK Book IV'' (See [[egolessness|Crowley on egolessness]]). [[1902]] saw him writing the essay ''Berashith'' (the first word of [[Genesis (Old Testament)|Genesis]]), in which he gave [[meditation]] (or restraint of the mind to a single object) as the means of attaining his goal. The essay describes [[ceremony|ceremonial]] magic as a means of training the will, and of constantly directing one's thoughts to a given object through ritual. In his 1903 essay, ''Science and Buddhism'', Crowley urged an [[empirical]] approach to Buddhist teachings.

He said that a mystical experience in [[1904]] while on vacation in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], led to his founding of the [[philosophy of religion|religious philosophy]] known as [[Thelema]]. Aleister's wife Rose started to behave in an odd way, and this led him to think that some entity had made contact with her. At her instructions, he performed an invocation of the Egyptian god [[Horus]] on [[March 20]] with (he wrote) &quot;great success&quot;. According to Crowley, the god told him that a new magical Aeon had begun, and that A.C. would serve as its prophet. Rose continued to give information, telling Crowley in detailed terms to await a further revelation. On [[8 April]] and for the following two days at exactly noon he heard a voice, dictating the words of the text, ''Liber AL vel Legis,'' or ''[[The Book of the Law]],'' which Crowley wrote down. The voice claimed to be that of Aiwass (or Aiwaz &quot;the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat,&quot; or Horus, the god of force and fire, child of [[Isis and Osiris]]) and self-appointed conquering lord of the New Aeon, announced through his chosen scribe &quot;the prince-priest the Beast.&quot;

Portions of the book are in numerical [[cipher]], which Crowley claimed the inability to decode (Setian [[Michael Aquino]] later claimed to be able to decode them). Thelemic dogma (to the extent that Thelema has dogma) explains this by pointing to a warning within the ''Book of the Law'' — the speaker supposedly warned that the scribe, Ankh-af-na-khonsu (Aleister Crowley), was never to attempt to decode the ciphers, for to do so would end only in folly.  The later-written ''The Law is For All'' sees Crowley warning everyone not to discuss the writing amongst fellow critics, for fear that a [[dogma|dogmatic]] position would arise. While he declared a &quot;new Equinox of the Gods&quot; in early 1904, supposedly passing on the revelation of [[March 20]] to the occult community, it took years for Crowley to fully accept the writing of the ''Book of the Law'' and follow its doctrine. Only after countless attempts to test its writings did he come to embrace them as the official doctrine of the New Aeon of [[Horus]]. The remainder of his professional and personal careers were spent expanding the new frontiers of scientific [[illuminism]].  

Rose and Aleister had a daughter, whom AC named Nuit Ma Ahathoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith Crowley, in July of 1904. This child died in [[1906]]. They had another daughter, Lola Zaza, in the summer of that year, and AC devised a special ritual of thanksgiving for her birth. He performed a thanksgiving ritual before his first claimed success in the [[Abramelin]] operation, on [[October 9]], 1906. The events of that year gave the Abramelin book a central role in Crowley's system. He described the primary goal of the &quot;Great Work&quot; using a term from this book: &quot;the Knowledge and Conversation of the [[Holy Guardian Angel]].&quot; An essay in the first number of ''The Equinox'' gives several reasons for this choice of names:
:''1. Because Abramelin's system is so simple and effective.''

:''2. Because since all theories of the universe are absurd it is better to talk in the language of one which is patently absurd, so as to mortify the metaphysical man.''

:''3. Because a child can understand it.''

Crowley was notorious in his lifetime — a frequent target of attacks in the [[tabloid press]], which labelled him &quot;The Wickedest Man in the World&quot; to his evident amusement. At one point, he was expelled from [[Italy]] after having established a sort of [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], the organization of which was based on his personal philosophies, the [[Abbey of Thelema]], at Cefalu, [[Sicily]].

In [[1934]] Crowley was declared bankrupt after losing a court case in which he sued the artist [[Nina Hamnett]] for calling him a black magician in her [[1932]] book, ''Laughing Torso.'' In addressing the jury, Mr Justice Swift said: 
&quot;I have been over forty years engaged in the administration of the law in one capacity or another. I thought that I knew of every conceivable form of wickedness. I thought that everything which was vicious and bad had been produced at one time or another before me. I have learnt in this case that we can always learn something more if we live long enough. I have never heard such dreadful, horrible, blasphemous and abominable stuff as that which has been produced by the man (Crowley) who describes himself to you as the greatest living poet.&quot;

Aleister Crowley died of a respiratory infection in a [[Hastings]] [[boarding house]] on [[December 1]], [[1947]], at the age of 72. According to some accounts he died on [[December 5]], [[1947]]. He was penniless and [[addict]]ed to [[opium]], which had been prescribed for his [[asthma]] and [[bronchitis]], at the time.

Biographer Lawrence Sutin passes on various stories about AC's death and last words. Frieda Harris supposedly reported him saying, &quot;I am perplexed,&quot; though she did not see him at the very end. According to John Symonds, a Mr Rowe witnessed Crowley's death along with a nurse, and reported his last words as, &quot;Sometimes I hate myself.&quot; Biographer Gerald Suster accepted the version of events he received from a &quot;[[Mr. W.H.|Mr W.H.]]&quot; in which Crowley dies pacing in his living-room. Supposedly Mr W.H. heard a crash while polishing furniture on the floor below, and entered Crowley's rooms to find him dead on the floor. Patricia &quot;Deirdre&quot; MacAlpine, the mother of his son, denied all this and reports a sudden gust of wind and peal of thunder at the (otherwise quiet) moment of his death. According to MacAlpine, Crowley remained bedridden for the last few days of his life, but was in light spirits and conversational. Readings at the cremation service in nearby Brighton included one of his own works, ''Hymn to Pan,'' and newspapers referred to the service as a [[black mass]]. [[Brighton]] council subsequently resolved to take all necessary steps to prevent such an incident occurring again.

==Chess==
Crowley learnt to play chess at the age of six and first competed on the Eastbourne College chess team (where he was taking classes in [[1892]]). He showed immediate competence, beating the adult champion in town and even editing a chess column for the local newspaper, the Eastbourne Gazette (Sutin, p.33), which he often used to criticise the Eastbourne team. He later joined the university chess club at [[Cambridge]], where he beat the president in his freshman year and practised two hours a day towards becoming a champion — &quot;My one serious worldly ambition had been to become the champion of the world at chess&quot; (Confessions, p.193). 

However, he gave up his chess aspirations in [[1897]] when attending a chess conference in Berlin: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; But I had hardly entered the room where the masters were playing when I was seized with what may justly be described as a mystical experience. I seemed to be looking on at the tournament from outside myself. I saw the masters — one, shabby, snuffy and blear-eyed; another, in badly fitting would-be respectable shoddy; a third, a mere parody of humanity, and so on for the rest. These were the people to whose ranks I was seeking admission. &quot;There, but for the grace of God, goes Aleister Crowley,&quot; I exclaimed to myself with disgust, and there and then I registered a vow never to play another serious game of chess. I perceived with preternatural lucidity that I had not alighted on this planet with the object of playing chess. (Confessions, Ch.16). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mountaineering==
In the summer of [[1902]], [[Oscar Eckenstein]] and Crowley undertook the first attempt to scale Chogo Ri (known in the west as [[K2]]), located in [[Pakistan]]. The Eckenstein-Crowley Expedition consisted of Eckenstein, Crowley, [[Guy Knowles]], H. Pfannl, V. Wesseley, and Dr [[Jules Jacot-Guillarmod]]. During this trip he won a world record for his hardships on the [[Baltoro Glacier]], sixty-eight straight days of glacial life.  

In May [[1905]], he was approached by Dr [[Jules Jacot-Guillarmod]] ([[1868]] - [[1925]]) to accompany him on the first expedition to [[Kanchenjunga]] in [[Nepal]], the third largest mountain in the world. Guillarmod was left to organize the personnel while Crowley left to get things ready in [[Darjeeling]]. On [[July 31]] Guillarmod joined Crowley in Darjeeling, bringing with him two countrymen, Charles-Adolphe Reymond and Alexis Pache. Meanwhile, Crowley had recruited a local man, Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, to act as Transport Manager. The team left Darjeeling on [[August 8]], [[1905]], and used the [[Singalila Ridge]] approach to Kangchenjunga. At [[Chabanjong]] they ran into the rear of the 135 [[coolie]]s who had been sent ahead on [[July 24]] and [[July 25]], who were carrying food rations for the team. The trek was led by Aleister Crowley, but four members of that party were killed in an avalanche. Some claims say they reached around 21,300 feet before turning back, however Crowley's autobiography claims they reached about 25,000 feet.

Crowley was sometimes famously scathing about other climbers, in particular [[O. G. Jones]], whom he considered a risk-taking self-publicist, and his 'two photographers' ([[George and Ashley Abraham]]).

==Science, magic, and sexuality==
Crowley claimed to use a [[scientific method]] to study what people at the time called &quot;spiritual&quot; experiences, making &quot;The Method of Science, the Aim of Religion&quot; the catchphrase of his magazine ''The Equinox''. By this he meant that mystical experiences should not be taken at [[face value]], but critiqued and experimented with in order to arrive at their underlying religious meaning. In this he may be considered to foreshadow Dr. [[Timothy Leary]], who at one point sought to apply the same method to [[psychedelic drug]] experiences. Yet like Leary's, Crowley's method has received little &quot;scientific&quot; attention outside the circle of Thelema's practitioners.

Crowley's magical and initiatory system has amongst its innermost reaches a set of teachings on sex &quot;magick.&quot; He frequently expressed views about sex that were radical for his time, and published numerous poems and tracts combining pagan religious themes with sexual imagery both heterosexual and homosexual.

[[Sex Magick]] is the use of the sex act—or the energies, passions or arousal states it evokes—as a point upon which to focus the will or magical desire for effects in the non-sexual world. In this, Crowley was inspired by [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]], an American author writing in the [[1870s]] who wrote (in his book ''Eulis!'') of using the &quot;nuptive moment&quot; (orgasm) as the time to make a &quot;prayer&quot; for events to occur.

==Women==

During March [[1899]] Crowley met, at one of the semi-public performances of MacGregor Mathers' [[Rites of Isis]], an American [[soprano]] by the name of [[Susan Strong]] ([[3 August]], [[1870]] - [[11 March]], [[1946]]). Susan was the daughter of [[Dennis Strong]], an American Congressman and mayor of [[Brooklyn]]. She had gone to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] at the age of 21 and had enrolled in the [[Royal College of Music]], [[London]] under the tutelage of the famous Hungarian musician [[Francis Korbay]]. Crowley met up with her again in London when she sang the part of Venus in ''[[Tannhäuser (Wagner)|Tannhäuser]]'' on [[22 June]] [[1899]]. A torrid romance followed during which Susan swore to divorce her American husband and devote herself to Crowley.  However on her return to the US, around October [[1899]], she apparently cooled in ardour.  Crowley followed her to [[New York]] in June of the following year, but by then she was already on her way back to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to appear in performances of the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]]. During [[1900]], while in Mexico City, Crowley experienced an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], during which he transcribed his play, titled ''[[Tannhäuser]]''.  He attributed the inspiration of this play to his romance with Susan Strong.

==Thelema==
*''see also [[Thelema]]''

The religious or mystical system which Crowley founded, into which most of his writings fall, he named '''[[Thelema]]'''.  Thelema combines a radical form of philosophical [[libertarianism]], akin in some ways to [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], with a mystical initiatory system derived in part from the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]]. 

Chief among the precepts of Thelema is the [[sovereignty of the individual]] will: &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.&quot; Crowley's idea of ''will,'' however, is not simply the individual's desires or wishes, but also incorporates a sense of the person's destiny or greater purpose: what he termed the &quot;Magick Will.&quot; Much of the initiatory system of Thelema is focused on discovering one's true will, true purpose, or [[higher self]]. Much else is devoted to an Eastern-inspired dissolution of the individual [[ego]], as a means to that end (see [[Choronzon]]).

The second precept of Thelema is &quot;Love is the law, love under will&quot; — and Crowley's meaning of &quot;Love&quot; is as complex as that of &quot;Will&quot;. It is frequently sexual: Crowley's system, like elements of the Golden Dawn before him, sees the dichotomy and tension between the male and female as fundamental to existence, and sexual &quot;magick&quot; and metaphor form a significant part of Thelemic ritual.

Thelema draws on numerous older sources and, like many other [[new religious movement]]s of its time, combines &quot;Western&quot; and &quot;Eastern&quot; traditions. Its chief Western influences include the Golden Dawn and elements of [[Freemasonry]]; Eastern influences include aspects of [[yoga]], [[Taoism]], [[Kabbalah]] and [[Tantra]].

==Writings==
Within the subject of occultism Crowley wrote widely, penning commentaries on the [[Tarot]] ''([[The Book of Thoth]])'', [[yoga]] ''(Book Four)'', the [[Kabbalah]] ''(Sepher Sephiroth)'', [[astrology]] ''(The General Principles of Astrology)'', and numerous other subjects. He also wrote a Thelemic &quot;translation&quot; of the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'', based on earlier English translations since he knew little or no Chinese. Like the Golden Dawn mystics before him, Crowley evidently sought to comprehend the entire human religious and mystical experience in a single philosophy. He self-published many of his books, expending the majority of his inheritance to disseminate his views. Many of his fiction works, such as the &quot;Simon Iff&quot; detective stories and ''[[Moonchild]]'' have not received significant notice outside of occult circles. However his fictional work ''[[Diary Of A Drug Fiend]]'' has received acclaim from those involved in the field of [[substance-abuse rehabilitation|substance abuse rehabilitation]].

Crowley's most grandiose work is ''[[The Equinox]]'', a large bi-annual periodical that served as the official organ of the [[Argenteum Astrum]] (A∴A∴), and, later, the [[O.T.O.]] It was subtitled &quot;The Review of Scientific Illuminism&quot; and remains one of the definitive works on [[occultism]].

Crowley's other major works include:
* ''[[The Book of Lies]]''
* ''[[The Holy Books of Thelema]]''
* ''[[Konx om Pax]]''

He also wrote a short, highly readable introduction to [[yoga]] (''Eight Lectures on Yoga'') and a [[polemic]] arguing against [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s interpretation of the [[Gospels]] in his preface to ''[[Androcles and the Lion]]''. Crowley's piece was edited by [[Francis King]] and published as ''Crowley on Christ'', and shows him at his erudite and witty best.

Crowley had a peculiar sense of humour. In his ''Book Four'' he includes a chapter purporting to illuminate the Qabalistic significance of [[Mother Goose]] [[nursery rhyme]]s. ''In re'' [[Humpty Dumpty]], for instance, he recommends the occult authority &quot;Ludovicus Carolus&quot; -- better known as [[Lewis Carroll]]. In a footnote to the chapter he admits that he had invented the alleged meanings, to show that one can find occult &quot;Truth&quot; in everything. The title to chapter [[69 (number)|69]] is given as &quot;The Way to Succeed - and the Way to Suck Eggs!&quot; a pun, as the chapter concerns the [[69 sex position]] as a mystical act.

Many Crowley biographies relate the story of [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and [[Jack Parsons]] and their attempt to create a &quot;moonchild&quot; (from Crowley's novel of that name). In Crowley's own words, &quot;Apparently Parsons and Hubbard or somebody is producing a moonchild. I get fairly frantic when I contemplate the idiocy of these louts.&quot;  Clearly the admiration Hubbard had for Crowley was not reciprocated.

More famously still, he baited [[Christianity|Christians]] by naming himself [[To Mega Therion]], or &quot;The Great Beast&quot; of the [[Book of Revelation]].

Crowley was also a published, if minor, poet. He wrote the [[1929]] ''Hymn to Pan'' [http://www.paganlibrary.com/music_poetry/crowleys_pan_invocation.php], perhaps his most widely read and anthologized poem. Three pieces by Crowley, &quot;The Quest [http://www.bartleby.com/236/314.html]&quot;, &quot;The Neophyte [http://www.bartleby.com/236/315.html]&quot;, and &quot;The Rose and the Cross [http://www.bartleby.com/236/316.html]&quot;, appear in the [[1917]] collection ''[[The Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse]]''.  Crowley's unusual sense of humour is on display in ''White Stains'' [http://www.rahoorkhuit.net/library/crowley/stain.html], an [[1898]] collection of [[pornography|pornographic]] verse pretended to be &quot;the literary remains of George Archibald Bishop, a neuropath of the Second Empire;&quot; the volume is prefaced with a notice that says that &quot; The Editor hopes that Mental Pathologists, for whose eyes alone this treatise is destined, will spare no precaution to prevent it falling into other hands.&quot;

==Miscellany==
*Crowley also tried to mint a number of new terms instead of the established ones he felt inadequate. For example he spelled [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] &quot;[[magick]]&quot; and renamed [[theurgy]] &quot;high magick&quot; and [[thaumaturgy]] &quot;low magick&quot;.

*&quot;In World War I Aleister Crowley ingratiated himself with a Hermetic sect in order to reveal to the Americans that its head was a highly dangerous German agent. In World War II it was well known in British Intelligence that many leading Nazis were interested in the occult and especially in astrology. Crowley did some work for [[MI5]], but his project for dropping occult information by leaflet on the enemy was rejected by the authorities.&quot; - Richard Deacon, Spyclopaedia

The '''afterlife''' (or '''life after death''') is a generic term referring to a '''continuation''' of [[existence]], typically [[spirituality|spiritual]] and experiential, beyond this world, or after death.  This article is about current generic and widely held or reported concepts of afterlife.  ''See also: [[Underworld]], for a comprehensive catalog of specific traditions about afterlife.''

==Afterlife as a belief==
Many people believe in an afterlife. It is generally described as a non-verifiable and non-falsifiable [[belief]] within a [[religion]], because it is generally accepted as beyond the experiential knowledge or casual accessibility of most people (see [[esoteric knowledge]]).  As a result, the popular mind relies on various sources for concepts about afterlife, arranged below in presumed order of reliability:
*Testimony of individuals who claim experiential knowledge of facets of afterlife
**by having died and then been sent back to this life ([[near-death experience]]s)
**by having visited the afterlife during a period of unconsciousness ([[out-of-body experience]]s)
**by having seen the afterlife during a revelatory vision
**by a unique personal gift of remembering an afterlife (before-life) existence
**by having communicated with (or received a message from) someone who has passed over ([[after death communication]] or [[electronic voice phenomenon|electronic voice phenomena]])
*Testimony of individuals who are presumed to have special insights into the afterlife
**holy ones
**miracle workers
**spectacular converts
*Claimed testimony of visitors from the afterlife
**God
**Angels
**Spirits
*Human intuitions of goodness assumed to emanate from the afterlife
*Speculation and extrapolation
*Concoction

While there is information available from all of the above sources, a preponderance of concoctions, speculations, and extrapolations have arguably historically characterized formal descriptions of afterlife.   Religious traditions have historically formalized and codified ideas about afterlife in widely divergent forms.  Though the onset of the [[information age]] is bringing to light increasing consistency and uniformity of beliefs about afterlife from across and without religious boundaries, most afterlife conceptions continue to follow traditional descriptions, often viewed as rationally weak by skeptics who -- particularly [[atheism|atheists]] and [[agnosticism|agnostics]] of a secular humanist mindset -- may hold that we entirely cease to exist.  However, it should be pointed out that not all atheists and agnostics necessarily rule out the existence of an afterlife. For example, many [[buddhism|Buddhists]] neither confirm nor deny the existence of the supernatural (gods, demons, heavens, hells, etc.), while simultaneously embracing the concept of [[rebirth (Buddhist)|rebirth]].

For those who do believe in an afterlife, the various conceptions about it differ in their answer to the following questions:

* Is the afterlife a normal life, or a different type of existence?
* Are afterlife conditions a consequence of good and bad actions during life?
* Is afterlife eternal?
* Is it possible to reincarnate as a human or other form of life?
* What happens at the moment of death?
* Are [[ghost]]s and other [[undead]] a proof of an afterlife?

==Afterlife as an individual existence==
For an afterlife to exist, there must be something that survives the body when death occurs. This something is usually believed to be extraphysical and is usually called [[soul]] or spirit. Philosophers have long debated whether such an extraphysical substance can exist; see [[Mind-body problem]].

== Afterlife as reward or punishment ==
One notion of afterlife which is common to [[Judaism]] (see [[Jewish eschatology#The afterlife and olam haba (the world to come)|the afterlife and ''olam haba'' [&quot;world to come&quot;] ]]), most sects of [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] is that human [[soul]]s go on for [[eternity]] to a place of [[happiness]] or [[torment]], such as [[heaven]], [[hell]], or [[purgatory]] or [[limbo]].  

Many [[religion|religions]] hold that after death people get reward or punishment based on their deeds or faith.

The [[Christian Bible]], for example, contains the words of Jesus: &quot;The measure you give will be the measure you get.&quot; ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 4:24).

Some Christians, however, assert that Christianity does not hold to the doctrine that entry into Heaven can be earned, rather that it is a gift that is solely God's to give.  A common line of reasoning for this is as follows: The Christian Bible states that &quot;all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,&quot; ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 3:23) meaning nobody has ever managed to live their life without sinning at least once, and this precludes any sort of afterlife reward.   Furthermore, &quot;the wages of sin is death...the gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot; ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 6:23)  &quot;Eternal life&quot; is traditionally accepted to mean life in Heaven, after death.  These passages lead some to believe that Christianity may be the only religion that does not hold to the doctrine that entry into Heaven can be earned, as nobody could ever earn it, and it is a gift that is solely God's to give.

For many, belief in an afterlife is a consolation in connection with death of a beloved one or the prospect of one's own death. On the other hand, [[fear]] of hell etc. may make death worse.

In the informal folk beliefs of many Christians, the souls of virtuous people ascend to Heaven and are converted into [[angels]] upon their deaths. However, a more literal reading of scripture suggests that the dead wait until the [[Last Judgment]], which is followed by resurrection for the faithful.  More formal Christian theology makes a sharp distinction between ''angels'', who were created by [[God]] before the creation of humanity, and ''saints'', who are virtuous people who have received immortality from the grace of [[God]].

In view of the eternity of afterlife, some consider regular life as relatively unimportant, except for determining whether afterlife follows, and/or what kind. It is just a provisional situation, and the [[metaphor]] of a [[tent]] as provisional housing facility is used as quoted below:

:''For we know that if our earthly house of this [[tabernacle]] were dissolved, we have a [[building]] of God, a [[house]] not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.''(Bible, 2 Corinthians 5:1)

In what we know of [[Egyptian religion]], afterlife is very important.
The believer had to act well and know the rituals explained in the [[Egyptian Book of the Dead]].
If the corpse was properly [[embalm]]ed and entombed in a [[mastaba]], the defunct would relive in the [[Fields of Yalu]] and accompany the Sun god on its daily ride.
If, during the [[psychomachia]], the souls&lt;!-- ka or ba? --&gt; of the defunct were found faulty, the [[Devourer]] monster would eat them.

Others, including some Universalists, believe in [[universalism]] which holds that all will eventually be rewarded regardless of what they have done or believed.

Life after death, however, is in no way a universal belief; for example, Jehovah's Witnesses interpret Ecclesiastes 9:5 as precluding an afterlife:

:''For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward;for the memory of them is forgotten.''

They believe that a resurrection in the flesh at some future date will be a reward and that death (non-existence) is a punishment.

== Afterlife as reincarnation ==
Another afterlife concept which is found among [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and [[Wicca|Wiccans]] is [[reincarnation]], whether as humans, [[animal]]s, or as spiritual beings. One consequence of the Hindu and Buddhist beliefs is that our current lives are also an afterlife, and both Hindus and Buddhists interpret events in our current life as being consequences of actions taken in previous lives, or [[Karma]].

Some [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] believe in personal reincarnation, whereas some believe that the energy of one's soul reintegrates with a continuum of such energy which is recycled into other living things as they are born.

== Afterlife and modern science==
Other conceptions of an afterlife do not depend as heavily on [[religion]].  Certain scientific fields developed in the [[20th century|20th]] and [[21st century|21st centuries]], that were previously either unknown or purely theoretical, support interesting speculation and questions regarding the afterlife.

For instance, the [[special theory of relativity]], known to many people at least in part through its most famous [[equation]] ([[Energy|E]]=[[mass|m]][[speed of light|c]]²), implies that neither [[matter]] nor [[energy]] can be created nor destroyed.  This implies that the fundamental quantities that our [[brain]]s are comprised of cannot actually be destroyed.  However, it is certainly observed that the specific composition of those quantities which produces the [[electromagnetic]] [[Electric current|current]]s and [[field (physics)|fields]] thought to comprise [[consciousness]] and [[cognition]] do change after death to forms that no longer produce these currents and fields, which presents the question:  Is consciousness a sole result of the specific configuration of matter of a living brain, or do some forms of consciousness or experience remain present in the matter and energy that used to be a living brain?  If the latter is true, even in part, then it is not certain that the subjective experience of a being's consciousness ends at the time of death, which could be strongly interpreted as a form of afterlife.

Also, the nature of consciousness and [[sentience]] itself is a subject of wide debate, and not agreed upon by any means.  The emerging field of [[cognitive science]] attempts to study the nature of consciousness, sentience, and cognition.  It is now possible to study the brain at moments closer to death than ever before, which may lead to insights regarding the cesstion of cognition, and possibly even insights into the subjective experience of consciousness at those times.  Greater understanding of these concepts, and the processes that produce them, might have wide-ranging consequences for conceptions of an afterlife.

In a social-sciences sense, the increasing globalization of the world has exposed many people to new religions and [[philosophy|philosophies]].  While the major monotheistic religions of the world ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and their offshoots) almost universally preach some form of [[Cartesian dualism|mind-body dualism]], many &quot;Eastern&quot; religions, such as the many branches of [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] do not contain any such claims, and may in fact preach ideologies that are opposed to it.  [[Zen Buddhism]] in particular is famous for [[koan]]s and parables that are meant to teach that the nature of consciousness is transient and/or [[illusion|illusory]], with some schools going so far as to say that even the concept of a &quot;self&quot; is fundamentally flawed.  Philosophical conceptions such as these, which reject mind-body dualism and contain ideas of life and existence separate from a &quot;self&quot; or unique [[soul]], remove in large part one of the major criticisms of scientific individuals regarding the afterlife - namely, that an individual must have a soul in order to experience consciousness after death.  

The emerging field of [[artificial intelligence]] in [[computing]] presents interesting questions regarding an experience of afterlife, as well:  If a [[robot]] is created which possesses cognition and problem-solving comparable to a human, is that robot considered conscious or &quot;alive&quot;?  If so, can he, she, or it &quot;die&quot;?  The memories of such robots, if they are ever constructed, could theoretically be composed of some form of electronic storage and stored on devices identical in purpose to modern [[hard drive]]s, which can be completely copied in a matter of seconds or hours.  If a [[backup]] is made of such a theoretical robot's memory at some point, and that robot's current memory then is damaged, destroyed, or rendered inoperable, and then restored from the backup, in what sense, if any, does the newly restored robot's experience constitute [[resurrection]] - especially if, for instance, a [[wireless network]] is used to back up the robot's memory to the exact moment of destruction?  Assuming that artificial intelligence [[research]] continues at the rapid pace it has shown so far, these and related questions may become quite meaningful in the future.

Finally, though it is not a traditional conception of an afterlife by any means, one particular (and controversial) interpretation of [[quantum physics]] actually implies that a conscious soul may be [[immortal]] in a certain sense - see [[quantum immortality]].  (Though, admittely, in this theory, the organism does not strictly ever &quot;die&quot;, so the term &quot;afterlife&quot; may be inappropriate.)

==Related studies==
In philosophy, the study of views of the afterlife is a concern of [[Eschatology]], which deals with the soul, the [[resurrection]] of the dead, the messianic era, and the end of the world. 

The question of whether there is life after death is closely related to [[the mind-body problem]], and like that problem is one of the classic problems of so-called [[rational psychology]] and hence of one (now largely outdated) notion of the scope of [[metaphysics]].

The later works of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] present one of the most comprehensive and systematic descriptions of the spiritual world, including [[heaven]] and [[hell]].

==Criticism==
Upon death, [[brain]] activity ceases and a person's body begins to [[decompose]].  This marks the end of the individual's [[mind]] in the physical world.  The fundamental belief of an afterlife is that there exists a non-physical means (a soul or spirit) for the mind to survive the brain's destruction and continue to function in a non-physical world.

[[Occam's Razor]] is used by skeptics as a counter to this belief.  There are two basic alternatives to be compared:

*When you die, your mind ceases to function and your body decomposes.
*When you die, your mind continues to function despite the physical destruction of your brain, continuing its existence in a non-physical world.

The first belief is simple and well-supported.  Much available scientific evidence indicates that the mind is the product of the brain's activity, and that destruction of the brain also destroys the mind.  Therefore, some people conclude that believing in an afterlife (at least in a logically-consistent way) requires the additional [[assumption]]s that:

*There exists a non-physical entity associated with a person (the soul or spirit).
*The mind can continue to operate in the absence of the brain, being somehow supported by the soul.
*The soul exists in a non-physical [[Plane (cosmology)|dimension]] that we are unable to perceive in a measurable way.

Despite there being some objective evidence to support these beliefs, skeptics assert that science cannot prove the existence of an afterlife. The fact that these beliefs are nevertheless widely held may be explained by [[wishful thinking]].

Humans instinctively fear death as we know that our eventual deaths are inevitable.  Therefore it is unsurprising that a belief system which promises an escape from death would be strongly embraced.  People often suspend their better judgment when presented with &quot;too good to be true&quot; promises (consider [[Advance fee fraud|Nigerian scams]] and similar instances of fraud), and an escape from death is considered by some to be the ultimate promise.

The philosophical belief of [[materialism]] holds that only the physical universe exists.  Though not all materialists would argue that this precludes belief in an afterlife, a great number of them do hold this viewpoint.  [[Atheism]] and materialism are closely related, and most atheists do not believe in any sort of afterlife.  

=== Logical arguments ===
If one accepts the afterlife, one also has to accept the concept of a [[soul]], since when someone dies, the physical body [[decompose]]s. Some religions assert that only humans have a soul (although some religions say that some other life forms, such as animals, also do). The question remains as to why would monkeys, which have been shown to be intelligent, not have a soul while humans would. Also, since at the [[subatomic]] level, all things are made of the same elements, why would other animals, plants--or even rocks--not have a soul? If intelligence is the criteria to have a soul, where would the line be drawn as far as mentally challenged people, or very smart animals? (This topic appears often in the work of [[Peter Singer]])

Another argument is that historically, many religions consider women lower than men in many walks of life. These discriminatory themes were also applied against black people in [[USA|America]], or earlier against [[Muslim]]s during the [[crusade]]s, where some human beings were described as having no soul, or going straight to [[Hell]]. It therefore seems that each argument, while based on a sacred ancient text of some sort (the [[Bible]], the [[Qur'an]], etc), are adapted to fit the modern world.{{fact}}

A last logical argument is that if all humans have an afterlife, and go to [[Heaven]] or [[Hell]], then their behavior in those places may be [[determinism|determined]], rather than willfully exerted. People either have free will, or don't. Free will is considered by many to be necessary to have a soul. If they do, then surely there should be evil in Heaven, and good in Hell.

=== Philosophical arguments ===

Some non-believers in an afterlife, influenced by [[positivism (philosophy)]], have argued that claims of an afterlife are [[unverifiable]] and [[unfalsifiable]], and therefore cognitively [[meaningless]]. Some have argued that, on the contrary, particular claims concerning the nature of the afterlife are verifiable and falsifiable: all one has to do to verify/falsify them is die. On the other hand, they argue, the belief in the absence of an afterlife can be attacked as vacuous on the grounds that the statement &quot;I cease to exist&quot; is unverifiable, unfalsifiable, and therefore by the same token cognitively meaningless. In particular, the concept of our own non-existence is inconceivable (what experience corresponds to your own non-existence? none.)

Other philosophical issues about the idea of an afterlife can be expressed in thought experiments. Johnny is shot and ceases existence for five minutes ( allow, for the sake of the thought experiment, regardless of your beliefs, that he does not experience any form of afterlife in this time.) Then, five minutes later Johnny is cloned, an exact replica is made, possessing all of the factual knowledge, beliefs, values, intentional states and emotions etc he had at the time of death. Is this being the same Johnny that was killed? The result of this thought experiment is arguably very important to some religious groups.

Now, imagine that in accordance with the doctrines of some religious groups, that a person X dies and is ressurected after a period of death and essential non-existence (lack of awareness). Is this X the same X that died? The issue at stake is essentially whether identity is continuity over time, or a set of traits, i.e complexes of memory, personality, a soul etc.

'''Astrometry''' is a branch of [[astronomy]] that deals with the positions of [[star]]s and other [[celestial body|celestial bodies]], their distances and movements.

It is one of the oldest subfields of the [[science]], the successor to the more qualitative study of [[positional astronomy]]. Astrometry dates back at least to [[Hipparchus (astronomer)|Hipparchus]], who compiled the first [[Star catalogue|catalogue of stars]] visible to him and in doing so invented the [[Apparent magnitude|brightness scale]] basically still in use today. Modern astrometry was founded by [[Friedrich Bessel]] with his ''Fundamenta astronomiae'', which gave the mean position of 3222 stars observed between 1750 and 1762 by [[James Bradley]].

Apart from the fundamental function of providing [[Astronomer]]s with a [[reference frame]] to report their observations in, astrometry is also fundamental for fields like [[celestial mechanics]], [[stellar dynamics]] and [[galactic astronomy]]. In [[observational astronomy]], astrometric techniques help identify stellar objects by their unique motions. It is instrumental for keeping [[time]], in that [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] is basically the [[International Atomic Time|atomic time]] synchronized to [[Earth]]'s rotation by means of exact observations. Astrometry is also involved in creating the [[cosmic distance ladder]] because it is used to establish [[parallax]] distance estimates for stars in the [[Milky Way]].

== Advances in astrometry ==

* [[Sundial]]s were effective at measuring time.
* [[Astrolabe]]s were invented for measuring celestial angles.
* Astrometric applications led to the development of [[spherical geometry]]
* Careful measurement of [[planetary motion]]s by [[Tycho Brahe]], followed by analysis by [[Johannes Kepler]] proved the [[Copernican principle]], that Earth revolves about the [[Sun]].
* The [[sextant]] dramatically improved measurement of celestial [[angle]]s.
* [[James Bradley]] measured [[aberration of light|stellar aberration]] with a precise transit telescope.
* The development of [[charge coupled device]]s (CCDs), and their adoption by astronomers in the 1980s, improved the precision of professional  astrometric work.
* The development of inexpensive CCDs, software, and telescopes allowed for large-scale [[amateur astronomy|amateur astrometric]] observation of [[minor planet]]s.
* From 1989 to 1993, the European Space Agency's [[Hipparcos]] satellite performed astrometric measurements resulting in a catalogue of positions accurate to 20-30 milliarcsec for over a million stars.

Astronomers use astrometric techniques for the tracking of [[near-Earth objects]]. It has been also been used to detect [[extrasolar planets]] by measuring the displacement they cause in their parent star's apparent position on the sky, due to their mutual orbit around the center of mass of the system.  NASA's planned [[Space Interferometry Mission]] ([[SIM PlanetQuest]]) will utilize astrometric techniques to detect [[terrestrial planets]] orbiting 200 or so of the nearest [[solar-type stars]].

Astrometric measurements are used by [[astrophysicist]]s to constrain certain models in [[celestial mechanics]].  By measuring the velocities of [[pulsar]]s, it is possible to put a limit on the [[asymmetry]] of [[supernova]] explosions. Also, astrometric results are used to determine the distribution of [[dark matter]] in the galaxy.

== Astrometrics ==

'''Astrometrics''' is the [[science]] of [[star|stellar]] [[measurement]]s and [[motion]]. Astrometrics was used, during the [[1990]]s, to detect [[extrasolar planet|extrasolar]] [[gas giant]]s [[orbit]]ing various [[solar system]]s. This was done by observing the &quot;[[stellar wobble]]&quot; of a star and calculating what kinds of [[gravity|gravitational]] [[force]]s would cause such motion; it was then determined that [[planet]]ary forces must be affecting the stars in question.

[[Image:Athena.png|right|thumb|200px|Drawing from a sculpture of Athena at the Louvre.]] 

'''Athena''', ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|Ἀθηνᾶ}} Athēnâ  or {{polytonic|Ἀθήνη}} Athénē; [[Doric Greek|Doric]]: {{polytonic|Ἀσάνα}} Asána), the [[Greece|Greek]] [[goddess]] of [[wisdom]], [[strategy]], [[crafts]] and [[war]] associated by the [[Etruria|Etruscan]]s with their [[Etruscan mythology|goddess]] [[Menrva]] and later by the Romans as [[Minerva]], is attended by an [[Little Owl|owl]], wore a goatskin breastplate called the [[Aegis]] given to her by her father and is accompanied by the goddess of victory, [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]. Athena is also a goddess associated with mentoring heroes. Athena is an armed warrior goddess, never a child, always a [[virgin]] (''parthenos''); she is said to have found the advances of men to be childish.  The [[Parthenon]] at Athens, Greece is her most famous shrine.  She never had a consort or lover, although once [[Hephaestus]] tried and failed.[[Herodotus]] and [[Plato]] incorrectly identified '''Athena''' with the [[Libyan (Ancient people)|Libyan]] (modern [[Berber]]s) goddess [[Neith]]. According to [[Plato]], Athena was derived from ''A-θεο-νόα'' (A-theo-noa) or ''H-θεο-νόα'' (E-theo-noa) meaning the mind of God ([[Cratylus|Crat.407b]]).  


==History==
[[Image:Athena head.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Athena from the east pediment of the Afea temple in [[Aegina]]]]

Athena was probably a goddess in the Aegean in the prehistoric times, although her name is not attested in [[Eteocretan]]. She has been compared to [[Anatolian]] mother goddesses like [[Cybele]], her name possibly of [[Lydian]] origin (G. Neumann, ''Kadmos'' 6, 1967), and her byname ''Pallas'' has been compared to Hittite ''palahh'', a divine raiment [http://www.dainst.org/index_79_en.html]. In [[Mycenaean Greek]], ''A-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja'' ''/Athana potniya/'' (Mistress Athena) is referred to in the [[Knossos]] [[Linear B]] text V 2. and  ''A-ta-no-dju-wa-ja'' ''/Athana diwya/'', the final part being the Linear B spelling of what we know from ancient Greek as ''Diwia'' (Mycenaean ''di-u-ja'' or ''di-wi-ja'') &quot;divine&quot; (see [[dyeus]]). There is evidence that in early times, Athena was an [[owl]] herself, or a [[bird goddess]] in general. In book 3 of the [[Odyssey]], she takes the form of a [[sea-eagle]]. Her tassled [[aegis]] may be the remnants of wings [http://www.fjkluth.com/athena.html].  Athena is associated with [[Athens]], a plural name because it was the place where she presided over her sisterhood, the Athenai, in earliest times. 

In the [[List of Greek mythological characters|Olympian pantheon]], Athena was remade as the favorite daughter of [[Zeus]], born from his forehead.  The story of her birth comes in several versions.  In the one most commonly cited, Zeus lay with [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], the goddess of crafty thought, but immediately feared the consequences. It had been prophesied that Metis would bear children more powerful than Zeus himself.  In order to forestall these dire consequences, Zeus transformed Metis into a fly and swallowed her immediately after lying with her.  He was too late: Metis had already conceived a child.  Metis immediately began making a helmet and robe for her fetal daughter.  The hammering as she made the helmet caused Zeus great pain and [[Prometheus]], [[Hephaestus]], [[Hermes]] or [[Palaemon]] (depending on the sources examined) cleaved Zeus's head with the double-headed Minoan axe ([[labrys]]).  Athena leaped from Zeus's head, fully grown and armed, and Zeus was none the worse for the experience.

Athena was patron of the art of weaving and other crafts, wisdom and battle.  Unlike [[Ares]], who was hot-headed and undependable in battle, Athena's domain was strategy and tactics. Having taken the side of the Greeks in the war against [[Troy]], Athena assisted the wily [[Odysseus]] on his journey home.

=== Athena in art ===
[[Image: AttalusICorrected.jpg|thumb|200px|right|'''Athena''' was depicted on the obverse side of the [[Coin]] of [[Attalus I]],  depicting the head of Attalus' great uncle [[Philetaerus]].]]
Athena is classically portrayed wearing full armor, carrying a lance and a shield with the head of the [[gorgon]] [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]] mounted on it.  It is in this posture that she was depicted in [[Phidias]]'s famous gold and ivory statue of her, the [[Athena Parthenos]], now lost to history, in the [[Parthenon]] on the Athenian [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]].  Athena is also often depicted with an [[owl]] (a symbol of wisdom) sitting on one of her shoulders.  The [[Mourning Athena]] is a relief sculpture that dates around 460 BC and portrays a tired, emotional Athena.

In earlier, archaic portraits of Athena in [[vase-painting]]s, the goddess retains some of her Minoan character, such as great birdwings.

=== Appellations ===
Homer's most common [[epithets in Homer|epithet]] for Athena, ''γλαυκώπις'' (glaukopis) is usually translated &quot;bright-eyed&quot; and is a combination of ''γλαύκος'' (glaukos) (which can be translated as &quot;gleaming,&quot; &quot;silvery,&quot; and later as &quot;bluish-green&quot; or &quot;gray&quot;) and ''ώψ'' (ôps - &quot;eye,&quot; or sometimes, &quot;face&quot;). It is interesting to note that ''γλαύξ'' (glaux - owl) is from the same root, presumably because of its own distinctive eyes. The bird which sees in the night is closely associated with the goddess of wisdom: in archaic images, she is frequently depicted with an owl perched on her head. In earlier times, Athena may well have been a [[bird goddess]], similar to [[Lilith|Lilitu]] and/or the goddess depicted with owls, wings and bird talons on the [[Burney relief]].

In her role as judge at [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]]' trial on the murder of his mother, [[Clytemnestra]] (which he won), Athena won the epithet &quot;Athena Areia.&quot; 

Athena was often associated with the local [[Aegina|Aeginian]] goddess, ''Αφαία'' ([[Aphaea]]).  She had the epithet &quot;Athena Ergane&quot; as the patron of craftsmen and artisans.  

She was often referred to with the epithet &quot;Παλλάς Αθηνά&quot; (Pallas Athena). [[Pallas]] was an ambiguous figure, sometimes male sometimes female, never imagined apart from Athena. She killed Pallas in a mistake, and ever after wore her/his goatskin fringed with [[chthonic]] serpents, as the protective [[aegis]].  With the epithet &quot;[[Athena Parthenos]]&quot; (&quot;virgin&quot;), Athena was worshipped at the [[Parthenon]].  With the epithet &quot;Athena Promachos&quot; she led in battle. With the epithet &quot;Athena Polias&quot; (&quot;of the city&quot;), Athena was the protectress of Athens and the Acropolis.

In the [[Homeric Hymns]] and in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', she is described with the curious epithet &quot;Tritogeneia.&quot;  The exact meaning of this term is unclear. It seems to mean &quot;[[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]-born,&quot; perhaps indicating that the sea-god was her father according to some early myths, or that she was born near Lake Triton in [[Africa]]. Another possible meaning is &quot;triple-born&quot; or &quot;third-born,&quot; which may refer to her status as the third daughter of Zeus.

==Episodes==

=== Erichthonius ===
According to [[Apollodorus]], [[Hephaestus]] attempted to [[rape]] Athena but was unsuccessful.  His [[semen]] fell on the ground, and [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]] was born from the earth. Athena then raised the baby as a foster mother. Alternatively, the semen landed on Athena's leg, and she wiped it off with a piece of wool which she tossed on the ground. Erichthonius arose from the ground and the wool. Another version says that Hephaestus wanted Athena to marry him but she disappeared on his bridal bed; he ejaculated onto the ground instead.  Athena gave three sisters, [[Herse]], [[Pandrosus]] and [[Aglaulus]] the baby in a small box and warned them to never open it. Aglaulus and Herse opened the box which contained the infant and future-king, Erichthonius. The sight caused Herse and Aglaulus to go insane and they threw themselves off the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]]. 

An alternative version of the same story is that while Athena was gone to bring a mountain to use in the Acropolis, the two willful sisters opened the box.  A crow witnessed the opening and flew away to tell Athena, who fell into a rage and dropped the mountain (now [[Mt. Lykabettos]]).  Once again, Herse and Aglaulus went insane and threw themselves to their deaths off a cliff.

Erichthonius later became [[King of Athens]] and implemented many beneficial changes to Athenian culture.  During this time, Athena frequently protected him.

=== Athens ===
Athena competed with [[Poseidon]] to be the patron deity of [[Athens, Greece|Athens]].  They agreed that each would give the Athenians one gift and the Athenians would choose whichever gift they preferred.  Poseidon struck the ground with his [[trident]] and a spring sprung up; the water was salty and not very useful, whereas Athena offered them the first domesticated [[olive tree]].  The Athenians (or their king, [[Cecrops]]) accepted the olive tree and along with it Athena as their patron, for the olive tree brought wood, oil and food.  This is thought to remember a clash between the inhabitants during [[Mycenae]]an times and newer immigrants.  It is interesting to note that Athens at its height was a significant sea power, defeating the [[Iran|Persia]]n fleet at the [[Battle of Salamis]] near [[Salamis Island]] in [[480 BC]]. Athena was also the patron goddess of several other cities, notably [[Sparta]].
In an alternate version, Poseidon invents the first horse.  Athena's gift is still chosen.

=== Arachne ===
A woman named Αράχνη ([[Arachne]]) once boasted that she was a superior weaver to Athena, the goddess of weaving.  Athena appeared to her disguised as an old woman and told Arachne to repent for her [[hubris]] but Arachne instead challenged Athena to a contest.  The old woman threw off her disguise and the contest began.  Athena wove a depiction of the conflict with Poseidon over Athens, while Arachne wove a depiction of Zeus' many romantic exploits.  Athena was furious at her skill (the contest was never decided) and her choice of subject. Enraged, she destroyed Arachne's work and struck the girl's head with the shuttle. As she could not bear to endure the pain, Arachne unsuccessfully tried to [[hanging|hang]] herself, but was transformed by Athena into the first [[spider]], which forever weaves its [[silk]] for food.

===Perseus and Medusa===
Athena guided [[Perseus (mythology)|Perseus]] in eliminating [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]], a dangerous unreformed relic of the old pre-Olympian order, and she was awarded the grisly trophy that turned men to stone, for her shield.

=== Heracles ===
Athena instructed [[Heracles]] how to remove the skin from the [[Nemean Lion]], by using the lion's own claws to cut through its thick hide.  The lion's hide became Heracles' signature garment, along with the olive-wood club he used in the battle. Athena also assisted Heracles on a few other labors.

She also helped Heracles defeat the [[Stymphalian Birds]], along with [[Hephaestus]].

=== [[Tiresias]] and [[Chariclo]] ===
Athena blinded [[Tiresias]] after he stumbled onto her bathing naked. His mother, [[Chariclo]], begged her to undo her curse, but Athena couldn't; she gave him prophecy instead.

== Miscellaneous ==
Athena (Minerva) is the subject of the $50 1915-S Panama-Pacific [[commemorative coin]]. At 2.5 troy oz (78 g) gold, this is the largest (by [[weight]]) coin ever produced by the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]]. This was the first $50 coin issued by the U.S. Mint and no higher was produced until the production of the $100 platinum coins in [[1997]]. Of course, in terms of face-value in adjusted dollars, the [[1915]] is the highest denomination ever issued by the U.S. Mint.

A [[Parthenon (Nashville)|full-scale replica of the Parthenon]] has stood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], which is known as the Athens of the South, for over a century.  In [[1990]], a great [[Athena Parthenos|replica of Phidias' statue]] of the goddess was added, over 41 feet (12.5 m) tall and gilded.

Athena had a childhood friend named Pallas. During one of their outings, Athena accidentally shot Pallas with an arrow, fatally wounding her. Athena then decided to put Pallas's name before hers so that Pallas would always be remembered.

Athena is also featured prominently in various modern pop culture creations including a Japanese animation called [[Saint Seiya]].  Saint Seiya was originally created by Japanese manga artist [[Masami Kurumada]].

Athena had been given birth by Zeus &quot;the father of gods&quot; and Metis. Zeus had been told that any children he had by Metis would be very powerful and someday dethrone him.

The '''Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game''' is a [[role-playing game]] created and written by [[Erick Wujcik]], set in the [[fictional universe]] created by author [[Roger Zelazny]] for his [[Chronicles of Amber]].  The game is unusual in that no [[dice]] are used in resolving conflicts or player actions; instead a simple system of comparative ability, and narrative description of the action by the players and [[gamemaster|game referee]], is used to determine how situations are resolved.  

Amber DRPG was created in the [[1980s]], and is much more focused on relationships and roleplaying than most of the roleplaying games of that era.  Most Amber characters are members of the two ruling classes in the Amber [[multiverse]], and are much more advanced in matters of strength, endurance, psyche, warfare and sorcery than ordinary beings.  This means that the only individuals who are capable of opposing a character are from his or her family, a fact that leads to much suspicion and intrigue.

==History==
The original 256-page game book was published in 1991 by [[Phage Press]], covering material from the first five novels (the &quot;[[The Chronicles of Amber#The Corwin Cycle|Corwin Cycle]]&quot;) and some details - sorcery and the [[Logrus]] - from the remaining five novels (the &quot;[[The Chronicles of Amber#The Merlin Cycle|Merlin Cycle]]&quot;), in order to allow players to roleplay characters from the Courts of Chaos.  Some details were changed slightly to allow more player choice - for example, players can be full Trump Artists without having walked the Pattern or the Logrus, which [[Merlin (The Chronicles of Amber)|Merlin]] says is impossible; and players' [[psychic]] abilities are far greater than those shown in the books.

[[Image:Shadow Knight.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of Shadow Knight]]
A  256-page companion volume, ''Shadow Knight'', was published in 1993.  book includes the remaining elements from the Merlin novels, such as Broken Patterns, and allows players to create Constructs such as Merlin's Ghostwheel.  The book presents the second series of novels not as additions to the series' [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] but as an example of a [[Campaign (role-playing games)|roleplaying campaign]] with Merlin, Luke, Julia, Jurt and Coral as the PCs.  The remainder of the book is a colection of essays on the game, statistics for the new characters and an update of the older ones in light of their appearance in the second series, and (perhaps most usefully for GMs) plot summaries of each of the ten books.  The book includes some material from the short story [[Amber Short Stories#The Salesman's Tale|The Salesman's Tale]], and some unpublished material from [[Prince of Chaos]], notably Coral's pregnancy by Merlin.

A third book, ''Rebma'', was promised and pre-orders were taken, but it never arrived, leading to accusations that it was [[vaporware]].  Wujcik also expressed a desire to create a book giving greater detail to the Courts of Chaos[http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=640].  However, the publishing rights to the Amber DRPG games were acquired in 2004 by [[Guardians of Order]], who took over sales of the game and announced their intention to release a new edition of the game, but since their restructuring no further news of the new edition has been forthcoming.  The two existing books have been made available as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] downloads (see [[#External links|External links]]).

==Setting==
{{main|The Chronicles of Amber}}

The game is set in the [[multiverse]] described in Zelazny's Chronicles of Amber.  The first book assumes that gamemasters will set their campaigns after the patternfall war; that is, after the end of the fifth book in the series, [[The Courts of Chaos]], but uses material from the following books to describe those parts of Zelazny's cosmology that were featured there in more detail.  Briefly, the Amber multiverse consists of '''Amber''', a city at one pole of the universe wherein is found [[the Pattern]], the symbol of [[Order]]; The '''Courts of Chaos''', an assembly of worlds at the other pole where can be found [[the Logrus]], the manifestation of [[Chaos]], and the Abyss, the source of all reality; and '''Shadow''', the collection of all possible [[universe]]s (shadows) between and around them.  Inhabitants of either pole can use one or both of the Pattern and the Logrus to travel through Shadow.

It is assumed that players will portray the children of the main characters from the books - the ruling family of Amber, known as the Elder Amberites - or a resident of the Courts.  However, since some feel that being the children of the main characters is too limiting, it is fairly common to either start with King Oberon's death ''before'' the book begins and roleplay the Elder Amberites as they vie for the throne; or to populate Amber from scratch with a different set of Elder Amberites.  The former option is one presented in the book; the latter is known in the Amber community as an &quot;[[Amethyst]]&quot; game.  A third option is to have the players portray [[Corwin (The Chronicles of Amber)|Corwin]]'s children, in an amber-like city built around Corwin's pattern; this is sometimes called an &quot;Argent&quot; game, since one of Corwin's heraldic colours is [[Silver]].

==System==
===Attributes===
Characters in Amber DRPG are represented by four [[attribute (role-playing games)|attributes]]: ''Psyche'', ''Strength'', ''Endurance''  and ''Warfare''.
*'''Psyche''' is used for feats of willpower or magic.
*'''Strength''' is used for feats of strength or unarmed combat.
*'''Endurance''' is used for feats of endurance.
*'''Warfare''' is used for armed combat, from duelling to commanding armies
The attributes run from -25 (normal human level), through -10 (normal level for a denizen of the Courts of Chaos) and 0 (normal level for an inhabitant of Amber), upwards without limit.  Scores above 0 are &quot;ranked&quot;, with the highest score being ranked 1st, the next-highest 2nd, and so on.  The character with 1st rank in each attribute is considered &quot;superior&quot; in that attribute, being considered to be substantially better than the character with 2nd rank even if the difference in scores is small.

====The Attribute Auction====
A character's ability scores are purchased during [[character generation]] in an [[auction]]; players get 100 [[character point]]s, and bid on each attribute in turn.  Unlike conventional auctions, bids are non-refundable; if one player bids 65 for psyche and another wins with a bid of 66, then the character with 66 is &quot;superior&quot; to the character with 65 even though there is only one bid difference.  After the auction, players can secretly pay extra points to raise their ranks, but they can only pay to raise their scores to an existing rank.  Further, a character with a bid-for rank is considered to have a slight advantage over character with a bought-up rank.

====Psyche in Amber DRPG compared to the Chronicles====
Characters with high psyche are presented as having strong [[telepathic]] abilities, being able to [[hypnotise]] and even mind-[[rape]] any character with lesser psyche with whom they can make eye-contact.  This is likely due to two scenes in the Chronicles: first, when [[Corwin (The Chronicles of Amber)|Corwin]] faces the demon Strygwalldir, it is able to wrestle mentally with him when their gazes meet; and second, when Fiona is able to keep Brand immobile in the final battle at the Courts of Chaos.  However, in general, the books only feature mental battles when there is some reason for mind-to-mind contact (for example, Trump contact) and magic is involved in both the above conflicts, so it is not clear whether Zelazny intended his characters to have such a power when it would have almost certainly assured Brand of victory.

===Powers===
Characters in Amber DRPG have access to the powers seen in the Chronicles of Amber: '''Pattern''', '''Logrus''', '''Shape-shifting''', '''Trump Artistry''', and magic.  A character who has walked the pattern can walk in shadow to any possible universe, and while there can manipulate probability.  A character who has mastered the Logrus can send out Logrus tendrils and pull themself or objects through shadow.  Shape-shifters can alter their physical form, and Trump Artists can create Trumps, a sort of [[tarot]] card which allows mental communication and travel.  Three types of magic are detailed: '''Power Words''', with a quick, small effect; '''Sorcery''', with pre-prepared spells as in many other game systems; and '''Conjuration''', the creation of small objects.  Each of the first three powers is available in an advanced form.

===Artifacts, Personal shadows and Constructs===
While a character with Pattern, Logrus or Conjuration can acquire virtually any object, players can choose to spend character points to obtain objects with particular virtues - unbreakability, or a mind of their own.  Since they have paid points for the items, they are a part of the character, and cannot lightly be destroyed.  Similarly, a character can find any possible universe, but they can spend character points to know of or inhabit shadows which are (in some sense) &quot;real&quot; and therefore useful.  The expansion, ''Shadow knight'', adds Constructs - artifacts with connections to shadows.

===Stuff===
Unspent character points become '''good stuff''' - a good luck for the character.  Players are also allowed to overspend (in moderation), with the points becoming '''bad stuff''' - bad luck which the Gamemaster should inflict on the character.  As well as representing luck, stuff can be seen as representing a character's outlook on the universe: characters with good stuff seeing the multiverse as a cheerful place, while characters with bad stuff see it as hostile.

===Conflict resolution===
In any given fair conflict between two characters, the character with the higher score in the relevant attribute will eventually win.  The key word here is ''fair'' - if characters' ranks are close, and the weaker character has obtained some advantage, then the weaker character can prevail.  This concept has been developed further in [[John Wick]]'s ''Advantage system''.  Alternatively, if characters' attribute ranks are close, the weaker character can try to change the relevant attribute by changing the nature of the conflict.  For example, if two characters are wrestling the relevant attribute is Strength; a character could reveal a weapon, changing it to Warfare; they could try to overcome the other character's mind using a power, changing it to Psyche; or they could concentrate their strength on defense, changing it to Endurance.  This concept is similar to the concept of ''escalation'' in [[Dogs in the Vineyard]].  If there is a substantial difference between characters' ranks, the conflict is generally over before the weaker character can react.

===The Golden Rule===
Amber DRPG advises gamemasters to change rules as they see fit - even to the point of adding or removing powers or attributes.

==Trivia==
The book features Trump portrait of each of the elder Amberites.  The trump picture of Corwin is executed in a subtly different style - and has features very similar to Roger Zelazny's.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alloy''' is a combination, either in [[solution]] or [[chemical compound|compound]], of two or more [[chemical element|elements]], which has a combination of at least one [[metal]], and where the resultant material has [[metallic]] properties.  An alloy with two components is called a binary alloy; one with three is a ternary alloy; one with four is a quaternary alloy.  The result is a metallic substance with properties different from those of its components.


Alloys are usually designed to have properties that are more desirable than those of their components.  For instance, [[steel]] is stronger than [[iron]], one of its main elements, and [[brass]] is more durable than [[copper]], but more attractive than [[zinc]].

Unlike pure metals, many alloys do not have a single [[melting point]].  Instead, they have a melting range in which the material is a mixture of [[solid]] and [[liquid]] phases.  The temperature at which melting begins is called the [[solidus]], and that at which melting is complete is called the [[liquidus]].  Special alloys can be designed with a single melting point, however, and these are called [[eutectic]] mixtures.

Sometimes an alloy is just named for the base metal, as 14 [[Carat (purity)|karat]] (58%) [[gold]] is an alloy of gold with other elements. The same holds for [[silver]] used in [[jewellery]], and [[aluminium]] used structurally.

The term &quot;alloy&quot; is frequently used in everyday speech as an alternative to &quot;aluminium alloy.&quot;  Many engineers find this convention offensive, since all steels and most other metals in practical use are also alloys.  A typical example of such usage is &quot;alloy wheels&quot; fitted to an automobile.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Articles of faith''' are formal [[creeds]], or lists of beliefs, sometimes numbered, and often beginning with &quot;We believe...&quot;, which attempt to more or less define the fundamental [[theology]] of a given [[religion]] and/or [[church]]. Articles of faith are common in both [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].

== Catholicism ==
The [[Nicene Creed]] and the shorter [[Apostles' Creed]] are articles, or professions of Faith said by members of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  The Nicene is predominantly recited during the Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] while the Apostle's is typically used for other occasions.

== Mormonism ==
{{main|Articles of Faith (Mormonism)}}
The ''Articles of Faith'' of [[Mormonism]] are a [[creed]] composed by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] as part of a [[1842]] [[The_Wentworth_Letter|letter]] sent to [[John Wentworth (mayor)|&quot;Long&quot; John Wentworth]], editor of the ''[[Chicago Democrat]]''. It is a concise listing of thirteen fundamental doctrines of [[Mormonism]].

Most [[Latter Day Saint]] denominations view the articles as an authoritative statement of basic theology. Some denominations, such as [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], have adopted the articles as scripture (see ''[[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)]]'').

== Protestantism ==
In [[Protestantism]], several denominations have articles of faith. The [[Anglican]] articles of faith are the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], which were issued by the Convocation of clergy of the [[Church of England]] in [[1571]]. These articles were adapted by [[John Wesley]] as the [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]], which are the defining articles of [[Methodism]].

== Islam ==
Traditionally, there are six basic beliefs of Muslims, of which include a belief in:
# Oneness of God
# Angels
# Prophets
# Scriptures
# [[Last Judgment|The Day of Judgment]] and the [[Akhirah]] or afterlife
# [[Predestination]]

In Sahih [[Al-Muslim]] and [[Al-Bukhari]], [[Muhammad]] explains, &quot;It (Al-Iman/faith) is to affirm your faith in Allah, [[Angels in Islam|His angels]], His Books [[Prophets of Islam|His Messengers]] and the Last Day, and to believe in the Divine Destiny whether it be good or bad.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the [[speculative fiction]] subgenre, see [[alternate history (fiction)]]

'''Alternative history''' or '''alternate history''' develops out of historiography to identify historical points of view that have been ignored, overlooked, or unseeable.  It usually denotes a [[history]] told from an alternative viewpoint, rather than from the view (actual or ascribed, obvious or inferred) of imperialists, conquerors or explorers.  For example ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'' offers a view sympathetic to people [[Native Americans (Americas)|indigenous to the Americas]], while the term ''[[Herstory]]'' was coined to denote history presented from a feminist perspective.

This falls into two major categories: 
* [[Historical revisionism]] is the reexamination of the accepted facts and interpretations of history, with an eye towards updating it with newly discovered, more accurate, less biased or differently biased information.
* When revisionism takes on a partisan tone, it is usually called [[Historical revisionism (political)|political historical revisionism]] i.e. a construction of past events which is refuted by well documented, verifiable, and very broadly accepted sources. Such histories may tend to blame their lack of scholarship or documentation on a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] to erase such evidence.

Other alternative histories include:
* The genre of speculative fiction includes the subgenre of [[Alternate history (fiction)|fictitious alternative history]], set in worlds in which history has diverged from history as it actually happened. The term [[uchronia]] refers to a hypothetical time period in such a divergent world.
* [[Failed history]] covers events that have been predicted and had items created in the expectation that they would occur, but then in fact did not occur. 
* [[Virtual history]] (also known as ''counterfactual history'') is a form of history which attempts to answer &quot;what if&quot; questions. It is an academic extrapolation of alternate outcomes of historical events.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Throughout history, forms of [[art]] have gone through periodic abrupt changes called '''artistic revolutions'''.  Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways.  See also [[cultural movement]]s. 

== Artistic revolution and cultural/political revolutions ==

The role of fine art has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful. So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society's changes due not to any prescenience, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their 'talent' of seeing.  

Artists have had to 'see' issues clearly in order to satisfy their current clients, yet not offend potential patrons. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 1600's when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind.

Examples of revoutionary art in conjunction with cultural/political movements:

*[[Trotskyist]] &amp; [[Diego Riveria]]
*[[Black Panther Party]] &amp; Emory Douglas
*Cuban [[Poster Art]]
*[[Social Realism]] &amp; [[Ben Shahn]]
*[[Feminist]] Art &amp; the [[Guerrilla Girls]]
*[[Industrial Workers of the World]] &amp; [[Woody Guthrie]]

== Artistic revolution of style ==

But not all artistic revolutions were political. Revolutions of style have also abruptly changed the art of a culture. For example, when the careful, even tedious, art techniques of French neo-classicism became oppressive to artists living in more exuberant times, a stylistic revolution known as &quot;[[Impressionism]]&quot; vitalized brush strokes and color. [[Degas]], [[Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] burst onto the French culture, effecting a revolution with a style that has become commonplace today.

An artistic revolution can be begun by a single artist, but unless that artist gains some understanding, he becomes an iconoclast. The first [[Abstract Expressionists]] were considered madmen to give up their brushes and rely on the sheer force of energy to leave an image, but then the import of atomic bombs, all atomic energy, became realized, and art found no better way of expressing its power.  [[Jackson Pollack]] is the artist best known for starting that revolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Agrarianism''' is a [[social philosophy|social ]] and [[political philosophy]].

In his introduction to his 1969 book ''Agrarianism in American Literature'', [[M. Thomas Inge]] defines '''''agrarianism''''' by the following basic tenets: 

*Cultivation of the soil provides direct contact with nature; through the contact with nature the agrarian is blessed with a closer relationship to God. Farming has within it a positive spiritual good; the farmer acquires the virtues of &quot;honor, manliness, [[self-reliance]], courage, moral integrity, and hospitality&quot; and  follows the example of God when creating order out of chaos. 

*The farmer  &quot;has a sense of identity, a sense of historical and religious tradition, a feeling of belonging to a concrete family, place, and region, which are psychologically and culturally beneficial.&quot; The harmony of this life checks the encroachments of a fragmented, alienated modern society  which has grown to inhuman scale. 

*In contrast, farming offers total independence and [[self-sufficiency]]. It has a solid, stable position in the [[world order]]. But urban life, [[capitalism]], and technology destroy our independence and dignity while fostering vice and weakness within us. The agricultural community can provide checks and balances against the imbalances of modern society by its fellowship of labor and cooperation with other agrarians, while obeying the rhythms of nature. The agrarian community is the model society for mankind. 

Agrarianism is not identical with the back to the earth movement, but it can be helpful to think of it in those terms.  The agrarian philosophy is not to get people to reject progress, but rather to concentrate on the fundamental goods of the earth, communities of more limited economic and political scale than in modern society, and on simple living--even when this shift involves questioning the &quot;progressive&quot; character of some recent social and economic developments. Thus agrarianism is not [[industrial farming]], with its specialization on products and industrial scale.

The name &quot;agrarian&quot; is properly applied to figures from [[Horace]] and [[Virgil]] through [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentals]] like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], the [[Southern Agrarians]] movement of the 1920s and 1930s (also known as the [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]] Agrarians) and present-day authors [[Wendell Berry]], [[Alan Carlson]], [[Victor Davis Hanson]], and Michael Bunker.  

In the 1910s and 1920s, agrarianism garnered significant popular attention, but was eclipsed in the  postwar period.  It revived somewhat in conjunction with the 1960s [[environmentalist movement]], and has been drawing an increasing number of adherents.  
 
Recent agrarian thinkers are sometimes referred to as neo-Agrarian.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This article is about angles in geometry. For other articles, see [[Angle (disambiguation)]]''

----

An '''Angle''' (from the Lat. ''angulus'', a corner, a diminutive, of which the primitive form, ''angus'', does not occur in Latin; cognate are the Lat. angere, to compress into a bend or to strangle, and the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|&amp;#7936;γκύλος}} ''(angulοs)'' crooked, curved; both connected with the Aryan or Indo-European root ''ank''-, to bend) is the figure formed by two [[Ray_(geometry)|rays]] sharing a common [[endpoint]], called the [[vertex]] of the angle.  Angles provide a means of expressing the difference in [[slope]] between two rays meeting at a vertex without the need to explicitly define the slopes of the two rays. Angles are studied in [[geometry]] and [[trigonometry]].

[[Euclid]] defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to [[Proclus]] an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by [[Eudemus]], who regarded an angle as a deviation from a straight line; the second by [[Carpus of Antioch]], who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative. 

==Units of measure for angles==
In order to measure an angle, a [[circle]] centered at the vertex is drawn. Since the circumference of a circle is always directly proportional to the length of its radius, the measure of the angle is independent of the size of the circle. Note that angles are dimensionless, since they are defined as the ratio of lengths.

*The ''[[radian]] measure'' of the angle is the length of the arc cut out by the angle, divided by the circle's radius. The [[SI]] system of units uses [[radian]]s as the (derived) unit for angles.  This is also roughly subdivided into the [[angular_mil|mil]], which has several definitions in practice.  Because of the relationship to arc length, radians are a special unit.  Sines and cosines whose argument is in radians have particular analytic properties, just as do exponential functions in the base ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''.  (As we've discovered, this is no coincidence).

*The ''[[degree (angle)|degree]] measure'' of the angle is the length of the arc, divided by the circumference of the circle, and multiplied by 360. The symbol for degrees is a small superscript circle, as in 360°. 2&amp;pi; radians is equal to 360° (a full circle), so one radian is about 57° and one degree is &amp;pi;/180 radians.  Degrees are further broken down into ''minutes of arc'' and ''seconds of arc'', which are 1/60th and 1/3600th of a degree, respectively.  Minutes of arc are commonly encountered in discussions of [[external ballistics]], as a minute of arc covers almost exactly 1 inch at 100 yards (1 m at 1200 m).  A [[rifle]] capable of shooting &quot;1 MOA&quot;, one minute of arc, can place all shots within 1 inch at 100 yards, 2 inches at 200 yards, etc.  Minutes of arc were also used in [[navigation]], and a [[nautical mile]] is roughly defined as one minute of arc of the earth's surface.

*The ''[[grad (angle)|grad]]'', also called grade, gradian or gon, is an angular measure where the arc is divided by the circumference, and multiplied by 400. It is used mostly in [[triangulation]].

*The ''point'' is used in [[navigation]], and is defined as 1/32 of a circle, or exactly 11.25°.

*The ''full circle'' or ''full [[Turn (geometry)|turn]]s'' represents the number or fraction of complete full turns. For example, &amp;pi;/2 radians = 90° = 1/4 full circle

==Conventions on measurement==

A convention universally adopted in mathematical writing is that angles given a sign are '''positive angles''' if measured [[Clockwise_and_counterclockwise|counterclockwise]], and '''negative angles''' if measured [[Clockwise_and_counterclockwise|clockwise]], from a given line. If no line is specified, it can be assumed to be the [[x-axis]] in the [[Cartesian plane]]. In [[navigation]], [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] are measured from north, increasing clockwise, so a bearing of 45 is north-east. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so north-west is 315.

In mathematics radians are assumed unless specified otherwise because this removes the arbitrariness of the number 360 in the degree system and because the [[trigonometric function]]s can be developed into particularly simple [[Taylor series]] if their arguments are specified in radians.

== Types of angles ==

An angle of  [[pi|&amp;pi;]]/2 radians or 90°, one-quarter of the full circle is called a '''right angle'''.

Two [[line segment]]s, rays, or lines (or any combination) which form a right angle are said to be either '''[[perpendicular]]''' or '''[[orthogonality|orthogonal]]''':

{|
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot; 
|[[Image:Right_angle.svg|thumb|134px|Right angle]]
|[[Image:Angle obtuse acute straight.svg|thumb|240px|Acute, obtuse, and straight angles (''a'', ''b'', ''c''). Here, ''a'' and ''b'' are [[Supplementary angles|supplement angles]].]]

| [[image:angle obtuse.png|thumb|200px|Obtuse angle]]
| [[image:angle straight.png|thumb|200px|Straight angle]]
--&gt;
*Angles smaller than a right angle are called '''acute angles''' (less than 90 degrees)
*Angles larger than a right angle are called '''obtuse angles''' (more than 90 degrees, less that 180).  
*Angles equal to two right angles are called '''straight angles''' (equal to 180 degrees).  
*Angles large than two right angles are called '''relex angles''' (more than 180 degrees).  

*The difference between an acute angle and a right angle is termed the '''complement''' of the angle
*The difference between an angle and two right angles is termed the '''supplement''' of the angle.

==Some facts==

In [[Euclidean geometry]], the inner angles of a [[triangle (geometry)|triangle]] add up to &amp;pi; radians or 180°; the inner angles of a [[quadrilateral]] add up to 2&amp;pi; radians or 360°. In general, the inner angles of a [[polygon|simple polygon]] with ''n'' sides add up to (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times; &amp;nbsp; &amp;pi; radians or (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp; &amp;times; &amp;nbsp;180°.

If two [[straight line]]s intersect, four angles are formed.  Each one has an equal measure to the angle across from it; these congruent angles are called vertical angles.

If a straight [[transversal line]] intersects two [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines,  corresponding (alternate) angles at the two points of intersection are equal; [[adjacent angles]] are [[supplementary angles|supplementary]], that is they add to &amp;pi; radians or 180°.

==A formal definition==
A Euclidean angle is completely determined by the corresponding right triangle.  In particular, if &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a Euclidean angle, it is true that

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}&lt;/math&gt; 

and

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

for two numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  So an angle can be legitimately given by two numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

To the ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt; there correspond two angles in the geometric range &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \theta &lt; 2\pi &lt;/math&gt;, since

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin \theta }{\cos \theta } = \frac{\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}}{\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}} = \frac{y}{x} =  \frac{-y}{-x} = \frac{\sin (\theta + \pi)}{\cos (\theta + \pi) } &lt;/math&gt;

==Angles in different contexts==

In the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean plane]], the angle &amp;theta; between two [[vector (spatial)|vector]]s '''u''' and '''v''' is related to their [[dot product]] and their lengths by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \cos(\theta)\ \|\mathbf{u}\|\ \|\mathbf{v}\|.&lt;/math&gt;

This allows one to define angles in any real [[inner product space]], replacing the Euclidean dot product · by the [[Hilbert space]] inner product &lt;·,·&gt;.

The angle between a line and a [[curve]] (mixed angle) or between two intersecting curves (curvilinear angle) is defined to be the angle between the [[tangent]]s at the point of intersection.  Various names (now rarely, if ever, used) have been given to particular cases:&amp;#8212;amphicyrtic (Gr. &amp;#7936;&amp;#956;&amp;#966;&amp;#8055;, on both sides, &amp;#954;&amp;#965;&amp;#961;&amp;#964;&amp;#8057;&amp;#963;, [[convex]]) or cissoidal (Gr. &amp;#954;&amp;#953;&amp;#963;&amp;#963;&amp;#8057;&amp;#963;, ivy), biconvex; xystroidal or sistroidal (Gr. &amp;#958;&amp;#965;&amp;#963;&amp;#964;&amp;#961;&amp;#8055;&amp;#963;, a tool for scraping), concavo-convex; amphicoelic (Gr. &amp;#954;&amp;#959;&amp;#8055;&amp;#955;&amp;#951;, a hollow) or angulus lunularis, biconcave.

Two intersecting [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] form an angle, called their '''[[dihedral angle]]'''. It is defined as the angle between two lines normal to the planes.

Also a plane and an intersecting line form an angle. This angle is equal to [[pi|&amp;pi;]]/2 radians minus the angle between the intersecting line and the line that goes through the point of intersection and is [[perpendicular]] to the plane. 

==Angles in Riemannian geometry==

In [[Riemannian geometry]], the [[metric tensor]] is used to define the angle between two [[tangent]]s.  Where ''U'' and ''V'' are tangent vectors and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are the components of the metric tensor ''G'',

:&lt;math&gt;
\cos \theta = \frac{g_{ij}U^iV^j}
{\sqrt{ \left| g_{ij}U^iU^j \right| \left| g_{ij}V^iV^j \right|}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Angles in astronomy==

In [[astronomy]], one can measure the ''angular separation'' of two [[star]]s by imagining two lines through the [[Earth]], each one intersecting one of the stars. 
Then the angle between those lines can be measured; this is the angular separation between the two stars. 

Astronomers also measure the [[apparent size]] of objects. 
For example, the [[full moon]] has an angular measurement of approximately 0.5°, when viewed from Earth. 
One could say, &quot;The Moon subtends an angle of half a degree.&quot; 
The [[small-angle formula]] can be used to convert such an angular measurement into a distance/size ratio.

==Angles in maritime navigation==

The modern format of angle used to indicate [[longitude]] or [[latitude]] is '''hemisphere degree minute.decimal''', where there are 60 minutes in a degree, for instance '''N 51 23.438''' or '''E 090 58.928'''.

The obsolete (but still commonly used) format of angle used to indicate [[longitude]] or [[latitude]] is '''hemisphere degree minute' second&quot;''', where there are 60 minutes in a degree and 60 seconds in a minute, for instance '''N 51 23&amp;prime;26&amp;Prime;''' or '''E 090 58&amp;prime;57&amp;Prime;'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Acoustics''' is a branch of [[physics]] and is the study of [[sound]], mechanical [[wave]]s in [[gas]]es, [[liquid]]s, and [[solid]]s. A [[scientist]] who works in the field of acoustics is an '''acoustician'''.  The application of acoustics in [[technology]] is called [[acoustical engineering]]. There is often much overlap and interaction between the interests of acousticians and acoustical engineers.

&quot;... acoustics is characterized by its reliance on combinations of physical principles drawn from other sources; and that the primary task of modern physical acoustics is to effect a fusion of the principles normally adhering to other sciences into a coherent basis for understanding, measuring, controlling, and using the whole gamut of vibrational phenomena in any material Phillip.&quot; ''Origins in Acoustics''. F.V. Hunt. Yale University Press, 1978

The main sub-disciplines of acoustics are

* [[Aeroacoustics]] is the study of  aerodynamic [[sound]], generated when a fluid flow interacts with a solid surface or with another flow. It has particular application to [[aeronautics]], examples being the study of sound made by jets and the physics of [[shock wave]]s ([[sonic boom]]s).

* [[Architectural acoustics]] is the study of how sound and buildings interact including the behavior of sound in [[concert hall]]s and auditoriums but also in office buildings, factories and homes. 

* [[Bioacoustics]] is the study of the use of sound by [[animal]]s such as [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[bat]]s.

* [[Biomedical acoustics]] is the study of the use of sound in [[medicine]], for example the use of [[ultrasound]] for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

* [[Loudspeaker acoustics]] is an engineering discipline behind the design of the [[loudspeaker]]

* [[Psychoacoustics]] is the study of how people react to sound, [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[perception]], and [[sound localization|localization]].

* [[Psychological Acoustics]] is the study of the mechanical, electrical and biochemical function of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] in living organisms. 

* [[Physical acoustics]] is the study of the detailed interaction of sound with materials and fluids and includes, for example, [[sonoluminescence]] (the emission of light by bubbles in a liquid excited by sound) and [[thermoacoustics]] (the interaction of sound and heat).

* [[Speech communication]] is the study of how [[speech]] is produced, the analysis of speech signals and the properties of speech transmission, storage, recognition and enhancement. 

* [[Vibration acoustics]] ''Structural Acoustics and Vibration'' is the study of how sound and mechanical structures interact; for example, the transmission of sound through walls and the [[radiation of sound]] from [[vehicle]] panels.

* [[Ultrasonics]] is the study of high [[frequency]] sound, beyond the range of human hearing. 

* [[Wolffian Acousitics]] is the study of salient features of pediatric ultrasound insofar as it reviews technologic factors, technique, and the normal anatomy used to evaluate the pediatric tract for abnormality.

* [[Musical acoustics]] is the study of the physics of [[musical instruments]]

* [[Underwater acoustics]] is the study of the [[propagation of sound]] in the [[ocean]]s.  Closely associated with [[sonar]] research and development.

* [[Acoustic engineering]] is the study of how sound is generated and measured by [[loudspeaker]]s, [[microphone]]s, [[sonar projector]]s, [[hydrophone]]s, [[ultrasonic transducer]]s, [[sensor]]s, [[Electro Acoustics]], and all other topics on this list. (see external links)

A sound wave is characterized by its speed, its [[wavelength]] and its amplitude. The [[speed of sound]] depends on the medium through which the sound travels and also depends on [[temperature]] and not on the air pressure. The speed of sound is about 340 m/s in air and 1500 m/s in water. The wavelength is the distance from one wave peak to the next. The wavelength, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of a sound wave is related to the speed of sound &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and its frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by 
:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
&lt;/math&gt;.
== Sound pressure level (SPL)==

The [[amplitude]] of a sound wave is usually characterized by its [[sound pressure]]. In a normal working environment, a very wide range of [[pressure]]s can occur and it is therefore a convention that sound pressure is measured on a [[logarithmic scale]] using the [[Decibel#Acoustics|decibel]]. If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[root mean square|rms]] sound pressure amplitude then the [[sound pressure level]] (SPL) is defined as 20 times the logarithm of the ratio of the pressure to some reference pressure.

'''[[Sound pressure level]] SPL''' is calculated in [[decibel]]s as
:&lt;math&gt;
L_p =20\, \log_{10}\left(\frac{p_1}{p_0}\right)=10\, \log_{10}\left(\frac{p_1^2}{p_0^2}\right)\mbox{ dB} SPL
&lt;/math&gt;

The reference sound pressure in air is by convention the [[threshold of hearing]]:

:&lt;math&gt;p_0 = 2 \cdot 10^{-5} \mbox{ Pa}&lt;/math&gt;

:'''= 20 µPa in air and 1 µPa in water. (Pa = [[pascal]] = N / m²; N = [[newton]])'''

When speaking of sound levels, one must be sure to differentiate between [[sound pressure level]]s and sound power levels. Sound pressure levels are recorded by [[microphone]]s and other devices. This is a measurement of the amount of pressure in the air being sensed at a given location. It follows that its value can be determined through direct experimentation. In comparison, sound [[power (physics)|power]] levels are a measurement of the actual [[energy]] being put into use by a given device to create [[noise (environmental)|noise]]. Because of environmental factors, and other influences, the amount of energy a device devotes to creating sound may not be equal to the actual level of the sound as it's perceived. It can be useful to express sound pressure in this way when dealing with [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], as the perceived loudness of a sound correlates roughly logarithmically to its sound pressure. Both microphones and eardrums respond to the sound pressure level. They cannot convert the [[sound intensity]]. Sound power measurements cannot be directly measured, and must be inferred through other data.

==Measurement methods==

There are two popular ways for scientists to perform sound power level measurements. They include a &quot;direct method&quot;, and a &quot;comparison method&quot;. The direct method computes sound power levels by computing an equation of environmental factors (such as room [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[reverberation]] time, etc.) and sound pressure levels. A more precise implementation of this method can be found in the [[ISO3745]] acoustics standard. The comparison method however, is conducted by measuring sound pressure levels from a [[reference]] sound source which emits a known, constant, sound power level, and then comparing that level with the sound pressure level of the object being recorded. Each way is equally valid and accurate.

==Reverberation and anechoic rooms==

Experiments such as the two methods mentioned above are sometimes performed in [[reverberation room]]s, or in some cases, [[anechoic room]]s. The design of a reverberation room is to create long lasting reflections, or [[echo (phenomenon)|echo]]es, of sound waves. This helps create a highly averaged and [[omnidirectional]] sound level throughout the entire chamber. A typical example of rooms with characteristics similar to reverberation rooms are concrete tunnels, caves, etc. Anechoic rooms, such as [[hemi-anechoic]] rooms, or fully anechoic rooms are created to simulate what is called a ''[[free field]]''. A free field is the representation of a theoretical [[infinite space]], in which no sound wave [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]s, or echoes, take place. In rooms such as these, the only sounds which exist are being emitted directly from the source, and are not reflected from another part of the chamber. Anechoic rooms have the characteristic of being muted and muffled.

==Helmholtz resonator==

A Helmholtz resonator is a container with an open hole or neck.
It is sometimes used as a passive noise control device.
It behaves essentially as a mass-spring-damper system, and its resonant frequency can be calculated as follows:

*''f'' = resonant frequency
*''s'' = speed of sound in air
*''r'' = radius of neck
*''a'' = area of neck
*''l'' = length of neck
*''L''&amp;prime; = effective length of neck
:''L''&amp;prime; = ''l'' + 1.7''r'' (outer end flanged)
:''L''&amp;prime; = ''l'' + 1.4''r'' (outer end unflanged)
*''v'' = volume
:&lt;math&gt;f = (s/2 \pi)(\sqrt{a/(L' \cdot v)})&lt;/math&gt;

(A container with a hole, rather than a neck, behaves as being flanged, with a neck length of 0.)

The Helmholtz resonator is an example of the [[lumped component]] model of acoustic systems which is useful when the [[wavelength]] of interest is significantly larger than the physical dimensions of the system.

Familiar examples of Helmholtz resonators include blowing across the top of a bottle, [[whistling]], and the [[ocarina]].

==Rectangular boxes==

*''f'' = frequency of standing wave of a rectangular box
*''s'' = speed of sound in air
*''x'', ''y'', ''z'' = dimensions of box
*''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; = any integers
:&lt;math&gt;f = (s/2)(\sqrt{(N_x/x)^2+(N_y/y)^2+(N_z/z)^2})&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Atomic physics''' (or '''atom physics''') is the field of [[physics]] that studies the [[electron]] hull of [[atom]]s.

Lay people often associate the term ''atomic physics'' with [[nuclear power]] and [[nuclear bomb]]s, obviously due to the [[synonym]]ous use of ''atomic'' and ''nuclear'' in [[standard English]]. However, physicists distinguish between atomic physics (dealing with the effects of the [[electron]] hull and the nucleus's overall [[Spin_(physics)|spin]] and [[electric charge]]) and [[nuclear physics]] (dealing with the forces within [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and reactions that alter, fuse or split them).

The beginning of atomic physics is marked by the discovery and scrutinious study of [[spectral line]]s. These are sharply defined lines in the spectrum of illuminated or (hot, hence ionized (see [[flame]]) and hence) light-emitting free atoms. (&quot;Free&quot; meaning that they are a [[gas]] or [[vapour]] and therefore not close to or interacting with other atoms.)

The study of these lines led to the [[Bohr atom model]] and on to our present understanding of the electron hull of the atom as described by the [[atomic orbital model]] which is the basis of all understanding of [[chemistry]]. These conclusions are, however, not at all straightforward, but rather were required by more than a century of research, which has succeeded in putting chemistry on a sound fundament but also gave rise to many other applications.

'''American Sign Language''' ('''ASL''', also '''Amslan''' obs., '''Ameslan''' obs.) is the dominant [[sign language]] in the [[United States]], [[anglophone|English-speaking]] [[Canada]], and parts of [[Mexico]], used particularly in the [[Deaf community]]. Although the United Kingdom and the United States share English as a spoken language, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) is quite different from ASL, and not mutually intelligible. 

ASL is also used (sometimes alongside indigenous sign languages) in the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]], [[Chad]], [[Gabon]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Mauritania]], [[Kenya]], [[Madagascar]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. Like other sign languages, its [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] are distinct from any [[spoken language]] in its area of influence. While there has been no reliable survey of the number of people who use ASL as their primary language, estimates range from 500,000 to 2 million in the U.S.A. alone [http://library.gallaudet.edu/dr/faq-asl-rank.html]. American Sign Language has been said (by Trudy Suggs in her book) to be the third-most-used language in America after English and Spanish.

==History of ASL==
In the [[United States]], as in most of the world, hearing families with deaf children often employ ad-hoc [[home sign]] for simple communications. Today though, ASL classes are offered in many secondary and postsecondary schools. ASL is a language distinct from spoken English—replete with its own syntax and grammar and supporting its own culture. The origin of modern ASL is ultimately tied to the confluence of many events and circumstances, including historical attempts at [[deaf education]]; possibly the sign used by the indigenous nations of North America; the unique situation present on a small island in Massachusetts; the attempts of a father to enlist a local minister to help educate his deaf daughter; and in no small part the ingenuity and genius of people (in this case deaf people) for language itself.

Standardized sign languages have been used in Italy since the [[17th century]] and in France since the [[18th century]] for the instruction of the deaf. [[Old French Sign Language]] was developed and used in [[Paris]] by the [[Abbé de l'Épée]] in his school for the deaf. These languages were always modeled after the natural sign languages already in use by the deaf cultures in their area of origin, often with additions to show aspects of the grammar of the local spoken languages. 

American Plains Indians used [[Plains Indian Sign Language]] as an [[interlanguage]] for communication between people/tribes not sharing a common spoken language; its influence on ASL, if any, is unknown. 

Off the coast of [[Massachusetts]], on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]] in the 18th century, the population had a much higher rate of deafness than the general population of the continental United States because of the [[founder effect]] and the island's isolation. [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]] was well known by almost all islanders since so many families had deaf members. It afforded almost everyone the opportunity to have frequent contact with ASL while at an age most conducive to effortlessly learning a language. 

Congregationalist minister and deaf educator [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] is credited with popularizing the signing technique in North America. At the behest of a father who was interested in educating his deaf daughter, [[Alice Cogswell]], he was enlisted to investigate methods of teaching the deaf. In the early 1800s he visited the Abbé de l'Épée's school in Paris and convinced one of the teachers, [[Laurent Clerc]], to return with him to America. In [[1817]] they founded the American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb (now the [http://www.asd-1817.org/ American School for the Deaf]), in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], to teach sign language to American deaf students.

It was at this school that all these influences would intermingle, interact and what would become ASL was born. Many of the school's students were from Martha's Vineyard, and they mixed their &quot;native&quot; sign language with Clerc's OFSL. Other students probably brought their own highly localized sign language or &quot;home sign&quot; systems to the mix. Undoubtedly, spontaneous lexicon developed at the school as well. If there was any influence from sign language of [[Native American|indigenous people]], it may have been here that it was absorbed into the language. 

Interestingly, because of the early influence of the sign language of France upon the school, the vocabularies of ASL and modern  [[French Sign Language]] are approximately 60% shared, whereas ASL and [[British Sign Language]], for example, are almost completely dissimilar.

From its synthesis at this first public school for the deaf in North America, the language went on to grow. Many of the graduates of this school went on to found schools of their own in many other states, thus spreading the methods of Gallaudet and Clerc and serving to expand and standardize the language; as with most languages though, there are regional variations.

After being strongly established in this country there was a bitter fight between those who supported [[oralism]] over [[manualism]] in the late 1800s. Many notable individuals of high standing contributed to this row, such as [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. The oralists won many battles and for a long time the use of sign was suppressed, socially and pedagogically. Many considered sign to not even be a language at all. This situation was changed by [[William Stokoe]], a professor of English hired at [[Gallaudet University]] in 1955. He immediately became fascinated by ASL and began serious study of it. Eventually, through publication in linguistics journals of articles containing detailed linguistic analysis of ASL, he was able to convince the scientific mainstream that ASL was indeed a natural language on a par with any other.

The language continues to grow and change like any living language. In particular, ASL constantly adds new signs in an attempt to keep up with constantly changing technology.

==Linguistics==
ASL is a [[natural language]] as proved to the satisfaction of the linguistic community by [[William Stokoe]], and contains [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[semantics]], [[syntax]] and [[pragmatics]] just like [[spoken languages]]. It is a [[manual language]] meaning that the information is expressed not with combinations of sounds but with combinations of handshapes, palm orientations, movements of the hands, arms and body, and facial expressions. It is used natively and predominantly by the [[Deaf]] and [[hard-of-hearing]] of the United States and Canada.

===Iconicity===
Although it often seems as though the signs are meaningful of themselves, in fact they can be as arbitrary as words in spoken language. For example, hearing children often make the mistake of using &quot;you&quot; to refer to themselves, since others refer to them as &quot;you.&quot; Children who acquire the sign YOU (pointing at one's interlocutor) make similar mistakes&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; they will point at others to mean themselves, indicating that even something as seemingly explicit as pointing is an arbitrary sign in ASL, like words in a spoken language.

However, Edward Klima and Ursula Bellugi have modified the common theory that signs can be self-explanatory by grouping signs into three categories:

*Transparent: Non-signers can usually correctly guess the meaning
*Translucent: Meaning makes sense to non-signers once it is explained
*Opaque: Meaning cannot be guessed by non-signers

Klima and Bellugi used American Sign Language in formulating that classification. The theory that signs are self-explanatory can be conclusively disproved by the fact that non-signers cannot understand fluent, continuous sign language. The majority of signs are opaque.

Generally, signs that are &quot;Transparent&quot; are signs of objects or words that became popular after the basics of ASL were established. There are, of course, exceptions to this.

===Grammar===
The grammar of ASL uses spatial locations, motion, and context to indicate [[syntax]]. For example:

* The primary sentence structure in ASL is Topic-Comment and Object-Subject-Verb. For example, in the sentence &quot;I want the book,&quot; I is the subject, ''Book'' is the object, and ''want'' is the verb. The sentence, therefore, would be signed as &quot;BOOK, ME WANT.&quot; To add a time element, such as &quot;I want the book tomorrow&quot;, the time component is placed at the beginning of the sentence, making it look like this: &quot;TOMORROW BOOK ME WANT.&quot; In addition, [[prosody]] can alter sentence structure.

* ASL also relies heavily on Time Sequenced Ordering. Since ASL is a visual language, when signing a sentence or a story one signs it in the order in which events occurred. For example, in the case of the sentence &quot;I'm going to be late tonight because my boss handed me a huge stack of work after lunch,&quot; one would sign &quot;LUNCH FINISH, BOSS GIVE-ME BIG-STACK WORK, WILL ARRIVE LATE.&quot; In the case of stories, however, Time Sequenced Ordering can be a little more malleable since one could choose to sign information either in the order in which events occurred or in the order in which one found out about events.

* If a signer signs a noun and then points to a certain spot, he or she can refer back to that noun by pointing again to the same spot. This is also known as ''setting up'' something. For instance, if you point to a spot over your right shoulder in talking about your grandmother in another city, then when you mention her again, instead of signing &quot;GRANDMOTHER,&quot; you can just point back to the same spot.

* Within ASL there is a class of ''directional'' verbs. These include the signs for ''pay'', ''give'', ''show'', ''invite'', ''send'', and several others. Depending on which way the hand moves, either away from the body or towards, distinguishes between the subject and object of the sentence, which are both included within the one sign. For example, to sign &quot;I GIVE YOU&quot;, the hand in the shape of a flattened &quot;O&quot; moves away from the signer's body. In signing &quot;YOU GIVE ME&quot; the same handshape is drawn toward the body.  

* To intensify the meaning of a verb or adjective (e.g., to say &quot;very calm&quot; instead of &quot;calm&quot;), the signer modulates the way it is expressed. Certain short words, such as &quot;sad&quot; or &quot;mad&quot; might be fingerspelled rather than signed. Other words can be repeated or slowed down, emphasizing their importance or degree. Some signs may be enlarged, so that they take up more body space. This can also involve a back and forth scissoring motion of the arms to indicate that the sign ought to be larger, but one is physically incapable of stretching the arms any farther than they already are. Moving the whole body and adding facial expressions are also useful modifiers.

* Raised eyebrows can indicate a yes-or-no question, while lowered eyebrows indicate a 'wh-question' or one that requests more information such as those that would use the question words: who, what, when, where, or why.

* To ask a rhetorical question, the eyebrows are raised to give the cue not to reply. Such as, &quot;I don't like [what?] (raised eyebrows), garlic&quot;.

* Like some spoken languages, ASL does not use the linking verb &quot;to be&quot; (either as a '[[copula]]' or a [[auxiliary verb|helping verb]]). An example of a copula is the English phrase &quot;My hair is wet&quot;, which when translated into ASL would be transliterated as, &quot;MY HAIR, WET&quot;. (The comma indicates a short pause and raised eyebrow to topicalize &quot;my hair&quot;.) An example of a helping verb is translating the English phrase &quot;We are going to the store tomorrow&quot;, some possible ASL sentences, literally translated, could be
**&quot;TOMORROW, STORE WE GO.&quot; (Topicalization, TOMORROW is the focus) 
**&quot;STORE, WE GO TOMORROW.&quot; (Topicalization, STORE is the focus)

* In ASL, a signer might not use the word &quot;because&quot;, but instead break down the sentence into a [[rhetorical question]]. This is often used for clarity or emphasis. For instance, &quot;I love to eat [[pasta]] because I am [[Italian people|Italian]]&quot; would be translated into &quot;I LOVE EAT PASTA, WHY? I ITALIAN.&quot; Rhetorical questions do not replace the word &quot;because&quot;. Rather, they are used only when the speaker deems it necessary.

* Some signs can be executed in different locations for contextual reasons. The sign for &quot;PAIN&quot; - two pointed index fingers aimed at each other moved towards then away from each other - can be signed over one's leg to show that there is pain in the leg, or over the belly to indicate abdominal pain.

* Facial expression is also key in ASL. In signing &quot;ANGRY&quot;, a facial expression of anger should be put on. Without expressions like this, the effect would be similar to listening to someone who was speaking in extremely monotone spoken English, or it would be taken as an indication of sarcasm or some other departure from the usual meaning of the sign.

* ASL also makes use of mouth morphemes, certain sounds or mouth configurations that add meaning to a sign. For example, one could sign &quot;HE TALL&quot; and communicate that a man is reasonably tall, but by adding the mouth morpheme &quot;Cha,&quot; the sentence would then be understood as &quot;He's ENORMOUS!!!&quot;

==Writing systems==

ASL is often glossed with English words written in all capital letters. This is however a method used simply to teach the structure of the language. ASL is a visual language not a written language. There is no one-to-one correspondence between words in ASL and English, and much of the inflectional modulation of ASL signs is lost.

There are two true writing systems in use for ASL: a [[phoneme|phonemic]] [[Stokoe notation]], which has a separate symbol or diacritic mark for every phonemic hand shape, motion, and position (though it leaves something to be desired in the representation of facial expression), and a more popular iconic system called [[SignWriting]], which represents each sign with a rather abstract illustration of its salient features. SignWriting is commonly used for student newsletters and similar purposes.

==&quot;Baby Sign&quot;==
{{main|Baby Sign}}
In recent years, it has been shown that exposure to sign language has a positive impact on the socialization of hearing children.  When infants are taught to sign, parents are able to converse with them at a [[Child development|developmental stage]] when they are not yet capable of producing verbal speech, which requires fine control of both breathing and the vocal tract. The ability of a child to actively communicate earlier than would otherwise be possible appears to accelerate language development and to decrease the frustrations of communication.

Many parents use a collection of simplified or ''ad hoc'' signs called &quot;baby sign&quot;, as infants do not have the dexterity required for true ASL. However, parents can learn to recognize their baby's approximations of adult ASL signs, just as later on they will learn to recognize their approximations of verbal language, so teaching an infant ASL is also possible. Typically young children will make an ASL sign in the correct location and use the correct hand motion, but may be able only to approximate the handshape, for example, using one finger instead of three in signing ''water''.

==Primate usage==
ASL has allegedly been taught to both species of [[chimpanzee]], the [[bonobo]] and [[common chimpanzee]], as well as to [[gorilla]]s. Several of the animals have been said to have mastered more than one hundred signs, though not all agree with the ability of the [[primate]]s to sign. For example, when the [[washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] research team asked the handlers of the chimp to write signs down whenever they witnessed them being produced by Washoe, the hearing people on the team turned in long lists of signs while the only deaf [[native speaker]] of ASL on the team turned in blank lists, explaining that what she saw were not signs at all, but simply gestures.  Further fomenting the controversy, the researchers in the studies of [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] and Washoe refused to share their raw data with the [[scientific community]]. The theory that non-human primates have learned ASL, or that they are even capable of learning ASL or any other natural language, is not currently accepted by linguists&amp;mdash;including linguists who accept similar but better documented claims of rudimentary human language acquisition by birds. Despite this, however, research on the ability of primates to learn symbol systems continues and receives occasional publicity in the media.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''applet''' is a software component that runs in the context of another program, for example a [[web browser]]. An applet usually performs a very narrow function that has no independent use. Hence, it is an ''app''lication ''[[-let]]''. The term was introduced in [[AppleScript]] in 1993.  An applet is distinguished from &quot;subroutine&quot; by several features.  First, it executes only on the &quot;client&quot; platform environment of a system, as contrasted from &quot;servlet.&quot;  As such, an applet provides functionality or performance beyond the default capabilities of its container (the browser).  Also, in contrast with a subroutine, certain capabilities are restricted by the container. An applet is written in a language that is different from the scripting or [[HTML]] language which invokes it.  The applet is written in a compiled language, while the scripting language of the container is an interpreted language, hence, the greater performance or functionality of the applet.  Unlike a &quot;subroutine,&quot; a complete web component can be implemented as an applet.

== Attributes ==

Unlike a [[program]], an applet cannot run independently; an applet usually features display and graphics and often interacts with the human user. However, they are usually stateless and have restricted security privileges.  The applet must run in a [[container]], which is provided by a host program, through a [[plugin]], or a variety of other applications including mobile devices that support the applet programming model.

== Interfaces ==

Applets usually have some form of [[user interface]] or perform a particular piece of the overall user interface in a web page.  This distinguishes them from a program written in a [[scripting programming language]] (such as [[JavaScript]]) that also runs in the context of a larger, client program, but which would not be considered an applet.

Applets generally have the capability of interacting with and/or influencing their host program, through the restricted security privileges, although they are generally not required to do so.

== Examples ==

Common examples of applets are [[Java applet]]s and [[SWF|Flash movies]]. Another example is the [[Windows Media Player]] applet that is used to display embeded video files in [[Internet Explorer]] (and other [[Web browser|browsers]] that support the plugin). Some plugins also allow for displaying various 3D model formats in a web browser, via an applet that allow the view of the model to be rotated and zoomed. Many [[browser game]]s are applet-based, though some may develop into fully functional applications that require installation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Speculative fiction}}
'''Alternate history''' or '''alternative history''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[speculative fiction]] (or some would say of [[science fiction]]), that is set in a world in which [[history]] has [[Point of divergence|diverged]] from history as it is generally known; more simply put, alternate history asks the question, &quot;What If history had developed differently?&quot; Most works that employ this rubric are set in factful historical contexts, yet feature several social, geopolitical or industrial circumstances that developed differently or at a different pace from our own, sometimes as a result of [[progress]] in [[technology|technological]] or [[society|social]] [[paradigms]] that were accomplished via the understanding already present in the given [[zeitgeist]]. While to some extent all [[fiction]] can be described as alternate history, the subgenre proper comprises fiction in which a change happens that causes history to diverge from our own. 

Since the 1950s this type of fiction has to a large extent merged with science fictional framings involving (a) cross-time, or paratime, travel between alternate histories/universes (or some kind of psychic awareness of the existence of &quot;our&quot; universe by the people in the other, as in Nabokov and Dick; see below); or (b) ordinary voyaging uptime or downtime that results in a world splitting into two or more new timelines.  So close have the cross-time, time-splitting and alternate history themes been interwoven that it is impossible to discuss them fully apart from one another. Thus, cross-time and time-splitting stories will be an important part of this article &lt;i&gt;insofar as they portray one or more alternate histories that diverged from a common past&lt;/i&gt;.

In [[French (language)|French]], alternate history novels are called ''uchronie''. This [[neologism]] is based on the word ''utopia'' (a place that doesn't exist) and the Greek for time, ''chronos''. An ''uchronie'', then, is defined as a time that doesn't exist.

== History of alternate history fiction ==

=== Antiquity ===
The earliest example of alternate history appears to be Book IX, sections 17-19, of [[Livy]]'s ''History of Rome from Its Foundation''. He contemplates the possibility of [[Alexander the Great]] expanding his father's empire westward instead of eastward and attacking Rome in the [[4th century BC]].

=== 19th century === 
The earliest alternate history published as a complete work, rather than an aside or digression in a longer work, is believed to be [[Louis Napoléon Geoffroy-Château]]'s French nationalist tale, ''Napoléon et la conquête du monde, 1812-1823'' ([[1836]]) &amp;ndash; in English ''Napoleon and the Conquest of the World''. In this book, Geoffroy-Château postulates that [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] turns away from [[Moscow]] before the disastrous winter of [[1812]]. Without the severe losses he suffered historically, Napoleon is able to conquer the world. Geoffroy-Château's book must have been popular in [[France]], for the subsequent years saw many similar novels published.

In the [[English language]], the first known complete alternate history is [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s [[short story]] &quot;P.'s Correspondence&quot;, published in [[1846]] and which recounts the tale of an apparent madman and his purported encounters with various literary and political figures of the 1840s. At novel length, the first alternate history in English would seem to be [[Castello Holford]]'s ''Aristopia'' ([[1895]]). While not as nationalistic as ''Napoléon et la conquête du monde, 1812-1823'', ''Aristopia'' is another attempt to portray a utopian society which never existed. In ''Aristopia'', the earliest settlers in [[Virginia]] discover a reef made of solid [[gold]] and are able to build a [[Utopia|utopian]] society in [[North America]].

=== Early 20th century and the era of the pulps=== 

Although a number of alternate history stories and novels appeared in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the next major work is perhaps the strongest anthology of alternate history ever assembled. In [[1932]], British historian [[Sir John Squire]] collected a series of essays, many of which could be considered stories, in ''If It Had Happened Otherwise'' from some of the leading historians of the period. In this work, scholars from major universities as well as important non-university-based authors turned their attention to such questions as &quot;If the Moors in Spain Had Won&quot; and &quot;If [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] Had Had an Atom of Firmness.&quot;
The essays range from serious scholarly efforts through [[Henrik Van Loon]]'s fanciful and satiric portrayal of an independent 20th century Dutch city state on the island of Manhattan.

Four of the fourteen pieces examined the two most popular themes in alternate history prior to the [[World War II|Second World War]]: Napoleon's victory and the [[American Civil War]]. One of the entries in Squire's volume was [[Winston Churchill]]'s &quot;If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg&quot;, written from the viewpoint of a historian in a world where the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] had won the [[American Civil War]], considering what would have happened if the North &lt;!-- Please do not change this, North is correct --&gt; had been victorious. (This kind of speculative work which posts from the point of view of an alternate history is variously known as a &quot;recursive alternate history&quot;, a &quot;double-blind what-if&quot; or an &quot;alternate-alternate history&quot;.) Other authors appearing in Squire's book included [[Hilaire Belloc]] and [[André Maurois]].

Another example of alternate history from this period (and arguably the first to explicitly posit cross-time travel from one universe to another as anything more than a visionary experience) was [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923) in which several British politicians are transferred via an accidental encounter with a cross-time machine into an alternate universe in which Britain had changed course in earlier centuries and developed into a seemingly pacifistic and utopian society. When the politicians from our world try to seize power, the utopians simply point a ray gun at them and send them on to someone else's universe. Wells works out the entire multiverse-pancake framing complete with paratime travel machines that would become popular with U.S. pulp writers (see below), but since his hero experiences only a single alternate world this story is not very different from conventional alternate history (the intruders from our world cause no significant change in the world they enter and are really just a device for examining the results of a past divergence between Wells' utopia and our own world). 

The 1930s would see alternate history move into a new arena. The December [[1933]] issue of ''[[Astounding (magazine)|Astounding]]'' published [[Nat Schachner]]'s &quot;Ancestral Voices&quot;. This was quickly followed by [[Murray Leinster]]'s &quot;Sidewise in Time&quot;. While earlier alternate histories examined reasonably straight-forward divergences, Leinster attempted something completely different. In his &quot;world gone mad&quot;, pieces of Earth traded places with their analogs from different timelines. The story follows [[Robinson College (fictitious)|Robinson College]] Professor Minott as he wanders through these analogs, each of which features remnants of worlds which followed a different history.

=== Time travel as a means of creating historical divergences ===

This period also saw the publication of the [[time travel]] novel ''[[Lest Darkness Fall]]'' by [[L. Sprague de Camp]], which was similar to [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' but sent an American academic to the [[Italy]] of the [[Ostrogoths]] at the time of the Byzantine invasion led by [[Belisarius]].  De Camp's work is concerned with the historical changes wrought by his time traveler, Martin Padway, thereby making the work an alternate history. Padway is depicted as making permament changes and implicitly forming a new time branch (in contrast to Twain's hero, who ultimately fails, with the result that history reverts to its &quot;normal&quot; course).

Time travel as the cause of a point of divergence (creating two histories where before there was one, or simply replacing the future that existed before the time traveling event) has continued to be a popular theme over the decades. In [[Bring the Jubilee]], by [[Ward Moore]], the hero, who lives in a backward world in which the South won the Civil War, travels through time and brings about an alternate history in which the North won at Gettysburg. [[Ray Bradbury]]'s [[A Sound of Thunder]] creates a scenario in which the time travelers inadvertently destroy all history as we know it.

When a story's assumptions about the nature of time necessitate, as in the Bradbury tale, a replacement of the visited historical time's future rather than just the creation of a new time line, the next step is obviously the founding of a time patrol (a device that is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to be confused with the paratime police, see below). Such an agency has the grim task of saving civilization every day, every hour, with patrol members--depicted most notably in [[Poul_Anderson#Time_Patrol|Poul Anderson's Time Patrol]]--racing uptime and downtime to preserve the &quot;correct&quot; history.

Of course not all time travel stories involve alternate histories.  The writer may ignore the possibility of change, or have the cause-and-effect work out so that the time traveler's actions cause the future he remembers, as in [[Harry Harrison]]'s [[Technicolor Time Machine]].

=== The Connecticut Yankee wins at last! ===

A recent time travelling splitter variant involves entire communities (and not just individuals like Twain's [[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court|Connecticut Yankee]]) being shifted uptime to be the founding fathers of new time branches. These communities are transported either from the present or the near-future to the past via a natural disaster, the action of technologically advanced aliens, or a human experiment gone wrong.

[[S.M. Stirling]] has written the ''[[Island in the Sea of Time]]'' trilogy, in which [[Nantucket]] Island and all its modern inhabitants are transported to [[Bronze Age]] times to become the world's first superpower. In [[Eric Flint]]'s [[1632 series]], a small town in [[West Virginia]] is transported to 17th century Europe and leads a revolution against the [[Hapsburgs]]. [[John Birmingham]]'s [[Axis of Time]] trilogy, deals with the culture shock when a United Nations naval task force from 2021 finds itself back in 1942 helping the Allies against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] and the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] (and doing almost as much harm as good in spite of its advanced weapons).

=== Cross-time stories ===

H.G. Wells' &quot;cross-time&quot;/&quot;many universes&quot; variant (see above) was fully developed by De Camp in his 1940 short story &quot;The Wheels of If&quot; (''[[Unknown Fantasy Fiction]]'', October 1940), in which the hero is repeatedly shifted from one alternate history to another, each more remote from our own than the last. This subgenre was used early on for purposes far removed from quasi-academic examination of alternative outcomes to historical events. [[Fredric Brown]] employed it to satirize the s-f pulps and their adolescent readers--and fears of foreign invasion--in the classic ''[[What Mad Universe]]'' (1949). In [[Clifford Simak]]'s ''[[Ring Around the Sun]]'' (1953), the hero ends up in an alternate earth of thick forests in which humanity never developed (the ultimate divergence) but where a band of mutants is establishing a colony; the story line appears to frame the author's anxieties regarding [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Cold War]].

=== Introducing the paratime patrol ===
Also in the late 1940s and the 1950s, however, writers such as [[H. Beam Piper]], [[Sam Merwin Jr.]] and [[Andre Norton]] wrote thrillers set in a [[multiverse]] in which all alternate histories are co-existent and travel between them occurs via a technology involving portals and/or paratime capsules. These authors established the convention of a secret paratime trading empire that exploits and/or protects worlds lacking the paratime technology via a network of James Bond style secret agents (Piper called them the &quot;paratime police&quot;).

This concept provided a convenient framing for packing a smorgasbord of historical alternatives (and even of timeline &quot;branches&quot;) into a single novel, either via the hero chasing or being chased by the villain(s) through multiple worlds or (less artfully) via discussions between the paratime cops and their superiors (or between paratime agents and new recruits) regarding the histories of such worlds.  Paratime thrillers published in recent decades often cite the [[Many-worlds interpretation|many-worlds interpretation]] of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]] (first formulated by [[Hugh Everett III]] in 1957) to account for the differing worlds. Prior to Everett, science-fiction writers drew on cruder fringe-science and Ouspenskian speculations to explain their characters' cross-time jauntings. 

The popular theme was further developed in the 1960s by [[Keith Laumer]] in the first two volumes of his ''Imperium'' trilogy, which would be completed in ''Zone Yellow'' (1990).  Piper's politically more sophisticated variant was adopted and adapted by [[Michael Kurland]] and [[Jack Chalker]] in the 1980s; Chalker's ''[[God, Inc.]]'' trilogy (1987-89), featuring paratime detectives Sam and Brandy Horowitz, marks the first attempt at merging the paratime thriller with the police procedural. Kurland's ''[[Perchance]]'' (1988), the first volume of the never completed &quot;Chronicles of Elsewhen&quot;, presents a multiverse of secretive empires that utilize a variety of means for cross-time travel, ranging from high-tech capsules to mutant powers. 

The concept of a cross-time version of a world war, involving rival paratime empires, was developed in [[Richard C. Meredith]]'s ''Timeliner'' trilogy in the 1970s, [[Michael McCollum]]'s ''A Greater Infinity'' (1982) and [[John Barnes (author)|John Barnes]]' ''Timeline Wars'' trilogy in the 1990s.

Given the limitless fictional possibilities of paratime travel themes, and the fact that both [[string theory]] and the many-worlds theory of quantum physics provide a highly plausible hard-science-fiction foundation for such stories, it is probable that this variant will continue to flourish in tandem with the more &quot;conventional&quot; alternate history stories described below.

=== Development of more sophisticated framings === 
Most of the early cross-time thrillers depicted the multiverse in Euclidean terms (pancake universes stretching to left and right of any given zero universe with the divergence point being earlier and earlier, and the differences greater and greater, the farther one moved in either direction from the zero point). McCollum and some later writers, however, have posited a pseudo-Einsteinian paratime in which universes are constantly shifting around, moving closer or farther from each other, with time dilating or contracting from one universe to another in unpredicable ways. This framing device expands the potential for using cross-time fiction to compare different outcomes uptime, downtime and crosstime all at once.

=== Major U.S. writers explore alternate histories ===

In [[1962]], [[Philip K. Dick]] published [[The Man in the High Castle]], an alternate history in which [[Nazi Germany]] and [[imperial Japan]] won [[World War II]]. This book, widely regarded as Dick's masterpiece, has enhanced the prestige of alternate history in mainstream literary circles, although Dick was not yet recognized beyond s-f circles when it was first published. Dick's book also contained an example of &quot;alternate-alternate&quot; history, in that one of its characters is the author of a book in which the Allies won the war.

It was followed by [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Ada]]'' (1969) (full title, ''Ada, or Ardor: A Family Chronicle''), a story of incest that takes place within an alternate North America settled in part by Czarist Russia, and that borrows from Dick's idea of &quot;alternate-alternate&quot; history (the world of Nabokov's hero is wracked by rumors of a &quot;counter-earth&quot; that apparently is ours). Some critics believe that the references to a counter-earth suggest that the world portrayed in &quot;Ada&quot; is a delusion in the mind of the hero (another favorite theme of Dick's novels). But even if the Ada-world is regarded as a delusion, it is still alternate history, since Nabokov describes it in detail and makes it come alive artistically. (Since all AH works are imaginative fiction, it really matters little if the AH is presented as the author's fiction alone or as the author's fiction mediated through a delusional character.)

''[[The Plot Against America]]'' ([[2004]]) by [[Philip Roth]] looks at an America where [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] is defeated in 1940 in his bid for a third term as President of the United States, and [[Charles Lindbergh]] is elected, leading to increasing [[fascism]] in the U.S.

=== Contemporary alternate history in popular literature, including the s-f genre ===   

The late 1980s and the 1990s saw a boom in popular-fiction versions of alternate history, fueled by the emergence of [[Harry Turtledove]], the [[steampunk]] genre and two series of anthologies&amp;mdash; the &quot;What Might Have Been&quot; series edited by [[Gregory Benford]] and the &quot;Alternate ...&quot; series edited by [[Mike Resnick]].  This period also saw alternate history works by [[S.M. Stirling]], [[Kim Stanley Robinson]], [[Harry Harrison]] and others.  

Since the late 1990s, Harry Turtledove has been the most prolific practitioner of alternate history. His books include a series in which [[Confederate States of America|the South]] won the [[American Civil War]] and another in which aliens invade Earth during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Other stories by this author include one with the premise that [[the Americas|America]] had not been colonized from [[Asia]] during the last [[ice age]]; as a result, the continent still has living [[mammoth]]s and a [[hominid]] species other than [[homo sapiens]]. Most recently (2005) he has begun a series in which the Japanese not only bomb [[Pearl Harbor]] but also invade and occupy the Hawaiian Islands. He has also launched an alternate history series for teenagers that utilizes a version of H. Beam Piper's paratime-trading-empire framing. 

Perhaps the most incessantly explored theme in popular alternate history focusses on worlds in which the Nazis won World War Two. In some versions, the Nazis conquer the entire world; in others, they conquer most of the world but a &quot;Fortress America&quot; exists under siege. ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'' (1992) by [[Robert Harris]], set in Europe following the [[Nazi]] victory, has been widely praised for portraying a more believable society and series of events than most other novels set in a Nazified world or Nazified Eurasia. Several writers have posited points of departure for such a world but then have injected time splitters from the future or paratime travel (for instance, [[James P. Hogan]]'s ''The Proteus Operation'' (1986) and [[Michael P. Kube-McDowell]]'s ''Alternities'' (1988)).

=== Alternate history in the contemporary fantasy genre ===

Many fantasies and science fantasies are set in a world that has a history somewhat similar to our own world, but with magic added. Since the existence of magic implies different laws of nature it is difficult to imagine a credible point of divergence:  The effects of divergence would have existed throughout human history and indeed throughout all evolution of life (unless one posits sudden changes in the laws of nature in medieval or modern times brought about by aliens, a time-space warp, etc.). One example of a universe that is in part historically recognizable but also obeys different physical laws is [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''Three Hearts and Three Lions'' in which the [[Matter of France]] is history, and the fairy folk are real and powerful. A partly familiar European history for which the author attempts to provide a logic-defying point of divergence is [[Randall Garrett]]'s &quot;Lord Darcy&quot; series. Whether a POD is hypothesized or not, it is probably best to regard such stories as depicting a kind of pseudo-alternity.  
 
[[Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell]] takes place in an alternate version of England where a separate Kingdom ruled by the Raven King and founded on magic existed for some time in Northumbria. In [[Patricia Wrede]]'s Regency fantasies, Great Britain has a Royal Society of Wizards, and in [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''A Midsummer's Tempest'' [[William Shakespeare]] is remembered as the Great Historian, with the novel itself taking place in the era of [[Cromwell]] and [[Charles I]]--and a premature [[Industrial Revolution]]. 

When the magical version of our world's history is set in contemporary times, one must clearly differentiate between alternate history on the one hand and secret history (as exemplified by [[Roswell]] saucers in an Air Force hanger or the [[Philadelphia Experiment]]) on the other. In works such as [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s &quot;Magic, Incorporated&quot; where a construction company can use magic to rig up stands at a sporting event and [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''Operation Chaos'' and its sequel ''Operation Luna'', where djinns are serious weapons of war -- with atomic bombs -- the use of magic throughout the United States and other modern countries makes it clear that this is not secret history or the result of a mere POD. Indeed, whenever the effects of the fantasical elements are so powerful and pervasive that they cannot plausibly be explained via secret machinations or a point of departure caused by human decisions, then the history depicted should be regarded as a pseudo-alternity. (This should apply not just to fantasy alternities but to satiric ones in which highly improbable events occur, as in ''What Mad Universe''.)

[[Philip Pullman]] mined both pseudo-alternate history and cross-time themes in ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' (1996-2000), a science-fantasy trilogy for young adults. Most notable is his variant version of Elizabethan England in the first volume, although given the different (magical) laws of nature there could be no credible point of departure, nor does Pullman attempt to provide one.

A fantasy version of the paratime police was developed by children's writer [[Diana Wynne Jones]] in her [[Chrestomanci]] quartet (1977-1988), with wizards taking the place of high tech secret agents. Among the novels in this series, ''[[Witch Week]]'' stands out for its vivid depiction of a history alternate to that of Chrestomanci's own world rather than our own (and yet with a specific POD that turned it away from the &quot;normal&quot; history of most worlds visited by the wizard).

Although [[J.K. Rowling]] does not deal explicitly with cross-time or alternate history themes in her [[Harry Potter]] books (outside of the &quot;time turner&quot; used in book three), her world of wizards who coexist quasi-invisibly with the [[Muggles]] can be seen as an eccentric variant in which two subuniverses/subhistories co-exist as subsets of a larger universe/history (or one can regard [[Hogwarts]] and other magical locales as merely being pocket universes within a primary Muggles universe). Of course, if Rowling were to spell this out it would spoil much of the charm of her fictional world.

== Elements of Alternate History ==

There are certain elements which are common to all alternate histories, whether they deal with history on the micro-level (personal alternate histories) or the macro-level (world-changing events).  These elements include:

*A point of change from the history of our world prior to the time at which the author is writing;
*A change which would alter history as it is known; and
*An examination of the ramifications of that change.

Alternate histories do not:

*Need to be set in the past;
*Need to spell out the point of divergence;
*Need to deal with world changing events; or
*Need to include famous people.

== The boundaries of alternate history ==

This leads to readers encountering stories which read ''as though'' they were alternate history, but which are not. An example would be [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Man Who Sold the Moon]]''. Written in the 1940s, it posits that the first moon launch is run by a private organization rather than a government agency in the 1960s.  New readers encountering the book may well presume that this is alternate history since it is clearly a counter-factual depiction of the first moon launch, now almost 40 years in the past.  However, ''when written'', the first moon launch was nearly 30 years in the ''future''.  Thus, ''The Man Who Sold the Moon'' is [[science fiction]], not alternate history.  The point of divergence happened after the time at which the author was writing.

Also one should not confuse the AH subgenre with [[secret history]], which gives an account of history at odds with our general understanding &amp;mdash; presenting its own account as having been concealed or suppressed by an elite. 

AH also should not be mistaken for mythical history--a history which supposedly has been forgotten through the passage of time, not through conspiratorial suppression. The works of [[Robert Howard]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] are excellent examples of fiction based on a lost-history framing, but they do not and cannot specify a point of departure from our own history, since there is no historical, archaeological or paleontological record on which such a POD could be based. Given the lack of any continuity with our world (and the lack of any kind of multiverse framing) such worlds are merely fantasy worlds and cannot be regarded as alternate history even in a borderline sense.

It is also possible to have novels that explore Points of Divergence (the key concept in alternate history) without actually being works of alternate history themselves. One good example is [[Marge Piercy]]'s critically acclaimed ''Woman on the Edge of Time'' (1976) in which a patient in a mental hospital is able to travel into two alternate futures--one an ecotopia run by reformed Weather Underground types and the other a fascist dystopia run by people-hating robots. Decisions she must make to resist an insidious new type of brain operation will determine which future wins. This is a time travel story, a cross-time story, a Christopher Priest style delusional alternate reality story and a POD story all rolled into one but it is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; alternate history because the POD occurs in the present (or perhaps the near future) not in the past.

Less obvious is the difference between alternate history and &quot;what if&quot; stories. The latter subgenre extrapolates, from the present, a concrete near-future possibility that is often an expression of current public fears (hence the alternate term &quot;cautionary tale&quot; used by Sackville-West, see below). For instance, beginning in the 1870s the British reading public was treated to a number of what-if books about a German or French invasion of an unready British Isles. During the [[Great Depression]], [[Sinclair Lewis]] wrote of a [[fascism | fascist]] takeover in the United State in his classic ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' ([[1935]]). During the early years of [[World War II]], [[Vita Sackville-West]] penned the science fantasy ''Grand Canyon'' ([[1942]]) in which the Germans invade a woefully unprepared United States. One could define such tales as borderline alternate history, since they are usually set in a time that is only shortly after the time of writing and the events described could not have occurred without a branching of history before, if only slightly before, the book was written.  

The boundary, like many in literature, is a broad line with grey edges (not unlike the fog around the alternate universe portals in science-fiction stories of fifty years ago). Would a 2005 author writing a story set in [[1970]] in Heinlein's universe, or [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Captain Nemo]]'' universe be writing SF or AH?  Opinions differ.

== Alternate history in other media ==

Several films have been made that exploit the concepts of alternate history, most notably [[Kevin Brownlow]]'s ''[[It Happened Here]]''.  Another such film is ''[[2009 Lost Memories]]'', a Korean film supposing that [[Hirobumi Ito]] was not assassinated by [[An Jung-geun]] in Harbin, China, in [[1909]]. 

A few movies about alternate pasts, however, focus on individuals rather than historical events and some students of AH would say these are '''not'''  alternate histories (e.g., [[Frank Capra]]&amp;#8217;s ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', and more recently the films ''[[Sliding Doors]]'' and ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]''). However, in the Capra film the angel shows [[Jimmy Stewart]] an alternate history in which he was never born--the changes in his home town are serious and far-reaching, creating a much darker reality for his neighbors. Thus if one posits, as Capra does, that changes in personal lives create a ripple effect in the larger history, then such stories do qualify as a type of alternate history (one could call them &quot;alternative local history&quot; or &quot;alternative interpersonal history&quot;). Such worlds with relatively small (and sometimes almost undiscernable) changes in personal lives were given the name &quot;cognate universes&quot; by [[Jack Vance]] in the novelette &quot;Rumfuddle&quot; (1973).   

The [[science fiction]] [[television show]] ''[[Sliders]]'' presented alternate histories under the science-inspired guise of quantum-navigating the [[multiverse]]. The alternate Americas in most episodes are nasty [[dystopias]], although sometimes this is not evident at first. Another such television show, a South Korean drama, [[Gung]] presents an point of divergence where the Korean monarchy is restored after the Independance from the Japanese Empire even up to the 21st Century.[http://www.imbc.com/broad/tv/drama/gung/index.html] (Note: This website is in Korean)

The dramatic possibilities of alternate history provide a diverse genre for exploration in [[role-playing game]]s. [[List of role-playing games#Period_Adventure.2FAlternate_History_Genres|Many games]] use an alternate historical background for their campaigns. In particular, [[GURPS]] uses a setting containing multiple different alternate histories as its default campaign setting.

==Points of divergence==

The key change between our history and the alternate history is known as the &quot;[[Point of divergence]]&quot; (POD).  In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', the POD is the attempted assassination of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[Miami]] in [[1933]].  In reality, this attempt failed.  Another alternate history with a point of divergence connected to Roosevelt is the backdrop to [[Philip Roth]]'s novel [[The Plot Against America]], in which Roosevelt is defeated in the [[1940]] [[United States presidential election, 1940|US presidential election]] by the isolationist [[Charles Lindbergh]], who reaches an accommodation with the [[Axis powers]] in [[World War II]] and keeps the [[United States]] out of the war. In Robert Harris's [[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]], the POD occurs when a German attack into the [[Caucasus]] succeeds in the Nazis seizing vital oil and cutting off supplies to the [[Red Army]]. This forces the USSR to surrender, enabling the Axis Powers to bring the remaining Allies to the peace table, one by one. Some variants of the theory of the [[multiverse]] posit that PODs occur every instant, springing off [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]s for each instance.  Even mainstream [[science fiction]] stories are known to have points of divergence - the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, for example, diverts from ours in that several key [[space disaster]]s never occurred, resulting in a much faster and smoother development of rocketry than in our timeline.

==Counterfactual and virtual history==
''See main articles: [[historical revisionism]], [[virtual history]]''

[[Historian]]s also speculate in this manner; this type of speculation is known commonly as &quot;counterfactual history&quot; or &quot;[[virtual history]]&quot;.  There is considerable debate within the community of historians about the validity and purpose of this type of speculation.

For alternate histories which some assert to be factual rather than speculative, see [[conspiracy theory]] and [[historical revisionism]].

==Sidewise Award for Alternate History==

In [[1995]], the [[Sidewise Award for Alternate History]] was established to recognize best Long Form (novels and series) and best short form (stories) within the genres.  The award is named for [[Murray Leinster]]'s story &quot;Sidewise in Time.&quot;

== Published alternate histories ==

Literally thousands of alternate history stories and novels have been published. Following is a somewhat random sampling:

* ''[[Weapons of Choice: Axis of Time series]]'' by [[John Birmingham]], which is part Alternate History, part Science Fiction. Its point of divergence is 1942 when an American-led UN Multinational Force arrives uptime from 2021 via a wormhole that was accidentally generated as a byproduct of a scientific experiment. Of course one could say there is also a downtime point of divergence--the point at which the UN force disappears from its &quot;normal&quot; time. (In other words, within the framing logic of parallel universe science fiction, the fictional experiment creates two new worlds or histories, while presumably leaving unchanged the future of a third world--the one in which the wormhole was never generated.)

* ''[[Lighter than a Feather]]'' (1971) by [[David Westheimer]], a story of the American invasion of Japan, [[Operation Olympic]], which was to have taken place in November 1945. The novel is seen from the point of view of both low-level Japanese military and civilian and American military members. 

* ''[[Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]], in which scientists from the future travel back to the 15th century to prevent the European colonisation of the Americas.

* ''[[Alvin Maker]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]], in which Card imagines North America where people wield magic, or knacks, and the revolution was only partly successful. 

* ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'' by [[Ward Moore]], in which the South was not defeated in the [[American Civil War]] because it won the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].

* ''[[The Man in the High Castle|The Man in the High Castle]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]] set in a world where the [[Axis powers]] won [[World War II]].

* ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'' by [[Robert Harris]] is also set in the 1960s in a Germany which won World War II.

*In &quot;The Forfeited Birthright of the Abortive Far Western Christian Civilization,&quot; [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] describes a world in which the Franks lost to the Muslims at the [[Battle of Tours]] in [[732]].

* ''[[SS-GB]]'' by [[Len Deighton]] is a detective novel set in 1941 Britain in which the Germans have successfully occupied the country.

* ''If Hitler Had Invaded England'', by [[C.S. Forester]], found in his collection of published short stories, ''Gold from Crete''.  The story is a fictionalized account of a German invasion of Britain in 1940, based on what Forester saw as realistic projections of German and British capabilities.  The German invasion fails short of reaching London due to continued British supremacy at sea and in the air. The resulting lack of river transport capability leads to an Allied victory. 

* ''Pavane'', by [[Keith Roberts]], assumes that Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] was assassinated, and in the ensuing disorder, the [[Spanish Armada]] was successful in suppressing [[Protestantism]]; the novel (actually a series of shorter pieces) is set in a 20th century where technology has advanced less than in our world, and where the [[Inquisition]] still has power.

* &quot;[[The Last Article]]&quot; is a [[short story]] by [[Harry Turtledove]], in which [[Mohandas Gandhi]] attempts to use [[non-violent resistance]] against India's [[Nazi]] occupiers.

* ''The Alteration'' by [[Kingsley Amis]] is set in a world very similar to that of ''Pavane''. In this world, [[Martin Luther]], rather than beginning the [[Protestant Reformation]], became [[pope]]. The novel concerns the attempt to prevent a young boy with a perfect singing voice from being recruited to the [[Holy See|Vatican's]] [[eunuch]] choir. There are a number of in-jokes, where famous works of [[fantasy and science fiction]] appear, under slightly different titles: 'The Wind in the Cloisters' and 'The Lord of the Chalices' for example.

* The &quot;[[Lord Darcy]]&quot; [[fantasy]] series by [[Randall Garrett]]; a number of short stories and one novel (''Too Many Magicians'') based on the premise that King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] of [[England]] returned safely from [[France]] and that [[Roger Bacon]] had systematised the laws of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. The stories are a series of traditional [[detective fiction]]-style [[murder mystery|murder mysteries]] with forensic magic being used in the investigation.

* The &quot;[[Western Lights]]&quot; [[science fantasy]] series by [[Jeffrey Barlough]] posits a cataclysmic event that has &quot;sundered&quot; [[Western Europe]] from the rest of the world.  The series features somewhat [[Steampunk]] [[Victorian era|Victorian]] technology and society juxtaposed with [[Ice Age]]-era creatures such as [[mastodon]] and [[saber-toothed tiger]]s.  Titles include ''Dark Sleeper'', ''The House in the High Wood'', and ''Strange Cargo''.

* ''[[GURPS Alternate Earths]]'' (ISBN 1-55634-318-3) and ''[[GURPS Alternate Earths II]]'' (ISBN 1-55634-399-X) a pair of &quot;What might have been&quot; supplements for the Third Edition of the [[GURPS]] role-playing game. Includes a world with a surviving Confederacy, a Nazi/Japanese Empire world, an Aztecs-rule-America scenario, a Viking empire and a unique &quot;[[Hugo Gernsback|Gernsback]]&quot; world in which the dreams of mad scientists and [[Doc Savage]] have become reality. The conflict between the [[Infinity Patrol (GURPS)|Infinity Patrol]] and [[Centrum (GURPS)|Centrum]] across the multiplicity of parallel Earths detailed in these supplements (and originating in ''[[GURPS Time Travel]]'') was made central to the Fourth Edition of GURPS as the default setting in the Basic Set and in the supplement ''[[GURPS Infinite Worlds]]''.

* ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' by [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]] is a [[steampunk]] novel which deals with a Victorian society in which [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[Analytical Engine]] takes on the roles of modern computers a century early.

*  ''[[Arrowdreams: An Anthology of Alternate Canadas]]'', edited by [[Mark Shainblum]] and [[John Dupuis]] features stories by [[Eric Choi]], [[Dave Duncan (writer)|Dave Duncan]], [[Glenn Grant]], [[Paula Johanson]], [[Nancy Kilpatrick]], [[Laurent McAllister]], the late [[Keith Scott]], [[Shane Simmons]], [[Michael Skeet]], [[Edo van Belkom]] and [[Allan Weiss]]. The collection garnered an [[Aurora Award]] in the &quot;Best Other Work in English&quot; category, while Edo van Belkom's short story &quot;Hockey's Night in Canada&quot; captured another for &quot;Best Short-Form Work in English.&quot;

* ''[http://www.incunabula.org/ebooks.html Ong's Hat]'' by [[Ong's Hat, New Jersey]] is an Internet legend that deals with a group of renegade scientists from Princeton that developed a means of travel to parallel universes and fled this Universe to found a colony in another world.

* ''[[How Few Remain]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] is set twenty years after a Southern victory in the [[American Civil War]] established the [[Confederate States of America]]. This novel is followed by the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]] trilogy, set in the 1910s, the [[American Empire (Harry Turtledove)|American Empire]] trilogy, taking the timeline up through the 1920s and 30s, and the [[Settling Accounts (Harry Turtledove)|Settling Accounts]] trilogy, detailing an alternate World War II.

* ''[[The Two Georges]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] and actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] is set in modern times under the assumption that [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] of Great Britain and [[George Washington]] reached a settlement where the 13 Colonies remained within the British Empire with increased autonomy and virtually all of their grievances redressed. The book follows two Royal American Mounted Police officers attempting to recover the famous painting of the meeting between the Two Georges by [[Thomas Gainsborough]] after it had been stolen by anti-British terrorists. The painting had become a national treasure and the principal symbol of the unification between Britain and America. 

* ''[[Making History]]'' (1996) by British actor, comedian and novelist [[Stephen Fry]] is set in a [[parallel world]] in which [[Adolf Hitler]] was never conceived, let alone born.

* ''[[For Want of a Nail]]'' (1973) by American business historian [[Robert N. Sobel]] - details a world in which the [[American Revolution]] failed.  The British colonies become the Confederation of North America (CNA), while the defeated rebels go into exile in Spanish Tejas, eventually founding the United States of Mexico (USM) - a bitter rival to the CNA.  The gigantic [[multinational corporation]] Kramer Associates, originally from Mexico but later based in [[Taiwan]], is the third world power, and the first power to detonate an [[atomic bomb]]. This book is of particular interest because it is written in the format of a standard popular history, complete with footnotes and discussions of differing historical interpretations, and for the fact that for many years, at least one major municipal library (the Denver Public Library) had this book filed in its history collection rather than as fiction.

* ''[[The Domination]]'' by [[S. M. Stirling]] - after the [[United States]] conquers [[Canada]] in the [[War of 1812]],  the Loyalists move to [[South Africa]], where they join with the [[Boers]] to set up a [[slavery]]-based empire called the Domination of the [[Draka]].  The story tells of the struggle between the Domination and the [[free world]].  As the Draka come to dominate the world, they create a superhuman race.

* ''Conquistador'' by S.M. Stirling - an interdimensional gateway is discovered in California, which gives access to an alternate Earth in which the empire of [[Alexander the Great]] flourished, and where Europeans never discovered America.

* ''[[Wild Cards]]'' edited by [[George R. R. Martin]] - A series of collaborations based on the premise that an [[alien race]] released a virus just after the WWII that gave some people [[superpower]]s and others terrible deformities.

* ''[http://www.baen.com/library/0671319728/0671319728.htm 1632]'' by [[Eric Flint]] - (found online at the [[Baen Free Library|Baen Books free library]] in various ebook formats.) Its sequels, starting with ''[http://www.webscription.net/10.1125/Baen/0743435427/0743435427.htm 1633]'' are available for sale.  A series based on the premise that an entire modern [[West Virginia]] town is transported in time and space to Germany during the [[Thirty Years War]].

*''Rivers of War'' by [[Eric Flint]] is an alternate history of the American frontier. It posits that [[Sam Houston]] was not injured at the beginning of the War of 1812, and substantially revises the history of the [[Trail of Tears]].

* ''1945'' by [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[William R. Forstchen]] assumes that the Germans perfected long-range [[jet aircraft]] by the end of [[World War II]] and conducted successful raids in North America against the US nuclear program.

* ''The Probability Broach'' by [[L. Neil Smith]] One single word in the [[Declaration of Independence]] differs and the US becomes the North American Confederation, a [[libertarian]] society. In the present some scientist will invent the Probability Broach and make contact with other universes.
**''The Venus Belt''
**''Their Majesties' Bucketeers''
**''The Nagasaki Vector''
**''Tom Paine Maru''
**''The Gallatin Divergence''

*''The Indians Won'' (ISBN 0843910127) by [[Martin Cruz Smith]] imagines that the [[Native Americans (U.S.)|Native Americans]] had won the [[Indian Wars|Indian wars]] and kept their land.

* ''The Coming of the Demons'' by [[Gwenyth Hood]] imagines if the execution of [[Conradin|Conradin Hohenstaufen]] in Naples on [[October 29]], [[1268]] was averted by the arrival of the Pelezitereans, exiled alien wanderers from another galaxy, seeking an uninhabited planet on which to reestablish their advanced culture.

* ''[[1901]]'' by [[Robert Conroy]] depicts a hypothetical war between Germany and the United States at the start of [[William McKinley]]'s second term as President.

*[[Mamoru Oshii]]'s [[manga]] ''Kerebos'', a.k.a ''Hellhounds Panzer Cops'' in the United States, and the [[film]] [[Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade]], both of which take place in a 1960's Japan that was defeated and occupied by the Germans.

* [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[The Years of Rice and Salt]]'' imagines a world in which [[the Black Death]] of the 14th century kills 99% of the people in Europe.  Over the next seven centuries, [[China]] and the [[Islamic world]] come to dominate the planet as they colonize a North America whose native peoples have all united in the Hodenosaunee League under the [[Iroquois]], clash in India (a place of many scientific innovations), and the Muslims resettle a depopulated Europe.

* [[Robert Silverberg]]'s ''[[Roma Eterna]]'' is set in a world where the [[Red Sea]] did not part before [[Moses]]. As a result, the [[Roman Empire]] grew and prospered without the influence of [[Christianity]]. The novel is a series of short stories set in the same alternate history, up to [[2000|2753]] [[ab urbe condita|AUC]].

* [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Strata (novel)|Strata]]'' is set in a world where [[Remus]] won the right to name the city and not [[Romulus]]. As a result, the [[Roman Empire]] is known as the ''Remen empire''. Other changes result from this.

* [[John M. Ford]]'s ''[[The Dragon Waiting]]'' is set in a Europe where the Emperor Julian lived long enough to re-establish paganism in the Roman Empire.

* ''[[The Shadow of the Lion]]'' and ''[[This Rough Magic]]'', a collaboration between [[Mercedes Lackey]], [[Eric Flint]] and [[Dave Freer]], is set in a renaissance Europe where the [[Library of Alexandria]] was not destroyed by a Christian mob and the now sainted [[Hypatia of Alexandria]] and [[John Chrysostom]] shaped religious thought, significantly altering how the Church developed. The novels center around the [[Republic of Venice]].

* The [[Belisarius series]] of novels by [[David Drake]] and [[Eric Flint]] take place when opposing factions from the future influence early times through intermediaries for their own purposes: the 'good' side operating through the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] general [[Belisarius]] and the 'evil' side operating through the Indian state of [[Malwa]].

* [[Michael Moorcock]]'s ''[[The Nomad of the Time-Streams]]'' trilogy (aka ''The Nomad of Time''), a series of novels featuring a grown-up version of [[E. Nesbit]]'s [[Oswald Bastable]] (from [[The Treasure Seekers]] and other books) who experiences a variety of alternate realities that have diverged from his own time-line.

== Online alternate histories ==

''[[soc.history.what-if]]'' is a [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] devoted to discussing alternate histories.  This newsgroup has spawned a number of interesting alternate timelines, including an online [[role playing game]] which has run continuously since [[2000]] called SHWI-ISOT with a [[POD]] in [[1800]] and in which the characters are based on the players being sent from the 21st century back to an alternate early 19th Century, where they have started altering history.  The concept was inspired by [[S.M. Stirling]]'s &quot;Island on the Sea of Time&quot; books.

In online alternate history, the timeline is usually referred to by the abbreviation ''ATL'' (Alternate Time Line), as contrasted with ''OTL'' (Our Time Line) which refers to real history.

*  ''[http://www.butteredcat.com/ 1933]'' an alternative view of the 20th century post-1933 in which [[Adolf Hitler]] succeeds in creating an alliance between Nazi Germany and the British Empire resulting in the invasion and conquests of France and the Soviet Union, and the resulting long and prolonged cold war between the Anglo-German alliance and the United States.

*  ''[http://www.alternatehistory.com/foralltime/ For All Time]'' (&quot;President Chester A. Arthur&quot; or Mike Davis) is a [[dystopia]]n post-WWII scenario resulting from the death of Roosevelt shortly after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], featuring horrific three-way [[race riot]]s in the [[United States]] between white, black and Jewish gangs, and frequent usage of [[nuclear weapon]]s around the world.

*  ''[http://www.shatteredworld.net Shattered World]'' (Bobby Hardenbrook) is a devastating alternate [[World War II]], resulting from a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion of [[Poland]] in [[1937]].  The timeline currently continues up to the autumn of [[1948]]. Some terminology is clearly inspired by [[The Domination]], as there is an &quot;Alliance for Democracy&quot; (which however does not include the United States) and a &quot;Eurasian War&quot;, which is an Axis-Soviet war which precedes the main World War II.

*  ''[http://www.geocities.com/wmlives/ALB1.html A Loose Bandage]'' (Beck Reilly) is an alternate 20th century following the failed assassination of [[William McKinley]].

*  ''[http://www.geocities.com/drammos/sealion1.html Sealion Fails]'' (Steven Rogers) is an alternate World War II in which Germany invades England, but the invasion is defeated.

*  ''[http://www.quarryhouse.free-online.co.uk/ed/ASHATW.htm A Shot Heard Around the World]'' (Ed Thomas) follows from the [[assassin]]ation of the [[Prince of Wales]] in [[1900]] (who in OTL became King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]), preventing the [[Entente Cordiale]].  Without Britain as an ally France and Russia are easily defeated by the [[Central Powers]].  After the war [[Charles de Gaulle]] seizes power in France, and plans a war of vengeance against the Germans.

* ''[http://www.angelfire.com/gundam/japanese_empire/ Dai Nippon Teikoku: An Alternate History]'' is a history of a Japan which loses its territories on the Asian mainland in a war with the [[Soviet Union]].  As a result, Japan never goes to war with the [[United States]], and thus retains [[Karafuto]] and [[Micronesia]]. 

*  ''[http://www.alternatehistory.com/decadesofdarkness/ Decades of Darkness]'' (&quot;Kaiser Wilhelm III&quot;) suggests the early death of President [[Thomas Jefferson]] leading to the secession of [[New England]], resulting in a [[United States|United States of America]] dominated by [[slavery|slave owners]]. 

*  ''[http://www.kebe.com/for-all-nails/ For All Nails]'' is an ongoing, collaborative online continuation of ''For Want of a Nail'', which ended in [[1971]], the year the book had been written.  The authors believed the world depicted at the end of ''For Want of a Nail'' was an unpleasant one &amp;#8212; hence the name inspired by Chet's ''For All Time''.

*  ''[http://www.clockworksky.net/puritan_world/ah_pw_top.html Puritan World]'' (Tony Jones).  A different [[English Civil War]] results in a much earlier and much nastier [[American Revolution]].  Britain never becomes a world power.  By 1996, the New Commonwealth, a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[Puritan]] [[theocracy]] controlling all of North America, Britain, Australia and most of Japan, has recently begun a [[world war]] against the combined European powers of the Octuple Alliance.

*  ''[[Ill Bethisad]]'' is an ongoing, collaborative project with currently ca. 45 participants, originally created by [http://hobbit.griffler.co.nz/ Andrew Smith] from [[New Zealand]].

* ''[http://shwi.alternatehistory.com/Mr%20Hughes%20Goes%20to%20War.txt Mr. Hughes Goes to War]'' An alternate history where [[Charles Evans Hughes]] is elected [[President of the United States]] in [[1916]]

* ''[http://www2.gilemon.com:8080/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page WikiDusk]'' is an Open Source novel - Wiki-editable - where on [[December 27]] [[2004]], a [[Starquake (star)|huge explosion halfway across the galaxy]] had packed even more power. [http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/050718_star_quake.html]

[[Eric Flint]]'s rare policy of supporting [[fanfiction]] based on his [[1632 (novel)|1632 novel]] universe has created a vibrant forum section at [[Baen's Bar]], discussing the consequences of an event in which the fictional modern American town is transported back in time into the middle of the [[Thirty Years' War]], in the German province of [[Thuringia]].

'''Audiogalaxy''' was a [[file sharing]] system located at http://www.audiogalaxy.com/ that indexed [[MP3]] files. Founded by [[Michael Merhej]] and sporting a web-based [[search engine]], always-on searching for requested files, auto-resume and low system impact, it quickly gained ground among file sharers abandoning [[Napster]] in [[2001]].  Some observing the previous downfall of Napster via lawsuit were shocked at the design of Audiogalaxy, which was in some ways more centralized than Napster.

*&quot;I don't get it- why do you guys still come here? lol&quot;- Famous quote by Michael Merhej who posted on the GD board!!!

* In May of 2001, Audiogalaxy implemented &quot;groups&quot; which allowed group members to send songs to everyone in the group. Clever hackers used this backdoor to circumvent the &quot;blocked songs&quot;  restriction, where Audiogalaxy could deny transfer of specific copyrighted songs.

* For those curious, here is how blocked songs could be downloaded, Not quite &quot;hacking&quot; but a clever workaround:
  &quot;You need 2 accounts, so sign up for a second if you only have one.
  create a group with your 1st a/c and get your 2nd a/c to join it,
  go into your 2nd a/c &amp; click the song with the X you want 2 download,
  it will tell you its copyrighted
  look at the url in the address bar &amp; take note of the numbers at the end,
  paste this into the address bar &amp; add the numbers (and go to that url):
  http://www.audiogalaxy.com/groups/sendSong.php?&amp;g=
  click send to group
  go back into your 1st a/c &amp; run the satellite
  the copyrighted song will start downloading!&quot;

* On [[May 9]], [[2002]], Audiogalaxy required songs to be in the sender's shared folder to be sent. Previously, one could send any song to anyone by editing the [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] parameters. This protection was quickly defeated by creating a &quot;dummy&quot; file in one's shared folder, and sending a song with the same name -- due to Audiogalaxy's [[checksum]] [[hash function|hashing]], the correct file was always sent despite the dummy.

* Even though Audiogalaxy claimed that they were trying to cooperate with the [[music industry]] and block [[copyright]]ed songs from their network, they continued to offer illegal MP3s and were sued by [[RIAA]], on [[May 24]], [[2002]]. On this day, Audiogalaxy blocked sending of all blocked songs.

* On [[June 17]], [[2002]], Audiogalaxy reached an [[out-of-court settlement]] with the RIAA. The settlement reached would allow Audiogalaxy to operate a &quot;filter-in&quot; system, which required that for any music available, the songwriter, music publisher, and/or recording company must first consent to the use and sharing of the work. 

* On [[September 8]], [[2002]], Audiogalaxy licensed and re-branded a for-pay streaming service called ''[[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]'' from [[Listen.com]] and discontinued its famous web-based P2P service.

* On [[December 25]], [[2002]], Martin Rieder wrote a preliminary form of a database-backed backwards-compatible Audiogalaxy server, dubbed OpenAG Server.



Audiogalaxy's stated mission was to facilitate sharing of music, though much more appears to have grown from its legacy. It was notable for its strong community due to such features as chat-enabled groups and per-artist [[internet forum]]s.  Although music is no longer shared, some message boards are still moderately active. Some of the more active forums include the Radiohead, Rush, and General Discussion boards.

'''Atomic orbitals''' are the [[quantum state]]s of the individual electrons in the [[electron cloud]] around a single atom. Classically, the atomic orbitals can be thought of as similar to the orbits of the planets around the Sun. However, it is important to note that the atomic orbitals cannot actually be described classically. In fact, explaining the behaviour of the electrons that orbit an atom was one of the driving forces behind quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, the atomic orbitals are the quantum states that electrons surrounding an atom may exist in. These can be described as a [[wave function]] over space, as shown in the diagram on the right, by the ''n'', ''l'', and ''m'' [[quantum numbers]] of the orbital, or by the names of the orbitals, as used in [[electron configuration]]s.

== Historical Background ==

See the article [[atomic orbital model]] for details on how the current model of atomic orbitals was developed. This article also gives a less technical description of the model.

== Formal Quantum Mechanical Definition ==

In [[quantum mechanics]], the state of an atom, i.e. the [[eigenstate]]s of the atomic [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], are expanded (see [[configuration interaction]] expansion and [[basis (linear algebra)]]) into [[linear combination]]s of anti-symmetrized products ([[Slater determinant]]s) of one-[[electron]] functions.  The spatial components of these one-electron functions are called '''atomic orbitals'''.  (When one considers also their [[spin (physics) | spin]] component, one speaks of '''atomic spin orbitals'''.) 

In [[atomic physics]], the [[atomic spectral line]]s correspond to transitions ([[quantum leap]]s) between [[quantum state]]s of an [[atom]].  These states are labelled by a set of [[quantum number]]s summarized in the [[term symbol]] and usually associated to particular [[electron configuration]]s, i.e. by occupations schemes of '''atomic orbitals''' (e.g. &lt;math&gt;1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 &lt;/math&gt; for the ground state of [[neon]] -- term symbol: &lt;math&gt;{}^1S_0&lt;/math&gt;).  This notation means that the corresponding [[Slater determinant]]s have a clear higher weight in the [[configuration interaction]] expansion.  The atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated to a given transition.  One can say for example for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital.  Nevertheless one has to keep in mind that electrons are [[fermion]]s ruled by [[Pauli exclusion principle]] and cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom. Moreover, it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinantal wave function at all.  This is the case when [[electron correlation]] is large. 

== Hydrogen-like atoms ==
{{main|Hydrogen-like atom}}

The simplest atomic orbitals are those that occur in an atom with a single electron, such as the [[hydrogen atom]].  In this case the atomic orbitals are the eigenstates of the hydrogen Hamiltonian.  They can be obtained analytically (see [[Hydrogen atom]]).  An atom of any other element [[ion]]ized down to a single electron is very similar to hydrogen, and the orbitals take the same form.

For atoms with two or more electrons, the governing equations can only be solved with the use of methods of iterative approximation.  Orbitals of multi-electron atoms are ''qualitatively'' similar to those of hydrogen, and in the simplest models, they are taken to have the same form.  For more rigorous and precise analysis, the numerical approximations must be used.

A given (hydrogen-like) atomic orbital is identified by unique values of three [[quantum number]]s:  [[Principal quantum number|''n'']], [[Azimuthal quantum number|''l'']], and [[magnetic quantum number|''m&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'']]. The rules restricting the values of the quantum numbers, and their energies (see below), explain the [[electron configuration]] of the atoms and the [[periodic table]].

The stationary states ([[quantum state]]s) of the hydrogen-like atoms are its atomic orbital.  However, in general, an electron's behavior is not fully described by a single orbital.  Electron states are best represented by time-depending &quot;mixtures&quot; ([[linear combination]]s) of multiple orbitals. See [[Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method]].

The quantum number ''n'' first appeared in the [[Bohr model]].  It determines, among other things, the distance of the electron from the nucleus; all electrons with the same value of ''n'' lay at the same distance.  Modern quantum mechanics confirms that these orbitals are closely related.  For this reason, orbitals with the same value of ''n'' are said to comprise an &quot;[[electron shell|shell]]&quot;.  Orbitals with the same value of ''n'' and also the same value of ''l'' are even more closely related, and are said to comprise a &quot;[[electron subshell|subshell]]&quot;.

== Qualitative characterization ==

=== Limitations on the quantum numbers ===

An atomic orbital is uniquely identified by the values of the three quantum numbers, and each set of the three quantum numbers corresponds to exactly one orbital, but the quantum numbers only occur in certain combinations of values.  The rules governing the possible values of the quantum numbers are as follows:

The [[principal quantum number]] ''n'' is always a [[positive integer]].  In fact, it can be any positive integer, but for reasons discussed below, large numbers are seldom encountered.  Each atom has, in general, many orbitals associated with each value of ''n''; these orbitals together are sometimes called a ''[[Electron shell|shell]]''.

The [[azimuthal quantum number]] &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is a non-negative integer.  Within a shell where ''n'' is some integer ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; ranges across all (integer) values satisfying the relation &lt;math&gt;0 \le \ell \le n_0-1&lt;/math&gt;.  For instance, the ''n'' = 1 shell has only orbitals with &lt;math&gt;\ell=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the ''n'' = 2 shell has only orbitals with &lt;math&gt;\ell=0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\ell=1&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of orbitals associated with a particular value of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes collectively called a ''subshell''.  

The [[magnetic quantum number]] &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt; is also always an integer.  Within a subshell where &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is some integer &lt;math&gt;\ell_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt; ranges thus: &lt;math&gt;-\ell_0 \le m_\ell \le \ell_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The above results may be summarized in the following table.  Each cell represents a subshell, and lists the values of &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt; available in that subshell.  Empty cells represent subshells that do not exist.

Subshells are usually identified by their &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;- and &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-values.  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is represented by its numerical value, but &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is represented by a letter as follows: 0 is represented by 's', 1 by 'p', 2 by 'd', 3 by 'f', and 4 by 'g'.  For instance, one may speak of the subshell with &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell=0&lt;/math&gt; as a '2s subshell'.

=== The shapes of orbitals ===

Any discussion of the shapes of electron orbitals is necessarily imprecise, because a given electron, regardless of which orbital it occupies, can at any moment be found at any distance from the nucleus and in any direction due to the [[Uncertainty Principle]].

However, the electron is much more likely to be found in certain regions of the atom than in others.  Given this, a ''boundary [[surface]]'' can be drawn so that the electron has a high probability to be found anywhere within the surface, and all regions outside the surface have low values.  The precise placement of the surface is arbitrary, but any reasonably compact determination must follow a pattern specified by the behavior of &lt;math&gt;\psi^2&lt;/math&gt;, the square of the wavefunction.  This boundary surface is what is meant when the &quot;shape&quot; of an orbital is mentioned.

Generally speaking, the number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; determines the size and energy of the orbital: as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; increases, the size of the orbital increases.

Also in general terms, &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; determines an orbital's shape, and &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt; its orientation.  However, since some orbitals are described by equations in [[complex number]]s, the shape sometimes depends on &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt; also. &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;-orbitals (&lt;math&gt;\ell=0&lt;/math&gt;) are shaped like spheres.  &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-orbitals have the form of two [[ellipsoid]]s with a [[point of tangency]] at the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (sometimes referred to as a dumbbell).  The three &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-orbitals in each shell are oriented at right angles to each other, as determined by their respective values of &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt;.

Four of the five &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-orbitals look similar, each with four pear-shaped balls, each ball tangent to two others, and the centers of all four lying in one plane, between a pair of axes.  Three of these planes are the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;-, &lt;math&gt;xz&lt;/math&gt;-, and &lt;math&gt;yz&lt;/math&gt;-planes, and the fourth has the centres on the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axes.  The fifth and final &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-orbital consists of three regions of high probability density: a [[torus]] with two pear-shaped regions placed symmetrically on its &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis.

== Orbital energy ==

In atoms with a single electron (essentially the [[hydrogen atom]]), the energy of an orbital (and, consequently, of any electrons in the orbital) is determined exclusively by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  The &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; orbital has the lowest possible energy in the atom.  Each successively higher value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; has a higher level of energy, but the difference decreases as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; increases.  For high &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the level of energy becomes so high that the electron can easily escape from the atom.

In atoms with multiple electrons, the energy of an electron depends not only on the intrinsic properties of its orbital, but also on its interactions with the other electrons.  These interactions depend on the detail of its spatial probability distribution, and so the [[energy level]]s of orbitals depend not only on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; but also on &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;.  Higher values of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are associated with higher values of energy; for instance, the 2''p'' state is higher than the 2''s'' state.  When &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; = 3, the increase in energy of the orbital becomes so large as to push the energy of orbital above the energy of the ''s''-orbital in the next higher shell; when &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; = 4 the energy is pushed into the shell two steps higher.

The energy order of the first 24 subshells is given in the following table.  Each cell represents a subshell with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; given by its row and column indices, respectively.  The number in the cell is the subshell's position in the sequence.  Empty cells represent subshells that either do not exist or stand farther down in the sequence.

== Electron placement and the periodic table ==

Several rules govern the placement of electrons in orbitals (''[[electron configuration]]'').  The first dictates that no two electrons in an atom may have the same set of values of quantum numbers (this is the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]).  These quantum numbers include the three that define orbitals , as well as (the hitherto unmentioned) [[Spin quantum number|''s'']].  Thus, two electrons may occupy a single orbital, so long as they have different values of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. However, ''only'' two electrons, because of their spin, can be associated with each orbital.

Additionally, an electron always tries to occupy the lowest possible energy state.  It is possible for it to occupy any orbital so long as it does not violate the Pauli exclusion principle, but if lower-energy orbitals are available, this condition is unstable.  The electron will eventually lose energy (by releasing a [[photon]]) and drop into the lower orbital.  Thus, electrons fill orbitals in the order specified by the energy sequence given above.

This behavior is responsible for the structure of the [[periodic table]].  The table may be divided into several rows (called 'periods'), numbered starting with 1 at the top.  The presently known elements occupy seven periods.  If a certain period has number &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, it consists of elements whose outermost electrons fall in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th shell.

The periodic table may also be divided into several numbered rectangular 'blocks'.  The elements belonging to a given block have this common feature: their highest-energy electrons all belong to the same &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-state (but the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; associated with that &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-state depends upon the period).  For instance, the leftmost two columns constitute the 's-block'.  The outermost electrons of Li and Be respectively belong to the 2s subshell, and those of Na and Mg to the 3s subshell.

The number of electrons in a neutral atom increases with the [[atomic number]]. The electrons in the outermost shell, or ''[[valence electron]]s'', tend to be responsible for an element's chemical behavior. Elements that contain the same number of valence electrons can be grouped together and display similar chemical properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[chemistry]], an '''amino acid''' is any [[molecule]] that contains both [[amino]] and [[carboxylic acid]] [[functional group|functional groups]]. In [[biochemistry]], this shorter and more general term is frequently used to refer to alpha amino acids: those amino acids in which the amino and carboxylate functionalities are attached to the same [[carbon]], the so-called [[alpha carbon|&amp;alpha;&amp;ndash;carbon]].

An '''amino acid residue''' is what is left of an amino acid once a molecule of [[water]] has been lost (an [[hydrogen ion|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] from the nitrogenous side and an [[hydroxyl ion|OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]] from the carboxylic side) in the formation of a [[peptide bond]].

==Overview==
Amino acids are the basic structural building units of [[protein]]s. They form short [[polymer]] chains called [[peptide]]s or [[polypeptides]] which in turn form structures called [[protein]]s. The process of such formation is known as [[translation (biology)|translation]], which is part of [[protein synthesis]].

[[Image:Phe-stick.png|thumb|[[Phenylalanine]] is one of the standard amino acids.]]

Twenty amino acids are encoded by the standard [[genetic code]] and are called [[proteinogenic]] or '''standard amino acids'''. 
At least two others are also coded by DNA in a non-standard manner as follows:

* [[Selenocysteine]] is incorporated into some proteins at a UGA [[codon]], which is normally a stop codon.
* [[Pyrrolysine]] is used by some [[methanogen]]s in [[enzyme]]s that they use to produce [[methane]].  It is coded for similarly to selenocysteine but with the codon UAG instead.

Other amino acids contained in proteins are usually formed by [[post-translational modification]], which is modification after translation in protein synthesis.  These modifications are often essential for the function of the protein. 

[[Proline]] is the only proteinogenic amino acid whose side group is cyclic and links to the a-amino group, forming a secondary amino group. Formerly, proline was misleadingly called an [[imino acid]]. 

Over one hundred amino acids have been found in nature.  Some of these have been detected in [[meteorite]]s, especially in a type known as [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s.  [[Microorganism]]s and [[plant]]s often produce very uncommon amino acids, which can be found in peptidic [[antibiotics]] (e.g., [[nisin]] or [[alamethicin]]).  [[Lanthionine]] is a sulfide-bridged alanine dimer which is found together with [[saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] amino acids in [[lantibiotics]] (antibiotic peptides of microbial origin). [[1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid|1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)]] is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid and a key intermediate in the production of the plant [[hormone]] [[ethylene]].

In addition to protein synthesis, amino acids have other biologically-important roles. [[Glycine]] and [[glutamate]] are [[neurotransmitter]]s as well as standard amino acids in proteins.  Many amino acids are used to synthesize other molecules, for example:
* [[tryptophan]] is a precursor of the neurotransmitter [[serotonin]]
* [[glycine]] is one of the reactants in the synthesis of [[porphyrins]] such as [[heme]].  

Numerous non-standard amino acids are also biologically-important: [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid]] is another neurotransmitter, [[carnitine]] is used in [[lipid]] transport within a [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[ornithine]], [[citrulline]], [[homocysteine]], [[hydroxyproline]], [[hydroxylysine]], and [[sarcosine]].

Some of the 20 standard amino acids are called [[essential amino acid]]s because they cannot be [[synthesize]]d by the [[human body|body]] from other [[chemical compound|compound]]s through [[chemical reaction]]s, but instead must be taken in with food.  In [[human]]s, the essential amino acids are [[lysine]], [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], [[methionine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], [[valine]]. [[Histidine]] and [[arginine]] are generally considered essential only in children, because of their inability to synthesise them given their undeveloped metabolisms.

The phrase &quot;branched-chain amino acids&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the aliphatic amino acids: leucine, isoleucine and valine.

==General structure==

The general structure of proteinogenic alpha amino acids is:

      &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
      |
  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-C-COOH
      |
      H
Where &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; represents a ''side chain'' specific to each amino acid.  Amino acids are usually classified by the [[chemical property|properties]] of the side chain into four groups. The side chain can make them behave like a [[weak acid|weak]] [[acid]], a [[weak base|weak]] [[basic (chemistry)|base]], a [[hydrophile]], if they are [[polar molecule|polar]], and [[hydrophobe]] if they are [[nonpolar]].

===Isomerism===
Except for [[glycine]], where &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = H, amino acids occur in two possible [[optical isomerism|optical isomers]], called D and L.  Using the newer [[Cahn Ingold Prelog priority rules]] for designating the configuration of optical isomers, the L isomer would assigned the letter S and the D isomer would be assigned the letter R.  The L (or S) amino acids represent the vast majority of amino acids found in [[protein]]s.  D (or R) amino acids are found in some proteins produced by exotic sea-dwelling organisms, such as [[cone snail]]s.  They are also abundant components of the [[cell wall]]s of [[bacterium|bacteria]].

The L- and D- conventions for amino acid do not refer to their own optical activity, but rather to the optical activity of glyceraldehyde as an analogue of the amino acids.  S-glyceraldehyde is levorotary, and R-glyceraldehyde is dexterorotary, and so S- amino acids are called &quot;L-&quot; even if they are not levorotary, and R- amino acids are likewise called &quot;D-&quot; even if they are not dexterorotary.

==Reactions==
Proteins are created by [[polymerization]] of amino acids by [[peptide bond]]s in a process called [[translation (biology)|translation]].  This [[condensation]] reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water.

===Chemical properties===
Following is a table listing the one letter symbols, the three-letter symbols, and the chemical properties of the side chains of the standard amino acids. The mass listed is the weighted average of all common isotopes, and includes the mass of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The one-letter symbol for an undetermined amino acid is ''X''. The three-letter symbol ''Asx'' or one-letter symbol ''B'' means the amino acid is either [[asparagine]] or [[aspartic acid]], whereas ''Glx'' or ''Z'' means either [[glutamic acid]] or [[glutamine]]. The three-letter symbol ''Sec'' or one-letter symbol ''U'' refers to [[selenocysteine]]. The letters ''J'' and ''O'' are not used.

| Very abundant, very versatile. More stiff than glycine, but small enough to pose only small steric limits for the protein conformation. It behaves fairly neutrally, can be located in both hydrophilic regions on the protein outside and the hydrophobic areas inside.

|  The sulfur atom binds readily to [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] ions. Under oxidizing conditions, two cysteines can join together by a [[disulfide bond]] to form the amino acid [[cystine]]. When cystines are part of a protein, [[insulin]] for example, this enforces [[tertiary structure]] and makes the protein more resistant to unfolding and [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]]; disulphide bridges are therefore common in proteins that have to function in harsh environments, digestive enzymes (e.g., [[pepsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]]), structural proteins (e.g., [[keratin]]), and proteins too small to hold their shape on their own (eg. [[insulin]]).

| Behaves similarly to glutamic acid. Carries a hydrophilic acidic group with strong negative charge. Usually is located on the outer surface of the protein, making it water-soluble. Binds to positively-charged molecules and ions, often used in enzymes to fix the metal ion. When located inside of the protein, aspartate and glutamate are usually paired with arginine and lysine.

|
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan contain large rigid [[aromaticity|aromatic]] group on the side chain. These are the biggest amino acids. Like isoleucine, leucine and valine, these are hydrophobic and tend to orient towards the interior of the folded protein molecule.

| Because of the two hydrogen atoms at the α carbon, glycine is not [[optical isomerism|optically active]]. It is the tiniest amino acid, rotates easily, adds flexibility to the protein chain. It is able to fit into the tightest spaces, e.g., the triple helix of [[collagen]]. As too much flexibility is usually not desired, as a structural component it is less common than alanine.

|In even slightly acidic conditions [[protonation]] of the nitrogen occurs, changing the properties of histidine and the polypeptide as a whole.  It is used by many proteins as a regulatory mechanism, changing the conformation and behavior of the polypeptide in acidic regions such as the late [[endosome]] or [[lysosome]], enforcing conformation change in enzymes. However only a few histidines are needed for this, so it is comparatively scarce.

|
| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Isoleucine, leucine and valine have large aliphatic hydrophobic side chains. Their molecules are rigid, and their mutual hydrophobic interactions are important for the correct folding of proteins, as these chains tend to be located inside of the protein molecule.

| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Behaves similarly to arginine. Contains a long flexible side-chain with a positively-charged end. The flexibility of the chain makes lysine and arginine suitable for binding to molecules with many negative charges on their surfaces. E.g., [[deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]]-binding proteins have their active regions rich with arginine and lysine. The strong charge makes these two amino acids prone to be located on the outer hydrophilic surfaces of the proteins; when they are found inside, they are usually paired with a corresponding negatively-charged amino acid, e.g., aspartate or glutamate.

| [[essential amino acid|Essential]] for humans. Always the first amino acid to be incorporated into a protein; sometimes removed after translation. Like cysteine, contains sulfur, but with a methyl group instead of hydrogen. This methyl group can be activated, and is used in many reactions where a new carbon atom is being added to another molecule.
