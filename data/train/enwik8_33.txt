      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ajanta ''' takes the name after the village Ajinţhā in [[Aurangabad]] district in the state of [[Maharashtra]] (N. lat. 20 deg.  32' by E. long. 75 deg.  48'). It is celebrated for its [[cave]] art and architecture. As of 1983, the Ajanta Caves have been an [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] specifically nominated for the international [[World heritage]] program.

==Introduction==

The caves are in a wooded and rugged horseshoe-shaped ravine about 3 1/2 m. from the village of Ajinthā. It is situated in the [[Aurangabad District, Maharashtra|Aurangābād]] district of [[Mahārāşţra]] State in India (106 kilometers away from the city of [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]]). The nearest towns are [[Jalgaon|Jalgāon]] (60 kilometers away) and [[Bhusawal|Bhusāwal]] (70 kilometers away). Along the bottom of the ravine runs the river Wāghūr or Waghōrā (from the root ''vyāghra'' in Sanskrit meaning the tiger), a mountain stream. There are 29 (officially numbered by the Archaeological Survey of India) caves, excavated in the south side of the precipitous scarp made by the cutting of the ravine, and vary from 35 to 110 ft. in elevation above the bed of the torrent.

The monastic complex of Ajantā consists of several [[vihara|vihāras]] (monastic halls of residence) and [[chaitya]]-grihas ([[stupa]] monument halls) cut into the mountain scarp in two phases. The first phase is called the [[Hinayana|Hinayāna]] phase (referring to the Lesser Vehicle tradition of Buddhism, when the Buddha was revered symbolically). At Ajantā, cave numbers 9, 10, 12, 13, and 15A (the last one was re-discovered in 1956, and is still not officially numbered) were excavated during this phase. These excavations have enshrined the Buddha in the form of the stupa, or mound. The second phase of excavation started on the site after a lull of over three centuries. This phase is popularly known as the [[Mahāyāna]] phase (referring to the Greater Vehicle tradition of Buddhism, which is less strict and encourages direct depiction of the Buddha through paintings and carvings). Some prefer to call this phase the [[Vakataka|Vākāţaka]] phase after the ruling dynasty of the house of the Vākāţakas of the Vatsagulma branch. The dating of the second phase has been debated among scholars. In recent years a consensus seems to be converging on fifth century dates for all the Mahāyāna phase caves. According to Walter M. Spink, a leading Ajantologist, all the Mahāyāna excavations were carried out from 462 to 480 CE. The caves created during the Mahāyāna phase are the ones numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. Cave 8 was long thought to be a Hinayāna cave, however current research shows that it is in fact a Mahāyāna cave. 

There were two chaitya-grihas excavated in the Hinayāna phase that are caves 9 and 10. Caves 12, 13, and 15A of this phase are vihāras. There were three chaitya-grihas excavated in the Vākāţaka or Mahāyāna phase that are caves 19, 26, and 29. The last cave was abandoned soon after its beginning. Caves 19 and 26 have a rather uncommon arrangement made to the central object of worship wherein the stupa is fronted by an image of the Buddha in standing and seated positions respectively. The rest of the excavations are vihāras: caves 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, and 28.

The vihāras are of various sizes the maximum being about 52 feet. They are often square-shaped. Their excavation exhibits a great variety, some with simple facade, others ornate; some have a porch and others do not. The hall was an essential element of a vihāras. In the Vākāţaka phase, early viharas were not intended to have shrines because they were purely meant to be halls of residence and congregation. Later, shrines were introduced in them in the back walls, which became a norm. The shrines were made to house the central object of reverence that is the image of the [[Buddha]] often seated in the ''dharmachakrapravartana mudra'' (the gesture of teaching). In the caves with latest features, we find subsidiary shrines added on the side walls, porch or the front-court. The facades of many vihāras are decorated with carvings, and walls and ceilings were often covered with paintings.

Changes in [[Buddhist]] thought in the first century BCE had made it possible for the Buddha to be deified and consequently the image of the Buddha as a focus of worship became popular marking the arrival of the Mahāyāna (the Greater Vehicle) sect.

In the past, scholars divided the caves in three groups, but this is now discredited in light of fresh evidence and research. This theory of dating believed that the oldest group of caves dated from [[second century BCE|200 BCE]] to [[third century|CE 200]], the second group belonged, approximately, to the [[sixth century|sixth]], and the third group to the [[seventh century]].

The expression ''Cave Temples'' used by [[Anglo-Indians]] for vihāras without the shrine is inaccurate. Ajanta was a kind of college monastery. [[Hsuan Tsang]] informs us that [[Dinnaga]], the celebrated Buddhist philosopher and controversialist, author of well-known books on logic, resided there. This, however, remains to be corroborated by further evidence. In their prime the vihāras were intended to afford accommodation for several hundreds, teachers and pupils combined.  It is tragic that none of the caves in the Vākāţaka phase were ever fully completed. This was because the ruling Vākāţaka dynasty suddenly fell out of power leaving the dominion in a likely crisis, which forced all activities to a sudden halt at the time of Ajanta's last years of activities. This idea first pronounced by Walter M. Spink is increasingly gaining acceptance based on the archaeological evidence visible on site.

Most of the subjects have been identified by the leading Ajantologist from Germany, Dieter Schlingloff.

==Cave 1==

It is first approached by the visitor on site, and has no relation to the chronological sequence of the caves. It is the first cave on the eastern end of the horse-shoe shaped scarp. According to Spink, it is one of the latest caves to have begun on site and brought to near-completion in the Vākāţaka phase. Although there is no epigraphic evidence, it has been proposed that the Vākāţaka king Harisena may have been the benefactor of this better-preserved cave. A dominant reason for this is that King Harisena was not involved initially in patronizing Ajanta, but could not have remained aloof for long, as the site was burgeoning with activity under his rule, and the Buddhist laity would have loved to see the Hindu king participating in the pious act of patronage. Besides, most of the themes depicted are royal.

This cave has one of the most elaborate carvings on the facade with relief sculptures on entablature and fridges. There are scenes carved from the life of the Buddha as well as a number of decorative motifs. There was once a two pillared portico visible in the 19th century photographs, which has since been perished. The cave has a front-court with cells fronted by pillared-vestibules on either side. These have high plinth level. The cave has a porch with simple cells on either end. The absence of pillared vestibules on ends suggest that the porch was not excavated in the latest phase of Ajanta when pillared vestibules had became a necessity and norm. Most areas of the porch was once covered with murals of which notably high degree of fragments remain. There are three doorways: a central doorway and two side-doorways. Between the main and the side-doorways, two square windows have been carved that lit the interiors.

Each wall of the hall inside is nearly 40 feet long and 20 feet high. Twelve pillars make a square colonnade inside supporting the ceiling, and creating spacious aisles along the walls. There is a shrine carved on the rear wall, which houses an impressive seated image of the Buddha, his hands being in the ''dharmachakrapravartana mudra.'' There are four cells each on the left, rear, and the right wall. The walls are covered with paintings suggesting a fair state of preservation from decay. The scenes depicted are mostly didactic, devotional, and ornamental. The themes are from the Jataka stories (the stories of the Buddha's former existences as Boddhisattva), life of the Gautam Buddha, and those of his veneration.

==Cave 2==

Cave 2 is next to Cave 1. It looks similar to cave 1 in many respects. Like cave 1, it is relatively in a better state of preservation. It is known specially for the paintings preserved on its walls, ceilings, and pillars.

Facade: The cave's facade has a porch visibly different from cave 1. Even the facade does not have carvings as in cave 1. What we see here is an eave supported by robust pillars that are ornamented with designs. The size and general ground plan, however, shares many things in common with cave 1.

Porch: As first suggested by Walter M. Spink, the porch has cells fronted by pillared vestibules (hereinafter CPV in this article) on either ends. This architectural element is not found in the porch of cave 1. That cave has simple cells on porch-ends. The reason is, as evidences indicate, similar porch-end cells once existed not only in cave 2 but most other caves began early in the Vakataka phase and transformed later as CPVs in later years. In fact, all the porch-ends in various caves as wells as on the facade's side-walls were originally blank without even a cell in the earliest, the inaugural plans that were based on the prototype of a typical Hinayana vihara. The need of the cells on the previously &quot;wasted areas&quot; arose as a solution to greater housing requirements in later years. It became a norm subsequently to add porch-end cells in the planning of later Vakataka excavations. Still later, these simple single cells on porch-ends were converted into CPVs or were being planned as such in order to create accommodate more room, symmetry, and beauty.

The paintings on the ceilings and walls of this porch are widely published. They depict the [[Jataka]] tales that are stories of the Buddha's life in former existences as [[Bodhisattva]]. The porch's rear wall has a doorway in the center, which allows entrance to the hall. On either side of the door is a square-shaped window carved to lit the interiors.

Hall: The hall has four colonnade making a square in the center of the hall. They support the ceiling. Each arm or colonnade of the square is parallel to each of the respective wall of the hall making an aisle in between. The colonnades have rock-beams above and below them. The capitals are carved and painted with various decorative motifs that include ornamental, human, animal, vegetative, and semi-divine forms. Monika Zin's research on the decorative and devotional themes of Ajanta paintings should be consulted by readers wanting to learn in detail.

Paintings: Paintings are everywhere except the floor or they were intended as such. At many places they have been damaged by the process of decay or human interference. Therefore, many areas of the painted walls, ceilings, and pillars are fragmentary. The painted narratives of  the Jataka tales are depicted only on the walls, which demanded special attention of the devotee. They are didactic in nature meant to inform the community about the Buddha's teachings and life through successive births. Their placement on the walls required the devotee to walk through the aisles and 'read' the narratives depicted in various episodes. (Alas, to prevent vandalism, the entry in the aisles is restricted by site-authorities). The narrative episodes are depicted one after another although not in a linear order. Their identification has been a core area of research on the subject since the time of the site's rediscovery in 1819 CE. Deiter Schlingloff's identifications have updated our knowledge on the subject.

For long the paintings were erroneously referred to as frescoes. However, we know now that it is best to call them murals because the typically known process and technique of 'fresco' painting is not found in these murals. At Ajanta, the technique used, the medium, materials, and process is unlike the examples found in the art history of other civilizations. In fact, these murals have a certain uniqueness about them that is rarely found elsewhere, even within the history of South Asian art. The process of painting involved several stages. First of all the rock surface was chiseled rough so that it can hold the plaster. The plaster was prepared of clay, hay, dung, lime, etc. Variations are found in ingredients and their proportions from cave to cave, and in various places in the same cave. While the plaster was still wet, the drawings were done, and the colors applied. The wet plaster has the capacity to soak the color so that the color becomes a part of the surface and would not peel off or decay easily. As regards the color, they were the so called 'earth color' or the 'vegetable color.' Various kinds of stones, minerals, and plants were used in combinations to prepare different colors. Sculptures were often covered with stucco to give them a fine finish and lustrous polish. The stucco had the ingredients of lime and powdered sea-shell or conch. The latter afforded peculiar shine and smoothness. In cave upper six, some of it is extant. The smoothness resembles the surface of a glass, which astonishes the visitor today.

The brush for painting was made of animal hairs and twigs of certain plants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ajmer''', or Ajmere, is a city in [[Ajmer District]] in [[India]]'s [[Rajasthan]] [[states and territories of India|state]].  Its population was approximately 500,000 in 2001. The city gives its name to a district, and also to a former province of [[British India]] called [[Ajmer-Merwara]], which, after India's independence, became the state of Ajmer until November 1, 1956, when it was merged into Rajasthan state.

It is situated in 26° 27, N. lat. and 74° 44, E. long., on the lower slopes of Taragarh hill, in the [[Aravalli Range]]. To the north of the city is a large artificial lake called the [[Anasagar]], whence the water supply of the place is derived. 

The city is well laid out with wide streets and handsome houses. Ajmer is at an important railway junction. The city is a trade center and has cotton mills and railroad shops. Manufactures include wool textiles, hosiery, shoes, soap, and pharmaceuticals.

The chief object of interest is the ''[[dargah]]'', or tomb of a famous [[Muslim]] [[sufi]] saint named [[Moinuddin Chishti]]. It is situated at the foot of the Taragarh hill, and consists of several white marble buildings arranged around two courtyards, including a massive gate donated by the [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]], a [[mosque]] donated by [[Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]], the Akbari [[Masjid]], and the domed tomb of the saint. To this place the emperor [[Akbar]], with his empress, performed a yearly pilgrimage on foot from [[Agra]] in accordance with the terms of a [[vow]] he had made when praying for a son. The large pillars erected at intervals of two miles the whole way, to mark the daily halting-place of the imperial pilgrim, are still extant.

The '''Adhai-din-ka-jhonpra''', a [[Jain]] temple constructed in [[1153]] and converted into a mosque by [[Mohammed of Ghori]] after [[1193]], is situated on the lower slope of the Taragarh hill. With the exception of that part used as a mosque, nearly the whole of the ancient temple has fallen into ruins, but the relics are not excelled in beauty of architecture and sculpture by any remains of Hindu art. Forty columns support the roof, but no two are alike, and great fertility of invention is manifested in the execution of the ornaments.

The city's Museum was once the residence of Emperor [[Akbar]], and presently houses a collection of the Mughal and Rajput armour and sculpture.

The summit of Taragarh hill, overhanging Ajmer, is crowned by a fort, the lofty thick battlements of which run along its brow and enclose the table-land. The walls are two miles in circumference, and the fort can only be approached by steep and very roughly paved planes, commanded by the fort and the outworks, and by the hill to the west. On coming into the hands of the [[British Raj]], the fort was dismantled by order of Lord [[William Bentinck]], and was converted into a sanatorium for the troops stationed at the British cantonment town of [[Nasirabad, India|Nasirabad]].

Ajmer is also home to [[Mayo college]], a boarding school founded by the British Raj in 1870 to educate the children of Rajputana's nobles on the lines of an English public school.

Ajmer was founded in the tenth century by Raja Ajay Pal [[Chauhan]], who established the dynasty which continued to rule the country (with many vicissitudes of fortune) while the repeated waves of [[Muslim]] invasion swept over [[India]], until it was conquered by Mohammed of Ghori, founder of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], in [[1193]]. Its internal government, however, was handed over to the Chauhan rulers upon the payment of a heavy tribute to the conquerors. It then remained feudatory to Delhi until [[1365]], when it was captured by the ruler of [[Mewar]]. In [[1509]] the place became a source of contention between the chiefs of Mewar and [[Marwar]], and was ultimately conquered in [[1532]] by the latter prince, who in his turn in [[1559]] had to give way before the emperor Akbar.  It continued in the hands of the Mughals, with occasional revolts, till [[1770]], when it was ceded to the [[Maratha]]s, from which time up to [[1818]] the unhappy district was the scene of a continual struggle, being seized at different times by the Mewar and Marwar rajas, from whom it was as often retaken by the Marathas. In [[1818]] the latter ceded it to the [[United Kingdom|British]] in return for a payment of 50,000 rupees. Since then the country has enjoyed unbroken peace and a stable government.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ajmer-Merwara''' (also Ajmere-Merwara) is a former province of [[British India]]. The province consisted of the [[district]]s of [[Ajmer]] and [[Merwara]], which were physically separated by the territory of [[Rajputana]] Agency. Ajmer-Merwara was administered directly by the British Raj, by a commissioner who was subordinate to the [[governor-general]]'s agent for Rajputana. Rajputana was made up of [[princely states]], ruled by local nobles who acknowledged British sovereignty. Ajmer-Merwara remained a province of India from independence in 1947 to 1950, when it became the state of [[Ajmer]]. Ajmer state was merged into Rajputana on [[November 1]], [[1956]].

The area of the province was 2710 square miles. The plateau, on whose centre stands the town of Ajmer, may be considered as the highest point in the plains of [[North India]]; from the circle of hills which hem it in, the country slopes away on every side - towards river valleys on the east, south, west and towards the [[Thar Desert]] region on the north.

The [[Aravalli Range]] is the distinguishing feature of the district. The range of hills which runs between Ajmer and [[Nasirabad]] marks the watershed of the continent of [[India]]. The rain which falls on the southeastern slopes drains into the [[Chambal River|Chambal]], and so into the [[Bay of Bengal]]; that which falls on the northwest side into the [[Luni River]], which discharges itself into the [[Rann of Kutch]].

The province is on the border of what may be called the [[arid zone]]; it is the debatable land between the north-eastern and south-western [[monsoon]]s, and beyond the influence of either. The south-west monsoon sweeps up the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] valley from [[Bombay]] and crossing the tableland at [[Neemuch]] gives copious supplies to [[Malwa]], [[Jhalawar]] and [[Kota]] and the countries which lie in the course of the Chambal River.

The clouds which strike [[Kathiawar]] and [[Kutch]] are deprived of a great deal of their moisture by the hills in those countries, and the greater part of the remainder is deposited on [[Mount Abu]] and the higher slopes of the Aravalli Range, leaving but little for Merwara, where the hills are lower, and still less for Ajmer. It is only when the monsoon is in considerable force that Merwara gets a plentiful supply from it. The north-eastern monsoon sweeps up the valley of the [[Ganges]] from the Bay of Bengal and waters the northern part of Rajasthan, but hardly penetrates farther west than the longitude of Ajmer.

On the varying strength of these two monsoons the rainfall of the district depends. The agriculturist of Ajmer-Merwara could never rely upon two good harvests in succession.

Before Indian independence, the [[Rajput]]s were land-holders, and the [[Jat]]s and [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]] were cultivators or the tenants.The Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of Jagirs Act, 1952 was the landmarks in the legal history of land reforms in Rajasthan which was followed by Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 that became applicable to the whole of Rajasthan. The overriding effect of this Act provided relief to the existing tenants and the rights accrued to tenants accordingly. Now the Jats are major land holders in the region. The [[Jainism|Jain]]s are traders and money-lenders. The aboriginal tribe of [[Mer]]s are divided between Hindus and followers of [[Islam]]. Trading centers include [[Beawar]] and [[Kekri]].

'''Abatement of debts and legacies''' is a [[common law]] doctrine of [[will (law)|wills]] that holds that when the equitable [[assets]] of a deceased person are not sufficient to satisfy fully all the creditors, their debts must abate proportionately, and they must accept a [[dividend]].

In the case of legacies when the funds or assets out of which they are payable are not sufficient to pay them in full, the legacies abate in proportion, unless there is a priority given specially to any particular legacy. Annuities are also subject to the same rule as general legacies. 

The order of abatement usually goes as follows:
#[[Intestate property]] (proprty not disposed of in the will itself) will abate first
#The [[residuary estate]] will abate next
#General devises (gifts of cash) will abate next
#Demonstrative devises (gifts of stock, or orders to sell property and give the proceeds to the beneficiary) will abate next
#Specific divises (gifts of tangible property) will abate last

[[Image:Smooches (baby and child kiss).jpg|thumb|A kiss can express affection.]]
'''Affection''' (from latin ''ad'', and ''facere'', meaning &quot;to do something to&quot;) is an [[emotion]] that derives from the recognition of one's own values in the character of another.

== Popular usage ==
It is popularly used to denote a feeling or type of [[personal relationship]] amounting to more than goodwill or [[friendship]]. By ethical writers the word has been used generally of distinct states of feeling, both lasting and spasmodic; some contrast it with ''[[passion (emotion)|passion]]'' as being free from the distinctively sensual element.  More specifically the word has been restricted to [[emotion]]al states which are in relation to persons.  In the former sense, it is the Greek pathos, and as such it appears in the writings of French philosopher René Descartes, Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza and most of the writings of early British ethicists.  On various grounds, however---e.g. that it does not involve anxiety or excitement, that it is comparatively inert and compatible with the entire absence of the sensuous element--At is generally and usefully distinguished from passion.  In this narrower sense the word has played a great part in ethical systems, which have spoken of the social or parental ''affections'' as in some sense a part of moral obligation.  For a consideration of these and similar problems, which depend ultimately on the degree in which the affections are regarded as voluntary, see [[H]]. Sidgwick, ''Methods of [[Ethics]],'' pp. 345-349.

== Psychology ==
In psychology the terms ''affection'' and ''affective'' are of great importance.  As all intellectual phenomena have by experimentalists been reduced to sensation, so all emotion has been and is regarded as reducible to simple mental affection, the element of which all emotional manifestations are ultimately composed.  The nature of this element is a problem which has been provisionally, but not conclusively, solved by many psychologists; the method is necessarily experimental, and all experiments on feeling are peculiarly difficult.  The solutions proposed are two.  In the first, all affection phenomena are primarily divisible into those which are pleasurable and those which are the reverse.  The main objections to this are that it does not explain the infinite variety of phenomena, and that it disregards the distinction which most philosophers admit between higher and lower pleasures.  The second solution is that every sensation has its specific affective quality, though by reason of the poverty of language many of these have no name.  W. Wundt, ''Outlines of [[Psychology]]'' (trans.  C. H. Judd, [[Leipzig]], [[1897]]), maintains that we may group under three main affective directions, each with its negative, all the infinite varieties in question; these are (a) [[pleasure]], or rather pleasantness, and the reverse, (b) tension and relaxation, (c) excitement and depression.  These two views are antithetic and no solution has been discovered. 

Two obvious methods of experiment have been tried:

# The first, introduced by A. Mosso, the [[Italy|Italian]] psychologist, consists in recording the physical phenomena which are observed to accompany modifications of the affective consciousness.  Thus it is found that the action of the [[heart]] is accelerated by pleasant, and retarded by unpleasant, stimuli; again, changes of weight and volume are found to accompany modifications of affection--and so on.  Apart altogether from the facts that this investigation is still in its infancy and that the conditions of experiment are insufficiently understood, its ultimate success is rendered highly problematical by the essential fact that real scientific results can be achieved only by data recorded in connection with a perfectly normal subject; a conscious or interested subject introduces variable factors which are probably incalculable. 

# The second is [[Fechner]]'s method; it consists of recording the changes in feeling-tone produced in a subject by bringing him in contact with a series of conditions, objects or stimuli graduated according to a scientific plan and presented singly in pairs or in groups.  The result is a comparative table of likes and dislikes. 

Mention should also be made of a third method which has hardly yet been tried, namely, that of endeavouring to isolate one of the three ''directions'' by the method of suggestion or even hypnotic trance observations.

      <comment>disambiguation from [[Bastard]] to [[Bastard (Law of England and Wales)]] - ([[WP:DPL|You can help!]])</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[law]], '''affiliation ''' (from [[Latin]] ''ad-filiare'', to adopt as a son) is the procedure by which the [[paternity]] of an [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] child is determined, and the obligation of contributing to its support enforced. More modernly, it has also become a term to describe a partnership between two or more parties.

== Affiliation procedures in England ==

In [[England]] a number of [[statute]]s on the subject have been passed, the chief being the Bastardy [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of [[1845]], and the Bastardy Laws Amendment Acts of [[1872]] and [[1873]].
The mother of a [[Bastard (Law of England and Wales)|bastard]] may summon the putative father to petty sessions within twelve months of the [[Childbirth|birth]] (or at any later time if he is proved to have contributed to the child's support within twelve months after the birth), and the justices, after hearing evidence on both sides, may, if the mother's evidence be corroborated in some material particular, adjudge the man to be the [[putative father]] of the child, and order him to pay a sum not exceeding five shillings a week for its maintenance, together with a sum for expenses incidental to the birth, or the [[funeral]] expenses, if it has died before the date of order, and the costs of the proceedings.

An order ceases to be valid after the child reaches the age of thirteen, but the justices may in the order direct the payments to be continued until the child is sixteen years of age.

An appeal to quarter sessions is open to the defendant, and a further appeal on questions of law to the [[King's Bench]] by rule ''[[nisi or certiorari]]''. Should the child afterwards become chargeable to the [[parish]], the sum due by the father may be received by the parish officer.

When a bastard child, whose mother has not obtained an order, becomes chargeable to the parish, the guardians may proceed against the putative father for a contribution.

Any woman who is single, a widow, or a married woman living apart from her husband, may make an application for a summons, and it is immaterial where the child is begotten, provided it is born in [[England]].

An application for a summons may be made before the birth of the child, but in this case the statement of the mother must be in the form of a sworn deposition.  The defendant must be over fourteen years of age.  No agreement on the part of the woman to take a sum down in discharge of the liability of the father is a bar to the making of an affiliation order.  In the case of twins it is usual to make separate applications and obtain separate summonses.

The Summary [[Jurisdiction]] Act ([[1879]]) makes due provision for the enforcement of an order of affiliation. In the case of [[soldier]]s an affiliation order cannot be enforced in the usual way, but by the [[Army]] Act ([[1881]]), if an order has been made against a soldier of the regular forces, and a copy of such order be sent to the secretary of state, he may order a portion of the soldier's pay to be retained. There is no such special legislation with regard to [[sailor]]s in the [[Royal Navy]].

== Affiliation procedures in other countries ==

In the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonies, and in the states of the [[United States]] (with the exception of [[California]], [[Idaho]], [[Missouri]], [[Oregon]], [[Texas]] and [[Utah]]), there is some procedure (usually termed filiation) akin to that described above, by means of which a mother can obtain a contribution to the support of her illegitimate child from the putative father.

The amount ordered to be paid may subsequently be increased or diminished ([[1905]]; 94 N.Y. Supplt. 372).  On the continent of [[Europe]], however, the [[legislation]] of the various countries differs rather widely.  [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[Servia]] and the [[cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Geneva]] provide no means of inquiry into the paternity of an illegitimate child, and consequently all support of the child falls upon the mother; on the other hand, [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and the majority of the Swiss cantons provide for an inquiry into the paternity of illegitimate children, and the law casts a certain amount of responsibility upon the father. 

Affiliation, in [[France]], is a term applied to a species of adoption by which the person adopted succeeds equally with other heirs to the acquired, but not to the inherited, property of the deceased.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For other senses of this word, see [[affirmation (disambiguation)]].''

An '''affirmation''' (from [[Latin]] ''affirmare'', to assert) is the declaration that something is true.

In [[logic]], an '''affirmation''' is a positive judgment, the union of the subject and predicate of a proposition.

In [[law]], an '''affirmation''' is a solemn promise or assertion made under the penalties of [[perjury]] that has exactly the same legal effect as an [[oath]].  To [[affirm]] is to make an affirmation.  This option is allowed to those who conscientiously object to taking an oath, usually to avoid the religious implications of an oath.  The [[Constitution of the United States]] makes four references to an &quot;oath or affirmation&quot;: In Article I, [[United States Senate|Senators]] must take a special oath or affirmation for the purpose of sitting as the tribunal for [[impeachment]]; in Article II, the president is required to take a specified  oath or affirmation before entering office (see [[oath of office]]); in Article VI, all state and federal officials must take an oath or affirmation to support the U.S. Constitution; and in Amendment IV, all [[arrest warrant]]s and [[search warrant]]s must be supported by [[evidence (law)|evidence]] given under oath or affirmation.  

In [[spirituality]] and [[personal development]], an '''affirmation''' is a form of [[autosuggestion]] in which a statement of a desirable intention or condition of the world or the mind is deliberately meditated on or repeated in order to implant it in the mind. Affirmation could be viewed positively as a mobilization of one's inner resources, or negatively as a kind of self-induced brainwashing, depending on the psychological depth and wisdom of the affirmation. For example, &quot;I am making more room in my life for success every day&quot; is a much wiser affirmation than &quot;I will win the lottery today!&quot;  Affirmations can be a very powerful means of reprogramming the [[unconscious mind]].  They appear to be most effective when repeated in a quiet and restful state of mind and body.

Perhaps the most often used and well-known affirmation is the word &quot;[[Amen]],&quot; which can be translated simply, &quot;so be it,&quot; affirming the truth of whatever was written or said immediately prior. While often used to conclude [[prayer]], the word itself is neutral as to its context and exemplifies a logical affirmation more than a spiritual one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[law]], the '''affray''' is the fighting of two or more persons in a public place to the terror (in [[French language|French]]: ''à l'effroi'') of the [[liege]]s.

The offence is a [[misdemeanour]] at [[United Kingdom|English]] [[common law]], punishable by [[fine]] and [[imprisonment]].

A fight in private is an [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]], not an affray.

As those engaged in an affray render themselves also liable to prosecution for [[assault]], [[Riot act|Unlawful Assembly]], or [[Riot]], it is for one of these offences that they are usually charged.

Any private person may, and [[constable]]s and justices must, interfere to put a stop to an affray.

In the [[United States]] the English common law as to affray applies, subject to certain modifications by the [[statute]]s of particular states (Bishop, ''Amer. Crim. Law,'' 8th ed., 1892, vol. i. sec.  535).

The [[India|Indian]] Penal [[Code]] (sect. 159) adopts the English definition of affray, with the substitution of ''actual disturbance of the [[peace]]'' for ''causing terror to the lieges.''

The [[Queensland]] Criminal [[Code]] of [[1899]] (sect. 72) defines affray as taking part in a fight in a public [[highway]] or taking part in a fight of such a nature as to alarm the public in any other place to which the public have access.  This definition is taken from that in the English [[Criminal Code]] Bill of [[1880]], cl. 96. 

Under the Roman [[Netherlands|Dutch]] law in force in [[South Africa]] affray falls within the definition of ''vis publica''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Affreightment ''' (from [[freight]]) is a [[legal term]] used in [[shipping]]. Contract of Affreightment is the expression usually employed to describe the contract between a shipowner and some other person called the freighter, by which the shipowner agrees to carry goods of the freighter in his ship, or to give to the freighter the use of the whole or part of the cargo-carrying space of the ship for the carriage of his goods on a specified voyage or voyages or for a specified time; the freighter on his part agreeing to pay a specified price, called ''freight,'' for the carriage of the goods or the use of the ship.  A ship may be let like a house to some person who takes possession and control of it for a specified term.  The person who hires a ship in this way occupies during the currency of his term the position of shipowner.  The contract by which a ship is so let may be called a charter-party; but it is not, properly speaking, a contract of affreightment, and is mentioned here only because it is necessary to remember the distinction between a charter-party of this kind, which is sometimes called a demise of the ship, and a charter-party which is a form of contract of affreightment, as will hereinafter appear. 

=== Rules of law. ===

The law with regard to the contract of affreightment is, of course, a branch of the general law of contract.  The rights and obligations of the shipowner and the freighter depend, as in the case of all parties to contracts, upon the terms of the agreement entered into between them.  The law, however, interferes to some extent in regulating the effect to be given to contracts.  Certain contracts are forbidden by the law, and being illegal are, therefore, incapable of enforcement.  The most important example of illegality in the case of contracts of affreightment is when the contract involves trading with an enemy.  The law interferes again with regard to the interpretation of the contract.  The meaning to be given to the words of the contract, or, in other words, its construction, when a dispute arises about it, must be determined by the judge or court.  The result is, that certain more or less common clauses in contracts of affreightment have come before the courts for construction, and the decisions in these cases are treated practically, though not perhaps quite logically, as rules of law determining the sense to be put upon certain forms of expression in common use in shipping contracts.  A third way in which the law interferes is by laying down certain rules by which the rights of the parties are to be regulated in the absence of any express stipulation with regard to the matter dealt with by such rules.  This is done either by statutory enactment, as by that part (Part VIII) of the Merchant Shipping Act [[1804]] which deals with the liability of shipowners; or by established rules of the unwritten law, the ''common law'' as it is called, as, for instance, the rule that the common carrier is absolutely responsible for the safe delivery of the goods carried, unless it is prevented by the act of God or the king's enemies.  These rules of law, whether common law or statute law, regulating the obligations of carriers of goods by sea, are of most importance in cases which are uncommon though not unknown at the present day, in which there is an affreightment without any written agreement of any kind.  It will, therefore, be convenient to consider first cases of this kind where there is no express agreement, oral or written, except as to the freight and destination of the goods, and where, consequently, the rights and obligations of the parties as to all other terms of carriage depend wholly upon the rules of law, remembering always that these same rules apply when there is a written contract, except in so far as they are qualified or negatived by the terms of such contract. 

=== In defaults of express contract. ===

The rules of the common or ancient customary law of [[England]] with regard to the carriage of goods were no doubt first considered by the courts and established with regard to the carriage of goods by common carriers on land.  These rules were applied to common carriers by water, and it may now be taken to be the general rule that shipowners who carry goods by sea are by the [[United Kingdom|English]] law subject to the liabilities of common carriers. (See, as to the grounds and precise extent of this doctrine, the judgments in Liver Alkali Company v. Johnson ([[1874]]), L.R., 9 Ex. 338, and Nugent v. Smith ([[1876]]) 1 C.P.D. 423.) In practice goods are not often shipped without a written contract or acknowledgment of the terms upon which they are to be carried.  For each separate consignment or parcel of goods shipped a bill of lading is almost invariably given, and when a whole cargo is agreed to be carried the terms are set out in a document called a charter-party, signed by or on behalf of the shipowner on the one part, and the shipper, who is called the charterer, on the other part.  But at present we are considering the relations of shipowner and shipper independently of any express contract, as in a case when goods are shipped and received to be carried to the place to which the ship is bound for a certain freight, but without any further agreement as to the terms of carriage.  In such a case the rights of the parties depend on the rules of law, or, which is much the same thing, upon the warranties or promises which though not expressed must, as the courts have held, be implied as arising from the relation between the parties as shipper and carrier.  The obligations on the one side and the other may be defined shortly to be as follows:--The shipper must not ship goods of a nature or in a condition which he knows, or ought, if he used reasonable care, to know to be dangerous to the ship, or to other goods, unless the shipowner has notice of or has sufficient opportunity to observe their dangerous character.  The shipper must be prepared, without notice from the shipowner, to take delivery of his goods with reasonable despatch on the arrival of the ship at the place of destination, being ready there to discharge in some usual discharging place.  The shipper must pay the agreed freight, and will not be entitled to claim delivery until the freight has been paid.  In other words, the shipowner has a lien on the goods carried for the freight payable in respect of the carriage.  On the other hand, the obligation upon the shipowner is first and foremost to deliver safely at their destination the goods shipped, and this obligation is, by the common law, subject to this exception only that the shipowner is not liable for loss or damage caused by the act of God or the king's enemies; but by statute (Merchant Shipping Act 1894, Part Viii.) it is further qualified to this extent that the shipowner is not liable for loss, happening without his actual fault or privity, by fire on board the ship, or by the robbery or embezzlement of or making away with gold or silver or jewellery, the true nature and value of which have not been declared in writing at the time of shipment; and, further, the shipowner is not laable for damage to or loss of goods or merchandise beyond an aggregate amount, not exceeding eight pounds per ton for each ton of the ship's tonnage.  The shipowner is bound by an implied undertaking, or, in other words, is made responsible by the law as if he had entered into an express undertaking: (1) that the ship is seaworthy; (2) that she shall proceed upon the voyage with reasonable despatch, and shall not deviate without necessity from the usual course of the voyage. 

It is not our purpose in this article to discuss minute or doubtful questions; but in their general outline the obligations of shipper and shipowner, where no terms of carriage have been agreed, except as to the freight and destination of the goods, are such as have been described above.  The importance of appreciating clearly this view of the relations of shipper and shipowner arises from the fact that these fundamental rules apply to all contracts of affreightment, whether by bill of lading, charter-party or otherwise, except in so far as they are modified or negatived by the express terms of the contract. 

Bills of Lading. The document signed by the master or agent for the shipowner, by which are acknowledged the shipment of a parcel of goods and the terms upon which it is to be carried, is called a Bill of Lading.  Very many different forms of bills of lading are used.  For the purpose of illustration the following form (from Mr Scrutton's book on Charter-parties and Bills of Lading) has been selected as a sample:-- 

:&lt;tt&gt;Shipped, in apparent good order and condition by _________ in and upon the good Vessel called the _________ now lying in the port of ________ and bound for ________, with liberty to call at any ports in any order, to sail without Pilots, and to tow and assist Vessels in distress, and to deviate for the purpose of saving life or property; and to be delivered in the like good order and condition at the aforesaid port of _________ unto _______ or to his or their assigns, freight and all other conditions as per Charter Party. The act of God, perils of the sea, fire, barratry of the Master and Crew, enemies, pirates, and thieves, arrests, and restraints of princes, rulers, and people, collisions, stranding, and other accidents of navigation excepted, even when occasioned by negligence, default, or error in judgment of the Pilot, Master, Mariners, or other servants of the Shipowners.&lt;/tt&gt;

:&lt;tt&gt;Ship not answerable for losses through explosion, bursting of boilers, breakage of shafts, or any latent defect in the machinery or hull, not resulting from want of due diligence by the Owners of the Ship, or any of them, or by the Ship's Husband or Manager.&lt;/tt&gt;

:&lt;tt&gt;General Average payable according to York-Antwerp Rules.&lt;/tt&gt;

:&lt;tt&gt;In Witness whereof, the Master or Agent of the said Ship hath affirmed to three Bills of Lading, all of this tenor and date, drawn as first, second and third, one of which Bills being accomplished, the others to stand void.&lt;/tt&gt;

:&lt;tt&gt;Dated in ________ this ________ day of _______ 188_.&lt;/tt&gt;

The bill of lading is an acknowledgment of the shipment of goods in a named vessel for carriage to a specified destination on terms set forth in the document.  It is usually signed by the master of the vessel, but very commonly by the agents of the shipowner or sometimes of the charterers of the vessel.  A vessel may be employed by its owners to earn freight in various ways: (1) It may be placed, as it is said, on the berth as a general ship, to receive cargo from any shippers who may desire to send goods to the port, or one of the ports, to which the vessel is bound.  The mate or chief officer usually superintends the loading, and, as goods are shipped, a mate's receipt is given as an acknowledgment of the shipment.  The mate's receipt is afterwards exchanged for the bill of lading. In the case of a shipment by a general ship the bill of lading is the evidence and memorandum of the contract between the shipowner and the shipper. (2) A shipper may, however, require the whole cargo space of the vessel to carry, for example, a full cargo of grain.  In such a case the vessel will be chartered by the shipowner to the shipper. and the contract will be the charter-party.  Even in such a case a bill or bills of lading will usually be given to enable the shipper to deal more conveniently with the goods by way of sale or otherwise.  By the ancient custom of merchants recognized and incorporated in the law, the bill of lading is a document of title, representing the goods themselves, by the transfer of which symbolical delivery of the goods may be made.  But when a cargo is shipped under a charter party, although bills of lading may be given to the charterer, it is the charter-party, and not the bills of lading, which constitutes the record of the contract between the parties---of charter-parties we shall treat below. (3) There is a third class of case which is a combination of the two with which we have dealt above.  A vessel is very commonly chartered by her owner to a charterer who has no intention to ship and does not ship any cargo on his own account, but places the vessel on the berth to receive cargo from shippers who ship under bills of lading.  The charterer receives the bill of lading freight and pays the charter-party freight, his object being of course to obtain a total bill of lading freight in excess of the chartered freight, and so make a profit.  The master, although he usually remains the servant of the shipowner during the term of the charter-party, acts nevertheless under the directions and on behalf of the charterer in signing bills of lading.  The legal effect of this situation is that shippers who ship goods under bills of lading without knowledge of the terms of the charter-party are entitled to look to the shipowner as the person responsible to them for the safe carriage of their goods.  This right depends essentially on the fact that the master who signs the bills of lading, although in doing so he is acting for the charterer, remains nevertheless the servant of the shipowner, who is not allowed to deny as against third persons, who do not know the relations between the charterer and the shipowner, that his servant, the master of the ship, has the ordinary authority of a master to bind his owner by signing bills of lading. 

The forms of bills of lading vary very much, and their clauses have been the subject of judicial consideration and decision in a vast number of reported cases.  The essential particulars, or at all events those common to all bihs of lading, may be stated as follows: 

#The name of the shipper.
#The name of the ship.
#The place of loading and destination of the ship.
#A description of the goods shipped.
#The place of delivery.
#The persons to whom delivery is to be made.
#The freight to be paid.
#The excepted perils.
#The shipowner's lien.

The description of (1) the shipper and (2) the ship calls for no remark.  The (3) description of the voyage is important, because there is, as we have already explained, an implied undertaking by the shipowner in every contract of carriage not unnecessarily to deviate from the ordinary route of the voyage upon which the goods are received to be carried.  The consequences of a deviation are serious, inasmuch as the shipowner is liable, not only for any loss or damage which the shipper suffers in consequence of the deviation, but for any loss of goods which occurs after the deviation, even though such loss is caused by one of the excepted perils.  The only exception to this rule is that a deviation may be made to save life, but not to save property.  It is, however, very usual to qualify the strictness of this implied undertaking by introducing in the bill of lading certain ''liberties'' to deviate, as, for example, in the form given above, ''liberty to call at any ports in any order, to tow and assist vessels in distress, and to deviate for the purpose of saving life and property.'' The nature and extent of the liberty will depend on the words of the contract.  The inclination of English courts has been to construe clauses giving a liberty to deviate somewhat strictly against the shipowner. 

The (4) importance of the description of the goods shipped and their condition is obvious, as the contract is to deliver them as described and in the like good condition, subject, of course, to the exceptions.  It must, moreover, be noted that, as against the master or person who has himself signed the bill of lading, the statement therein of the goods shipped is absolutely conclusive.  But as against the shipowner, unless he has himself signed the bill of lading, the statement of the goods shipped is not conclusive.  It is evidence as against him that the goods described were shipped, but he is allowed to rebut this evidence by proving, if he can, that the goods mentioned, or some of them, were not in fact shipped. 

As to (5) the place of delivery, very serious questions frequently arise.  Primarily, of course, the shipowner is bound to deliver at the place named.  Should he be prevented by some obstacle or difficulty which is of a temporary nature, the vessel must wait, and delivery must be made as soon as possible.  Where, however, the obstacle is permanent, or at all events such as must cause unreasonable delay, having regard to the nature of the adventure, the shipowner is excused from delivery at the place named in the bill of lading, provided the difficulty arises from an excepted peril, or in consequence of delivery at the place named being forbidden by the law of England, as may happen, for example, in the case of a declaration of war between the [[United Kingdom]] and the state in which the port named in the bill of lading is situate.  A party to a contract cannot be held liable for breaking his contract if its performance has become illegal.  There may be other cases in which, from the circumstances of the voyage and adventure, it must be inferred that the parties intended the performance of the contract to be conditional on the existence at the time of performance of a certain state of things, the non-existence of which would render performance impossible.  For instance, if the port named in the bill of lading became permanently closed and inaccessible to shipping in consequence of an earthquake, it would probably be held that the continued existence of the place named as a port was an implied condition of the contract, and that the shipowner was excused.  Where, however, the performance of the contract remains lawful, and is not excused by the express terms of the contract, or by some implied condition, the shipowner is liable for any loss or damage suffered by the shipper by reason of his goods not being delivered at the named place, even though such delivery has become impossible.  There is another reason why the precise description of the place of delivery often becomes important.  It is only on the arrival of the ship at the place described as the place of delivery that the obligation of the consignee of the goods to take delivery commences.  Delay involves considerable loss and expense to the shipowner.  The shipper or consignee is not responsible for any delay which occurs before the ship has arrived at the place of delivery described in the bill of lading. 

(6) The goods may be deliverable by the terms of the bill of lading to a named consignee, and to him only, but more usually they are made deliverable to the ''order or assigns'' of the named consignee or of the shipper.  If the goods are made deliverable to order or assigns the bill of lading is a negotiable instrument, or, in other words, the right to the goods, and the rights and liabilities under the contract contained in the bill of lading, may be transferred by indorsement and delivery of the document.  When an indorsement has once been made by the shipper or consignee writing his name and nothing more on the back of the bill of lading, the rights in and under it may be transferred from hand to hand by mere delivery.  A bill of lading so indorsed is said to be indorsed ''in blank.'' But the shipper or consignee may restrict the negotiability of the bill of lading by indorsing it not ''in blank,'' but with a direction requiring delivery to be made to a particular person or indorsee, or to his order.  This is called an indorsement ''in full.'' When an indorsement has been made ''in full'' to a named indorsee or order, such indorsee must again indorse ''in blank'' or ''in full'' to effect a new transfer of the rights in the bill of lading. 

(7) The amount or rate of freight payable is stated in the bill of lading, either expressly, or, not uncommonly when the freight under the bill of lading is the same as under the charter-party, by reference to the charter-party.  A common form of such reference is ''freight and other conditions, as per charter-party.'' It may here be mentioned that this form of words does not incorporate in the contract under the bill of lading all the terms and conditions of the charter-party, but only those which apply to the person who is to take delivery, and relate to matters ejusdem generis, or similar to the payment of freight, such as demurrage and the like.  The conditions of the charter-party thus incorporated do not include, for instance, the exceptions in the charter-party so as to add them to the exceptions in the bill of lading.  Freight, unless it is otherwise provided by the contract, is payable only on delivery of the goods at their destination.  If the voyage is interrupted and its completion becomes impossible, the shipowner cannot claim payment of freight even pro rata itineris. He loses his freight altogether.  This is so even when the completion of the voyage is prevented by causes for which the shipowner is not responsible, such as the act of God or the king's enemies, or perils which are within the express exceptions in the bill of lading.  When the voyage is interrupted by accident, and indeed in any case, the goods may, by agreement between the shipowner and the consignee, be delivered at some place short of their destination upon payment of a freight pro rata; that is to say, proportional to the length of voyage accomplished, and such an agreement may be implied in certain circumstances from the conduct of the consignee in taking delivery before they arrive at their destination.  In all such cases it will be a question of fact whether the goods were in fact delivered upon the terms, express or implied, that freight pro rata should be paid.  As a rule such an agreement would not be implied where the shipowner is unable or unwilling to forward the goods to their destination, and the owner of the goods, therefore, has no option but to take delivery where offered. 

When the ship is disabled and cannot proceed, or she is prevented by some obstacle from proceeding to the place of delivery named in the bill of lading, and the shipowner is unwilling or unable to forward the goods by another ship, even though he may be excused for his failure to carry the goods to their destination, he is not entitled to be paid any part of the freight; and the consignee is entitled to have the goods delivered to him either at the place where the vessel has taken refuge in her disabled condition, or, if the obstacle arises without disablement of the vessel, at the place which is nearest and most reasonably convenient at the time and in the circumstances when the further prosecution of the voyage has to be abandoned.  On the other hand, after the goods have been shipped, so long as the shipowner is ready and willing to carry the goods to their destination, or, if the ship is disabled, to forward them to their destination by some other ship without unreasonable delay, the owner of the goods cannot require the goods to be delivered to him at any place short of their destination without payment of the full freight.  Sometimes the freight, either wholly or in part, is made payable in advance. If freight payable in advance has become due, even though the ship is lost before it is paid, it must, in the absence of some special provision to the contrary, still be paid, and freight already paid in advance does not become repayable because the goods do not reach their destination.  If, however, goods upon which freight has been paid in advance are lost, and the shipowner is liable for their loss, the amount of freight paid in advance must be taken into account in assessing the damage recoverable from the shipowner. 

(8) There is no part of the bill of lading which is of greater practical importance or which demands more careful consideration by shipowner and shipper alike than that which sets forth the excepted perils: those perils, or in other words causes of loss, for which the shipowner is to be exempt from liability.  By the common law, as we have seen, the exemption of the carrier, apart from express contract, extended only to loss by the act of God or the king's enemies.  The expression ''act of God'' requires a word of explanation.  It will be sufficient to say that it is not synonymous with force majeure; but it includes every loss by force majeure in which human agency, by act or negligence, has had no part.  The list of excepted perils varies much in different forms of bills of lading.  In the older forms it usually included perils of the seas, robbers and pirates, restraint of princes and rulers, fire and barratry (that is, wilful wrongdoing) of the master and crew.  The list, however, has grown in modern times, and is still growing; the tendency being to exempt the shipowner from liability for all loss which does not arise from his own personal default, or from the negligence of his managers or agents in failing to provide a vessel seaworthy and fit for the voyage at its commencement.  It is important to point out in this connection that there are two duties which the shipowner is always presumed to undertake, and which are assumed to be unaffected and unqualified by the exceptions, unless a contrary intention is very clearly expressed by the terms of the contract.  In the first place, he undertakes absolutely that the ship in which the goods are shipped is fit at the commencement of the voyage for the service to be performed.  If during the voyage loss arises even from dangers of the seas or other excepted peril which would not have occurred if the vessel had been seaworthy and fit for the voyage at its commencement, the shipowner is not protected by the exceptions, and is liable for the loss.  In the second place, there is an implied undertaking by the shipowner that all reasonable care will be taken by himself, his servants and agents, safely to carry and deliver at their destination the goods received by him for carriage.  Should loss or damage occur during the voyage, though the direct cause of such loss or damage be perils of the seas or other excepted peril, still the shipowner cannot claim exemption under the exceptions, if the shipper can prove that the loss or damage would not have occurred but for the negligence of the master or crew, or other servants of the shipowner.  The shipowner, in other words, is bound, with his servants, to use all reasonable care to prevent loss by excepted perils and by any other cause. 

=== Express stipulations. ===

*It must not be supposed that even these primary obligations, which are introduced into every contract of affreightment not by express terms of the contract.
*It has now become common form to stipulate that the shipowner shall not be liable for any loss arising from the negligence of his servants, or that he shall not be liable for loss by the excepted perils even when brought about by the negligence of his servants.
*And with regard to seaworthiness, it is not uncommon for the shipowner to stipulate that he shall not be responsible for loss arising even from the unseaworthiness of the ship on sailing, provided that due care has Been taken by the owner and his agents and servants to make the ship seaworthy at the commencement of the voyage.
*There is indeed no rule of English law which prevents a shipowner from exempting himself by the terms of the bill of lading from liability for damage and loss of every kind, whether arising from unseaworthiness or any other cause whatsoever.
*In such a case the goods are carried at their owner's risk, and if he desires protection he must obtain it by insurance.
*In this respect the law of England permits greater freedom of contract than is allowed by the law of some other states.
*The owners, agents and masters of vessels loading in the [[United States|United States of America]] are forbidden by an act of Congress, commonly called the Harter Act, passed in the year [[1893]], to insert in their contracts of affreightment any clause exempting the shipowner from liability for the negligence of his servants; but it is at the rame time enacted that, provided all reasonable skill and care has been exercised by the shipowner to make the vessel seaworthy and fit for the voyage at its commencement, the shipowner shall not be liable for any loss caused by the negligence of the master or crew in the navigation of the vessel, or by perils of the sea or certain other causes set forth in the act.
*It is now very usual to insert in the bills of lading of [[United Kingdom|British]] vessels loading in the United States a reference to the Harter Act, incorporating its provisions so as to make them terms and conditions of the bill of lading. 

The difficulty of construing the terms of bills of lading with regard to the excepted perils, often expressed in obscure and inexact language, has given rise to much litigation, the results of which are recorded in the law reports.  Where such difficulties arise the question must be, What is the true and natural meaning of the language used by the parties? This question is not governed by the general rules which we have endeavouted to explain: but the words of the contract must always be considered with reference to these rules, which are founded upon the well-established customs of merchants recognized and formulated by the courts of law. 

(9) The bill of lading sometimes contains a clause as to the shipowner's lien. Without any express provision for it the shipowner has by the common law a lien for freight.  If it is desired to give the shipowner a lien for demurrage (see below) or other charges, it must be expressly provided for.  The lien is the right of the shipowner to retain the goods carried until payment has been made of the freight or the demurrage, or other charge for which a lien has been given.  The lien may be waived, and is lost by delivery of the goods, or by any dealing with the consignee which is inconsistent with a right of the shipowner to retain possession of the goods until payment has been made.  The shipowner may preserve his lien by landing the goods and retaining them in his own warehouse, or by storing them in a public warehouse, subject to the conditions required by the Merchant Shipping Act [[1894]]. 

=== Charter-parties. ===

Charter-parties are, as we have already explained, either for a voyage or for a period of time. (1) A charter-party for a voyage is a formal agreement made between the owner of the vessel and the charterers by which it is agreed that the vessel ''being tight, staunch and strong, and every way fitted for the voyage,'' shall load at a certain named place a full cargo either of goods of a specified description or of general merchandise, and being so loaded shall proceed with all possible despatch either to a specified place or to a place to be named at a specified port of call, and there deliver the cargo to the charterers or their assigns.  There are clauses which provide for the amount of freight to be paid and the manner and time of payment; for the time, usually described as lay days, to be allowed for loading and discharging, and for the demurrage to be paid if the vessel is detained beyond the lay days; usually also a clause requiring ''the cargo to be brought to and taken from alongside at merchant's risk and expense''; a clause that the master shall sign bills of lading for the cargo shipped either at the same rate of freight as is payable under the charter-party or very commonly at any rate of freight (but in this case with a stipulation that, if the total bill of lading freight is less than the total freight payable under the charter-party, the difference is to be paid by the charterers to the master before the sailing of the vessel); and there is usually vhat is called the cesser clause, by which the charterer's liability under the charter-party is to cease on shipment of the cargo, the shipowner taking a lien on the cargo for freight, dead freight and demurrage.  The charter-party is made subject to exceptions similar to those which are found in bills of lading.  There are also usually clauses providing for the commissions to be paid to the brokers on signing the charter-party, the ''address'' commission to be paid to the agents for the Vessel at the port of discharge, and other matters of detail.  The clauses in charter-parties vary, of course, indefinitely, but the above is probably a sufficient outline of the ordinary form of a charter-party for a voyage. 

What has been said with regard to bills of lading as to the voyage, the place of delivery, the exceptions and excepted perils, and the liability of the shioowner and his lien applies equally to charter-parties. lt may be desirable to add a few words on demurrage, dead Freight, and on the cesser clause. 

Demurrage is, properly speaking, a fixed sum per day or per hour agreed to be paid by the charterer for any time during which the vessel is detained in loading or discharging over and above the time allowed, which is, as we have said, usually described as the lay days. Sometimes the number of days during which the vessel may be kept on demurrage at the agreed rate is fixed by the charter-party.  If no demurrage is provided for by the charter-party, and the vessel is not loading or discharging beyond the lay days, the shipowner is entitled to claim damages in respect of the loss which he has suffered by the detention of his ship; or, if the vessel is detained beyond the fixed number of demurrage days, damages for detention will be recoverable.  Sometimes there is no time fixed by the charter-party for loading or discharging.  The obligation in such cases is to load or discharge with all despatch that is possible and reasonable in the circumstances; and if the loading or discharging is not done with such reasonable despatch, the shipowner will be entitled to claim damages for detention of his ship.  The rate of demurrage (if any) will generally be accepted as the measure of the damages for detention, but is not necessarily the true measure.  When the claim is for detention and not demurrage the actual loss is recoverable, which may be more or may be less than the agreed rate of demurrage.  The contract usually provides that Sundays and holidays shall be excepted in counting the lay days, but unless expressly stipulated this exception does not apply to the computation of the period of detention after the lay days have expired. 

Dead freight is the name gaven to the amount of freight lost, and therefore recoverable by the shipowner from the charterer as damages if a full and complete cargo is not loaded in accordance with the terms of the charter-party. 

The cesser clause has come into common use because very frequently the charterers are not personally interested in the cargo shipped.  They may be agents merely, or they may have chartered the vessel as a speculation to make a profit upon the bill of lading freight.  The effect of the clause is that when the charterers have shipped a full cargo they have fulfilled all their obligations, the shipowner discharging them from all further liability and taking instead a lien on the cargo for payment of all freight, demurrage or dead freight that may be payable to him.  It has become an established rule for the construction of the cesser clause that, if the language used will permit it, the cesser of liability is assumed to be co-extensive only with the lien given to the shipowner; or, in other words, the charterers are released from those liabilities only for which a lien is given to the shipowner.  The shipowner is further secured by the stipulation already referred to, that if the total freight payable under the bills of lading is less than the full chartered freight the difference shall be paid to the shipowner before the vessel sails.  A difficulty which sometimes arises, notwithstanding these precautions, is that although an ample lien is given by the charter-party, the terms of the bills of lading may be insufficient to preserve the same extensive lien as against the holder of the bills of lading.  The shippers under the bills of lading, if they are not the charterers, are not liable for the chartered freight, but only for the bill of lading freight; and unless the bill of lading expressly reserves it, they are not subject to a lien for the chartered freight.  The master may guard against this difficulty by refusing to sign bills of lading which do not preserve the shipowner's lien for his full chartered freight.  But he is often put into a difficulty by a somewhat improvident clause in the charter-party requiring him to sign bills of lading as presented. See Kruger v. Moel Tryvan, [[1907]] A. C. 272. 

(2) A time charter-party is a contract between the shipowner and charterers, by which the shipowner agrees to let and the charterers to hire the vessel for a specified term for employment, either generally in any lawful trade or upon voyages within certain limits.  A place is usually named at which the vessel is to be re-delivered to the owners at the end of the term, and the freight is payable until such re-delivery; the owner almost always pays the wages of the master and crew, and the charterers provide coals and pay port charges; the freight is usually fixed at a certain rate per gross register ton per month, and made payable monthly in advance, and provision is made for suspension of hire in certain cases if the vessel is disabled; the master, though he usually is and remains the servant of the owner, is required to obey the orders of the charterers as regards the employment of the vessel, they agreeing to indemnify the owners from all liability to which they may be exposed by the master signing bills of lading or otherwise complying with the orders of the charterers; and the contract is made subject to exceptions similar to those in bills of lading and voyage charter-parties.  This is the general outline of the ordinary form of a time charter-party, but the forms and their clauses vary, of course, very much, according to the circumstances of each case. 

It is apparent that under a time charter-party the shipowner to a large extent parts with the control of his ship, which is employed within certain limits according to the wish and directions, and for the purposes and profit of, the charterers.  But, as we have already explained at the beginning of this article, the shipowner continues in possession of his vessel by his servant the master, who remains responsible to his owner for the safety and proper navigation of the ship.  The result of this, as has been already pointed out, is that the holder of a bill of lading signed by the master, if he has taken the bill of lading without knowledge of the terms of the time charter-party, may hold the owner responsible for the due performance of the contract signed by the master in the ordinary course of his duties, and within his ostensible authority as servant of the shipowner, although in fact in signing the bill of lading the master was acting as agent for and at the direction of the time charterer, and not the shipowner.  In the language of the ordinary time charter-party the ship is let to the charterers; but there is no true demise, because, as we have pointed out, the vessel remains in the possession of the shipowner, the charterer enjoying the advantages and control of its employment.  Where the possession of a ship is given up to a hirer, who appoints his own master and crew, different considerations apply; but though the instrument by which the ship is let may be called a charter-party, it is not truly a contract of affreightment. 

=== Customary rights. ===

There are certain rights and obligations arising out of the relationship of shipowner and cargo-owner in circumstances of extraordinary peril or urgency in the course of a voyage, which, though not strictly contractual, are well established by the customs of merchants and recognized by the law.  It is obvious that, when a ship carrying a cargo is in the course of a voyage, the master to some extent represents the owners of both ship and cargo.  In cases of emergency it may be necessary that the master should, without waiting for authority or instructions, incur expense or make sacrifices as agent not only of his employer, the shipowner, but also of the cargo-owner.  Ship and cargo may be in peril, and it may be necessary for the safety of both to put into a port of refuge.  There it may be necessary to repair the ship, and to land and warehouse, and afterwards re-ship the cargo.  For these purposes the master will be obliged to incur expense, of which some part, such as the cost of repairing the ship, will be for the benefit of the shipowner; part, such as the warehousing expenses, will be for the benefit of the cargo-owner; and part, such as the port charges incurred in order to enter the port of refuge, are for the common benefit and safety of ship and cargo.  Again, in a storm at sea, it may be necessary for the safety of ship and cargo to cut away a mast or to jettison, that is to say, throw overboard part of the cargo.  In such a case the master, acting for the shipowner or cargo-owner, as the case may be, makes a sacrifice of part of the ship or part of the cargo, in either case for the purpose of saving ship and cargo from a danger common to both.  Voluntary sacrifices so made and extraordinary expenses incurred for the common safety are called general average (see [[Average]]) sacrifices and expenses, and are made good to the person who has made the sacrifice or incurred the expense by a general average contribution, which is recoverable from the owners of the property saved in proportion to its value, or, in other words, each contributes rateably according to the benefit received.  The law regulating the rights of the parties with regard to such contribution is called the law of General Average.  It must, however, be remembered that the owner of the cargo is entitled under the contract of affreightment to the ordinary service of the ship and crew for the safe carriage of the cargo to its destination, and the shipowner is bound to pay all ordinary expenses incurred for the purpose of the voyage.  He must also bear all losses arising from damage to the ship by accidents.  But when extraordinary expense has been incurred by the shipowner for the safety of the cargo, he can recover such expense from the owner of the cargo as a special charge on cargo; or when an extraordinary expense has been incurred or a voluntary sacrifice made by the shipowner to save the ship and cargo from a peril common to both, he may require the owner of cargo to contribute in general average to make good the loss.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Afghan Turkestan''' is the northern part of [[Afghanistan]], on the border with the former [[Soviet republic]]s of [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Tajikistan]].

Afghan Turkestan is also the name of a former province in this area, which was centred on [[Mazar-e Sharif]] and included territory in the modern provinces of [[Kunduz province|Kunduz]], [[Balkh province|Balkh]], [[Jowzjan province|Jowzjan]] and [[Sar-e Pol province|Sar-e Pol]]. The whole territory, from the junction of the [[Kokcha]] river with the [[Amu Darya]] on the north-east to the province of [[Herat province|Herat]] on the south-west, was some 500 miles in length, with an average width from the Russian frontier to the Hindu Kush of 114 miles (183 km). It thus comprised about 57,000 square miles (148,000 km&amp;sup2;) or roughly two-ninths of the former kingdom of Afghanistan.

==Geography==

The area is agriculturally poor except in the river valleys, being rough and mountainous towards the south, but subsiding into undulating wastes and pasture-lands towards the [[Turkman Desert]].

==Population==

Ethnically and historically Afghan Turkestan is more connected with [[Bukhara]] than with [[Kabul]], of which government it has been a dependency only since the time of [[Dost Mahommed Khan|Dost Mahommed]].  The bulk of the people of the cities are of [[Persians|Persian]] ([[Tajiks]]) and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ([[Uzbek]]) stock, but interspersed with them are Mongol [[Hazara]]s and [[Hinduism|Hindus]] with [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribes in the Amu Darya plains.

==History==

Ancient Balkh or Bactriana was a province of the Achaemenian empire, and probably was occupied in great measure by a race of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] blood.  About [[250 BC]] [[Diodotus of Bactria|Diodotus (Theodotus)]], governor of [[Bactria]] under the [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucidae]], declared his independence, and commenced the history of the Greco-Bactrian dynasties, which succumbed to [[Parthia]]n and nomadic movements about [[126 BC]]. After this came a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] era which has left its traces in the gigantic sculptures at Bamian and the rock-cut topes of Haibak.  The district was devastated by [[Genghis Khan]], and has never since fully recovered its prosperity. For about a century it belonged to the [[Delhi]] empire, and then fell into Uzbeg hands.  In the [[18th century]] it formed part of the dominion of Ahmad Khan Durani, and so remained under his son Timur.  But under the fratricidal wars of Timur's sons the separate khanates fell back under the independent rule of various Uzbek chiefs.  At the beginning of the [[19th century]] they belonged to Bukhara; but under the [[emir]] Dost Mahommed the Afghans recovered Balkh and Tashkurgan in [[1850]], Akcha and the four western khanates in [[1855]], and Kunduz in [[1859]].  The sovereignty over Andkhui, Shibarghan, Saripul and Maimana was in dispute between Bukhara and Kabul until settled by the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1873 in favour of the Afghan claim.  Under the strong rule of [[Abdur Rahman Khan|Abdur Rahman]] these outlying territories were closely welded to Kabul; but after the accession of Habibullah the bonds once more relaxed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Afyonkarahisar''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]] for the ''black [[opium]] castle'') is a city in western [[Turkey]], also known simply as '''Afyon''' (i.e. opium) or as '''Karahisar-i Sahip'''. Older spellings include '''Afium-Kara-hissar''' and '''Afyon Karahisar'''. It is the capital of [[Afyonkarahisar Province|Afyon]] [[Provinces of Turkey|province]]. It is located 250 km south-west of [[Ankara]] along the [[Akar River]] at an elevation of 1 034 meters. It has a population of 128 516 and is an important railroad junction between [[Izmir]], [[Konya]], Ankara and [[Istanbul]]. The region is traditionally the main producer of opium in Turkey, thereby its name. 

Afyon was known as [[Acroënus]] until the reign of the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Leo III]] who after his victory over [[Arab]] besiegers in [[740]] renamed it [[Nicopolis]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] for the ''Victory City''). The [[Seljuk Turks]] changed its name to Kara Hissar (the ''black castle'') after the ancient fortress situated upon a volcanic rock 201 meters above the town. 

It was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Beyazid I]] in [[1392]] but was lost after the invasion of [[Timur Lenk]] in [[1402]]. It was recaptured in [[1428]] or [[1429]]. During the [[Turkish War of Independence]] in the early [[1920s]] it was occupied by Greek forces. After [[1923]] it became a part of the Republic of Turkey.

Apart from the partly ruined fortress which has given the city its name, famous buildings includes the Ulu Camii (Great Mosque) and the Altigöz Bridge, both built by the Seljuks in the [[13th century]]. It is the seat of an [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenian]] [[bishop]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abaye''', (&quot;little father&quot;) the name of a [[Babylonia]]n ''[['amora]]'', born in [[278]]. He was an [[orphan]], and was raised by his uncle, [[Rabbah bar Nachmani]], and his wife. Abaye assumed the position of head of the ''[[yeshiva]]'' of [[Pumbedita]] shortly after the retirement of his uncle. His father, Kaylil, was the brother of Rabbah bar Nachmani, a teacher at the Academy of Pumbedita. Abaye's real name was Nachmani, after his grandfather; but being left an orphan at an early age, he was adopted by his uncle, Rabbah bar Nachmani, who nicknamed him Abaye (&quot;Little Father&quot;), to avoid confusion with his grandfather of the same name, and thenceforth he was known as Abaye, without any other title. It is a curious fact that he perpetuated the memory of his foster-mother, probably a slave in Rabbah's household, by mentioning her name in many popular recipes and dietetic precepts, some of which seem to be based on superstitious notions. He introduced each recipe with the phrase, &quot;My mother told me.&quot; Abaye's teachers were his uncle Rabbah and [[Joseph bar Chama]], both of whom successively became presidents of the Pumbedita Academy. When Joseph died in 333, this dignity was conferred upon Abaye, who retained it until his death some five years later. Rabbah trained him in the application of the dialectic method to halakhic problems, and Joseph, with his stores of traditional lore, taught him to appreciate the value of positive knowledge. Abaye had enormous respect for his uncle, and the ''[[Gemara]]'' records that he used to entertain his uncle by juggling.

Abaye was a master of ''[[Torah]]'' study and the art of teaching ''Torah''. He studied at the ''[[yeshiva]]'' (Torah Academy) of Pumbedita, run by his uncle. There his good friend and study-partner was [[Rava]], with whom he often engaged in debates on various aspects of [[Torah]] Law. The debates between Rava and Abaye are considered classic examples of [[Talmud]]ic discourse. Of their hundreds of recorded disputes, the Law is decided according to the opinion of [[Rava]] in all but six cases. Superior as Abaye no doubt was in his dialectic analysis of halakhic sentences, he was, nevertheless, surpassed in this regard by Raba, with whom he had been closely associated from early youth. To the disputations between these ''amoraim'' we owe the development of the dialectic method in the treatment of halakic traditions. Their debates are known as the ''Hawayot de-Abaye we-Raba'' (Debates of Abaye and Raba), the subjects of which were then considered such essential elements of Talmudic knowledge that by an anachronism they were thought to be known to [[Johanan ben Zakkai]], who lived some centuries before (''Suk.'' 28a). Their halakic controversies are scattered throughout the ''Babylonian Talmud''. With the exception of six of his decisions, the opinions of Raba were always accepted as final. Abaye was never so happy as when one of his disciples had completed the study of a Mishnah treatise. On such occasions he always gave a feast to his pupils (''Shab.'' 118b), though his circumstances were needy, and wine never appeared upon his table. His peace-loving disposition and his sincere piety are well exhibited in his maxims (''Ber.'' 17a), among which occur the following: &quot;Be mild in speech; suppress your wrath; and maintain good-will in intercourse with your relatives as well as with others, even with strangers in the market-place.&quot;

Abaye urged his disciples to conduct themselves in such a way as to lead others to the love of God (''Yoma'', 86a). In Biblical exegesis he was one of the first to draw a distinct line between the evident meaning of the text (''peshaṭ'') and the sense ascribed to it by midrashic interpretation. He formulated the following rule, of great importance in Talmudic exegesis (''Sanh.'' 34a): &quot;One Bible verse can be referred to different subjects, but several different Bible verses can not refer to one and the same subject.&quot; 

He defended the [[apocryphal]] book ''[[Ecclesiasticus]]'' against his teacher Joseph. By quoting from it a number of edifying passages he showed that it did not belong to the heretical books which are forbidden, and even compelled his teacher to admit that quotations might with advantage be taken from it for homiletical purposes (''Sanh.'' 100b). Possessing an extensive knowledge of tradition, Abaye became a most eager disciple of [[Dimi]], the Palestinian ''amora'', who had brought to Babylonia a perfect treasury of interpretations by Palestinian ''amoraim''. Abaye considered Dimi, as a representative of the Palestinian school, a qualified Bible exegete, and used to ask him how this or that Bible verse was explained in &quot;the West,&quot; or Palestine. Of his own interpretations of Biblical passages only a few, of a haggadic nature, are preserved; but he often supplements, elucidates, or corrects the opinions of older authorities.

Abaye was also a ''[[Kohen]]'' (a [[priest]]), descending from the family of [[Eli]], and he was caught up in the curse that was placed on that family by [[God]], that no one would ever live out his full years, because of the desecration of God’s name caused by the misdeeds of Eli’s sons, [[Chofni]] and [[Pinchas]]. Abaye’s righteous behavior staved off the curse for many years but he succumbed to [[edema]] in the year 338 or 339 at the relatively young age of sixty.

:''Rav redirects here. For other uses, see [[RAV (disambiguation)]].''

'''Abba Arika''' (d. [[247]])  was the [[Babylon]]ian ''[['amora]]'' of the [[3rd century]] who established at [[Sura (city)|Sura]] the systematic study of the [[rabbinic]] traditions which, using the ''[[Mishnah]]'' as text, led to the compilation of the ''[[Talmud]]''. He is commonly known as '''Rav''' (or '''Rab''').

==Overview==
His surname, '''Arika''' (English, &quot;Long&quot;— that is, &quot;Tall&quot;; it occurs only once—''Ḥul.'' 137b), he owed to his height, which, according to a reliable record, exceeded that of his contemporaries. Others, reading '''Areka,''' consider it an honorary title, &quot;Lecturer&quot; (Weiss, ''Dor,'' iii. 147; Jastrow, ''Dict.'' s.v.). In the traditional literature he is referred to almost exclusively as '''Rab the Master''' (both his contemporaries and posterity recognizing in him a master), just as his teacher, [[Judah HaNasi|Judah I]], was known simply as Rabbi. He is called Rabbi Abba only in the ''[[tannaitic]]'' literature (for instance, ''Tosefta'', ''Beẓah,'' i. 7), where a number of his sayings are preserved. He occupies a middle position between the ''Tannaim'' and the ''Amoraim'', and is accorded the right, rarely conceded to one who is only an '' 'amora'', of disputing the opinion of a ''tanna'' (''B.B.'' 42a and elsewhere).

Rab was a descendant of a distinguished Babylonian family which claimed to trace its origin to [[Shimei]], brother of [[King David]] (''Sanh.'' 5a; ''Ket.'' 62b). His father, [[Aibo]], was a brother of [[Chiyya]], who lived in [[Palestine]], and was a highly esteemed scholar in the collegiate circle of the patriarch Judah I. From his associations in the house of his uncle, and later as his uncle's disciple and as a member of the academy at [[Sepphoris]], Rab acquired such an extraordinary knowledge of traditional lore as to make him its foremost exponent in his native land. While Judah I was still living, Rab, having been duly ordained as teacher—though not without certain restrictions (''Sanh.'' l.c.)—returned to [[Babylonia]], where he at once began a career that was destined to mark an epoch in the development of Babylonian Judaism.

==Beginning of the Talmudic Age==
In the annals of the Babylonian schools the year of his arrival is recorded as the starting-point in the chronology of the Talmudic age. It was the 530th year of the [[Seleucid]]an and the 219th year of the [[common era]]. As the scene of his activity, Rab first chose [[Nehardea]], where the [[exilarch]] appointed him ''[[agoranomos]]'', or market-master, and Rabbi [[Shela]] made him lecturer (''amora'') of his college (''Yer. B. B.'' v. 15a; ''Yoma,'' 20b). Then he removed to [[Sura]], on the [[Euphrates]], where he established a school of his own, which soon became the intellectual center of the Babylonian Jews. As a renowned teacher of the Law and with hosts of disciples, who came from all sections of the Jewish world, Rab lived and worked in Sura until his death. Samuel, another disciple of Judah I, at the same time brought to the academy at Nehardea a high degree of prosperity; in fact, it was at the school of Rab that Jewish learning in Babylonia found its permanent home and center. Rab's activity made Babylonia independent of Palestine, and gave it that predominant position which it was destined to occupy for several centuries.

==Rab as Teacher==
The method of treatment of the traditional material to which the Talmud owes its origin was established in Babylonia by Rab. That method takes the ''Mishnah'' of Judah ha-Nasi as a text or foundation, adding to it the other ''tannaitic'' traditions, and deriving from all of them the theoretical explanations and practical applications of the religious Law. The legal and ritual opinions recorded in Rab's name and his disputes with Samuel constitute the main body of the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. His numerous disciples—some of whom were very influential and who, for the most part, were also disciples of Samuel—amplified and, in their capacity as instructors and by their discussions, continued the work of Rab. In the Babylonian schools, Rab was rightly referred to as &quot;our great master.&quot; Rab also exercised a great influence for good upon the moral and religious conditions of his native land, not only indirectly through his disciples, but directly by reason of the strictness with which he repressed abuses in matters of [[marriage]] and [[divorce]], and denounced ignorance and negligence in matters of [[ritual observance]].

==Ethical Teaching==
Rab, says tradition, found an open, neglected field and fenced it in (''Ḥul.'' 110a). Special attention was given by him to the [[liturgy]] of the [[synagogue]]. He is reputed to be the author of one of the finest compositions in the Hebrew prayerbook, the ''[[Musaf]]'' service of the [[Rosh Hashanah|New Year]]. In this noble prayer are evinced profound religious feeling and exalted thought, as well as ability to use the [[Hebrew language]] in a natural, expressive, and classical manner (''Yer. R. H.'' i. 57a). The many [[homiletic]] and [[ethical]] (haggadistic) sayings recorded of him show similar ability. As a haggadist Rab is surpassed by none of the Babylonian ''Amoraim''. He is the only one of the Babylonian teachers whose haggadistic utterances approach in number and contents those of the Palestinian haggadists. The [[Palestinian Talmud]] has preserved a large number of his halakic and haggadistic utterances; and the Palestinian ''[[Midrashim]]'' also contain many of his ''haggadot''. Rab delivered homiletic discourses, both in the college (''bet hamidrash'') and in the synagogues. He especially loved to treat in his homilies of the events and personages of Biblical history; and many beautiful and genuinely poetic embellishments of the Biblical record, which have become common possession of the ''[[Haggadah]]'', are his creations. His ''Haggadah'' is particularly rich in thoughts concerning the moral life and the relations of human beings to one another. A few of these utterances may be quoted here: (''Shab.'' 10b)

*&quot;The commandments of the [[Torah]] were only given to purify men's morals&quot; (''Gen. R.'' xliv.). 
*&quot;Whatever may not properly be done in public is forbidden even in the most secret chamber&quot; (''Shab.'' 64b). 
*&quot;It is well that people busy themselves with the study of the Law and the performance of charitable deeds, even when not entirely disinterested; for the habit of right-doing will finally make the intention pure&quot; (''Pes.'' 50b). 
*&quot;Man will be called to account for having deprived himself of the good things which the world offered&quot; (''Yer. Ḳid.'' end). 
*&quot;Whosoever hath not pity upon his fellow man is no child of [[Abraham]]&quot; (''Beẓah,'' 32b). 
*&quot;It is better to cast oneself into a fiery furnace than publicly to put to shame one's fellow creature&quot; (''B. M.'' 59a). 
*&quot;One should never betroth himself to a woman without having seen her; one might subsequently discover in her a blemish because of which one might loathe her and thus transgress the commandment: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself'&quot; (''Ḳid.'' 41a). 
*&quot;A father should never prefer one child above another; the example of [[Joseph]] shows what evil results may follow therefrom&quot;.

==Rab reproves Extreme Asceticism==
Rab loved the ''Book of Ecclesiasticus'' ([[Sirach]]), and warned his disciple [[Hamnuna]] against unjustifiable asceticism by quoting advice contained therein—that, considering the transitoriness of human life ('' 'Er.'' 54a), one should not despise the good things of this world. To the celestial joys of the future he was accustomed to refer in the following poetic words: (''Ber.'' 17a)

:&quot;There is naught on earth to compare with the future life. In the world to come there shall be neither eating nor drinking, neither trading nor toil, neither hatred nor envy; but the righteous shall sit with crowns upon their heads, and rejoice in the radiance of the Divine Presence&quot;.

Rab also devoted much attention to [[mystical]] and [[transcendental]] speculations which the rabbis connect with the Biblical account of creation (''Gen.'' i., ''Ma'aseh Bereshit''), the vision of the mysterious chariot of God (''Ezek.'' i., ''Ma'aseh Merkabah''), and the [[Divine Name]]. Many of his important utterances testify to his tendency in this direction (''Ḥag.'' 12a, ''Ḳid.'' 71a).

==Status in Life==
Concerning the social position and the personal history of Rab we are not informed. That he was rich seems probable; for he appears to have occupied himself for a time with commerce and afterward with agriculture (''Ḥul.'' 105a). That he was highly respected by the [[Gentile]]s as well as by the Jews of Babylonia is proved by the friendship which existed between him and the last [[Parthia]]n king, [[Artaban]] ('' 'Ab. Zarah,'' 10b). He was deeply affected by the death of Artaban (226) and the downfall of the [[Arsacid]] dynasty, and does not appear to have sought the friendship of [[Ardeshir]], founder of the [[Sassanian]] dynasty, although [[Samuel of Nehardea]] probably did so. Rab became closely related, through the marriage of one of his daughters, to the family of the exilarch. Her sons, Mar Ukba and Nehemiah, were considered types of the highest aristocracy. Rab had many sons, several of whom are mentioned in the ''Talmud'', the most distinguished being the eldest, Chiyya. The latter did not, however, succeed his father as head of the academy: this post fell to Rab's disciple Huna. Two of his grandsons occupied in succession the office of exilarch (''resh galuta,'' ''Ḥul.'' 92a).

Rab died at an advanced age, deeply mourned by numerous disciples and the entire Babylonian Jewry, which he had raised from comparative insignificance to the leading position in Judaism (''Shab.'' 110a, ''M. Ḳ.'' 24a).

      <text xml:space="preserve">''' 'Abbahu''', the name of an ''[['amora]]'' who flourished c. 279-320 in [[Eretz Yisrael]]. 'Abbahu encouraged the study of [[Greek language|Greek]] by [[Jew]]s. He was famous as a collector of traditional lore, and is very often cited in the ''[[Talmud]]''.

==Knowledge of Greek Literature==
A celebrated Palestinian '' 'amora'' of the third amoraic generation (about 279-320), sometimes cited as R. Abbahu of [[Caesarea]] (Ḳisrin). His [[rabbinic]] education was acquired mainly at [[Tiberias]], in the academy presided over by R. Johanan, with whom his relations were almost those of a son (''Yer. Ber.'' ii. 4b; ''Giṭ.'' 44b; ''B. B.'' 39a). He frequently made pilgrimages to Tiberias, even after he had become well known as rector of the Caesarean Academy (''Yer. Shab.'' viii. 11a; ''Yer. Pes.'' x. 37c). He was an authority on weights and measures (''Yer. Ter.'' v. 43c). He learned [[Greek language|Greek]] in order to become useful to his people, then under the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ''[[proconsul]]s'', that language having become, to a considerable extent, the rival of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] even in prayer (''Yer. Soṭah,'' vii. 21b); and, in spite of the bitter protest of [[Simon b. Abba]], he also taught his daughters Greek (''Yer. Shab.'' vi. 7d; ''Yer. Soṭah,'' ix. 24c; ''Sanh.'' 14a). Indeed, it was said of 'Abbahu that he was a living illustration of the maxim (''Eccl.'' vii. 18; compare ''[[Targum]]''), &quot;It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this [the study of the Law]; yea, also from that [other branches of knowledge] withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all&quot; (''Eccl. R.'' to vii. 18).

==Rector in Caesarea==
Being wise, handsome, and wealthy (B. M. 84a; Yer. B. M. iv. 9d), Abbahu became not only popular with his coreligionists, but also influential with the proconsular government (Ḥag. 14a; Ket. 17a). On one occasion, when his senior colleagues, Ḥiyya b. Abba, Ammi, and Assi, had punished a certain woman, and feared the wrath of the proconsul, Abbahu was deputed to intercede for them. He had, however, anticipated the rabbis' request, and wrote them that he had appeased the informers but not the accuser. The witty enigmatic letter describing this incident, preserved in the Talmud (Yer. Meg. iii. 74a), is in the main pure Hebrew, and even includes Hebrew translations of Greek proper names, to avoid the danger of possible exposure should the letter have fallen into the hands of enemies and informers (compare 'Er. 53b). After his ordination he declined a teacher's position, recommending in his stead a more needy friend, R. Abba of Acre (Acco), as worthier than himself (Soṭah, 40a). He thereby illustrated his own doctrine that it is a divine virtue to sympathize with a friend in his troubles as well as to partake of his joys (Tan., Wa-yesheb, ed. Buber, 16). Later he assumed the office of rector in Cæsarea, the former seat of R. Hoshaya I., and established himself at the so-called Kenishta Maradta (Insurrectionary Synagogue; Yer. Naz. vii. 56a; Yer. Sanh. i. 18a; compare Josephus, &quot;B. J.&quot; ii. 14, § 5; Jastrow, &quot;Dict.&quot; p. 838), whence some of the most prominent teachers of the next generation issued. He did not, however, confine his activity to Cæsarea, where he originated several ritualistic rules (Yer. Dem. ii. 23a, R. H. 34a), one of which—that regulating the sounding of the shofar—has since been universally adopted, and is referred to by medieval Jewish casuists as &quot;Takkanat R. Abbahu&quot; (the Enactment of R. Abbahu; compare &quot;Maḥzor Vitry,&quot; Berlin, 1893, p. 355). He also visited and taught in many other Jewish towns (Yer. Ber. viii. 12a; Yer. Shab. iii. 5c).

While on these journeys, Abbahu gathered so many Halakot that scholars turned to him for information on mooted questions (Yer. Shab. viii. 11a; Yer. Yeb. i. 2d). In the course of these travels he made a point of complying with all local enactments, even where such compliance laid him open to the charge of inconsistency (Yer. Ber. viii. 12a; Yer. Beẓah, i. 60d). On the other hand, where circumstances required it, he did not spare even the princes of his people (Yer. 'Ab. Zarah, i. 39b). Where, however, the rigorous exposition of laws worked hardship on the masses, he did not scruple to modify the decisions of his colleagues for the benefit of the community (Shab. 134b; Yer. Shab. xvii. 16b; Yer. M. Ḳ. i. 80b). As for himself, he was very strict in the observance of the laws. On one occasion he ordered some Samaritan wine, but subsequently learning that there were no longer any strict observers of the dietary laws among the Samaritans, with the assistance of his colleagues, Ḥiyya b. Abba, Ammi, and Assi, he investigated the report, and, ascertaining it to be well founded, did not hesitate to declare the Samaritans, for all ritualistic purposes, Gentiles (Yer. 'Ab. Zarah, v. 44d; Ḥul. 6a).

==Abbahu and Ḥiyya b. Abba==
R. Abbahu's chief characteristic seems to have been modesty. While lecturing in different towns, he met R. Ḥiyya b. Abba, who was lecturing on intricate halakic themes. As Abbahu delivered popular sermons, the masses naturally crowded to hear him, and deserted the halakist. At this apparent slight, R. Ḥiyya manifested chagrin, and R. Abbahu hastened to comfort him by comparing himself to the pedler of glittering fineries that always attracted the eyes of the masses, while his rival was a trader in precious stones, the virtues and values of which were appreciated only by the connoisseur. This speech not having the desired effect, R. Abbahu showed special respect for his slighted colleague by following him for the remainder of that day. &quot;What,&quot; said Abbahu, &quot;is my modesty as compared with that of R. Abba of Acre (Acco), who does not even remonstrate with his interpreter for interpolating his own comments in the lecturer's expositions.&quot; When his wife reported to him that his interpreter's wife had boasted of her own husband's greatness, R. Abbahu simply said, &quot;What difference does it make which of us is really the greater, so long as through both of us heaven is glorified?&quot; (Soṭah, 40a). His principle of life he expressed in the maxim, &quot;Let man ever be of the persecuted, and not of the persecutors; for there are none among the birds more persecuted than turtle-doves and pigeons, and the Scriptures declare them worthy of the altar&quot; (B. Ḳ. 93a).

R. Abbahu, though eminent as a halakist, was more distinguished as a haggadist and controversialist. He had many interesting disputes with the Christians of his day (Shab. 152b; Sanh. 39a; 'Ab. Zarah, 4a). Sometimes these disputes were of a jocular nature. Thus, a heretic bearing the name of Sason (=Joy) once remarked to him, &quot;In the next world your people will have to draw water for me; for thus it is written in the Bible (Isa. xii. 3), 'With joy shall ye draw water.'&quot; To this R. Abbahu replied, &quot;Had the Bible said 'for joy' [le-sason], it would mean as thou sayest; but since it says 'with joy' [be-sason], it means that we shall make bottles of thy hide and fill them with water&quot; (Suk. 48b). These controversies, though forced on him, provoked resentment; and it is even related that his physician, Jacob the Schismatic (Minaah), was slowly poisoning him, but R. Ammi and R. Assi discovered the crime in time ('Ab Zarah, 28a).

Abbahu had two sons, Zeira and Ḥanina. Some writers ascribe to him a third son, Abimi (Bacher,&quot;Ag. Pal. Amor.&quot;). Abbahu sent Ḥanina to the academy at Tiberias, where he himself had studied; but the lad occupied himself with the burial of the dead, and on hearing of this, the father sent him a reproachful message in this laconic style: &quot;Is it because there are no graves in Cæsarea (compare Ex. xiv. 11) that I have sent thee off to Tiberias? Study must precede practise&quot; (Yer. Pes. iii. 30b). Abbahu left behind him a number of disciples, the most prominent among whom were the leaders of the fourth amoraic generation, R. Jonah and R. Jose. At Abbahu's death the mourning was so great that it was said, &quot;Even the statues of Cæsarea shed tears&quot; (M. Ḳ. 25b; Yer. 'Ab. Zarah, iii. 42c).

There are several other Abbahus mentioned in the Talmudim and Midrashim, prominent among whom is Abbahu (Abuha, Aibut) b. Ihi (Ittai), a Babylonian halakist, contemporary of Samuel and Anan ('Er. 74a), and brother of Minyamin (Benjamin) b. Ihi. While this Abbahu repeatedly applied to Samuel for information, Samuel in return learned many Halakot from him (Naz. 24b; B. M. 14a, 75a; see Benjamin b. Ihi).

&quot;When does your Messiah come?&quot; a Christian (Minaah) once asked Abbahu in a tone of mockery; whereupon he replied: &quot;When you will be wrapped in darkness, for it says, 'Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the nations; then shall the Lord rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen on thee' [Isa. lx. 2],&quot; (Sanh. 99a). A Christian came to Abbahu with the quibbling question: &quot;How could your God in His priestly holiness bury Moses without providing for purificatory rites, yet oceans are declared insufficient?&quot; (Isa. xl. 12). &quot;Why,&quot; said Abbahu, &quot;does it not say, 'The Lord cometh with fire'?&quot; (Isa. lxvi. 15). &quot;Fire is the true element of purification, according to Num. xxi. 23,&quot; was his answer (Sanh. 39a). Another question of the same character: &quot;Why the boastful claim: 'What nation on earth is like Thy people Israel' (II Sam. vii. 23), since we read, 'All the nations are as nothing before Him'?&quot; (Isa. xl. 17), to which Abbahu replied: &quot;Do we not read of Israel, he 'shall not be reckoned among the nations'?&quot; (Num. xxiii. 9, Sanh. as above). Abbahu made a notable exception with reference to the Tosefta's statement that the Gilionim (Evangels) and other books of the Mineans are not to be saved from a conflagration on Sabbath: &quot;the books of those at Abidan may be saved&quot; (Shab. 116a). Of special historical interest is the observation of Abbahu in regard to the benediction &quot;Baruk Shem Kebod Malkuto&quot; (Blessed be the Name of His glorious Kingdom) after the &quot;Shema' Yisrael,&quot; that in Palestine, where the Christians look for points of controversy, the words should be recited aloud (lest the Jews be accused of tampering with the unity of God proclaimed in the Shema'), whereas in the Babylonian city of Nehardea, where there are no Christians, the words are recited with a low voice (Pes. 56a). Preaching directly against the Christian dogma, Abbahu says: &quot;A king of flesh and blood may have a father, a brother, or a son to share in or dispute his sovereignty, but the Lord saith, 'I am the Lord thy God! I am the first; that is, I have no father, and I am the last; that is, I have no brother, and besides me there is no God; that is, I have no son'&quot; (Isa. xliv. 6; Ex. R. 29). His comment on Num. xxiii. 19 has a still more polemical tone: &quot;God is not a man that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent. If a man say, 'I am God,' he lieth, and if he say, 'I am the son of man,' he will have to repent, and if he say, 'I shall go up to heaven,' he will not do it, nor achieve what he promises&quot; (Yer. Ta'anit, ii. 65b).

Some of his controversies on Christian theological subjects, as on Adam (Yalḳ., Gen. 47), on Enoch (Gen. R. 25), and on the resurrection (Shab. 152b), are less clear and direct (see Bacher, &quot;Ag. Pal. Amor.&quot; ii. 97, 115-118).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abbreviators''', a body of writers in the papal [[chancery]], whose business was to sketch out and prepare in due form the [[papal bull|pope's bulls]], [[Papal brief|brief]]s and [[consistory|consistorial]] decrees before these are written out ''in extenso'' by the ''scriptores''.

They are first mentioned in the [[papal bull]]s ''Extravagantes'' of [[Pope John XXII]] and of [[Pope Benedict XII]]. Their number was fixed at seventy-two by [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. From the time of [[Pope Benedict XII]] ([[1334]]-[[1342]]) they were classed as ''de Parco majori'' or ''Praesidentiae majoris'', and ''de Parco minori''. The name was derived from a space in the chancery, surrounded by a grating, in which the officials sat, which is called higher or lower (major or minor) according to the proximity of the seats to that of the vice-[[chancellor]].

After the [[protonotary|protonotaries]] left the sketching of the minutes to the abbreviators, those ''de Parco majori'', who ranked as [[prelate]]s, were the most important officers of the [[apostolic]] chancery. By the time of [[Pope Martin V]] their signature was made essential to the validity of the acts of the chancery; and they obtained in course of time many important privileges.

They were suppressed in [[1908]] by [[Pope Pius X]] and their duties were transferred to the ''protonotarii apostolici participantes''. (See [[Curia Romana]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abdallatif''', '''Abd-el-latif''' or '''Abd-Ul-Latif''' ([[1162]]-[[1231]]), a celebrated [[physician]] and traveller, and one of the most voluminous writers of the East, was born at [[Baghdad]].

An interesting memoir of Abdallatif, written by himself, has been preserved with additions by [[Ibn Abu-Osaiba]] (Ibn abi Usaibia), a contemporary. From that work we learn that the higher education of the youth of Baghdad consisted principally in a minute and careful study of the rules and principles of [[grammar]], and in their committing to memory the whole of the ''[[Qur'an]]'', a treatise or two on [[philology]] and [[jurisprudence]], and the choicest Arabian poetry.

After attaining to great proficiency in that kind of learning, Abdallatif applied himself to natural philosophy and medicine. To enjoy the society of the learned, he went first to [[Mosul]] ([[1189]]), and afterwards to [[Damascus]]. With letters of recommendation from [[Saladin]]'s [[vizier]], he visited [[Egypt]], where he realized his wish to converse with [[Maimonides]], ''the Eagle of the Doctors''.

He afterwards formed one of the circles of learned men whom Saladin gathered around him at [[Jerusalem]]. He taught [[medicine]] and [[philosophy]] at [[Cairo]] and at Damascus for a number of years, and afterwards, for a shorter period, at [[Aleppo]].

His love of travel led him  to visit different parts of [[Armenia]] and [[Asia Minor]] in his old age. Also, he was in the process of setting out on a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] when he died at Baghdad.

Abdallatif was undoubtedly a man of great knowledge and of an inquisitive and penetrating mind. Of the numerous works (mostly on medicine) which Osaiba ascribes to him, one only, his graphic and detailed ''Account of Egypt'' (in two parts), appears to be known in [[Europe]]. The manuscript, discovered by [[Edward Pococke]] the [[orientalist]], and preserved in the [[Bodleian Library]], contains a vivid description of a [[famine]] caused, during the author's residence in Egypt, by the [[Nile]] failing to overflow its banks. It was translated into [[Latin language|Latin]] by Professor White of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in [[1800]], and into [[French language|French]], with valuable notes, by [[Silvestre de Sacy]] in [[1810]].

'''Abd ar-Rahman I''' (ruled [[756]]-[[788]]) was the founder of a [[Muslim]] dynasty that ruled [[Spain]] for nearly three centuries. He was a grandson of [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]], the tenth [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph]]. When the [[Umayyads]] were overthrown in the East by the [[Abbasids]] he was a young man of about twenty years of age. Together with his brother Yahya, he took refuge with [[Bedouin]] tribes in the desert. The Abbasids hunted their enemies down without mercy. Their soldiers overtook the brothers; Yahya was slain, and Abd-ar-Rahman saved himself by fleeing first to [[Syria]] and then to northern [[Africa]], the common refuge of all who endeavoured to get beyond the reach of the Abbasids.

In the general confusion of the caliphate produced by the change of dynasty, [[Africa]] had fallen into the hands of local rulers, formerly [[emir]]s or lieutenants of the Umayyad caliphs, but now aiming at independence. After a time Abd ar-Rahman found that his life was threatened, and he fled farther west, taking refuge among the [[Berber]] tribes of [[Mauritania]]. In the midst of all his perils, which read like stories from the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'', Abd-ar-Rahman had been encouraged by reliance on a prophecy of his great-uncle Maslama that he would restore the fortune of the family. He was followed in all his wanderings by a few faithful clients of the Umayyads. 

In [[755]] he was in hiding near [[Ceuta]], and from there he sent an agent over to [[Spain]] to ask for the support of other clients of the family, descendants of the conquerors of Spain, who were numerous in the province of Elvira, the modern [[Granada]]. The country was in a state of confusion under the weak rule of the Emir Yusef, a mere puppet in the hands of a faction, and was torn by tribal dissensions among the [[Arab]]s and by race conflicts between the Arabs and Berbers. It offered Abd ar-Rahman the opportunity he had failed to find in Africa. On the invitation of his partisans he landed at [[Almunecar]], to the east of [[Málaga]], in September 755. 

For a time Abd ar-Rahman was compelled to submit to be guided by his supporters, who were aware of the risks of their venture. Yusef opened negotiations, and offered to give Abd-ar-Rahman one of his daughters in marriage and a grant of land. This was far less than the prince meant to obtain, but he would probably have been forced to accept the offer for want of a better one if the insolence of one of Yusef's messengers, a Spanish renegade, had not outraged a chief partisan of the Umayyad cause. He taunted this gentleman, Obeidullah by name, with being unable to write good [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Under this provocation Obeidullah drew his sword.  

During [[756]], a campaign was fought in the valley of the [[Guadalquivir]], which ended, on [[May 16]], in the defeat of Yusef outside [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]. Abd ar-Rahman's army was so ill provided that he mounted almost the only good war-horse in it; he had no banner, and one was improvised by unwinding a green [[turban]] and binding it round the head of a spear. The turban and the spear became the banner of the Spanish Umayyads.  

The long reign of Abd ar-Rahman was spent in a struggle to reduce his anarchical [[Arab]] and [[Berber]] subjects to order. They had never meant to give themselves a master, and they chafed under his hand, which grew continually heavier. In [[763]] he was compelled to fight at the very gate of his capital with rebels acting on behalf of the Abbasids, and had won a signal victory; he cut off the heads of the leaders, filled them with [[salt]] and [[camphor]] and sent them in defiance to the eastern caliph.  

In his final years, Abd ar-Rahman had to contend with a succession of palace conspiracies, which he repressed brutally. Nevertheless, the dynasty he founded secured Umayyad control of Spain until [[1031]].

'''Abd ar-Rahman II''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: عبد الرحمن الثاني) &amp;lrm; ([[788]]-[[852]]) was an Arab-Spanish ruler. The son of [[Emir]] [[Al-Hakam I]], he became Emir of [[Córdoba, Spain]] in [[822]] and engaged in nearly continuous warfare against [[Alfonso II of Asturias]], whose southward advance he halted ([[822]]-[[842]]). In [[837]] he suppressed a revolt of [[Christians]] and [[Jew]]s in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and repulsed an assault by [[Scandinavia]]n sea rovers in [[844]], and afterwards constructed a fleet and naval [[arsenal]] at [[Seville]] to repel future raids. Famous for his public building program in Córdoba, he died there in 852. A vigorous and effective frontier warrior, he was also well-known as a patron of the arts.  He was also involved in the execution of [[Christians]] who blasphemed the name of [[Allah]].  Those killed are known as the [[Martyrs of Cordoba]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For indivduals with the same or similar name, see [[Abd-ar-Rahman]]''

'''Abd-ar-Rahman III, ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''عبد الرحمن الثالث ''')  ''' [[Emir of Cordoba|Emir]] and [[Caliph of Cordoba]] ([[912]]-[[961]]) was the greatest and most successful of the princes of the [[Ummayads|Ummayad]] dynasty in [[Spain]]. He ascended the throne when he was barely twenty-two and reigned for half a century. His life was so completely identified with the government of the state that he offers less material for biography than his ancestor [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]]. Abd-ar-Rahman III was the grandson of his predecessor, [[Abdallah ibn Muhammad|Abdullah]], one of the [[Spain|Spanish]] Umayyads.

Abd-ar-Rahman came to the throne when the country was exhausted by more than a generation of tribal conflict among the [[Arabs]], and of strife between them and the Muslims of native Spanish descent. Spaniards who were openly or secretly [[Christianity|Christians]] had acted with the [[renegade]]s. These elements, which formed the bulk of the population, were not averse from supporting a strong ruler who would protect them against the Arab [[aristocracy]]. These restless nobles were the most serious of Abd-ar-Rahman's enemies. Next to them came the [[Fatimids]] of [[Egypt]] and northern [[Africa]], who claimed the [[caliphate]] based on descent from the Prophet [[Muhammad]], and who aimed at extending their rule over the [[Muslim]] world. Abd-ar-Rahman subdued the nobles by means of a mercenary army consisting of [[Slavic peoples|Slav]]s.  

He repelled the Fatimids, partly by supporting their enemies in [[Africa]], and partly by claiming the caliphate for himself. In the [[10th century]] Abd-ar-rahman III declared himself as the Caliphate of Cordoba, effectively breaking all ties with the [[History of early Arab Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[History of Syria|Syrian]] caliphs. His ancestors in [[Spain]] had been content with the title of [[sultan]]. The caliphate was thought only to belong to the prince who ruled over the sacred cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. But the force of this tradition had been so far weakened that Abd-ar-Rahman could proclaim himself caliph on [[January 16]], [[929]], and the assumption of the title gave him increased prestige with his subjects, both in [[Spain]] and Africa. 

After he was defeated by the Christians at [[Alhandega]] in [[939]] through the treason of the Arab nobles in his army (see [[History of Spain]]) he never again took the field.

'''Abd ar-Rahman IV Mortada''' ('''عبدالرحمن''') was the [[Caliph of Cordoba]] in the [[Umayyad]] dynasty in [[Spain]], succeeding [[Suleiman II]], in [[1017]]. That same year, he was murdered at [[Cadiz]] while fleeing from a battle in which he had been deserted by the very supporters which had brought him into power. His brief reign was similar to that of [[Abd ar-Rahman V|Abd ar-Rahman V Mostadir]].

({{lang-ar|عبد الرحمن الخامس}})
In the agony of the [[Umayyad]] dynasty in [[Spain]], two princes of the house were proclaimed [[Caliph of Cordoba]] for a very short time, '''[[Abd-ar-Rahman IV]]''' Mortada ([[1017]]), and '''Abd-ar-Rahman V''' Mostadir ([[1023]]-[[1024]]). Both were the mere puppets of factions, who deserted them at once. Abd-ar-Rahman IV was murdered the same year he was proclaimed at [[Cadiz]], in flight from a battle in which he had been deserted by his supporters. Abd-ar-Rahman V was proclaimed caliph in December [[1023]] at [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], and murdered in January [[1024]] by a mob of unemployed workmen, headed by one of his own cousins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Sultan abd-ul-aziz.jpg|thumb|Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz]]

'''Abd-ul-aziz''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: عبد العزيز ) ([[February 9]], [[1830]] &amp;ndash; [[1876]]) was the [[sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from [[1861]] to [[May 30]], [[1876]]. He was the son of Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and succeeded his brother [[Abd-ul-Mejid]] in [[1861]]. 

His personal interference in government affairs was not very marked, and extended to little more than taking astute advantage of the constant issue of state loans during his reign to acquire wealth, which was squandered in building useless palaces and in other futile ways: he is even said to have profited, by means of ''bear'' sales, from the default on the Turkish debt in [[1875]] and the consequent fall in prices.

Another source of revenue was afforded by [[Ismail Pasha]], the ''[[khedive]]'' of [[Egypt]], who paid heavily in ''bakshish'' for the ''firman'' of [[1866]], by which the succession to the khedivate was made [[hereditary]] from father to son in direct line and in order of [[primogeniture]], as well as for the subsequent ''firmans'' of [[1867]], [[1869]] and [[1872]] extending the ''khedive'''s prerogatives. It is, however, only fair to add that the sultan was doubtless influenced by the desire to bring about a similar change in the succession to the Ottoman throne and to ensure the succession after him of his eldest son, [[Yussuf Izz-ed-din]].  

Abd-ul-Aziz visited Western [[Europe]] in [[1867]], being the first Ottoman sultan to do so, including a visit to England, where he was made a [[Knight of the Garter]] by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and shown a [[Fleet Review, Royal Navy#Queen Victoria|Royal Navy Fleet Review]] with his [[Ismail of Egypt|Khedive of Egypt]]. He travelled by private rail car, which today can be found in the [[RMK Museum]] in [[Istanbul]]. In [[1869]] he received visits from [[Empress Eugenie]] of [[France]] and other foreign monarchs on their way to the opening of the [[Suez Canal]]. The future [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]], while [[Prince of Wales]], twice visited [[Istanbul]].

The misgovernment and financial straits of the country brought on the outbreak of [[Muslim]] discontent and [[fanaticism]] which eventually culminated in the murder of two [[consul]]s at [[Salonica]] and in the &quot;[[Bulgarian]] atrocities&quot;, and cost Abd-ul-Aziz his throne. His deposition on [[May 30]], [[1876]] was hailed with joy throughout Turkey; a fortnight later he was found dead in the palace where he had been confined, and trustworthy medical evidence attributed his death to [[suicide]] although many people believed he was murdered by a conspiracy.

Seven children survived him:
# Prince Yussuf Izz-ed-din (b. [[1857]])
# Princess Salina, wife of Kurd Ismail Pasha
# Princess Nazime, wife of Khalid Pasha
# Prince [[Abdul Mejid II]] (b. [[May 29]], [[1868]])
# Prince Self-ed-din (b. [[1876]])
# Princess Emine, wife of Mahommed Bey
# Prince Shefket, ([[1872]]&amp;ndash;[[1899]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abdera''' was an ancient seaport town on the south coast of [[Spain]], between [[Malaca]] (now [[Málaga]]) and [[Carthago Nova]] (now [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]), in the district inhabited by the [[Bastuli]].

It was founded by the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] as a trading station, and after a period of decline became under the Romans one of the more important towns in the province of [[Hispania Baetica]]. It was situated on a hill above the modern [[Adra]].

Of its coins the most ancient bear the [[Phoenicia|Phoenician]] inscription ''abdrt'' with the head of [[Heracles]] (Melkarth) and a [[tuna|tunny-fish]]; those of [[Tiberius]] (who seems to have made the place a colony) show the chief temple of the town with two tunny-fish erect in the form of columns.

'''Abdera''' was a town on the coast of [[Thrace]] near the mouth of the [[Nestos]], and almost opposite [[Thasos]].

Its mythical foundation was attributed to [[Heracles]], its historical to a colony from [[Clazomenae]] in the [[7th century BC]]. But its prosperity dates from [[544 BC]], when the majority of the people of [[Teos]] migrated to Abdera after the [[Ionian Revolt]] to escape the [[Iran|Persia]]n yoke ([[Herodotus]] i.168); the chief coin type, a ''gryphon'', is identical with that of Teos; the coinage is noted for the beauty and variety of its reverse types.

The town seems to have declined in importance after the middle of the [[4th century BC]]. The air of Abdera was proverbial as causing stupidity; but among its citizens was the philosopher [[Democritus]], [Protagoras]] and [[Hecataeus of Abdera]] historian and Sceptic philosopher. The ruins of the town may still be seen on [[Cape Balastra]]; they cover seven small hills, and extend from an eastern to a western harbour; on the southwestern hills are the remains of the medieval settlement of [[Polystylon]]. The city was a member of the [[Delian League]].

Abdera is a [[titular see]] in the province of [[Rhodope]] on the southern coast of Thrace, now called [[Bouloustra]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Apollos''' (&amp;Alpha;&amp;pi;&amp;omicron;&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;&amp;omega;&amp;sigmaf;; contracted from Apollonius) was an early [[Christianity|Christian]], who is mentioned several times in the [[New Testament]]. His special gifts in presenting Christian doctrine made him an important person in the congregation at [[Corinth, Greece]] after Paul's first visit there ([[1 Corinthians]] 3:6).  He was with Paul at a later date in Ephesus (1 Cor. 16:12).  In 1 Cor. 1:10-12 we read of four parties in the Corinthian church, of which two attached themselves to Paul and Apollos respectively, using their names, though the &quot;division&quot; can hardly have been due to conflicting doctrines, and there is no indication that Apollonius favored or approved an overestimation of his person.

[[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] considered Apollos to be a valuable helper in carrying on his work in the important Corinthian congregation (1 Cor. 3:6, 4:6, 16:12).  In harmony with Paul's notices are the statements of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] (18:24-28) that Apollos was a highly educated [[Alexandria]]n [[Jew]], who came to [[Ephesus]] (probably in [[54]]), was instructed more accurately in the gospel there by [[Aquila (bible)|Aquila]] and [[Priscilla_%28Christian%29|Priscilla]] and afterwards settled in [[Achaia]], where he showed himself useful to the Church by speaking and teaching with power and success.

It is difficult to get a correct idea of his religious standpoint; but it probably was that of the so-called disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Acts 19:1-7). Taken all in all, it may be said that Apollos was a zealous missionary, who, while confessing [[Jesus]], did not have the full New Testament revelation, and stood in danger of becoming antagonistic to the apostolic message to all the world; he became, however, an adherent of the Pauline doctrine, and the author of the Acts of the Apostles thought this fact of sufficient importance to be included in his history. In the [[Epistle to Titus]] (3:13) Apollos is mentioned, with [[Zenas]], as bearer of the letter to Crete. 

Apollos may have captivated his hearers by teaching &quot;wisdom,&quot; as P. W. Schmiedel suggests, in the allegorical style of Philo, and he was evidently a man of unusual magnetic force. There seems to be some contradiction between Acts 18:25 ''a b'' and Acts 18:25 ''c'', 26 ''b c''; and it has been suggested that these latter passages are subsequent accretions. Since Apollos was a Christian and &quot;taught exactly,&quot; he could hardly have been acquainted only with John's baptism or have required to be taught Christianity more thoroughly by Aquila and Priscilla.

[[Martin Luther (religious leader)|Martin Luther]] regarded Apollos as the author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], and many scholars since have shared his view. 

Jerome says that Apollos was so dissatisfied with the division at Corinth, that he retired into Crete with [[Zenas]], a doctor of the law; and that the schism having been healed by Paul's letter to the Corinthians, Apollos returned to the city, and became its bishop. Less probable traditions assign to him the bishopric of Duras, or of Iconium in Phrygia, or of Caesarea.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Legislation of the European Union}}The [[French language|French]]  term '''''acquis''''' (or sometimes '''''acquis communautaire''''')  is used in [[European Union law]] to refer to the total body of EU law accumulated so far. The term is also used to describe laws adopted under the [[Schengen treaty]], prior to its integration into the European Union legal order by the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], in which case one speaks of the ''Schengen acquis''.

==Chapters of the Acquis==
During the process of the [[enlargement of the European Union]], the acquis was divided into 31 chapters for the purpose of negotiation between the EU and the candidate member states for the fifth enlargement (the ten that joined in 2004 plus [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]]). These chapters were:

{|
|-
|
#Free movement of goods
#Free movement of persons
#Freedom to provide services
#Free movement of capital
#Company law
#Competition policy
#Agriculture
#[[Fishery|Fisheries]]
#Transport policy
#Taxation
#[[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]]
#Statistics
#Social policy and employment
#Energy

&lt;li&gt;Financial control
&lt;li&gt;Financial and budgetary provisions
&lt;li&gt;Institutions
&lt;li&gt;Others
&lt;/ol&gt;
|}

For the negotiations with [[Croatia]] and [[Turkey]], the acquis was split up into 35 chapters instead, with the purpose of better balancing between the chapters: dividing the most difficult ones into separate chapters for easier negotiation, uniting some easier chapters, moving some policies between chapters, as well as renaming a few of them in the process:

#Free movement of goods
#[[Freedom of movement for workers]]
#Right of establishment and freedom to provide services
#Free movement of capital
#Public procurement
#Company law
#Intellectual property law
#Competition policy
#Financial services
#Information society and media
#Agriculture and rural development
#Food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy
#Fisheries
#Transport policy
#Energy
#Taxation
#Economic and monetary policy
#Statistics
#Social policy and employment (including anti-discrimination and equal opportunities for women and men)
#Enterprise and industrial policy
#Trans-European networks
#Regional policy and coordination of structural instruments
#Judiciary and fundamental rights
#Justice, freedom and security
#Science and research
#Education and culture

Such negotiations usually involved agreeing transitional periods before new member states needed to implement the laws of the European Union fully and before they and their citizens acquired full rights under the ''acquis''.

==Other uses==
The term ''acquis'' has been borrowed by the [[World Trade Organization]] Appellate Body, in the case ''Japan - Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages'', to refer to the accumulation of [[GATT]] and WTO law (&quot;''acquis gattien''&quot;), though this usage is not well established.

It has been used to describe the achievements of the [[Council of Europe]] (a body unconnected with the European Union):
:The Council of Europe&amp;rsquo;s acquis in standard setting activities in the fields of [[democracy]], the [[rule of law]] and fundamental [[human rights]] and freedoms should be considered as milestones towards the great European political project, and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] should be recognised as the pre-eminent judicial pillar of any future architecture.
''(Section 12, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Resolution 1290)''

It has also been applied to the body of &quot;principles, norms and commitments&quot; of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE):

:Another question under debate has been how the Partners and others could implement the OSCE acquis, in other words its principles, norms and commitments on a voluntary basis.

''Intervention by Ambassador Aleksi Härkönen, Permanent Representative of Finland to the OSCE, Annual Security Review Conference'' [http://www.osce.org/documents/sg/2004/06/3241_en.pdf]

The [[OECD]] introduced the concept of the OECD Acquis in its &quot;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/63/6/32036418.pdf Strategy for enlargement and outreach]&quot;, May 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''air engine''' is an [[emission]]-free [[piston]] [[engine]] using [[Pneumatics|compressed air]] as fuel that was invented by Guy Nègre, a French engineer. 

It uses the expansion of compressed air to drive the pistons in a modified piston engine. Efficiency of operation is gained through the use of environmental heat at normal temperature to warm the otherwise cold expanded air from the storage tank. This non-adiabatic expansion has the potential to greatly increase the efficiency of the machine. The only exhaust gas is cold air (&amp;minus;15 °C), which is also used for [[air conditioning]] in a car. The source for air is a pressurized [[Graphite-reinforced_plastic|carbon-fiber]] tank holding air at 3,000 lbf/in&amp;sup2; (20 [[MPa]]). Air is delivered to the engine via a rather conventional [[injection system]]. Unique crank design within the engine increases the time during which the air charge is warmed from ambient sources and a two  stage process allows improved heat transfer rates.

This engine is used to power an [[urban car]] with room for five passengers and a projected [[range]] of about 100 to 200 miles (160 to 320 km), depending on traffic conditions. The main advantages are: no roadside [[emission]]s, low cost technology, engine uses food oil for lubrication (just about 1 [[litre|liter]], changes only every 30,000 miles (50,000 km)) and integrated air conditioning. Range could be quickly tripled, since there are already carbon fiber tanks which have passed safety standards holding gas at 10,000 lbf/in&amp;sup2; (70 MPa).

The tanks may be refilled in about three minutes at a service station, or in a few hours at home plugging the car into the electric [[grid]] via an on-board compressor. The cost of refilling is projected to be about US$3.

However, the air engine and refueling system, considered as a system, are not pollution free except in special cases, as the electric power generation would have its own environmental costs. One of the special cases is where an operator of such a vehicle installs photovolatic or wind drive electric power generation, quite cost effective if the operator can use time-of-use net metering, where power produced is credited at a higher rate than its use to recharge a vehicle using off-peak rates.

Also, performance and range features noted above are based on theoretical projections based upon experiment, prototype performance, engineering analysis and proposed developments. So far (early July 2004), no information has been forthcoming from the developers or other interested parties as to an actual vehicle that can perform as stated. If successful, the project will definitely advance the state of the art in zero pollution developments, principally because it does not have the limited battery life and consequent periodic battery replacement costs of an electric vehicle. Furthermore, the ability to quickly replenish the energy store in a time comparable to filling the tank of a liquid fuel vechicle will be far superior to anything that a battery electric vehicle can deliver and will enable an operator to make long trips within the availability of fast charging stations.

An '''antacid''' is any substance, generally a base, that counteracts [[gastric acid|stomach acidity]]. It performs a neutralisation reaction. It is taken by mouth to relieve [[heartburn]], sour stomach, or [[acid indigestion]]. Most antacids [[buffer solution|buffer]] [[gastric acid]], raising the [[pH]] to reduce acid damage. If antacids are ineffective, medication ([[H2-receptor antagonist]]s or [[proton pump inhibitor]]s) may relieve the symptoms. Poor response to medication may be a reason to suspect an underlying medical condition.

Examples of antacids are:
* [[Aluminium hydroxide]] (Amphojel&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, AlternaGEL&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) 
* [[Magnesium hydroxide]] (Phillips&amp;#8217;&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; [[Milk of Magnesia]]) 
* Aluminium hydroxide ''and'' magnesium hydroxide (Maalox&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, Mylanta&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) 
* [[Aluminium carbonate]] gel (Basajel&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;)

He was killed shortly after taking the throne by [[Giric of Scotland]], also known as Gregory the Great, who had conspired with Aedh's nephew, [[Eochaid of Scotland]].

Not much is known of Aedh, or even if he was actually the one named by Constantine to hold the throne.  Both Giric and Eochaid ruled jointly following Aedh's death.  

Aedh did marry at some point in his life, but the details, including the date and place of the marriage, and the name of his wife are not known.

Aedh died violently in [[878]] at [[Strathallan]], [[Perth and Kinross]]. He may have been buried at [[Maiden Stone]] in [[Aberdeenshire (unitary)|Aberdeenshire]]. He was succeeded under the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[tanistry]] system by his nephew, Eochaid.

[[Image:Abdulhamid I.jpg|thumb|180px|Sultan Abdul Hamid I]]

'''Abd-ul-Hamid I''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: عبد الحميد الأول) (alternate spellings include '''Abdulhamid''', '''Abdul Hamid''' or '''Abdul-Hamid''') ([[March 20]], [[1725]] &amp;ndash; [[April 7]], [[1789]]), was the 27th [[sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He was the son of sultan [[Ahmed III]] and succeeded his brother [[Mustafa III]] on [[January 21]], [[1774]].

Abdul Hamid was imprisoned for the first forty-three years of his life by his older brother Mustafa as was custom and received his early education from his mother Rabia Semi Sultana, where he studied history and learned calligraphy.

His imprisonment had made him aloof in regards to state affairs as malleable to the designs of his advisors. Yet he was also very religious and a [[pacifism|pacifist]] by nature. At his accession the financial straits of the treasury were such that the usual donative could not be given to the [[Janissary|janissaries]].  War was, however, forced on him, and less than a year after his accession the complete defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] at [[Battle of Kozluja]] led to the [[treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji]] on [[July 21]] [[1774]].

[[Image:Jean-Jecques-Frances Le Barbier c1780 scanned Constantinopole (1996)-Procession of the sultan to the Sultanahmed mosque.png|thumb|180px|left|Coronation]]

In spite of his failures, Sultan Abdul Hamid I was regarded as the most gracious sultan of the Ottomans. He administrated the [[fire brigade]] during the fire in 1782. In Istanbul, he won the admiration of his people as he was so religious that he was called a &quot;Veli&quot; (saint). He also traced a reform policy, followed the governmental administrations closely and worked with statesmen. When he came to the throne, the army asked for gratuity, and the Sultan claimed that; &quot;There is no longer, gratuities in our treasury, all of our soldier sons should learn&quot;. He also began the restoration of the military system. He is credited with better education standards. He tried to renovate the yeniceri corps and the naval forces. He established a new artillery troop. He made a census in the yeniceri corps.

Slight successes against rebellious outbreaks in [[Syria]] and the [[Morea]] could not compensate for the loss of the [[Crimea]], which Russia greatly coveted. War was evident once more in [[1787]], when war was again declared against Russia, joined in the following year by [[Austria]]. The Swedes also joined the conflict on the side of the Ottomans. While the Ottomans held their own in the conflict, they ultimately lost, with [[Ochakov]] falling in [[1788]] to the Russians.

The sultan died four months later at the age of sixty-four. He was buried in Bahcekapi, a tomb he had built for himself. 

His wives were: Ayse Sine-perver Mother Sultana, Naksh-i Dil Mother Sultana, Hatice Ruh-shah, Huma Shah, Ayse, Binnaz, Dilpezir, Mehtabe, Misl-i Na-yab, Mu'teber, Nevres, Mihriban

His sons were: [[Mustafa IV]], [[Mahmud II]], Murad, Nusret, Mehmed, Ahmed, Suleyman 

His daughters were: Esma, Emine, Rabia, Saliha, Alimsah, Durusehvar, Fatma, Meliksah, Hibetullah Zekiye

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Sultan abdul-hamid II.jpg|thumb|Sultan Abdul Hamid II]]

'''Abd-ul-Hamid II''' also '''Abdulhamid''', '''Abdülhamit''',  '''Abdul Hamid''', '''Abd al-Hamid II''', or '''Abdul-Hamid''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: عبد الحميد الثاني) ([[September 21]], [[1842]] &amp;ndash; [[February 10]], [[1918]]) was the last real Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He ruled from [[August 31]], [[1876]] till he was deposed on [[April 27]], [[1909]]. 

==Early years==
He was the son of Sultan [[Abd-ul-Mejid]], and succeeded to the [[throne]] on the deposition of his brother [[Murad V]] on [[August 31]] [[1876]]. He himself was deposed in favor of his brother, [[Mehmed V]] in 1909.

Unlike many other Ottoman rulers, Abdul Hamid II, actually traveled. Nine years before he took the throne he accompanied his uncle [[Sultan]] [[Abd-ul-Aziz]] on his visit to [[England]] and [[France]] in 1867. At his accession some commentators were impressed by the fact that he rode practically unattended to the [[Eyup Sultan Mosque]] where he was given the sword of [[Osman I|Osman]]. He was supposed to have liberal ideas, and some conservatives were inclined to regard him with suspicion as a dangerous reformer. In the event, like many other would-be reformers of the Ottoman Empire, change proved to be nearly impossible. [[Default (finance)|Default]] in the public funds, an empty treasury, the [[Herzegovinian rebellion|1875 insurrection in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the war with [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] and the feeling aroused throughout Europe by the cruelty used in stamping out the [[Bulgarian]] rebellion all proved good reasons not to undertake any significant changes.

The international conference which met at [[Istanbul]] towards the end of 1876 was surprised by the promulgation of a constitution, but the demands of European powers at the conference were rejected. [[Midhat Pasha]], the author of the constitution, was exiled and soon afterwards the constitution was suspended. Early in 1877 the Ottoman Empire went to war with the Russian Empire.
{{main|Russo-Turkish_War%2C_1877-78}} &lt;br /&gt;
The war was a disaster for the Ottomans and the government in Istanbul had to sign a hard treaty (see the [[Treaty of San Stefano]]). However, the terms of the treaty were changed - in favor of the Ottoman government - at [[Berlin]], thanks in the main to British diplomacy.

==Thirty years of failed reform==
The Ottoman government of Sultan Hamid now viewed the united Germany as a possible friend of the empire. German officers (like [[Colmar_Freiherr_von_der_Goltz|Baron von der Goltz]]) were employed to oversee the reorganization of the Ottoman army. German government officials were brought in to reorganize the Ottoman government's finances. Sultan Hamid tried to take more of the reins of power into his own hands, for he distrusted his ministers. 

There were many set-backs. 
* Financial embarrassments forced him to consent to a foreign control over the national debt. In a decree issued in December 1881, many of the revenues of the empire were handed over to the Public Debt Administration for the benefit of (mostly foreign) bondholders. 
* There was also trouble in [[Egypt]], where a discredited ''[[khedive]]'' had to be deposed. Sultan Hamid mis-handled relations with [[Ahmed Urabi|Arabi]] - the end result of this was England gained near total control over Egypt.
* There were problems on the [[Greece|Greek]] frontier and in [[Montenegro]], where the European powers were determined that the decisions of the [[Berlin Congress]] should be carried into effect. 
* The union in 1885 of [[Bulgaria]] with Eastern [[Rumelia]] was another blow. The creation of an independent and powerful [[Bulgaria]] was viewed as a serious threat to the Ottoman Empire. For many years Sultan Hamid had deal with Bulgaria in a way that did not antagonize either Russian or German wishes.
&lt;br /&gt;
Germany's friendship was not disinterested, and had to be fostered with railway and loan concessions. In 1899 a significant German desire, the [[Baghdad Railway]], was given to them.

Over the years Sultan Hamid succeeded in reducing his ministers to the position of secretaries, and he concentrated much of the administration of the Empire into his own hands at [[Yildiz]]. But internal dissension was not reduced. [[Crete]] was constantly in turmoil. The Greeks living within the Ottoman Empire's borders were dissatisfied, as were the Armenians.

Starting around 1890 the [[Armenians]] began clamoring to obtain the reforms promised them at Berlin. Unrest occurred in 1892 and 1893 at [[Marsovan]] and [[Tokat]]. In 1894 a more serious rebellion in the mountainous region of Sassun was ruthlessly stamped out. The European powers demanded protection be given to the Christian Armenians, the eventual grant of which in the autumn of 1895 was the signal, not for actual reform, but for for a series of massacres of Armenians.
{{main|Hamidian_massacres}} &lt;br /&gt;
These massacres extended over many months and throughout [[Asia Minor]], as well as in Istanbul itself. The reforms were nothing more than ink on a page. In a real sense, these massacres were the forerunner to the [[Armenian Genocide]].

[[Crete]] was granted ''extended privileges'', but these did not satisfy the population, which sought unification with Greece. In early in 1897 a Greek expedition sailed to Crete to overthrown Ottoman rule of the island. War followed, in which the [[Ottoman Empire]] was successful (see the [[Greco-Turkish_War_%281897%29]]). But then a few months later [[Crete]] was taken over ''en depot'' by England, France, and Russia. [[Prince George of Greece]] was appointed the ruler and so Crete was lost to the Ottoman Empire. 

Abd-ul-Hamid always resisted the pressure of the European powers to the last moment, in order to seem to yield only to overwhelming force, while posing as the champion of [[Islam]] against aggressive [[Christendom]]. Panislamic propaganda was encouraged; the privileges of foreigners in the Ottoman Empire &amp;mdash; often an obstacle to government &amp;mdash; were curtailed. A new railway to the holy city of [[Medina]] was completed - making the [[Hajj]] somewhat easier - though there was still a 160 mile camel ride to get to [[Mecca]]. Emissaries were sent to distant countries preaching Islam and the ''[[caliph]]'s'' supremacy. During his rule, Sultan Hamid refused [[Theodor Herzl]]'s offers to pay down a substantial portion of the Ottoman debt in exchange for a charter allowing the [[Zionists]] to colonize [[Palestine (region) | Palestine]].

Sultan Hamid's appeals to Muslim sentiment were powerless against widespread disaffection within his Empire due to perennial misgovernment. In [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Yemen]] disturbance was endemic; nearer home, a semblance of loyalty was maintained in the army and among the [[Muslim]] population only by a system of delation and espionage, and by wholesale arrests. After his rule began the Sultan became obsessed by a terror of assassination; he withdrew himself into fortified seclusion in the palace of Yildiz and never left.

==Last year in power==
The national humiliation of the situation in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], together with the resentment in the army against the [[palace]] spies and informers, at last brought matters to a crisis. In the summer of 1908 the [[Young Turk]] revolution broke out and Abd-ul-Hamid, on learning of the threat of the [[Salonica]] troops to march on [[Istanbul]] ([[July 23]]), at once capitulated. On [[July 24|the 24th]] an ''irade'' announced the restoration of the suspended constitution of 1876; the next day, further ''irades'' abolished [[espionage]] and [[censorship]], and ordered the release of [[political prisoner]]s. On [[December 17]], Sultan Hamid opened the Turkish parliament with a speech from the throne in which he said that the first [[parliament]] had been &quot;temporarily dissolved until the education of the people had been brought to a sufficiently high level by the extension of instruction throughout the empire.&quot; This was, of course, an utter lie as no significant educational reforms had taken place over the last 30 years.

The new attitude of the Sultan did not save him from the suspicion of intriguing with the powerful reactionary elements in the state, a suspicion confirmed by his attitude towards the counter-revolution of [[April 13]], [[1909]] known as ''[[31 Mart Olayı]]'', when an insurrection of the soldiers backed by a conservative public upheaval in the capital overthrew the cabinet. The government, restored by soliders from Salonica, decided on Abd-ul-Hamid's deposition, and on [[April 27]] his brother Reshid Effendi was proclaimed Sultan as [[Mehmed V]]. The ex-sultan was conveyed into dignified captivity at [[Salonica]]. Back again in [[İstanbul]] by 1912, he spent his last days studying, carpentering and writing his memoirs in custody at the palace of [[Beylerbeyi]], where he died on February 10, 1918, just a few months before his brother.

==Afterward==
Sultan Hamid was the last real Sultan of the Ottoman Empire but he presided over 33 years of decline. The Ottoman Empire became known as the sick man of Europe. It would have been defeated and broken up if the European powers had choosen to do so. While its European neighbors were making railroads, automobiles, electric lights and even airplanes, the Ottoman empire was unable to develop any industry at all. Every advanced technology they used had to be purchased from the foreigners to the north. The people of the Ottoman empire were mired in poverty and ignorance, their lives essentially unchanged during his years of rule.

Sultan Hamid commissioned thousands of photographs of his empire. Fearful of assassination he did not travel and so photographs provided visual evidence of what was taking place in his realm. The [[Sultan]] presented large gift albums of photographs to various governments and heads of state, including the [[United States]] (William Allen, &quot;The Abdul Hamid II Collection,&quot; History of Photography 8 (1984): 119-45.) and Great Britain (M. I. Waley and  British Library., Sultan  Abdulhamid II Early Turkish Photographs in 51 Albums from the British Library on Microfiche (Zug, Switzerland: IDC, 1987). The American collection is housed in the [[Library of Congress]] and has been digitized [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/ahiiquery.html]

'''Abdül Mecid''' (also with various alternate spellings, including '''Abd-ul-Mejid,''''''Abd ül-Mecid''' and '''Abdülmecit'''; in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] عبد المجيد الأول ) ([[April 23]], [[1823]] &amp;ndash; [[June 25]], [[1861]]) was the [[sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and succeeded his father [[Mahmud II]] on [[July 2]] [[1839]]. His reign was notable for being enervated by internal [[nationalism]] and the incursions of European powers. 

When Abd-ul-Mejid succeeded to the throne, the affairs of the [[Ottoman Empire]] were in an extremely critical state. At the very time his father died, the news was on its way to [[Istanbul]] that the empire's army had been signally defeated at [[Nizip]] by that of the rebel [[Egypt]]ian [[viceroy]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mehemet Ali]]. The empire's fleet was at the same time on its way to [[Alexandria]], where it was handed over to the same enemy by its commander [[Ahmed Pasha]], on the pretext that the young sultan's advisers were sold to [[Russia]]. However, through the intervention of the European powers, Mehemet Ali was obliged to come to terms, and the Ottoman Empire was saved.  

[[Image:Paolo Verona c1840 - scanned Constantinopole (1996)-Abdulmecid I going to mosque.png|thumbnail|left|250px|Abdul Mejid going to mosque]]
In compliance with his father's express instructions, Abd-ul-Mejid immediately carried out the reforms to which Mahmud had devoted himself. In November [[1839]] an edict known as the ''[[Hatt-i-sherif of Gulhane]]'' was proclaimed, consolidating and enforcing these reforms. The edict was supplemented at the close of the [[Crimean War]] by a similar statute issued in February [[1856]]. By these enactments it was provided that all classes of the sultan's subjects should have security for their lives and property; that taxes should be fairly imposed and justice impartially administered; and that all should have full religious liberty and equal civil rights. The scheme met with keen opposition from the [[Muslim]] governing classes and the ''[[ulema]],'' or religious authorities, and was but partially put in force, especially in the remoter parts of the empire; and more than one conspiracy was formed against the sultan's life on account of it.  

The more important measures of reform promoted by Abd-ul-Mejid were:

* the national anthem of the Ottoman Empire was named after him
* the reorganization of the army ([[1843]]&amp;ndash;[[1844]])
* the institution of a council of public instruction ([[1846]])
* the abolition of an odious and unfairly imposed capitation tax
* the repression of slave trading, and 
* various provisions for the better administration of the public service and for the advancement of commerce.  

Another notable reform was that the [[turban]] was officially outlawed for the first time during Abd-ul-Mejid's reign, in favour of the [[Fez (clothing)|fez]]. European fashions were also adopted in full swing by the Court. (The fez itself was to banned after the passing of the &quot;hat law&quot; in [[1925]] by the [[Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey|Republican National Assembly]] which had already abolished the sultanate and proclaimed republic in [[1923]]).

When [[Lajos_Kossuth|Kossuth]] and others sought refuge in [[Turkey]] after the failure of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] rising in [[1849]], the sultan was called on by [[Austria]] and [[Russia]] to surrender them, but &quot;boldly and determinedly&quot; refused. He also would not allow the conspirators against his own life to be put to death. The [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] says of him, &quot;He bore the character of being a kind and honourable man, if somewhat weak and easily led. Against this, however, must be set down his excessive extravagance, especially towards the end of his life.&quot; 

He passed away in [[1861]] and succeeded by his brother, [[Abd-ul-Aziz]], the oldest survivor of the family of [[Osman I|Osman]]. He left several sons, of whom two, [[Murad V]] and [[Abd-ul-Hamid II]], eventually succeeded to the throne. During his reign the reckless system of foreign loans began, carried to excess in the ensuing reign and culminating in default, which led to the alienation of European sympathy from [[Turkey]] and indirectly to the dethronement and death of Abd-ul-Aziz.

'''Abdur Rahman Khan''' (ca. [[1844]] [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] &amp;ndash; [[October 1]], [[1901]]), ''[[amir]]'' of [[Afghanistan]], was the third son of [[Afzul Khan]], who was the eldest son of [[Dost Mahommed Khan]], who had established the [[Barakzai]]'s family dynasty in Afghanistan.

==Background and early career ==

Before his death at [[Herat]], on [[June 9]] [[1863]], Dost Mahommed had nominated as his successor [[Shir Ali Khan of Afghanistan|Shir Ali]], his third son, passing over the two elder brothers, Afzul Khan and [[Azim Khan]]. At first, the new amir was quietly recognized. But after a few months Afzul Khan raised an insurrection in the northern province, between the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains and the [[Oxus River]], where he had been governing when his father died. This began a fierce contest for power between Dost Mahommed's sons, which lasted for nearly five years.

In this war, Abdur Rahman became distinguished for ability and daring energy. Although his father, Afzul Khan, who had none of these qualities, came to terms with the Amir Shir Ali, the son's behaviour in the northern province soon excited the amir's suspicion, and Abdur Rahman, when he was summoned to [[Kabul]], fled across the Oxus into [[Bokhara]]. Shir Ali threw Afzul Khan into prison, and a serious revolt followed in southern Afghanistan.   

The ''amir'' had scarcely suppressed it by winning a desperate battle when Abdur Rahman's reappearance in the north was a signal for a mutiny of the troops stationed in those parts and a gathering of armed bands to his standard. After some delay and desultory fighting, he and his uncle, Azim Khan, occupied [[Kabul]] (March [[1866]]). The ''amir'' Shir Ali marched up against them from [[Kandahar]]; but in the battle that ensued at [[Sheikhabad]] on [[May 10]], he was deserted by a large body of his troops, and after his signal defeat Abdur Rahman released his father, Afzul Khan, from prison in [[Ghazni]], and installed him upon the throne as ''amir'' of Afghanistan. 

Notwithstanding the new ''amir'' 's incapacity, and some jealousy between the real leaders, Abdur Rahman and his uncle, they again routed Shir Ali's forces, and occupied Kandahar in [[1867]]. When Afzul Khan died at the end of the year, Azim Khan became the new ruler, with Abdur Rahman as his governor in the northern province.  But towards the end of [[1868]] Shir Ali's return, and a general rising in his favour, resulted in Abdur Rahman and Azim Khan's defeat at [[Tinah Khan]] on [[January 3]] [[1869]]. Both sought refuge in [[Iran|Persia]], whence Abdur Rahman placed himself under [[Russia]]n protection at [[Samarkand]]. Azim died in Persia in October 1869.

==Period of exile==

Abdur Rahman lived in exile in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]], for eleven years, until the [[1879]] death of Shir Ali, who had retired from Kabul when the [[United Kingdom|British]] armies entered Afghanistan. The Russian governor-general at [[Tashkent]] sent for Abdur Rahman, and pressed him to try his fortunes once more across the Oxus. In March [[1880]] a report reached India that Abdur Rahman was in northern Afghanistan; and the governor-general, [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], opened communications with him to the effect that the British government were prepared to withdraw their troops, and to recognize Abdur Rahman as ''amir'' of Afghanistan, with the exception of Kandahar and some districts adjacent to it. After some negotiations, an interview took place between him and [[Lepel Griffin]], the diplomatic representative at Kabul of the [[India]]n government. Griffin described Abdur Rahman as a man of middle height, with an exceedingly intelligent face and frank and courteous manners, shrewd and able in conversation on the business in hand.

==Reign==

At the ''[[durbar]]'' on [[July 22]], 1880, Abbdur Rahman was officially recognized as ''amir'', granted assistance in arms and money, and promised, in case of unprovoked foreign aggression, such further aid as might be necessary to repel it, provided that he align his foreign policy with the British. The British evacuation of Afghanistan was settled on the terms proposed, and in [[1881]] the British troops also handed over Kandahar to the new ''amir''.  

However, [[Ayub Khan (Afghan commander)|Ayub Khan]], one of Shir Ali's sons, marched upon that city from [[Herat]], defeated Abdur Rahman's troops, and occupied the place in July. This serious reverse roused the ''amir'', who had not at first displayed much activity. He led a force from Kabul, met Ayub's army close to Kandahar, and the complete victory which he there won forced Ayub Khan to fly into Persia. From that time Abdur Rahman was fairly seated on the throne at Kabul, and in the course of the next few years he consolidated his dominion over all Afghanistan, suppressing [[insurrection]]s by a sharp and relentless use of his [[despot]]ic authority. The powerful [[Ghilzai]] tribe revolted against the severity of his measures, but they were crushed by the end of [[1887]]. In that same year, Ayub Khan made a fruitless inroad from Persia. In [[1888]], the ''amir'' 's cousin, [[Ishak Khan]], rebelled against him in the north; but these two enterprises came to nothing. 

In [[1885]], at the moment when the ''amir'' was in conference with the British [[viceroy]], [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], in [[India]], the news came of a skirmish between Russian and Afghan troops at [[Panjdeh]], over a disputed point in the demarcation of the northwestern frontier of Afghanistan. Abdur Rahman's attitude at this critical juncture is a good example of his political sagacity. To one who had been a man of war from his youth, who had won and lost many fights, the rout of a detachment and the forcible seizure of some debatable frontier lands was an untoward incident; but it was not a sufficient reason for calling upon the British, although they had guaranteed his territory's integrity, to vindicate his rights by hostilities which would certainly bring upon him a Russian invasion from the north, and would compel his British allies to throw an army into Afghanistan from the southeast. His interest lay in keeping powerful neighbours, whether friends or foes, outside his kingdom. He knew this to be the only policy that would be supported by the Afghan nation; and although for some time a rupture with Russia seemed imminent, while the Indian government made ready for that contingency, the ''amir'' 's reserved and circumspect tone in the consultations with him helped to turn the balance between peace and war, and substantially conduced towards a pacific solution. Abdur Rahman left on those who met him in India the impression of a clear-headed man of action, with great self-reliance and hardihood, not without indications of the implacable severity that too often marked his administration. His investment with the insignia of the highest grade of the [[Order of the Star of India]] appeared to give him much pleasure. 

From the end of 1888, the ''amir'' spent eighteen months in his northern provinces bordering upon the Oxus, where he was engaged in pacifying the country that had been disturbed by revolts, and in punishing with a heavy hand all who were known or suspected to have taken any part in rebellion. Shortly afterwards (in [[1892]]) he succeeded in finally beating down the resistance of the [[Hazara]] tribe, who vainly attempted to defend their immemorial independence, within their highlands, of the central authority at Kabul. 

In [[1893]] Sir [[Mortimer Durand]] was deputed to Kabul by the government of India for the purpose of settling an exchange of territory required by the demarcation of the boundary between northeastern Afghanistan and the Russian possessions, and in order to discuss with the ''amir'' other pending questions. The ''amir'' showed his usual ability in diplomatic argument, his tenacity where his own views or claims were in debate, with a sure underlying insight into the real situation. The territorial exchanges were amicably agreed upon; the relations between the Indian and Afghan governments, as previously arranged, were confirmed; and an understanding was reached upon the important and difficult subject of the border line of Afghanistan on the east, towards India.  In [[1895]] the ''amir'' found himself unable, by reason of ill-health, to accept an invitation from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] to visit England; hut his second son [[Nasrullah Khan]] went in his stead. 

Abdur Rahman died on [[October 1]], [[1901]], being succeeded by his son [[Habibullah Khan|Habibullah]]. He had defeated all enterprises by rivals against his throne; he had broken down the power of local chiefs, and tamed the refractory tribes; so that his orders were irresistible throughout the whole dominion. His government was a military despotism resting upon a well-appointed army; it was administered through officials absolutely subservient to an inflexible will and controlled by a widespread system of [[espionage]]; while the exercise of his personal authority was too often stained by acts of unnecessary cruelty. He held open courts for the receipt of petitioners and the dispensation of justice; and in the disposal of business he was indefatigable.  He succeeded in imposing an organized government upon the fiercest and most unruly population in [[Asia]]; he availed himself of [[European]] inventions for strengthening his armament, while he sternly set his face against all innovations which, like [[railway]]s and [[Telegraphy|telegraph]]s, might give Europeans a foothold within his country. His adventurous life, his forcible character, the position of his state as a barrier between the Indian and the Russian empires, and the skill with which he held the balance in dealing with them, combined to make him a prominent figure in contemporary Asian politics and will mark his reign as an epoch in the history of Afghanistan. 

The ''amir'' received an annual subsidy from the British government of 18-1/2 ''[[lakh]]s'' of ''[[rupee]]s''.  He was allowed to import munitions of war. In [[1896]] he adopted the title of ''Tia-ul-hlillat-ud Din'' (&quot;Light of the nation and religion&quot;); and his zeal for the cause of [[Islam]] induced him to publish treatises on ''[[jihad]]''. His two eldest sons, [[Habibullah Khan]] and [[Nasrullah Khan]], were born at Samarkand. His youngest son, [[Mahomed Omar Jan]], was born in [[1889]] of an Afghan mother, connected by descent with the Barakzai family.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abencerrages''', was a family or faction that is said to have held a prominent position in the [[Moorish]] kingdom of [[Granada]] in the [[15th century]].

The name appears to have been derived from the Yussuf ben-Serragh, the head of the tribe in the time of [[Mahommed VII]], who did that sovereign good service in his struggles to retain the crown of which he was three times deprived.

Nothing is known of the family with certainty; but the name is familiar from the interesting romance of [[Gines Perez de Hita|Ginés Perez de Hita]], ''Guerras civiles de Granada'', which celebrates the feuds of the Abencerrages and the rival family of the Zegris, and the cruel treatment to which the former were subjected. J. P. de Florian's ''Gonsalve de Cordoue'' and Chàteaubriand's ''Le dernier des Abencerrages'' are imitations of Perez de Hita's work.

The story is told that one of the Abencerrages, having fallen in love with a lady of the royal family, was caught in the act of climbing up to her window. The king, enraged, shut up the whole family in one of the halls of the Alhambra, and ordered the Zergis to kill them all. The apartment where this is to have taken place is one of the most beautiful courts of the [[Alhambra]], and is still called the Hall of the Abencerrages. 

Many poems and plays, and one opera (''[[Les Abencerrages]]'', by [[Cherubini]]) mention the legend, but the whole story is doubtful, because the best historians do not mention it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Locator Map Abeokuta-Nigeria.png|thumb|250px|Location of Abeokuta in Nigeria]]
'''Abeokuta''' is a city of southwest [[Nigeria]], situated at {{coor dm|7|8|N|3|25|E|type:city}}, on the [[Ogun river]], 64 miles north of [[Lagos]] by railway, or 81 miles by water. As of 2002, the Abeokuta proper had an estimated population of about 230,000, while the figure for the city and outlying environs was approximately 500,000 individuals.

The city lies below the sacred [[Olumo]] rock, home to [[cave]]s and [[shrine]]s.  [[Fela Kuti]] and [[Wole Soyinka]] were both born in the town.

==History==

{{1911}}

A town of [[British West Africa]] in the Egba division of the Yoruba country, S. Nigeria Protectorate. [[Population]], approximately 60,000.  

Abeokuta lies in a beautiful and fertile country, the surface of which is broken by masses of grey granite.  It is spread over an extensive area, being surrounded by mud walls 18 miles in extent.  Abeokuta, under the reforming zeal of its native rulers, was largely transformed during the early years of the [[20th century]].  Law courts, government offices, prisons and a substantial bridge were built, good roads made, and a large staff of sanitary inspectors appointed.  The streets are generally narrow and the houses built of mud.  There are numerous markets in which a considerable trade is done in native products and articles of European manufacture.  Palm-oil, timber, [[rubber]], [[yam (vegetable)|yams]] and shea-butter are the chief articles of trade.  An official newspaper is published in the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[English language]]s.  Abeokuta is the headquarters of the Yoruba branch of the Church Missionary Society and [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]], missionaries have met with some success in their proselytizing work.  In their schools about [[2000]] children are educated.  The completion in [[1899]] of a railway from Lagos helped not only to develop trade but to strengthen generally the influence of the British. 

Abeokuta (a word meaning ''under the rocks,''), dating from [[1825]], owes its origin to the incessant inroads of the slavehunters from Dahomey and Ibadan, which compelled the village populations scattered over the open country to take refuge in this rocky stronghold against the common enemy.  Here they constituted themselves a free confederacy of many distinct groups, each preserving the traditional customs, religious rites and even the very names of their original villages.  Yet this apparently incoherent aggregate held its ground successfully against the powerful armies often sent against the place both by the king of Dahomey from the west, and by the people of Ibadan from the north-east. 

The district of Egba, of which Abeokuta is the capital, has an estimated area of 3000 sq. m. and a population of some 350,000.  It is officially known as the Abeokuta province of the [[Southern Nigeria]] protectorate.  It contains luxuriant forests of palmtrees, which constitute the chief wealth of the people.  Cotton is indigenous and is grown for export.  The Egbas are enthusiastic farmers and have largely adopted European methods of cultivation.  They are very tenacious of their independence, but accepted without opposition the establishment of a British protectorate, which, while putting a stop to inter-Yoruba warfare and slave-raiding, and exercising control over the working of the laws, left to the people executive and fiscal autonomy.  The administration is in the hands of a council of chiefs which exercises legislative, executive and, to some extent, judicial functions.  The president of this council, or ruling chief ---chosen from among the members of the two recognized reigning families--is called the Alake, a word meaning ''Lord of Ake,'' Ake being the name of the principal quarter of Abeokuta, after the ancient capital of the Egbas.  The Alake exercises little authority apart from his council, the form of government being largely democratic.  Revenue is chiefly derived from tolls or import duties.  A visit of the Alake to [[England]] in [[1904]] evoked considerable public interest.  The chief was a man of great intelligence, eager to study western civilization, and an ardent agriculturist.

'''Aberavon''' (''Aberafan'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]) is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It elects one [[Member of Parliament|Member of Parliament (MP)]] by the [[first past the post]] system of election.

== Boundaries ==

The constituency is in [[south Wales]], situated on the right bank of the [[River Afan]], near its mouth in [[Swansea]] Bay. The original village of Aberavon or Aberafan is now a district of [[Port Talbot]] (so named to reflect the involvement of wealthy local landowner and MP [[Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot]] in improving Aberavon's harbour). The valley of the Afan as from about [[1840]] a place of much metallurgical activity, resulting in tinplate and engineering works (now mostly closed down).  

The town derives its name from the river Avon (corrupted from Afan), which also gave its name to a mediæval lordship.  On the Norman conquest of [[Glamorgan]], Caradoc, the eldest son of the defeated prince, [[Iestyn ab Gwrgant]], continued to hold this lordship, and for the defence of the passage of the river built a castle whose foundations now lie underneath the streets around St Mary's church.  His descendants (who from the 13th century onwards styled themselves De Avan or D'Avene) established, under line protection of the castle, a chartered town, which in [[1372]] received a further charter from Edward Le Despenser, into whose family the lordship had come on an exchange of lands.  In modern times these charters were not acted upon, the town being deemed a borough by prescription, but in [[1861]] it was incorporated under the Municipal Corporations Act. From [[1832]] it belonged to the Swansea parliamentary district of boroughs, uniting with [[Kenfig]], [[Loughor]], [[Neath]] and Swansea to return one member; later it acquired its own MP, the most famous to hold the constituency having been [[Ramsay MacDonald]].

Aberavon village hosted the [[National Eisteddfod]] in [[1932]] and [[1966]].

'''Aberdare''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Aberdâr'') is an industrial town in the county borough of [[Rhondda Cynon Taff]] in the [[traditional county]] of [[Glamorgan]], in south [[Wales]], situated (as the name implies) at the confluence of the Dar and Cynon rivers.  The population at the ([[1991]]) census was 31,619.  It is 4 miles S.W. of [[Merthyr Tydfil]] and 24 from [[Cardiff]]. From being, at the beginning of the [[19th century]], a mere village in an agricultural district, the place grew rapidly in population owing to the abundance of its coal and iron ore, and the population of the whole parish (which was only 1486 in [[1801]]) increased tenfold during the first half of the century.  It has since declined, owing to the loss of most of the heavy industry.

Ironworks were established at Llwydcoed and Abernant in [[1799]] and [[1800]] respectively, followed by others at Gadlys and Aberaman in [[1827]] and [[1847]].  These have not been worked since about [[1875]]. Prior to [[1836]], most of the coal worked in the parish was consumed locally, chiefly in the ironworks, but in that year the working of steam coal for export was begun, pits were sunk in rapid succession, and the coal trade, which after [[1875]] was the chief support of the town, soon reached huge dimensions.  There were also several brickworks and breweries.  During the latter half Of the [[19th century]], considerable public improvements were made to the town, which became, despite its neighbouring collieries, a pleasant place to live.  Its institutions included a post-graduate theological college (opened in connection with the Church of [[England]] in [[1892]], until [[1907]], when it was removed to [[Llandaff]]).

Aberdare, with the ecclesiastical parishes of St Fagan's (Trecynon) and Aberaman carved out of the ancient parish, had twelve Anglican churches, one [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church (built in [[1866]] in Monk Street near the site of a cell attached to [[Penrhys Abbey]]) and at one time had over fifty Nonconformist chapels.  The services in the majority of the chapels were in Welsh.  The urban district includes what were once the separate villages of [[Aberaman]], [[Abernant, Aberdare|Abernant]], [[Cwmaman]], [[Cwmbach]], [[Cwmdare]], [[Llwydcoed]], [[Penywaun]] and [[Trecynon]].  There are several [[cairn]]s and the remains of a circular [[Great Britain|British]] encampment on the mountain between Aberdare and Merthyr.  [[Hirwaun]] moor, 4 miles to the N.W. of Aberdare, was according to tradition the scene of a battle at which Rhys ap Tewdwr, prince of [[Dyfed]], was defeated by the ailied forces of the Norman [[Robert Fitzhamon]] and [[Iestyn ab Gwrgan]], the last prince of Glamorgan.

The Coliseum is Aberdare's main [[arts]] venue, containing a 600-seat [[auditorium]] and [[movie theater|cinema]]. It was built in [[1938]] using [[miner]]s' subscriptions.

The town is served by [[Aberdare railway station]], the terminus of the [[Merthyr Line|Merthyr Line - Aberdare branch]].

      <comment>/* Moving in the rain */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''aberration of light''' (also referred to as '''astronomical aberration''' or '''stellar aberration''') is an astronomical phenomenon which produces an [[apparent motion]] of celestial objects. It is caused by the twin facts that the [[speed of light]] is finite, and that an observer on [[Earth]] is moving in an inertial frame. It does not require Earth to carry an observer to some other position after some period of time—only that Earth have some instantaneous velocity. A change in the position of an observer causes [[parallax]], which must not be confused with the aberration of light.

Stellar aberration is ''independent'' of the distance of a celestial object from the observer. It should also be distinguished from [[light-time correction]], which is due to the displacement of a solar system object, like a [[planet]], through space during the time taken by its light to reach an observer on Earth. Light-time correction is independent of the motion of Earth. ''Planetary aberration'' (of solar system objects) is the combination of the aberration of light (due to Earth's velocity) and light-time correction (due to a planet's displacement). Both are determined at the instant when the object's light reaches Earth.

== Explanation ==

[[image:Aberration1.gif|frame|right|Diagram illustrating stellar aberration]]
Stellar aberration causes the apparent position of a star to be displaced, and occurs when the observer's motion has a component that is [[perpendicular]] to a line between the star and observer. In the diagram to the right, '''S''' represents the position of the star, and '''E''' the position of the observer on Earth. The true direction of the star relative to the observer is thus '''ES''', whose length represents the speed of light. However, Earth has a velocity in the direction represented by the line '''EE’''', whose length represents that velocity. The ''Law of Aberration'' states that the star will therefore appear to lie in the direction '''ES’''', instead of '''ES''', where '''SS’''' is parallel and equal in length to '''EE’'''. The star's apparent position is hence displaced from its true position by the angle '''SES’'''. 

===Moving in the rain===

Many find aberration to be counter-intuitive, and a simple thought experiment based on everyday experience can help in its understanding. Imagine you are standing in the rain. There is no wind, so the rain is falling vertically. To protect yourself from the rain you hold an umbrella directly above you.

Now imagine that you start to walk. Although the rain is still falling vertically (relative to a stationary observer), you find that you have to hold the umbrella slightly in front of you to keep off the rain. Because of your forward motion relative to the falling rain, the rain now appears to be falling not from directly above you, but from a point in the sky somewhat in front of you.

The deflection of the falling rain is greatly increased at higher speeds. When you drive a [[car]] at night through falling rain, the rain drops illuminated by your car's [[headlight]]s appear to fall from a position in the sky well in front of your car.

===Types of aberration===

There are a number of types of stellar aberration, caused by the differing components of the Earth's motion:

* '''Annual Aberration''' is due to the [[Orbital revolution|revolution]] of the Earth around the [[Sun]].
* '''Diurnal Aberration''' is due to the [[rotation]] of the Earth about its own axis.
* '''Secular Aberration''' is due to the motion of the Sun and solar system relative to other stars in the [[galaxy]].

Annual and diurnal aberration cause stars to appear to vary in position on a periodic basis, and their effect must be included when computing the apparent position of a star at any given time. Secular aberration can be regarded as constant for all practical purposes, and so is usually ignored.

===Annual aberration===

As the Earth revolves around the Sun, it is moving at a velocity of approximately 30 km/s. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. In the special case where the earth is moving perpendicularly to the direction of the star (i.e. if '''SEE’''' in the diagram is 90 degrees), the angle of displacement, '''SES’''', would therefore be (in [[radian]]s) the ratio of the two velocities, i.e. 1/10000 or about 20.5 [[arcsecond]]s.

This quantity is known as the ''constant of aberration'', and is conventionally represented by ''&amp;kappa;''. Its precise accepted value is 20&quot;.49552 (at [[J2000]]).

The plane of the Earth's orbit is known as the [[ecliptic]]. Annual aberration causes stars exactly on the ecliptic to appear to move back and forth along a straight line, varying by ''&amp;kappa;'' either side of their true position. A star that is precisely at one of the ecliptic poles will appear to move in a circle of radius ''&amp;kappa;'' about its true position, and stars at intermediate ecliptic latitudes will appear to move along a small [[ellipse]].

A special case of annual aberration is the nearly constant deflection of the Sun from its true position by ''&amp;kappa;'' towards the ''west'' (as viewed from Earth), opposite to the apparent motion of the Sun along the ecliptic. This constant deflection is often erroneously explained as the motion of the Earth during the 8.3 minutes that it takes light to travel from the Sun to Earth. The latter is a type of ''parallax'', and actually causes the apparent motion of the Sun along the ecliptic towards the ''east'' relative to the fixed stars. (8.316746 minutes divided by one sidereal year (365.25636 days) is 20&quot;.49265, very close to ''&amp;kappa;'', but of opposite sign, east vs. west.) Nor is this the Sun's light-time correction because the Sun is almost motionless, moving around the [[barycenter]] (center of mass) of the solar system by usually much less than 0&quot;.03 (as viewed from Earth) during 8.3 minutes.

Aberration can be resolved into an east-west and north-south component on the [[celestial sphere]]. The former is larger, but the latter, present because of the 23.4° tilt of the Earth's axis ([[obliquity of the ecliptic]]), was the first to be detected. This is because accurate clocks are needed to measure the East-West component, but only a good plumb line is needed for the north-south component.

===Diurnal aberration===

Diurnal aberration is caused by the velocity of the observer on the surface of the rotating Earth. It is therefore dependent not only on the time of the observation, but also the location of the observer. Its effect is much smaller than that of annual aberration, and is only 0&quot;.32 in the case of an observer at the equator, where the rotational velocity is greatest.

==Historical background==

The discovery of the aberration of light in [[1725]] by [[James Bradley]] was one of the most important in astronomy. It was totally unexpected, and it was only by extraordinary perseverance and perspicuity that Bradley was able to explain it in [[1727]]. Its origin is based on attempts made to discover whether the stars possessed appreciable [[parallax]]es. The [[Copernicus|Copernican]] theory of the [[solar system]] &amp;ndash; that the Earth revolved annually about the Sun &amp;ndash; had received confirmation by the observations of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] (who, however, never accepted [[Heliocentrism|heliocentrism]]), and the mathematical investigations of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].

===Search for stellar parallax===

As early as [[1573]], [[Thomas Digges]] had suggested that this theory should necessitate a parallactic shifting of the stars, and, consequently, if such stellar parallaxes existed, then the Copernican theory would receive additional confirmation. Many observers claimed to have determined such parallaxes, but Tycho Brahe and [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] concluded that they existed only in the minds of the observers, and were due to instrumental and personal errors. In [[1680]] [[Jean Picard]], in his ''Voyage d'[[Uraniborg|Uranibourg]],'' stated, as a result of ten [[year]]s' observations, that [[Polaris]], or the [[Pole Star]], exhibited variations in its position amounting to 40&quot; annually. Some astronomers endeavoured to explain this by parallax, but these attempts were futile, for the motion was at variance with that which parallax would produce.

[[John Flamsteed]], from measurements made in [[1689]] and succeeding years with his mural quadrant, similarly concluded that the declination of the Pole Star was 40&quot; less in July than in September. [[Robert Hooke]], in [[1674]], published his observations of &amp;gamma; [[Draco (constellation)|Draconis]], a star with of [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; which passes practically overhead at the latitude of [[London]], and whose observations are therefore free from the complex corrections due to astronomical [[refraction]], and concluded that this star was 23&quot; more northerly in July than in October.

===Bradley's observations===

When James Bradley and [[Samuel Molyneux]] entered this sphere of astronomical research in [[1725]], there consequently prevailed much uncertainty whether stellar parallaxes had been observed or not; and it was with the intention of definitely answering this question that these astronomers erected a large telescope at the house of the latter at [[Kew]]. They determined to reinvestigate the motion of &amp;gamma; Draconis; the telescope, constructed by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] (1675-1751), a celebrated instrument-maker, was affixed to a vertical chimney stack, in such manner as to permit a small oscillation of the eyepiece, the amount of which, i.e. the deviation from the vertical, was regulated and measured by the introduction of a screw and a [[plumb line|plumb-line]].

The instrument was set up in November 1725, and observations on &amp;gamma; Draconis were made on the [[December 3|3rd]], [[December 5|5th]], [[December 11|11th]], and [[December 12|12th of December]]. There was apparently no shifting of the star, which was therefore thought to be at its most southerly point. On [[December 17]], however, Bradley observed that the star was moving southwards, a motion further shown by observations on the [[December 20|20th]]. These results were unexpected and inexplicable by existing theories. However, an examination of the telescope showed that the observed anomalies were not due to instrumental errors.

The observations were continued, and the star was seen to continue its southerly course until March, when it took up a position some 20&quot; more southerly than its December position. After March it began to pass northwards, a motion quite apparent by the middle of April; in June it passed at the same distance from the [[zenith]] as it did in December; and in September it passed through its most northerly position, the extreme range from north to south, i.e. the angle between the March and September positions, being 40&quot;.

This motion is evidently not due to parallax, for, in this case, the maximum range should be between the June and December positions; neither was it due to observational errors. Bradley and Molyneux discussed several hypotheses in the hope of fixing the solution. One hypothesis was: while &amp;gamma; Draconis was stationary, the plumb-line, from which the angular measurements were made, varied; this would follow if the axis of the Earth varied.

===Aberration vs nutation===

The oscillation of the Earth's axis may arise in two distinct ways; distinguished as ''[[nutation]] of the axis'' and ''[[variation]] of latitude''. Nutation, the only form of oscillation imagined by Bradley, postulates that while the Earth's axis is fixed with respect to the Earth (i.e. the north and south poles occupy permanent geographical positions), yet the axis is not directed towards a fixed point in the heavens; variation of latitude, however, is associated with the shifting of the axis within the Earth, i.e. the geographical position of the north pole varies.

Nutation of the axis would determine a similar apparent motion for all stars: thus, all stars having the same polar distance as &amp;gamma; Draconis should exhibit the same apparent motion after or before this star by a constant interval. Many stars satisfy the condition of equality of polar distance with that of &amp;gamma;  Draconis, but few were bright enough to be observed in Molyneux's telescope.

One such star, however, with a [[right ascension]] nearly equal to that of &amp;gamma; Draconis, but in the opposite sense, was selected and kept under observation. This star was seen to possess an apparent motion similar to that which would be a consequence of the nutation of the Earth's axis; but since its declination varied only one half as much as in the case of &amp;gamma; Draconis, it was obvious that nutation did not supply the requisite solution. Whether the motion was due to an irregular distribution of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], thus involving abnormal variations in the refractive index, was also investigated; here, again, negative results were obtained.

Bradley had already perceived, in the case of the two stars previously scrutinized, that the apparent difference of declination from the maximum positions was nearly proportional to the Sun's distance from the [[equinox|equinoctial]] points; and he realized the necessity for more observations before any generalization could be attempted. For this purpose he repaired to the Rectory, Wanstead, then the residence of Mrs. Pound, the widow of his uncle James Pound, with whom he had made many observations of the heavenly bodies.

Here he had set up, on [[August 19]], [[1727]], a more convenient telescope than that at Kew, its range extending over 6 1/4 degrees on each side of the zenith, thus covering a far larger area of the [[sky]]. Two hundred stars in the British Catalogue of Flamsteed traversed its field of view; and, of these, about fifty were kept under close observation. His conclusions may be thus summarized: 
#only stars near the [[solstice|solstitial]] colure had their maximum north and south positions when the Sun was near the equinoxes,
#each star was at its maximum position when it passed the zenith at six o'clock morning and evening (this he afterwards showed to be inaccurate, and found the greatest change in [[declination]] to be proportional to the latitude of the star),
#the apparent motions of all stars at about the same time was in the same direction.

===Development of the theory of aberration===

A re-examination of his previously considered hypotheses as to the cause of these phenomena was fruitless; the true theory was ultimately discovered by pure accident, comparable in simplicity and importance with the association of a falling apple with the discovery of the principle of universal gravitation. Sailing on the river [[Thames]], Bradley repeatedly observed the shifting of a vane on the mast as the boat altered its course and, having been assured that the motion of the vane meant that the boat, and not the wind, had altered its direction, he realized that the position taken up by the vane was determined by both the motion of the boat ''and'' the direction of the wind.

The application of this observation to the phenomenon which had so long perplexed him was not difficult, and, in 1727, he published his theory of the aberration of light &amp;mdash;a corner-stone of the edifice of astronomical science. Let S (fig. 2) be a star and the observer be carried along the line AB; let SB be perpendicular to AB. If the observer be stationary at B, the star will appear in the direction BS; if, however, he traverses the distance BA in the same time as light passes from the star to his eye, the star will appear in the direction AS. Since, however, the observer is not conscious of his own translatory motion with the Earth in its orbit, the star appears to have a displacement which is at all times parallel to the motion of the observer.

'''Aberration in optical systems''' ([[Lens (optics)|lenses]], [[Prism (optics)|prisms]], [[mirror]]s or series of them intended to produce a sharp image) generally leads to blurring of the image. It occurs when light from one point of an object after transmission through the system arrives in different points. Instrument-makers need to correct optical systems to compensate for aberration. The articles [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]] and [[caustic]] discuss the general features of reflected and refracted rays. 

Aberrations fall into two classes: 
*''[[chromatic aberration]]s'' (Gr. ''croma'', colour), where a system disperses the various [[wavelength]]s of (e.g.) white light
**See also [[chromatic aberration]]
*''[[monochromatic]] aberrations'' (Gr. ''monos'', one) produced without dispersion.  These include the aberrations at reflecting surfaces of any coloured light, and at refracting surfaces of monochromatic light of single wavelength. These include the following.
**[[Defocus aberration|Defocus]]
**[[Tilt aberration|Tilt]]
**[[Spherical aberration|Spherical]]
**[[Coma (optics)|Coma]]
**[[Astigmatism]]
**[[Petzval field curvature]]
**[[Distortion]]
***[[Barrel distortion]]
***[[Pincushion distortion]]
**[[Piston aberration|Piston]]

==Monochromatic aberration==

The elementary theory of optical systems leads to the theorem: Rays of light proceeding from any ''object point'' unite in an ''image point''; and therefore an ''object space'' is reproduced in an ''image space.'' The introduction of simple auxiliary terms, due to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|C. F. Gauss]] (''Dioptrische Untersuchungen'', Göttingen, [[1841]]), named the [[focal length]]s and [[focal plane]]s, permits the determination of the image of any object for any system (see [[Lens (optics)|lens]]). The Gaussian theory, however, is only true so long as the angles made by all rays with the optical axis (the symmetrical axis of the system) are infinitely small, i.e. with infinitesimal objects, images and lenses; in practice these conditions are not realized, and the images projected by uncorrected systems are, in general, ill defined and often completely blurred, if the aperture or field of view exceeds certain limits.

The investigations of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (''Phil.Mag.,'' [[1856]]; ''Quart. Journ. Math.,'' [[1858]], and [[Ernst Abbe]]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) showed that the properties of these reproductions, i.e. the relative position and magnitude of the images, are not special properties of optical systems, but necessary consequences of the supposition (in Abbe) of the reproduction of all points of a space in image points (Maxwell assumes a less general hypothesis), and are independent of the manner in which the reproduction is effected.  These authors proved, however, that no optical system can justify these suppositions, since they are contradictory to the fundamental laws of reflexion and refraction.  Consequently the Gaussian theory only supplies a convenient method of approximating to reality; and no constructor would attempt to realize this unattainable ideal.  All that at present can be attempted is, to reproduce a single plane in another plane; but even this has not been altogether satisfactorily accomplished, aberrations always occur, and it is improbable that these will ever be entirely corrected. 

This, and related general questions, have been treated -- besides the above-mentioned authors -- by M. Thiesen (''Berlin. Akad. Sitzber.,'' 1890, xxxv. 799; ''Berlin. Phys. Ges. Verh.,'' 1892) and H. Bruns (''Leipzig. Math.  Phys. Ber.,'' 1895, xxi. 325) by means of Sir W. R. Hamilton's ''characteristic function'' (Irish Acad. Trans., ''Theory of Systems of Rays'', 1828, et seq.).  Reference may also be made to the treatise of Czapski-Eppenstein, pp. 155-161. 

A review of the simplest cases of aberration will now be given.

===Aberration of axial points (spherical aberration in the restricted sense)===
[[Image:ABERR1.png|right|]]

If S (fig.5) be any optical system, rays proceeding from an axis point O under an angle u1 will unite in the axis point O'1; and those under an angle u2 in the axis point O'2.  If there be refraction at a collective spherical surface, or through a thin positive lens, O'2 will lie in front of O'1 so long as the angle u2 is greater than u1 (''under correction''); and conversely with a dispersive surface or lenses (''over correction'').  The caustic, in the first case, resembles the sign &gt; (greater than); in the second &lt; (less than).  If the angle u1 be very small, O'1 is the Gaussian image; and O'1 O'2 is termed the ''longitudinal aberration,'' and O'1R the ''lateral aberration'' of the pencils with aperture u2. If the pencil with the angle u2 be that of the maximum aberration of all the pencils transmitted, then in a plane perpendicular to the axis at O'1 there is a circular ''disk of confusion'' of radius O'1R, and in a parallel plane at O'2 another one of radius O'2R2; between these two is situated the ''disk of least confusion.'' 

The largest opening of the pencils, which take part in the reproduction of O, i.e. the angle u, is generally determined by the margin of one of the lenses or by a hole in a thin plate placed between, before, or behind the lenses of the system.  This hole is termed the ''stop'' or ''diaphragm''; Abbe used the term ''[[aperture]] stop'' for both the hole and the limiting margin of the lens.  The component S1 of the system, situated between the aperture stop and the object O, projects an image of the diaphragm, termed by Abbe the ''entrance pupil''; the ''exit pupil'' is the image formed by the component S2, which is placed behind the aperture stop.  All rays which issue from O and pass through the aperture stop also pass through the entrance and exit pupils, since these are images of the aperture stop.  Since the maximum aperture of the pencils issuing from O is the angle u subtended by the entrance pupil at this point, the magnitude of the aberration will be determined by the position and diameter of the entrance pupil.  If the system be entirely behind the aperture stop, then this is itself the entrance pupil (''front stop''); if entirely in front, it is the exit pupil (''back stop''). 

If the object point be infinitely distant, all rays received by the first member of the system are parallel, and their intersections, after traversing the system, vary according to their ''perpendicular height of incidence,'' i.e. their distance from the axis.  This distance replaces the angle u in the preceding considerations; and the aperture, i.e. the radius of the entrance pupil, is its maximum value.

===Aberration of elements, i.e. smallest objects at right angles to the axis===

If rays issuing from O (fig. 5) be concurrent, it does not follow that points in a portion of a plane perpendicular at O to the axis will be also concurrent, even if the part of the plane be very small.  With a considerable aperture, the neighbouring point N will be reproduced, but attended by aberrations comparable in magnitude to ON. These aberrations are avoided if, according to Abbe, the ''sine condition,'' sin u'1/sin u1=sin u'2/sin u2, holds for all rays reproducing the point O. If the object point O is infinitely distant, u1 and u2 are to be replaced by pi and h2, the perpendicular heights of incidence; the ''sine condition'' then becomes sin u'1/h1 sin u'2/h2. A system fulfilling this condition and free from spherical aberration is called ''aplanatic'' (Greek a-, privative, plann, a wandering).  This word was first used by [[Robert Blair]] (d. 1828), professor of practical astronomy at Edinburgh University, to characterize a superior achromatism, and, subsequently, by many writers to denote freedom from spherical aberration.  Both the aberration of axis points, and the deviation from the sine condition, rapidly increase in most (uncorrected) systems with the aperture.

===Aberration of lateral object points (points beyond the axis) with narrow pencils. Astigmatism.===

[[Image:ABERR2.png|right|]]

A point O (fig. 6) at a finite distance from the, axis (or with an infinitely distant object, a point which subtends a finite angle at the system) is, in general, even then not sharply reproduced, if the pencil of rays issuing from it and traversing the system is made infinitely narrow by reducing the aperture stop; such a pencil consists of the rays which can pass from the object point through the now infinitely small entrance pupil.  It is seen (ignoring exceptional cases) that the pencil does not meet he refracting or reflecting surface at right angles; therefore it is astigmatic (Gr. a-, privative, stigmia, a point).  Naming the central ray passing through the entrance pupil the ''axis of the pencil'' or ''principal ray,'' it can be said: the rays of the pencil intersect, not in one point, but in two focal lines, which can be assumed to be at right angles to the principal ray; of these, one lies in the plane containing the principal ray and the axis of the system, i.e. in the ''first principal section'' or ''meridional section'', and the other at right angles to it, i.e. in the second principal section or sagittal section.  We receive, therefore, in no single intercepting plane behind the system, as, for example, a focussing screen, an image of the object point; on the other hand, in each of two planes lines O' and O&quot; are separately formed (in neighbouring planes ellipses are formed), and in a plane between O' and O&quot; a circle of least confusion.  The interval O'O&quot;, termed the astigmatic difference, increases, in general, with the angle W made by the principal ray OP with the axis of the system, i.e. with the field of view.  Two ''astigmatic image surfaces'' correspond to one object plane; and these are in contact at the axis point; on the one lie the focal lines of the first kind, on the other those of the second.  Systems in which the two astigmatic surfaces coincide are termed anastigmatic or stigmatic. 

[[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] was probably the discoverer of astigmation; the position of the astigmatic image lines was determined by Thomas Young (''A Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy,'' 1807); and the theory was developed by A. Gullstrand (''Skand. Arch. f. Physiol.,'' 1890, 2, p. 269; ''Allgemeine Theorie der monochromat. Aberrationen,'' etc., Upsala, 1900; ''Arch. f.  Ophth.,'' 1901, 53, pp. 2, 185).  A bibliography by P. Culmann is given in M. von Rohr's ''Die Bilderzeugung in optischen Instrumenten'' (Berlin, 1904).

===Aberration of lateral object points with broad pencils.  Coma.===

By opening the stop wider, similar deviations arise for lateral points as have been already discussed for axial points; but in this case they are much more complicated.  The course of the rays in the meridional section is no longer symmetrical to the principal ray of the pencil; and on an intercepting plane there appears, instead of a luminous point, a patch of light, not symmetrical about a point, and often exhibiting a resemblance to a comet having its tail directed towards or away from the axis.  From this appearance it takes its name.  The unsymmetrical form of the meridional pencil--formerly the only one considered--is [[coma (optics)|coma]] in the narrower sense only; other errors of coma have been treated by A. Konig and M. von Rohr (op. cit.), and later by A. Gullstrand (op. cit.; ''Ann. d.  Phys.,'' 1905, 18, p. 941).

===Curvature of the field of the image===

If the above errors be eliminated, the two astigmatic surfaces united, and a sharp image obtained with a wide aperture--there remains the necessity to correct the curvature of the image surface, especially when the image is to be received upon a plane surface, e.g. in photography.  In most cases the surface is concave towards the system. 

===Distortion of the image===

[[Image:ABERR3rev.png|left|]]

If now the image be sufficiently sharp, inasmuch as the rays proceeding from every object point meet in an image point of satisfactory exactitude, it may happen that the image is distorted, i.e. not sufficiently like the object.  This error consists in the different parts of the object being reproduced with different magnifications; for instance, the inner parts may differ in greater magnification than the outer (''barrel-shaped distortion''), or conversely (''cushion-shaped distortion'') (see fig. 7). In [[computer graphics]] and [[post-production]] this effect is called lens distortion, and there are [http://www.vassg.hu/pdf/vass_gg_2003_lo.pdf algorithms] to correct it. Systems free of this aberration are called ''orthoscopic'' (orthos, right, skopein to look).  This aberration is quite distinct from that of the sharpness of reproduction; in unsharp, reproduction, the question of distortion arises if only parts of the object can be recognized in the figure.  If, in an unsharp image, a patch of light corresponds to an object point, the ''centre of gravity'' of the patch may be regarded as the image point, this being the point where the plane receiving the image, e.g. a focussing screen, intersects the ray passing through the middle of the stop.  This assumption is justified if a poor image on the focussing screen remains stationary when the aperture is diminished; in practice, this generally occurs.  This ray, named by Abbe a ''principal ray'' (not to be confused with the ''principal rays'' of the Gaussian theory), passes through the centre of the entrance pupil before the first refraction, and the centre of the exit pupil after the last refraction.  From this it follows that correctness of drawing depends solely upon the principal rays; and is independent of the sharpness or curvature of the image field.  Referring to fig. 8, we have O'Q'/OQ = a' tan w'/a tan w = 1/N, where N is the ''scale'' or magnification of the image.  For N to be constant for all values of w, a' tan w'/a tan w must also be constant.  If the ratio a'/a be sufficiently constant, as is often the case, the above relation reduces to the ''condition of [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]],'' i.e. tan w'/ tan w= a constant.  This simple relation (see Camb.  Phil.  Trans., 1830, 3, p. 1) is fulfilled in all systems which are symmetrical with respect to their diaphragm (briefly named ''symmetrical or holosymmetrical objectives''), or which consist of two like, but different-sized, components, placed from the diaphragm in the ratio of their size, and presenting the same curvature to it (hemisymmetrical objectives); in these systems tan w' / tan w = 1. 

[[Image:ABERR4rev.png|right|]]

The constancy of a'/a necessary for this relation to hold was pointed out by R. H. Bow (Brit.  Journ.  Photog., 1861), and Thomas Sutton (Photographic Notes, 1862); it has been treated by O. Lummer and by M. von Rohr (Zeit. f.  Instrumentenk., 1897, 17, and 1898, 18, p. 4). It requires the middle of the aperture stop to be reproduced in the centres of the entrance and exit pupils without spherical aberration.  M. von Rohr showed that for systems fulfilling neither the Airy nor the Bow-Sutton condition, the ratio a' tan w'/a tan w will be constant for one distance of the object.  This combined condition is exactly fulfilled by holosymmetrical objectives reproducing with the scale 1, and by hemisymmetrical, if the scale of reproduction be equal to the ratio of the sizes of the two components.

==Analytic treatment of aberrations==

The preceding review of the several errors of reproduction belongs to the ''[[Ernst Abbe|Abbe]] theory of aberrations,'' in which definite aberrations are discussed separately; it is well suited to practical needs, for in the construction of an optical instrument certain errors are sought to be eliminated, the selection of which is justified by experience.  In the mathematical sense, however, this selection is arbitrary; the reproduction of a finite object with a finite aperture entails, in all probability, an infinite number of aberrations.  This number is only finite if the object and aperture are assumed to be ''infinitely small of a certain order''; and with each order of infinite smallness, i.e. with each degree of approximation to reality (to finite objects and apertures), a certain number of aberrations is associated.  This connection is only supplied by theories which treat aberrations generally and analytically by means of indefinite series. 

[[Image:ABERR5rev.png|right|]]

A ray proceeding from an object point O (fig. 9) can be defined by the coordinates (&amp;xi;, &amp;eta;).  Of this point O in an object plane I, at right angles to the axis, and two other coordinates (x, y), the point in which the ray intersects the entrance pupil, i.e. the plane II. Similarly the corresponding image ray may be defined by the points (&amp;xi;', &amp;eta;'), and (x', y'), in the planes I' and II'. The origins of these four plane coordinate systems may be collinear with the axis of the optical system; and the corresponding axes may be parallel.  Each of the four coordinates &amp;xi;', &amp;eta;', x', y' are functions of &amp;xi;, &amp;eta;, x, y; and if it be assumed that the field of view and the aperture be infinitely small, then &amp;xi;, &amp;eta;, x, y are of the same order of infinitesimals; consequently by expanding &amp;xi;', &amp;eta;', x', y' in ascending powers of &amp;xi;, &amp;eta;, x, y, series are obtained in which it is only necessary to consider the lowest powers.  It is readily seen that if the optical system be symmetrical, the orqins of the coordinate systems collinear with the optical axis and the corresponding axes parallel, then by changing the signs of &amp;xi;, &amp;eta;, x, y, the values &amp;xi;', &amp;eta;', x', y' must likewise change their sign, but retain their arithmetical values; this means that the series are restricted to odd powers of the unmarked variables. 

The nature of the reproduction consists in the rays proceeding from a point O being united in another point O'; in general, this will not be the case, for &amp;xi;', &amp;eta;' vary if &amp;xi;, &amp;eta; be constant, but x, y variable.  It may be assumed that the planes I' and II' are drawn where the images of the planes I and II are formed by rays near the axis by the ordinary Gaussian rules; and by an extension of these rules, not, however, corresponding to reality, the Gauss image point O'&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, with coordinates &amp;xi;'&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;eta;'&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, of the point O at some distance from the axis could be constructed.  Writing D&amp;xi;'=&amp;xi;'-&amp;xi;'&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and D&amp;eta;'=&amp;eta;'-&amp;eta;'&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then D&amp;xi;' and D&amp;eta;' are the aberrations belonging to &amp;xi;, &amp;eta; and x, y, and are functions of these magnitudes which, when expanded in series, contain only odd powers, for the same reasons as given above.  On account of the aberrations of all rays which pass through O, a patch of light, depending in size on the lowest powers of &amp;xi;, &amp;eta;, x, y which the aberrations contain, will be formed in the plane I'. These degrees, named by ([[Jozef Maximilián Petzval|J. Petzval]] (''Bericht uber die Ergebnisse einiger dioptrischer Untersuchungen'', Buda Pesth, 1843; ''Akad. Sitzber., Wien,'' 1857, vols. xxiv. xxvi.) ''the numerical orders of the image,'' are consequently only odd powers; the condition for the formation of an image of the mth order is that in the series for D&amp;xi;' and D&amp;eta;' the coefficients of the powers of the 3rd, 5th . . . (m-2)th degrees must vanish.  The images of the Gauss theory being of the third order, the next problem is to obtain an image of 5th order, or to make the coefficients of the powers of 3rd degree zero.  This necessitates the satisfying of five equations; in other words, there are five alterations of the 3rd order, the vanishing of which produces an image of the 5th order. 

The expression for these coefficients in terms of the constants of the optical system, i.e. the radii, thicknesses, refractive indices and distances between the lenses, was solved by [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|L. Seidel]] (Astr. Nach., 1856, p. 289); in 1840, [[Jozef Maximilián Petzval|J. Petzval]] constructed his portrait objective,from similar calculations which have never been published (see M. von Rohr, ''Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs'', Berlin, 1899, p. 248).  The theory was elaborated by S. Finterswalder (Munchen. Acad.  Abhandl., 1891, 17, p. 519), who also published a posthumous paper of Seidel containing a short view of his work (''München. Akad. Sitzber.,'' 1898, 28, p. 395); a simpler form was given by A. Kerber (''Beiträge zur Dioptrik'', Leipzig, 1895-6-7-8-9).  A. Konig and M. von Rohr (see M. von Rohr, ''Die Bilderzeugung in optischen Instrumenten'', pp. 317-323) have represented Kerber's method, and have deduced the Seidel formulae from geometrical considerations based on the [[Ernst Abbe|Abbe]] method, and have interpreted the analytical results geometrically (pp. 212-316). 

The aberrations can also be expressed by means of the ''characteristic function'' of the system and its differential coefficients, instead of by the radii, &amp;c., of the lenses; these formulae are not immediately applicable, but give, however, the relation between the number of aberrations and the order.  Sir William Rowan Hamilton (British Assoc.  Report, 1833, p. 360) thus derived the aberrations of the third order; and in later times the method was pursued by Clerk Maxwell (''Proc. London Math. Soc.,'' 1874--1875; (see also the treatises of R. S. Heath and L. A. Herman), M. Thiesen (''Berlin. Akad.  Sitzber.,'' 1890, 35, p. 804), H. Bruns (''Leipzig. Math. Phys. Ber.,'' 1895, 21, p. 410), and particularly successfully by K. Schwartzschild (''Göttingen.  Akad.  Abhandl.,'' 1905, 4, No. 1), who thus discovered the aberrations of the 5th order (of which there are nine), and possibly the shortest proof of the practical (Seidel) formulae.  A. Gullstrand (vide supra, and ''Ann. d.  Phys.,'' 1905, 18, p. 941) founded his theory of aberrations on the differential geometry of surfaces. 

The aberrations of the third order are: (1) aberration of the axis point; (2) aberration of points whose distance from the axis is very small, less than of the third order -- the deviation from the sine condition and coma here fall together in one class; (3) astigmatism; (4) curvature of the field; (5) distortion. 

:'''(1)''' Aberration of the third order of axis points is dealt with in all text-books on optics.  It is very important in telescope design. In telescopes aperture is usually taken as the linear diameter of the objective.It is not the same as microscope aperture which is based on the entrance pupil or field of view as seen from the object and is expressed as an angular measurement. Higher order aberrations in telescope design can be mostly neglected.For microscopes it cannot be neglected. For a single lens of very small thickness and given power, the aberration depends upon the ratio of the radii r:r', and is a minimum (but never zero) for a certain value of this ratio; it varies inversely with the refractive index (the power of the lens remaining constant).  The total aberration of two or more very thin lenses in contact, being the sum of the individual aberrations, can be zero.  This is also possible if the lenses have the same algebraic sign.  Of thin positive lenses with n=1.5, four are necessary to correct spherical aberration of the third order.  These systems, however, are not of great practical importance.  In most cases, two thin lenses are combined, one of which has just so strong a positive aberration (''under-correction,'' vide supra) as the other a negative; the first must be a positive lens and the second a negative lens; the powers, however: may differ, so that the desired effect of the lens is maintained.  It is generally an advantage to secure a great refractive effect by several weaker than by one high-power lens.  By one, and likewise by several, and even by an infinite number of thin lenses in contact, no more than two axis points can be reproduced without aberration of the third order.  Freedom from aberration for two axis points, one of which is infinitely distant, is known as ''Herschel's condition.'' All these rules are valid, inasmuch as the thicknesses and distances of the lenses are not to be taken into account. 

:'''(2)''' The condition for freedom from coma in the third order is also of importance for telescope objectives; it is known as ''[[Joseph von Fraunhofer|Fraunhofer]]'s condition.'' (4) After eliminating the aberration On the axis, coma and astigmatism, the relation for the flatness of the field in the third order is expressed by the ''[[Jozef Maximilián Petzval|Petzval]] equation,'' S1/r(n'-n) = 0, where r is the radius of a refracting surface, n and n' the refractive indices of the neighbouring media, and S the sign of summation for all refracting surfaces.

==Practical elimination of aberrations==

As [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] already claimed in [[1858]], there is no optical system, which reproduces absolutely a finite 
plane on another with pencils of finite aperture. A strict and general proof was given [[1926]] by [[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory]].

But practical systems solve this problem with an accuracy which mostly suffices for the special purpose of each species of instrument.  The problem of finding a system which reproduces a given object upon a given plane with given magnification (in so far as aberrations must be taken into account) could be dealt with by means of the approximation theory; in most cases, however, the analytical difficulties were too great for older calculation methods but may be ameliorated by application of modern computer systems.  Solutions, however, have been obtained in special cases (see A. Konig in M. von Rohr's ''Die Bilderzeugung'', p. 373; K. Schwarzschild, Gottingen.  Akad. Abhandl., [[1905]], 4, Nos. 2 and 3). At the present time constructors almost always employ the inverse method: they compose a system from certain, often quite personal experiences, and test, by the trigonometrical calculation of the paths of several rays, whether the system gives the desired reproduction (examples are given in A. Gleichen, ''Lehrbuch der geometrischen Optik'', Leipzig and Berlin, [[1902]]).  The radii, thicknesses and distances are continually altered until the errors of the image become sufficiently small.  By this method only certain errors of reproduction are investigated, especially individual members, or all, of those named above.  The analytical approximation theory is often employed provisionally, since its accuracy does not generally suffice. 

In order to render spherical aberration and the deviation from the sine condition small throughout the whole aperture, there is given to a ray with a finite angle of aperture u* (width infinitely distant objects: with a finite height of incidence h*) the same distance of intersection, and the same sine ratio as to one neighbouring the axis (u* or h* may not be much smaller than the largest aperture U or H to be used in the system).  The rays with an angle of aperture smaller than u* would not have the same distance of intersection and the same sine ratio; these deviations are called ''zones,'' and the constructor endeavours to reduce these to a minimum.  The same holds for the errors depending upon the angle of the field of view, w: astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion are eliminated for a definite value, w*, ''zones of astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion,'' attend smaller values of w.  The practical optician names such systems: ''corrected for the angle of aperture u* (the height of incidence h*) or the angle of field of view w*.'' Spherical aberration and changes of the sine ratios are often represented graphically as functions of the aperture, in the same way as the deviations of two astigmatic image surfaces of the image plane of the axis point are represented as functions of the angles of the field of view. 

The final form of a practical system consequently rests on compromise; enlargement of the aperture results in a diminution of the available field of view, and vice versa. But the larger aperture will give the larger resolution . The following may be regarded as typical:

:(1) Largest aperture; necessary corrections are -- for the axis point, and sine condition; errors of the field of view are almost disregarded; example -- high-power microscope objectives. 

:(2) [[Wide angle lens|Largest field of view]]; necessary corrections are -- for astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion; errors of the aperture only slightly regarded; examples -- photographic widest angle objectives and oculars.  

:Between these extreme examples stands the ordinary photographic objective: the [[portrait objective]] is corrected more with regard to aperture; objectives for groups more with regard to the field of view. 

:(3) [[Telephoto lens|Telescope objectives]] have small fields of view and aberrations on axis
are very important.Therefore zones will be kept as small as possible and design should emphasize simplicity.Because of this these lenses are the best for analytical computation.

==Chromatic or colour aberration==

In optical systems composed of lenses, the position, magnitude and errors of the image depend upon the refractive indices of the glass employed (see [[Lens (optics)]], and above, ''Monochromatic Aberration'').  Since the index of refraction varies with the colour or wavelength of the light (see [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]), it follows that a system of lenses (uncorrected) projects images of different colours in somewhat different places and sizes and with different aberrations; i.e. there are ''chromatic differences'' of the distances of intersection, of magnifications, and of monochromatic aberrations.  If mixed light be employed (e.g. white light) all these images are formed; and since they are all ultimately intercepted by a plane (the retina of the eye, a focussing screen of a camera, etc.), they cause a confusion, named chromatic aberration; for instance, instead of a white margin on a dark background, there is perceived a coloured margin, or narrow spectrum.  The absence of this error is termed achromatism, and an optical system so corrected is termed achromatic.  A system is said to be ''chromatically under-corrected'' when it shows the same kind of chromatic error as a thin positive lens, otherwise it is said to be ''over-corrected.'' 

If, in the first place, monochromatic aberrations be neglected -- in other words, the Gaussian theory be accepted -- then every reproduction is determined by the positions of the focal planes, and the magnitude of the focal lengths, or if the focal lengths, as ordinarily happens, be equal, by three constants of reproduction.  These constants are determined by the data of the system (radii, thicknesses, distances, indices, &amp;c., of the lenses); therefore their dependence on the refractive index, and consequently on the colour, are calculable (the formulae are given in Czapski-Eppenstein, ''Grundzuge der Theorie der optischen Instrumente'' (1903, p. 166).  The refractive indices for different wavelengths must be known for each kind of glass made use of.  In this manner the conditions are maintained that any one constant of reproduction is equal for two different colours, i.e. this constant is achromatized.  For example, it is possible, with one thick lens in air, to achromatize the position of a focal plane of the magnitude of the focal length.  If all three constants of reproduction be achromatized, then the Gaussian image for all distances of objects is the same for the two colours, and the system is said to be in ''stable achromatism.'' 

In practice it is more advantageous (after Abbe) to determine the chromatic aberration (for instance, that of the distance of intersection) for a fixed position of the object, and express it by a sum in which each component conlins the amount due to each refracting surface (see Czapski-Eppenstein, op. cit. p. 170; A. Konig in M. v. Rohr's collection, ''Die Bilderzeugung'', p. 340).  In a plane containing the image point of one colour, another colour produces a disk of confusion; this is similar to the confusion caused by two ''zones'' in spherical aberration.  For infinitely distant objects the radius Of the chromatic disk of confusion is proportional to the linear aperture, and independent of the focal length (''vide supra'', ''Monochromatic Aberration of the Axis Point''); and since this disk becomes the less harmful with an increasing image of a given object, or with increasing focal length, it follows that the deterioration of the image is proportional to the ratio of the aperture to the focal length, i.e. the ''relative aperture.'' (This explains the gigantic focal lengths in vogue before the discovery of achromatism.) 

Examples:
:'''(a)''' In a very thin lens, in air, only one constant of reproduction is to be observed, since the focal length and the distance of the focal point are equal.  If the refractive index for one colour be n, and for another n+dn, and the powers, or reciprocals of the focal lengths, be f and f + df, then (1) df/f = dn/(n-1) = 1/n; dn is called the dispersion, and n the dispersive power of the glass. 

:'''(b)''' Two thin lenses in contact: let f1 and f2 be the powers corresponding to the lenses of refractive indices n1 and n2 and radii r'1, r&quot;1, and r'2, r&quot;2 respectively; let f denote the total power, and df, dn1, dn2 the changes of f, n1, and n2 with the colour.  Then the following relations hold: -- 

::(2) f = f1-f2== (n1 - 1)(1/r'1-1/r''1) +(n2-1)(1/r'2 - 1/r''2) = (n1 - 1)k1 + (n2 - 1)k2; and 

::(3) df = k1dn1 + k2dn2.  For achromatism df = 0, hence, from (3), 

::(4) k1/k2 = -dn2 / dn1, or f1/f2 = -n1/n2.  Therefore f1 and f2 must have different algebraic signs, or the system must be composed of a collective and a dispersive lens.  Consequently the powers of the two must be different (in order that f be not zero (equation 2)), and the dispersive powers must also be different (according to 4). 

Newton failed to perceive the existence of media of different dispersive powers required by achromatism; consequently he constructed large reflectors instead of refractors.  James Gregory and Leonhard Euler arrived at the correct view from a false conception of the achromatism of the eye; this was determined by Chester More Hall in 1728, Klingenstierna in 1754 and by Dollond in 1757, who constructed the celebrated achromatic telescopes. (See [[telescope]].) 

Glass with weaker dispersive power (greater v) is named ''[[Crown glass (optics)|crown glass]]''; that with greater dispersive power, ''[[flint glass]]''. For the construction of an achromatic collective lens (f positive) it follows, by means of equation (4), that a collective lens I. of crown glass and a dispersive lens II. of flint glass must be chosen; the latter, although the weaker, corrects the other chromatically by its greater dispersive power.  For an achromatic dispersive lens the converse must be adopted.  This is, at the present day, the ordinary type, e.g., of telescope objective (fig. 10); the values of the four radii must satisfy the equations (2) and (4). Two other conditions may also be postulated: one is always the elimination of the aberration on the axis; the second either the ''Herschel'' or ''Fraunhofer Condition,'' the latter being the best vide supra, ''Monochromatic Aberration'').  In practice, however, it is often more useful to avoid the second condition by making the lenses have contact, i.e. equal radii.  According to P. Rudolph (Eder's Jahrb. f.  Photog., 1891, 5, p. 225; 1893, 7, p. 221), cemented objectives of thin lenses permit the elimination of spherical aberration on the axis, if, as above, the collective lens has a smaller refractive index; on the other hand, they permit the elimination of astigmatism and curvature of the field, if the collective lens has a greater refractive index (this follows from the Petzval equation; see L. Seidel, Astr.  Nachr., 1856, p. 289).  Should the cemented system be positive, then the more powerful lens must be positive; and, according to (4), to the greater power belongs the weaker dispersive power (greater v), that is to say, clown glass; consequently the crown glass must have the greater refractive index for astigmatic and plane images.  In all earlidr kinds of glass, however, the dispersive power increased with the refractive index; that is, v decreased as n increased; but some of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott were crown glasses of high refractive index, and achromatic systems from such crown glasses, with flint glasses of lower refractive index, are called the ''new achromats,'' and were employed by P. Rudolph in the first ''anastigmats'' (photographic objectives). 

Instead of making df vanish, a certain value can be assigned to it which will produce, by the addition of the two lenses, any desired chromatic deviation, e.g. sufficient to eliminate one present in other parts of the system.  If the lenses I. and II. be cemented and have the same refractive index for one colour, then its effect for that one colour is that of a lens of one piece; by such decomposition of a lens it can be made chromatic or achromatic at will, without altering its spherical effect.  If its chromatic effect (df/f) be greater than that of the same lens, this being made of the more dispersive of the two glasses employed, it is termed ''hyper-chromatic.'' 

For two thin lenses separated by a distance D the condition for achromatism is D = v1f1+v2f2; if v1=v2 (e.g. if the lenses be made of the same glass), this reduces to D= 1/2 (f1+f2), known as the ''condition for oculars.'' 

If a constant of reproduction, for instance the focal length, be made equal for two colours, then it is not the same for other colours, if two different glasses are employed.  For example, the condition for achromatism (4) for two thin lenses in contact is fulfilled in only one part of the spectrum, since dn2/dn1 varies within the spectrum.  This fact was first ascertained by J. Fraunhofer, who defined the colours by means of the dark lines in the solar spectrum; and showed that the ratio of the dispersion of two glasses varied about 20% from the red to the violet (the variation for glass and water is about 50%).  If, therefore, for two colours, a and b, fa = fb = f, then for a third colour, c, the focal length is different; that is, if c lies between a and b, then fc&lt;f, and vice versa; these algebraic results follow from the fact that towards the red the dispersion of the positive crown glass preponderates, towards the violet that of the negative flint.  These chromatic errors of systems, which are achromatic for two colours, are called the ''secondary spectrum,'' and depend upon the aperture and focal length in the same manner as the primary chromatid errors do. 

In fig. 11, taken from M. von Rohr,s ''Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs'', the abscissae are focal lengths, and the ordinates wave-lengths; of the latter the Fraunhofer lines used are-- 

  A'       C      D   Green Hg.   F    G'    Violet Hg. 767.7  656.3  589.3   546.1    486.2 454.1  405.1 mm, 

[[Image:ABERR6rev.png|left|]]

and the focal lengths are made equal for the lines C and F. In the neighbourhood of 550 mm the tangent to the curve is parallel to the axis of wave-lengths; and the focal length varies least over a fairly large range of colour, therefore in this neighbourhood the colour union is at its best.  Moreover, this region of the spectrum is that which appears brightest to the human eye, and consequently this curve of the secondary on spectrum, obtained by making fc = fF, is, according to the experiments of Sir G. G. Stokes (Proc.  Roy. Soc., [[1878]]), the most suitable for visual instruments (''optical achromatism,'').  In a similar manner, for systems used in photography, the vertex of the colour curve must be placed in the position of the maximum sensibility of the plates; this is generally supposed to be at G'; and to accomplish this the F and violet mercury lines are united.  This artifice is specially adopted in objectives for astronomical photography (''pure actinic achromatism'').  For ordinary photography, however, there is this disadvantage: the image on the focussing-screen and the correct adjustment of the photographic sensitive plate are not in register; in astronomical photography this difference is constant, but in other kinds it depends on the distance of the objects.  On this account the lines D and G' are united for ordinary photographic objectives; the optical as well as the actinic image is chromatically inferior, but both lie in the same place; and consequently the best correction lies in F (this is known as the ''actinic correction'' or ''freedom from chemical focus''). 

Should there be in two lenses in contact the same focal lengths for three colours a, b, and c, i.e. fa = fb = fc = f, then the relative partial dispersion (nc-nb) (na-nb) must be equal for the two kinds of glass employed.  This follows by considering equation (4) for the two pairs of colours ac and bc. Until recently no glasses were known with a proportionap degree of absorption; but R. Blair (Trans. Edin. Soc., 1791, 3, p. 3), P. Barlow, and F. S. Archer overcame the difficulty by constructing fluid lenses between glass walls.  Fraunhofer prepared glasses which reduced the secondary spectrum; but permanent success was only assured on the introduction of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott.  In using glasses not having proportional dispersion, the deviation of a third colour can be eliminated by two lenses, if an interval be allowed between them; or by three lenses in contact, which may not all consist of the old glasses.  In uniting three colours an ''achromatism of a higher order'' is derived; there is yet a residual ''tertiary spectrum,'' but it can always be neglected. 

The Gaussian theory is only an approximation; monochromatic or spherical aberrations still occur, which will be different for different colours; and should they be compensated for one colour, the image of another colour would prove disturbing.  The most important is the chromatic difference of aberration of the axis point, which is still present to disturb the image, after par-axial rays of different colours are united by an appropriate combination of glasses.  If a collective system be corrected for the axis point for a definite wave-length, then, on account of the greater dispersion in the negative components -- the flint glasses, -- over-correction will arise for the shorter wavelengths (this being the error of the negative components), and under-correction for the longer wave-lengths (the error of crown glass lenses preponderating in the red).  This error was treated by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and, in special detail, by C. F. Gauss.  It increases rapidly with the aperture, and is more important with medium apertures than the secondary spectrum of par-axial rays; consequently, spherical aberration must be elliminated for two colours, and if this be impossible, then it must be eliminated for those particular wave-lengths which are most effectual for the instrument in question (a graphical representation of this error is given in M. von Rohr, ''Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs''). 

The condition for the reproduction of a surface element in the place of a sharply reproduced point -- the constant of the sine relationship must also be fulfilled with large apertures for several colours.  E. Abbe succeeded in computing microscope objectives free from error of the axis point and satisfying the sine condition for several colours, which therefore, according to his definition, were ''aplanatic for several colours''; such systems he termed ''[[apochromatic]]''.  While, however, the magnification of the individual zones is the same, it is not the same for red as for blue; and there is a chromatic difference of magnification.  This is produced in the same amount, but in the opposite sense, by the oculars, which Abbe used with these objectives (''compensating oculars''), so that it is eliminated in the image of the whole microscope.  The best telescope objectives, and photographic objectives intended for three-colour work, are also apochromatic, even if they do not possess quite the same quality of correction as microscope objectives do.  The chromatic differences of other errors of reproduction have seldom practical importances. 

--&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The investigations of [[Ernst Abbe]] on geometrical optics, originally published only in his university lectures, were first compiled by S. Czapski in 1893.  See below, Authorities.

==Authorities.==

The classical treatise in English is H. D. Taylor, ''A System of Applied Optics'' (1906); reference may also be made to R. S. Heath, ''A Treatise on Geometrical Optics'' (2nd ed., 1895); and L A. Herman, ''A Treatise on Geometrical Optics'' (1900). The ideas of Abbe were first dealt with in S. Czapski, ''Theorie der optischen Instrumente nach Abbe'', published separately at Breslau in 1893, and as vol. ii. of Winkelmann's ''Handbuch der Physik'' in 1894; a second edition, by Czapski and O. Eppenstein, was published at Leipzig in 1903 with the title, ''Grundzuge der Theorie der optischen Instrumente nach Abbe'', and in vol. ii. of the 2nd ed. of Winkelmann's ''Handbuch der Physik''. The collection of the scientific staff of [[Carl Zeiss]] at [[Jena]], edited by M. von Rohr, ''Die bilderzeugung in optischen Instrumenten vom Standpunkte der geometrischen Optik'' (Berlin, 1904), contains articles by A. Konig and M. von Rohr specially dealing with aberrations. (O. E.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amy Lee Grant''' (born [[November 25]], [[1960]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[singer]]-[[songwriter]] whose [[music]] has strong [[Christianity|Christian]] themes.  She was initially most successful in the [[Contemporary Christian music]] genre, and is notable for being one of the first CCM artists to have successfully crossed over into the mainstream pop music market. She has won multiple [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] and [[Dove Award|Dove]] awards and was elected to the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] in [[2003]]. To date she has 5 [[gold album|gold]] and 6 [[platinum album|platinum]] albums.

==Career==
Signed to a record company at the age of sixteen, Grant's first, self-titled [[Amy Grant (album)|album]] (largely self-composed) in [[1977]], was a runaway success in terms of the Christian music market of the time. A graduate of [[Harpeth Hall School]] and then an [[English language|English]] major at [[Vanderbilt University]], Grant made a few more albums before dropping out of college to pursue a career in music. These albums included [[1979]]'s ''[[My Father's Eyes]]'' (the title track written by Grant's future first husband, singer-songwriter [[Gary Chapman]]) and ''[[Never Alone]]'' in [[1980]].

The year [[1982]] marked a turning point in both Grant's career and personal life. After marrying Chapman in June, her album ''[[Age to Age]]'' forced critics to sit up and take notice. The breakthrough album contained the now signature track, &quot;El Shaddai&quot; and the Grant-Chapman penned song, &quot;In A Little While.&quot; She was now a star. Grant received her first [[Grammy Award]] for Best Contemporary Gospel Performance, as well two [[Dove Awards]] for Gospel Artist of the Year and Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year.

Grant followed up this album with the first of her Christmas albums - albums that later would be the basis for her trademark holiday shows. [[1984]] saw the release of another pop-oriented Christian hit, ''[[Straight Ahead (Amy Grant album)|Straight Ahead]],'' earning Grant her first appearance at the Grammy Awards show.

Hardly had Grant established herself as the &quot;Queen of Christian Pop&quot;, however, when she changed directions to widen her fan base (and hence her musical message). Her goal was to become the first Christian singer-songwriter who was also successful as a contemporary pop singer, being successful in both genres.  [[1985]]'s ''[[Unguarded]]'' shocked some fans for its very mainstream sound (and Grant's leopard-print jacket, in four poses for four different covers). &quot;Find a Way,&quot; from ''Unguarded'', became the first Christian song to hit [[The Billboard Hot 100|Billboard's Top 40]] list, also reaching #7 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Amy Grant scored her first Billboard Number One hit in 1986 with &quot;The Next Time I Fall&quot;, a breezy duet with former [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] singer/bassist [[Peter Cetera]].

[[1988]]'s ''[[Lead Me On]]'', released after Grant had become a mother and undergone considerable strain in her [[marriage]], is considered her most mature album, both lyrically and musically. This album, too, contained many songs that were still about Christianity and love relationships, but some interpreted it as not being an obviously &quot;Christian&quot; record; though the album's title track is now considered a CCM classic. (Years later, ''Lead Me On'' would be chosen as the greatest Contemporary Christian album of all time by ''[[CCM Magazine]]''.)This song talks about intense sufferings among people through racism, and that the comfort they seek, as their lives are threatened, is in their relationships with God. The track &quot;1974&quot; is clearly about young people experiencing the salvation of Christ for the first time; as the lyrics state, &quot;Quite a change, somewhere we had crossed a big line, down upon our knees we had tasted Holy wine and nothing could sway us in a lifetime.&quot; The mainstream song, &quot;Saved by Love&quot;, was a minor hit, receiving airplay on radio stations featuring newly emerging [[Adult Contemporary]] format. It gives a message of great love for family, affected by her greatest love for Jesus. &quot;Faithless Heart&quot; is an honest, heartfelt song about resisting inner temptations of infidelity. &quot;What About The Love?&quot; talks about the absence of faith in certain worldly things and the importance of resisting judgment of others. Other songs included were engaging love songs, including &quot;If These Walls Could Speak&quot;, which, like &quot;Saved By Love&quot;, includes a message about love of family and children. This was a deeply introspective album that she dedicated to one of her children, so that they could understand her at that time in her life. The album's fiery title song received some Top 40 airplay (including on WCZY-FM in Detroit) and crossed over to #96 on the Billboard Hot 100, and &quot;1974 (We Were Young)&quot; and &quot;Saved By Love&quot; also charted AC.  
 
Nevertheless, when ''[[Heart in Motion]]'' was released three years later, many fans were shocked and outraged that the album was so clearly one of contemporary [[pop music]]. The track &quot;Baby Baby&quot; (written for Grant's newborn daughter, Millie, whose &quot;six week old face was my inspiration&quot;), however, became a massive hit (hitting number 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 pop chart), and Grant was established as a name in the mainstream music world. The music video also created outrage in the industry, for she danced and flirted with a model ([[Jme Stein]]), not her husband.  When interviewed about it, she thought the song was more relatable to others when shown in a romantic light.  &quot;Baby Baby&quot; received Grammy nominations for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Record and Song of the Year (although it failed to win in any of those categories). Four other hits from the album made the pop top 20: &quot;Every Heartbeat&quot; (#2), &quot;That's What Love Is For&quot; (#7), &quot;Good For Me&quot; (#8), and &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; (#20).  On the AC chart, all five songs were top 10 hits with two of the five (&quot;Baby Baby&quot; and &quot;That's What Love Is For&quot;) making it all the way to #1.  Many Christian fans remained loyal, though, as the album also topped the Billboard's Contemporary Christian Chart for 32 weeks. ''Heart in Motion'' is her best-selling album, having sold over 5 million copies. Tracks like &quot;Hope Set High&quot; and &quot;Ask Me&quot; (the tale of an abused child who, as a grown woman, comes to terms with her past through her faith in God) were songs with clear religious messages.  

[[image:amygrant2.jpg|thumb|Amy Grant]]
''[[House of Love (album)|House of Love]]'' in [[1994]] continued in the same vein, boasting catchy pop songs mingled with spiritual lyrics. The album was a multi-platinum success and produced the minor pop hit &quot;Lucky One&quot; (#18 pop and #2 AC) as well as the title track (a duet with country music star, and Grant's future second husband, [[Vince Gill]]) (#37 pop) and a cover of Joni Mitchell's frequently-covered &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; (#67 pop).  

In 1995, Amy was interviewed, pointing to [[Hootie &amp; The Blowfish]] and [[Sheryl Crow]], with their acoustic guitars and more rock-oriented music, and wondered what she was still doing on the pop side of things.  She knew she could bring her unique voice and songwriting skills to a different music genre.  

After covering the [[10cc]] song &quot;The Things We Do For Love&quot; for the Mr. Wrong soundtrack,[[1997]]'s ''[[Behind the Eyes]]'' was the answer to that question. BTE struck a much darker note, leaning more toward downtempo, acoustic soft-rock songs with more mature (yet still optimistic) lyrics (such as the radio hit &quot;Takes A Little Time&quot;).  She called it her &quot;razor blades and Prozac&quot; album.  Soon it became clear that Grant's marriage to Chapman was at an end. The two separated and [[divorce]]d in [[1999]], disappointing many Christian fans. In 2000 Grant married Vince Gill, who divorced country singer [[Janis Gill]] of [[Sweethearts of the Rodeo]]. 

After giving birth to fourth child Corinna Grant Gill, Grant returned to her [[gospel music]] roots with the [[2002]] release of ''[[Legacy... Hymns and Faith]]''. The album featured a Vince Gill-influenced mix of bluegrass and gospel and marked Grant's 25th anniversary in the music industry. Grant followed this up with the pop release ''[[Simple Things (Amy Grant album)|Simple Things]]'' in [[2003]]. The album did not see the success of her previous pop efforts, however. It was rumored that the pop album was held back for release after the hymns album, due to the controversy surrounding Grant's divorce from Chapman with Gill waiting in the wings. After their marriage, the two admitted having loved each other for a &quot;long time&quot;.  Grant argued that the timing of these album releases was changed because she and her second husband were expecting a child together.  On her website and in an interview on [[Lifetime Television]], she stated:  &quot;Then life happened.&quot;  Grant also stated that her record company threatened her with a lawsuit if she didn't finish Simple Things.  Not coincidentally, soon after [[Simple Things]], Amy and [[Interscope]]/A&amp;M parted ways.

Grant released a sequel to her [[hymns]] collection in 2005 titled ''[[Rock of Ages...Hymns and Faith|Rock of Ages]]''. Despite publicly musing that life would be easier if she weren't working, Grant joined the [[reality television]] phenomenon by hosting ''[[Three Wishes]]'', a show in which she and a team of helpers make wishes come true for small-town residents. The show debuted on [[NBC]] in the fall of 2005, but has since been cancelled.

After ''[[Three Wishes]]'' was cancelled, Grant won her 6th [[Grammy Award]] for [[Rock of Ages]], and announced the recording of a live CD/DVD in April 2006. 

In a February, 2006 webchat, Amy stated she believes her &quot;best music is still ahead.&quot;

Grant is a longstanding member of the [[Gospel Music Association]] (GMA), which annually presents the [[Dove Awards]] and maintains the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]].

'''Aberdeen''', a [[city]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Brown County, South Dakota|Brown County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States|USA]], about 125 mi (200 km) N.E. of [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]].  Settled in [[1880]], it was incorporated in [[1882]].  Pop. ([[1890]]) 3182; ([[1900]]) 4087, of whom 889 were foreign-born; ([[1905]]) 5841; ([[1910]]) 10,753.  As of the [[2000]] census, the city had a total population of 24,658.  

In [[1911]], Aberdeen was served by the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee and St Paul]], the [[Great Northern Railroad|Great Northern]], the [[Minneapolis and St. Louis Railroad|Minneapolis and St. Louis]], and the [[Chicago and North Western Railroad|Chicago and North Western]] railroads which contributed to Aberdeen's nickname, &quot;The Hub City&quot;.  It is the financial and trade center for the northern part of the state, a fine agricultural region, and in [[1908]] had five banks and a number of wholesale houses.  The city is the seat of [[Northern State University]], a state institution, founded in 1901, and has a [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegie Library]]; the principal buildings are the court house and the government buildings.  [[Artesian aquifer|Artesian well]]s furnish good water-power, and artesian-well supplies, grain pitchers, brooms, chemicals and flour are manufactured.  The municipality owns and operates the water-works.  Aberdeen was settled in [[1880]], and was chartered as a city in [[1883]].

==Education==
Aberdeen is home to several high schools, including: Aberdeen Central High School (Public), Aberdeen Christian High School, and Roncalli High school (Catholic).
[[Image:CHS.JPG|left|180px|The new Aberdeen Central High School.]]  

Aberdeen Central High School has an enrollment of 1,200 students, grades 9-12. The school was founded in 1911 near downtown Aberdeen, and served as the home of the Golden Eagles for nearly 90 years. In the fall of 2004, Aberdeen Central students were welcomed into a new $28 million facility in South East Aberdeen. The school has numerous improvements over the previous school featuring air conditioning, handicap accessibility, and a state of the art [http://www.daktronics.com/photo_detail.cfm?cc=CC04886/ gymnasium.]including a large [[Daktronics]] replay board.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aberdour''', a village in [[Fife]], [[Scotland]], lies on the shore of the [[Firth of Forth]], 17.5 miles north-west of [[Edinburgh]] by rail or road. It features excellent beaches and good examples of Fife architecture.

Aberdour Castle stands next to St.Fillan's church (12th century) which contains some fine [[Norman architecture | Norman]] work.  About 3 miles south-west of Aberdour stands [[Donibristle House]], the seat of the [[Earl of Moray]], and the scene of the murder ([[7 February]] [[1592]]) of one earl, remembered in the ballad ''[[The Bonny Earl of Murray]]''.



== Silver and Black Sands ==

Aberdour is home to two beaches, the most popular being the Silver Sands. The Silver Sands is one of Scotland's seven &quot;[[Blue Flag]]&quot; Awarded beaches - which denotes an exemplary standard of cleanliness. As the name suggests, the beach has soft, light coloured sand. The Black Sands, on the other side of the village, has a more rocky and dark surface - but is also popular with visitors exploring the rock caves and interesting sea life. The Silver Sands is very popular in summer time and adequate parking space is available in the large fields surrounding the beach.

== Inchcolm ==
The island of [[Inchcolm]], or Island of [[Columba]],  a quarter of a mile from the shore, forms part of the parish of Aberdour.  As its name implies, its associations date back to the time of Columba.  The primitive stone-roofed [[chapel | oratory]] presumably served as a [[hermit]]'s cell.  

King [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] founded the [[Augustinian]] [[monastery]] in [[1123]]. It has well-preserved buildings, consisting of a low square tower, church, [[cloister]]s, refectory and small [[chapter-house]].  

[[England|English]] and other rovers occasionally plundered the island of Columba, but in the [[16th century]] it became the property of Sir [[James Stewart]], whose grandson became third [[Earl of Moray]] by virtue of his marriage to the elder daughter of the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|first earl]].  From it comes the earl's title of [[Lord St Colme]] ([[1611]]).

'''Aberfoyle''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]: &lt;I&gt;Obar Phuill&lt;/I&gt;) is a [[village]] in the region of [[Stirling (district)|Stirling]], [[Scotland]], 27 miles [[northwest]] of [[Glasgow]]. The [[population]] stands at 635 as of the [[1998]] [[census]].  

The town is situated at the base of [[Craigmore]] (1271 [[foot (unit of length)|foot]] [[Height|high]]) and on the Laggan, a head-water of the [[River Forth]].  Since [[1885]], when the [[Duke of Montrose]] constructed a road over the eastern shoulder of Craigmore to join the older road at the entrance of the [[Trossachs]] pass, Aberfoyle has become the alternative route to the Trossachs and [[Loch Katrine]]; this road, known as the Duke's Road or Duke's Pass, was opened to the [[public]] in [[1931]] when the [[Forestry Commission]] acquired the land.  

[[Loch Ard]], about 2 [[mile]]s west of Aberfoyle, lies 105 feet above the [[sea level|sea]].  It is 3 miles long (including the narrows at the east end) and 1 mile broad.  Towards the west end is Eilean Gorm (''the green isle''), and near the north-western shore are the falls of Ledard.  Two miles northwest is Loch Chon, at 90 feet above the sea, 1.25 miles long, and about half a mile broad.  It [[Drainage|drains]] by the Avon Dhu to Loch Ard, which is drained in turn by the Laggan.  

== Industry ==

The [[slate]] [[Quarry|quarries]] on Craigmore which operated from the [[1820s]] to the [[1950s]] are now defunct; at its peak this was a major [[industry]]. Other industries included an ironworks, established in the [[1720s]], as well as wool spinning and a lint mill.  In 1880 a railway line from [[Glasgow]], via Dumgoyne, to Aberfoyle was established.  However, due to the [[Beeching Axe]], the line was closed in [[1959]].  

The above industries have since died out, and Aberfoyle is supported mainly by the forestry industry and [[tourism]].

== Tourism ==

Visitors were first attracted to Aberfoyle and the surrounding area after the publication of ''[[Lady_of_the_Lake|The Lady of the Lake]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]] in 1810. The poem described the beauty of [[Loch Katrine]].  Aberfoyle describes itself as 'The Gateway to the [[Trossachs]]', and is well situated for visitors to access attractions such as [[Loch Lomond]] and [[Inchmahome Priory]] at the [[Lake of Menteith]].  Aberfoyle is also part of the [[Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park]].

== Historical Figures ==

Aberfoyle has connections to many historical figures such as [[Robert Roy MacGregor|Rob Roy]] and [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary Queen of Scots]].  Robert Roy MacGregor was born at the head of nearby Loch Katrine, and his well known cattle stealing exploits took him all around the area surrounding Aberfoyle.  There currently stands a tree in the village that MacGregor was reputed to have climbed and hid in to escape the clutches of the law.  Also, Mary Queen of Scots visited nearby Inchmahome Priory often as a child, and during her short reign.  She also used the priory during her short reign, particularly in 1547, where she felt safe from the English Army.

However, the most local historical figure is the Reverend Robert Kirk, born in 1644. It was the Rev. Kirk who provided the first translation into [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaidhlig]] of the Book of Psalms, however, he is better remembered for the publication of his book ''&quot;The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies&quot;'' in 1861.  Kirk had long been researching fairies, and the book collected several personal accounts and stories of folk who claimed to have encountered them.  It was after this, while Kirk was minsiter of Aberfoyle parish, that he died in unusual circumstances.  

Kirk had long believed that the local Doon Hill (or Fairy Knowe as it is more commonly known), was the gateway to the 'Secret Commonwealth', or the land of the Fairies.  It was a place that Kirk visited often, taking daily walks there from his manse.  The story goes that the Fairies of Doon Hill were angry with the Rev. Kirk for revealing their secrets, and decided to imprison him in Doon Hill - for one night in May 1692, the Rev. Kirk went out for a walk to the hill, in his nightshirt.  Some accounts claim that he simply vanished, however he suddenly collapsed.  He was found and brought home, but died soon afterwards.  He was buried in his own kirkyard, although local legends claim that the fairies took his body away, and the coffin contains only stones. The huge pine tree that still stands at the top of Doon Hill is said to contain Kirk's imprisoned spirit.

Kirk's cousin, Graham of Duchray, was then to claim that the spectre of Kirk had visited him in the night, and told him that he had been carried off by the Fairies.  Having left his widow expecting a child, the spectre of Kirk told Graham that he would appear at the baptism, whereupon Graham was to throw an iron knife at the apparition, thus freeing Kirk from the Fairies' clutches. However when Kirk's spectre appeared, Graham was apparently too shocked by the vision to throw the knife, and Kirk's ghost faded away forever.

Today, visitors to Doon Hill write their wishes on pieces of white silk, or other white cloth, and tie them to the branches of the trees for the Fairies to grant.  It is also said that if you run around the great pine tree at the summit seven times, then the Fairies will appear.

'''Abergavenny''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Abergafenni'' or ''Y Fenni'') is a market town in [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]]. It is 14 miles west of [[Monmouth]]. Situated at the confluence of a small stream called the Gavenny with the [[River Usk]], it is almost surrounded by lofty hills. The town was formerly walled, and contains the remains of a castle built soon after the [[Norman Conquest]], frequently the scene of border strife. It is in the [[Welsh Marches]].

The church of St Mary belonged originally to a [[Benedictine]] monastery founded early in the 12th century.  The existing building, however, is [[Gothic architecture|Decorated and Perpendicular]].

Abergavenny, often known as 'Aber' to the locals, was the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] ''Gobannium,'' a small fort guarding the road along the valley of the Usk for keeping the peace among the hill tribes. There is practically no trace of this fort.  The name is associated with the Celtic smith god [[Govannon]]. Abergavenny (Bergavenny) grew under the protection of the lords of Abergavenny, whose title dated from [[William I of England|William I]] (the Conqueror). 

Owing to its situation, the town was frequently embroiled in the border warfare of the 12th and 13th centuries, and [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] relates how in [[1173]] the castle was seized by the Welsh. [[Hamelyn de Baalun]], first lord of Abergavenny, founded the Benedictine [[priory]], which was subsequently endowed by [[William de Braose]] with a tenth of the profits of the castle and town. At the dissolution of the priory part of this endowment went towards the foundation of a free [[grammar school]], the site itself passing to the Gunter family.  During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] prior to the siege of [[Raglan Castle]] in [[1645]], [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] visited Abergavenny, and presided in person over the trial of Sir Trevor Williams and other [[Parliamentarian|Parliamentarians]].

In [[1639]] Abergavenny received a charter of incorporation under the title of bailiff and burgesses.  A charter with extended privileges was drafted in [[1657]], but appears never to have been enrolled or to have come into effect.  Owing to the refusal of the chief officers of the corporation to take the [[oath of allegiance]] to [[William III of England|William III]] in [[1688]], the charter was annulled, and the town subsequently declined in prosperity.  

Chapter 28 of the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542|1535 Act of Henry VIII]], which provided that Monmouth, as [[county town]], should return one burgess to Parliament, further stated that other ancient Monmouthshire boroughs were to contribute towards the payment of the member.  In consequence of this clause Abergavenny on various occasions shared in the election, the last instance being in [[1685]].  Reference to a market at Abergavenny is found in a charter granted to the prior by William de Braose (d. [[1211]]).  The right to hold two weekly markets and three yearly [[fair|fairs]], as held ever since, was confirmed in [[1657]].  Abergavenny was celebrated for the production of Welsh [[flannel]], and also for the manufacture, whilst the fashion prevailed, of goats' hair [[wigs|periwigs]]. 

The title of [[Baron Abergavenny]], in the Neville family, dates from Edward Neville (d. [[1476]]), who was the youngest son of the 1st Earl of Westmoreland by Joan Beaufort, daughter of John of Gaunt.  He married the heiress of Richard, Earl of Worcester, whose father had inherited the castle and estate of Abergavenny, and was summoned in [[1392]] to parliament as Lord Bergavenny.  Edward Neville was summoned to parliament with this title in [[1450]].  His direct male descendants ended in [[1387]] in Henry Neville, but a cousin, Edward Neville (d. [[1622]]), was confirmed in the barony in [[1604]].  From him it has descended continuously, the title being increased to an earldom in 1784; and in [[1876]] [[William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny|William Nevill]] (sic) 5th earl (b. [[1826]]), an indefatigable and powerful supporter of the conservative party, was created 1st [[Marquess of Abergavenny]].

Abergavenny is the home of Abergavenny Thursdays Football Club, which was formed in 1927 and is currently a member of the Gwent County League Division 3. The club's current position comes within 15 years of their being one of the top sides in Welsh football, winning the old format Welsh Football League in 1991 and 1992 but being relegated in 1993 after just one season in the newly formed League of Wales. The club suffered relegation from the Welsh Football League in 2001 and has since slipped through the next two divisions into its current position, although the future is now looking brighter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abersychan''' is a town in [[Wales]], near [[Newport]].

It lies in the narrow upper valley of the [[Afon Llwyd]] on the eastern edge of the great coal and iron mining district of [[Glamorgan]] and [[Monmouthshire]], and its large industrial population was employed in the mines and ironworks. There are no longer any working coalmines in the area.  Visitors can get a taste of what valley life was like by visiting the [[Big Pit]] mining museum in [[Blaenavon]], located 4 miles north. Here you can take underground tours in a perfectly preserved coalmine.

'''Abertillery''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Abertyleri'') is a town in the county borough of [[Blaenau Gwent]] and the traditional county of [[Monmouthshire]] in southern [[Wales]], 16 miles north-west of [[Newport]], originally on the [[Great Western Railway]].  Its population rose steeply during the period of mining development in the [[Rhondda]] valleys, being 10,846 in the [[1891]] census and 21,945 ten years later.  It lies in the mountainous mining district of [[Monmouthshire]] and [[Glamorganshire]], in the valley of the [[Ebbw Fach]], and the population was traditionally employed in the numerous coalmines, ironworks and tinplate works, now mostly defunct.  Farther up the same valley are the mining townships of [[Nantyglo]] and [[Blaina]].

Abertillery has a traditional-style town centre and several small schools. Today, its population numbers around 11,000. Noted for its unspoilt rural scenery, Abertillery neighbours the small districts of [[Aberbeeg]] and [[Cwmtillery]].  This is mainly down large amounts of EU funding which has helped the town transform itself from industrial relic into the clean, modernised area it is today.

A recent [[windfarm]] proposal above the community of [[Cwmtillery]] has been withdrawn, despite the offer of community-based incentives from the company.  Opposition to the proposal generated support throughout the town which led to the it finally being withdrawn.

The town's name is pronounced with the emphasis on the penultimate syllable, ie. it rhymes with &quot;Mary,&quot; as in a song made popular by Welsh entertainer [[Ryan Davies]]:

&quot;''Blodwen and Mary'' from Abertillery...&quot;

'''Aberystwyth'''  (from the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Mouth of the Ystwyth'') is a historic [[market town]],  and seaport of [[Ceredigion]] (Cardiganshire), [[Mid Wales]].

It is situated near the [[confluence]] of the rivers [[River Ystwyth|Ystwyth]] and [[River Rheidol|Rheidol]], about midway down the length of [[Cardigan Bay]]. Aberystwyth was a [[contributory parliamentary borough]] until the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act]], which caused its representation to be merged into that of the county in [[1885]].  In modern times Aberystwyth has become a Welsh educational centre.  The population is around 12,000, but is swelled by an additional 8000 students associated with the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]]. The world's first department in international politics was established in Aberystwyth in [[1919]]. 

==Geography==
[[Image:Aberystwyth 2.JPG|thumb|300px|Aberystwyth, viewed from the nature reserve on Penglais Hill]]

The [[Cambrian Line]] railway links Aberystwyth with [[Shrewsbury]], and the [[Vale of Rheidol Railway]], which is operated by [[steam locomotive]]s, can be taken to [[Devil's Bridge (Wales)|Devil's Bridge]].  Aberystwyth is a major tourist centre and a cultural link between the north and south of [[Wales]].  It has a [[pier]] and a fine sea-front which stretches from Constitution Hill at the north end of the Marine Terrace to the mouth of the harbour. Constitution Hill is scaled by the [[Aberystwyth Electric Cliff Railway]] giving access to fine views and other attractions at the top.

Although the town is relatively modern, it contains a number of historic buildings, including the remains of the castle and the &quot;imposing but fantastic structure&quot; of the old buildings of the University College of Wales near the Castle Hill.  The new campus lies to the east of the town.

The architecture is a mix of Gothic, Classical reival and Victorian, and the town is sometimes reffered to as &quot;the Oxford of Wales&quot;.

==Brief Information==
Much of the finest scenery in [[Mid Wales]] lies within easy reach of Aberystwyth including the wilderness of the [[Cambrian Mountains]], whose valleys contain forests and meadows which have little changed in centuries.  The town is generally regarded as the capital of Mid Wales, and several institutions have regional offices there.  Perhaps the most important of the public bodies located in Aberystwyth is the [[National Library of Wales]].  The library also incorporates the [[National Screen and Sound Archive of Wales]], one of six British regional film archives. The [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]], which maintains and curates the [[National Monuments Record of Wales]] (NMRW), provides the public with information about the built heritage of Wales, available through [[COFLEIN]] the online interactive mapping and database for the NMRW.

Aberystwyth is [[town twinning|twinned]] with [[Saint-Brieuc]], [[France]].

==History==

[[Image:Aberysarms.PNG|thumb|250px|Arms of Aberystwyth]]
The remains of an Iron Age fortress on [[Pen Dinas]], a hill overlooking Aberystwyth, indicate that the site was inhabited before 700 BCE.  However the recorded history of Aberystwyth may be said to date from the building of a fortress on the present Castle Hill, in [[1109]].  [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] rebuilt [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]]'s castle in [[1277]], after its destruction by the Welsh.  Between the years [[1404]] and [[1408]] [[Aberystwyth Castle]] was in the hands of [[Owain Glyndwr]], but finally surrendered to Prince Harry (the future King [[Henry V of England]]). Shortly after this the town was incorporated under the title of Ville de Lampadarn (the ancient name of the place being Llanbadarn Gaerog, or the fortified Llanbadarn, to distinguish it from [[Llanbadarn Fawr]], the village one mile inland).  It is thus styled in a charter granted by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], but by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s time the town was invariably termed Aberystwyth in all documents.  In [[1647]] the Parliamentarian troops razed the castle, so that its remains are now inconsiderable, though portions of three towers still exist.

The [[Cambrian Railway]] line from Machynlleth reached Aberystwyth in the [[1860s]] closely followed by rail links to [[Carmarthen]]. Its arrival gave rise to something of a [[Victorian]] tourist boom and the town was once even billed as the &quot;Biarritz of Wales&quot; [http://www.gigaflop.demon.co.uk/aber/AberAdvS.gif]. During this time a number of hotels and fine town houses were built including the Queens Hotel.  One of the largest of these hotels  'The Castle Hotel' was never completed as a hotel but following bankruptcy was sold cheaply to the 'Welsh National University Committee', a group of people dedicated to the creation of a Welsh University.  The University College of Wales (later to become the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]]) was founded in [[1872]] in this building.  Aberystwyth was the first university institution to be established in Wales. 

The [[Vale of Rheidol Railway]] narrow gauge line from Devil's Bridge was constructed in 1901 and 1902, intended to ship mineral traffic, primarily lead, from Devils Bridge down to Aberystwyth for trans-shipment.  By the time it was finished the lead mines were in a deep downturn and it therefore came to rely largely on the tourist industry. The railway opened for passengers in December 1902.

On the night of Friday 14th January [[1938]] a storm with estimated wind speeds of up to 90mph struck the town. Most of the promenade was destroyed, along with 200ft of the pier. Most properties on the seafront were damaged, most severely on Victoria Terrace.

[[Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg]] held their historic first protest in Aberystwyth, back in [[1963]], and here also the first ever independent Welsh [[evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Church was established (see [[Evangelical Movement of Wales]]).

[[Merched y Wawr]] have their national headquarters in Aberystwyth.

Aberystwyth hosted the [[National Eisteddfod]] in [[1865]], [[1916]], [[1952]] and [[1992]].

On March 1, 2005, Aberystwyth was granted [[Fairtrade Town]] status.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abettor''' (from ''to abet,'' O. [[Frisian language|Fr.]] ''abeter'', ''a'' and ''beter'', to bait, urge dogs upon any one; this word is probably of Scandinavian origin, meaning to cause to bite), is a law term implying one who instigates, encourages or assists another to commit an offence.

An abettor differs from an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] in that he must be present at the commission of the crime; all abettors (with certain exceptions) are principals, and, in the absence of specific statutory provision to the contrary, are punishable to the same extent as the actual perpetrator of the offence.  A person may in certain cases be convicted as an abettor in the commission of an offence in which he or she could not be a principal, e.g. a woman or boy under fourteen years of age in aiding rape, or a solvent person in aiding and abetting a bankrupt to commit offences against the bankruptcy laws.

More recently, an abbetor is generally known as an [[accomplice]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abeyance ''' (from the Old French ''abeance'' meaning &quot;gaping&quot;), a state of expectancy in respect of property, titles or office, when the right to them is not [[vesting|vested]] in any one person, but awaits the appearance or determination of the true owner.  In law, the term abeyance can only be applied to such future estates as have not yet vested or possibly may not vest.  For example, an estate is granted to A for life, with [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] to the heir of B.  During B's lifetime, the remainder is in abeyance, for until the death of B it is uncertain who his heir is.  Similarly the [[Freehold (real property)|freehold]] of a [[benefice]], on the death of the incumbent, is said to be in abeyance until the next incumbent takes possession.  

==Law of peerages==
The most common use of the term is in the case of English [[peerage]] dignities.  Most such peerages pass to [[Order of succession#Salic Law|heirs-male]], but the ancient [[barony|baronies]] created by [[hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writ]], as well as some very old [[earldom]]s, pass instead to [[Order of succession#Primogeniture|heirs-general]], also known as ''male primogeniture''.  In this system, sons are preferred from eldest to youngest, the heirs of a son over the next son, and and any son over daughters, but there is no preference among daughters: they or their heirs inherit equally.

If the daughter is an only child or her sisters are deceased and have no living issue, she (or her heir) is vested with the title; otherwise, since a peerage cannot be shared nor divided, the dignity goes into abeyance between the sisters or their heirs, and is held by no one.  If through lack of issue, marriage or both, eventually only one person represents the claims of all the sisters, he or she can claim the dignity as a matter of right, and the abeyance is said to be terminated.  On the other hand, the number of prospective heirs can grow quite large, since each share potentially can be divided between daughters.

A co-heir may petition the Crown for a termination of the abeyance.  The Crown may choose to grant the petition, but if there is there is any doubt whatsoever as to the pedigree of the petitioner, the claim is normally referred to the [[Peerage law#Peerage disputes|Committee for Privileges]].  If the claim is unopposed, the Committee will generally award the claim, unless there is evidence of [[collusion]], the peerage has been in abeyance for more than a century, or if the petitioner holds less than one-third of the claim.

It is entirely possible for a peerage to remain in abeyance for centuries. For example, the [[Baron Grey of Codnor|Barony of Grey of Codnor]] was in abeyance for over 490 years between [[1496]] and [[1989]], and the [[Baron Hastings|Barony of Hastings]] was similarly in abeyance for over 299 years from [[1542]] to [[1841]]. Some other baronies became abeyant in the thirteenth century, and the abeyance has yet to be terminated.  The only titles other than a barony that have yet gone into abeyance are the [[Baron Arlington|earldom of Arlington and the viscountcy of Thetford]], which are united. 

Titles in the [[Peerage of Scotland]] cannot go into abeyance. In Scotland, the eldest sister is preferred over younger sisters; sisters are not considered equal coheirs.

It is common, but incorrect, to speak of peerage dignities which are dormant (i.e. unclaimed) as being in abeyance.

'''Abiogenesis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''a-bio-genesis'', &quot;non biological origins&quot;) is, in its most general sense, the generation of life from non-living matter.  Today the term is primarily used to refer to theories about the chemical [[origin of life]], such as from a  [[primordial soup]]. Earlier notions of abiogenesis, now more commonly known as  '''spontaneous generation''', held that living organisms are generated by decaying organic substances, e.g. that mice spontaneously appear in stored grain or maggots spontaneously appear in meat. (That idea, which has long been known to be incorrect, will be called &quot;Aristotelian abiogenesis&quot; in this article.)

==History of abiogenesis hypotheses==
''Aristotelian abiogenesis'', also known as ''spontaneous generation'', (and, in older texts, ''Generatio aequivoca, Generatio primaria, archegenesis, autogenesis,'' and ''archebiosis''), was the theory according to which fully formed living organisms sometimes arise from not-living matter.  [[Aristotle]] explicitly taught this form of abiogenesis, and laid it down as an observed fact that some animals spring from putrid matter, that [[aphid]]s arise from the dew which falls on plants, that [[flea]]s are developed from putrid matter, that mice come from dirty hay, and so forth. Alexander Ross, in commenting on Sir [[Thomas Browne]]'s doubt as to &quot;whether mice may be bred by putrefaction&quot;, gives a clear statement of the common opinion on abiogenesis held until about two centuries ago.  Ross wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
So may he (Sir Thomas Browne) doubt whether in cheese and timber worms are generated; or if beetles and wasps in cows' dung; or if butterflies, locusts, grasshoppers, shellfish, snails, eels, and such like, be procreated of putrefied matter, which is apt to receive the form of that creature to which it is by formative power disposed.  To question this is to question reason, sense and experience.  If he doubts of this let him go to [[Egypt]], and there he will find the fields swarming with mice, begot of the mud of Nylus, to the great calamity of the inhabitants.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The first step in the scientific refutation of the theory of Aristotelian abiogenesis was taken by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Francesco Redi]], who, in 1668, proved that no maggots were ''bred'' in meat on which flies were prevented by wire screens from laying their eggs.  From the seventeenth century onwards it was gradually shown that, at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, spontaneous generation did not occur, but that [[omne vivum ex ovo]], every living thing came from a pre-existing living thing. 

The invention of the [[microscope]] carried the refutation further.  In 1683 [[Antoni van Leeuwenhoek]] discovered bacteria, and it was soon found that however carefully organic matter might be protected by screens, or by being placed in stoppered receptacles, putrefaction set in, and was invariably accompanied by the appearance of myriad bacteria and other low organisms.  As knowledge of microscopic forms of life increased, so the apparent possibilities of abiogenesis increased, and it became a tempting hypothesis that whilst the higher forms of life arose only by generation from their kind, there was a perpetual abiogenetic fount by which the first steps in the evolution of living organisms continued to arise, under suitable conditions, from inorganic matter. This was mostly disproved by [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], who, in 1768, proved that [[microbe]]s came from the air, and could be killed by boiling. His work paved the way for Louis Pasteur.

It was due chiefly to [[Louis Pasteur]] that the occurrence of abiogenesis in the microscopic world was disproved as much as its occurrence in the macroscopic world. If organic matter were first sterilized and then prevented from contamination from without, putrefaction did not occur, and the matter remained free from microbes.  The nature of sterilization, and the difficulties in securing it, as well as the extreme delicacy of the manipulations necessary, made it possible for a very long time to be doubtful as to the application of the phrase ''omne vivum ex vivo'' to the microscopic world, and there still remain a few belated supporters of abiogenesis.  Subjection to the temperature of boiling water for, say, half an hour seemed an efficient mode of sterilization, until it was discovered that the spores of bacteria are so involved in heat-resisting membranes, that only prolonged exposure to dry, baking heat can be recognized as an efficient process of sterilization.  Moreover, the presence of bacteria, or their spores, is so universal that only extreme precautions guard against a re-infection of the sterilized material.  It was thus concluded definitely that all known living organisms arise only from pre-existing living organisms.

== Chemical evolution ==
''Main article:'' [[Origin of life]]

The experiments of Louis Pasteur disproved Aristotelian abiogenesis, but they say nothing about chemical evolution, which is assumed to happen under totally different conditions and far longer timespans. 

Many scientists, such as [[T. H. Huxley]], postulate a &quot;primordial archebiosis&quot;, in which the living organisms observed in the present world had originally arisen in a series of stages from non-living matter.

Unlike Aristotelian abiogenisis, chemical evolution does not propose the spontaneous creation of complex lifeforms out of anorganic substances, but a complex process with several stages. The core of any chemical evolution are self-catalytic molecules. 

''See also:'' [[Hypercycle]], [[RNA world hypothesis]], [[proteinoid]], [[Miller experiment]].

==Critics==
The modern concept of abiogenesis has been criticised by scientists such as [[Fred Hoyle|Sir Fred Hoyle]] and [[Hubert Yockey]]; who were not, however, biologists. Leading biologists point to fundamental assumptions in their arguments which have little to no bearing on abiogenesis theories or research.  Francis Crick should here be mentioned as an exception.

===Yockey===
Information theorist Hubert Yockey argued that chemical evolutionary research raises the question: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Research on the origin of life seems to be unique in that the conclusion has already been authoritatively accepted &amp;#8230; . What remains to be done is to find the scenarios which describe the detailed mechanisms and processes by which this happened.

One must conclude that, contrary to the established and current wisdom a scenario describing the [[genesis]] of life on earth by chance and natural causes which can be accepted on the basis of fact and not faith has not yet been written. (Yockey, 1977.  A calculation of the probability of spontaneous biogenesis by information theory, ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' '''67:'''377&amp;#8211;398, quotes from pp. 379, 396.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a book he wrote 15 years later, Yockey argued that the idea of abiogenesis from a primordial soup is a failed [[paradigm]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although at the beginning the paradigm was worth consideration, now the entire effort in the primeval soup paradigm is self-deception on the [[ideology]] of its champions. &amp;#8230; 

The history of science shows that a paradigm, once it has achieved the status of acceptance (and is incorporated in textbooks) and regardless of its failures, is declared invalid only when a new paradigm is available to replace it. Nevertheless, in order to make progress in science, it is necessary to clear the decks, so to speak, of failed paradigms. This must be done even if this leaves the decks entirely clear and no paradigms survive. It is a characteristic of the true believer in [[religion]], philosophy and ideology that he must have a set of beliefs, come what may (Hoffer, 1951). Belief in a primeval soup on the grounds that no other paradigm is available is an example of the logical fallacy of the false alternative. In science it is a virtue to acknowledge [[ignorance]]. This has been universally the case in the history of science as Kuhn (1970) has discussed in detail. There is no reason that this should be different in the research on the origin of life. (Yockey, 1992. ''Information Theory and Molecular Biology'', p. 336, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] Press, UK, ISBN 0-521-80293-8).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Yockey, in general, possesses a highly critical attitude toward people who give credence toward natural origins of life, often invoking words like &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;ideology&quot;. Yockey's publications have become favorites to quote among [[creationist]]s, though he is not a creationist himself (as noted in this 1995 email [http://www.asa3.org/archive/evolution/199602/0125.html]).

===Panspermia advocates===
[[Panspermia]], the idea that life came to Earth from elsewhere in the universe, is viewed by some as a criticism of abiogenesis. However, panspermia hypotheses simply transfer the ''origin problem'' elsewhere without offering a solution, so it does not necessarily address or criticize abiogenesis.

====Crick====
[[Francis Crick]], [[molecular biologist]] and [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]], most noted for being one of the co-discoverers of the structure of the [[DNA]] molecule, and [[chemist]] [[Leslie Orgel]] co-proposed [[Panspermia#Directed Panspermia|Directed Panspermia]] as the mechanism through which life started on Earth.

====Hoyle====
[[Fred Hoyle|Sir Fred Hoyle]], with [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]], was a proponent of [[Panspermia]], first proposed by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Anaxagoras]].  Hoyle became a staunch [[Fred_Hoyle#Rejection_of_chemical_evolution|critic of chemical evolution]] to explain the [[Naturalism (Philosophy)|naturalistic]] [[origin of life]].  Critics have shown that Hoyle's understanding of evolution is radically out of touch with modern biology. Although the hypothesis of panspermia is not in conflict with the idea of abiogenesis, Hoyle's interpretation of panspermia is in conflict.
&lt;!-- Section may be appropriate, but did not contain any actual religious criticism of the theory. Compare version prior to 25-Apr-2005.

'''Anders Celsius''' ([[November 27]], [[1701]] &amp;ndash; [[April 25]], [[1744]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[astronomy|astronomer]].

Celsius was born at [[Uppsala]] in [[Sweden]]. He was professor of astronomy at [[Uppsala University]] from [[1730]] to [[1744]], but traveled from [[1732]] to [[1735]] visiting notable observatories in [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[France]].

At [[Nuremberg]] he published in [[1733]] a collection of 316 observations of the [[aurora borealis]] made by himself and others over the period 1716-1732. 
In [[Paris]] he advocated the measurement of an arc of the meridian in [[Lapland]], and in [[1736]] took part in the expedition organized for that purpose by the [[French Academy of Sciences]].

Celsius was the founder of the [[Uppsala Astronomical Observatory]] in [[1741]]. He is best known for the [[Celsius]] [[temperature]] scale, first proposed in a paper to the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in [[1742]].

He died of [[tuberculosis]] in [[Uppsala]]. The [[Celsius (crater)|Celsius crater]] on the [[Moon]] is named for him.

'''Adam Carolla''' (born [[May 27]], [[1964]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[comedy|comedic]] [[radio personality]] and [[television personality]], best known for co-hosting the radio show ''[[Loveline]]'' and ''[[The Man Show]]'' on TV. 

Carolla was born to an [[Italian American]] father and a [[Hungarian American]] mother. He attended [[North Hollywood High School]], where he was voted class clown and was the [[captain (sports)|captain]] of his [[American football|football]] team but never received good grades, graduating with a very low 1.75 [[grade point average]]. Carolla began living on his own at the age of 18 and briefly attended [[Los Angeles Valley College]], a [[junior college]], before dropping out to work in a series of jobs, such as a [[carpet]] cleaner, [[carpenter]], and [[boxing]] instructor. 

In his spare time he worked on his comedy skills, training with [[Acme Comedy Theater]] and attempting [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up]], but he didn't believe either of these were a good fit for him. In his late twenties he heard an ad on the radio seeking a boxing instructor to train [[Jimmy Kimmel]], who at the time was a radio personality on the [[KROQ]] morning show [[Kevin and Bean]] as Jimmy the Sports Guy. Carolla met Kimmel at the radio station and the two became best friends. Carolla eventually joined the show's repertoire as Mr. Birchum, the [[Vietnam veteran]] shop teacher. 

Carolla was offered the job of co-hosting ''[[Loveline]]'' with [[physician]] [[Dr. Drew Pinsky]] in 1995, replacing [[Riki Rachtman]]. ''Loveline'' is a [[radio syndication|syndicated]] radio program produced by [[Westwood One]], and was also for several years a television show for [[MTV]]. On ''Loveline'', Carolla often gave extended commentary about matters having little to do with the official subject matter of the show. Common topics included his dislike of religion, junior college, traffic/parking enforcement,  and political extremists and his preference for pie over cake (along with a great many other topics). Carolla brought to the show his ability to naturally add a humorous slant to the callers' problems.

Carolla then went on to do ''[[The Man Show]]'' with Kimmel on [[Comedy Central]] from 1999 to 2003. He left ''The Man Show'' at the same time as his good friend Kimmel, even after having been reportedly offered $100,000 per episode to stay on. 

Carolla has continued his work with Kimmel as a writer and regular guest on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]''. With partner [[Daniel Kellison]], they are the heads of [[Jackhole Productions]] and created another television show named ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' for Comedy Central, which revived the Mr. Birchum character.

Carolla has also done [[voiceover]]s for [[cartoon]]s, including Commander Nebula on the [[Disney Channel|Disney]] animated series ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'', [[Death (personification)|Death]] on ''[[Family Guy]]'' (replacing [[Norm MacDonald]]) and Spanky Ham on ''[[Drawn Together]]''.

In early [[August 2005]], Carolla began hosting the [[talk show]] ''[[Too Late with Adam Carolla]]'' on Comedy Central.

On [[August 4]], [[2005]], Carolla announced that he would leave ''Loveline'' to pursue a position in morning radio, replacing [[Howard Stern]] in a number of morning markets.  Adam's last night on ''Loveline'' was [[November 3]], [[2005]], to allow him to have time to prepare for his morning debut at the beginning of 2006. On [[October 25]], [[Infinity Broadcasting]] announced that it would be replacing Stern with Carolla on several radio stations in the [[West Coast of the United States|western United States]]. On [[January 3]], [[2006]], Carolla began his new morning radio show, ''[[The Adam Carolla Show]]'', on stations in Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco, Portland, San Diego, Seattle, Las Vegas, Fresno and Sacramento.  As of [[January 6]], [[2006]], east coast and Dallas affiliates were already in discussions with CBS Radio, to drop [[David Lee Roth]] and substitute Carolla.  

Circa [[August 15]], [[2005]], Carolla became a member of the advisory board of [[Marijuana Policy Project]] after devoting nearly an entire episode of his Comedy Central show to talking with ''[[Weeds (television)|Weeds]]'' star [[Kevin Nealon]] about the absurdities of the war on marijuana. [http://www.mpp-vip.org/home/]

Carolla's morning show became the subject of controversy within a few weeks of airing when on [[January 24]], [[2006]], Carolla played a segment which spoofed the upcoming [[Asian Excellence Awards]], which honor [[Asian American]] media accomplishments. The spoof consisted of what sounded like a typical excerpt from an awards show, except that the dialogue of the actors consisted only of the words &quot;ching&quot; and &quot;chong&quot;, repeated  [http://capwiz.com/napalc/utr/1/ENBVFKNCNE/EOVTFKNCVB/592959946 over and over]. (The actual award show was conducted in English.) Branding the segment as demeaning and racist, several Asian American organizations (such as the [[NAAAP]]) threatened to ask advertisers to withdraw their support from the show if the station did not issue an apology. [http://www.aaja.org/news/mediawatch/2006_01_27_1/] [http://asianamericanmedia.org/rf_cms/index.php?cmd=showPage&amp;page_id=1.11.2.4.5] On [[February 22]], [[2006]], Carolla without fanfare read a brief apology for the segment, in which he said that his show had regrettably [http://www.angryasianman.com/other/adamcarolla2006-02-22.mp3 &quot;crossed the line&quot;].

Carolla often says on-air that he is now, &quot;''literally'' a millionaire. Literally&quot;. He married his longtime girlfriend [[Lynette Paradise]] in 2002, and they are currently expecting twins.

Although raised as a [[Christian]], Carolla is an [[atheist]].

== Earnings ==

Adam is fond of pressuring guests to reveal their earnings for a magazine layout, TV show, commerical, etc. To be fair he reveals his earnings on-air.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autocorrelation''' is a mathematical tool used frequently in [[signal processing]] for analysing functions or series of values, such as [[time domain]] [[signal (information theory)|signals]]. It is the [[cross-correlation]] of a signal with itself.  Autocorrelation is useful for finding repeating patterns in a signal, such as determining the presence of a periodic signal which has been buried under noise, or identifying the fundamental frequency of a signal which [[missing fundamental|doesn't actually contain that frequency component]], but implies it with many [[harmonic]] frequencies.

== Definitions ==

Different definitions of autocorrelation are in use depending on the field of study which is being considered and not all of them are equivalent.  In some fields, the term is used interchangeably with [[autocovariance]].  

=== Statistics ===

In [[statistics]], the autocorrelation of a discrete [[time series]] or a process ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is simply the [[correlation]] of the process against a time-shifted version of itself.  If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[stationary process|second-order stationary]] with mean &amp;mu; then this definition is

:&lt;math&gt;R(k) = \frac{E[(X_i - \mu)(X_{i+k} - \mu)]}{\sigma^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where E is the [[expected value]] and ''k'' is the time shift being considered (usually referred to as the lag).  This function has the attractive property of being in the range [&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;1] with 1 indicating perfect correlation (the signals exactly overlap when time shifted by ''k'') and &amp;minus;1 indicating perfect anti-correlation.  It is common practice in many disciplines to drop the normalisation by &amp;sigma;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and use the term ''autocorrelation'' interchangeably with ''autocovariance''.

=== Signal processing ===

In signal processing, given a signal f(t), the continuous autocorrelation ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;tau;) is the continuous cross-correlation of ''f''(''t'') with itself, at lag ''&amp;tau;'', and is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;R_f(\tau) = f^*(-\tau) \circ f(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t+\tau)f^*(t)\, dt = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)f^*(t-\tau)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' represents the [[complex conjugate]] and the circle represents [[convolution]].  For a real function, ''f&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''f''.

Formally, the discrete autocorrelation ''R'' at lag ''j'' for signal ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is 

&lt;!-- :''R(j) = E{(x(iin)-m)(x(n-j)-m)]}'', --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(j) = \sum_n (x_n-m)(x_{n-j}-m )\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;!-- the [[expected value]] operator ''E{}'' is taken over ''n'', and --&gt; ''m'' is the [[average]] value ([[expected value]]) of ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. Quite frequently, autocorrelations are calculated for zero-centered signals, that is, for signals with zero mean. The autocorrelation definition then becomes 

&lt;!-- :''R(j) = E[x(n)x(n-j)]'', --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(j) = \sum_n x_n x_{n-j}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Multi-[[dimension]]al autocorrelation is defined similarly.  For example, in three dimensions the autocorrelation would be defined as 

&lt;!-- :''R(j,k,l) = E{[x(n,q,r)-m][x(n-j,q-k,r-l)-m]}''. --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(j,k,\ell) = \sum_{n,q,r} (x_{n,q,r}-m)(x_{n-j,q-k,r-\ell}-m).&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties ==

In the following, we will describe properties of one-dimensional autocorrelations only, since most properties are easily transferred from the one-dimensional case to the multi-dimensional cases.

* A fundamental property of the autocorrelation is symmetry, ''R''(''i'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''R''(&amp;minus;''i''), which is easy to prove from the definition. In the continuous case, the autocorrelation is an even function
 
::&lt;math&gt;R_f(-\tau) = R_f(\tau)\,&lt;/math&gt;

:when ''f'' is a real function, and an [[Hermitian]] function 

::&lt;math&gt;R_f(-\tau) = R_f^*(\tau)\,&lt;/math&gt;

:when ''f'' is a complex function.

* The continuous autocorrelation function reaches its peak at the origin, where it takes a real value, i.e. for any delay ''&amp;tau;'', &lt;math&gt;|R_f(\tau)| \leq R_f(0)&lt;/math&gt;.  This is a consequence of the [[Cauchy-Schwarz inequality]].  The same result holds in the discrete case.

* The autocorrelation of a [[periodic function]] is, itself, periodic with the very same period.

* The autocorrelation of the sum of two completely uncorrelated functions (the cross-correlation is zero for all &amp;tau;) is the sum of the autocorrelations of each function separately.

* Since autocorrelation is a specific type of [[cross-correlation]], it maintains all the properties of cross-correlation.

* The autocorrelation of a [[white noise]] signal will have a strong peak at &amp;tau;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and will be close to 0 for all other &amp;tau;.  This shows that a sampled instance of a white noise signal is not statistically correlated to a sample instance of the same white noise signal at another time.  &lt;!-- If white noise is added to a periodic signal, the autocorrelation of the  resulting function will... --&gt;

* The [[Wiener-Khinchin theorem]] relates the autocorrelation function to the [[spectral density|power spectral density]]  via the [[Fourier transform]]:

::&lt;math&gt;R(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty S(f) e^{j 2 \pi f \tau} \, df&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;S(f) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty R(\tau) e^{- j 2 \pi f \tau} \, d\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

* One application of autocorrelation is the measurement of [[optical spectrum|optical spectra]] and the measurement of very-short-duration [[light]] [[ultrashort pulse|pulses]] produced by [[laser]]s, both using [[optical autocorrelation|optical autocorrelators]].

* In optics, normalized autocorrelations and cross-correlations give the [[degree of coherence]] of an electromagnetic field.

* In [[signal processing]], autocorrelation can give information about repeating events like [[music]]al [[beat]]s or [[pulsar]] [[frequency|frequencies]], even though it cannot tell the position in time of the beat.

The following example show the autocorrelation of a rendered [[MIDI]] file with [[The Blue Danube]] (on the left), and its autocorrelation (only the first 4 seconds are shown) of it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Atlas Autocode''' (AA) was a [[programming language]] developed at Manchester University for the [[Atlas Computer]]. It was developed by Tony Brooker as an improvement on the [[ALGOL]] [[programming language]]s, removing some of Algol's poorer features such as passing parameters by name.  It featured explicitly typed variables, subroutines and functions.  The AA compiler generated range-checking for array accesses, and the language allowed an array to have dimensions that were determined at run-time (i.e. you could declare an array as &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;integer&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;array&lt;/u&gt; Thing (i:j)&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; were calculated values).  Atlas Autocode included a &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;complex&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt; data type which would support imaginary numbers (eg the square root of -1), a feature which was dropped when the language later morphed into the [[Edinburgh IMP]] programming language.  (Imp was an extension of AA and was notable for being used to write the [[Edinburgh Multiple Access System|EMAS]] [[operating system]].)

Keywords in AA were represented as being underlined, however for the sake of easy typing it was possible to [[Stropping|strop keywords]] by placing a &quot;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;&quot; sign in front of them, for example
the keyword &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;endofprogramme&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt; could be typed as &lt;code&gt;%end %of %programme&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;%endofprogramme&lt;/code&gt;


There were no reserved words in the language.  In the statement &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;if&lt;/u&gt; token=if &lt;u&gt;then&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;result&lt;/u&gt; = token&lt;/code&gt;, there is both a keyword &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;if&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a variable named &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;.

Because of this keyword stropping, it was possible for AA to allow spaces in variable names, such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;integer&lt;/u&gt; previous value&lt;/code&gt;.  Spaces were not significant and were removed prior to parsing in a trivial pre-lexing stage called &quot;line reconstruction&quot;.
What the compiler would see in the above example would be &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;if&lt;/u&gt;token=if&lt;u&gt;thenresult&lt;/u&gt;=token&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

The syntax for expressions was very close to mathematical standards and allowed implicit multiplication such as &lt;code&gt;z = 3x + y&lt;/code&gt; as an alternative to the more common &lt;code&gt;z = x * 3 + y&lt;/code&gt;.

Atlas Autocode's syntax was influenced by the output device which the author had available, a Flexowriter.  Consequently it allowed symbols like &quot;&amp;frac12;&quot; and superscripts for &quot;&lt;math&gt;i^2&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.  The flexowriter supported overstriking and therefore AA did as well - up to three characters could be overstruck as a single symbol.  For example the character set had no &quot;&amp;uarr;&quot; symbol, so exponentiation was an overstrike of &quot;|&quot; and &quot;*&quot;.  (The underlining of keywords mentioned above could also be done using overstriking.)  The language is described in detail in the [http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/atlasautocode.html Atlas Autocode Reference Manual].

When AA was ported to the [[KDF9]] computer, the character set was changed to ISO and that compiler has actually been recovered from an old paper tape by the [http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/ Edinburgh Computer History Project] and is available online, as is a high-quality scan of the original Atlas Autocode manual.

Atlas Autocode's second-greatest claim to fame (after being the progenitor of Imp and EMAS) was that it was the original &quot;[[Compiler-compiler|Compiler Compiler]]&quot; of which &quot;[[Yacc]]&quot; was a later derivative.  A variant of the AA compiler included run-time support for a top-down recursive descent parser.  The style of parser used in the Compiler Compiler was in use continuously at Edinburgh from the 60's until almost the turn of the millennium.

Other [[Autocode]]s were developed for the [[Titan (computer)]] (a prototype Atlas 2) at Cambridge and the [[Ferranti]] Mercury.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arthur J. Stone''' ([[1847]]-[[1938]]) a leading American silversmith, was trained and worked in [[Sheffield]], [[England]], and [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], before coming to the United States in [[1884]]. He was one of the last silversmiths in America to train apprentices to carry out designs in hand-wrought silver. In 1901, Stone set up a workshop in [[Gardner]], [[Massachusetts]] which operated under his name until its sale in [[1937]] to Henry Heywood. Heywood was a Gardner businessman, who renamed it The Stone Silver Shop, and later, Stone Associates. Heywood died in [[1945]]. His sons Henry, Jr. and Jerome ran Stone Associates until [[1957]].
