An '''antipope''' is one whose claim to being [[Pope]] is the result of a disputed or contested election. These antipopes were usually in opposition to a specific person chosen by the papal electors (since the [[Middle Ages]], the [[College of Cardinals]]; in the twentieth century, their special secret meeting, called [[conclave]], however applies the age limit for eligibility). Some self-appointed leaders of smaller churches are also called &quot;antipopes.&quot;

==History==
During certain periods of turbulence in the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]], controversial Papal elections were conducted. Some such elections were considered invalid, either because a large majority of papal electors claimed the election was invalid (such as the election of [[Amadeus VIII of Savoy|Felix V]]), or because they have subsequently been declared invalid (such as [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]]). 

The earliest antipope, [[Antipope Hippolytus|Hippolytus]], was elected in protest against [[Pope Callixtus I]] by a schismatic group in the city of [[Rome]] in the [[3rd century]]. Hippolytus was [[exile]]d to the mines on the island of [[Sardinia]] in the company of Callixtus' successor [[Pope Pontian]], and was reconciled to the Catholic Church before his death and has been [[canonization|canonized]] by the Church. The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] also mentions a Natalius[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10448a.htm], before Hippolytus, as first antipope, who, according to Eusebius's EH5.28.8-12, quoting the ''Little Labyrinth'' of Hippolytus, after being &quot;[[Scourge|scourged]] all night by the holy angels&quot;, covered in ash, dressed in [[sackcloth]], and &quot;after some difficulty&quot;, tearfully submitted to [[Pope Zephyrinus]].

The period when antipopes were most numerous was during the struggles between the Popes and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s of the [[11th century|11th]] and [[12th century|12th centuries]]. The emperors would frequently sponsor antipopes in order to further their cause. (The popes, likewise, frequently sponsored rival imperial claimants in Germany in attempts to disrupt imperial policy.)

The late [[14th century|14th]] and early [[15th century]] saw a series of rival popes elected, one line of which is counted by the Roman Catholic Church as popes and the other as antipopes. The scandal of multiple claimants added to the demands for reform that produced the [[Protestant Reformation]] at the turn of the [[16th century]]. (See [[Western Schism]], [[Antipope Benedict XIII]].)

It was not evident, during periods when two (or three) rival claimants existed, which was the antipope, and which was the pope, and the clear-cut distinctions made between them in retrospect can give a false sense that certainty existed among their contemporaries. Supporters might offer assistance to a given candidate, but could not know which would be determined to have been an antipope, and which the pope, until events had run their course. 

There has not been an antipope since [[1449]] (unless ''[[Antipope#Sedevacantist antipopes|Sedevacantist antipopes]]'' are counted - see below). Other schisms such as the [[Church of England]], the [[Old Catholic Church]] and the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]] began in a rejection of a primary [[dogma]] of the papacy.

Today the act of becoming an Antipope is considered a schismatic act by the Roman Catholic Church.  This would result in automatic [[excommunication]] for the person who became Antipope.

==Sedevacantist antipopes==
Some breakaway Catholics today, called [[Sedevacantism|sedevacantists]], claim the current Popes are heretics for various reforms which sedevacantists see as innovations in the practices of Roman Catholic Church which were adopted during the reigns of Pope [[John XXIII]] and Pope [[Paul VI]], including aspects of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Chief among these criticized reforms is the replacing of the [[Tridentine Latin Mass]] with the [[Novus Ordo Missae]].  Many sedevacantists also object to the celebration of the Mass in the [[vernacular]], despite the fact that various provisions existed for the celebration of the Mass in the vernacular prior to the reign of Pope John XXIII. Since the opinion of many Catholic theologians is that a [[heretic]]al Pope would cease to be Catholic and therefore cease to be Pope, sedevacantists believe the current Bishops of Rome are not actually popes. Some sedevacantist groups have their own popes to replace the popes they reject. They are sometimes called antipopes, although it should be noted that in contrast to historical antipopes, the number of their followers is minuscule. Some of these antipopes have developed their own religious infrastructure in recognition that the conventional popes are not likely to consider ceding authority to them, thus being at once antipopes of the ''Universal Church'' and popes of their particular sect.

Sedevacantist antipopes frequently refer to the conventional successors of [[Pope Pius XII]] as a series of antipapacies.

There is a significant number of antipopes self-proclaimed Peter II, due to the special meaning of this name; see [[Antipope Peter II]].

=== Antipopes of the 20th-21st centuries ===
====[[Palmarian Catholic Church]]====
* [[Clemente Domínguez y Gómez]] (Gregory XVII), mystically self-proclaimed from [[1978]]&amp;ndash;2005 in [[Spain]], pope of the [[Palmarian Catholic Church]].
* [[Manuel Corral|Manuel Alonso Corral]] ([[Antipope Peter II|Peter II]]), succeeded  Gregory XVII as the Pope of the [[Palmarian Catholic Church]] in 2005 in [[Spain]]

====[[Reformed Church of Christ]]/[[Apostles of Infinite Love]]====
*[[Michel-Auguste-Marie Collin]] (Clement XV), self-proclaimed [[1963]] in [[Clémery]], [[France]] (later at [[St. Jovite]], [[Canada]]), Pope of the &quot;[[Renewed Church of Christ]]&quot; or &quot;[[Church of the Magnificat]]&quot; 
* [[Jean-Gaston Tremblay]] (Gregory XVII), succeeded Clement XV in [[1968]] in [[Canada]]; not to be confused with the Canadian politician [[Gaston Tremblay]]

====[[Conclavist]] movements====
These antipopes are (for the most part) not self-proclaimed in the strictest sense but organized and held elections of 'faithful' Catholics.  The verifiable smallest of these '[[Conclave]]s' was attended by only 6 electors, the size of the largest is not known but claimed to be at least larger than the conclave which elected [[Pope Pius XII]].

* [[David Bawden]] (Michael I), self-proclaimed in [[1990]] in [[Kansas]], [[United States|United States of America]] (&quot;conclave&quot; of 6 electors)
* [[Victor von Pentz]] (Linus II), either self-proclaimed in [[1994]] in [[Hertfordshire]], [[United Kingdom]] or elected by several Sedevacantists in [[Assisi]] (disputed)
* [[Lucian Pulvermacher]] (Pius XIII), self-proclaimed in [[1998]] in [[Montana]], [[United States|United States of America]], Pope of the self-proclaimed &quot;[[true Catholic Church]]&quot;.  Claims to have been elected by a conclave of a secret number but at least 61 electors.
* [[Reinaldus Michael Benjamins]] (Antipope Gregory XIX) self-proclaimed in [[2001]] in [[New York]], [[United States of America]].

====Independents and Antipopes of other groups====
* [[Gino Frediani]] (Emmanuel I), self-proclaimed from [[1973]]&amp;ndash;[[1984]] in [[Italy]], Pope of the &quot;[[New Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus]]&quot;
* [[Valeriano Vestini]] (Valeriano I), self-proclaimed in [[1990]] in [[Province of Chieti|Chieti]], [[Italy]]
* [[Maurice Archieri|Maurice Archieri of Le Perreux]]  ([[Antipope Peter II|Peter II]]) of Le Perreux,  self-proclaimed in [[1995]] in [[France]]
* [[Julius Tischler]]  ([[Antipope Peter II|Peter II]]) of [[Germany]]
* [[Pierre Henri Bubois]]  ([[Antipope Peter II|Peter II]]) of [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]
* [[Chester Olszewski]] ([[Antipope Peter II|Peter II]]), self-proclaimed in [[1980]] of [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States|USA]]
* [[William Kamm]]  ([[Antipope Peter II|Peter II]]) of [[Australia]], Pope of the &quot;Order of Saint Charbel&quot; movement.

'''Aquaculture'''  is the cultivation of the natural produce of water (such as fish or shellfish, algae and other aquatic plants).  [[Mariculture]] is specifically [[ocean|marine]] aquaculture, and thus is a subset of aquaculture. Some examples of aquaculture include raising [[catfish]] and [[tilapia]] in freshwater ponds, growing [[pearl|cultured pearls]], and farming [[salmon]] in net-pens set out in a bay. [[Fish farming]] is a common type.

== History ==
The practice of aquaculture is very ancient and found in many cultures. 

Aquaculture was used in [[China]] circa [[2500 BC]]. When the waters lowered after river floods, some fishes, namely [[Common carp|carps]], were held in artificial lakes. Their brood were later fed using [[nymph (biology)|nymph]]s and feces from [[silkworm]]s used for silk production.

The Hawaiian people practiced aquaculture by constructing [[fish pond]]s (see [[Hawaiian aquaculture]]). A remarkable example from [[ancient Hawaii]] is the construction of a fish pond, dating from at least 1,000 years ago, at Alekoko. According to legend, it was constructed by the mythical [[Menehune]].

The Romans were quite adept in breeding fish in ponds. In Europe it became common again in monasteries during the [[Middle Ages]], since fish was scarce and thus expensive. Transportation improvements in the 19th century made fish easily available and inexpensive, even far from the seas, causing a decline in aquaculture.

The current boom in aquaculture started in the 1960s as prices for fish began to climb.  Wild fish capture was reaching its peak and the human population was continuing to rise.  Today, commercial aquaculture exists on a unprecedented, huge scale. In the 1980s open-netcage salmon farming was also expanding; this particular type of aquaculture technology is still a minor part of the production of farmed finfish worldwide, but evidence of its negative impact on wild stocks, which started coming to light in the late 1990s, has caused it to be a major cause of controversy.[http://www.davidsuzuki.org/Oceans/Aquaculture/Salmon/]

==Benefits==
Aquaculture has been one of the fastest growing segments of global [[food]] production in recent decades, and has been hailed as an answer to the limits of wild fish stock harvest. 

Fish and other aquacultured species are generally very efficient converters of feedstuffs into high quality protein when compared to other farmed animals. For example a catfish may take 6 kg of feed (wet weight to wet weight) to produce 1 kg of catfish whereas a chicken might take 10 kg and a pig 30 kg. This is possible primarily because aquaculture species are cold-blooded (or more corectly - poikilothermic), and hence do not waste energy on heating, and because the physics of the aquatic environmment require little energy for movement. Fish and other aquacultured species also tend to be comprised of a higher percentage of edible weight than terrestrial species. 

Farming of high value (and often overexploited) species can reduce presure on wild stocks.    

There are inumerable aquatic species farmed in small quantities around the world. Major aquaculture industries around the world include (Apology: latin names are from top of head and may be mis-spelled):

'''Atlantic salmon (''Salmo salar'') and Rainbow trout (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'').''' Also smaller volumes of a variety of other salmonids. Originally developed in Norway, Denmark (Rainbow trout although it is an American species) and Scotland, now farmed in significant quatities in Europe, Canada, Chile and Australia (Tasmania). First or Second in the world for production value.

'''Tropical shrimp; Mostly Black tiger shrimp (''Penaeus monodon'') and increasingly White shrimp (''Litopenaeus vannemi'').''' Techniques originally developed in Japan and Taiwan. Mostly farmed through tropical and sub-tropical Asia and South America. First or Second in the world for production value.

'''Carps; European carp, Chinese carps (Grass, Silver and Black) and Indian major carps''' are easily the largest global aquaculture industry by volume of production but are low in value. Major producers are China, India, Southeat Asia and Europe. China's reported production figures are considered contentious by some authorities. Value of production is also debatable according to whether value is calculated at border (exchange rate) prices or PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) prices. Nonetheless, carps are major contributors of high quality protein to the diets of poorer people around the world.

'''Seaweeds; Many species.''' Huge volumes, low value. Mostly farmed in Asia; particuarly Japan, Korea and China.

'''Catfish; Major species are Vietmanese basa (), Channel catfish and African and Asian walking catfish (''Clarias'' sp.).''' Mostly farmed in Asia and the Southern United States.

'''Tilapia; Nile tilapia and a few other species'''. Very well suited species to subsistance farming although arguably not well suited to large aquabusiness due to finicky breeding biology and low flesh recovery (Although becoming a very successful import in the US and Europe). Mostly farmed in Asia, South America and Africa. 

'''Oysters; [[Pacific oyster]] (''Crassostrea gigas''), American oyster (''Crassostrea virginica''), Flat oyster (''Ostrea edulis'')''' and others. Mostly farmed in Asia, US, Australia-New Zealand and Europe. Flat oyster was once a huge industry and low cost/very high quality food for the masses in Europe but collapsed under mortalities brought about by the parasite ''Bonamia''.

'''Mussels; Blue mussel (''Mytilus edulis''), Green mussels (''Perna'' sp.)''' Mostly farmed in Europe, Asia, New Zealand and South America.

These industries are often based in developing countries, and can contribute greatly to food security/quality and income there. Of those industries above, all but Tropical shrimp and salmonids have a low -evel environmental impact. The environmental footprint of the Tropical shrimp and salmonid industries is improving.

[[Tuna]] farming in [[Australia]] has seen financial success. Tuna farming at present is really a fattening enterprise, where wild bred juvenile tuna are captured and grown in pens to a larger size and better flesh quality. Having the fish confined in pens also means that harvests can be timed to suit the market. This practice has resulted (at least in Australia) on reduced pressure on wild populations and a much larger value for their relatively small wild (Southern bluefin) tuna quota. Relatively recently, researchers in Japan have closed the life cycle of the Pacific bluefin tuna, and European researchers in Spain are working on breeding Northern bluefin tuna.

While the negative impacts of some aquaculture on the environment has been widely publicised, the positive environmental effects of aquaculture are rarely noted. For example many aquacultured species are highly sensitive to water quality conditions and aquaculture farmers often notice the effects of pollution or reductions in water quality before other authorities. Aquaculture businesses have a vested interest in clean waterways, in that a reduction in water quality has a direct effect on their production rates and financial bottom line. Appropriate aquaculture development can serve as 'canaries' for the health of waterways, with farms often  a very new and undeveloped industry when compared to terrestrial aquacultures. Only a few species (Atlantic salmon, Pacific white shrimp and possibly several species each of catfish, carp and tilapia) are currently on their way to becoming true domesticated aquabuisiness species in the way that poultry, beef and pork have long been. While the aquaculture industry is still only a small way into the development curve the inherent biological characteristics of aquatic animals bode well for the future contribution of aquatic farming to living standards and the environment.

==Challenges==
In countries like the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], [[Canada]], [[Norway]], and [[Chile]], [[salmon]] and [[trout]] farming are one of the fastest-growing forms of [[agriculture]]. Salmon farming is not increasing in the United States because of heavy competition from other countries, and higher environmental standards for fish farms in the US. Salmon farming, like other food producing operations such as [[beef]], [[wheat]] or [[tomato]]es can impact the environment. 

However, the difference between shore farming and fish farming is that shore farming takes place on private land, while fish farming often takes place on the public waters.  Organic wastes from fish cages can have a significant effect on water quality and the population structure of organisms, beyond the boundaries of the fish pens, increasing the occurrence of toxic [[algal bloom]]s.  Scotland, as well as Chile and China, has had serious toxic algae blooms.  Algal blooms can cause the death of huge numbers of wild fish and other species, and great harm to wild fisheries.  However, even a month of fallow time can return the area to pristine condition.

Like other agriculture production, aquaculture must stand up to a rigorous evaluation of any environmental impact. Salmon aquaculture has come under increasing scrutiny from environmental [[nongovernmental organization]]s (ENGO's). In Canada, salmon farming sites occupy a small portion of the coastal zone areas where they are located. The total area occupied by Canadian salmon farms in [[British Columbia]] and the [[Bay of Fundy]] in New Brunswick is about 8,900 acres (36 km²) which is less than 0.01% of the coastal area where these sites are located. Still, even though salmon farms occupy only a small percentage of the public waters, scientists have found a significant degradation of the areas where they exist, with lowered oxygen levels, replacement of native seaweeds with invasive seaweeds, increased algal blooms, reduction of wild species, and loss of nursery habitat for wild fish.     

Wild Pacific and Atlantic salmon stocks have seen significant declines over the last several decades, before salmon farming operations started. These declines were caused by a combination of factors including [[climate change]], [[overfishing]] and freshwater habitat destruction. However, rivers with fish farms have experienced accelerated decline of wild stocks caused by spread of diseases such as infectious salmon anemia, and parasites such as sea lice from farmed to wild salmon. 

Concerns have been raised on the East coast that wild Atlantic salmon may interbreed with and catch disease from salmon that escape from farms. Canadian salmon farmers have significantly reduced the escape of their salmon. The evidence shows that the escape of farmed salmon on Canada's west coast poses low risk to Pacific salmon. However, young wild salmon swimming down river to the ocean are free of sea lice parasites before they swim past the salmon farms, and laden with sea lice after they pass the farms.  Most die from these sea lice. 

Many farmed fish species are [[carnivore|carnivorous]], meaning that other wild fish species must be harvested to maintain the fish farm.  For example, herring are used to make salmon feed.  Since herring are the backbone of the North Atlantic food chain, increased fishing pressure on their numbers is a serious threat to all other fish species which depend on herring for food. It is argued that fish farms, far from removing the pressure on wild fish stocks, increase it. Others argue that it takes less fish (in the form of the fishmeal component of an aquaculture diet) to produce a unit of table fish through aquaculture than through the natural food web. Fisheries that are based on species lower on the trophic web (such as many species used for fishmeal) are also more resistant to overfishing than typical table fish fisheries.  

The fish farm industry is trying to decrease its reliance on fish for fish feed. The vast majority of aquaculture production on the global scale (species such as carps, catfish and tilapia) occurs with the use of feeds with very little or no fishmeal. A portion of the fish meal used in fish feeds for highly carnivorous species comes from the trimmings and discards of commercial species.  More  studies are being done concerning shifts in feed composition using poultry and vegetable oils as substitutes for fish protein &amp; oil. However this use of land based feed ingredients results in a decrease of the Omega 3 fish oils in the farmed fish (although in some cases a 'washing out' of the terrestrial oils can be achieved with a short period of feeding with marine oils prior to harvest). The current relectance to further reduce fishmeal and marine oils in the commercial diets of species such as the salmonids and shrimps is not based so much on technical difficulties as consumer resistance to the taste and health qualities of vegetarian fish. In the long term, alternative sources of long chain Omega 3 fatty acids (the most difficult ingredient to source from non fish sources) may be developed from zooplankton or microalgal origins. 

Other problems with aquaculture include the potential for increasing the spread of unwanted [[invasive species]], as farmed species are often not native to the area in which they are farmed. When these species escape, they can compete with native species and damage ecosystems. Another problem is the spread of introduced parasites, pests, and diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[computer science]], the '''Kolmogorov complexity''' (also known as '''descriptive complexity''', '''Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity''', '''stochastic complexity''', '''algorithmic entropy''', or '''program-size complexity''') of an object such as a piece of text is a measure of the computational resources needed to specify the object. For example consider the following two [[string (computer science)|string]]s of length 100

 0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101
 
 1100100001100001110111101110110011111010010000100101011110010110001101111111010001100011011001110111

The first string admits a short [[English language]] description namely &quot;50 repetitions of '01'&quot;. The second one has no obvious simple description other than writing down the string itself.

More formally, the complexity of a string is the length of the string's shortest description in some fixed description language.  The sensitivity of complexity relative to the choice of description language is discussed below. It can be shown that the Kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be too much larger than the length of the string itself.  Strings whose  Kolmogorov complexity is small relative to the string's size are not considered to be complex. 
The notion of Kolmogorov complexity is surprisingly deep and can be used to state and prove impossibility results akin to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] and  [[halting problem|Turing's halting problem]]. 

Algorithmic information theory is the area of computer science that studies Kolmogorov complexity and other complexity measures on strings (or other [[data structure]]s).  The field was developed by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], [[Ray Solomonoff]] and [[Gregory Chaitin]] starting in the late [[1960s]]. There are several variants of Kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information. The most widely used one is based on self-delimiting programs and is mainly due to [[Leonid Levin]] (1974).

== Definition==

To define Kolmogorov complexity, we must first specify a description language for strings.  Such a description language can be based on a programming language such as  [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]], [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], or [[Java virtual machine]] bytecode.  If '''P''' is a program which outputs a string ''x'', then '''P''' is a description of ''x''. The length of the description is just the length of '''P''' as a character string.  In determining the length  of '''P''', the lengths of any subroutines used in '''P''' must be accounted for.  The length of any integer constant ''n'' which occurs in the program '''P''' is  the number of bits required to represent ''n'', that is (roughly) log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''n''.

We could alternatively choose an encoding for [[Turing machine|Turing machines]] (TM), where an ''encoding'' is a function  which associates to each TM  '''M''' a bitstring &lt;'''M'''&gt;.  If '''M''' is a TM which on input ''w'' outputs string ''x'', then the concatenated string &lt;'''M'''&gt; ''w'' is a description of ''x''.  For theoretical analysis, this approach is more suited for constructing detailed formal proofs and is generally preferred in the research literature. In this article we will use an informal approach.

Fix a description language.  Any string ''s'' has at least one description, namely the program

  '''function''' GenerateFixedString()
     '''return''' ''s''

Among all the descriptions of ''s'', there is one with shortest length denoted ''d''(''s''). In case there is more than one program of the same minimal length, choose one arbitrarily, for example selecting the lexicographically first among them. ''d''(''s'') is the '''minimal description''' of ''s''. The '''Kolmogorov complexity''' of ''s'', written ''K''(''s''), is
:&lt;math&gt;K(s) = |d(s)|. \quad &lt;/math&gt;
In the other words, ''K''(''s'') is the length of the minimal description of ''s''.

We now consider how the choice of description language affects the value of ''K'' and show that the effect of changing the description language is bounded. 

'''Theorem'''. If ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the complexity functions relative to description languages ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then there is a constant ''c'' (which depends only  on the languages ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) such that
: &lt;math&gt; |K_1(s) - K_2(s)| \leq c, \quad \forall s &lt;/math&gt;

By symmetry, it suffices to prove that there is some constant ''c'' such that for all bitstrings ''s'',
: &lt;math&gt; K_1(s) \leq K_2(s) + c. &lt;/math&gt;

To see why this is so,  there is a program in the language ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which acts as an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

   '''function''' InterpretLanguage('''string''' ''p'')

where ''p'' is a program in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The interpreter is characterized by the following property: 

: Running InterpretLanguage on input ''p'' returns the result of running ''p''. 

Thus if '''P''' is a program in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  which is a minimal description of ''s'', then InterpretLanguage('''P''') returns the string ''s''. The length of this description of ''s'' is the sum of 
# The length of the program InterpretLanguage, which we can take to be the constant ''c''.
# The length of '''P''' which by definition is ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'').

This proves the desired upper bound.

See also [[invariance theorem]].

==Basic results==

In the following, we will fix one definition and simply write ''K''(''s'') for the complexity of the string ''s''. 

It is not hard to see that the minimal description of a string cannot be too much larger than the string itself: the program GenerateFixedString above that outputs ''s'' is a fixed amount larger than ''s''.

'''Theorem'''. There is a constant ''c'' such that 
:&lt;math&gt; K(s) \leq |s| + c, \quad \forall s &lt;/math&gt;

The first surprising result is that there is no way to effectively compute ''K''. 

'''Theorem'''.  ''K'' is not a [[computable function]].

In other words, there is no program which takes a string ''s'' as input and produces the integer  ''K''(''s'') as output.  We show this by contradiction. Suppose there is a program 

   '''function''' KolmogorovComplexity('''string''' ''s'')

that takes as input a string ''s'' and returns ''K''(''s''). Now consider the program

   '''function''' GenerateComplexString('''int''' ''n'')
      '''for''' i = 1 to infinity:
         '''for''' each string s of length exactly i
            '''if''' KolmogorovComplexity(''s'') &gt;= ''n''
               '''return''' ''s''
               '''quit'''

This program calls KolmogorovComplexity as a subroutine.  This program tries every string, starting with the shortest, until it finds a string with complexity at least ''n'', then returns that string. Therefore, given any positive integer ''n'', it produces a string with Kolmogorov complexity at least as great as ''n''. The program itself has a fixed length ''U''. The input to the program GenerateComplexString is an integer ''n''; here, the size of ''n'' is measured by the number of bits required to represent ''n'' which is log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''). Now consider the following program: 
  
   '''function''' GenerateParadoxicalString ()
       '''return''' GenerateComplexString(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)

This program calls GenerateComplexString as a subroutine and also has a free parameter
''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  This program outputs a string ''s'' whose complexity is at least ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  By an auspicious choice of the parameter ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; we will arrive at a contradiction.  To choose this value, note ''s'' is described by the  program GenerateParadoxicalString whose length is at most 

:&lt;math&gt; U + \log_2(n_0) + C  \quad &lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the &quot;overhead&quot; added by the program GenerateParadoxicalString. Since ''n'' grows faster than log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), there exists a value  ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that 
:&lt;math&gt; U + \log_2(n_0) + C &lt; n_0. \quad &lt;/math&gt;
But this contradicts the definition of having a complexity at least ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus the  program named &quot;KolmogorovComplexity&quot; cannot actually generate strings with the desired Kolmogorov complexity. 

This is proof by contradiction where the contradiction is similar to the [[Berry paradox]]: &quot;Let ''n'' be the smallest positive integer that cannot be defined in fewer than twenty English words. Well, I just defined it in fewer than twenty English words.&quot;

== Compression ==

It is however straightforward to compute upper bounds for ''K''(''s''): simply [[data compression|compress]] the string ''s'' with some method, implement the corresponding decompressor in the chosen language, concatenate the decompressor to the compressed string, and measure the resulting string's length.

A string ''s'' is compressible by ''c'' if it has a description whose length does not exceed  |''s''| &amp;minus; ''c''.  This is equivalent to saying ''K''(''s'') &amp;le; |''s''| &amp;minus; ''c''.  Otherwise ''s'' is incompressible by ''c''. A string incompressible by one is said to be simply ''incompressible''; by the [[pigeonhole principle]], incompressible strings must exist, since there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; bit strings of length ''n'' but only 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; shorter strings, that is strings of length ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

For the same reason, &quot;most&quot; strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be significantly compressed: ''K''(''s'') is not much smaller than |''s''|, the length of ''s'' in bits.  To make this precise, fix a value of ''n''.  There are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; bitstrings of length ''n''. The [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform]] [[probability]] distribution on the space of these bitstrings assigns to each string of length exactly ''n'' equal weight 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. 

'''Theorem'''. With the uniform probability distribution on the space of bitstrings of length ''n'', the probability that a string is incompressible by ''c'' is at least 1 &amp;minus; 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''c''+1 &lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  

To prove the theorem, note that the number of descriptions of length not exceeding ''n'' &amp;minus; ''c'' is given by the [[geometric series]]:

:&lt;math&gt; 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{n-c} = 2^{n-c+1}-1.\quad &lt;/math&gt;

There remain at least

:&lt;math&gt; 2^n-2^{n-c+1}+1 \quad &lt;/math&gt;

many bitstrings of length ''n'' that are incompressible by ''c''.  To determine the probability divide by 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

This theorem is the justification for various challenges in [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/compression-faq/part1/ comp.compression FAQ]. Despite this result, it  is sometimes claimed by certain individuals (considered [[Crank (person)#Physics, computer science and mathematics|cranks]]) that they  have produced algorithms which uniformly compress data without lossage. See [[lossless data compression]].

==Chaitin's incompleteness theorem == 

We know that most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be described in any significantly &quot;compressed&quot; way. However, it turns out that the fact that a specific string is complex cannot be formally proved,  if the string's length is above a certain threshold. The precise formalization is as follows. First fix a particular [[axiomatic system]] '''S''' for the [[natural number|natural numbers]].  The axiomatic system has to be powerful enough so that to certain assertions  '''A''' about complexity of strings one can be associate a formula '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sub&gt; in '''S'''.  This association must be such that if '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sub&gt; is  provable in '''S''', then the corresponding assertion '''A''' is true. This &quot;formalization&quot;  can be achieved either by an artificial encoding such as a [[Gödel numbering]] or by a formalization which more clearly respects the intended interpretation of '''S'''.

'''Theorem'''. There exists a constant ''L'' (which only depends on the particular axiomatic system and the choice of description language) such that there is no string ''s'' for which the statement
: &lt;math&gt; K(s) \geq  L \quad &lt;/math&gt;
(as formalized in '''S''') can be proven within the axiomatic system '''S'''.  Note that by the abundance of nearly incompressible strings, the vast majority of those statements must be true. 

The proof of this result is modeled on a self-referential construction used in [[Berry's paradox]]. The proof is by contradiction. If the theorem were false, then 

:'''Assumption (X)''': For any integer ''n'' there exists a string ''s'' for which there is a proof in '''S''' of the formula &quot;''K''(''s'') &amp;ge; ''n''&quot; (which we assume can be formalized in '''S'''). 

We can find an effective enumeration of all the formal proofs in '''S''' by some procedure

   '''function''' NthProof('''int''' ''n'')
which takes as input ''n'' and outputs some proof. This function
enumerates all proofs. Some of these are proofs for formulas we do not
care about here (examples of proofs which will be listed by the procedure NthProof are the various known proofs of the [[law of quadratic reciprocity]], those of [[Fermat's little theorem]] or the proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]] all translated into the formal language of '''S'''). A small fraction are complexity formulas of the form ''K''(''s'') &amp;ge; ''n'' where ''s'' and ''n'' constants in the language of '''S'''. There is a program

   '''function''' NthProofProvesComplexityFormula('''int''' ''n'')

which determines whether the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; proof actually proves
a complexity formula ''K''(''s'') &amp;ge; ''L''. The strings ''s'' and
the integer ''L'' in turn are computable by programs:
    
   '''function''' StringNthProof('''int''' ''n'')

   '''function''' ComplexityLowerBoundNthProof('''int''' ''n'')

Consider the folowing program

   '''function''' GenerateProvablyComplexString('''int''' ''n'')
      '''for''' i = 1 to infinity:
         '''if'''  NthProofProvesComplexityFormula(i) '''and''' 
             ComplexityLowerBoundNthProof(i) &gt;= ''n'' 
               '''return''' StringNthProof(''i'')
               '''quit'''

Given an ''n'', this program tries every proof until it finds a string
and a proof in the formal system '''S''' of the formula ''K''(''s'') &amp;ge; ''n''. The program
terminates by our '''Assumption (X)'''. Now this program has a length ''U''.
There is an integer ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''U'' + log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''C''  &lt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''C'' is the overhead cost of

    '''function''' GenerateProvablyParadoxicalString()
       '''return''' GenerateProvablyComplexString(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)
       '''quit'''

The program GenerateProvablyParadoxicalString outputs a string ''s'' for which ''K''(''s'') &amp;ge; 
''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be formally proved in '''S'''. In particular  ''K''(''s'') &amp;ge; 
''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is true. However, ''s'' is also described by a program of length
''U''+log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)+''C''  so its complexity is less than ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  This contradiction proves '''Assumption (X)''' cannot hold.

Similar ideas are used to prove the properties of [[Chaitin's constant]].

The [[minimum message length]] principle of statistical and inductive inference and machine learning was developed by [http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~dld/CSWallacePublications/ C.S. Wallace] and D.M. Boulton in 1968.  MML is [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] (it incorporates prior beliefs) and
information-theoretic.  It has the desirable properties of statistical
invariance (the inference transforms with a re-parametrisation, such as from
polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates), statistical consistency (even
for very hard problems, MML will converge to any underlying model) and efficiency (the MML model will converge to any true underlying model about as quickly as is possible).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;'''Hymn to Proserpine'''&quot; is a [[poem]] by [[Algernon Swinburne|Algernon Charles Swinburne]], published in [[1866]]. 

The poem opens with the words ''Vicisti, Galilæe'', [[Latin]] for &quot;You have conquered, O Galilean,&quot; the apocryphal [[Famous last words|dying words]] of the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]].  He had tried to reverse the official endorsement of [[Christianity]] by the [[Roman Empire]].  The poem is cast in the form of a [[lament]] by a person professing the [[paganism]] of [[classical antiquity]] and lamenting its passing, and expresses regret at the rise of [[Christianity]]:

:''Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath;''
:''We have drunken of things [[Lethe]]an, and fed on the fullness of death.''

The poem is addressed to the [[goddess]] [[Proserpina]], the Roman equivalent of [[Persephone]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Triumph of Time''' is a poem by [[Algernon Swinburne]], published in [[1866]]. It is in adapted [[ottava rima]] and is full of elaborate use of literary devices, particularly [[alliteration]]. The theme, which purports to be autobiographical, is that of rejected love. The (male) speaker deplores the ruin of his life, and in tones at times reminiscent of ''[[Hamlet]]'', craves oblivion, for which the sea serves as a constant metaphor.

'''Alfred''' ([[849]]? &amp;ndash; [[26 October]] [[899]]) or ''Ælfred'' was king of the southern [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Wessex]] from [[871]] to [[899]].  Alfred is famous for his defence of the kingdom against the Danes ([[Vikings]]), becoming as a result the only English monarch to be awarded the [[epithet]] &quot;the Great&quot; by his people. Alfred was the first [[List of monarchs of Wessex|King of Wessex]] to style himself &quot;[[List of British monarchs|King of England]]&quot;. Details of his life are known as a result of a work by the [[Wales|Welsh]] scholar, [[Asser, Bishop of Sherborne|Asser]]. A learned man, Alfred encouraged education and improved the kingdom's law system ([[Doom book]]).

== Childhood ==
Alfred was born sometime between [[847]] and AD [[849]] at [[Wantage, England|Wantage]] in present-day [[Oxfordshire]], the fourth son of King [[Ethelwulf of Wessex]] (Æþelwulf), most likely by his first wife, [[Osburh]]. He succeeded his brother, [[Ethelred I]] (Æþelræd I), as King of [[Wessex]] and [[Mercia]] in [[871]].

He seems to have been a child of singular attractiveness and promise, and tales of his boyhood were remembered. At five years old, in [[853]], he is said to have been sent to [[Rome]], where he was confirmed by [[Pope Leo IV]], who is also said to have &quot;anointed him as king.&quot; Later writers took this as an anticipatory crowning in preparation for his ultimate succession to the throne of Wessex. That, however, could not have been foreseen in 853, as Alfred had three elder brothers living. It is likely to be understood either of investiture with the consular insignia or possibly with some titular royalty such as that of the under-kingdom of [[Kent]].

This tale is likely apocryphal, though in [[854]]&amp;ndash;[[855]] Alfred almost certainly did go with his father on a pilgrimage to [[Rome]], spending some time at the court of [[Charles the Bald]], King of the [[Franks]]. In [[858]], Ethelwulf died.

== Public life ==
During the short reigns of his two eldest brothers, [[Ethelbald of Wessex|Ethelbald]] and [[Ethelbert of Wessex|Ethelbert]], nothing is heard of Alfred. But with the accession of the third brother, Ethelred, in [[866]] the public life of Alfred began, and he began his great work of delivering England from the [[Denmark|Danes]]. It is in this reign that Asser applies to Alfred the unique title of ''secundarius,'' which seems to show a position akin to that of the [[Celt]]ic ''tanist,'' a recognized successor, closely associated with the reigning prince. It is likely that this arrangement was sanctioned by the [[Witenagemot]], to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Aethelred fall in battle. The arrangement of crowning a successor as co-king, however, is well-known among [[Germanic tribes]], such as the [[Swedes]], and the Franks, with whom the Anglo-Saxons had close ties (see [[diarchy]] and [[Germanic king]]).
[[Image:Statue d'Alfred le Grand à Winchester.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Statue of Alfred the Great at Winchester]]
In [[868]] Alfred married [[Ealhswith]], daughter of [[Aethelred Mucill]], who is called [[ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]], a folk who dwelt in [[Lincolnshire]] about [[Gainsborough, England|Gainsborough]]. She was the granddaughter of a former King of Mercia, and they had five or six children, one a daughter, [[Ethelfleda]], who would become queen of Mercia in her own right.

The same year Alfred, fighting beside his brother Ethelred, made an unsuccessful attempt to relieve Mercia from the pressure of the Danes. For nearly two years Wessex had a respite. But at the end of [[870]] the storm burst; and the year which followed has been rightly called &quot;Alfred's year of battles.&quot;

Nine general engagements were fought with varying fortune, though the place and date of two of them have not been recorded. A successful skirmish at [[Battle of Englefield]], [[Berkshire]] ([[31 December]] [[870]]), was followed by a severe defeat at the [[Battle of Reading (871)|Battle of Reading]] ([[4 January]] [[871]]), and this, four days later, by the brilliant victory of [[Battle of Ashdown]], near [[Compton Beauchamp]] in [[Shrivenham Hundred]].

On [[22 January]] [[871]] the English were again defeated at [[Basing]], and on [[22 March]] [[871]] at [[Marton, Wiltshire|Marton]], [[Wiltshire]], the two unidentified battles having perhaps occurred in the interval.

=== Accession ===
In April 871 Ethelred died, and Alfred succeeded to the whole burden of the contest.  While he was busied with the burial and associated ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the English in his absence at an unnamed spot, and once more in his presence at [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] in May. After this peace was made, and for the next five years the Danes were occupied in other parts of England, Alfred merely keeping a force of observation on the border. But in [[876]], the Danes, under a new leader, [[Guthrum the Old| Guthrum]], slipped past him and attacked [[Wareham]]. From there, early in [[877]] and under the pretext of talks, they made a dash westwards and took [[Exeter, England|Exeter]]. Here Alfred blockaded them, and a relieving fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes had to submit and withdraw to Mercia. But in January [[878]] they made a sudden swoop on [[Chippenham, Wiltshire|Chippenham]], a royal stronghold in which Alfred had been keeping his Christmas, &quot;and most of the people they reduced, except the King Alfred, and he with a little band made his way… by wood and swamp, and after Easter he… made a fort at [[Athelney]], and from that fort kept fighting against the foe&quot; (Chronicle).
[[Image:KingAlfredStatueWantage.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Alfred the Great's birthplace [[Wantage]] boasts a statue of its greatest son.]]

A legend tells how, while a fugitive in the marshes of [[Athelney]] near [[North Petherton]] in [[Somerset]], after the first Danish invasion, he was given shelter by a peasant woman who, ignorant of his identity, left him to watch some cakes she had left cooking on the fire. Preoccupied with the problems of the kingdom, Alfred let the cakes burn, and was taken to task by the woman on her return. Upon realizing the king's identity, the woman apologized profusely, but Alfred insisted that he was the one who needed to apologize. The thought that Alfred, during his retreat at Athelney, was a helpless fugitive rests upon the legend of the cakes. In truth he was organizing victory. At about the same time, he is supposed to have disguised himself as a harpist to gain entry to Guthrum's camp and discover his plans.

By the middle of May, his preparations were complete and he moved out of Athelney, being joined on the way by the levies of [[Somerset]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Hampshire]]. The Danes on their side moved out of Chippenham, and the two armies met at the [[Battle of Edington]] in Wiltshire. The result was a decisive victory for Alfred. The Danes submitted. Guthrum, the Danish king, and twenty-nine of his chief men took baptism, recorded by Asser as occuring at [[Treaty of Wedmore|Wedmore]]. As a result, [[England]] became split into two, the south-western half kept by the [[Saxons]] and the north-eastern half becoming known as the [[Danelaw]]. By the next year ([[879]]) not only Wessex, but Mercia, west of [[Watling Street]], was cleared of the invader.

Though for the time being the north-eastern half of England, including [[London]], was in the hands of the Danes, in truth the tide had turned. For the next few years there was peace, the Danes being kept busy in Europe. A landing in Kent in [[880s|884 or 885]], though successfully repelled, encouraged the East Anglian Danes to rise up. The measures taken by Alfred to repress this uprising culminated in the taking of London in [[885]] or [[886]], following which an agreement was reached between Alfred and Guthrum, the [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]].

Once more for a time there was a lull; but in the fall of [[890s|892 or 893]] the last storm burst. The Danes, finding their position in Europe becoming more and more precarious, crossed to England in two divisions, amounting in the aggregate to 330 sail, and entrenched themselves, the larger body at [[Appledore, Kent]],  and the lesser under [[Haesten]] at [[Milton, Kent|Milton]]  also in Kent. The fact that the new invaders brought their wives and children with them shows that this was no mere raid, but a meaningful attempt, in concert with the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes, to conquer England. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position whence he could observe both forces. While he was in talks with Haesten the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck north-westwards, but were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, [[Edward the Elder|Edward]], and defeated in a general engagement at [[Farnham]], and driven to take refuge on an island in the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire Colne]], where they were blockaded and ultimately compelled to submit. They then fell back on Essex, and after suffering another defeat at [[Benfleet]] coalesced with Haesten's force at [[Shoebury]].

Alfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes were besieging Exeter and an unnamed stronghold on the North [[Devon]] shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the siege of Exeter; the fate of the other place is not recorded. Meanwhile the force under Haesten set out to march up the [[Thames Valley]], possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. But they were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of Mercia, Wiltshire and Somerset, and made to head off to the northwest, being finally overtaken and blockaded at [[Buttington]], which some identify with [[Buttington Tump]] at the mouth of the [[River Wye|Wye River]], others with Buttington near [[Welshpool]]. An attempt to break through the English lines was defeated with loss; those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. Then after collecting reinforcements they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined Roman walls of [[Chester, England|Chester]]. The English did not attempt a winter blockade, but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the neighbourhood. And early in [[894]] (or [[895]]) want of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to Essex. At the end of this year and early in 895 (or [[896]]) the Danes drew their ships up the Thames and [[River Lee|Lea]] and fortified themselves twenty miles above London. A direct attack on the Danish lines failed, but later in the year Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river so as to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realized that they were out-maneuvred. They struck off northwestwards and wintered at [[Bridgenorth]]. The next year, 896 (or [[897]]), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to Northumbria, some to East Anglia; those who had no connections in England withdrew to the continent. The long campaign was over.

The result testifies to the confidence inspired by Alfred's character and generalship, and to the efficacy of the military reforms initiated by him. These were:
#the division of the ''[[fyrd]]'' or national militia into two, relieving each other at set intervals, so as to ensure continuity in military operations;
#the building of strongholds (burgs) and garrisons at certain points; 
#the enforcement of the obligations of thanehood on all owners of five hides of land, thus giving the king a nucleus of highly equipped troops.

=== Reorganization ===
After the dispersal of the Danish invaders Alfred turned his attention to the increase of the royal [[navy]], and ships were built according to the king's own designs, partly to repress the ravages of the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes on the coasts of Wessex, partly to prevent the landing of fresh hordes. This is not, as often asserted, the beginning of the English navy. There had been earlier naval operations under Alfred. One naval engagement was certainly fought under [[Aethelwulf|Æthelwulf]] (in [[851]]), and earlier ones, possibly in [[833]] and [[840]]. The partisan [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] credits Alfred with the construction of a new type of boat, 'swifter, steadier and also higher/more responsive (hierran) than the others'; but these new ships were not a great success, as we hear of them grounding in action and foundering in a storm. Nevertheless both the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[United States Navy]] claim Alfred as the founder of their traditions.  The first vessel ever commissioned into the United States Navy was [[USS Alfred|USS ''Alfred'']].

Alfred's main fighting force was separated into two, 'so that there was always half at home and half out' ([[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]). The level of organisation required to mobilise his large army in two shifts of which one was feeding the other must have been considerable.  The complexity which Alfred's administration had attained by [[892]] is demonstrated by a reasonably reliable charter whose witness list includes a ''thesaurius'', ''cellararius'' and ''pincerna''&amp;mdash;treasurer, food-keeper and butler.  Despite the irritation which Alfred must have felt in [[893]], when one division, which had 'completed their call-up (stemn)' gave up the siege of a Danish army even as Alfred was moving to relieve them, this system seems to have worked remarkably well on the whole.

One of the weaknesses of pre-Alfredian defences had been that, in the absence of a standing army, fortresses were largely left unoccupied, making it very possible for a Viking force quickly to secure a strong strategic position. Alfred substantially upgraded the state of many of Wessex's fortresses, as has been demonstrated by systematic excavation of four West Saxon boroughs (at [[Wareham]], [[Cricklade]], [[Lydford]] and [[Wallingford]]]) that &quot;in every case the rampart associated by the excavators with the borough of the Alfredian period was the primary defence on the site&quot; (N.P. Brooks ''The Development of Military Obligations in Eighth and Ninth Century England''). We know that such defences were not constructed by the occasional Danish occupiers, thanks to surviving transcripts of the formidable 11th Century administrative manuscript known as the Burghal Hidage, dated within 20 years of Alfred's death&amp;mdash;it may well date to Alfred's reign, and it almost certainly reflects Alfredian policy. This documents the established position of these four [[burh]]s, among many others, as permanently garrisoned and maintained fortress-towns. By comparing town plans of Wallingford and Wareham with that of Winchester, one can see 'that they were laid out in the same scheme' (P. Wormald in J. Campbell, ed., ''The Anglo-Saxons''). This supports the proposition that these newly established burhs were planned as centres of habitation and trade as well as a place of safety in moments of immediate danger.  

The &quot;[[Tribal Hidage|Burghal Hidage]]&quot; sets out the obligations for the upkeep and defence of these towns; in this way, the English population and its wealth was drawn into towns where it was not only safer from Viking soldiers, but also taxable by the King.

Alfred is thus credited with a significant degree of civil reorganization, especially in the districts ravaged by the Danes. Even if one rejects the thesis crediting the 'Burghal Hidage' to Alfred, what is undeniable is that, in the parts of Mercia acquired by Alfred from the Vikings, the [[shire]] system seems now to have been introduced for the first time. This is at least one grain of truth in the legend that Alfred was the inventor of shires, [[Hundred (division)|hundreds]] and [[tithing]]s. The finances also needed attention; but the subject is obscure, and we cannot accept Asser's description of Alfred's appropriation of his revenue as more than an ideal sketch. Alfred's care for the administration of justice is testified both by history and legend; and the title &quot;protector of the poor&quot; was his by unquestioned right. Of the action of the [[Witangemot]] we do not hear very much under Alfred. That he was anxious to respect its rights is conclusively proved, but both the circumstances of the time and the character of the king would tend to throw more power into his hands. The legislation of Alfred probably belongs to the later part of the reign, after the pressure of the Danes had relaxed.

=== Foreign relations ===
Asser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers, but little definite information is available. He certainly corresponded with [[Elias III]], the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|patriarch of Jerusalem]], and probably sent a mission to [[India]]. Embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the [[Pope]] were fairly frequent; while Alfred's interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of [[Orosius]].

Around 890 [[Wulfstan of Haithabu]] undertook a journey from [[Haithabu]] on [[Jutland]] along the [[Baltic Sea]] to the Prussian trading town [[Truso]]. Wulfstan reported details of his trip to Alfred the Great.

His relations to the [[Celt]]ic princes in the southern half of the island are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign the [[South Wales|Welsh]] princes, owing to the pressure on them of [[North Wales]] and Mercia, commended themselves to Alfred. Later in the reign the North Welsh followed their example, and the latter co-operated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894).  That Alfred sent alms to [[Ireland|Irish]] as well as to European monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority; the visit of the three pilgrim &quot;Scots&quot; (i.e., Irish) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic; the story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by [[St. Modwenna]], though mythical, may show Alfred's interest in that island.

=== Christianity and His Writings===
The history of the [[Christianity|church]] under Alfred is most obscure. The Danish inroads had told heavily upon it; the monasteries had been special points of attack, and though Alfred founded two or three monasteries and imported foreign monks, there was no general revival of monasticism under him. 

To the ruin of learning and education wrought by the Danes, and the practical extinction of the knowledge of Latin even among the clergy, the preface to Alfred's translation into [[Old English language|Old English]] of [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory's]] ''[[Pastoral Care]]'' bears eloquent witness. It was to remedy these evils that he established a court school, after the example of [[Charlemagne]]; for this he imported scholars like [[Grimbald]] and [[John the Saxon]] from Europe and Asser from South Wales; for this, above all, he put himself to school, and made the series of translations for the instruction of his clergy and people, most of which yet survive. These belong unquestionably to the latter of his reign, likely to the last four years, during which the chronicles are almost silent. 

Apart from the lost ''Handboc'' or ''Encheiridion,'' which seems to have been merely a commonplace-book kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ''Dialogues of Gregory,'' a book greatly popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. In this case the translation was made by Alfred's great friend [[Werferth]], Bishop of [[Worcester, England|Worcester]], the king merely furnishing a foreword. The next work to be undertaken was Gregory's ''Pastoral Care,'' especially for the good of the parish clergy. In this Alfred keeps very close to his original; but the introduction which he prefixed to it is one of the most interesting documents of the reign, or indeed of English history. The next two works taken in hand were historical, the ''Universal History'' of Orosius and [[Bede|Bede's]] ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]].'' The priority should likely be given to the Orosius, but the point has been much debated. In the Orosius, by omissions and additions, Alfred so remodels his original as to produce an almost new work; in the Bede the author's text is closely stuck to, no additions being made, though most of the documents and some other less interesting matters are omitted. Of late years doubts have been raised as to Alfred's authorship of the Bede translation. But the sceptics cannot be regarded as having proved their point.

We come now to what is in many ways the most interesting of Alfred's works, his translation of ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|The Consolation of Philosophy]]'' of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], the most popular philosophical handbook of the middle ages. Here again Alfred deals very freely with his original and though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to Alfred himself, but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is solely Alfred's and highly characteristic of his genius. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: &quot;My will was to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.&quot; The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these the writing is prose, in the other alliterating verse. The authorship of the latter has been much disputed; but likely they also are by Alfred. In fact, he writes in the prelude that he first created a prose work and then used it as the basis for his poem, the [[Lays of Boethius]], his crowning literary achievement.  He spent a great deal of time working on these books, which he tells us he gradually wrote through the many stressful times of his reign to refresh his mind.  Of the authenticity of the work as a whole there has never been any doubt. 

The last of Alfred's works is one to which he gave the name ''Blostman,'' i.e., &quot;Blooms&quot; or Anthology. The first half is based mainly on the ''Soliloquies'' of St [[Augustine of Hippo]], the remainder is drawn from various sources, and contains much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. &quot;Therefore he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear.&quot;

Beside these works of Alfred's, the Saxon Chronicle almost certainly, and a Saxon Martyrology, of which fragments only exist, probably owe their inspiration to him. A prose version of the first fifty [[Psalms]] has been attributed to him; and the attribution, though not proved, is perfectly possible.  Additionally, Alfred appears as a character in ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]],'' where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is attested. Additionally, ''[[The Proverbs of Alfred]]'', which exists for us in a 13th century manuscript contains sayings that very likely have their origins partly with the king.

=== Death ===
Alfred died on [[26 October]] [[899]], though the year is uncertain &amp;mdash; but not [[900]] or [[901]] as were previously accepted. How he died is unknown. He was originally buried in the Old Minster, then moved to the New Minster, and then transferred to Hyde Abbey in the year 1110.

==Appearance in Culture==
In honour of Alfred, the [[University of Liverpool]] now has a [[King Alfred Chair of English Literature]].

[[Thomas Augustine Arne]]'s ''[[Masque of Alfred]]'' (known for &quot;[[Rule Britannia]]&quot;) was a [[masque]] about Alfred the Great (first public performance: [[1745]]).

[[G K Chesterton]]'s poetical epic ''[[The Ballad of the White Horse]]'' describes Alfred uniting the fragmented Kingdoms of Britain to chase the northern invaders away from the island. Like [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', it deals with the theme of a divinely oriented leader waging physical and spiritual battle against a morally unjust enemy.

The [[historical fiction]] author [[Bernard Cornwell]] started, in the early 21st century, a retelling saga ''[[The Saxon Stories]]'' about Alfred's life and his struggle against the [[Vikings]]. A biography of Alfred by Justin Pollard was published in 2005.

Alfred was played by [[David Hemmings]] in the [[1969]] film ''Alfred the Great'', which co-starred [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]] as Guthrum [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064000/].

[[Alfred University]], located in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, NY]], is named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alessandro Algardi''' (Bologna [[July 31]],[[1598]] &amp;ndash; Rome, [[June 10]], [[1654]]), is mainly known as an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] [[Sculpture|sculptor]], the major rival of [[Bernini]] in the field and an outstanding draughtsman. His role as an architect rests largely on his designs for the [[Villa Doria Pamphili]], Rome (1644&amp;ndash1652) and its extensive fountains and other garden features, where much of his free-standing sculpture and bas-reliefs also remain, and for the architectonic features of his sculptural setpieces.

While apprenticed in the Bolognese atelier of [[Agostino Carracci]], Algardi's aptitude for sculpture led him to work for the sculptor [[Giulio Cesare Conventi]] (1577&amp;ndash;1640). At the age of twenty he was brought to the notice of [[Duke of Mantua|Ferdinando I, Duke of Mantua]], who gave him several commissions, which gave the young sculptor a chance to immerse himself in one of the greatand exposed the young sculptor a chance to see his large collections of Roman antiquities and sculpture. He was also much employed about the same period by goldsmiths, modelling for them in ivory and making wax ''modelli'' for casting in gold and silver.

After a short residence in [[Venice]], he went to [[Rome]] in 1625 with an introduction from the Duke of Mantua to the [[Pope Gregory XV|late pope's]] nephew, [[Ludovico Cardinal Ludovisi]], who employed him for a time in the restoration of ancient statues, which still form the core of the Bonacorsi-Ludovisi collection in [[Palazzo Altemps]]. . [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], in the first flush of his fame, had the pick of the best available commissions in Rome, and the duke's death left Algardi to his own meagre resources, and for several years he earned a precarious living from these restorations and commissions of goldsmiths and jewellers.  His friends included his fellow Bolognese, [[Domenichino]] and [[Pietro da Cortona]], and his early Roman commissions included terracotta portrait busts, while he supported himself with small works like crucifixes. 

For [[Pietro Buoncompagni]] in 1640, Algardi created his first major public work in marble, a colossal statue of [[Philip Neri]], with kneeling angels. Immediately after this, he produced a similar group, representing the beheading of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] in two figures, of the kneeling saint and the executioner poised to strike the sword-blow, for [[San Paolo Maggiore]], the church of the Barnabite Fathers in Bologna. These proficient works expressed Baroque dramatic attitudes and immediacy of expression, at once established Algardi's reputation, and other commissions quickly followed.

==Algardi Gains Papal Favor with the Ascent of Innocent X==
For two decades Bernini had dominated the most prominent commissions in Rome, however,with the accession of the Bolognese [[Pamphilj]] [[Pope Innocent X]][http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Algardi%20Alessandro/imagepages/image17.html (bust)],[http://members.tripod.com/romeartlover/Juv34.html (coat of arms)]in 1644, Algardi was employed by the Pope and the pope's nephew, [[Camillo Pamphilj]].[http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Algardi%20Alessandro/imagepages/image2.html (bust, Hermitage)]For example, he was asked to  design the [[Villa Doria Pamphili]] outside the San Pancrazio gate, a project in which he depended on the professional aid of the architect/engineer [[Girolamo Rainaldi]], while Algardi and his studio executed the sculpture-encrusted exteriors and interiors His portrait bust of Camillo Pamphili is at The [[Hermitage Museum]]. A church façade sometimes attributed to Algardi is that of Sant' Ignazio di Loyola in Campo Marzio. In [[1650]] Algardi met [[Diego Velasquez]], who obtained commissions for Spain. There are four chimneypieces by Algardi in the palace of [[Aranjuez]], where the figures on the fountain of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] were also by him. The Augustine monastery at [[Salamanca]] contains the tomb of the count and countess de Monterey, another work by Algardi.

==Relief of ''Fuga d'Attila'' in St. Peter's Basilica==
Algardi's masterpiece is the large dramatic marble high-relief panel of Pope Leo and Attila [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/a/algardi/2/meeting.html (image)](1646&amp;ndash;53) for [[St Peter's Basilica]], which reinvigorated the use of marble in reliefs. There had been large marble reliefs used previously, for example Gianlorenzo's father, [[Pietro Bernini]]'s crowded ''Assumption of the Virgin'' for [[Santa Maria Maggiore]](1606); but for most patrons, it was far too costly to use sculpted marble for such a large display as an altarpiece. In this relief, the two theatrically contrasted principal figures, the stern and courageous pope and the dismayed and frightened Attila, surge and protrude from the center. Only these two see the descending angelic warriers rallying to the pope's defense, while all others persist in the background reliefs, peforming respective earthly duties. The subject was apt for a papal state seeking  clout, since it depicts the legendary moment when the greatest of Pope Leos, with supernatural aide, had deterred the Huns from looting Rome. From a baroque standpoint it is a moment of divine intervention in the affairs of man. Algardi's patron Leo XI hoped all viewers would be sternly reminded of the papal capacity to invoke divine retribution against enemies. Algardi died within a year of completing his famous relief, which was admired by contemporaries.

==Critical Assessment and Legacy==    
Algardi was also known for his portraiture which shows an obsessive attention to details of psychologically revealing physiognomy in a sober but immediate naturalism, and minute attention to costume and draperies, such as in the busts of Laudivio Zacchia, Camillo Pamphilj, and Muzio Frangipane and his two sons Lello and Roberto [http://www.romeartlover.it/Algardi.html]. There is also a bronze statue of Innocent X for the ''Palazzo dei Conservatori'' in the [[Campidoglio]]. In St. Peter's Basilica, Algardi was also responsible for the prominent tomb of [[Leo XI]] (completed 1644). In temperament, his style was more akin to the classicized and restrained [[Baroque]] of [[François Duquesnoy]] than to the emotive works of Bernini. From an artistic point of view, he was most successful in portrait-statues and groups of children, where he was obliged to follow nature most closely. His terracotta models, some of them finished works of art, were prized by connoisseur collectors: an outstanding series of them is at the [[Hermitage Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]]. 

In his later years Algardi controlled a large studio and amassed a great fortune. His students (including [[Ercole Ferrata]] and [[Domenico Guidi]]) and their followers carried forward their versions of  Algardi's classicizing bravura manner well into the 18th century.
The latter two sudents completed his altarpiece at ''Vision of Saint Nicholas'' (San Nicola de Tolentino, Rome) using two separate marble pieces linked together in one event and place, yet successfully separating the divine and earthly spheres.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alger of Liège''' ([[1055]]-[[1131]]), known also as Alger of Cluny and Algerus Magister, a learned [[France|French]] [[priest]] who lived in the first half of the [[12th century]].

He was first a [[deacon]] of the church of St Bartholomew at [[Liège (city)|Liège]], his native town, and was then appointed (c. 1100) to the cathedral church of [[Saint Lambert (martyr)|Saint Lambert]]. He declined many offers from German bishops and finally retired to the monastery of [[Cluny]], where he died  at great age and leaving a good reputation for piety and intelligence.

His History of the Church of Liège, and many of his other works, are lost. The most important of those still extant are: 1. ''De Misericordia et Justitia'', a collection of biblical and patristic extracts with a commentary (an important work for the history of church law and discipline), which is to be found in the Anecdota of Martene, vol. v. 2. ''De Sacramentis Corporis et Sanguinis Domini''; a treatise, in three books, against the Berengarian heresy, highly commended by [[Peter of Cluny]] and 
[[Erasmus]]. 3. ''De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio''; given in B. Pez's ''Anecdota'', vol. iv. 4. ''De Sacrificio Missae''; given in the ''Collectio Scriptor. Vet.'' of Angelo Mai, vol. ix. p. 371.

'''Algiers''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''ولاية الجزائر''') ''El-Jazair'', The Islands) is the capital and largest city of [[Algeria]] in [[North Africa]]. According to the [[1998]] census, the population of the city proper was 1,519,570 whilst the total for the [[agglomeration]] was 2,135,630. Nicknamed ''El-Bahdja'' (البهجة) or ''Alger la Blanche'' (&quot;Algiers the White&quot;) for the glistening white of its buildings as seen sloping up from the sea, it is situated on the west side of a bay of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The city name is derived from its location on the slopes of the &quot;[[Sahel]]&quot;, a chain of hills parallel to the coast. Its geographical co-ordinates are: {{coor dm|36|47|N|3|4|E|}}.

The modern part of the city is built on the level ground by the seashore and the old part, the ancient city of the [[dey]]s, climbs the steep hill behind the modern town and is crowned by the [[casbah]] or citadel, 400 feet above the sea.  The casbah and the two quays form a triangle.

==History==
[[Image:Algiers CNE-v1-p58-J.jpg|thumb|300px|right|City and harbour of Algiers, circa 1921]]

A [[Phoenicia|Phoenician]] commercial outpost called ''Ikosim'', turned into a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] small town called [[Icosium]], existed on what is now the marine quarter of the city. The ''rue de la Marine'' follows the lines of a Roman street. Roman cemeteries existed near ''[[Bab-el-Oued]]'' and ''[[Bab Azoun]]''. The city was given [[Latin]] rights by [[Vespasian]]. The [[bishop]]s of Icosium are mentioned as late as the [[5th century]].

The present city was founded in [[944]] by [[Buluggin ibn Ziri]], the founder of the [[Zirid]]-[[Senhaja]] dynasty, which was overthrown by [[Roger II of Sicily]] in [[1148]]. The [[Zirid]]s had before that date lost Algiers, which in [[1159]] was occupied by the [[Almohades]], and in the [[13th century]] came under the dominion of the Abd-el-Wadid sultans of [[Tlemcen]].

Nominally part of the sultanate of [[Tlemcen]], Algiers had a large measure of independence under [[amir]]s of its own, [[Oran]] being the chief seaport of the Abd-el-Wahid. The islet in front of the harbour, subsequently known as the Penon, had been occupied by the Spaniards as early as [[1302]]. Thereafter a considerable trade grew up between Algiers and [[Spain]]. 

Algiers, however, continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the expulsion from Spain of the [[Moors]], many of whom sought an asylum in the city. In [[1510]], following their occupation of Oran and other towns on the coast of [[Africa]], the Spaniards fortified the Penon. In [[1516]] the amir of Algiers, Selim b. Teumi, invited the brothers Arouj and Khair-ad-Din ([[Khair ad Din|Barbarossa]]) to expel the Spaniards. Arouj came to Algiers, caused Selim to be assassinated, and seized the town. Khair-ad-Din, succeeding Arouj, drove the Spaniards from the Penon ([[1550]]) and was the founder of the ''pashalik'', afterwards ''deylik'', of Algeria.

[[Image:Sm Bombardment of Algiers, August 1816-Luny.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The bombardment of Algiers by Lord Exmouth, August 1816, painted by Thomas Luny]]

Algiers from this time became the chief seat of the [[Barbary pirates]]. In October [[1541]] the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] sought to capture the city, but a storm destroyed a great number of his ships, and his army of some 30,000, chiefly Spaniards, was defeated by the Algerians under their [[pasha]], Hassan. From the 17th century, Algiers, free of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control and sited on the periphery of both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, turned to piracy and ransoming. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Cornwall. The [[United States]] fought two wars (The [[First Barabary War|First]] and [[Second Barabary War|Second]] [[Barbary Wars]]) over Algiers' attacks on shipping. 

In [[1816]] the city was bombarded by a British squadron under [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]] (a descendant of Thomas Pellew, taken in an Algierian slave raid in [[1715]]), assisted by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] men-of-war, and the corsair fleet burned. On the 4th of July in [[1830]], on the pretext of an affront to their consul - whom the [[dey]] had hit with a fly-whisk when he said the French government was not prepared to pay its large outstanding debts to two Algerian Jewish merchants - a French army under [[Louis-Auguste-Victor, Count de Ghaisnes de Bourmont|General de Bourmont]] attacked the city, which capitulated on the following day.

The history of Algiers from [[1830]] to [[1962]] is bound to the larger history of [[Algeria]] and its relationship to [[France]].

In [[1962]], after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands of Algerians died (a million according to official Algerian history) at the hands of the French army and the Algerian [[Front de Libération Nationale]], Algeria finally gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire European or [[Pied-noir]] population, the city has expanded massively - it now has 3 million inhabitants, or 10% of Algeria's population - and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding [[Metidja]] plain.

== Local architecture ==

There are many public buildings of interest, including the whole [[casbah]] quarter, Martyrs Square (''Sahat ech-Chouhada'' ساحة الشهداء), the government offices (formerly the [[United Kingdom|British]] consulate), the &quot;Grand&quot;, &quot;New&quot;, and Ketchaoua [[Mosque]]s, the [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral of [[Notre Dame d'Afrique]], the [[Bardo Museum]] (a former Turkish mansion), the old ''Bibliotheque Nationale d'Alger'' - a [[Turkey|Turkish]] palace built in [[1799]]-[[1800]] - and the new National Library, built in a style reminiscent of the [[British Library]].

The main building in the [[casbah]] was begun in [[1516]] on the site of an older building, and served as the palace of the deys until the [[France|French]] conquest. A road has been cut through the centre of the building, the mosque turned into [[barracks]], and the hall of audience allowed to fall into ruin. There still remain a [[minaret]] and some marble arches and columns. Traces exist of the vaults in which were stored the treasures of the dey.

The Grand Mosque (''Jamaa-el-Kebir'' الجامع الكبير) is traditionally said to be the oldest mosque in Algiers. The pulpit (''[[minbar]]'' منبر) bears an inscription showing that the building existed in [[1018]]. The minaret was built by [[Abu Tachfin]], sultan of [[Tlemcen]], in [[1324]]. The interior of the mosque is square and is divided into aisles by columns joined by [[Moors|Moorish]] arches.
[[Image:New Mosque (Jamaa el-Jedid) in Algiers 04968r.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The New Mosque (Jamaa el-Jedid) in Algiers - late 1800's]]
[[Image:bfc_algiers_synagogue_02_02w.jpg|frame|Algiers. Stone synagogue. Photo early 1900's.
[http://www.bfcollection.net/cities/algeria/algiers.html Boris Feldblyum Collection]]]

The New Mosque (''Jamaa-el-Jedid'' الجامع الجديد), dating from the [[17th century]], is in the form of a [[Greek cross]], surmounted by a large white cupola, with four small cupolas at the corners. The minaret is 90 ft. high. The interior resembles that of the Grand Mosque.

The church of the Holy Trinity (built in [[1870]]) stands at the southern end of the ''rue d'Isly'' near the site of the demolished Fort Bab Azoun باب عزون. The interior is richly decorated with various coloured marbles. Many of these marbles contain memorial inscriptions relating to the English residents (voluntary and involuntary) of Algiers from the time of John Tipton, British consul in [[1580]]. One tablet records that in [[1631]] two Algerine pirate crews landed in [[Ireland]], sacked [[Baltimore, County Cork|Baltimore]], and carried off its inhabitants to slavery; another recalls the romantic escape of Ida M`Donnell, daughter of Admiral Ulric, consul-general of [[Denmark]], and wife of the British consul.  When Lord Exmouth was about to bombard the city in [[1816]], the British consul was thrown into prison and loaded with chains. Mrs M`Donnell - who was but sixteen - escaped to the British fleet disguised as a midshipman, carrying a basket of vegetables in which her baby was hidden. (Mrs M`Donnell subsequently married the duc de Talleyrand-Perigord and died at [[Florence]] in [[1880]]). Among later residents commemorated is Edward Lloyd, who was the first person to show the value of [[esparto]] grass for the manufacture of paper, and thus started an industry which is one of the most important in Algeria.

The Ketchaoua mosque (''Djamaa Ketchaoua'' جامع كتشاوة), at the foot of the Casbah, was before independence in [[1962]] the cathedral of St Philippe, itself made in [[1845]] from a mosque dating from 1612. The principal entrance, reached by a flight of 23 steps, is ornamented with a [[portico]] supported by four black-veined marble columns. The roof of the nave is of [[Moorish Empire|Moorish]] [[plaster]] work. It rests on a series of arcades supported by white marble columns. Several of these columns belonged to the original mosque. In one of the chapels was a tomb containing the bones of [[San Geronimo]]. The building seems a curious blend of Moorish and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] styles.

Algiers possesses a college with schools of law, medicine, science and letters. The college buildings are large and handsome. The [[Bardo]] museum holds some of the ancient sculptures and mosaics discovered in Algeria, together with medals and Algerian money.

The port of Algiers is sheltered from all winds. There are two harbours, both artificial - the old or northern harbour and the southern or Agha harbour. The northern harbour covers an area of 235 acres (950,000 m&amp;sup2;). An opening in the south [[jetty]] affords an entrance into Agha harbour, constructed in Agha Bay. Agha harbour has also an independent entrance on its southern side.

The inner harbour was begun in [[1518]] by Khair-ad-Din [[Khair ad Din|Barbarossa]] (see History, below), who, to accommodate his pirate vessels, caused the island on which was Fort Penon to be connected with the mainland by a [[mole (architecture)|mole]]. The lighthouse which occupies the site of Fort Penon was built in [[1544]].

Algiers was a walled city from the time of the deys until the close of the 19th century. The French, after their occupation of the city ([[1830]]), built a [[rampart]], [[parapet]] and [[ditch]], with two terminal forts, [[Bab Azoun]] باب عزون to the south and [[Bab-el-Oued]] باب الواد to the north. The forts and part of the ramparts were demolished at the beginning of the [[20th century]], when a line of forts occupying the heights of [[Bouzareah]] بوزريعة (at an elevation of 1300 ft. above the sea) took their place.

Notre-Dame d'Afrique, a church built ([[1858]]-[[1872]]) in a mixture of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] styles, is conspicuously situated, overlooking the sea, on the shoulder of the [[Bouzareah]] hills, 2 m. to the north of the city. Above the altar is a statue of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin]] depicted as a black woman. The church also contains a solid silver statue of the [[archangel Michael]], belonging to the confraternity of [[Naples|Neapolitan]] fishermen.

Villa Abd-el-Tif, former residence of the [[dey]], was used during the French period, to accommodate French artists, chiefly painters, and winners of the [[Abd-el-Tif prize]], for a while of two years. Nowadays, Algerian artists are back in the villa's studios.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alhazen Abu Ali al-Hasan Ibn Al-Haitham''' (also: '''Ibn al Haythen''') ([[965]]-[[1040]]) ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: أبو علي الحسن بن الهيثم) was an [[Arabian]] [[mathematician]]; he is sometimes called '''al-Basri''' (Arabic: البصري), after his birthplace [[Basrah]], [[Iraq]].

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Alhazen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait of Alhazen]] --&gt;

==Life==
Alhazen was born at [[Basra]], then part of the Islamic(Abbasid) [[Caliphate]], now part of [[Iraq]] (See [http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Al-Haytham.html] and [http://www.answers.com/topic/alhazen]), and probably died in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. 

One account of his career has him summoned to [[Egypt]] by the mercurial [[caliph]] [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Hakim]] to regulate the [[flooding]] of the [[Nile]]. After his field work made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme, and fearing the caliph's anger, he [[feigned madness]]. He was kept under house arrest until Hakim's death in [[1021]]. During this time he wrote scores of important mathematical treatises.

Abu Ali Hasan Ibn al-Haitham was one of the most eminent physicists, whose contributions to optics and the scientific methods are outstanding. Known in the West as Alhazen, Ibn aI-Hautham was born in [[965]] A. D. in [[Basrah]], and was educated in Basrah and [[Baghdad]]. Thereafter, he went to Egypt, where he was asked to find ways of controlling the flood of the [[Nile]]. Being unsuccessful in this, he feigned madness until the death of [[Caliph]] al-Hakim. He also traveled to [[Spain]] and, during this period, he had ample time for his scientific pursuits, which included optics, mathematics, physics, medicine and development of scientific methods on each of which he has left several outstanding books. 

He made a thorough examination of the passage of light through various media and discovered the laws of [[refraction]]. He also carried out the first experiments on the dispersion of light into its constituent [[colors]]. His book Kitab-at-Manazir was translated into [[Latin]] in the [[Middle Ages]], as also his book dealing with the colors of sunset. He dealt at length with the theory of various physical phenomena like [[shadows]], [[eclipse]]s, the [[rainbow]], and speculated on the physical nature of light. He is the first to describe accurately the various parts of the [[eye]] and give a scientific explanation of the process of [[visual perception|vision]]. He also attempted to explain [[binocular vision]], and gave a correct explanation of the apparent increase in size of the [[sun]] and the [[moon]] when near the horizon. He is known for the earliest use of the [[camera obscura]]. He contradicted [[Ptolemy]]'s and [[Euclid]]'s theory of vision that objects are seen by rays of light emanating from the eyes; according to him the rays originate in the object of vision and not in the eye. Through these extensive researches on optics, he has been considered as the [[List_of_people_known_as_the_father_or_mother_of_something|father of modern optics]]. 

The Latin translation of his main work, Kitab-at-Manazir, exerted a great influence upon Western science e.g. on the work of [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. It brought about a great progress in experimental methods. His research in [[catoptrics]] centered on spherical and parabolic mirrors and spherical aberration. He made the important observation that the ratio between the [[angle of incidence]] and [[refraction]] does not remain constant and investigated the [[magnification|magnifying]] power of a [[lens (optics)|lens]]. His catoptrics contain the important problem known as [[Alhazen's problem]]. It comprises drawing lines from two points in the plane of a circle meeting at a point on the [[circumference]] and making equal angles with the normal at that point. This leads to an equation of the fourth degree. 

In his book Mizan al-Hikmah Ibn al-Haitham has discussed the [[density]] of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and developed a relation between it and the height. He also studied atmospheric refraction. He discovered that the [[twilight]] only ceases or begins when the sun is 19° below the horizon and attempted to measure the height of the atmosphere on that basis. He has also discussed the theories of attraction between [[mass|masses]], and it seems that he was aware of the magnitude of acceleration due to [[gravity]]. 

His contribution to mathematics and physics was extensive. In mathematics, he developed analytical [[geometry]] by establishing linkage between [[algebra]] and geometry. He studied the mechanics of motion of a body and was the first to maintain that a body moves [[perpetual motion|perpetually]] unless an external force stops it or changes its direction of motion. This would seem equivalent to the [[first law of motion]]. 

The list of his books runs to 200 or so, very few of which have survived. Even his monumental treatise on optics survived through its Latin translation. During the Middle Ages his books on [[cosmology]] were translated into Latin, [[Hebrew language|
Hebrew]] and other languages. He has also written on the subject of [[evolution]] a book that deserves serious attention even today. 

In his writing, one can see a clear development of the scientific methods as developed and applied by the Muslims and comprising the systematic observation of physical phenomena and their linking together into a scientific theory. This was a major breakthrough in scientific methodology, as distinct from guess and gesture, and placed scientific pursuits on a sound foundation comprising systematic relationship between observation, [[hypothesis]] and verification. 

Ibn al-Haitham's influence on physical sciences in general, and optics in particular, has been held in high esteem and, in fact, it ushered in a new era in optical research, both in theory and practice.

Alhazen is also featured on the obverse of the Iraqi 10,000 Dinars banknote issued in 2003.

==Works==
Alhazen was a pioneer in [[optics]], [[engineering]] and [[astronomy]]. According to [[Giambattista della Porta]], Alhazen was the first to explain the apparent increase in the size of the moon and sun when near the horizon, although [[Roger Bacon]] gives the credit of this discovery to [[Ptolemy]]. Alhazen also taught that vision does not result from the emission of rays from the eye, and wrote on the [[refraction]] of light, especially on atmospheric refraction, for example, the cause of morning and evening twilight. He solved the problem of finding the point on a [[convex]] [[mirror]] at which a ray coming from one point is reflected to another point.

Alhazen's extensive writings influenced many Western intellectuals such as Roger Bacon, [[John Pecham]], [[Witelo]], and [[Johannes Kepler]].

===''Optics''===

His seven volume treatise on optics ''Kitab al-Manazir'' (''Book of Optics'') (written from [[1015]] to [[1021]]) is possibly the earliest work to use the [[scientific method]]. The ancient Greeks believed that truth was determined by the logic and beauty of reasoning; experiment was used as a demonstration. Alhazen used the results of experiments to test theories. The &quot;emission&quot; theory of light had been supported by [[Euclid]] and Ptolemy. This theory postulated that sight worked by the eye emitting light. The second or &quot;intromission&quot; theory, supported by [[Aristotle]] had light entering the eye. Alhazen performed experiments to determine that the &quot;intromission&quot; theory was scientifically correct.

''Optics'' was translated into Latin by [[Witelo]] in [[1270]]. It was published by [[Friedrich Risner]] in [[1572]], with the title ''Oticae thesaurus Alhazeni libri VII., cum ejusdem libro de crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus.'' This work enjoyed a great reputation during the [[Middle Ages]]. Works by Alhazen on geometrical subjects were discovered in the [[Bibliothèque nationale]] in [[Paris]] in [[1834]] by E. A. Sedillot. Other manuscripts are preserved in the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]] and in the library of [[Leiden]].

==Other Alhazens==
There is another Alhazen who translated [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' in the 10th century.

'''Alessandro di Cristofano di Lorenzo del Bronzino Allori''' ([[May 31]], [[1535]] - [[September 22]], [[1607]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] portrait [[painter]] of the late [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] [[Florence|Florentine]] school. He was brought up and trained in art by his uncle, [[Angelo Bronzino]], whose name he sometimes assumed in his pictures. Freedburg derides Allori as derivative, claiming  he illustrates &quot;the ideal of Maniera by which art (and style) are generated out of pre-existing art.&quot; The polish of figures has an unnatural marble-like form as if he aimed for cold statuary. Collaborators include [[Giovanni Maria Butteri]], main pupil: [[Giovanni Bizzelli]].

He is the father of [[Cristofano Allori]] ([[1577]]-[[1621]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Almoravides''' (In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] المرابطون ''al-Murabitun'', sing. مرابط ''Murabit''), is a [[Berber]] dynasty from the [[Sahara]] which, in the [[11th century]], founded the fourth dynasty in [[Morocco]]. Under this dynasty the [[Moorish]] empire was extended over [[Tlemcen]] (in modern [[Algeria]]) and a great part of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]].  The name is derived from the Arabic ''Murabit'', variously translated as ''religious ascetic'' or ''warrior monk''.

== Beginnings ==
The most powerful of the invading tribes was the [[Lamtuna]] (&quot;veiled men&quot;) from the upper [[Niger River]], whose best-known representatives now are the [[Tuareg]].  They had been converted to [[Islam]] in the early times of the Arab conquest, but their knowledge of Islam did not go much beyond the formula of the [[shahada]] creed---&quot;there is no god but God, and Muhammad is the apostle of God,&quot;--and they were ignorant of the traditions of [[Shariah]], or Islamic law.

== Influence of orthodox Islam ==
About the year 1040 (or a little earlier) one of their chiefs, [[Yahya ibn Ibrahim]], made the [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]].  On his way home, he attended the teachers of the mosque at [[Kairouan]], in [[Tunisia]], who soon learnt from him that his people knew little of the religion they were supposed to profess, and that though his will was good, his own ignorance was great.  By the good offices of the theologians of Kairawan, one of whom was from [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], Yahya was provided with a missionary, [[Abd Allah ibn Yasin]], a zealous partisan of the [[Maliki]]s, one of the four [[Four Schools of Madhhab|Madhhab]]; orthodox legal schools of Islam.

His preaching was before-long rejected by the Lamtunas; so  on the advice of Yahya, who accompanied him, he retired to an island in the [[Niger River]], where he founded a ''[[ribat]]'', or Islamic monastery, from which as a centre his influence spread.  There was no element of [[heresy]] in his creed, which was mainly distinguished by a rigid formalism, and strict obedience to the letter of the [[Qur'an]], and the orthodox tradition or [[Sunnah]].

== Ascendence of Militarism ==
Abd-Allah ibn Yasin imposed a penitential scourging on all converts as a purification, and enforced a regular system of discipline for every breach of the law; even on the chiefs.  Under such directions, the Murabits were brought into excellent order.  Their first military leader, Yahya ibn Ibrahim, gave them a good military organization.  Their main force was infantry, armed with javelins in the front ranks and pikes behind, which formed into a phalanx; and was supported by camelmen and horsemen on the flanks.

== Military Successes ==
From the year [[1053]], the Murabits began to impose their orthodox and puritanical religion on the [[Berber]] tribes of the desert, and on the pagan black Africans. Yahya ibn Ibrahim was killed in a battle in [[1056]], but Abd-Allah ibn Yasin, whose influence as a religious teacher was paramount; named his brother [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar]] as chief.  Under him, the Murabits soon began to spread their power beyond the desert, and subjected the tribes of the [[Atlas Mountains]].  They then came in contact with the [[Berghouata]], a [[Berber]] people of central [[Morocco]], who followed a &quot;heresy&quot; founded by [[Salih ibn Tarif]], three centuries earlier.  The Berghouata made a fierce resistance, and it was in battle with them that Abdullah ibn Yasin was killed. They were, however, completely conquered by Abu Bakr Ibn-Umar, who took the defeated chief's widow, [[Zainab]], as a wife.

In 1061, Abu Bakr Ibn-Umar made a division of the power he had established, handing over the more-settled parts to his cousin [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], as viceroy; resigning to him also his favourite wife Zainab, who had the reputation of being a sorceress.  For himself, he reserved the task of suppressing the revolts which had broken out in the desert, but when he returned to resume control, he found his cousin too powerful to be superseded; so he had to go back to the Sahara, where-in [[1087]], he too attained martyrdom, having been wounded with a poisoned arrow, in battle with the pagan black Africans.

=== Morocco and Western Sahara ===
Yusuf ibn Tashfin had in the meantime brought what is now known as [[Morocco]] and the [[Western Sahara]] into complete subjection; and in [[1062]], had founded the city of [[Marrakech]]. In [[1080]], he conquered the kingdom of [[Tlemcen]] (in modern-day [[Algeria]]) and founded the present city of that name, his rule extending as far east as [[Oran]].

=== Ghana ===
In [[1075]], the Almoravides declared &quot;[[jihad]]&quot; (&quot;holy struggle&quot;) on the [[Kingdom of Ghana]]. The ensuing war pushed Ghana over the edge: ceasing the kingdom's position as a commercial and military power by [[1100]], as it collapsed into tribal groups and chieftaincies, some of which later assimilated into the Almoravides.

=== Spain ===
[[Image:Almoravid map reconquest loc.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of Iberia at the time of the Almoravid arrival]]
In [[1086]] Yusuf ibn Tashfin was invited by the Muslim princes in [[Spain]] to defend them against [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]], King of [[Castile]] and [[Kingdom of León|León]]. In that year, Yusuf ibn Tashfin passed the straits to [[Algeciras]], inflicted a severe defeat on the Christians at the [[Battle of az-Zallaqah|az-Zallaqah]]. He was prevented from following up his victory by trouble in [[Africa]], which he had to settle in person.  

When he returned to Spain in [[1090]], it was avowedly for the purpose of deposing the Muslim princes, and annexing their states. He had in his favour the mass of the inhabitants, whom had been worn out by the oppressive taxation imposed by their spend-thrift rulers. Their religious teachers, as well as others in the east, (most notably, [[al-Ghazali]] in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[al-Tartushi]] in Egypt, who was himself a Spaniard by birth, from [[Tortosa]]), detested the native Muslim princes for their religious indifference, and gave Yusuf a ''[[fatwa]]'' -- or legal opinion -- to the effect that he had good moral and religious right, to dethrone the heterodox rulers, who did not scruple to seek help from the Christians, whose habits they had adopted. By 1094, he had removed them all; and though he regained little from the Christians except [[Valencia]], he re-united the Muslim power, and gave a check to the reconquest of the country by the Christians.

=== The Prince of the Muslims ===
After friendly correspondence with the caliph at [[Baghdad]], whom he acknowledged as ''Amir al-Mu'minin'' (''Prince of the Faithful''), Yusuf ibn Tashfin in [[1097]] assumed the title of ''Amir al Muslimin'' (''Prince of the Muslims''). He died in [[1106]], when he was reputed to have reached the age of 100.

The Murabit power was at its height at Yusuf's death, and the Moorish empire then included all North-West Africa as far as [[Algiers]], and all Spain south of the [[Tagus]], with the east coast as far as the mouth of the [[Ebro]], and included the [[Balearic Islands]].

== Decline ==
Three years afterwards, under Yusef's son and successor, [[Ali ibn Yusuf]], [[Madrid]], [[Lisbon]] and [[Oporto]] were added, and Spain was again invaded in [[1119]] and [[1121]], but the tide had turned; the French having assisted the Aragonese to recover [[Zaragoza]].  In 1138, Ali ibn Yusuf was defeated by [[Alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII of Castile and León]], and in the [[Battle of Ourique]] ([[1139]]), by [[Afonso I of Portugal]], who thereby won his crown; and [[Lisbon]] was recovered by the Portuguese in [[1147]].

Ali ibn Yusuf was a pious non-entity, who fasted and prayed while his empire fell to pieces under the combined action of his Christian foes in [[Spain]] and the agitation of [[Almohades]] (the Muwahhids) in Morocco. After Ali ibn Yusuf's death in [[1142]], his son Tashfin ibn Ali lost ground rapidly before the Almohades, and in 1146 he was killed by a fall from a precipice, while endeavouring to escape after a defeat near [[Oran]].  

His two successors [[Ibrahim ibn Tashfin]] and [[Is'haq ibn Ali]] are mere names. The conquest of the city of Marrakesh by the [[Almohades]] in [[1147]] marked the fall of the dynasty, though fragments of the [[Almoravides]] (the [[Banu Ghanya]]), continued to struggle in the [[Balearic Islands]], and finally in [[Tunisia]].

The amirs of the Almoravides dynasty were as follows:---
*[[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] (1061-1106)
*[[Ali ibn Yusuf]] (1106-1142)
*[[Tashfin ibn Ali]] (1142-1146)
*[[Ibrahim ibn Tashfin]] (1146)
*[[Ishaq ibn Ali]] (1146-1147)

'''Aloe''' is a [[genus]] of [[succulent plant|succulent]], [[flowering plant]]s in the family [[Asphodelaceae]], which contains about 400 different [[species]]. They are native to the drier parts of [[Africa]], especially [[South Africa]]'s [[Cape Province]] and the mountains of tropical Africa. 

Members of the closely allied genera ''[[Gasteria]]'' and ''[[Haworthia]]'', which have a similar mode of growth, are also sometimes popularly known as aloes. Note that the plant sometimes called &quot;American aloe&quot;, ''Agave americana'', belongs to a different family, namely [[Agavaceae]].  

Aloe plants are stiff and rugged, consisting mainly of a rosette of large, thick, fleshy [[Leaf|leaves]].  Many common varieties of Aloe are seemingly stemless, with the rosette growing directly at ground level;  Other varieties may have a branched or un-branched [[plant stem|stem]] from which the fleshy leaves spring.  The leaves are generally lance-shaped with a sharp apex and a spiny margin.  They vary in color from grey to bright green and are sometimes striped or mottled.  

Aloe [[flower]]s are small, tubular, and yellow or red and are borne on densely clustered, simple or branched leafless stems.  The plants are cultivated as ornamental plants, especially in public buildings and gardens.

==Uses==
Human use of Aloes are primarily as a [[Herbalism|herbal remedy]] in alternative medicines and &quot;home first aid&quot;. Both the translucent inner pulp as well as the resinous yellow exudate from wounding the Aloe plant are used ''externally'' to relieve skin discomforts and ''internally'' as purgatives. To date, research has shown in certain cases that Aloes produce positive medicinal benefits for healing damaged skin, however there is still much debate regarding the effectiveness and safety for using Aloes medicinally in other manners{{citeneeded}}.

Some Aloes have been used for human consumption. For example drinks made from or containing chunks of aloe pulp are popular in Asia as commercial beverages, and as a tea additive. This is notably true in [[Korea]]. As well, the yellow exudate from the leaves were once used on children's fingers to stop nail-biting.

===External uses===
[[Image:Aloe vera leaf.jpg|thumb|Leaf close up]]

The most common uses of aloe vera have been from topical use on human skin to treat various conditions. Aloe vera is also often used to treat skin from burns. Not only does it soothe the skin, ease pain and reduce inflammation, studies have been done to show that using aloe as a topical treatment to burns will help speed up the healing recovery process.  A study performed in the 1990s showed that the healing of a moderate severe burn was sped up by six days when covering the wound on a regular basis with aloe vera gel, compared to the healing of the wound covered in a gauze bandage (Farrar, 2005).  Aloe vera not only helps burns of various degrees, it also has become a common relief aid in treating sunburns.  Aloe vera be found in drugstores in a gel form.  When rubbed over over-exposed skin, the redness will disappear within a couple of days and helps to preserve moisture so that the skin will not become dry and peel.

Aloe vera can also be used to treat minor cuts and scrapes.  Using an aloe vera leaf and rubbing it over a cut will help prevent infection and will speed up the healing response from the body.  The aloe vera acts as a sealant and pulls the skin back together like a bandage or a suture (http://www.newstarget.com/001560-02.html).  Although aloe should not be used as a substitute for medical treatment, its many uses are beneficial and should be considered for anything such as an everyday moisturizer to a first-aid antiseptic.  In addition to the above-mentioned benefits, continuous research is being done to learn how else the aloe vera plant can play an important part in human lives.

Many cosmetic companies are now adding this plant to every product possible including makeup, soaps, sunscreens, shampoos and lotions, as well as any product that is created to soothe, protect and moisturize the skin. This is due partially to the fact that Aloe extract is full of vitamins, nutrients and minerals, as well as, the perception of the general public of Aloe as a healing ingredient. The International Aloe Science Council advises choosing products that contain between twenty-five and forty percent aloe in them to receive the ultimate aloe vera benefits to the skin (http://www.iasc.org/aloe.html). 

Aloe gel is also useful for any dry skin condition, especially [[eczema]] around the eyes and sensitive facial skin, and for treating fungal infections such as ringworm. In [[Ayurvedic]] medicine, the gel is usually applied fresh and can even be converted into an ointment for long-term use.

=== Internal uses ===
[[Image:Aloevera1web.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Aloe vera (flowers)]]
Aloe contains a number of medicinal substances used as a [[purgative]].  The medicinal substance is produced from various species of aloe, such as ''A. vera'', ''A. vulgaris'', ''A. socotrina'', ''A. chinensis'', and ''A. perryi''.  Several kinds of aloes are commercially available: Barbadoes, Socotrine, Hepatic, Indian, and Cape aloes.  Barbadoes and Socotrine are the varieties most commonly used for curative purposes. 

Aloes is the expressed juice of the leaves of the plant.  When the leaves are cut, the juice that flows out is collected and evaporated.  After the juice has been removed, the leaves are sometimes boiled, to yield an inferior kind of aloes. The juice of the leaves of certain species, e.g. ''Aloe venenosa'', is [[poison]]ous.

Aloe vera has been widely marketed as having a number of benefits when taken internally. For example, Aloe has been marketed as a remedy for coughs, wounds, [[ulcer]]s, [[gastritis]], [[diabetes]], [[cancer]], [[headache]]s, [[arthritis]], [[immune-system deficiencies]], and many other conditions.  However, these uses are unproven.  The only substantiated internal use is as a [[laxative]].  Furthermore, there is evidence of significant adverse side effects (see for example [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15633238 this paper]).  Consult your doctor when contemplating taking Aloe internally. Avoid use during pregnancy because the [[anthraquinone]] [[glycoside]]s are strongly [[purgative]]. High doses of the leaves can cause vomiting.

Aloe's benefits include ingesting aloe juice to lower blood sugar levels in diabetes patients.{{citeneeded}}

== Compounds in Aloes ==
Aloe vera contains over seventy-five nutrients and twenty minerals, nineteen amino acids including all eight essential amino acids and eleven secondary amino acids as well and twelve vitamins.  These vitamins include:  A, B1, B6, B12, C and E (http://curezone.com/foods/aloevera.html).  It has even been referred to as “a pharmacy in a plant” (Farrar, 2005). 

Aloes also contain [[anthraquinone gycoside]]s, [[resin]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, [[sterol]]s, [[gelonin]]s, and [[chromone]]s. It is also a source of a class of chemicals called ''Aloin''s.

=== Chemical properties of Aloin ===
[[Image:Split Aloe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Split Aloe]]
Aloins are soluble and easily extracted by water. Aloes is the expressed juice of the leaves of the plant.  When the leaves are cut, the juice that flows out is collected and evaporated.  After the juice has been removed, the leaves are sometimes boiled, to yield an inferior kind of aloes. According to W. A. Shenstone, two classes of Aloins are to be recognized: (1) [[nataloin]]s, which yield [[picric acid|picric]] and [[oxalic acid]]s with [[nitric acid]], and do not give a red coloration with nitric acid; and (2) [[barbaloin]]s, which yield [[aloetic acid]] (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chrysammic acid]] (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, being reddened by the acid. This second group may be divided into a-barbaloins, obtained from Barbadoes aloes, and reddened in the cold, and b-barbaloins, obtained from Socotrine and Zanzibar aloes, reddened by ordinary nitric acid only when warmed or by fuming acid in the cold. Nataloin (2C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) forms bright yellow scales. Barbaloin (C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) forms yellow [[Prism (geometry)|prism]]atic crystals. Aloes also contain a trace of volatile oil, to which its odour is due.

=== Medicinal use of Aloin ===
The dose is 130-320 mg, that of aloin being 30-130 mg.  Aloes can be absorbed from a broken surface and will then cause purging. When given internally it increases the actual amount as well as the rate of flow of the [[bile]]. It hardly affects the [[small intestine]], but markedly stimulates the muscular coat of the [[large intestine]], causing purging in about fifteen hours. There is hardly any increase in the intestinal secretion, the drug being emphatically not a hydragogue cathartic. There is no doubt that its habitual use may be a factor in the formation of haemorrhoids; as in the case of all drugs that act powerfully on the lower part of the intestine, without simultaneously lowering the venous pressure by causing increase of secretion from the bowel. Aloes also tends to increase the menstrual flow and therefore belongs to the group of emmenagogues. Aloin is preferable to aloes for therapeutic purposes, as it causes less, if any, pain. It is a valuable drug in many forms of constipation, as its continual use does not, as a rule, lead to the necessity of enlarging the dose. Its combined action on the bowel and the [[uterus]] is of especial value in chlorosis, of which amenorrhoea is an almost constant symptom. The drug is obviously contraindicated in pregnancy and when haemorrhoids are already present. Many well-known patent medicines consist essentially of aloes.

== Lign-aloes and Agarwood ==
The lign-aloes are quite different from plants of the ''Aloe'' genus. The term &quot;Aloes&quot; is used in the [[Bible]] (Numbers 24:6), but as the trees usually supposed to be meant by this word are not native in [[Syria]], it has been suggested that the [[Septuagint]] reading in which the word does not occur is to be preferred. Lign-aloe is a corruption of the Latin ''lignum-aloe'', a wood, not a resin. [[Dioscorides]] refers to it as ''agallochon'', a wood brought from [[Arabia]] or [[India]], which was odoriferous but with an astringent and bitter taste. This may be ''[[Agarwood]]'', a native of East India, [[South East Asia]], and [[China]], which supplies the so-called eagle-wood or aloes-wood, which contains much resin and oil.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alyattes II''', king of [[Lydia]] ([[619 BC|619]]-[[560 BC]]), the real founder of the [[Lydian empire]], was the son of [[Sadyattes]], of the house of the [[Mermnadae]].  

For several years he continued the war against [[Miletus]] begun by his father, but was obliged to turn his attention to the [[Medes]] and [[Babylonians]]. On [[May 28]], [[585 BC]], during a battle on the [[Halys]] against [[Cyaxares]], king of Media, a [[solar eclipse]] took place (see also [[Thales]]); hostilities were suspended, peace concluded, and the Halys fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms.

Alyattes drove the [[Cimmeria|Cimmerii]] (see [[Scythia]]) from [[Asia]], subdued the [[Carians]], and took several [[Ionia]]n cities ([[Izmir|Smyrna]], [[Colophon]]).  ([[Izmir|Smyrna]] was sacked and destroyed c.[[600 BC]], the inhabitants forced to move to the country.)

He standardised the weight of coins (1 Stater = 168 grains of wheat). The coins were produced using an anvil die technique and stamped with the Lion's head, the symbol of the Mermnadae.

He was succeeded by his son [[Croesus]]. His daughter [[Aryenis of Lydia]] was [[Queen consort]] of [[Astyages]], King of Media.

His tomb still exists on the plateau between Lake Gygaea and the river Hermus to the north of [[Sardis]] -- a large mound of earth with a substructure of huge stones.  It was excavated by [[Spiegelthal]] in [[1854]], who found that it covered a large vault of finely-cut marble blocks approached by a flat-roofed passage of the same stone from the south.  The [[sarcophagus]] and its contents had been removed by early plunderers of the tomb, all that was left being some broken alabaster vases, pottery and charcoal. On the summit of the mound were large [[phallus|phalli]] of stone.

{{citation style}}

In [[criminal law]], the '''age of consent''' (AOC) is the age at which a person is considered to be capable of legally giving [[informed consent]] to any legal contract or behavior regulated by law, including [[sexual acts]] with another person. In most jurisdictions, the Age of Consent is violated when an adult has intercourse with an individual who has not reached that jurisdiction's AOC. In other jurisdictions, the AOC is a minimum age for any type of sexual conduct, and two minor participants can violate a jurisdiction's AOC. The crime and penalties for an AOC violation varies based on jurisdiction, the age of the older actor and the difference between the two actors. Charges may range from a relatively low level misdemeanor such as &quot;corruption of a minor&quot; to [[statutory rape]] (which is considered equivalent to rape, both in severity and sentencing.) Some jurisdictions have a second age of consent that is relevant in situations when the adult actor is in a position of authority over the minor (affecting teachers, coaches, principals, health professionals, police officers, family members.) Though some areas allow certain ages that can have sexual intercourse with someone over or under the age of consent but by only a few years (usually 3-4 years). 

The age of consent should not be confused with the [[age of majority]] or [[age of criminal responsibility]], and in some jurisdictions, the [[marriageable age]] differs from the age of consent.

The age of consent varies widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, though most jurisdictions in the world today have an age of consent between 14 to 18 years, but ages as young as 12 and as old as 21 also occur. The relevant age may also vary by the type of sexual act or the gender of the people concerned.

==Social and legal attitudes==
Social and legal attitudes towards the appropriate age of consent have drifted upwards in modern times; while ages from ten through to thirteen were typically acceptable in the mid 19th century, fifteen through eighteen had become the norm in many countries by the end of the 20th century. Calls for the age of consent for heterosexual sex to be lowered are largely unheard of outside of US, with a typical age of 14 to 18. 

Sexual relations with a person under the age of consent is in general a criminal offense, with punishments ranging from token fines to life imprisonment. In the [[United States]] this offense is frequently (but often inaccurately) called [[Statutory rape#Statutory rape|statutory rape]], though outside the United States other names are more commonly used (e.g. &quot;carnal knowledge of a person under sixteen years&quot;).

The enforcement practices of age of consent laws tend to vary depending on the social sensibilities of the particular culture. Often enforcement is not exercised to the letter of the law, with legal action being taken only when a sufficiently socially-unacceptable age gap exists between the two individuals, or if the perpetrator is in a position of authority over the minor (e.g. a teacher, priest or doctor). The [[sex]] of each participant also influences perceptions of an individual's guilt and therefore enforcement.  &quot;The Supreme Court has held that stricter rules for males do not violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution, on the theory that men lack the disincentives associated with pregnancy that women have to engage in sexual activity, and the law may thus provide men with those disincentives in the form of criminal sanctions.&quot; {{ref|posner}} Not only is enforcement more likely in the case of a larger age gap, but in the US at least, laws are becoming more explicit about prohibiting sex between youngsters and authority figures, even when sex would otherwise be legal.

That the relationship was consensual is not in general a defense to having sexual relations with a person under the age of consent; however, there are some defenses: common examples include a ''limited mistake of age defence'' and a ''defense of similarity of age''. A mistake of age defense is that the accused mistakenly believed the victim was not under the age of consent; however, where such a defense is provided, it is normally limited to apply only when the victim is above a certain age. Such a defense becomes stronger if the accused can show [[due diligence]] in determining the age of the victim.

A defense of similarity of age is that the difference in age between the accused and the victim was fewer than a certain number of years.
Another defense is often marriage, for those jurisdictions where the [[marriageable age]] is less than the age of consent.

===Extraterrioriality===
Increasingly the age of consent laws of a state apply not only to acts committed on its own territory, but also acts committed by its nationals and/or inhabitants on foreign territory. Such provisions have been frequently adopted to help reduce the incidence of child [[sex tourism]].

* In the [[United States]] the [[PROTECT Act of 2003]] (signed into law on April 30, 2003) authorizes fines and/or imprisonment for up to 30 years for US citizens or residents who engage in illicit sexual conduct abroad.  For the purposes of this law illicit sexual conduct includes commercial sex with anyone under 18, and all sex with anyone under 16.  Previous US law was less strict, only punishing those having sex either in contravention of local laws OR in commerce (prostitution); but did not prohibit non-commercial sex with, say, a 14 year-old if such sex is legal in the foreign territory.

* [[France]] allows the prosecution of its own citizens on rape charges for sex with minors under 15 abroad even if it was legal with respect to the local jurisdiction. The same applies to [[Germany]] if the minor is under 14.

* For inhabitants of the [[Netherlands]] it is a severe crime to have sex with a prostitute under the age of 18, or any person below 16, anywhere in the world. If a foreigner has had sex with someone under the age of 16 or a prostitute below 18—even if this was legal—and if this was done at a time that it was already illegal in the Netherlands, he or she becomes a criminal when immigrating to the Netherlands.

(See also [[Universal jurisdiction]]; the effective age of consent may be the highest of those corresponding to the list in [[Universal jurisdiction#Applicable jurisdictions|Applicable jurisdictions]].)

==Age of consent for homosexual and heterosexual sex==
Frequently, jurisdictions provide differing ages of consent for [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] intercourse. Most often, the age of consent for heterosexual and female homosexual intercourse is lower than the age of consent for male homosexual intercourse. The [[gay rights movement]] has been attempting in many places to establish an equal age of consent regardless of the sex of the partners; this has resulted in many jurisdictions adopting a common age of consent, though conservatives have frequently and successfully opposed this (see [[Sodomy law]]). However, the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision in [[Lawrence v. Texas]] in 2003 effectively invalidated the disparity between heterosexual and homosexual ages of consent within the US.

* [[Australia]]:
** Australia is a Federation of States and Territories.  Australia's Constitution protects and retains certain residual powers for the States and so the Australian Federal Government (the Commonwealth) has constitutional limitations on what issues it can legislate.  This means that each State has its own laws regarding AOC. However, it is worth mentioning that a 1997 Federal Government and the United Nations Human Rights Committee ruling caused each State to repeal any differences in homo/heterosexual AOC. This is due to International Affairs being a power of the Commonwealth.

* [[Austria]]: 14 (as of [[August 13]], [[2002]])

* [[Belgium]]: 16 (possible restrictions apply under 18)

* [[Brazil]]: 
** 18; 
** 14-17 prosecutable only after a complaint by the minor.
** Under 14 there seems to be some confusion regarding the age below which the state may unilaterally bring charges without a complaint from the child or parent.  Some sources suggest it is 12, others 10.

* [[Bulgaria]]: 14

* [[Canada]]: 14 (18 for anal sex between persons not married to each other in all provinces except Ontario and Quebec; 18 for anyone in a position of &quot;trust or authority&quot;)
** Courts in Ontario (1995) and Quebec (1998) independently declared Section 159 of the Criminal Code of Canada (Anal Intercourse) unconstitutional.  Although not binding in other provinces, these rulings have set a precedent that would make successful prosecution elsewhere in Canada unlikely.
** Persons under 18 are still deemed unable to consent to sexual activity in certain contexts, such as prostitution or pornography; or with certain persons in a position of authority. 
** Sex between partners that are within two years of age of each other is always legal unless the age of consent is 18 due to one of the conditions specified above. (14 and 15 year olds are granted an exemption if their partner is less than two years younger than them, 12 and 13 year olds specifically cannot be charged with a violation of the age of consent law, and 11 year olds and under cannot be charged with a crime in Canada.)

* [[Chile]]: 14

* [[China|China, People's Republic of]]: 14
** [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong S.A.R.]]: male homosexual 21 (and both the older AND younger partners can be prosecuted and liable to imprisonment for life) [gay sex laws recently overturned by court], lesbian 16, heterosexual 16.

* [[Republic of China|China, Republic of; (Taiwan)]]: 16, including heterosexual and homosexual relationships

* [[Colombia]]: 14

* [[Croatia]]: 14 or 18

* [[Czech Republic]]: 15

* [[Denmark]]: 15 for full consent (in regard to age differences) to sexual relationships; no limits when ages are less than 1 year apart (Meaning, no criminal charges are brought) ; 18 for dependency relationships (teacher/student etc.) and professional sexual ([[Prostitution]] is decriminalized in Denmark, but one can consent only when 18 or older).

* [[Ecuador]]:
** 14;
** 18 if woman is &quot;honest&quot; (not a prostitute) and &quot;seduction&quot; or deceit is used.

* [[Egypt]]: 18, homosexual sex is not mentioned in the law but homosexuals are prosecuted under various moral statutes

* [[Estonia]]: 14

* [[Finland]]: 16; 18 in dependency relationships (teacher/student etc.)and prostitution.

* [[France]]: 15; however sex with a minor under 18 in a dependency relationship may be criminalized.

* [[Germany]]:
** 18 years in dependency relationships (teacher/student etc.)
** 16 years if the older partner is over 18 and coerces the younger partner into sex other than by physical means, or if the older partner pays the younger partner to have sex ([[prostitution]])
** 16 years if the older partner is over 21 and exploits &quot;lack of sexual self-determination&quot; of the younger partner (only prosecuted after complaints or &amp;#8220;public interest&quot;, in practice rarely prosecuted with little or no punishment)
** 14 years for all other sexual relationships

* [[Greece]]: 15 (since [[1987]])

* [[Guyana]]: 13 (legislation to raise the age to 16 is [http://www.gina.gov.gy/archive/daily/b050601.html#8 under discussion])

* [[Hungary]]:
** Since the 2002 decision of the Constitutional Court 14 for both heterosexual and homosexual relationships

* [[Iceland]]: 14

* [[Indonesia]]: 17 (18 for homosexual men)

* [[Iran]]: extramarital sex is illegal (see: [[Marriageable age]]), note that homosexual sex may be punishable by death

* [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland, Republic of]]: 17, 15 for non-penetrative sexual contact.
** Different sections of law, and indeed different government departments disagree on whether the age of consent is 17 or 16 or even 15, or whether or not a disparity still exists between male and female ages. The majority of sex education literature in schools, as well as the most recent act referencing the age of consent state 16, however more recent [[Dáil]] debates have put this into doubt. 

* [[Israel]]: 16, but if the female is under 16 and above 14, the age difference should not be greater than 3 years between her and her partner. 18 if dependency relationships (teacher/student etc.)

* [[Italy]]: 14

* [[Japan]]: 13 nationwide. Some prefectures have additional legislation concerning sex with children between 13 and 16 (or 18 if &quot;insincere&quot; relation or prostitution), making the actual age of consent vary between 13 and 16 if prostitution is excluded. Age of marriage for a female with parental approval is 16.

* [[Jersey]]: 16 (18 for homosexual intercourse)

* [[Kazakhstan]]: 18

* [[Latvia]]: 16

* [[Lithuania]]: 14

* [[Madagascar]]: quite possibly 21 (heterosexual and homosexual)

**Although anti-pedophile laws in New Zealand (as with all other western countries) are currently severe, consensual relationship between adults and young teens are usually not prosecuted unless the parent or child complain about it.
**Before 2005, there was never a law in New Zealand prohibiting any form of sexual relationship between women and boys.  Until the Crimes Amendment Act (No.2) came into force in May 2005, the age of consent was 16 for older men and young girls, as well as for homosexual males (since legalization in 1986), but there was no age of consent where a woman was the older partner with a boy, and for Lesbian sex the age of consent was 12 if both partners were under 21 (16 if otherwise).  This law was only amended recently after being in force for over 100 years.  The legal loophole was identified in 2003 when a 21-year-old man faced imprisonment for sex with a 14-year-old girl, while a 21-year-old woman at the same time made her relationship with a 13-year-old boy public with the media because she knew she couldn't be charged.
** New Zealand decriminalised prostitution in 2003 with a legal age of 18.

* [[United Kingdom]]: The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] is the relevant law. Ages of consent are the same for heterosexuals and homosexuals, but legal treatment varies slightly between different areas of the UK.
**[[England]] and [[Wales]]: heterosexual and homosexual 16 for both sexes
**[[Scotland]]: heterosexual and male homosexual 16
**[[Northern Ireland]]: heterosexual and male homosexual 17
**18 years for any sexual act if there is a relationship of trust (e.g. teacher/pupil), unless they are a married couple.
**Until 2003, there was no specific law regarding the female homosexual, though in England and Wales this has now been set at 16 years old.  Although no such legislation exists for Scotland and Northern Ireland, a female under 16 is deemed incapable of consenting to any type of sexual behaviour which could be classed as sexual assault and the courts have taken this to mean that the age of consent is the same as for male homosexual acts.
**Before 2001 the homosexual age of consent in England and Wales was 18, and before the early 1990s it was 21, the age it was set at when consensual [[buggery]] was decriminalised in the 1960s. The heterosexual age of consent was raised from 12 to 16 in the late 19th Century.

* [[United States]]:  Varies from state to state, usually 16; some states formerly forbade homosexual acts entirely, however such laws have been declared unconstitutional in 2003 (''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''). ''Lawrence'' also had the effect of invalidating the differences between heterosexual and homosexual age of consent laws; the general, albeit untested, consensus is that the youngest age of consent law on the books in any given state now applies regardless of sexuality. 
**Federal law forbids crossing state lines or international borders with a person who is under 18 (in an attempt to escape the state's AOC or without permission from the minor's legal guardian), or any sex with a person who is under 16 and at least 4 years younger than the perpetrator in Federal territories ([http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/18/parts/i/chapters/109a/sections/section_2243.html 18 U.S.C. 2243], [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/18/parts/i/chapters/117/sections/section_2423.html 18 U.S.C. 2423]). Federal and various state laws makes it is illegal to produce [[pornography]] featuring those under 18 and prosecutions have been commenced for cases where both partners are over the age of consent and under 18 years old, where they were making material solely for their own consumption or that of their lawful partner.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''[[Alypius of Thagaste]] is also the name of an early [[Christian]] [[Saint]].''
'''Alypius of Antioch''' was a [[geographer]] of the mid [[4th century]] who 
was sent by the emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] into [[Roman Britain|Britain]] as [[vicarius]]. He ruled during a difficult period and he was probably considered suitable for the post because he came from the far east of the empire and had no associations with the west. He may have had to deal with the insurrection of the usurper named '[[Carausius II]].'

Alypius was afterwards commissioned to rebuild the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] as part of Julian's systematic attempt to reverse the [[Christianization]] of the [[Roman Empire]] by restoring [[pagan]] and, in this case, [[Judaism|Jewish]] practices. Among the letters of Julian are two (29 and 30) addressed to Alypius; one inviting him to [[Rome]], the other thanking him for a geographical treatise, which no longer exists.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amalasuntha''' (also known as '''Amalasuentha''' or '''Amalaswintha''') (d. [[535]]) was a queen of the [[Ostrogoth]]s.

A daughter of Ostrogothic king [[Theodoric the Great]], she secretly married a slave named [[Traguilla]]. When her mother [[Audofleda]] found them together Traguilla was killed.

She was married in [[515]] to Eutharic, an Ostrogoth noble of the old Areal line, who had previously been living in [[Visigoth]]ic [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]].  Her husband died, apparently in the early years of her marriage, leaving her with two children, [[Athalaric]] and [[Matasuentha]].  On the death of her father in [[526]], her son succeeded him, but she held the power as [[regent]] for her son.  Deeply imbued with the old Roman culture, she gave to that son's education a more refined and literary turn than suited the ideas of her Gothic subjects.  Conscious of her unpopularity she banished, and afterwards put to death, three Gothic nobles whom she suspected of intriguing against her rule, and at the same time opened negotiations with the emperor [[Justinian I]] with the view of removing herself and the Gothic treasure to [[Constantinople]]. Her son's death in [[534]] made little change in the posture of affairs.

Now queen, Amalasuntha made her cousin [[Theodahad]] partner of her throne (not, as sometimes stated, her husband, for his wife was still living), with the intent of strengthening her position.  The choice was unfortunate, for Theodahad, in spite of a varnish of literary culture, was a coward and a scoundrel.  He fostered the disaffection of the Goths, and either by his orders or with his permission, Amalasuntha was imprisoned on an island in the Tuscan lake of Bolsena, where in the spring of 535 she was murdered in her bath. 

The letters of [[Cassiodorus]], chief minister and literary adviser of Amalasuntha, and the histories of [[Procopius]] and [[Jordanes]], give us our chief information as to the character of Amalasuntha.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amalric''' (French '''Amaury''') '''of Bena''' (d.c. [[1204]]-[[1207]]) was a [[France|French]] [[theology|theologian]]. He was born in the latter part of the [[12th century]] at Bena, a village in the diocese of [[Chartres]].

He taught philosophy and theology at the university of Paris and enjoyed 
a great reputation as a subtle [[dialectic]]ian; his lectures developing the [[philosophy of Aristotle]] attracted a large circle of hearers.

In [[1204]] his doctrines were condemned by the university, and, on a personal appeal to [[Pope Innocent III]], the sentence was ratified, Amalric being ordered to return to Paris and recant his errors.

His death was caused, it is said, by grief at the humiliation to which he had been subjected.
In [[1209]] ten of his followers were burnt before the gates of Paris, and Amalric's own body was exhumed and burnt and the ashes given to the winds.

The doctrines of his followers, known as the [[Amalrician]]s, were formally condemned by the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215.

==Propositions==
Amalric appears to have derived his philosophical system from [[Johannes Scotus Erigena|Erigena]], whose principles he developed in a one-sided and strongly [[pantheist]]ic form.

Three propositions only can with certainty be attributed to him:

#that God is all;
#that every Christian is bound to believe that he is a member of the body of Christ, and that this belief is necessary for salvation;
#that he who remains in love of God can commit no sin.

These three propositions were further developed by his followers, who maintained that God revealed Himself in a threefold revelation, the first in Abraham, marking the epoch of the Father; the second in Christ, who began the epoch of the Son; and the third in Amalric and his disciples, who inaugurated the era of the [[Holy Ghost]].

Under the pretext that a true believer could commit no sin, the Amalricians indulged in every excess, and the sect does not appear to have long survived the death of its founder.

Schmidt]], ''Hist. de l'Eglise d'Occident itendant le moyen age'' (Paris, 1885); [[Hefele]], ''Conciliengesch.'' (2nd ed., Freiburg, 1886).

'''Afonso I of Portugal''' ([[English language|English]] ''Alphonzo'' or ''Alphonse''), more commonly known as '''Afonso Henriques''' ([[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /{{IPA|ɐ.'fõ.su e&amp;#771;.'ʁi.kɨʃ}}/), or also ''Affonso'' (Archaic Portuguese), ''Alfonso'' or ''Alphonso'' ([[Portuguese-Galician languages|Portuguese-Galician]]) or ''Alphonsus'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] version), ([[Guimarães]], [[1109]]?, traditionally [[July 25]] &amp;ndash; [[Coimbra]], [[1185]], [[December 6]]), also known as ''the Conqueror'' ([[Portuguese language|Port.]] ''o Conquistador''), was the first [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]], declaring his independence from [[Kingdom of León|León]].

==Life==
Afonso I was the son of [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy, Count of Portugal]] and [[Teresa of León]], the illegitimate daughter of King [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI of Castile and León]].  He was proclaimed King on [[July 26]] [[1139]], immediately after the [[Battle of Ourique]], and died on [[December 6]] [[1185]] in [[Coimbra]].

At the end of the [[11th century]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] [[Politics|political]] agenda was mostly concerned with the ''[[Reconquista]]'', the driving out of the [[Muslim]] successor-states to the [[Caliph]]ate of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] after its collapse. With European [[military]] [[Aristocracy|aristocracies]] focused on the [[Crusades]], Alfonso VI called for the help of the [[France|French]] [[nobility]] to deal with the [[Moors]]. In exchange, he was to give the hands of his daughters in wedlock to the leaders of the expedition and bestow royal privileges to the others. Thus, the royal heiress [[Urraca of Castile]] wedded [[Raymond of Burgundy]], younger son of the [[County of Burgundy|Count of Burgundy]], and her half-sister, princess [[Teresa of León]], wedded his cousin, another French crusader, [[Henry of Burgundy]], younger brother of the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Duke of Burgundy]], whose mother was daughter of the [[Count of Barcelona]]. Henry was made Count of Portugal, a burdensome [[earldom]] south of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], where Moorish incursions and attacks were to be expected. With his wife Teresa as co-ruler of Portugal, Henry withstood the ordeal and held the lands for his father-in-law.

From this wedlock several sons were born, but only one, '''Afonso Henriques''' (meaning &quot;Afonso son of Henry&quot;) thrived. The boy followed his father as '''Count of Portugal''' in [[1112]], under the tutelage of his mother. The relations between Teresa and her son Afonso proved difficult. Only eleven years old, Afonso already had his own political ideas, greatly different from his mother's. In [[1120]], the young [[prince]] took the side of the [[archbishop]] of [[Braga]], a political foe of Teresa, and both were exiled by her orders. Afonso spent the next years away from his own [[county]], under the watch of the bishop. In [[1122]] Afonso became fourteen, the adult age in the [[12th century]]. He made himself a [[knight]] on his own account in the [[Cathedral]] of [[Zamora]], raised an [[army]], and proceeded to take control of his lands. Near [[Guimarães]], at the [[Battle of São Mamede]] ([[1128]]) he overcame the troops under his mother's lover and ally Count [[Fernando Peres de Trava]] of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], making her his [[prison]]er and exiling her forever to a [[monastery]] in [[León, León|León]].  Thus the possibility of incorporating Portugal into a Kingdom of Galicia was eliminated and Afonso become sole ruler ('''Dux of Portugal''') after demands for independence from the county's people, church and nobles. He also vanquished [[Alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII of Castile and León]], another of his mother's allies, and thus freed the county from political dependence on the crown of [[Kingdom of León|León]] and [[Castile]]. On [[April 6]], [[1129]], Afonso Henriques dictated the writ in which he proclaimed himself '''Prince of Portugal'''.

{{House of Burgundy}}

Afonso then turned his arms against the everlasting problem of the [[Moors]] in the south. His campaigns were successful and, on [[July 26]] [[1139]], he obtained an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]], and straight after was unanimously proclaimed '''King of Portugal''' by his [[soldier]]s. This meant that Portugal was no longer a vassal county of León-Castile, but an independent kingdom in its own right. Next, he assembled the first assembly of the estates-general at [[Lamego]], where he was given the [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] from the archbishop of [[Braga]], to confirm the independence. 

Independence, however, was not a thing a land could choose on its own. Portugal still had to be acknowledged by the neighbouring lands and, most importantly, by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope]]. Afonso wedded [[Maud of Savoy|Mafalda of Savoy]], daughter of Count [[Amadeo III of Savoy]], and sent [[Ambassador|ambassador]]s to [[Rome]] to negotiate with the [[Pope]]. In Portugal, he built several monasteries and [[convent]]s and bestowed important privileges to [[religious order]]s. In [[1143]], he wrote to [[Pope Innocent II]] to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the Church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] peninsula. Bypassing any king of Castile or León, Afonso declared himself the direct [[liege]]man of the [[Papacy]]. Thus, Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] and [[Lisbon]] in [[1147]] (see [[Siege of Lisbon]]). He also conquered an important part of the land south of the [[Tagus]] River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years. 

Meanwhile, King Alfonso VII of Castile (Afonso's cousin) regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a [[war]], taking the side of the [[Aragon]]ese king, an enemy of Castile. To ensure the alliance, his son [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho]] was engaged to [[Dulce Berenguer]], sister of the [[Kings of Aragon|Count of Barcelona]], and princess of Aragon. Finally, in [[1143]], the [[Treaty of Zamora]] established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of Castile and León that Portugal was an independent kingdom.

In [[1169]], Afonso was disabled in an engagement near [[Badajoz]] by a fall from his [[horse]], and made prisoner by the soldiers of the king of León. Portugal was obliged to surrender as his [[ransom]] almost all the conquests Afonso had made in Galicia in the previous years.

In [[1179]] the privileges and favours given to the Roman Catholic Church were compensated. In the [[papal bull]] ''Manifestis Probatum'', [[Pope Alexander III]] acknowledged Afonso as King and Portugal as an independent land with the right to conquer lands from the Moors. With this papal blessing, Portugal was at last secured as a country and safe from any Castilian attempts of annexation.

In [[1184]], in spite of his great age, he had still sufficient energy to relieve his son Sancho, who was besieged in [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] by the Moors. He died shortly after, in [[1185]].

The Portuguese revere him as a hero, both on account of his personal character and as the founder of their [[nation]].

==Afonso's descendants==
Afonso married in 1146 Mafalda or [[Maud of Savoy]] ([[1125]]-[[1158]]), daughter of Amadeo III, Count of Savoy, and [[Mafalda of Albon]].

[[Image:AfonsoII-P.jpg|left|Afonso II of Portugal]]

'''Afonso II of Portugal''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /{{IPA|ɐ.'fõ.su}}/; [[English language|English]] ''Alphonzo''), or ''Affonso'' (Archaic Portuguese), ''Alfonso'' or ''Alphonso'' ([[Portuguese-Galician languages|Portuguese-Galician]]) or ''Alphonsus'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] version), known as ''the Fat'' ([[Portuguese language|Port.]] ''o Gordo''), third [[List of Portuguese monarchs|king of Portugal]], was born in [[Coimbra]] on [[April 23]] [[1185]] and died on [[March 25]] [[1223]] in the same city. He was the second but eldest surviving son of [[Sancho I of Portugal]] by his wife, Dulce of Barcelona, princess of Aragon. Afonso succeeded his father in [[1212]].

As a king, Afonso II set a different approach of government. Hitherto, Sancho I his father and [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso I]] his grandfather, were mostly concerned with military issues either against the neighbouring [[Castile]] or against the [[Moors]] in the south. Afonso did not pursue territory enlargement policies and managed to insure peace with Castile during his reign. Despite this, some towns, like [[Alcácer do Sal]] in [[1217]], were conquered from the Moors by the particular initiative of noblemen. This does not mean that he was a weak or somehow cowardly man. The first years of his reign were marked instead by internal disturbances between Afonso and his brothers and sisters. The king managed to keep security within Portuguese borders only by outlawing and exiling his kin. 

Since military issues were not a government priority, Afonso established the state's administration and centralized power on himself. He designed the first set of Portuguese written laws. These were mainly concerned with [[private property]], civil [[justice]], and [[minting]]. Afonso also sent ambassadors to [[European]] kingdoms outside the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and began amiable [[trade|commercial]] relations with most of them. 

Other reforms included the always delicate matters with the pope. In order to get the independence of Portugal recognized by the popes, his grandfather, Afonso I, had to legislate an enormous amount of privileges to the Church. These eventually created a state within the state. With Portugal's position as a country firmly established, Afonso II endeavoured to weaken the power of the [[clergy]] and to apply a portion of the enormous revenues of the [[Catholic church]] to purposes of national utility. These actions led to a serious diplomatic conflict between the pope and Portugal. After being [[excommunicated]] for his audacities by [[Pope Honorius III]], Afonso II promised to make amends to the church, but he died in [[1223]] before making any serious attempts to do so. 

===Afonso's descendents===

Afonso married [[Urraca, princess of Castile]], daughter of [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]], [[King of Castile]], and [[Leonora of Aquitaine]], in [[1208]].

'''Afonso III of Portugal''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /{{IPA|ɐ.'fõ.su}}/; [[English language|English]] ''Alphonzo''), or ''Affonso'' (Archaic Portuguese), ''Alfonso'' or ''Alphonso'' ([[Portuguese-Galician languages|Portuguese-Galician]]) or ''Alphonsus'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]),  the ''Bolognian'' ([[Portuguese language|Port.]] ''o Bolonhês'') or the ''Brave'' ([[Portuguese language|Port.]] ''o Bravo''), the fifth [[List of Portuguese monarchs|king of Portugal]] ([[May 5]] [[1210]] in [[Coimbra]] &amp;ndash; [[February 16]] [[1279]] in [[Alcobaça]], [[Coimbra]] or [[Lisbon]]). He was the second son of King [[Afonso II of Portugal]] and his wife, [[Urraca of Castile]]; he succeeded his brother, King [[Sancho II of Portugal]] in [[1247]].

As the second son of King Afonso II of Portugal, Afonso was not expected to inherit the throne, which was destined to go to his brother Sancho. He lived mostly in [[France]], were he married Matilda, the heiress of [[Boulogne]], in [[1238]], thereby becoming [[Count of Boulogne]]. In [[1246]], conflicts between his brother, the king, and the church became unbearable. [[Pope Innocent IV]] then ordered Sancho II to be removed from the throne and be replaced by the Count of Boulogne. Afonso, of course, did not refuse the papal order and marched to Portugal. Since Sancho was not a popular king, the order was not hard to enforce; he was exiled to [[Castile]] and Afonso III became king in [[1247]]. To ascend the throne, he abdicated from the county of Boulogne and later ([[1253]]) divorced Matilda. In 1253 he married Brites (Beatrix), an illegitimate daughter of King [[Alfonso X of Castile]]. Determined not to commit the same mistakes as his brother, Afonso III paid special attention to what the middle class composed of merchants and small land owners had to say. In [[1254]], in the city of [[Leiria]], he held the first session of the ''[[Cortes Generales|Cortes]]'', a general assembly, comprised of the nobility, the middle class and representatives of all [[municipalities]]. He also made laws intended to restrain the upper classes from abusing the least favoured part of the population. Remembered as a notable administrator, Afonso III founded several towns, granted the title of city to many others and reorganized public administration. 

[[Image:EstatuaDAfonsoIIIFaro.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Afonso III in [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].]]

Secure on the throne, Afonso III then proceeded to make war with the [[Muslim]] communities that still thrived in the south. In his reign the [[Algarve]] became part of the kingdom following the capture of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]]&amp;mdash;Portugal thus becoming the first Iberian kingdom to complete its ''[[Reconquista]]''. Following his success against the Moors, Afonso III had to deal with a political situation arising from the borders with Castile. The neighbouring kingdom considered that the newly acquired lands of Algarve should be Castilian, not Portuguese, which led to a series of wars between the countries. Finally, in [[1267]], a treaty was signed in [[Badajoz]], determining that the southern border between Castile and Portugal should be the River [[Guadiana]], as it is today.

===Afonso's marriages and descendants===
Afonso's first wife was [[Matilda II of Boulogne]], daughter of [[Renaud, Count of Dammartin]], and [[Ida of Boulogne]]. She had two sons but both died young (Roberto and an unnamed one). He divorced Matilda in [[1253]] and in the same year married [[Beatrix of Castile]], illegitimate daughter of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]], [[King of Castile]], and [[Maria de Guzman]].

'''Afonso IV of Portugal''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /{{IPA|ɐ.'fõ.su}}/; [[English language|English]] ''Alphonzo''), or ''Affonso'' (Archaic Portuguese), ''Alfonso'' or ''Alphonso'' ([[Portuguese-Galician languages|Portuguese-Galician]]) or ''Alphonsus'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]), ([[February 8]] [[1291]] &amp;ndash; [[May 28]] [[1357]]), known as ''the Brave'' ([[Portuguese language|Port.]] ''o Bravo''), was the seventh [[List of Portuguese monarchs|king of Portugal]] from [[1325]] until his death. He was the only legitimate son of [[Dinis of Portugal]] by his wife [[Elizabeth of Portugal|Elizabeth]].

[[Image:AfonsoIV-P.jpg|left|Afonso IV of Portugal]]

Afonso, born in [[Lisbon]], was his father's only legitimate son and the rightful heir to the Portuguese throne. However, he was not, according to several sources, Dinis' favourite son; his half-brother, the illegitimate [[Afonso Sanches]], enjoyed full royal favour. From early in life, the notorious rivalry led to several outbreaks of [[civil war]]. On [[January 7]], [[1325]], Afonso's father died and he became king, taking full revenge on his brother. His rival was sentenced to [[exile]] in [[Castile]], and stripped of all the lands and [[fiefdom]]s donated by their common father. Afonso Sanches, however, did not sit still. From Castile, he orchestrated a series of attempts to usurp the crown for himself. After a few failed attempts at invasion, both brothers signed a peace treaty, arranged by the Queen Isabella.

In [[1309]], Afonso IV married princess Beatrice, daughter of King [[Sancho IV of Castile]] by his wife [[Maria de Molina]]. The first-born of this union, princess [[Maria of Portugal]], married King [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] in [[1328]], at the same time that Afonso IV's heir, Peter, was promised to another Castilian princess, [[Constance of Penafiel]]. These arrangements were imperiled by the ill will of Alfonso XI of Castile, who was, at the time, publicly mistreating his wife. Afonso IV was not happy to see his daughter abused, and started a war against Castile. Peace arrived four years later, with the intervention of princess Maria herself. A peace treaty was signed in [[Seville]] in [[1339]] and, in the next year, Portuguese troops played an important role in the victory of the [[Battle of Rio Salado]] over the Marinids [[Moors]] in October [[1340]].

The last part of Afonso IV's reign is marked not by open warfare against Castile, but by political intrigue. Civil war between King [[Peter I of Castile]] and his half-brother [[Henry of Trastamara]] led to the exile of many Castilian [[nobility|noble]]s to [[Portugal]]. These immigrants immediately created a faction among the Portuguese court, aiming at privileges and power that, somehow, could compensate what they lost at home. The faction grew in power, especially after [[Ines de Castro]], daughter of an important nobleman and maid of the [[Constance of Penafiel|Crown Princess Constance]], became the lover of her lady's husband: [[Peter I of Portugal|Peter]], the heir of Portugal. Afonso IV was displeased with his son's choice of lovers, and hoped that the relationship would be a futile one. Unfortunately for internal politics, it was not. Peter was openly in love with Ines, recognized all the children she bore, and, worst of all, favoured the Castilians that surrounded her. Moreover, after his wife's death in [[1349]], Peter refused the idea of marrying anyone other than Ines herself. 

The situation became worse as the years passed and the aging Afonso lost control over his court. Peter's only male heir, future king [[Fernando of Portugal]], was a sickly child, while the illegitimate children sired with Ines thrived. Worried about his legitimate grandson's life, and the growing power of Castile within Portugal's borders, Afonso ordered the murder of [[Ines de Castro]] in [[1355]]. He expected his son to act reasonably, but the heir was not able to forgive him for the act. Enraged at the barbaric act, Peter put himself at the head of an army and devastated the country between the [[Douro]] and the [[Minho]] rivers before he was reconciled to his father in early [[1357]]. Afonso died almost immediately after, in Lisbon in May.

As king, Afonso IV is remembered as a soldier and a valiant general, hence the nickname ''the Brave''. But perhaps his most important contribution was the importance he gave to the Portuguese [[navy]]. Afonso IV granted public funding to raise a proper [[trade|commercial]] fleet and ordered the first maritime explorations. The [[Canary Islands]] (today a part of [[Spain]]) were discovered during his reign.

===Afonso's descendants===

Afonso married Beatrice of [[Castile]] ([[1293]]-[[1359]]) in [[1309]], daughter of [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]], [[King of Castile]], and Maria de Molia and had four sons and three daughters.

[[Image:AfonsoV-P.jpg|left|Afonso V of Portugal]]
'''Afonso V of Portugal''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /{{IPA|ɐ.'fõ.su}}/; [[English language|English]] ''Alphonzo''), or ''Affonso'' (Archaic Portuguese), ''the African'' ([[Portuguese language|Port.]] ''o Africano''), 12th [[List of Portuguese monarchs|king of Portugal]] was born in [[Sintra]] in [[January 15]] [[1432]] and died in the same city in [[August 28]] [[1481]]. He was the oldest son of king [[Duarte of Portugal]] by his wife, princess Eleanor of [[Aragon]]. Afonso V was onlly six years old when he succeeded his father in [[1438]]. 

During his minority, Afonso V was placed under the regency of his mother, according to a late will of his father. As both a foreigner and a woman, the queen was not a popular choice for regent. Opposition rose and the queen's only ally was [[Afonso, Duke of Braganza|Afonso]], the illegitimate half brother of Duarte I and count of Barcelos. In the following year, the ''Cortes'' (assembly of the kingdom) decide to replace the queen with [[Pedro, Duke of Coimbra]], the young king's oldest uncle. His main policies were concerned with avoiding the development of great noble houses, kingdoms inside the kingdom, and concentrating power in the person of the king. The country prospered under his rule, but not peacefully, as his laws interfered with the ambition of powerful nobles. The count of Barcelos, a personal enemy of the duke of Coimbra (despite being half-brothers) eventually became the king's favourite uncle and began a constant struggle for power. In [[1442]], the king made Afonso the first [[Duke of Braganza]]. With this title and its lands, he became the most powerful man in Portugal and one of the richest men in Europe. To secure his position as regent, in [[1445]] Pedro married his daughter, Isabel of Coimbra, princess of Portugal, to Afonso V.  

But in [[June 9]] [[1448]], when the king came of age, Pedro had to surrender his power to Afonso V.  The years of conspiracy by the duke of Braganza finally came to a head. In [[September 15]] of the same year, Afonso V nullified all the laws and edicts approved under the regency. The situation became unstable and, in the following year, being led by what he afterwards discovered to be false representations, Afonso declared Pedro a rebel and defeated his army in the [[battle of Alfarrobeira]], in which both his uncle and father in law was killed. After this battle and the loss of one of Portugal's most remarkable princes, the duke of Braganza became the ''de facto'' ruler of the country. 

Afonso V then turned his attentions to the North of Africa. In his grandfather's ([[John I of Portugal]]) reign, [[Ceuta]] had been conquered to the king of [[Morocco]], now the new king wanted to expand the conquests. The king's army conquered Alcacer Ceguer ([[1458]]), [[Tangiers]] (won and lost several times between [[1460]] and [[1464]]) and [[Arzila]] ([[1470]]). This achievements granted the king the nickname of ''African''. The king also supported the exploration of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] led by prince [[Henry the Navigator]] but, after Henry's death in [[1460]] he did nothing to pursue this course of action. Administratively, Afonso V was an absent king, since he did not pursue development of laws or commerce, preferring to stand with the legacy of his father and grandfather. 

[[Image:Domafonsov.jpg|left|200px|Afonso V of Portugal, Conqueror of African strongholds]]
When the campaigns in Africa were over, Afonso V found new grounds to battle in the Iberian Peninsula. In neighbouring [[Castile]], a huge scandal with political and dynastic implications was rising. King [[Henry IV of Castile]] was dying without heirs. From his two marriages, only a daughter, [[Joan, princess of Castile]] had been born. But her paternity was questioned, as rumour said the king was impotent and the queen, princess Joana of Portugal, had a notorious affair with a nobleman called Beltrán de La Cueva. The birth of princess Joan in [[1462]], openly called ''the Beltraneja'', caused the divorce of her parents. She was never consider legitimate and, now that the king was dying, no one took her as a serious contender for the crown. Her aunt, [[Isabella I of Castile]] that was due to inherit the crown. But Afonso V was keen to interfere with the succession in Castile. In [[1475]] he married his niece Joan, the Beltraneja, who he considered the legitimate heir to the crown. Since her adulteress mother was his own sister, Afonso V had not only ambition, but the family honour to protect. He proclaimed himself king of Castile and [[Kingdom of León|León]] and prepared to defend his wife's rights. But in the following year he was defeated at the [[battle of Toro]] by king [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], the husband of Isabella of Castile.  He went to [[France]] to obtain the assistance of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], but finding himself deceived by the French monarch, he returned to Portugal in [[1477]] with very low spirits. Disillusioned and depressed he fell into a deep melancholy and abdicated to his son João. After this, he retired to a monastery in [[Sintra]] where he died in 1481. His death was mourned in the country, by the people who loved the king, and by the nobles who were starting to fear his successor.

Afonso was a direct descendant of [[Edward III of England]] through his son [[John of Gaunt]] and therefore was a direct descendant of [[William the Conqueror]], [[King of England]].

===Afonso's marriages and descendants===
Afonso married first to his cousin [[Isabel of Coimbra]] in [[1447]]. Isabel died in [[1455]] and Afonso married again (although not recognized by the Papacy) in [[1475]], this time to [[Joan, princess of Castile|Joan of Castile]] (known as &quot;la Beltraneja&quot;), daughter of [[Henry IV of Castile]] and [[Joan of Portugal]]. This marriage was an attempt to inherit the throne of Castile as Joan was the sole daughter of Henry IV. However this didn't happen as Afonso lost a short war with Castile.

'''Afonso VI''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /{{IPA|ɐ.'fõ.su}}/; [[English language|English]] ''Alphonzo'' or ''Alphonse''), or ''Affonso'' (Old Portuguese), ([[August 21]],[[1643]]-[[September 12]], [[1683]]) was the twenty-second (or twenty-third according to some historians) [[Kings of Portugal|King]] of [[Portugal]], the second of the [[House of Braganza]], known as '''the Victorious''' ([[Portuguese language|Port.]] ''o Vitorioso'').

He succeeded his father ([[João IV]]) in [[1656]] at the age of thirteen. His mother, ([[D. Luisa de Gusmão]]) was named regent in his father's will.  At the age of three, he had suffered an illness that left him paralyzed on the left side of his body, as well as leaving him mentally unstable. This, plus his disinterest in ruling left his mother as regent for six years, until 1662.  Luisa oversaw military victories over the [[Spain|Spanish]] at [[Ameixial]] ([[June 8]] [[1663]]) and [[Montes Claros]] ([[June 17]] [[1665]]), culminating in the final Spanish recognition of Portugal's independence on [[February 13]] [[1668]]. Colonial affairs saw the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] conquest of [[Jaffnapatam]], Portugal's last colony in [[Sri Lanka]] ([[1658]]) and the cession of [[Bombay]] and [[Tangier]] to [[England]] ([[June 23]] [[1661]]) as dowry for Afonso's sister, [[Catherine of Braganza]] who had married King [[Charles II of England]]. English mediation in 1661 saw the [[Netherlands]] acknowledge Portuguese rule of [[Brazil]] in return for uncontested control of Sri Lanka. 
In [[1667]] In 1662, the [[Conde de Castelo-Melhor|Count of Castelo-Melhor]] saw an opportunity to gain power at court by befriending the king. He managed to convince the king that his mother was out to steal his throne and exile him from Portugal. As a result, Afonso took control of the throne and his mother sent to a convent. 

[[Image:AfonsoVIPortugal.jpg|left|thumb|150px]]He was married to ([[Marie Françoise of Nemours]]), the daughter of the Duke of Savoy, in 1666, but this marriage would not last long. Marie, or Maria Francisca, as the Portuguese call her, filed for an annullment in 1667 based on the impotence of the king. The Church granted her the annulment, and she married Afonso's brother, D. Pedro, (future ([[D. Pedro II]])). That same year, D. Pedro managed to gain enough support to force the king to relinquish control of the government and he became the Prince Regent. Afonso was banished to the island of [[Terceira]] in the [[Azores]] for seven years, returning to Portugal shortly before he died at [[Sintra]] in [[1683]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">There has not been a monarch known as '''Alphonso''' or '''Alfonso I of Spain''', the first king of that name of the unified [[Spain]] being [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]] ([[1874]]-[[1885]]).

Several precursor kingdoms have had an '''Alfonso I'''. You may have been looking for:
*[[Alfonso I of Asturias]] ([[739]]-[[757]]).
*[[Alfonso I of Aragon]] and Navarre ([[1104]]-[[1134]]), known as ''the Battler''.
*[[Alfonso II of Aragon|Alfons I, Count of Barcelona]] ([[1162]]-[[1196]]) known as ''el Cast (the Chaste)'' or ''el Trobador (the Troubadour)'', also Alfonso II of Aragon.

'''Alfonso II''' ([[759]]-[[842]], king [[791]]), [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alfonso I]]'s reputed grandson, bears the name of &quot;the Chaste.&quot;

The [[Arab]] writers who speak of the [[Spain|Spanish]] kings of the north-west as the Beni-Altons, appear to recognize them as a royal stock derived from Alfonso I.

The events of his reign are in reality unknown.  Poets of a later generation invented the story of the secret marriage of his sister Ximena with Sancho, count of Saldana, and the feats of their son [[Bernardo del Carpio]].  Bernardo is the hero of a ''[[cantar de gesta]]'' (''chanson de geste'') written to please the anarchical spirit of the nobles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amara Sinha''' (c. [[375|AD 375]]) was a [[Sanskrit]] [[grammar]]ian and [[poet]], of whose personal history hardly anything is known.

He is said to have been &quot;one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of [[Vikramaditya]],&quot; and according to the evidence of Hsuan Tsang, this is the [[Chandragupta Vikramaditya]] ([[Chandragupta II]]) that flourished about AD 375.

Amara seems to have been a [[Buddhist]]; and an early tradition asserts that his works, with one exception, were destroyed during the persecution carried on by the orthodox [[Brahmin]]s in the [[5th century]]. The exception is the celebrated ''Amara-Kosha'' (''Treasury of Amara''), a vocabulary of Sanskrit roots, in three books, and hence sometimes called ''Trikanda'' or the &quot;Tripartite.&quot;

It contains 10,000 words, and is arranged, like other works of its class, in metre, to aid the memory.  The first chapter of the ''Kosha'' was printed at [[Rome]] in Tamil character in 1798.  An edition of the entire work, with English notes and an index by [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|HT Colebrooke]], appeared at [[Serampore]] in 1808. The Sanskrit text was printed at [[Calcutta]] in 1831.  A French translation by ALA Loiseleur-Deslongchamps as published at Paris in 1839.

'''Alfonso XII of Spain''' ([[November 28]], [[1857]]&amp;ndash;[[November 25]], [[1885]]), was king of [[Spain]], reigning from 1875 to 1885, after a ''[[coup d'état]]'' restored the monarchy and ended the ephemeral [[First Spanish Republic]].

He was son of [[Isabella II of Spain]].  His biological paternity is uncertain, though his legal paternity is not: his mother was married to her homosexual cousin [[Francis of Asis de Bourbon]], Infante, and king Consort of Spain, eldest son of the duke of Cadiz, at the time of Alfonso's conception and birth. Alfonso's biological father is said to have been Enrique Puig y Moltó, a captain of the guard, or [[Francisco Serrano y Dominguez|General Serrano]].

When Queen Isabella and her husband were forced to leave Spain by the [[revolution of 1868]], Alfonso accompanied them to [[Paris]], and from there he was sent to the [[Theresianum]] at [[Vienna]] to continue his studies.  On [[June 25]] [[1870]] he was recalled to Paris, where his mother abdicated in his favour, in the presence of a number of Spanish nobles who had followed the fortunes of the exiled queen.  He assumed the title of Alfonso XII; for although no king of united Spain had previously borne the name, the Spanish monarchy was regarded as continuous with the more ancient monarchy, represented by the eleven kings of [[Kingdom of León|León]] and [[Castile]] also named [[Alfonso]].  Shortly afterwards he proceeded to the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in the [[United Kingdom]], to continue his military studies, and while there he issued, on the [[December 1]], [[1874]], in reply to a birthday greeting from his followers, a manifesto proclaiming himself the sole representative of the Spanish monarchy.  At the end of the year, when Marshal Serrano left [[Madrid]] to take command of the northern army in the [[Carlist War]], Brigadier [[Arsenio Martínez Campos|Martinez Campos]], who had long been working more or less openly for the king, carried off some battalions of the central army to [[Sagunto]], rallied to his own flag the troops sent against him, and entered [[Valencia]] in the king's name.  Thereupon the president of the council resigned, and the power was transferred to the king's plenipotentiary and adviser, [[Canovas del Castillo]].  In the course of a few days the king arrived at Madrid, passing through [[Barcelona]] and Valencia, and was received everywhere with acclamation (1875).  In 1876 a vigorous campaign against the [[Carlists]], in which the young king took part, resulted in the defeat of [[Infante Carlos of Spain|Don Carlos]] and his abandonment of the struggle.  On [[January 23]], [[1878]] Alfonso married his cousin, Princess [[Maria de las Mercedes of Spain|Maria de las Mercedes]], daughter of the duc de Montpensier, but she died within six months of her marriage. Towards the end of the same year a young workman of [[Tarragona]], [[Juan Oliva Moncasi]], fired at the king in Madrid.  

On [[November 29]], [[1879]] he married a much more distant relative, Archduchess [[Maria Christina of Austria]], daughter of [[Karl Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Karl Ferdinand of Austria]].  During the honeymoon a pastrycook named Otero fired at the young sovereigns as they were driving in Madrid.  

The children of this marriage were:
* [[Maria de las Mercedes]], Princess of Asturias, ([[September 11]], [[1880]] &amp;ndash; [[October 17]], [[1904]]), married on [[February 14]], [[1901]] to Prince Carlos of Bourbon, and titular heiress from the death of her father until the posthumous birth of her brother
* Maria Teresa, ([[November 12]], [[1882]] &amp;ndash; [[September 23]], [[1912]]), married to Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria on [[January 12]], [[1906]]
* King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] who was king from the moment of his birth and thus never held any other Spanish titles from the crown, such as Infante or Prince of Asturias. 

In 1881 the king refused to sanction the law by which the ministers were to remain in office for a fixed term of eighteen months, and upon the consequent resignation of Canovas del Castillo, he summoned [[Práxedes Mateo Sagasta]], the Liberal leader, to form a cabinet.  

Alfonso died of [[tuberculosis]].  

Coming to the throne at such an early age, he had served no apprenticeship in the art of ruling, but he possessed great natural tact and a sound judgment ripened by the trials of exile.  Benevolent and sympathetic in disposition, he won the affection of his people by fearlessly visiting the districts ravaged by cholera or devastated by [[earthquake]] in 1885.  His capacity for dealing with men was considerable, and he never allowed himself to become the instrument of any particular party.  In his short reign, peace was established both at home and abroad, the finances were well regulated, and the various administrative services were placed on a basis that afterwards enabled [[Spain]] to pass through the disastrous war with the [[United States]] without even the threat of a revolution.

'''Alfonso XIII of Spain''' ([[May 17]], [[1886]] &amp;ndash; [[February 28]], [[1941]]), [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]], posthumous son of [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], was proclaimed King at his birth. He reigned from 1886-1931. His mother, Queen [[Maria Christina of Austria]], was appointed [[regent]] during his minority. In 1902, on attaining his 16th year, the King assumed control of the government.

The growth of the young monarch can be seen in his portraits on Spain's periodically issued [[peseta]] coins.

On [[May 31]], [[1906]] he married Scottish-born [[Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] (1887-1969), a niece of King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]] and a granddaughter of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom]]. A [[Serene Highness]] by birth, Ena, as she was known, was raised to Royal Highness status a month before her wedding to prevent the union from being viewed as unequal. As Alfonso XIII and Queen Ena were returning from the wedding they narrowly escaped the assassination attempted by the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Mateu Morral]]; instead, the bomb explosion killed or injured many bystanders and members of the royal procession. 

The royal couple had seven children: 
* [[Infante]] Alfonso Pío Cristino Eduardo, [[Prince of Asturias]] ([[1907]]-[[1938]]), a [[hemophiliac|hemophiliac]], he renounced his rights to the throne in 1933 to marry a commoner, Edelmira  Sampedro Ocejo y Robato, and became Count of [[Covadonga]]. He later remarried to Marta Esther Rocafort y Altazarra, but had no issue by either of them.
* Infante [[Infante Jaime of Spain, Duke of Segovia|Jaime Luitpold Isabelino Enrique]] ([[1908]]-[[1975]]), a [[deaf-mute]] as the result of a childhood operation, he renounced his rights to the throne in 1933 and became Duke of [[Segovia]], and later Duke of Madrid, and who, as a [[legitimist]] [[pretender to the French throne]] from 1941 to 1975, was known as the Duke of [[Anjou]].
* Infanta Beatriz Isabel Federica Alfonsa Eugenia ([[1909]]-[[2002]]), who married [[Don Alessandro Torlonia, 5th Prince di Civitella-Cesi]].
* Infante Fernando, [[stillborn]] (1910)
* Infanta [[Maria Cristina Teresa Alejandra]] ([[1911]]-[[1996]]), who married Enrico Eugenio Marone-Cinzano, 1st Conte di Marone.
* Infante [[Juan de Borbón, Count of Barcelona|Juan Carlos Teresa Silvestre Alfonso]] ([[1913]]-[[1993]]), named heir to the throne and Count of Barcelona.
* Infante Gonzalo Manuel María Bernardo ([[1914]]-[[1934]]), a hemophiliac.[[Image:Alfonso_XIII_sculpted_by_José_Navas-Parejo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Alfonso XIII sculpted by Jose Navas-Parejo]] 

The king also had three illegitimate children, Roger Leveque de Vilmorin (1905-1980), by French aristocrat Mélanie de Gaufridy de Dortan; Leandro Alfonso Ruíz Moragas (born in [[1929]]), officially recognized by Spanish courts on [[May 21]] [[2003]] as Leandro Alfonso de Borbón Ruíz, son of the King; and his sister, Ana María Teresa Ruíz Moragas. The mother of both siblings was the Spanish actress Carmen Ruíz Moragas.

During his reign [[Spain]] lost its last colonies in [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Philippines]]; lost several wars in north Africa; saw the start of the [[Spanish Generation of 1927]], and endured the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]].
He was a promoter of [[tourism in Spain]].
The problems with the lodging of his wedding guests prompted the construction of the luxury [[Hotel Palace]] in Madrid.
He also supported the creation of a network of state-run lodges (''[[Parador]]'') in historic buildings of Spain.
[[Image:Alfonso xiii illustration.3.jpg|thumb|left|125px]]His fondness for the sport of football led to the patronage of several &quot;royal&quot; clubs like [[Real Sociedad]], [[Real Madrid]], [[Real Betis Balompié]] and [[Real Unión]].
When the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed on [[April 14]] [[1931]], he abandoned the country with no formal abdication. When the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, Alfonso made it clear he favoured the military uprising against the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] government, but General [[Francisco Franco]] in September 1936 declared that the Nationalists would never accept Alfonso as king (the supporters of the rival [[Carlist]] made an important part of the Franco army). First he went into exile in [[France]]. Later he moved to [[Fascist Italy]], and died in [[Rome]] in 1941. After leaving his successory rights to his fourth, but second surviving, son [[Juan de Borbon, Count of Barcelona]], the father of the later King [[Juan Carlos of Spain|Juan Carlos]]. The count of Barcelona renounced his rights to the throne in 1977, in favor of his son, Juan Carlos.

In [[1431]] he was deputed by [[John II of Castile|John II, king of Castile]], to attend the council of [[Basel]], in which he made himself conspicuous by his learning.  He was the author of several works, the principal of which is entitled ''Rerum Hispanorum Romanorum imperatorum, summorum pontificum, nec non regum Francorum anacephaleosis''. This is a history of [[Spain]] from the earliest times down to [[1456]], and was printed at [[Granada]] in [[1545]], and also in the ''Rerum Hispanicarum Scriptores aliquot'', by R. Bel (Frankfort, 1579).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alfonso I''' (c.[[1073]] &amp;ndash; [[1134]]), called '''the Battler''', was the [[Kings of Aragon|king of Aragón]] and [[Kings of Navarre|Navarre]] from [[1104]] until his death in [[1134]].  He was the second son of King [[Sancho I of Aragon|Sancho Ramírez]] and successor of his brother [[Peter I of Aragon|Peter I]].  Alfonso the Battler won his greatest successes in the middle [[Ebro]], where he expelled the Moors from [[Zaragoza]] in [[1118]] and took [[Egea]], [[Tudela]], [[Calatayud]], [[Borja]], [[Tarazona]], [[Daroca]], and [[Monreal del Campo]].  He died in September 1134 after an unsuccessful battle with the [[Moors]] at the siege of [[Fraga]].

==Early life==

His earliest years were passed in the [[monastery]] of [[Siresa]], learning to read and write and the military arts by Lope Garcés the Pilgrim, who was repaid for his services by his former charge with the county of [[Pedrola]] when he came to the throne.  

During his brother's reign, he participated in the taking of Huesca (the [[Battle of Alcoraz]], [[1096]]), which became the largest city in the kingdom and the new capital.  He also joined [[El Cid]]'s expeditions in [[Valencia]].  His father gave him the lordships of [[Biel]], [[Luna]], [[Ardenes]], y [[Bailo]].  

A series of fortunate deaths put Alfonso directly in line for the throne.  His brother's children, Isabel and Peter (who married María Rodríguez, daughter of El Cid), died in [[1103]] and 1104 respectively.

==Reign==

===Marriage===

A passionate fighting-man (he fought twenty-nine battles against Christian or Moor), he was married  (when well over 30 years and a habitual bachelor) in [[1109]] to [[Urraca of Castile]], widow of [[Raymond of Burgundy]], a very dissolute and passionate woman.  The marriage had been arranged by her father [[Alfonso VI of Castile]] in 1106 to unite the two chief Christian states against the [[Almoravides]], and to supply them with a capable military leader.  But Urraca was tenacious of her right as proprietary queen and had not learnt chastity in the polygamous household of her father. Alfonso is reported to have said that a real soldier lives with men, not women. Husband and wife quarrelled with the brutality of the age and came to open war. Alfonso had the support of one section of the nobles who found their account in the confusion. Being a much better soldier than any of his opponents he gained victories at [[Sepulveda]] and [[Fuente de la Culebra]], but his only trustworthy supporters were his Aragonese, who were not numerous enough to keep [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Leon|León]] subjugated. The marriage of Alfonso and Urraca was declared null by the pope, as they were third cousins, in [[1114]]. During his marriage, he had called himself &quot;King and Emperor of Castile, Toledo, Aragón, Pamplona, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza&quot; in recognition of his rights as Urraca's husband; of his inheritance of the lands of his father, including the kingdom of his great-uncle [[Gonzalo of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza|Gonzalo]]; and his prerogative to conquer [[Andalusia]] from the Moor.  He inserted the title of ''imperator'' on the basis that he had three kingdoms under his rule.  

===Church relations===

The king quarrelled with the church, and particularly the [[Cistercian]]s, almost as violently as with his wife.  As he beat her, so he drove Archbishop Bernard into exile and expelled the monks of [[Sahagún]]. He was finally compelled to give way in Castile and Leon to his stepson [[Alfonso_VII_of_Castile|Alfonso Raimúndez]], son of Urraca and her first husband.  The intervention of [[Pope Calixtus II]] brought about an arrangement between the old man and his young namesake.  

In [[1122]] in Belchite, he founded a confraternity of knighst to fight agains the Almoravids.  It was the start of the military orders in Aragón.  Years later, he organised a branch of the ''Militia Christi'' of the [[Holy Land]] at [[Monreal del Campo]].  

===Reconquista===

Alfonso spent his first four years in near-constant war with the Moor.  In [[1105]], he conquered Ejea and Tauste and refortified Castellar and Juslibol.  In [[1106]], he defeated [[Ahmad II al-Musta'in]] of Zaragoza at Valtierra.  In [[1107]], he took Tamarite de Litera and Esteban de la Litera.  Then followed a period dominated by his relations with Castile and León through his wife, Urraca.  He resumed his Reconquista in [[1117]] by conquering Fitero, Corella, Cintruénigo, Murchante, Monteagudo, and Cascante from Islam.  

In [[1118]], the Council of Toulouse declared it a [[crusade]] to assist in the reconquest of [[Zaragoza]].  Many Frenchmen consequently joined Alfonso at [[Ayerbe]].  They took Almudévar, Gurrea de Gállego, and Zuera, besieging Zaragoza itself by the end of May.  On [[18 December], it fell and the forces of Alfonso occupied the Azuda, the government tower.  The great palace of the city was given to the monks of Bernard.  Promptly, the city was made Alfonso's capital.  Two years later, in [[1120]], he defeated a Moslem army intent on reconquering his new capital at [[Cutanda]]. He promulgated the ''fuero'' of ''tortum per tortum'', facilitating taking the law into one's own hands, and forced the Moslem population of the city (greater than 20,000) to move to the suburbs.  

In [[1119]], he retook Cervera, Tudejen, Castellón, Tarazona, Ágreda, Magallón, Borja, Alagón, Novillas, Mallén, Rueda, Épila and repopulated the region of [[Soria]].  He began the siege of [[Calatayud]], but left to defeat the army at Cutanda trying to retake Zaragoza.  When Calatayud fell, he took Bubierca, Alhama de Aragón, Ariza, and Daroca (1120).  In [[1123]], he besieged and took [[Lérida]], which was in the hands of the [[count of Barcelona]].  From the winter of [[1124]] to September [[1125]], he was on a risky expedition to Peña Cadiella deep in Andalusia.  

In the great raid of 1125, he carried away a large part of the subject Christians from Granada, and in the south-west of France, he had claims as usurper-king of Navarre.  From 1125 to [[1126]], he was on campaign against [[Granada]], where he was trying to install a Christian prince, and [[Córdoba]], where got only as far as Motril.  In [[1127]], he reconquered Longares, but simultaneously lost all his Castilian possessions to [[alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]].  He confirmed a treaty with Castile the next year ([[1128]]) at [[Támara]] which fixed the boundaries of the two realms.  

He conquered Molina de Aragón and repopulated Monzón in [[1129]], before besieging [[Valencia]], which had falled again upon the Cid's death.  

He went north of the Pyrenees in October [[1130]] to protect the [[Val d'Aran]].  Early in [[1131]], he besieged [[Bayonne]].  It is said he ruled &quot;from Belorado to Pallars and from Bayonne to Monreal.&quot; 

Three years before his death, he made a will leaving his kingdom to the [[Templars]], the [[Hospitallers]], and the Knights of the [[Holy Sepulchre]], which his subjects refused to carry out—instead bringing his brother Ramiro from the monastery to assume royal powers. 

His final campaigns were against Mequinenza ([[1133]]) and Fraga (1134), where [[García VI of Navarre|García Ramírez]], the future king of Navarre, and a mere 500 other knights fought with him.  It fell on [[17 July]]. He was dead by September. Alfonso was a fierce, violent man, a soldier and nothing else, whose piety was wholly militant. He has a great role in the Spanish reconquest.

==Death==

His testament was not honored: Aragon took his aged brother abbot-bishop Ramiro out of monastery and made him king; [[Navarrese]] regained independence and put Lord Garcia Ramirez of [[Monzon, Spain|Monzón]], son of his second cousin, to the throne in [[Pamplona]].

'''''Amaryllis''''' is a monotypic [[genus]] of plant containing one species, the '''Belladonna Lily''' (''Amaryllis belladonna''), a native of [[South Africa]]. ['''Note:''' [[Hippeastrum]] is the flowering bulb commonly sold in November and December for blooming inside]

The Belladonna Lily is a [[bulb]] plant, with each bulb being 5-10 cm in diameter. It has several strap-shaped, dull green [[leaf|leaves]], 30-50 cm long and 2-3 cm broad, arranged in two rows. The leaves are produced in the autumn and eventually die down by late spring. The bulb is then dormant until late summer. 

In late summer the bulb produces one or two naked stems 30-60 cm tall, each of which bear a cluster of 2 to 12 funnel-shaped [[flower]]s at their tops. Each flower is 6-10 cm diameter with six [[tepal]]s (three outer sepals, three inner petals, with similar appearance to each other), white, pink or purple in colour. This flowering pattern is the cause of its common name 'naked lady'. The scientific name ''Amaryllis'' is named after a shepherdess in one of [[Virgil]]'s pastorals, and means any young rustic maiden.

The Belladonna Lily was introduced into cultivation at the beginning of the [[18th century]]. However, most of the so-called Amaryllis bulbs sold as 'ready to bloom for the holidays' belong to the allied genus ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', despite being labeled as 'Amaryllis' by sellers and [[nursery (horticulture)|nurseries]]. Adding to the name confusion, some bulbs of other species with a similar growth and flowering pattern are also sometimes called 'naked ladies', even though those species have their own more widely used and accepted common names, such as the [[Resurrection Lily]] (''Lycoris squamigera'').

'''Alfons''' or '''Alfonso III of Aragon''' ([[1265]] &amp;ndash; [[June 18]], [[1291]], also '''Alfons II of Barcelona'''), surnamed ''the Liberal'', was the king of
[[Aragon]] and count of [[Barcelona]] from [[1285]] to [[1291]].

He was a son of [[Peter III of Aragon]] and his [[Queen consort]] Constance of Sicily, daughter and heiress of [[Manfred of Sicily]]. His maternal grandmother Beatrice of Savoy was a daughter of [[Amadeus IV of Savoy]] and Anne of Burgundy.

He conquered the island of [[Minorca]] in [[1287]].

His inability to resist the demands of his nobles left a heritage of trouble in Aragon.  By recognising their right to rebel in the articles called the [[Union of Aragon]] he helped to make anarchy permanent.

For this reason, probably, [[Dante Alighieri]], in [[the Divine Comedy]], recounts that he saw Alfonso's spirit seated outside the gates of [[Purgatory]] with the other monarchs whom Dante blamed for the chaotic political state of [[Europe]] during the [[13th century]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alfonso IV of Aragon''', surnamed ''the Kind''  ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Alfons el Benigne'')  was the king of
[[Aragon]] and count of [[Barcelona]] (as Alfonso III) from [[1327]] to [[1336]]. Born in [[1299]] and died [[January 24]] [[1336]], he was the second son of [[James II of Aragon]] and [[Blanche of Anjou]].

He became heir after his older brother James renounced his rights to become a monk. He married Teresa of Entença and Antillon (1300-1327), heiress of [[Urgell]]. With this marriage, Urgell was definitively incorporated into the crown of Aragon. 

After widowing, he married Leonor de Castile, who should have been his brother James' wife but he refused to consummate the marriage. She was the sister of [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] and was murdered by her nephew [[Peter I of Castile]].

* Fadrique (died young).
* Constança (1322-1346), married [[James III of Majorca]].
* Elizabeth (died young).
* Sanç (1327, lived only a few days).

'''Amasis II''' (also '''Ahmose II''') was a [[pharaoh]] ([[570 BC]]-[[526 BC]]) of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt]], the successor of [[Apries]]. His capital was at [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]]. He was the last great ruler of [[Egypt]] before the [[Iran|Persia]]n conquest.

Most of our information about him is derived from [[Herodotus]] (2.161ff) and can only be imperfectly verified by monumental evidence. According to the Greek historian, he was of common origins. A revolt of the native soldiers gave him his opportunity. These troops, returning home from a disastrous expedition to [[Cyrene (city)|Cyrene]], suspected that they had been betrayed in order that [[Apries]], the reigning king, might rule more absolutely by means of his [[mercenaries]], and their friends in Egypt fully sympathized with them. Amasis, sent to meet them and quell the revolt, was proclaimed king by the rebels, and Apries, who had now to rely entirely on his mercenaries, was defeated and taken prisoner in the ensuing conflict at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]; the [[usurper]] treated the captive prince with great leniency, but was eventually persuaded to give him up to the people, by whom he was strangled and buried in his ancestral tomb at Sais. An inscription confirms the fact of the struggle between the native and the foreign soldiery, and proves that Apries was killed and honourably buried in the 3rd year of Amasis.

Although Amasis thus appears first as champion of the disparaged native, he had the good sense to cultivate the friendship of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek world]], and brought Egypt into closer touch with it than ever before. Herodotus relates that under his prudent administration [[Egypt]] reached the highest pitch of prosperity; he adorned the temples of [[Lower Egypt]] especially with splendid [[monolith]]ic [[shrine]]s and other monuments (his activity here is proved by remains still existing). To the Greeks, Amasis assigned the commercial colony of [[Naucratis]] on the [[Canopic]] branch of the [[Nile]], and when the [[temple of Delphi]] was burnt he contributed 1,000 [[talent (weight)|talents]] to the rebuilding. He also married a Greek princess named '''Ladice''', the daughter of [[Battus]], king of Cyrene, and he made alliances with [[Polycrates of Samos]] and [[Croesus of Lydia]].

His kingdom consisted probably of Egypt only, as far as the [[First Cataract]], but to this he added [[Cyprus]], and his influence was great in Cyrene. At the beginning of his long reign, before the death of Apries, he appears to have sustained an attack by [[Nebuchadrezzar II]] ([[568 BC]]). [[Cyrus II of Persia|Cyrus]] left Egypt unmolested; but the last years of Amasis were disturbed by the threatened invasion of [[Cambyses]] and by the rupture of the alliance with Polycrates of Samos. The blow fell upon his son [[Psammetichus III]], whom the Persian deprived of his kingdom after a reign of only six months.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alfons V of Aragon''' (also '''Alfons I of Naples''') ([[1396]] &amp;ndash; [[June 27]], [[1458]]), surnamed ''the Magnanimous'', was the [[Kings of Aragon|King]] of [[Aragon]] and [[Naples]] and count of [[Barcelona]] from [[1416]] to [[1458]]. He was a son of [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]] (also called Ferdinand of Antequera), and is one of the most conspicuous figures of the early [[Renaissance]].

He represented the old line of the counts of Barcelona only through women, and was on his father's side descended from the House of Trastamara, a noble family of [[Castile]]. By hereditary right he was king of [[Sicily]]. He disputed the island of [[Sardinia]] with [[Genoa]] and conquered the [[kingdom of Naples]]. He fought and triumphed amid the exuberant development of individuality which accompanied the revival of learning and the birth of the modern world. 

When he was a prisoner in the hands of [[Visconti|Filippo Maria Visconti]], Duke of [[Milan]], in [[1435]], Alfonso persuaded his ferocious and crafty captor to let him go by making it plain that it was the interest of Milan not to prevent the victory of the Aragonese party in Naples.  

Like a true prince of the Renaissance he favoured men of letters whom he trusted to preserve his reputation to posterity.  His devotion to the [[classics]] was exceptional even in that time. For example, Alfonso halted his army in pious respect before the birthplace of a Latin writer, carried Livy or Caesar on his campaigns with him, and his panegyrist [[Panormita]] did not think it an incredible lie to say that the king was cured of an illness when a few pages of [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]]' history of [[Alexander the Great]] were read to him.  However, the classics had not refined his taste, for he was amused by setting iternant scholars, who swarmed to his court, to abuse one another in the indescribably filthy Latin scolding matches which were then the fashion.  

Alfons founded nothing, and, after his conquest of [[Naples]] in [[1441]], ruled by his mercenary soldiers and no less mercenary men of letters.  His Spanish possessions were ruled for him by his brother [[Juan II of Aragon|John]].  He left his conquest of Naples to his bastard son [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand]]; his inherited lands, Sicily and [[Sardinia]], going to his brother John, who survived him.

Alfons was the object of diplomatic contacts from the empire of [[Ethiopia]]. In [[1428]], he received a letter from [[Yeshaq I of Ethiopia]], borne by two dignitaries, which proposed an alliance against the [[Muslim]]s and would be sealed by a dual marriage,  that would require the Infante Don Pedro to bring a group of artisans to Ethiopia, where he would marry Yashq's daughter. It is not clear how or if Alfonso responded to this letter, although in a letter sent to Yeshaq's successor [[Zara Yaqob]] in [[1450]], Alfons wrote that he would be happy to send artisans to Ethiopia, if their safe arrival could be guaranteed for on a previous occasion a party of 13 of his subjects travelling to Ethiopia had all perished. &lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;

He was betrothed to [[María de Castilla]] ([[1401]]&amp;ndash;[[1458]]; sister of [[Juan II of Castile]]) in [[Valladolid]] in 1408; the marriage was celebrated in [[Valencia]] during [[1415]]. They failed to produce children.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amathus''' was an ancient city of [[Cyprus]], on the southern coast, about 24 miles west of [[Larnaka]] and 6 miles east of [[Limassol]]. It lies among sandy hills and sand-dunes, which perhaps explain its name in Greek (''amathos'', sand). Being one of the most ancient royal cities, according to the legend, was settled by one of the sons of [[Heracles]], who was worshipped there. According to other legends, [[Ariadne]], the beautiful daughter of Minos, who fled from [[Labyrinth]] in [[Crete]] with [[Theseus]], was later abandoned in Amathus. She died there while giving birth to her child and was buried in a sacred tomb.

Amathus was built on the coastal cliffs with an amazing view to the sea. It flourished and became a rich kingdom since the early years of its settlement. During the Post Phoenician Era (800 B.C.) a port was also constructed there, which served the trade with the [[Greeks]] and the Levantines. High on the cliff a temple was built, which became a special worship site to Aphrodite, the goddess of Beauty and Love. The excavators discovered the Temple of Aphrodite, which dates approximately to the first century B.C.. According to the legend, it was where Adonia took place, in which athletes competed in hunting wild boars during sport competitions. They also competed in dancing and singing to the honour of Adonis. 

The earliest remains hitherto found on the site are tombs of the early [[Iron Age]] period of Graeco-Phoenician influences ([[1000 BC|1000]]-[[600 BC|600 B.C.]]). Amathus is identified by some (E. Oberhummer, ''Die Insel Cypern'', i., 1902, pp. 13-14; but see [[Citium]]) with Kartihadasti (Phoenician &quot;New-Town&quot;) in the Cypriote tribute-list of [[Esarhaddon]] of [[Assyria]] (668 B.C.). It certainly maintained strong [[Phoenicia]]n sympathies, for it was its refusal to join the phil-Hellene league of [[Onesilos of Salamis]] which provoked the revolt of Cyprus from [[Iran|Persia]] in [[500 BC|500]]-[[494BC|494 B.C]]. (Herod. v. 105), when Amathus was besieged unsuccessfully and avenged itself by the capture and execution of Onesilos.

The phil-Hellene [[Evagoras]] of Salamis was similarly opposed by Amathus about 385-380 B.C. in conjunction with [[Citium]] and [[Soli, Cyprus|Soli]] (Diod.  Sic. xiv. 98); and even after [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] the city resisted annexation, and was bound over to give hostages to [[Seleucus]] (Diod.  Sic. xix. 62).
Its political importance now ended, but its temple of [[Adonis]] and [[Aphrodite]] (Venus Amathusia) remained famous in [[Roman Empire|Roman time]]. 

The wealth of Amathus was derived partly from its corn ([[Strabo]] 340, quoting [[Hipponax]], fi. 540 B.C.), partly from its [[copper]] mines (Ovid, ''Met.'' x. 220, 531), of which traces can be seen inland (G. Mariti, i. 187; L. Ross, ''Inselreise,'' iv. 195; W. H. Engel, ''Kypros,'' i. 111 ff.).
[[Ovid]] also mentions its sheep (Met. x. 227); the epithet ''Amathusia'' in Roman poetry often means little more than &quot;Cypriote,&quot; attesting however the fame of the city.


Amathus was a rich and densely populated kingdom with a flourishing agriculture and mines situated very close northeast Kalavasos. In the Roman Era it became the capital of one out of the four (4) administrative regions. Later, in the 4th century A.D. it became the Episcopal See and continued to flourish until the [[Byzantine]] Period. At approximately the Late 6th century A.D., Ayios Ioannis Eleimonas (Saint John Charitable), protector of the knights was born in Amathus. 

Until 1191 when Richard the Lionheart arrived in Cyprus, Amathus had declined. The tombs were plundered and the stones from the beautiful edifices were brought to Limassol to be used for new constructions. Much later, in [[1869]], a great number of blocks of stone from Amathus were used for the construction of the [[Suez Canal]]. 

Amathus still flourished and produced a distinguished patriarch of [[Alexandria]] ([[St. John the Merciful]]), as late as 606-616, and a ruined [[Byzantian Empire|Byzantine]] church marks the site; but it was already almost deserted when [[Richard I of England|Richard Plantagenet]] won Cyprus by a victory there over [[Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus|Isaac Comnenus]] in 1191.

A new settlement close to Amathus but further inland was created, and named after St Tykhon, a bishop of Amathus. The land were the ruins are is within the borders of this village, though the expansion of the Limassol tourist area has threatened the ruins (it is speculated that some of the hotels are on top of the Amathus necropolis).

Archaeological excavations in the area by parties of Cypriots and French archaeologists started in 1980 and continue until today. The Acropolis, the Aphrodite’s Temple, the market, the city’s walls, the Basicila and the port have all been excavated. 

It is an amazing opportunity for the visitor to ramble over the area and have the feeling of living as they used to live. The visitors have a wonderful chance to explore the area and see rare and beautiful archaeological treasures, which are buried in the soil for centuries. 

In the market there are marvellous marble columns decorated with spiral ornaments and huge paved precincts. At the coastal side of the city there are indications of an Early Christian Basilica with floors decorated with precious gems. Farther, near the terraced road leading to the Temple, situated on the top of the cliff, several houses built in a row dating to the Hellenistic Period have been discovered. In the east and west extremes of the city the two acropolis are situated, where a number of tombs have been found, many of which are intact. 


The rich [[necropolis]], already partly plundered then, has yielded valuable works of art to New York and to the [[British Museum]]; but the city has vanished, except fragments of wall and of a great stone cistern on the acropolis. A similar vessel was transported to the [[Louvre]] in 1867. You might admire many of the interesting hand-made items with an archaeological value, which have been found during the excavations and are actually exposed at the Cyprus Museum in Nicosia as well as at the Limassol District Archaeological Museum or even at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|New York Metropolitan Museum]]. The biggest treasure of Amathus is exposed at Paris Louvre Museum. It is a dim made from limestone, which dates to the 6th century B.C. It is 1.85 m. high and weighs 14 tons. It was made from a single big stone and has four (4) curved handles decorated with the head of a bull. It was used for storing the must from the grapes, which after the fermentation it became wine, which Cyprus is famous for. 

Two small sanctuaries, with terracotta votive offerings of Graeco-Phoenician age, lie not far off, but the great shrine of Adonis and Aphrodite has not been identified (M. Ohnefalsch-Richter, ''Kypros,'' i. ch.1).

The ruins of Amathus are less well-preserved than neighbouring [[Kourion]].

'''Amati''' is the name of a family of [[Italy|Italian]] [[violin]]-makers, who flourished at [[Cremona]] from about [[1550]] to [[1740]]. 

'''Andrea Amati''' (before  1511 &amp;ndash; before 1580) was the first maker of violins whose instruments still survive today. Indeed he seems more or less responsible for giving the instruments of the modern violin family their definitive profile. A small number of his instruments survive, dated between the years of 1564 and 1574 and most bearing the coat of arms of [[Charles IX of France]]. 

Andrea Amati was succeeded by his sons '''Antonio Amati''' (born c. 1540) and '''Girolamo Amati''' ([[1561]] &amp;ndash; [[1630]]). The &quot;brothers Amati&quot;, as they were known, implemented far-reaching innovations in design, including the perfection of the shape of the soundhole. They are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of [[viola]] (rather than the older tenor violas).

'''Nicolo Amati''' ([[December 3]], [[1596]] &amp;ndash; [[April 12]], [[1684]]) was the son of Girolamo Amati. He was the most eminent of the family. He improved the model adopted by the rest of the Amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of [[tone]]. His pattern was usually small, but he also made a wider model now known as the &quot;Grand Amati&quot;, which have become his most sought-after violins. 

Of his pupils the most famous were [[Antonio Stradivari]], Andrea [[Guarneri]] (the first of the Guarneri family of violin makers), and [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] (the inventor of the [[piano|pianoforte]]). 

The last maker of the family was Nicolo's son, Girolamo Amati, known as '''Hieronymus II''' ([[February 26]], [[1649]] &amp;ndash; [[February 21]], [[1740]]). Although he improved on the arching of his father's instruments, by and large they are inferior and no match for the greatest maker of his day, Antonio Stradivari.

      <comment>/* Modern depiction of Amazons */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dablink|This article is about the Amazon women of Greek mythology and similar cases. For other uses, see [[Amazons (disambiguation)]].}}

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''{{polytonic|Ἀμαζόνες}}, Amazons''' were either an ancient legendary nation of female warriors or a land dominated by women at the outer edges of their known world. The legends appear to have a nugget of factual basis in warrior women among the [[Scythia]]ns, but classical Greeks never ceased to be astounded at such role-reversals. Women in classical Greek society were expected to be passive and dependent on males.  In early modern usage, the word was often used to refer to strong and independent women, in contrast to conventional stereotypes of women as weak and passive (see &quot;[[damsel in distress]]&quot;), but now &quot;amazon&quot; in such contexts has self-ironic overtones. 

[[Image:1729.jpg|thumb|300px|The unidentified London cartographer, ''ca'' 1770, has placed ''Amazones'' in the north of ''[[Sarmatians|Sarmatia Asiatica]]'', based on Greek literary sources.]]

==Etymology==
The name {{polytonic|Ἀμαζών}} is probably derived from an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[ethnonym]], ''*ha-mazan-'', originally meaning &quot;warriors&quot;. A connected word is probably the [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] gloss {{polytonic|&amp;#7937;μαζακ&amp;#8049;ραν· πολεμε&amp;#8150;ν}} (&quot;to make war&quot;, containing the [[Indo-Iranian]] root ''kar-'' &quot;make&quot; also in  ''[[karma|kar-ma]]'').

The Greek variant of the name was connected by [[popular etymology]] to [[privative a]] + ''mazos'', &quot;without [[breast]]&quot;, connected with an [[aetiological]] tradition that Amazons had their right breast cut off or burnt out, in order that they might be able to use the bow more freely (contemporary Greeks drew the bowstring to the [[sternum]]); there is no indication of this practice in works of art, in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although the right is frequently covered. Other suggested derivations were: ''a-'' (intensive) + ''mazos'', breast, &quot;full-breasted&quot;; ''a'' (privative) and ''masso'', touch, &quot;not touching&quot; (men); ''maza'', a [[Circassian]] word said to signify &quot;moon&quot;, has suggested their connection with the worship of a moon-goddess, perhaps the Asiatic representative of [[Artemis]].

==Amazons of Greek mythology==
[[Image:AmazonBattle.JPG|thumbnail|right|''Amazon Preparing for Battle'' or ''Armed Venus'', by [[Pierre-Eugène-Emile Hébert]].]]
Amazons were said to have lived in [[Pontus]],which is part of modern day Turkey near the shore of the [[Euxine Sea]], where they formed an independent kingdom under the government of a queen, often named [[Hippolyta]] (&quot;she lets her horses loose&quot;). They were supposed to have founded many towns, amongst them [[Izmir|Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Sinope]], [[Paphos]]. According to another account, they originally came to the [[Thermodon]] from the ''Palus Maeotis'' (&quot;Lake Maeotis&quot;, the [[Sea of Azov]]).  

In some versions, no men were permitted to reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the [[Gargareans]], a neighbouring tribe. The male children who were the result of these visits were either put to death or sent back to their fathers; the females were kept and brought up by their mothers, and trained in agricultural pursuits, hunting, and the art of war ([[Strabo]] xi. p. 503).

In the ''[[Iliad]]'', the Amazons were referred to as [[Antianeira]] (&quot;those who fight like men&quot;).  [[Herodotus]] called them [[Androktones]] (&quot;killers of men&quot;).

The Amazons appear in connection with several Greek legends. They invaded [[Lycia]], but were defeated by [[Bellerophon]], who  was sent out against them by [[Iobates]], the king of that country, in the hope that he might meet his death at their hands (''Iliad'', vi. 186). According to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]], Queen [[Myrine]] led them to victory against the [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]], [[Libya]] and much of [[Gorgon]].

They attacked the [[Phrygia]]ns, who were assisted by [[Priam]], then a young man (''Iliad'', iii. 189).  Although in his later years, towards the end of the [[Trojan War]], his old opponents took his side again against the Greeks under their queen [[Penthesilea]], who was slain by [[Achilles]] (Quint.  Smyr. i.; Justin ii. 4; Virgil, Aen. i. 490).  

One of the tasks imposed upon [[Heracles]] by [[Eurystheus]] was to obtain possession of the girdle of the Amazonian queen [[Hippolyte]] (''[[Apollodorus]]'' ii. 5). He was accompanied by his friend [[Theseus]], who carried off the princess [[Antiope (mythology)|Antiope]], sister of Hippolyte, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of [[Attica, Greece|Attica]], in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus.  In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die.  The battle between the Athenians and Amazonians is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, [[amazonomachy]], marble carvings such as from the [[Parthenon]].

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an 
expedition against the island of [[Leuke]], at the mouth of the [[Danube]], where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by [[Thetis]].  The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. [[Pompey]] is said to have found them in the army of [[Mithradates]].

They are heard of in the time of [[Alexander the Great]], when some of the great king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen [[Thalestris]] visiting him and becoming a mother by him. However, several other biographers of Alexander totally dispute the claim, including the highly regarded secondary source, [[Plutarch]]. In his writing he makes mention of when Alexander's secondary naval commander, [[Onesicritus]], was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King [[Lysimachus]] of [[Thrace]] who was on the original expedition, the king smiled at him and said &quot;And where was I, then?&quot;

The Roman writer [[Virgil]]'s character of the [[Volsci|Volscian]] warrior maiden ''Camilla'' in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazonian.

==Scythian origins==

In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. Jeannine Davis-Kimball, a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried, thus lending some credence to the myths about the Amazons. Following the excavation in [[2003]] by Dr. Davis-Kimball, she and Dr. Joachim Burger compared the genetic evidence from the site with the nomadic [[Kazakh]]s, and have found a striking genetic link – verified later by the [[University of Cambridge]]  [http://www.thirteen.org/pressroom/release.php?get=1272]

Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the [[Altai]] region of Siberia, giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales of mounted Amazons, the origin of the story of the Amazons has been the subject of speculation among classics scholars.  In the 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' speculation ranged along the following lines.

While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent.  It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs.  Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Vurtheim (''De Ajacis origine'', [[1907]]), the Amazons were of Greek origin: &quot;all the Amazons were Dianas, as [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]] herself was an Amazon&quot;. It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus &amp;ndash; who in the tasks assigned to them were generally opposed to monsters and beings impossible in themselves, but possible as illustrations of permanent danger and damage &amp;ndash; shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants. 

[[Herodotus]] reported that the [[Sarmatians]]/[[Sauromatians]] were descendants of Amazons and Scythians. Their [[Scythian]]/[[Saka]]/[[Cimmerian]]/[[Gomer]]ian origins are further proved by their origins from [[Thermodon]]'s Scythians who invaded there coming from around the [[Sea of Azov]] and their use of the bow and arrow as their primary weapon as well as fighting on horseback.

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the [[Sagaris]], an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a &quot;manly weapon&quot; should have been invented by a &quot;tribe of women&quot;, but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].

==Amazons in Greek art==

In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as and often associated with battles of Greeks and [[centaurs]].  The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of not unnatural beings.  Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet, the model before the Greek mind having apparently been the goddess Athena.  In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persia]]n &amp;ndash; that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the kidaris.  They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot. They can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Bassae]], now in the [[British Museum]]), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at [[Athens]] it was represented on the shield of the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], on wall-paintings in the [[Theseum]] and in the [[stoa | ''Stoa Poikile'']]. Many of the sculptors of antiquity, including [[Pheidias]], [[Polyclitus]], [[Cresilas]] and [[Phradmon]], executed statues of Amazons; and there are many existing reproductions of these.

==Amazon-like figures in history and folklore==

Armed women have often acted as royal [[bodyguard]]s throughout history. [[Chandragupta Maurya]] ([[322 BC|322]]&amp;ndash;[[298 BC]]), the first [[emperor]] to develop a centralized  state in [[India]], had a personal guard composed of giant Greek women. Female royal guards re-appear 2000 years later in the [[History of India|history of India]] as guards for the [[Nizam]]s of [[Deccan]] and [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]. And on the island of [[Sri Lanka]], the [[Kandy]] royal family had a royal guard of female [[archer]]s. In [[Europe]], [[Celt]]ic and [[Germanic tribes]] often had women fighting with their husbands. [[Tacitus]] tells us that [[Boadicea]] had more women than men in her army.

There is also a woman in the Old Testament, Deborah, who may be one of the first recorded instances of a woman participating in battle. She was a prophetess, a warrior, a leader, and a Judge of Israel, all in one. She correctly predicted that the enemy general, Sisera, who faced Israel at this time would be slain by a woman (the woman who killed him and also received credit for the army's victory was named Jael.) This story is chronicled in Judges.

In [[Scandinavia]], women who did not yet have the responsibility for raising a family could take up arms and live like warriors. They were called [[shieldmaiden]]s and many of them figure in [[Norse mythology]]. One of the most famous shieldmaidens was [[Hervor]] and she figures in the cycle of the magic sword [[Tyrfing]]. The Danish chronicler [[Saxo Grammaticus]] relates that when the Swedish king [[Sigurd Ring]] and the Danish king [[Harald Wartooth]] met at the [[Battle of Bråvalla]], 300 shieldmaidens fought on the Danish side led by Visna. Saxo relates that the shieldmaidens fought with small shields and long swords.  

Similarly, the '''[[Valkyries]]''' of [[Norse mythology]] are minor female deities, who serve [[Odin]]. The name means ''choosers of the slain''.   The valkyries' purpose was to choose the most heroic of those who had died in battle and to carry them off to [[Valhalla]] where they became [[einherjar]]. This was necessary because Odin needed warriors to fight at his side at the preordained battle at the end of the world, [[Ragnarok|Ragnarök]]. 

A legend which may be based on the Greek Amazons appears in the history of [[Bohemia]]. As the story goes, a large band of women, lead by a certain [[Vlasta]], carried on war against the duke of Bohemia, and enslaved or put to death all men who fell into their hands; eventually, they were mercilessly defeated by the duke. In the [[16th century]] the [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Francisco de Orellana|Orellana]] asserted that he had come into conflict with fighting women in [[South America]] on the [[Marañón River]], which was named after them the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] or river of the Amazons, although others derive its name from the Indian amassona (boat-destroyer), applied to the tidal phenomenon known as the &quot;bore&quot;.

The armored warrior maiden (whose gender is often unsuspected) is a frequent character in the European chivalric epic.  The most famous of these female knights is ''Bradamante'' -- daughter of Aymon, sister to the knight [[Renaud de Montauban]] (''Rinaldo'', ''Ranaldo'') and legendary ancestor to the house of [[Este]] -- who is destined to marry the knight ''Ruggiero'' (or ''Rugiero'').  Her adventures are a major element in the Italian [[Renaissance]] epics ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'' by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]] and its continuation ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' by [[Ariosto]].  A similar character is the pagan warrior knight ''Clorinda'' who battles against the Christian crusaders in [[Torquato Tasso]]'s epic ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]''.  The vogue of such female knights in literature would continue though the seventeenth century and inspired not only dramatic recreations but also actual military feats (such as the [[Anne, Duchess of Montpensier|duchess of Montpensier]]'s participation in the [[Fronde]]).

The [[Dahomey Amazons]] were a 6000 strong military unit of [[Dahomey]] (now [[Benin]]) in [[West Africa]] who were active from the [[16th century|16th]] to the late [[19th century]]. They were largely successful in their battles with neighboring kingdoms, and were finally defeated by the [[France|French]]. [[Libya]] has a long history of Amazon women, which probably pre-dates the Greek Amazons. Even today, [[Gadaffi]] is guarded by female soldiers. Other [[Africa]]n ethnic groups who used fighting women were the [[Igbo (people)|Igbo]] and [[Fulani]], who integrated the women into their armies. 

In the kingdom of [[Siam]] in the 19th century, the king had a personal battalion of 400 spear-wielding women. They were chosen from the most beautiful women of the country, and were said to be excellent spear-throwers, though they were regarded as too valuable to be sent to war. Almost all countries have female combatants in their history one time or the other; it is simply the matter of more or less.

Around 400 women secretly took part as soldiers in the [[American Civil War]]. For notable cases of women became soldiers, reference may be made to [[Mary Anne Talbot]] and [[Hannah Snell]].

In the 20th century, the states of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Israel]] took the initiative to train and utilize women for light infantry and other combatant roles.  Although these moves were initially motivated by the shortage of manpower, for example on USSR's western front in WWII, they led the way for the use of female combatants by the U.S. and other western nations.

==Modern depiction of Amazons==

It has been noted that until the 20th century, Amazons were typically depicted in [[literature]] as an alien adversary that threatened the masculinity of heroes.  As such, the typical goal of the heroes has been to defeat and humiliate them as a way of reasserting male superiority.

In the 20th century, Amazons were depicted with increasing sympathy.  Today, the typical depiction of the characters is as an isolated community of powerful and beautiful warriors whom the male heroes are challenged to earn their respect to become valuable allies.  The most famous modern example of an Amazon is the [[superhero]], [[Wonder Woman]].  Amazons were also frequently featured on the ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' and ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'' television series.  [[Robert E. Howard]]'s minor character [[Red Sonja]], who was fleshed out more in the ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' comic books, and subsequently, in her own movie, also owes much to this modern sympathetic treatment of Amazons. An episode of [[Futurama]] had a planet of [[giant (mythology)|giant]] Amazon-like women where the cast gets stranded.  [[Esther Freisner]] has published a series of [[anthology|anthologies]] on the theme of ''Chicks in [[Chainmail]]'', containing humorous takes on Amazon characters by a number of science fiction and fantasy writers.   

The [[comic book]] series ''[[Y: The Last Man]]'', in which every male on Earth is wiped out in a mysterious plague, includes a hyper-feminist [[cult]] called the Daughters of the Amazon, who believe that [[Mother Earth]] cleansed itself of the &quot;aberration&quot; of the Y chromosome.

A [[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers]] episode, ''Planet of the Amazon Women'' features a society composed solely of women, because all men were either killed in war or held as prisoners of war by their enemy.

A [[Star Trek]]: The Next Generation episode features similar women in &quot;Angel One&quot;. These women are large and strong and dominate the smaller, weaker, more servile men. 

[[Zeus, Master of Olympus]], a computer game, features these women under the command of Artemis who is, depending on the scenario/campaign played, are either the player's allies or deadly enemies, since Artemis can either &quot;bless&quot; the game player's leader or &quot;curse&quot; the game player's leader, depending on the scenario/campaign played. Some scenarios also feature ''independent'' amazons, such as the Military 2 scenario and The Labors of Hercules scenario.

A [[Sliders]] Episode depicts women in control of a Earth, due to a germ warfare virus killing most of the men, and causing the survivors to be sterile, and left the women unaffected by it. When the male Sliders were found, they were mistaken for men that
somehow escaped the plague, not knowing that they're aliens from another dimension, which they were.

A [[Stargate SG-1]] episode, Birthright, has the military unit from Earth asking woman warriors on another planet for aid against spaceborne and dimensional enemies.

A [[Thundarr the Barbarian]] episode, ''Attack of the Amazon Women'', depicts warlike women located in 
what was left of Mt. Rushmore. He and his companions defeated a female meglomaniac who had found a
&quot;ancient&quot; nuclear warhead, and intended to use it in her attempt at conquest.

Another computer game, [[Diablo II]], depicts these women in it as a combat class.

In the [[Wheel of Time]] books by [[Robert Jordan]], the [[Aiel]] people have amazon warriors, called ''[[Far Dareis Mai]]'', &quot;Maidens of the Spear&quot;.

In The Television series [[Futurama]] the characters crash-land on a planet called &quot;Amazonia&quot; inhabited by a race of giant women (Amazonians). Episode 5 of Season 3, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama_%28TV_series_-_season_3%29#Amazon_Women_in_the_Moodhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama_%28TV_series_-_season_3%29#Amazon_Women_in_the_Mood  Amazon Women in the Mood]

A [[Outer Limits]] episode, called [[Lithia]] depicts women who have survived all out war, incl. a nuclear attack and a germ warfare attack which killed all men. In this, a man, who was a [[Major]] in the US Military, was cryogenically frozen as part of a experiment before the war broke out, was revived by some women. He found that humanity survived the war, but were all women. Reproduction was carried out by using frozen sperm, but the virus kills male babies.
Due to a social taboo, he was placed BACK into cryogenic stasis. This episode was shown on the [[Sci-Fi]] channel on 3-1-06 @ 3pm EST/EDT, was made in 1998.

==Sources==
About twenty-five hundred years ago, [[Herodotus]] in ''Histories'' in book four records:

110. About the Sauromatai the following tale is told:--When the
Hellenes had fought with the Amazons,--now the Amazons are called by the Scythians /Oiorpata/, which name means in the Hellenic tongue &quot;slayers of men,&quot; for &quot;man&quot; they call /oior/, and /pata/ means &quot;to slay,&quot;--then, as the story goes, the Hellenes, having conquered them in the battle at the Thermodon, were sailing away and conveying with them in three ships as many Amazons as they were able to take prisoners. These in the open sea set upon the men and cast them out of the ships; but they knew nothing about ships, nor how to use rudders or sails or oars, and after they had cast out the men they were driven
about by wave and wind and came to that part of the Maiotian lake
where Cremnoi stands; now Cremnoi is in the land of the free
Scythians. There the Amazons disembarked from their ships and
made their way into the country, and having met first with a troop of
horses feeding they seized them, and mounted upon these they plundered
the property of the Scythians. 

111. The Scythians meanwhile were not
able to understand the matter, for they did not know either their
speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, but were in
wonder as to whence they had come and thought that they were men, of
an age corresponding to their appearance: and finally they fought a
battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession
of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were
women. They took counsel therefore and resolved by no means to go on
trying to kill them, but to send against them the youngest men from
among themselves, making conjecture of the number so as to send just
as many men as there were women. These were told to encamp near them,
and do whatsoever they should do; if however the women should come
after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when
the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan
was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children
born from them. 

112. The young men accordingly were sent out and did
that which had been commanded them: and when the Amazons perceived
that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and
the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the
young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their
horses, and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by
taking booty. 

113. Now the Amazons at midday used to scatter abroad
either one by one or by two together, dispersing to a distance from
one another to ease themselves; and the Scythians also having
perceived this did the same thing: and one of the Scythians came near
to one of those Amazons who were apart by themselves, and she did not
repulse him but allowed him to lie with her: and she could not speak
to him, for they did not understand one another's speech, but she made
signs to him with her hand to come on the following day to the same
place and to bring another with him, signifying to him that there
should be two of them, and that she would bring another with her. The
young man therefore, when he returned, reported this to the others;
and on the next day he came himself to the place and also brought
another, and he found the Amazon awaiting him with another in her
company. Then hearing this the rest of the young men also in their
turn tamed for themselves the remainder of the Amazons; 

114, and after
this they joined their camps and lived together, each man having for
his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first; and the men were
not able to learn the speech of the women, but the women came to
comprehend that of the men. So when they understood one another, the
men spoke to the Amazons as follows: &quot;We have parents and we have
possessions; now therefore let us no longer lead a life of this kind,
but let us go away to the main body of our people and dwell with them;
and we will have you for wives and no others.&quot; They however spoke thus
in reply: &quot;We should not be able to live with your women, for we and
they have not the same customs. We shoot with bows and hurl javelins
and ride horses, but the works of women we never learnt; whereas your
women do none of these things which we said, but stay in the waggons
and work at the works of women, neither going out to the chase nor
anywhither else. We therefore should not be able to live in agreement
with them: but if ye desire to keep us for your wives and to be
thought honest men, go to your parents and obtain from them your share
of the goods, and then let us go and dwell by ourselves.&quot; 

115. The young men agreed and did this; and when they had obtained the share of the goods which belonged to them and had returned back to the Amazons, the women spoke to them as follows: &quot;We are possessed by fear and trembling to think that we must dwell in this place, having not only separated you from your fathers, but also done great damage to your land. Since then ye think it right to have us as your wives, do this together with us,--come and let us remove from this land and pass over the river Tana also&quot;.

116. They crossed over the Tana rising sun for three days' journey from Tana North Wind for three days' journey from the Maiotian lake: and having arrived at the place where they are now settled, they took up their abode there: and from thenceforward the women of the Sauromatai practise their ancient way of living, going out regularly on horseback to the chase both in company with the men and apart from them, and going regularly to war, and wearing the same dress as the men. 

117. And the Sauromatai make use of the Scythian tongue, speaking it barbarously however from the first, since the Amazons did not learn it thoroughly well. As regards marriages their rule is this, that no maiden is married until she has slain a man of their enemies; and some of them even grow old and die before they are married, because they are not able to fulfil the requirement of the law.&quot; [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=180&amp;fk_files=1131]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ambergris''' ('''Ambra grisea''', '''Ambre gris''', '''ambergrease''', or '''grey [[amber]]''') is a solid, fatty, flammable substance of a dull grey or blackish color, with the shades being variegated like [[marble]]. It possesses a peculiar sweet, earthy odour not unlike [[isopropyl alcohol]]. Now largely replaced by synthetics, it is occasionally still used as a [[fixative]] in [[perfumery]].

== Source ==
Ambergris occurs as a [[biliary]] [[concretion]] in the [[intestines]] of the [[sperm whale]], and can be found floating upon the sea, on the sea-coast, or in the sand near the sea-coast.  Because lumps of ambergris with embedded beaks of [[giant squid]] have been found, scientists have theorized that the whale's intestine produces the substance as a means of facilitating the passage of hard, sharp objects that the whale might have inadvertently eaten.  Ambergris can be found in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; on the coasts of [[Brazil]] and [[Madagascar]]; also on the coast of [[Africa]], of the [[East Indies]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]] and the [[Maluku Islands|Molucca islands]]. However, most commercially collected ambergris came from the [[Bahama Islands]], [[New Providence Island|Providence Island]], etc. It is also sometimes found in the [[abdomen]]s of [[whale]]s.

== Physical properties ==
Ambergris is found in lumps of various shapes and sizes, weighing from &amp;frac12; [[ounce|oz]] (14 [[gram|g]]) to 100 or more [[pound (mass)|pound]]s (45 or more [[kilogram|kg]]). When initially expelled by the whale or removed from it, the fatty precursor of ambergris is pale white in colour (sometimes streaked with black), soft in consistency, with a strong fecal smell.  Following months to years of [[photo-degradation]] and [[oxidation]] in the ocean, this precursor gradually hardens, developing a dark grey or black colour, a crusty and waxy texture, and a peculiar odour that is at once sweet, earthy, marine, and animalic. Its smell has been described by many as a vastly richer and smoother version of [[isopropanol]] without its stinging harshness.

In this developed condition, ambergris has a [[specific gravity]] ranging from 0.780 to 0.926. It melts at about 62 [[degree (temperature)|&amp;deg;]][[celsius|C]] to a fatty, yellow resinous-like liquid; and at 100 &amp;deg;C it is volatilized into a white vapour.  It is soluble in [[diethyl ether|ether]], and in volatile and fixed oils. Ambergris is relatively unreactive to [[acid]]. White crystals of a substance called [[ambrein]], which closely resembles [[cholesterol]], can be separated from ambergris by heating raw ambergris in alcohol then allowing the resulting solution to cool.

== Replacement compounds and economics ==
Historically, the primary commercial use of ambergris has been in [[fragrance]] chemistry, although it has also been used for [[medicine|medicinal]] and [[flavoring]] purposes.  Ambergris is one of the most important amber type odorants and is highly sought. However, it is difficult to get a consistent and reliable supply of high quality ambergris. Due to demand for ambergris and its high price, replacement compounds have been sought out by the fragrance industry and chemically [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]].  The most important of these is [[Ambrox]], which has taken its place as the most widely used amber odorant in [[perfume]] manufacture.  The oldest and most commercially significant synthesis of Ambrox is from [[sclareol]] (primarily extracted from [[Clary sage]]), although syntheses have been devised from a variety of other [[secondary metabolites|natural products]], including [[cis-abienol]] and [[thujone]]. Procedures for the microbial production of Ambrox have also been devised.

Depending on its quality, raw ambergris fetches approximately USD$20 per gram. In the [[United States]], possession of any part of an endangered species &amp;mdash; including ambergris that has washed ashore &amp;mdash; is a violation of the [[Endangered Species Act]] of 1978.

==In literature, cinema and music==

'''Ambergris''' is also a fictional city, named for &quot;the most secret and valued part of the whale&quot;, appearing in [[Jeff Vandermeer]]'s books ''[[City of Saints and Madmen]]'' and ''[[Shriek: An Afterword]]''.
The word also appears in [[Ezra Pound]]'s poem ''Portrait d'une Femme''.  Chapters XCI and XCII of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' relate the extraction of ambergris from a deceased sperm whale.

In the 2001 motion picture [[Hannibal (film)|''Hannibal'']], [[Hannibal Lecter|Dr. Lecter's]] secret location in [[Florence, Italy]] was determined after FBI Agent Clarice Starling received a letter from him that was scented with a hand-engineered fragrance containing ambergris.  Agent Starling consulted a team of fragrance industry experts who identified the presence of ambergris by smelling the letter and lamented their inability to work with this substance in the United States due to its prohibition.

'''Ambergris''' is mentioned during the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode [[Three Hundred Big Boys]] when the whale Mooshu is caused to vomit by the rotten fish it ingests when Leela swims with it.

In the [[Encyclopedia Brown]] series of children's detective stories, there is a story called &quot;The Case of Smelly Nellie and the Ambergris&quot;.

There was also a [[rock music|rock band]] called Ambergris, who released one self-titled album in 1970 through [[ABC Records]].

In the [[World of Warcraft]] [[video game]], players occasionally receive an item called Threshadon Ambergris from defeating [[Loch Ness Monster]]-like sea creatures.

'''Ambergris''' is mentioned in ''[[The Far Side of the World]]'',  one of the ''[[Aubrey-Maturin series]]'' novels by [[Patrick O'Brian]].

A whale-sized block of ambergris plays a central role in artist [[Matthew Barney]]'s film ''[[Drawing Restraint 9]]''

Although [[Julius Caesar]] had freed him from paying tribute to the [[Atuatuci]], Ambiorix joined [[Catuvolcus]] (winter, [[54 BC]]) in an uprising against the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] forces under [[Q.

An attack on [[Quintus Cicero]] (brother of the orator), then stationed with a legion in the [[Nervii]]'s territory, failed due to the timely appearance of Caesar.  Ambiorix is said to have found safety across the [[Rhine]], but his fate remains unknown. It is certain that Caesar attempted to capture him, eliminating the Eburones and destroying their land in the process.

A statue of of Ambiorix (actually a 19th century Romantic interpretation of what Ambiorix might have looked like) can be found in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] town of [[Tongeren]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''August Wilhelm Ambros''' ([[November 17]], [[1816]] &amp;ndash; [[June 28]], [[1876]]) was an [[Austrian]] composer and music historian of [[Czech people|Czech]] decent.

He was born at Mýto (''Mauth'') near [[Rokycany]], [[Bohemia]]. His father was a cultured man, and his mother was the sister of [[Raphael Georg Kiesewetter]] ([[1773]]-[[1850]]), the musical archaeologist and collector. Ambros was well-educated in music and the arts, which were his abiding passion. He was, however, destined for the law and an official career in the Austrian civil service, and he occupied various important posts under the ministry of justice, music being an avocation.

From [[1850]] onwards he became well-known as a critic and essay-writer, and in [[1860]] he began working on his magnum opus, his ''History of Music'', which was published at intervals from [[1864]] in five volumes, the last two ([[1878]], [[1882]]) being edited and completed by [[Otto Kade]] and [[Langhaus]]. 

Ambros became professor of the history of music at [[Prague]] in [[1869]].  He was an excellent pianist, and the author of numerous compositions somewhat reminiscent of [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. 

Ambros died at [[Vienna]], Austria at the age of 59.

The '''Amazon River''' (occasionally ''River Amazon''; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Río Amazonas'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Rio Amazonas'') of [[South America]] is [[River lengths|one of the two longest]] [[river]]s on Earth, the other being the [[Nile]] in Africa. The Amazon has by far the greatest total flow of any river, carrying more than the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], [[Nile]], and [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] rivers combined — so while it may not be the ''longest'' river, it is undoubtedly the ''largest''. Its [[drainage area]], called the [[Amazon Basin]], is the largest of any river system.

The quantity of fresh water released to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is enormous: up to 300,000&amp;nbsp;m&amp;sup3; per second in the rainy season. Indeed, the Amazon is responsible for a fifth of the total volume of [[fresh water]] entering the oceans worldwide. It is said that offshore of the mouth of the Amazon [[potable]] water can be drawn from the ocean while still out of sight of the coastline, and the salinity of the ocean is notably lower a hundred miles out to sea.

The main river (which is usually between one and six miles wide) is navigable for large ocean steamers to [[Manaus]], 1,500 km (more than 900 miles) upriver from the mouth.  Smaller ocean vessels of 3,000 tons[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571466/Amazon.html] and 5.5 m (18 ft) [[Draft (nautical)|draft]][http://www.ultramargroup.com/TextosPeru/Per-013.html] can reach as far as [[Iquitos, Peru|Iquitos]], 3,600 km (2,250 miles) from the sea.  Smaller riverboats can reach 780 km (486 mi) higher as far as [[Achual Point]]. Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the [[Pongo de Manseriche]], just above Achual Point.

The Amazon drains an area of some [[1 E12 m²|6,915,000km]]&amp;sup2; (2,722,000 mile&amp;sup2;), or some 40 percent of South America. It gathers its waters from 5 degrees north latitude to 20 degrees south [[latitude]]. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-[[Andes|Andean]] plateau, just a short distance from the [[Pacific Ocean]]; and, after a course of about 6,400 km (4,000 mi) through the interior of [[Peru]] and across [[Brazil]], it enters the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at the [[Equator|equator]].

The Amazon has changed its drainage several times, from westward in the early [[Cenozoic]] to its present eastward locomotion following the uplift of the [[Andes]].

==Source and upper reaches==
[[Image:Amazon_origin_at_Mismi.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The Amazon originates from a cliff at the [[Nevado Mismi]], with a sole sign of a wooden cross.]]

The ultimate source of the Amazon has only recently been firmly established as a stream on a 5,597 metre (18,363 ft) peak called [[Nevado Mismi]] in the Peruvian [[Andes]], roughly 160 km west of Lake [[Titicaca]] and 700 km S.E. of [[Lima, Peru|Lima]].  The mountain was first suggested as the source in [[1971]] but this was not confirmed until [[2001]]. The waters from Nevado Mismi flow into the [[Río Apurímac]] which is a tributary of the [[Ucayali]] which later joins the [[Marañón River|Marañón]] to form the Amazon proper.

After the confluence of [[Río Apurímac]] and [[Ucayali]], the river leaves Andean terrain and is instead surrounded by [[flood plain]]. From this point to the [[Marañón River|Marañón]], some 1,600 km (1,000 mi), the forested banks are just out of water, and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood-line. The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous [[Amazon Rainforest]].

It is the largest rainforest in the world and is of great [[ecological]] significance, as its biomass is capable of absorbing enormous amounts of [[carbon dioxide]]. [[Conservation ethic|Conservation]] of the Amazon Rainforest has been a major issue in recent years.

The rainforest is supported by the extremely wet climate of the Amazon basin.  The Amazon, and its hundreds of tributaries, flow slowly across the landscape, with an extremely shallow gradient sending them towards the sea: [[Manaus]], 1,600 km (1,000 mi) from the [[Atlantic]], is only 44 m (144 ft) above sea level.

The [[biodiversity]] within the rainforest is extraordinary: the region is home to at least 2.5 million insect species, tens of thousands of plants, and some 2,000 birds and mammals. One fifth of all the world's species of birds can be found in the Amazon rainforest.

The diversity of plant species in the Amazon basin is the highest on Earth. Some experts estimate that one square kilometre may contain over 75,000 types of trees and 150,000 species of higher plants. One square kilometre of Amazon rainforest can contain about 90,000 tons of living plants.

==Flooding==
[[Image:Amazon-river-NASA.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A [[NASA]] satellite image of a flooded portion of the river.]]

Seasonal rains give rise to extensive [[floods]] along the course of the Amazon and its tributaries. The average depth of the river in the height of the rainy season is 40 m (120 ft) and the average width can be nearly twenty-five miles. It starts to rise in November, and increases in volume until June, then falls until the end of October. The rise of the [[Negro River|Negro]] branch is not synchronous; the [[rainy season]] does not commence in its valley until February or March. By June it is full, and then it begins to fall with the Amazon. The [[Madeira River|Madeira]] rises and falls two months earlier than the Amazon.

The abundance of water in the Amazon basin is due to the fact that much of this lies in the region below the [[Intertropical convergence zone]], where rainfall is at a maximum.  Also, the basin lies in the [[Trade Wind]] zone, where moisture from the Atlantic is pushed westwards, and eventually forced to rise over the [[Andes]], the second tallest mountain range on Earth, where the moist air cools and precipitates water.  This combination creates more rainfall over a large river basin than anywhere else on the planet.

In the rainy season, the Amazon inundates the country throughout its course to the extent of several hundred thousand square miles, covering the flood-plain, called [[vargem]]. The flood-levels are, in some places, from 12 to 15 m (40 to 50 ft) higher than levels during the dry season. During the flood, the level at [[Iquitos]] is 6 m (20 ft); at [[Teffe]], it is 15 m (45 ft); near [[Óbidos, Pará|Óbidos]], 11 m (35 ft); and at [[Pará]], 4 m (12 ft), above the low-water extreme seen during the dry season.
&lt;br clear=all /&gt;

==Towards the sea==
The breadth of the Amazon in some places is as much as 6 to 10 km (4 to 6 mi) from one bank to the other. At some points, for long distances, the river divides into two main streams with inland and lateral [[channel (geography)|channels]], all connected by a complicated system of natural [[canal]]s, cutting the low, flat igapo lands, which are never more than 5 m (15 ft) above low river, into almost numberless islands.

At the narrows of [[Óbidos, Pará|Óbidos]], 600 km (400 mi) from the sea, the Amazon narrows, flowing in a single streambed, a mile (1.6 km) wide and over 200 ft (60 m). deep, through which the water rushes toward the sea at the speed of 6 to 8 km/h (4 to 5 mph).

From the village of [[Canaria]] at the great bend of the Amazon to the Negro 1,000 km (600 mi) downstream, only very low land is found, resembling that at the mouth of the river. Vast areas of land in this region are submerged at high water, above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear. Near the mouth of the Rio Negro to Serpa, nearly opposite the river Madeira, the banks of the Amazon are low, until approaching Manaus, they rise to become rolling hills. At Óbidos, a bluff 17 m (56 ft) above the river is backed by low hills. The lower Amazon seems to have once been a [[gulf]] of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the waters of which washed the cliffs near Óbidos.

[[Image:Amazon near Manaus.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Amazon near Manaus]]

Only about 10% of the water discharged by the Amazon enters the mighty stream downstream of Óbidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley. The drainage area of the Amazon basin above Óbidos is about 5 million km&amp;sup2; (2 million mile&amp;sup2;), and, below, only about 1 million km&amp;sup2; (400,000 mile&amp;sup2;), or around 20%, exclusive of the 1.4 million km&amp;sup2; (600,000 mile&amp;sup2;) of the Tocantins basin.

In the lower reaches of the river, the north bank consists of a series of steep, table-topped [[hill]]s extending for about 240 km (150 mi) from opposite the mouth of the Xingu as far as [[Monte Alegre]]. These hills are  cut down to a kind of [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] which lies between them and the river. 

Monte Alegre reaches an altitude of several hundred feet. On the south bank, above the Xingu, an almost-unbroken line of low [[bluff]]s bordering the flood-plain extends nearly to Santarem, in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the south-west, and, abutting upon the lower Tapajos, merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the Tapajos river valley.

==Mouth of the river==
[[Image:Amazon-river-delta-NASA.jpg|thumb|250px|A satellite image of the mouth of the Amazon River, looking south]]

The width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from [[Cabo do Norte]] to [[Punto Patijoca]], a distance of some 330 km (207 mi); but this includes the ocean outlet, 60 km (40 mi) wide, of the Para river, which should be deducted, as this stream is only the lower reach of the Tocantins. It also includes the ocean frontage of [[Marajó]], an island about the size of [[Denmark]] lying in the mouth of the Amazon.

==Tidal bore==
Following the coast, a little to the north of Cabo do Norte, and for 160 km (100 miles) along its Guiana margin up the Amazon, is a belt of half-submerged islands and shallow sandbanks. Here the tidal phenomenon called the [[tidal bore|bore]], or ''Pororoca'', occurs, where the depths are not over 4 [[fathom]]s (7 m). The tidal bore starts with a roar, constantly increasing, and advances at the rate of from 15 to 25 km/h (10 to 15 mph), with a breaking wall of water from 1.5 to 4 m (5 to 12 ft) high. The bore is the reason the Amazon does not have a [[river delta|delta]]; the ocean rapidly carries away the vast volume of [[silt]] carried by the Amazon, making it impossible for a delta to grow. It also has a very large tide sometimes reaching 20 feet.

==Wildlife==
The waters of the Amazon support a diverse range of wildlife. Along with the [[Orinoco]], the river is one of the main habitats of the [[Boto]], also known as the Amazon River Dolphin. The largest species of river dolphin, it can grow to lengths of up to 2.6 m.

Also present in large numbers are the notorious [[Piranha]], carnivorous fish which congregate in large schools, and may attack livestock and even humans. Although many experts believe their reputation for ferocity is unwarranted, a school of piranha was apparently responsible for the deaths of up to 300 people when their boat capsized near [[Óbidos, Pará|Óbidos]] in [[1981]].

The [[Anaconda]] snake is found in shallow waters in the Amazon basin. One of the world's largest species of snake, the Anaconda spends most of its time in the water, with just its nostrils above the surface. Anacondas have been known very occasionally to attack fishermen.

The river also supports thousands of species of fish, as well as crabs and turtles.

==European exploration==
The first descent by a European of the Amazon from the [[Andes]] to the sea was made by [[Francisco de Orellana]] in 1541.

The first ascent by a European of the river was made in 1638 by [[Pedro Teixeira]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who reversed the route of Orellana and reached [[Quito]] by way of the [[Napo River|Napo River]]. He returned in 1639 with the two [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] fathers [[Christoval de Acuna|Acuna]] and [[Artieda]], who had been delegated by the viceroy of [[Peru]] to accompany Texeira.

==Name==
Before the conquest of South America, the ''Río de las Amazonas'' had no general name; instead, indigenous peoples had names for the sections of the river they occupied, such as [[Paranaguazu]], [[Guyerma]], [[Solimões]] and others.

In the year 1500, [[Vicente Yañez Pinzon]], in command of a [[Spain|Spanish]] expedition, became the first European to explore the river, exploring its mouth when he discovered that the ocean off the shore was fresh water. Pinzon called the river the ''Rio Santa Maria de la Mar Dulce'', which soon became abbreviated to Mar Dulce, and for some years, after 1502, it was known as the Rio Grande.

Pinzon's companions called the river ''El Río Marañón''. The word Marañón is thought by some to be of indigenous origin. This idea was first stated in a letter from [[Pietro Martire Vermigli|Peter Martyr]] to [[Lope Hurtado de Mendoza]] in 1513. However, the word may also be derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''&quot;maraña&quot;'' &amp;mdash; meaning a tangle, a snarl, which well represents the bewildering difficulties which the earlier explorers met in navigating not only the entrance to the Amazon, but the whole island-bordered, river-cut and indented coast of what is now the Brazilian state of [[Maranhão]].

The name ''Amazon'' arises from a battle which [[Francisco de Orellana]] had with a tribe of [[Tapuya]]s where the women of the tribe fought alongside the men, as was the custom among the entire tribe. Orellana derived the name Amazonas from the ancient [[Amazons]] of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]] described by [[Herodotus]] and [[Diodorus]].

==Exploitation==

For 350 years after the European discovery of the Amazon by Pinzon, the Portuguese portion of its basin remained an almost undisturbed wilderness, occupied by indigenous tribes split into countless fragments by their quest for food. Because of the difficulty of [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] food, the indigenous inhabitants probably had a population density no higher than one person to every 13 km&amp;sup2; (5 sq. miles) of territory.

A few settlements on the banks of the main river and some of its tributaries had been founded by the Portuguese either for trade with the Indians or for evangelizing purposes. The total population of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000, of whom about two-thirds comprised by Europeans and slaves, the slaves amounting to about 25,000.

The principal commercial city, [[Para (city)|Para]], had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves. The town of Manáos, now [[Manaus]], at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had from 1,000 to 1,500 population. All the remaining villages, as far up as [[Tabatinga]], on the Brazilian frontier of Peru, were very small.

On [[September 6]] [[1850]], the emperor, [[Dom Pedro II]], sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the Amazon, and gave Barao Maua ([[Irineu Evangilista de Sousa]]) the task of putting it into effect. He organized the &quot;Compania de Navigacao e Commercio do Amazonas&quot; at Rio de Janeiro in 1852; and in the following year it commenced operations with three small steamers, the ''Monarch'', the ''Marajó'' and ''Rio Negro''.

At first, navigation was principally confined to the main river; and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between Para and Manáos, with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity, a second line to make six round voyages a year between Manaós and Tabatinga, and a third, two trips a month between Para and Cameta. This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.

The success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the Amazon, and a second company soon opened commerce on the Madeira, Purus and Negro; a third established a line between Para and Manáos; and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams. In that same period, the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet. Meanwhile, private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.

On [[July 31]], 1867 the government of Brazil, constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the upper Amazon basin, decreed the opening of the Amazon to all flags; but limited this to certain defined points: Tabatinga&amp;mdash;on the Amazon; Cameta&amp;mdash;on the Tocantins; Santarem&amp;mdash;on the Tapajos; Borba&amp;mdash;on the Madeira and Manáos&amp;mdash;on the Rio Negro. The decree took effect on [[September 7]], 1867.

Manáos (now Manaus), Para and Iquitos are now thriving commercial centres. The first direct foreign trade with Manáos was commenced about 1874. The local trade of the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Company&amp;mdash;the Amazon Steam Navigation Company&amp;mdash;as well as numerous small river steamers, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Purfis and many other streams. The principal exports of the valley were [[Rubber|india-rubber]], [[cacao]], [[Brazil nut]]s and a few other products of very minor importance.

==20th century concerns==
Four centuries after the discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than 25 square miles (65 km&amp;sup2;), excluding the limited and rudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters. This situation changed dramatically during the [[20th century]].

[[Image:Manaus-Amazon-NASA.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Manaus]], the largest city on the Amazon, as seen from a [[NASA]] satellite image, surrounded by the muddy Amazon River and the dark [[Negro River]].]]

Wary of foreign exploitation of the nation's resources, Brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior, away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land. The original architect of this expansion was President [[Getúlio Vargas]], the demand for rubber from the Allied forces in [[World War II]] providing funding for the drive.

The construction of the new capital [[Brasilia]] in the interior in [[1960]] also contributed to the opening up of the Amazon basin. A large scale colonization program saw families from north-eastern Brazil relocated to the forests, encouraged by promises of cheap land. Many settlements grew along the road from Brasilia to [[Belem]], but rainforest soil proved difficult to cultivate.

Still, long-term development plans continued. Roads were cut through the forests, and in 1970, the work on Trans-Amazon highway network began. The network's three pioneering highways were completed within ten years, connecting all the major cities of the Brazilian Amazon interior.

Cattle farming became a major impetus in [[deforestation]], with military governments in the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]] heavily subsidising the creation of large ranches. By the [[1980s]] the rate of destruction of the rainforest was dizzying, and it is estimated that over a fifth of the total area of the rainforest has now been [[clearcut]]. The preservation of the remaining forest is becoming an ever more prominent concern.
