The '''Apple I''' was an early [[personal computer]], and the first to combine a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] with  a [[microprocessor]] and a connection to a [[computer display|monitor]].

The Apple I was designed by [[Steve Wozniak]] originally for personal use. Wozniak's friend [[Steve Jobs]] had the idea of selling the computer. It was sold as Apple's first product, beginning in April 1976. Its retail price was US$666.66. About 200 units were produced. Unlike other hobbyist computers of its day, which were sold as kits, the Apple I was a fully-assembled circuit board containing about 30 chips. However, to make a working computer, users still had to add a case, power supply, keyboard, and display. An optional board providing a cassette interface for storage was later released at a cost of $75.

The Apple I is sometimes credited as the first personal computer to be sold in fully assembled form; however, some argue that the honour rightfully belongs to other machines, such as the [[Datapoint 2200]].

The Apple I's use of a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[computer display|monitor]] was distinctive. Competing machines such as the [[Altair 8800]] generally were programmed with front-mounted toggle switches and used indicator lights (red [[light-emitting diode|LED]]s, most commonly) for output, and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to keyboards and monitors. This made the Apple I an innovative machine for its day, despite its lack of graphics or sound capabilities. It was discontinued in March 1977, when it was replaced with the [[Apple II]].

As of the [[as of 2005|turn of the millennium]], an estimated 30 to 50 Apple Is are still known to exist, making it a [[collector's item]]. An Apple I reportedly sold for $50,000 at auction in 1999; however, a more typical price for an Apple I is in the $14,000&amp;ndash;$16,000 range. A software-compatible clone of the Apple I ([[Replica I]]) produced using modern components, was released in 2003 at a price of around $200.

'''''Apatosaurus''''' (ah-PAT-o-sawr-us) meaning &quot;deceptive lizard&quot;, because its [[Chevron (anatomy)|chevron bones]] were like those of ''[[Mosasaurus]]'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''apatelos'' = deceptive + ''sauros'' = lizard), often refered to as ''[[Brontosaurus]]'', is a [[genus]] of [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]]s that lived about 140 [[million years ago]], during the [[Jurassic]] [[geologic period|period]]. They were some of the largest land [[animal]]s that ever existed, about 4.5 [[metre]]s (15 [[feet]]) tall at the hips, with a length of up to 25m (80 feet) and a mass up to 35 [[metric tonne]]s (40 [[short ton|ton]]s).

The cervical vertebra and the bones in the legs were bigger and heavier than that of [[Diplodocus]], but they both had the long neck and tail. The skull was first identified in [[1975]], a century after it got its name. ''Apatosaurus'' had a large claw on its first digit (thumb). The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. 

==Environment==

Early on, it was believed that ''Apatosaurus'' was too massive to support its own weight on dry land, so it was theorized that the sauropod must have lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in a swamp. Recent findings do not support this. In fact, like its relative ''[[Diplodocus]]'', ''Apatosaurus'' was a [[grazing]] animal with a very long neck, and a long tail that served as a counterweight. Fossilized footprints indicate that it probably lived in herds. To aid in processing food, ''Apatosaurus'' may have swallowed gizzard stones ([[gastrolith]]s) the same way many birds do today &amp;mdash; its jaws alone were not sufficient to chew tough plant fibers.

''Apatosaurus'' perhaps lumbered along in flocks on riverbanks with trees, eating off the top leaves. Scientists believe that these sauropods could not raise their neck to an angle of 90 degrees, as doing so would slow blood flow to the brain excessively; blood starting at the body proper would take two or more minutes to reach the brain. Furthermore, studies of the structure of the neck vertebrae have revealed that the neck was not as flexible as previously thought. No one knows how Apatosaurs ate enough food to satisfy their enormous bodies. They probably ate constantly, pausing only to cool off, drink or to remove parasites. They must have slept standing upright. If attacked by a predator, one could defend itself by swinging its tail from side to side, or stomping on the meat-eater.

==Classification and history==

[[Image:Apatosaurus2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Apatosaurus' correct head]]
In 1877, [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] published notes on his discovery of ''Apatosaurus ajax'', and then in 1879 described another, more complete dinosaur species, which he speculated to represent a new genus and named ''Brontosaurus excelsus''. In 1903, it was discovered that ''Brontosaurus excelsus'' was in fact an adult ''Apatosaurus'', and the name ''Apatosaurus'', having been published first, was deemed to have priority as the official name; ''Brontosaurus'' was relegated to being a synonym. In the 1970s, it was proven that the traditional &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; image known to all was, in fact, an ''Apatosaurus excelsus'' with a ''[[Camarasaurus]]'' head mistakenly placed on its body.

Fossils of this animal have been found in Nine Mile Quarry and Bone Cabin Quarry in [[Wyoming]], and at sites in [[Colorado]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Utah]], [[United States|USA]].

===Species===

* ''A. ajax'' is the [[type species]] of the genera, and was named by the [[paleontologist]] [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in 1877 after [[Telamonian Aias|Ajax]], the [[hero]] from [[Greek mythology]]. It is the [[holotype]] for the genera, and two partial skeletons have been found including part of a [[skull]].
* ''A. excelsus'' (originally ''Brontosaurus'') was named by Marsh in 1879. It is known from six partial skeletons, including part of a skull, which have been found in the [[United States]], in [[Oklahoma]], [[Utah]], and [[Wyoming]].
* ''A. louisae'' was named by [[William Holland]], in 1915. It is known from one partial skeleton, which was found in [[Colorado]], in the United States.

[[Robert T. Bakker]] made ''A. yahnahpin'' the [[holotype|type]] species of a new genus, ''Eobrontosaurus'' in 1998, so it is now properly ''Eobrontosaurus yahnahpin''. It was named by Filla, James and Redman in 1994. One partial skeleton has been found in Wyoming.

Allosaurus was a huge carnivore. Allosaurus probably ate herbivore dinosaurs, like stegosaurs and iguanadons. It could kill medium-sized sauropods, and sick or injured large saurpods like apatosaurs and others of its kind. Allosaurus may have been a scavenger. Allosaurus probably had competition with Ceratosaurus, though Allosaurus was much larger.
	Bones of big sauropods, like Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Apatosaurus have Allosaurus tooth marks. A huge sauropod was most likely to big for even one Allosaurus to kill, so scientists think Allosuarus probably hunted in packs to kill such big Plant-eaters. But maybe Allosaurus couldâve only gone after injured or sick dinosaurs, not risking being killed by a strong and healthy Sauropod, or a whack of a tail.
	A recent study found that Allosaurusâ powerful bite was not in the musles of its jaws, but its neck and reinforced skull. It would gape and cleave flesh from its prey by using its powerfully-muscled neck to wield its impact-resistant skull like an axe. This would have done far more damage than simply opening and closing its jaws.
	Allosaurus was a Carnosaur, and his intelligence was high. His EQ ( Enephalization Quotient, or how its brain measured to its body) was about 1.9 EQ.
	In 1998, a Allosaurus nest was discovered in Wyoming. Fossils of adults and young were found, along with tons of Herbivore bones. The bones had teeth marks from young and from grown Allosaurs. This shows that Allosaurs may have brought food back to the nests to feed to their young.
	Itâs not determined that Allosaurs were able to communicate vocally besides a hiss. But because their closest living relatives, birds and crocodiles can, it probably means Allosaurus could too. Itâs certain that Allosaurus used visual communication some what. The crest on its head is proof of this. Its crest was probably colorful. Communicating by bobbing the head was probably part of courting and telling of enemies. Showing its massive teeth was probably another way of warding of threats.
	During the Mesozoic era, the climate was warmer, the seasons were mild, the sea level was higher, and there was no polar ice.  In the mid-Jurassic, Laurasia and Gondwanaland started forming because Pangaea was breaking apart. By the late Jurassic, the spreading of Laurasia and Gondwanaland was almost complete. The climate of the Jurassic period was hot and dry, but later
changed, with no polar ice, warm and moist, and very much flooding in vast areas. Pterosaurs starting flying in the sky.
	The seas during the Jurassic period were home to tons of coral reefs, fish, ichthyosaurs, (fishlike reptiles), plesiosaurs, giant marine crocodiles, ammonites, squid, sharks, and rays.
	Triassic plant lines continued. Many palm-like trees, called Cycads were around. There was also many seed ferns, gingkos, and conifers in the subtropical forests.
	So far, more than sixty complete and partial Allosaurus skeletons have been found. Theyâve been found in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Montana, South Dakota, Oklahoma, and possibly Portugal and Tanzania.
In one quarry here in Utah, remains of at least 44 Allosaurs were found mixed together! The teeth of Allosaurus are the most common remains of theropods from the late Jurassic in the American West.
	In 1991 a 95% complete Allosaurus skeleton was found, and was later named Big Al. the skeleton was excavated near Shell, Wyoming by the Museum of the Rockies and the University of Wyoming Geological Museum. It was originally discovered by a Swiss team led by Kirby Siber. They later found a second Allosaurus, named âBig Al Twoâ. Itâs the best preserved skeleton of Allosaurus yet.

'''''Allosaurus''''' (AL-oh-sore-us) meaning âdifferent lizardâ, because its [[vertebrae]] were different from those of all other dinosaurs ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''allos'' = different + ''sauros'' = lizard), was a large [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[dinosaur]] with a length of up to 12&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]] (39&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). It was the most common large predator in [[North America]], 155 to 145 [[million years ago]], in the [[Jurassic]] [[geologic period|period]]. 

''Allosaurus'' is the official [[state fossil]] of [[Utah]], in the [[United States]].

== Description ==
[[Image:Allosaurus1.jpg|thumb|210px|left|A replica Allosaurus skeleton at a New Zealand museum]]
''Allosaurus'' is a classic big [[theropod]]: a large [[skull]] on a short [[neck]], a long [[tail]], and reduced forelimbs. Its most distinctive feature is a pair of blunt horns just above and in front of the eyes. Although short in comparison to the hindlimbs, the forelimbs are massive and bear large, eagle-like [[claw]]s. The skull shows evidence of being composed of separate modules, which could be moved in relation to one another, allowing large pieces of meat to be swallowed. The skeleton of ''Allosaurus'', like other theropods, shows [[bird]]like features like a wishbone and neck vertebrae hollowed by air sacs. It is thought that ''Allosaurus'' might have hunted in packs, allowing it to bring down the large sauropods of the time. Allosaurus was extremely light compared to other dinosaurs its size, which may have allowed it to leap onto its prey (something that only small dinosaurs could do) without sustaining severe injury.

== Findings ==
''Allosaurus'' is the most common theropod in the huge section of dinosaur-bearing rock in the [[American Southwest]] known as the [[Morrison Formation]]. Remains have been recovered in [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], [[South Dakota]], [[Colorado]], [[Oklahoma]], [[New Mexico]], and Utah in the United States; and in [[Portugal]]. Curiously, ''Allosaurus'' shared the Jurassic landscape with several other theropods, including ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'' and the massive ''[[Torvosaurus]]''.

A famous [[fossil]] bed can be found in the [[Cleveland Lloyd Quarry]] in Utah. This fossil bed contains over 10,000 bones, mostly of ''Allosaurus'', with other dinosaurs like ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' and ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'' thrown in. It is still a mystery how the remnants of so many animals can be found in one place: normally the ratio of fossils of carnivorous animals over fossils of plant eaters is very small. Findings like these can be explained by pack hunting, although this is difficult to prove.

One of the more significant finds was the 1991 discovery of &quot;[[Big Al]]&quot; (MOR 593), a 95% complete, partially articulated, juvenile specimen that measured 8 meters (26 feet) in length. Nineteen bones were broken or showed signs of [[infection]], which probably contributed to Big Al's death. It was featured in &quot;The Ballad of Big Al&quot;, a special programme in the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'' series. The fossils were excavated near [[Shell, Wyoming]] by the [[Museum of the Rockies]] and the [[University of Wyoming]] Geological Museum.  This skeleton was initially discovered by a Swiss team led by Kirby Siber, which later excavated a second Allosaurus &quot;Big Al Two&quot;, which is the best preserved skeleton of its kind to date.

== Classification and history ==
[[Image:Allo.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Allosaurus Big Al]]
The first ''Allosaurus'' [[fossil]] to be described was a &quot;petrified [[horse]] hoof&quot; given to [[Ferdinand Vandiveer Hayden]] in [[1869]] by the natives of Middle Park, near [[Granby, Colorado]]. It was actually a caudal [[vertebra]] (a tail bone), which [[Joseph Leidy]] tentatively assigned first to the ''[[Poicilopleuron]]'' [[genus]], and later to a new genus, ''[[Antrodemus]]''. However, it was [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] who gave the formal name ''Allosaurus fragilis'' to the genus and [[type species]] in [[1877]], based on much better material including a partial skeleton, from Garden Park, north of [[Canon City, Colorado]].

The name ''Allosaurus'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''allos'', meaning &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;different&quot;; and ''sauros'', meaning &quot;lizard&quot; or &quot;reptile&quot;. The species epithet ''fragilis'' is [[Latin]] for &quot;fragile&quot;. Both refer to lightening features in the vertebrae.

It is unclear how many species of ''Allosaurus'' there were. The material from the Cleveland-Lloyd ''Allosaurus'' is much smaller and more lightly built than the huge, robust ''Allosaurus'' from [[Brigham Young University]]'s [[Dry Mesa Quarry]]. Fossils resembling ''Allosaurus'' have been described from [[Portugal]].

''Allosaurus'''s closest relative is probably the Lower Cretaceous ''[[Acrocanthosaurus]]''.

The '''AK-47''' ('''''A'''vtomat '''K'''alashnikova 19'''47 '''''; [[Russian language|Russian]]: ÐÐ²ÑÐ¾Ð¼Ð°Ñ ÐÐ°Ð»Ð°ÑÐ½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð²Ð° Ð¾Ð±ÑÐ°Ð·ÑÐ° 1947 Ð³Ð¾Ð´Ð°) is a [[gas-operated]] [[assault rifle]] designed by [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]], produced by [[Russia]]n manufacturer [[IZH]], and used in many [[Eastern bloc]] nations during the [[Cold War]]. It was adopted and standardized in 1947. Compared to [[rifle]]s used in [[World War II]], the AK-47 was generally lighter, more compact, with a shorter range, a smaller [[7.62 x 39 mm|7.62 Ã 39 mm]] cartridge, and was capable of [[selective fire]].  It was one of the first assault rifles, and surely the most prolific. The AK-47 and its numerous variants have been produced in greater numbers than any other assault rifle in the 20th century, and it remains in production to this day.

==Development==
During the Second World War, Germany had developed the concept of the assault rifle.  This concept was based on the premise that most military engagements in modern warfare were happening at fairly close range with the majority happening within 100 meters.  The power and range of âfull-powerâ rifle cartridges was simply overkill for a vast majority of engagements with small arms.  As a result, a cartridge and firearm were sought that would combine the features of a submachinegun (high capacity magazine and fully-automatic capability) with an intermediate power cartridge that would be effective to a range of 300 meters.  For the sake of manufacturing, this was done by shortening the 8 mm Mauser cartridge to 33 mm and using a lighter bullet.

The resulting [[Sturmgewehr 44]] was not the first rifle to use these features; it was preceded by earlier [[Italy|Italian]], and [[Russia]]n, designs.  The Germans were, however, the first to produce and field a sufficient number of the type to properly evaluate its utility.  They fielded the weapon in large numbers against the Russians towards the end of the war.  This experience deeply influenced Russian doctrine in the years following the war.

[[Image:AKlash.jpg|thumb|right|Mikhail Kalashnikov]]According to the story, tank sergeant Mikhail Kalashnikov began imagining his weapon while still in the hospital, after being wounded in the battle of [[Bryansk]]. He had been informed that a new weapon was required for the 7.62 Ã 39 mm cartridge developed by Elisarov and Semin in 1943. Sudayev's [[PPS43]] submachine gun was preferred to Kalashnikov's design. Kalashnikov redesigned his losing design after examining a German [[Sturmgewehr 44|STG 44]] in 1946.  It has been suggested that Kalashnikov was chosen to lead a team of designers more for propaganda value due to his war-hero status rather than for his expertise, following Soviet patterns in other industries.

Despite circumstantial evidence, Mikhail Kalashnikov denies that his rifle was ''based'' on the German assault rifle.  Internally the AK-47 owes much to the [[M1 Garand]] Rifle.  The double locking lugs, unlocking raceway, and trigger mechanism are clearly derived from the earlier American design.  This is not surprising as millions of Garand rifles had operated reliably in combat around the globe.  Though mechanically similar to the Garand, the AK-47 clearly borrows its cartridge concept, weapon layout, gas system, and construction methods from the StG44. Where the Kalashnikov rifle differs is in its simplification of those contributing designs and adaptation to mass production by relatively unskilled labor.  The AK-47 can be seen as a fusion of the best that the M1 Garand offered combined with the best aspects of the StG44 made by the best processes available in the Soviet Union at the time.

There were many difficulties during the initial phase of production.  The first production models had stamped sheet metal receivers. Alarmingly, these rifles were wearing out rapidly.  Instead of halting production, a heavy machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver. This was a more costly process, but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier [[Mosin-Nagant]] rifle's machined receiver were easily adapted. Partly because of these problems, the Soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until 1956.

Once manufacturing difficulties had been overcome, a redesigned version designated the AKM (''M'' for ''modernized'' or ''upgraded'') was introduced in 1959 .  This new model used a stamped sheet metal receiver and featured a slanted device on the end of the barrel to compensate for muzzle rise under recoil.  The AKM was exported around the world to aid in the spread of Communism.  Licensed production of the Kalashnikov weapons abroad as well as unlicensed production was almost exclusively of the AKM. Despite this, rifles of this pattern are almost universally referred to as AK-47's.

In 1978, the Soviet Union began replacing their AK-47 and AKM rifles with a newer design, the [[AK-74]].  This new rifle and cartridge had only started being exported to eastern European nations when the Soviet Union collapsed.

==Notable features==   
The AK-47 is simple and inexpensive to manufacture and easy to clean and maintain. Its ruggedness and reliability is legendary. The large gas piston, generous clearances between moving parts, and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle.  This reliability comes at the cost of accuracy.
    
The notched rear tangent iron sight is calibrated with each numeral denoting hundreds of meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field. Windage adjustment is done by the armory prior to issue. The battle setting places the round within a few centimeters above or below the point of aim out to approximately 250 meters. This &quot;[[point-blank range]]&quot; setting allows the shooter to fire the gun at any close target without adjusting the sights. Longer settings are intended for area suppression. These settings mirror the [[Mosin-Nagant]] and [[SKS]] rifles which the AK-47 replaced. This eased transition and simplified training.   
   
The [[bore]] and [[chamber]], as well as the gas piston and the interior of the [[gas cylinder]], are generally [[chromium]] plated. This plating dramatically increases the life of these parts by resisting corrosion and wear. Chrome plating of critical parts is now common on most modern military weapons.

==Ballistics==
The standard AK-47 or AKM fires a [[7.62 x 39 mm|7.62 Ã 39 mm]] [[cartridge (weaponry)|round]] with a muzzle velocity of 710 m/s (2,329 ft/s). Muzzle energy is 1,990 [[joule]]s (1,467 ftâ¢lbf). Cartridge case length is 38.6 mm, weight is 18.21 g. Projectile weight is normally 8 g (123 gr). The AK-47 and AKM, with the 7.62 Ã 39 mm cartridge, have an effective range of around 300 meters.  For comparison, the [[7.62 x 54 mm R]] cartridge has a projectile of 12 g (185 gr) at a velocity of 818 m/s (2,683 ft/s) for approximately 4,000 joules (2,950 ftâ¢lbf) of energy.

==Operating cycle==
[[Image:AK-components.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A diagram showing the design of AKM.]]

To fire, the operator inserts a loaded [[Magazine (firearm)|magazine]], moves the selector lever to the lowest position, pulls back and releases the charging handle, and then pulls the [[trigger]].  In this setting, the gun fires once requiring the trigger be released and depressed again for the next shot until the magazine is exhausted.  With the selector in the middle position, the rifle continues to fire, automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber, until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger.

Dismantling the gun involves the operator depressing the magazine catch and removing the magazine.  The charging handle is pulled to the rear and the operator inspects the chamber to verify the gun is unloaded.  The operator presses forward on the retainer button at the rear of the receiver cover while simultaneously lifting up on the rear of the cover to remove it.  He then pushes spring assembly forward and lifts it from its raceway,  withdrawing it out of the bolt carrier and to the rear.  The operator must then pull the carrier assembly all the way to the rear, lift it and then pull it away.  He removes the bolt by pushing it to the rear of the bolt carrier; rotating the bolt so the camming lug clears the raceway on the underside of the bolt carrier and then pulls it forward and free.  When cleaning, the operator will pay special attention to the barrel, bolt face, and gas piston, then oil lightly and reassemble.

==Legal status in the USA==
Private ownership of fully-automatic AK-47 rifles is tightly regulated by the [[National Firearms Act]] of 1934.  The [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] ceased import of foreign manufactured fully-automatic firearms for civilian sales and possession effectively halting further importation of civilian accessible AK-47 rifles. In [[1986]], an amendment to the [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] stopped all future domestic manufacture of fully-automatic weapons for civilian use.  However, machine guns manufactured domestically prior to 1986 and imported prior to 1968 may be transferred between civilians in accordance with federal and state law.  Several Soviet and Chinese rifles made it into the U.S. during the mid-1960s when returning Vietnam Veterans brought them home after capture from enemy troops.  Many of these were properly registered during the 1968 NFA amnesty.  In addition, several states have laws on their books outlawing private possession of full-automatic firearms even with NFA approval.

Certain [[semi-automatic]] AK-47 models were banned by the now-expired [[Federal assault weapons ban]] of 1994&amp;ndash;2004. A semi-automatic rifle, similar externally to the AK-47 but operably identical to many hunting rifles, was used in a much publicized 1989 shooting in a [[Stockton, California]], schoolyard, and in the 1993 murders outside of the [[Langley, Virginia]], headquarters of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (see [[Mir Amir Kansi]]).  Another much-publicized use of the AK-47 in the United States happened when bank robbers exchanged fire with police after a botched robbery.  The [[North Hollywood shootout]] involved AK-47's that were illegal to possess.  Ignoring the law while committing numerous other felonies, both assailants were shot and died at the scene.  Citing these tragedies, gun control advocates lobbied for strict controls on military-style semi-automatic firearms even though most criminals do not buy their weapons legally.

==Cultural influence==
[[Image:Coat_of_arms_of_Mozambique.png|thumb|right|200px|Coat of arms of [[Mozambique]]]]

The AK-47 and its derivatives are favored by many non-[[Western world|West]]ern powers because of their ease of use, robustness, simplicity, and manufacturing cost effectiveness. Estimates for production range over 100 million units. During most of the [[Cold War]], the Soviet Union and China followed a military assistance program, supplying their arms and technical knowledge to numerous countries.  In addition, another policy saw the supply of weapons, free of charge, to pro-communist fighters such as the [[Sandinistas]] and [[Viet-Cong]].  This policy was mirrored in the West, with the United States providing arms to such groups as the Afghan [[Mujahideen]].

The broad proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just its numbers.  The AK-47 is included in the [[Mozambique]] flag and [[coat of arms]] (formerly also in [[Burkina Faso]] coat of arms) and the [[Hizballah]] flag. &quot;[[Kalash]]&quot;, a shortened form of &quot;[[Kalashnikov]]&quot;, is used as a name for boys in some African countries.  Moreover, moviemakers who arm cinema terrorists, gang members (e.g. films like ''[[Boyz N The Hood]]''), and &quot;bad guys&quot; in general with AK-47s add much to the weapon's cultural mystique.  Numerous computer and video games feature AK-47s. The weapon is used as a backdrop for reporters during Terrorism news stories.  Fiction writers are also quick to arm their characters with the weapon.

The sheer ubiquity of the AK-47, its iconography, the fact that it possesses easily the most distinguishable weapon outline, and its nefarious association with violent conflict will ensure a significant and conspicuous impact on society.

==Other versions==
The AK-47 and its descendants are or have been manufactured in the following countries: [[Egypt]], [[China]], [[North Korea]], [[East Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Yugoslavia]] (as the M70 and M80 series), [[Romania]], [[Hungary]] (as AMD-63 and AMD-65), [[Iraq]], and [[Bulgaria]]. Certainly more have been produced elsewhere, but the above list represents major producers. An updated AKM design is still produced in Russia.

The basic design of the AK-47 has been used as the basis for other successful rifle designs such as the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Rk 62|Valmet 62/76]], the [[Israel]]i [[Galil]], the [[India]]n [[INSAS]] and the Yugoslav [[Zastava (weapon)]] M76 and M77 and M77/82 (not to be confused with the [[Barrett]] [[M82 (rifle)|M82]]) rifles. Several [[bullpup]] designs have surfaced, although none have been produced in quantity.

==Quotes==
Yuri Orlov, the protagonist from the ''[[Lord of War]]'' film:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Of all the weapons in the vast Soviet arsenal, nothing was more profitable than Avtomat Kalashnikova model of 1947. More commonly known as the AK-47, or Kalashnikov. It's the world's most popular assault rifle. A weapon all fighters love. An elegantly simple 9-pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood. It doesn't break, jam, or overheat. It'll shoot whether it's covered in mud or filled with sand. It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do. The Soviets put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their flag. Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian people's greatest export. After that comes vodka, caviar, suicidal novelists. One thing is for sure, no one was lining up to buy their cars. [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/quotes]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ordell Robbie, the protagonist from the film ''[[Jackie Brown]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''There it is, the AK-47. When you absolutely, positively, have to kill every single motherfucker in the room; accept no substitute.'' [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119396/quotes]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Atanasoff-Berry Computer''' was the first electronic digital computer [http://www.cs.iastate.edu/jva/books/burks/overview.shtml] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC] and was a major step in the history of computing . It was built by [[John Vincent Atanasoff|Dr. John Vincent Atanasoff]] and [[Clifford E. Berry]] at [[Iowa State University]] during 1937-42. The Atanasoff-Berry Computer represented several innovations in computing, including a binary system of arithmetic, [[parallel processing]], [[DRAM|regenerative memory]], and a separation of memory and computing functions. It is sometimes referred to by its initials, ABC. John Vincent Atanasoff was awarded the [[National Medal of Technology]] by President [[George H. W. Bush]] in a Ceremony at the White House on November 13, 1990. 

[[Image:ABC.GIF|thumb|300px|]] The Atanasoff-Berry Computer, constructed in the basement of the Physics building at Iowa State University, took over two years to complete due to lack of funds. The prototype was first demonstrated in November of 1939. The computer weighed more than seven hundred pounds (320 kg). It contained approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) of wire, 280 dual-triode [[vacuum tube]]s, 31 [[thyratron]]s, and was about the size of a desk.

It was not a [[Turing complete]] computer, which distinguishes it from later, more general machines, such as the 1946 [[ENIAC]], 1949 [[EDVAC]], the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] designs, or [[Alan Turing]]'s post-War designs at [[National Physical Laboratory|NPL]] and elsewhere.  Nor did it implement the [[stored program architecture]] that made practical fully general-purpose, reprogrammable computers.  

The machine was, however, the first to implement three critical ideas that are still part of every modern computer: 
#Using [[binary_numeral_system|binary]] digits to represent all numbers and data
#Performing all calculations using [[electronics]] rather than wheels, ratchets, or mechanical switches
#Organizing a system in which [[computation]] and [[computer storage|memory]] are separated.

In addition, the computer pioneered the use of regenerative capacitor memory, as in the [[DRAM]] still widely used today.

The memory of the Atanasoff-Berry Computer was a pair of drums, each containing 1600 [[capacitor]]s that rotated on a common shaft once per second. The capacitors on each drum were organized into 32 &quot;bands&quot; of 50 (30 active bands and 2 spares in case a capacitor failed), giving the machine a speed of 30 additions/subtractions per second. Data was represented as 50-bit binary fixed point numbers. The electronics of the memory and arithmetic units could store and operate on 60 such numbers at a time (3000 bits). 

The [[alternating current|AC]] power line frequency of 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] was the primary clock rate for the lowest level operations.

The logic functions were fully electronic, implemented with vacuum tubes. The family of [[logic gates]] ranged from inverters to two and three input gates. The input and output levels and operating voltages were compatible between the different gates. Each gate consisted of one inverting vacuum tube amplifier, preceded by a resistor divider input network that defined the logical function. 

Although the Atanasoff-Berry Computer was an important step up from earlier computing machines, it was not a ''[[stored program]] computer''. An operator was needed to operate the control switches to set up its functions, much the way [[Booting|boot]] programs would be entered in later computers. Selection of the operation to be performed, reading, writing, converting to or from binary to decimal, or reducing a set of equations was made by front panel switches and in some cases jumpers.

There were two forms of input and output. Primary user input and output and an intermediate results output and input. The intermediate results storage allowed operation on problems too large to be handled entirely within the electronic memory. 

Intermediate results were written onto paper sheets by electrostatically modifying the resistance at 1500 locations to represent 30 of the 50 bit numbers. Each sheet could be written or read in one second. The reliability of the system was limited to about 1 error in 100,000 calculations by these units, primarily attributed to lack of control of the sheets' material characteristics. In retrospect a solution could have been to add a parity bit to each number as written. This problem was not solved by the time Atanasoff left the university for war-related work. 

Primary user input was via standard [[punched card]]s and output via a front panel display.

The ABC was designed for a fairly specific purpose, the solution of systems of simultaneous linear equations. It could handle systems with up to twenty-nine equations, which was large for the time. Problems of this scale were becoming common in physics, the department in which John Atanasoff worked.  Basically, it could be fed two linear equations with up to twenty-nine variables and a constant term and eliminate one of the variables.  This process would have to be repeated manually for each of the equations, which would result in a system of equations with one fewer variables.  Then the whole process would have to be repeated to eliminate another variable.

The initial funds to start development and demonstrate the circuits involved was from the [[Agronomy]] department which was also interested in such problems for economic and research analysis. Further funding to complete the machine came from [[Research Corporation]] of America, in [[New York]].

Presper Eckert and John Mauchly were the first to patent a digital computing device, their [[ENIAC]] computer. ABC had been examined by [[John Mauchly]] in June [[1941]], and is alleged to have influenced his later work on ENIAC, although Mauchly denied this. In [[1967]] [[Honeywell]] started a court case against Sperry Rand in an attempt to break their patent, based on the ABC being [[prior art]]. The court released its final judgement on October 19, 1973. In [http://www.cs.iastate.edu/jva/court-papers/ Sperry Rand Vs. Honeywell] the court voided the ENIAC patent as a derivative of John Atanasoff's invention. The decision was not appealed.

Atanasoff was quite generous in stating, &quot;there is enough credit for everyone in the invention and development of the electronic computer.&quot; Eckert and Mauchly received most of the credit for inventing the first electronic-digital computer. Historians now say that the Atanasoff-Berry computer was the first.

The original ABC was eventually dismantled, when the University converted the basement to classrooms, and all of its pieces except for one memory drum were discarded. In [[1997]], a team of researchers from [[Ames Laboratory]] (located on the Iowa State campus) finished building a working replica of the Atanasoff-Berry Computer for a cost of $350,000. This replica dispelled any doubt over whether or not the ABC actually could perform the tasks it was designed to do. The new ABC is now on permanent display in the first floor lobby of the Durham Center for Computation and Communication at Iowa State University.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Association of C and C++ Users''' ('''ACCU''') is a worldwide organisation of people interested in programming languages. Originally, the association was primarily for [[C programming language|C]] programmers (it was then called the CUG), but it has since added [[C++]], [[C Sharp programming language|C#]], [[Java programming language|Java]], [[Perl]], and [[Python programming language|Python]] programmers to its membership. The long form of the organisation's name is thus historical and seldom used, the name '''ACCU''' is preferred.

Members of ACCU include professional programmers and companies as well as amateur programmers. The association is operated by a volunteer [[committee]], which is responsible for the organisation of an ACCU [[conference]] each spring in or near Oxford, as well as the publication of a number of journals.

The association has two types of membership: Regular membership provides access to the conferences and the association's principal journal, ''C Vu'', which contains articles, letters, and book reviews by members; Advanced membership additionally provides a subscription to ''Overload'', which is designed for more advanced programmers. Full-time students qualify for membership [[discount]]s.

The '''Andes''' is a vast [[mountain range]] forming a continuous chain of highland along the western coast of [[South America]]. It is roughly [[1_E6_m|7,000 km]] (4,400&amp;nbsp;miles) long, [[1_E5_m|500 km]] (300&amp;nbsp;miles) wide in some parts (widest between 18Â° to 20Â°S latitude), and of an average height of about [[1_E3_m|4,000 m]] (13,000 feet). 

The Andean range is composed principally of two great chains separated by a deep intermediate [[depression (geology)|depression]], in which arise other chains of minor importance, the chief of which is [[Chile]]'s [[Cordillera de la Costa]].  Other small chains arise on the sides of the great chains. The ''Cordillera de la Costa'' starts from the southern extremity of the continent and runs in a northerly direction, parallel with the coast, being broken up at its beginning into a number of islands and afterwards forming the western boundary of the great central valley of Chile.  To the north this coastal chain continues in small ridges or isolated hills along the [[Pacific Ocean]] as far as [[Venezuela]], always leaving the same valley more or less visible to the west of the western great chain. The mountains extend over seven countries: [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]].

The Andes range is the highest mountain range outside Asia, with the highest peak, [[Aconcagua]], rising to 6,959 m (23,000 feet) [[above sea level]]. The summit of [[Mount Chimborazo]] in the Ecuadorean Andes is the point on the Earth's surface most distant from its center, because of the [[equatorial bulge]]. The Andes cannot match the [[Himalaya]] in height but do so in width and are more than twice as long.

==Physical features==
===Geology===
The formation of the Andes extends into the [[Paleozoic]] Era, when [[terrane]] accretion was the dominant process. It was during the [[Cretaceous]] Period that the Andes began to take their present form, by the uplifting, [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]] of [[sedimentary rocks|sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rocks]] of the ancient [[craton]]s to the east. Tectonic forces along the [[subduction zone]] along the entire west coast of South America where the [[Nazca Plate]] and a part of the [[Antarctic Plate]] are sliding beneath the [[South American Plate]] continue to produce an ongoing [[Orogeny|orogenic event]] resulting in minor to major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions to this day. In the extreme south a major [[transform fault]] separates [[Tierra del Fuego]] from the small [[Scotia Plate]]. Across the 1,000&amp;nbsp;km wide [[Drake Passage]] lie the mountains of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] south of the Scotia Plate which appear to be a continuation of the Andes chain. 

The Andes range has many active volcanoes, the most famous being [[Cotopaxi]], one of the highest active volcanos in the world.

The Andes can be divided into three sections: the Southern Andes in Argentina and Chile; the Central Andes, including the Chilean and Peruvian cordilleras; and the northern section in Venezuela, Colombia, and northern Ecuador consisting of two parallel ranges, the Cordillera Occidental and the Cordillera Oriental. The term ''cordillera'' comes from the Spanish word meaning 'rope'. The Andes range is approximately 200&amp;ndash;300&amp;nbsp;km wide throughout its length, except in the Bolivian flexure where it is 640&amp;nbsp;km wide [http://www.andes.org.uk/andes-information-files/famous-andes-peaks.htm] [http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/Cotopaxi.html].

===Climate===
The climate in the Andes varies greatly depending on location, altitude, proximity to the sea. The southern section is rainy and cool, the central Andes are dry. The northern Andes are typically rainy and warm, with an average temperature of 18&amp;nbsp;Â°C in Colombia. The climate is known to change drastically. [[Tropical rainforest]]s exist just miles away from the snow covered peak, Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The [[snow line]] depends on the location. It is at between 4,500&amp;ndash;4,800&amp;nbsp;m in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, rising to 4,800&amp;ndash;5,200&amp;nbsp;m in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30Â°S, then descending to 4,500&amp;nbsp;m on Aconcagua at 32Â°S, 2,000&amp;nbsp;m at 40Â°S, 500&amp;nbsp;m at 50Â°S, and only 300&amp;nbsp;m in [[Tierra del Fuego]] at 55Â°S; from 50Â°S, several of the larger glaciers descend to sea level ([[Google Earth]] images).
[[Image:andes - punta arenas.jpg|thumb|left|View of the mountains in the countryside just outside of [[Punta Arenas, Chile]].]]

===Plant and animal life===
[[Tropical rainforests]] encircle the northern Andes. The [[cinchona]], a source of [[quinine]] which is used to treat malaria, is found in the Bolivian Andes. The high-altitude ''[[Polylepis]]'' forests are present in the Andean areas of Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. The trees, QueÃ±ua, Yagual, Quinua and other names that local people use to call them, can be found at altitudes of 4,500&amp;nbsp;m above sea level. Once abundant, the forests began disappearing during the Incan period when much of it was used for building material and cooking fuel. The trees are now considered to be highly endangered with only 10 percent of the original forests remaining [http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/andes_climate_page.htm].

The [[llama]] can be found living at high altitudes, predominantly in the Peru and Bolivia. The alpaca, a type of llama, is raised for its wool. The nocturnal [[chinchilla]], an endangered member of the [[rodent]] order, inhabits the Andes' alpine regions. The South American [[condor]] is the largest bird of its kind in the Western hemisphere. Other animals include the [[guemul]], [[puma]], [[camelids]] and, for birds, the [[partridge]], [[parina]], [[huallata]], and [[coot]]. Llamas and pumas play important roles in many Andean cultures.

==The people==
{{sect-stub}}

===Transportation===
The people of the Andes are not well connected with the city.  Due to the arduous terrain, vehicles are discouraged.  People generally walk to their destinations, using the llama as their primary pack animal.

===Agriculture===
The ancient peoples of the Andes such as the Incas have practiced irrigation techniques for over 6,000 years.  Because of the mountain slopes, terracing has been a common practice.  Maize and barley were important crops for these people.  Currently, tobacco, cotton and coffee are the main export crops.  The potato holds a very important role as an internally consumed crop.

By far the most important plant in terms of history and culture is coca, the leaves of which have been central to the Andean people for centuries. Coca has been a staple dietary supplement and cornerstone to Andean culture throughout much of its history.

===Mining===
Mining is quite prosperous in the Andes, with iron, gold, silver and copper being the main production minerals.  The Andes are reputed to be one of the most important sources of these minerals in the world.

This is a partial listing of the major peaks in the Andes mountain range&amp;mdash;typically 5 km or more in height.

The '''European anchovy''' (''Engraulis encrasicholus'') is a [[fish]] somewhat related to the [[herring]].  Anchovies are placed in the family [[Engraulidae]].

It is easily distinguished by its deeply-cleft mouth, the angle of the gape being behind the eyes.  The pointed snout extends beyond the lower jaw.  The fish resembles a sprat in having a forked tail and a single dorsal fin, but 
the body is round and slender.  The maximum length is 8 1/8 in.  

Anchovies are abundant in the [[Mediterranean]], and are 
regularly caught on the coasts of [[Sicily]], [[Turkey]], [[Italy]], [[France]] and 
Spain.  The range of the species also extends along the 
Atlantic coast of Europe to the south of [[Norway]].  In winter 
it is common off Devon and Cornwall ([[Great Britain]]), but has not hitherto been caught in such numbers as to be of commercial importance. 

Formerly they were caught in large numbers off the coast of the [[Netherlands]] in summer when they entered the [[Wadden Sea]] and [[Zuider Zee]].  After the closing of the [[Zuider Zee]] they were still found in the Wadden Sea until the [[1960s]]. They were also caught in the estuary of the [[Scheldt]].  

There is reason to believe that the anchovies found at the western end of the English Channel in November and December are those which annually migrated from the [[Zuider Zee]] and Scheldt in autumn, returning thither in the following 
spring; they were assumed to form an isolated stock, for none come up from the south in summer to occupy the [[English Channel]], though the species is resident on the coast of [[Portugal]].  

The explanation appears to be that the shallow and landlocked waters of the Zuider Zee, as well as the sea on the Dutch coast, become raised to a higher temperature in summer than any part of the sea about the British coasts, and that therefore anchovies were able to spawn and maintain their numbers in these waters.  

Their reproduction and development were first described by a Dutch naturalist from observations made on the shores of the Zuider Zee. Spawning takes place in June and July, and the eggs, like those of the majority of marine fishes, are buoyant and transparent, but they are peculiar in having an elongated, sausage-like shape, instead of being globular.  They resemble those of the sprat and [[pilchard]] in having a segmented yolk and there is no oil globule.

The larva hatch two or three days after the fertilization of the egg, and are minute and transparent.  In August young specimens 1&amp;frac12; to 3&amp;frac12; in. in length have been taken in the Zuider Zee, and these must derived from the spawning of the previous summer.

There is no evidence to decide the question whether all the young anchovies as well as the adults leave the Zuider Zee in autumn, but, considering the winter temperature there, it is probable that they do.  The eggs have also been obtained from the Bay of Naples, and near Marseilles, also off the coast 
of Holland, and once at least off the coast of Lancashire.  

The occurrence of anchovies in the English Channel has been carefully studied at the laboratory of the Marine Biological Association at Plymouth. They were most abundant in 1889 and 1890.  In the former year considerable numbers were taken off Dover in drift nets of small mesh used for the capture of sprats.  In the following December large numbers were taken together with sprats at Torquay.  In November 1890 a thousand of the fish were obtained in two days from the pilchard boats fishing near Plymouth; these were caught near the Eddystone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For alternate meanings see [[anchor (disambiguation)]]''

A ship's or boat's '''anchor''' is used to attach the vessel to the bottom at a specific point. There are two primary classes of anchorsâtemporary and permanent. A permanent anchor is often called a ''[[mooring]]'', and is rarely moved; it's quite possible the vessel cannot hoist it aboard but must hire a service to move or maintain it. A temporary anchor is usually carried by the vessel, and hoisted aboard whenever the vessel is under way.

An anchor works by resisting the movement force of the vessel which is attached to it. There are two primary ways to do this - via sheer mass, and by &quot;hooking&quot; into the [[seabed]]. It may seem logical to think wind and currents are the largest forces an anchor must overcome, but actually the vertical movement of [[Ocean surface wave|waves]] develop the largest loads, and modern anchors are designed to use a combination of technique and shape to resist all these forces.

[[Image:Anchor1.png|right|frame|A stocked ship's anchor.&lt;small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a. Shank&lt;br /&gt;b. Crown&lt;br /&gt;c. Arm&lt;br /&gt;d. Fluke&lt;br /&gt;e. Point&lt;br /&gt;f. &amp; g. Eye and Ring&lt;br /&gt;h. Stock&lt;br /&gt;i. Fisherman's bend&lt;/small&gt;]]
The kind of anchor you probably envision is a temporary anchor, the kind which might be carried aboard a [[ship]] or a [[boat]]. A modern temporary anchor usually consists of a central bar called the ''shank'', and an armature with some form of flat surface (''fluke'' or ''palm'') to grip the bottom and a point to assist penetration of the bottom; the position at which the armature is attached to the shank is called the ''crown'', and the shank is usually fitted with a ring or shackle to attach it to the [[cable]]. There are many variations and additions to these basic elementsâfor example, the whole class of anchors which include a ''stock'' such as the [[anchor#Fisherman|fisherman]] and [[anchor#Fluke|fluke]] anchors.

A permanent anchor, on the other hand, may come in a wide range of types and has no standard form. A slab of rock with an iron ''staple'' in it to attach a chain to serves very well, as does a Chevy long-block motor. Modern moorings may be anchored by sand screws which look and act very much like over-sized screws drilled into the seabed, or by barbed metal beams pounded in (or even driven in with explosives) like pilings, or a variety of other non-mass means of getting a grip on the bottom. One method of building a mooring is to use three or more temporary anchors laid out with short lengths of chain attached to a swivel, so no matter which direction the vessel moves one or more anchors will be aligned to resist the force.

An interesting element of anchor jargon is the term ''under weigh'', which describes the anchor when it is hanging on the rope, not on the bottom; this is linked to the term ''to weigh anchor'', meaning to lift the anchor from the sea bed, allowing the ship or boat to move. Usually an anchor is described as ''under weigh'' when it has been broken out of the bottom and is being hauled up to the boat because all the weight of the anchor and rode (a term for the chain linking the anchor and the ship) are lifted, and when lifted from the water it becomes ''stowed''. Although the terms may be linked, ''under weigh'' should not be confused with ''under way'', which describes a vessel which is moving through the water,


== Development ==

The earliest anchors were probably rocks and many rock anchors have been found dating from at least the [[Bronze Age]]. Many modern moorings still rely on a large rock as the primary element of their design. It simply works. However, using pure mass to resist the forces of a storm only works well as a permanent mooring; trying to move a large enough rock to another bay is nearly impossible.

A simple anchor using a pair of wood arms under a rock mass is a primitive anchor which is still in use today. The wood arms are pointed to penetrate the bottom, and the mass will overcome normal movement forces. Together they comprise what may have been the first successful attempts to hook into the seabed and use the strength there to prevent a vessel from moving. Almost all future anchor developments combine these two elementsâa penetrating point and a reasonable mass.

In the western world the vast majority of anchors worked on the concept of the grappling hookâmultiple points on arms such that at least one will be aimed toward the bottom. Suddenly the concept of the stock, a bar placed perpendicular to the hooking arm at the other end of the shank which would roll the anchor over so the point would penetrate the bottom, was developed and within a single century became the standard anchor type.

In the East, however, another model of anchor had been known for some time which also used a stock, but with the stock located at the crown along with the arm. This successful model is still built today in virtually unchanged form. It also informed such modern designs as the [[US Navy]]'s stockless Mark IV and the [[anchor#Fluke|fluke-style anchor]].

== Designs of temporary anchors  ==

The range of designs is wide, but there are actually trends in designs for modern anchors which allow them to be classed as ''hook, plow'', and ''fluke'' types, depending on the method by which they set.

* ''Hook'' designs use a relatively small fluke surface on a heavy, narrow arm to penetrate deeply into problematic bottoms such as rocky, heavy kelp or eel grass, coral, or hard sand. Two of the more common versions of this design are the [[anchor#Fisherman|fisherman]] and the [[anchor#Grapnel|grapnel]].

* ''Plow'' designs are reminiscent of the antique farm plow, and are designed to bury themselves the bottom as force is applied to them, and are considered good in most bottom conditions from soft mud to rock. ''North sea'' designs are actually a variation of a plow in how they work; they bury into the bottom using their shape.

* ''Fluke'' designs use large fluke surfaces to develop very large resistance to loads once they dig into the seabed. Although they have less ability to penetrate and are designed to reset rather than turn, their light weight makes them very popular.

In the past 20 years or so, many new anchor designs have appeared. Driven by the popularity of private pleasure boats, these anchors are usually designed for small to medium sized vessels, and are usually not appropriate for large ships. See [[anchor#Modern_designs|modern designs]].

=== Fisherman ===
[[Image:fisherman2-sm.jpg|thumb|left|A fisherman style anchor suspended against the bows]]
A traditional design, the fisherman, also known as a ''kedge'', is familiar to people who've never used an anchor. The design is a non-burying type, with one arm penetrating the seabed and the other standing proud. The anchor is popular as the ultimate storm anchor, and has a good reputation for use in rock, hard bottoms, and kelp or eel grass covered bottoms. The three piece versions can be stowed quite compactly, and most versions include a folding stock so the anchor may be stowed flat on deck.
[[Image:Walraversijde28.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Medieval kedge with double stock; ca. 1465]]
The primary weakness of the design is its ability to foul the cable over changing tides. Once fouled the anchor is likely to drag. In comparison tests the fisherman design developed much less resistance than other anchors of similar weight. It is difficult to bring aboard without scarring the topsides, and does not stow in a hawse pipe or over an anchor roller.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;

=== Fluke ===

[[Image:Fluke anchor.gif|thumb|A fluke-style anchor]]

The most common commercial brand is the Danforth, which is sometimes used as a generic name for the class. The fluke style uses a stock at the crown to which two large flat surfaces are attached. The stock is hinged so the flukes can orient toward the bottom (and on some designs may be adjusted for an optimal angle depending on the bottom type.) The design is a burying variety, and once well set can develop an amazing amount resistance. Its light weight and compact flat design make it easy to retrieve and relatively easy to store; some anchor rollers and hawse pipes can accommodate a fluke-style anchor. A few high-performance designs are available, such as the Fortress, which are lighter in weight for a given area and in tests have shown better than average results.

The fluke anchor has difficulty penetrating kelp and weed-covered bottoms, as well as rocky and particularly hard sand or clay bottoms. If there is much current or the vessel is moving while dropping the anchor it may &quot;kite&quot; or &quot;skate&quot; over the bottom due to the large fluke area acting as a sail or wing. Once set, the anchor tends to break out and reset when the direction of force changes dramatically, such as with the changing tide, and on some occasions it might not reset but instead drag.

=== Grapnel ===
[[Image:Grapnel-sm.jpg|thumb|A grapnel-style anchor]]
A traditional design, the grapnel style is simple to design and build. It has a benefit in that no matter how it reaches the bottom one or more tines will be aimed to set. The design is a non-burying variety, with one or more tines digging in and the remainder above the seabed. In coral it is often able to set quickly by hooking into the structure, but may be more difficult to retrieve. A grapnel is often quite light, and may have additional uses as a tool to recover gear lost overboard; its weight also makes it relatively easy to bring aboard.

Grapnels rarely have enough fluke area to develop much hold in sand, clay, or mud. It is not unknown for the anchor to foul on its own rode, or to foul the tines with refuse from the bottom, preventing it from digging in. It is quite possible for this anchor to find such a good hook that, without a trip line, it is impossible to retrieve. The shape is generally not very compact, and is difficult to stow, although there are a few collapsing designs available.

=== North sea ===
[[Image:Anchor_Bruce.jpg|thumb|Small-boat version of the popular Bruce]]
Designed originally for anchoring floating oil derricks in the [[North Sea]], this versatile design has become a popular option for smaller boaters as well. The burying design acts similarly to a large scoop, and is known for the speed with which it digs in. Although not an articulated design, it has the reputation of not breaking out with tide or wind changes, instead slowly turning in the bottom to align with the force. Some versions of the design, such as the Bruce, are reputed to be easy to retrieve once broken out of the bottom, and some anchor rollers can accommodate their shank.

North sea designs may have difficulty penetrating weedy bottoms, rock, and coral. They can be particularly difficult to break out.  Although they can be got aboard without scarring the topsides, they take up an inordinate amount of locker space. They cannot be used with hawse pipes.

[[Image:Anchor_CQR.jpg|thumb|A CQR anchor]]
=== Plow ===
Several companies produce a plow-style design, and they are particularly popular with cruising sailors. Plows are generally good in all bottoms, but not exceptional in any. The CQR design has a hinged shank, allowing the anchor to turn with direction changes rather than breaking out, and also arranged to force the point of the plow into the bottom if the anchor lands on its side. Another commercial design, the Delta uses an unhinged shank and a plow with specific angles to develop very similar performance. Both can be stored in some anchor roller designs

The plow is heavier than the average for the amount of resistance developed, and may take slightly longer pull to set thoroughly. It cannot be stored in a hawse pipe.


=== Modern designs ===
[[Image:Anchor_Rocna.jpg|thumb|The New Zealand designed Rocna is an example of modern anchor design]]
In recent years there has been something of a spurt in anchor design. Primarily designed to set very quickly, then generate superior holding power, these anchors (mostly proprietary inventions still under patent) are finding homes with users of small to medium sized vessels.
* The German designed ''BÃ¼gel'' has a sharp tip for penetrating weed, and features a roll-bar which orients the anchor to the correct attitude on the seabed
* The ''Bulwagga'' is a unique design featuring three flukes instead of the regular two. It has performed well in tests by independent sources such as American boating magazine ''Practical Sailor''. [http://www.noteco.com/bulwagga/ Manufacturer's website]
* The ''Spade'' is a French design particularly popular with sailors. Although relatively expensive, it performs well, and features a demountable shank and optional aluminium construction, which means a lighter and more easily stowable anchor
* The New Zealand designed ''Rocna'' is a new anchor gaining popularity amongst cruisers. It too features a sharp toe for penetrating weed and grass, and has a particularly large fluke area. Its roll-bar is similar to that of the BÃ¼gel, and means the correct setting attitude is achieved without the need for extra weight to be inserted into the tip (an inefficiency common in other anchor types).

== Designs of permanent anchors  ==

These are used where the vessel is permanently sited, for example in the case of [[lightvessel]]s or channel marker [[buoy]]s.  The anchor needs to hold the vessel in all weathers, including the most severe [[storm]], but only occasionally, or never, needs to be lifted, only for example if the vessel is to be towed into port for maintenance. An alternative to using an anchor under these circumstances may be to use a pile driven into the seabed.

=== Mushroom ===

The mushroom anchor is suitable where the seabed is composed of silt or fine sand.  It was invented by [[Robert Stevenson]], for use by an 82 ton converted fishing boat, ''Pharos'', which was used as a [[lightvessel]] between [[1807]] and [[1810]] near to [[Bell Rock]] whilst the [[lighthouse]] was being constructed. It was equipped with a 1.5 ton example.

It is shaped like an inverted mushroom, the head becoming buried in the silt.  A counterweight is often provided at the other end of the shank to lay it down before it becomes buried. 

A mushroom anchor will normally sink in the silt to the point where it has displaced its own weight in bottom material. These anchors are only suitable for a silt or mud bottom, since they rely upon suction and cohesion of the bottom material, which rocky or coarse sand bottoms lack. The holding power of this anchor is at best about twice its weight unless it becomes buried, when it can be as much as ten times its weight[http://www.inamarmarine.com/pdf/Moorings.pdf]. They are available in sizes from about 10 lb up to several tons.

=== Deadweight ===

This is an anchor which relies solely on being a heavy weight.  It is usually just a large block of concrete or stone at the end of the chain.  Its holding power is equal to its weight underwater (i.e. taking its buoyancy into account) regardless of the type of seabed, although suction can increase this if it becomes buried.  Consequently deadweight anchors are used where mushroom anchors are unsuitable, for example in rock, gravel or coarse sand. An advantage of a deadweight anchor over a mushroom is that if it does become dragged, then it continues to provide its original holding force.  The disadvantage of using deadweight anchors in conditions where a mushroom anchor could be used is that it needs to be around ten times the weight of the equivalent mushroom anchor..

== Anchoring techniques ==
[[Image:AS_HMAS Canberra_1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Naval anchor incorporated into [[HMAS Canberra (1927)]] memorial, [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]]]

Heaving an anchor over the side is not good enough. There are several elements to anchor gear to be considered, and there are techniques to ensure a good ''set''. This article can discuss some of this information, but it is by no means a treatise for safe anchoring.

=== Anchoring gear ===

The elements of anchoring gear include the anchor, the cable (also called a ''rode''), the method of attaching the two together, the method of attaching the cable to the ship, charts, and a method of learning the depth of the water.

Charts are vital to good anchoring. Knowing the location of potential dangers, as well as being useful in estimating the effects of weather and tide in the anchorage, is essential in choosing a good place to drop the hook. One can get by without referring to charts, but they are an important tool and a part of good anchoring gear, and a skilled mariner would not choose to anchor without them.

The depth of water is necessary for determining ''scope'', which is the ratio of length of cable to the depth measured from the highest point (usually the anchor roller or bow chock) to the seabed. For example, if the water is 25ft (8m) deep, and the anchor roller is 3ft (1m) above the water, the scope is the ratio between the amount of cable let out and 28ft (9m). For this reason it is important to have a reliable and accurate method of measuring the depth of water. 

A cable or rode is the rope, chain, or combination thereof used to connect the anchor to the vessel. Neither rope nor chain is fundamentally superior as a cable or there would not be continued argument over the issue; each has its strengths and its weaknesses and it is not the purpose of this article to address these.

=== Anchoring ===

The four primary questions to be considered before actually anchoring:
:# Is the anchorage protected?
:# Is the seabed good holding ground?
:# What is the depth, tidal range, and the current tide state?
:# Is there enough room?

==== Is the anchorage protected? ====

A good anchorage offers protection from the current weather conditions, and will also offer protection from the expected weather. You should also consider if the anchorage will be suitable for other purposes, for example can you get safely to shore in your dinghy if that is one of your goals. And keep in mind comfort; a rolly harbor is no fun.

==== Is the seabed good holding ground? ====

You should have charts to indicate the kind of bottom, as well as a tool such as a [[sounding lead]] to collect a sample from the bottom. Generally speaking, most anchors will hold well in sandy mud, mud and clay, or firm sand. Loose sand and soft mud are not desirable bottoms, and especially soft mud which should be avoided if at all possible. Rock, coral, and shale prevent anchors from digging in, although some anchors are designed to hook into such a bottom. Grassy bottoms may be good holding, but only if the anchor can penetrate the bottom.

==== What is the depth, tidal range, and the current tide state? ====

If your anchorage is affected by [[tide]], you need to know the tide range and the times of high and low water. You need enough depth for your vessel throughout the range it might swing, at low tide, not just where you drop the anchor. This is also important when determining [[scope]], which should be figured for high tide and not the current tide state.

==== Is there enough room? ====

If your anchorage is affected by tide, you should keep in mind that the swing range will be larger at low tide than at high tide. However, no matter where you anchor you need to consider what the larges possible swing range will be, and what obstacles and hazards might be within that range. Keep in mind that other vessels in the anchorage may have a swing range which can overlap yours. Boats on permanent moorings, or shorter scope, may not swing as far as you expect them to, or may swing either more rapidly or more slowly than your vessel (all-chain cables tend to swing more slowly than all-rope or chain-and-rope cables.)

There are techniques of anchoring to limit the swing of a vessel if the anchorage has limited room.

=== Methods ===

The basic anchoring consists of determining the location, dropping the anchor, laying out the scope, setting the hook, and assessing where the vessel ends up. After figuring out on the chart where a desirable location would be, the vessel need to actually see what the situation is like; there may be other boats who thought that would be a good spot, or weather conditions are different than expected, or even additional hazards not noted on the chart which make a planned location undesirable.

If the location is good, the location to drop the anchor should be approached from down wind or down current, whichever is stronger. As the chosen spot is approached, the vessel should be stopped or even beginning to drift back. The anchor should be lowered quickly but under control until it is on the bottom. The vessel should continue to drift back, and the cable should be veered out under control so it will be relatively straight.

Once the desired scope is laid out (a minimum of 8:1 for setting the anchor, and 5:1 for holding, though the preferred ratio is 10:1 for both setting, and holding power), the vessel should be gently forced astern, usually using the auxiliary motor but possibly by backing a sail. A hand on the anchor line may telegraph a series of jerks and jolts, indicating the anchor is dragging, or a smooth tension indicative of digging in. As the anchor begins to dig in and resist backward force, the engine may be throttled up to get a thorough set. If the anchor continues to drag, or sets after having dragged to far, it should be retrieved and moved back to the desired position (or another location chosen.)

With the anchor set in the correct location, everything should be reconsidered. Is the location protected, now and for the forecast weather? Is the bottom a suitable holding ground, and is the anchor the right one for this type of bottom? Is there enough depth, both now and at low tide? Especially at low tide but also at all tide states, is there enough room for the boat to swing? Will another vessel swing into us, or will we swing into another vessel, when the tide or wind changes?

Some other techniques have been developed to reduce swing, or to deal with heavy weather.
:* [[Anchor#Forked moor|Forked moor]]
:* [[Anchor#Bow and Stern|Bow and Stern]]
:* [[Anchor#Bahamian moor|Bahamian moor]]
:* [[Anchor#Backing an anchor|Backing an anchor]]

==== Forked moor ====

Using two anchors set approximately 45Â° apart, or wider angles up to 90Â°, from the bow is a strong mooring for facing into strong winds. To set anchors in this way, first one anchor is set in the normal fashion. Then, taking in on the first cable as the boat is motored into the wind and letting slack while drifting back, a second anchor is set approximately a half-scope away from the first on a line perpendicular to the wind. After this second anchor is set, the scope on the first is taken up until the vessel is lying between the two anchors and the load is taken equally on each cable.

This moor also to some degree limits the range of a vessel's swing to a narrower oval. Care should be taken that other vessels will not swing down on the boat due to the limited swing range.

==== Bow and stern ====

Not to be mistaken with the '''[[Anchor#Bahamian moor|Bahamian moor]]''', below.

In the ''Bow and Stern'' technique, an anchor is set off each the bow and the stern, which can severely limit a vessel's swing range and also align it to steady wind, current or wave conditions. One method of accomplishing this moor is to set a bow anchor normally, then drop back to the limit of the bow cable (or to double the desired scope, e.g. 8:1 if the eventual scope should be 4:1, 10:1 if the eventual scope should be 5:1, etc.) to lower a stern anchor. By taking up on the bow cable the stern anchor can be set. After both anchors are set, tension is taken up on both cables to limit the swing or to align the vessel.

==== Bahamian moor ====

Similar to the above, a ''Bahamian moor'' is used to sharply limit the swing range of a vessel, but allows it to swing to a current. One of the primary characteristics of this technique is the use of a swivel as follows: the first anchor is set normally, and the vessel drops back to the limit of anchor cable. A second anchor is attached to the end of the anchor cable, and is dropped and set. A swivel is attached to the middle of the anchor cable, and the vessel connected to that. 

The vessel will now swing in the middle of two anchors, which is acceptable in strong reversing currents but a wind perpendicular to the current may break out the anchors as they are not aligned for this load.

==== Backing an anchor ====

Also known as ''Tandem anchors'', in this technique two anchors are shackled to a single cable running crown-to-shank. With the leading anchor holding the cable down and the tension between the anchors taking load off, this technique can develop great holding power and has been used in &quot;ultimate storm&quot; circumstances. It does not limit swinging range, and might not be appropriate for crowded anchorages.

=== Kedging ===

''Kedging'' is a technique for moving or turning a ship by using a relatively light anchor known as a ''kedge''. It was of particular relevance to sailing warships which used them to out-manoeuvre opponents when the wind had dropped but might be used by any vessel in confined, shoal water to place it in a more desirable position, provided she had enough manpower.

'''Anbar''', originally called '''Firuz Shapur''', or '''Perisapora''', a town founded about AD [[350]] by [[Shapur II of Persia|Shapur (Sapor) II]], [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] king of [[Persia]], on the east bank of the [[Euphrates]], just south of the Nahr Isa, or Sakhlawieh [[canal]], the northernmost of the canals connecting that river with the [[Tigris]], in lat. 33 deg.  22' N., long. 43 deg.  49' E. 

It was captured and destroyed by the emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] in A.D. [[363]], but speedily rebuilt.
It became a refuge for the [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Jew]]ish colonies of that region, and there are said to have been 90,000 Jews in the place at the time of its capture by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] in [[657]].
The Arabs changed the name of the town to Anbar (&quot;[[granaries]]&quot;).

Abu al-Abbas as-Saffah, the founder of the [[Abbasid]] caliphate, made it his capital, and such it remained until the founding of [[Baghdad]] in [[762]]. It continued to be a place of much importance throughout the Abbasid period, but now it is now entirely deserted, occupied only by ruin mounds. Their great extent indicates the former importance of the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anazarbus''' (med. '''Ain Zarba'''; mod. [[Anavarza]]) was an ancient [[Cilicia]]n city, situated in [[Anatolia]] in modern [[Turkey]], in the [[Aleian plain]] about 10 miles west of the main stream of the [[Pyramus river]] (Jihun) and near its tributary the [[Sempas Su]].

A lofty isolated ridge formed its [[acropolis]]. Though some of the masonry in the ruins is certainly pre-Roman, the [[Suda]]'s identification of it with [[Cyinda]], famous as a treasure city in the wars of [[Eumenes of Cardia]], cannot be accepted in the face of [[Strabo]]'s express location of Cyinda in western Cilicia.  

Under the early [[Roman empire]] the place was known as '''Caesarea''', and was the metropolis of [[Cilicia Secunda]]. Rebuilt by the emperor [[Justin I]] after an [[earthquake]], it became '''Justinopolis''' ([[525]]); but the old native name persisted, and when [[Thoros I of Armenia|Thoros I]], king of [[Lesser Armenia]], made it his capital early in the [[12th century]], it was known as '''Anazarva'''.  

Its great natural strength and situation, not far from the mouth of the [[Sis pass]], and near the great road which debouched from the [[Cilician Gates]], made Anazarbus play a considerable part in the struggles between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the early [[Muslim]] invaders. It had been rebuilt by [[Harun al-Rashid]] in [[796]], refortified at great expense by [[Saif ad-Daula]], the [[Hamdanid]] (10th century) and sacked, and ruined by the crusaders. 

The present wall of the lower city is of late construction, probably Armenian.  It encloses a mass of ruins conspicuous in which are a fine [[triumphal arch]], the colonnades of two streets, a [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], etc. A stadium and a theatre lie outside on the south.  The remains of the acropolis fortifications are very interesting, including roads and ditches hewn in the rock; but beyond ruins of two churches and a fine tower built by Thoros I. There are no notable structures in the upper town.  For picturesqueness the site is not equalled in Cilicia, and it is worthwhile to trace the three fine [[aqueduct]]s to their sources.

A visit in December, 2002 showed that the three aqueducts mentioned above have been nearly completely destroyed. Only small, isolated sections are left standing with the largest portion lying in a pile of rubble that stretches the length of where the aqueducts once stood. A powerful earthquake that struck the area in 1945 is thought to be responsible for the destruction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''anagram''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''ana-'' = &quot;back&quot; or &quot;again&quot;, and ''graphein'' = &quot;to write&quot;) is a type of [[word play]], the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce other words, using all the original letters exactly once.  Anagrams are often expressed in the form of an equation, with the equals symbol (=) separating the original subject and the resulting anagram. âEarth = heartâ is an example of a simple anagram expressed so.  In a more advanced, sophisticated form of anagramming, the aim is to âdiscoverâ a result that has a linguistic meaning that defines or comments on the original subject in a humorous or ironic way; e.g., '''''Roll in the hay = Thrill a honey''''' (discovered by Tony Crafter).  When the subject and the resulting anagram form a complete sentence, a tilde (~) is used instead of an equal sign; e.g., '''''[[Semolina]] ~ is no meal.'''''

==History==
The construction of anagrams is an [[amusement]] of great [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. [[Jew]]s are often credited with the invention of anagrams, probably because later Hebrew writers, particularly [[Kabbalist]]s, were fond of it, asserting that &quot;secret mysteries are woven in the numbers of letters&quot;. Anagrams were known to the [[ancient Greece|Greek]]s and also to the [[ancient Rome|Roman]]s, although the known [[Latin]] examples of words of more than one syllable are nearly all imperfect. The Romans called the art of finding anagrams the &quot;ars magna&quot; (great art). Interestingly, &quot;ars magna&quot; is a perfect anagram of the word &quot;anagrams&quot;. 

They were popular throughout [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

Indeed, the right to lampoon royalty and politicians via anagram was enshrined in English law in 1215, when King John, albeit under duress, signed the [[Magna Carta]] ''(Magna Carta  = Anagram Act)'' at Runnymede, in Surrey, and later, particularly in [[France]], where an &quot;Anagrammatist to the King&quot; was appointed by [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]].   W. Camden (''Remains,'' 7th ed., 1674) defines &quot;Anagrammatisme&quot; as &quot;a dissolution of a name truly written into his letters, as his elements, and a new connection of it by artificial transposition, without addition, subtraction or change of any letter, into different words, making some perfect sense applyable (i.e., ''applicable'') to the person named.&quot; [[John Dryden|Dryden]] disdainfully called the pastime the &quot;torturing of one poor word ten thousand ways&quot; but many men and women of note have found amusement in it. 

A well-known anagram is the change of &quot;Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum&quot; (''Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord [is] with you'') into &quot;Virgo serena, pia, munda et immaculata&quot; (''Bright virgin, pious, clean and spotless''). Among others are the anagrammatic answer to [[Pilate]]'s question, &quot;Quid est veritas?&quot; (''What is truth?''), namely, &quot;Est vir qui adest&quot; (''It is the man who is here''); and the transposition of &quot;[[Horatio Nelson]]&quot; into &quot;Honor est a Nilo&quot; (Latin = ''Honor is from the [[Nile]]''); and of &quot;[[Florence Nightingale]]&quot; into &quot;Flit on, cheering angel&quot;. [[James I of England|James I]]'s courtiers discovered in &quot;James Stuart&quot; &quot;a just master&quot;, and converted &quot;Charles James Stuart&quot; into &quot;Claimes Arthur's seat&quot;. &quot;Eleanor Audeley&quot;, wife of [[Sir John Davies]], is said to have been brought before the High Commission in 1634 for extravagances, stimulated by the discovery that her name could be transposed to &quot;Reveale, O Daniel&quot;, and to have been laughed out of court by another anagram submitted by the [[Dean of Arches|dean of the Arches]], &quot;Dame Eleanor Davies&quot;, &quot;Never soe mad a ladie&quot;.

==Numerical anagrams==
Numerical anagrams use [[Roman numeral]]s within words. These numeral letters, taken together according to their numerical values, express some epoch, such as the year of an event.{{ref label|1728|1|^}}

An example of this kind is a [[distich]] of [[Godart]] on the birth of the [[List of French monarchs|French king]] [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], which occurred in the year 1638, on a day wherein there was an [[astrology|astrological]] [[conjunction]] of the [[Aquila (constellation)|Eagle]] with the [[Regulus|Lion's Heart]]:

:&quot;e'''X'''or'''I'''ens '''D'''e'''L'''ph'''I'''n aq'''VIL'''Ã¦ '''C'''or'''DI'''sq'''V'''e '''L'''eon'''I'''s
:'''C'''ongress'''V''' ga'''LL'''os spe '''L'''Ã¦t'''I'''t'''I'''aq'''V'''e refe'''CI'''t.&quot;

This roughly translates to, &quot;On the conjunction of the eagle and the heart of the lion, the new [[Dauphin]] brings hope and happiness to the French.&quot; The highlighted Roman numerals sum to 1638.{{ref label|1728|1|^}}

==Pseudonyms==
The [[pseudonym]]s adopted by [[author]]s are often transposed forms, more or less exact, of their names; thus &quot;Calvinus&quot; becomes &quot;Alcuinus&quot; ([[V]] = [[U]]); &quot;[[Francois Rabelais]]&quot; = &quot;Alcofribas Nasier&quot;; &quot;[[Arrigo Boito]]&quot; = &quot;Tobia Gorrio&quot;; &quot;[[Edward Gorey]]&quot; = &quot;Ogdred Weary&quot;; &quot;[[Vladimir Nabokov]]&quot; = &quot;Vivian Darkbloom&quot;, = &quot;Vivian Bloodmark&quot; or = &quot;Dorian Vivalcomb&quot;; &quot;[[Bryan Waller Proctor]]&quot; = &quot;Barry Cornwall, poet&quot;; &quot;Henry Rogers&quot; = &quot;R. E. H. Greyson&quot;; &quot;(Sanche) de Gramont&quot; = &quot;[[Ted Morgan]]&quot;, and so on. It is to be noted that several of these are &quot;imperfect anagrams&quot;, letters having been left out in some cases for the sake of easy pronunciation.

&quot;Telliamed&quot;, a simple reversal, is the title of a well known work by &quot;De Maillet&quot;. One of the most remarkable pseudonyms of this class is the name &quot;[[Voltaire]]&quot;, which the celebrated [[philosopher]] assumed instead of his family name, FranÃ§ois Marie Arouet, and which is now generally allowed to be an anagram of &quot;Arouet, l[e] j[eune]&quot;, that is, &quot;Arouet the younger&quot;.  Anagramming may also be used to good effect in [[farce]] or [[parody]]. A writer might take an unpleasant person he knows, base a character in a book on him, and then transpose the letters in the source's name. For example, controversial Israeli Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] might be satirized as, say, local greengrocer &quot;Leon A. Shirra&quot;&amp;mdash;a rather inventive way to avoid a [[libel]] lawsuit.

Anagrams have also shown up in [[rock music]]. [[The Doors]]' lead singer [[Jim Morrison]] invoked his name as &quot;Mr. Mojo Risin'&quot; on the song &quot;[[L.A. Woman]]&quot;, the band Sad CafÃ© released an album called ''Facades'', [[Blur]] singer [[Damon Albarn]] uses the name Dan Abnormal for the title of a song on [[The Great Escape]] and all of the band adopt anagramed pseudonyms for the [[music video]] of [[M.O.R.]], the [[New Wave music|new wave]] band [[Missing Persons]] recorded an album called ''Spring Session M'', and Guns N' Roses lead singer [[Axl Rose]]'s stage name is an anagram of &quot;[[oral sex]]&quot;.

==Astronomy==
Perhaps the only practical use to which anagrams have been turned is to be found in the transpositions in which some of the [[astronomer]]s of the [[17th century]] embodied their discoveries with the design apparently of avoiding the risk that, while they were engaged in further verification, the credit of what they had found out might be claimed by others.  Thus [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] announced his discovery that [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] had [[Moon phase|phase]]s like the [[Moon]] in the form &quot;Haec immatura a me iam frustra leguntur&amp;mdash;oy&quot; (Latin: ''This immature (feminine) one has already been read in vain by me&amp;mdash;oy'' (with a subject-verb number agreement error)), that is, &quot;Cynthiae figuras aemulatur Mater Amorum&quot; (Latin: ''The Mother of Loves [= Venus] imitates the figures of [[Cynthia]] [= the moon]'').  Similarly, when [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[Hooke's law]] in 1660, he first published it in anagram form.  One might think of this as a primitive example of a [[zero-knowledge proof]].

There are also a few &quot;natural&quot; anagrams, English words unconsciously created by switching letters around. The French ''chaise longue'' (&quot;long chair&quot;) became the American &quot;[[chaise lounge]]&quot; by metathesis (transposition of letters and/or sounds). This is an example of [[folk etymology]]. It has also been speculated that the English &quot;curd&quot; comes from the Latin ''crudus'' (&quot;raw&quot;).

==Methods==
Before the computer age, anagrams were constructed using a pen and paper or lettered tiles, by playing with letter combinations and experimenting with variations.  (Some individuals with prodigious talent have also been known to âseeâ anagrams in words, unaided by tools.)

Computers have enabled a new method of creating anagrams, the anagram server. An anagram server utilizes an exhaustive database of words. The anagrammist (one who creates anagrams) enters a word or phrase into the serverâs search engine, and the server produces a list containing every possible combination of words or phrases from the input word or phrase. Anagram servers use advanced features to control the search results, by excluding or including certain words, limiting the number or length of words in each anagram, or limiting the number of results.

When sharing their newly discovered anagrams with other enthusiasts, some anagrammists indicate the method they used.  Anagrams constructed without aid of a computer are noted as having been done âmanuallyâ or âby handâ; those made by utilizing a computer may be noted âby machineâ or âby computerâ, or may indicate the name of the computer program (using âAnagram Geniusâ).

Anagram servers are available on the Internet.  Some examples are

==Crosswords==
[[Cryptic crossword]] puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues, usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a word like &quot;confused&quot; or &quot;in disarray&quot;. An example would be '''Businessman burst into tears (9 letters)'''; the solution, '''Stationer''' is an anagram of '''into tears''', the letters of which have '''burst''' out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of '''businessman'''.

What is the most anagrammable name on record? There must be few names as deliciously workable as that of &quot;[[Augustus de Morgan]]&quot; who tells that a friend had constructed about 800 on his name (specimens of which are given in his ''Budget of Paradoxes'', p. 82)!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anadyr''' (''ÐÐ½Ð°ÌÐ´ÑÑÑ'') is a [[river]] in the extreme northeast of [[Siberia]], [[Russia]].

The river, taking its rise in the [[Stanovoi Mountains]] as the Ivashki or Ivachno, about 67Â°N latitude and 173Â°E longitude, flows through the [[Chukotka]], at first southwest and then east, and enters the Gulf of Anadyr after a course of about 500 miles. The country through which it passes is thinly populated, and is dominated by [[tundra]], which is rich with a variety of plant life. Much of the region is folded in rugged mountains, and is a beautiful landscape. For nine months of the year the ground is covered with snow, and the frozen rivers become navigable roads. [[Reindeer]], upon which the inhabitants subsist, were once found in considerable numbers, but the domestic reindeer population has collapsed dramatically since the reorganization and privatization of state-run collective farms beginning in [[1992]]. As herds of domestic reindeer have declined, herds of wild [[caribou]] have increased.

'''AndrÃ©-Marie AmpÃ¨re''' ([[January 20]] [[1775]] &amp;ndash; [[June 10]] [[1836]]), was a French [[physicist]] who is generally credited as one of the main discoverers of [[electromagnetism]]. The [[ampere]] unit of measurement of [[Current (electricity)|electric current]] is named after him.

==Early days==
AmpÃ¨re was born in [[Lyon]], near his father's country house in [[Poleymieux]] and, as a [[child prodigy]], took a passionate delight in the pursuit of knowledge from his very infancy, and is reported to have worked out long arithmetical sums by means of pebbles and biscuit crumbs before he knew the figures. His father began to teach him [[Latin]], but ceased on discovering the boy's greater inclination and aptitude for mathematical studies. The young AmpÃ¨re, however, soon resumed his Latin lessons, to enable him to master the works of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]]. 

In later life he was accustomed to say that he knew as much about mathematics when he was eighteen as ever he knew; but, a [[polymath]], his reading embraced nearly the whole round of knowledge &amp;mdash; history, travels, poetry, philosophy and the natural sciences.  

In [[1796]] he met Julie Carron, and an attachment sprang up between them. In [[1799]] they were married. From about 1796 AmpÃ¨re gave private lessons at Lyons in [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]] and languages; and in [[1801]] he removed to Bourg, as professor of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], leaving his ailing wife and infant son ([[Jean Jacques AmpÃ¨re]]) at Lyon. She died in 1804, and he never recovered from her death. In the same year he was appointed professor of mathematics at the ''[[lycÃ©e]]'' of Lyon.

==Contributions to physics and further studies==
[[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre]]'s recommendation obtained for him the Lyon appointment, and afterwards ([[1804]]) a subordinate position in the polytechnic school at Paris, where he was appointed professor of mathematics in 1809. Here he continued to pursue his scientific research and his diverse studies with unabated diligence.  He was admitted as a member of the Institute in [[1814]].  

AmpÃ¨re's fame mainly rests on the service that he rendered to science in establishing the relations between electricity and magnetism, and in developing the science of electromagnetism, or, as he called it, electrodynamics.  On [[September 11]], [[1820]] he heard of [[Hans Christian Ãrsted|H. C. Ãrsted's]] discovery that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current.  Only a week later, on [[September 18]], he presented a paper to the Academy containing a far more complete exposition of that and kindred phenomena.

==Legacy and final days==
The whole field thus opened up he explored with characteristic industry and care, and developed a mathematical theory which not only explained the electromagnetic phenomena already observed but also predicted many new ones.  

He died at [[Marseille]] and is buried in the [[CimetiÃ¨re de Montmartre]], Paris. The great amiability and childlike simplicity of AmpÃ¨re's character are well brought out in his ''Journal et correspondance'' (Paris, [[1872]]). Forty-five years later, mathematicians recognized him.

'''''Amoeba''''' (also spelled '''''ameba''''') is a genus of [[protozoa]] that moves by means of temporary projections called [[pseudopods]], and is well-known as a representative unicellular organism.  The word amoeba is variously used to refer to it and its close relatives, now grouped as the [[Amoebozoa]], or to all protozoa that move using pseudopods, otherwise termed [[amoeboid]]s.  See those pages for further information.

''Amoeba'' itself is found in freshwater, typically on decaying vegetation from streams, but is not especially common in nature.  However, because of the ease with which they may be obtained and kept in the lab, they are common objects of study, both as representative protozoa and to demonstrate cell structure and function.  The cells have several lobose pseudopods, with one large tubular pseudopod at the anterior and several secondary ones branching to the sides. The most famous species, ''A. proteus'', is 700-800 &amp;mu;m in length, but many others are much smaller.  Each has a single [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], and a simple contractile [[vacuole]] which maintains its [[osmosis|osmotic]] pressure, as its most recognizable features.

Early naturalists referred to ''Amoeba'' as the [[Proteus]] [[animalcule]], after a Greek god who could change his shape.  The name &quot;amibe&quot; was given to it by Bery St. Vincent, from the Greek ''amoibe'', meaning change.

A good method of collecting amoeba is to lower a jar upside down until it is just above the sediment surface. Then slowly let air escape so the top layer will be sucked into the jar. Try not to allow deeper sediment get sucked in. You can slowly move the jar when tilting it so you collect from a larger area. If no amoeba are found, one can try introducing some rice grains into the jar and waiting for them to start to rot. The bacteria eating the rice will be eaten by the amoeba, thus increasing the population and making them easier to find. 

==''Amoeba'' in popular culture==

* The North American writer [[Tom Robbins]] states, in the [[preface]] to his book [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]], that amoebas are [[cool]] because they [[reproduce]] by [[binary fission]], so the first amoeba is still alive to this day.
* In the [[1984]] computer game [[Boulder Dash]], Rockford, the main character, is chased all the time by a constantly-growing amoeba.
* In certain places of [[Brazil]], the term amoeba (in its [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] form: ''ameba'') is used as a [[derogatory]] [[slang]] for &quot;slow, [[obtuse]] person&quot;.

'''Ammonia''' is a [[chemical compound|compound]] of [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. At [[standard temperature and pressure]] ammonia is a [[gas]]. It is [[toxic]] and [[corrosive]] to some materials, and has a characteristic pungent [[odor]]. 

An ammonia molecule has a [[Trigonal pyramid (chemistry)|trigonal pyramid]] shape, as would be expected from [[VSEPR theory]]. This shape gives the molecule an overall [[dipole]] moment and makes it [[Polar molecule|polar]] so that ammonia very readily dissolves in [[Water (molecule)|water]]. The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a [[Lone pair|lone electron pair]], and ammonia acts as a [[Base (chemistry)|base]]. That means that, when in aqueous solution, it can take a [[proton]] from water; this produces a [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] and an [[ammonium]] [[cation]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), which has the shape of a regular tetrahedron. The degree to which ammonia forms the ammonium ion depends on the [[pH]] of the [[solution]]âat &quot;physiological&quot; pH (~7), about 99% of the ammonia molecules are protonated.

The main uses of ammonia are in the production of [[fertilizer]]s, [[explosive]]s and [[polymer]]s. It is also an ingredient in certain household glass cleaners. Ammonia is found in small quantities in the atmosphere, being produced from the [[putrefaction]] of nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter. Ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater, while [[ammonium chloride]] (sal-ammoniac) and ammonium sulfate are found in volcanic districts; crystals of [[ammonium bicarbonate]] have been found in [[Patagonia]]n [[guano]]. Ammonium salts also are found distributed through all fertile soil and in seawater. Substances containing ammonia or that are similar to it are called ammoniacal.

== History ==

Salts of ammonia have been known from very early times; thus the term ''Hammoniacus sal'' appears in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], although it is not known whether the term is identical with the more modern ''sal-ammoniac''. 

In the form of sal-ammoniac, ammonia was known to the [[alchemy|alchemists]] as early as the [[13th century]], being mentioned by [[Albertus Magnus]]. It was also used by [[dyer]]s in the [[Middle Ages]] in the form of fermented [[urine]] to alter the colour of vegetable dyes. In the [[15th century]], [[Basilius Valentinus]] showed that ammonia could be obtained by the action of alkalis on sal-ammoniac. At a later period, when sal-ammoniac was obtained by distilling the hoofs and horns of oxen and neutralizing the resulting carbonate with [[hydrochloric acid]], the name '''Spirit of hartshorn''' was applied to ammonia. 

Gaseous ammonia was first isolated by [[Joseph Priestley]] in [[1774]] and was termed by him ''alkaline air''. In [[1777]] [[Karl Wilhelm Scheele]] showed that it contained [[nitrogen]], and [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], in about [[1785]], ascertained its composition.

The [[Haber process]] to produce ammonia from the nitrogen contained in the air was developed by [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]] in [[1909]] and patented in [[1910]]. It was first used on an industrial scale by the Germans during [[World War I]]. The ammonia was used to produce explosives to sustain their war effort.

== Synthesis and production ==
Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly-produced inorganic chemicals. 
Today NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is manufactured by the [[Haber process]]. In this process, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; combine in the presence of an [[iron]] [[catalyst]] at a pressure of 200&amp;nbsp;bar (20&amp;nbsp;MPa, 3000&amp;nbsp;lbf/inÂ²) and a temperature of 500 Â°C. A molybdenum [[promoter]] may also be used.

::N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; â 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Compared to older methods, the feedstocks of the Haber process are relatively inexpensive&amp;mdash;nitrogen makes up 78% of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], while hydrogen is produced in situ from [[natural gas|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].  Thus, the industrial process entails heating air and natural gas, a by-product is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Before the start of WWI most ammonia was obtained by the dry [[distillation]] of nitrogenous vegetable and animal products; by the reduction of [[nitrous acid]] and [[nitrite]]s with [[hydrogen]]; and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by alkaline hydroxides or by [[calcium oxide|quicklime]], the salt most generally used being the chloride ([[ammonium chloride|sal-ammoniac]]) thus

::2NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + 2CaO â CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

It can also been obtained by the hydrolysis of many metal nitrides, for example,

::Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O â 3Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

==Biosynthesis==
Ammonia is produced from atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by enzymes called [[nitrogenase]]s.  The overall process is called [[nitrogen fixation]].   Although it is unlikely that biomimetic methods will be developed that are competitive with the [[Haber process]], intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation. The scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;MoS&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; ensemble.

Ammonia is also a metabolic product of [[amino acid]] [[deamination]]. In humans, it is quickly converted to [[urea]], which is much less toxic. This urea is a major component of the dry weight of [[urine]].
== Properties ==

Ammonia is a colourless [[gas]] with a characteristic pungent smell; it is [[lighter than air]], its density being 0.589 times that of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. It is easily liquefied and the [[liquid]] boils at -33.7 Â°C, and solidifies at -75 Â°C to a mass of white crystals. [[Liquid]] ammonia possesses strong [[ion]]izing powers ([[Dielectric constant|Îµ]] = 22), and [[solution]]s of [[salt]]s in liquid ammonia have been much studied. Liquid ammonia has a very high [[standard enthalpy change of vaporization]] (23.35&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, ''c.f.'' [[water (molecule)|water]] 40.65&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, [[methane]] 8.19&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, [[phosphine]] 14.6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) and can therefore be used in laboratories in non-insulated vessels at room temperature, even though it is well above its boiling point. 

It is [[miscible]] with water. All the ammonia contained in an aqueous solution of the gas may be expelled by boiling. The [[water|aqueous]] solution of ammonia is [[Base (chemistry)|basic]]. The maximum concentration of ammonia in water (a [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] solution) has a [[density]] of 0.880 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; and is often known as '.880 Ammonia'.

It does not sustain [[combustion]], and it does not burn readily unless mixed with [[oxygen]], when it burns with a pale yellowish-green flame.

At high temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst, ammonia is decomposed into its constituent elements.  [[Chlorine]] catches fire when passed into ammonia, forming [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrochloric acid]]; unless the ammonia is present in excess, the highly explosive [[nitrogen trichloride]] (NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is also formed. 

The ammonia molecule readily undergoes [[nitrogen inversion]] at normal pressures, that is to say that the nitrogen atom passes through the plane of the three hydrogen atoms as if it were an umbrella turning inside out in a strong wind. The energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol in ammonia, and the [[resonance frequency]] is 23.79&amp;nbsp;GHz, corresponding to [[microwave]] radiation of a [[wavelength]] of 1.260&amp;nbsp;cm. The absorption at this frequency was the first [[Microwave spectroscopy|microwave spectrum]] to be observed (C.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Cleeton&amp;nbsp;&amp; N.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;Williams, [[1934]]).

=== Formation of salts ===

One of the most characteristic properties of ammonia is its power of combining directly with [[acid]]s to form [[salt]]s; thus with [[hydrochloric acid]] it forms [[ammonium chloride]] (sal-ammoniac); with [[nitric acid]], [[ammonium nitrate]], etc. However perfectly dry ammonia will not combine with perfectly dry [[hydrogen chloride]], moisture being necessary to bring about the reaction.{{ref|NH4Cl}}
::NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]]  â  [[Ammonium chloride|NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]]

The salts produced by the action of ammonia on acids are known as the [[:Category:Ammonium compounds|ammonium salts]] and all contain the [[ammonium]] [[ion]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).

=== Acidity ===

Although ammonia is well-known as a base, it can also act as an extremely weak [[acid]]. It is a protic substance, and is capable of dissociation into the '''amide''' (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;) ion, for example  when solid lithium nitride is added to liquid ammonia, forming a lithium amide solution:

Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N(s)+ 2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(l) &amp;rarr; 3Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(am) + 3NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(am).

This is a Bronsted-Lowry acid-base reaction in which ammonia is acting as an acid.

=== Formation of other compounds ===

Ammonia can act as a [[nucleophile]] in [[Nucleophilic substitution|substitution]] reactions. [[Amine]]s can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with [[alkyl halide]]s, although the resulting &amp;ndash;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as by-products. Using an excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution, and neutralises the hydrogen halide formed. [[Methylamine]] is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with [[chloromethane]], and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare [[racemic]] [[alanine]] in 70% yield. [[Ethanolamine]] is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with [[ethylene oxide]]: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce diethanolamine and triethanolamine.

[[Amide]]s can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with a number of [[carboxylic acid]] derivatives. [[Acyl chloride]]s are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present in at least a two-fold excess to neutralise the [[hydrogen chloride]] formed. [[Ester]]s and [[anhydride]]s also react with ammonia to form amides.

Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be dehydrated to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150&amp;ndash;200 Â°C are required.

The [[hydrogen]] in ammonia is capable of replacement by [[metal]]s, thus [[magnesium]] burns in the gas with the formation of [[magnesium nitride]] Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and when the gas is passed over heated [[sodium]] or [[potassium]], sodamide, NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and potassamide, KNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are formed.

Where necessary in [[IUPAC nomenclature|substitutive nomenclature]], [[IUPAC]] recommendations prefer the name '''azane''' to ammonia: hence [[chloramine]] would be named ''chloroazane'' in substitutive nomenclature, not ''chloroammonia''.

=== Ammonia as a ligand ===

Ammonia can act as a [[ligand]] in [[transition metal]] [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]]. It is a pure Ï-donor, in the middle of the [[spectrochemical series]], and shows intermediate [[HSAB concept|hard-soft]] behaviour. For historical reasons, ammonia is named '''ammine''' in the nomenclature of [[coordination compound]]s. Some notable ammine complexes include:
*'''Hexamminecopper(II)''', [Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, a characteristic dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to solution of copper(II) salts.
*'''Diamminesilver(I)''', [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the active species in [[Tollens' reagent]]. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: [[Silver chloride|AgCl]] is soluble in dilute (2&amp;nbsp;M) ammonia solution, [[Silver bromide|AgBr]] is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution while [[Silver iodide|AgI]] is insoluble in aqueous solution of ammonia.

Ammine complexes of [[chromium]](III) were known in the late 19th century, and formed the basis of [[Alfred Werner]]'s theory of coordination compounds. Werner noted that only two isomers (''fac''- and ''mer''-) of the complex [CrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] could be formed, and concluded that the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the [[vertex|vertices]] of an [[octahedron]]. This has since been confirmed by [[X-ray crystallography]].

An ammine ligand bound to a metal ion is markedly more [[acid]]ic than a free ammonia molecule, although deprotonation in aqueous solution is still rare. One example is the [[Mercury(I) chloride|Calomel reaction]], where the resulting amidomercury(II) compound is highly insoluble.
::Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; â Hg + HgCl(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;

==Uses==

The most important single use of ammonia is in the production of [[nitric acid]]. A mixture of one part ammonia to nine parts air is passed over a [[platinum]] gauze [[catalyst]] at 850 Â°C, whereupon the ammonia is oxidized to [[nitric oxide]].
::4NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; â 4NO + 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The catalyst is essential, as the normal oxidation (or combustion) of ammonia gives [[Nitrogen|dinitrogen]] and water: the production of nitric oxide is an example of [[kinetic control]]. As the gas mixture cools to 200&amp;ndash;250 Â°C, the nitric oxide is in turn oxidized by the excess of [[oxygen]] present in the mixture, to give [[nitrogen dioxide]]. This is reacted with water to give nitric acid for use in the production of [[fertilizer]]s and [[explosive]]s.

In addition to serving as a fertilizer ingredient, ammonia can also be used directly as a fertilizer by forming a solution with irrigation water, without additional chemical processing. This later use allows the continuous growing of nitrogen dependent crops such as [[maize]] (corn) without [[agriculture|crop]] rotation but this type of use leads to poor [[soil]] health.

Ammonia has thermodynamic properties that make it very well suited as a [[Refrigeration|refrigerant]], since it liquefies readily under pressure, and was used in virtually all refrigeration units prior to the advent of [[haloalkane]]s such as [[Freon]]. However, ammonia is a toxic irritant and its corrosiveness to any [[copper]] [[alloy]]s increases the risk that an undesirable leak may develop and cause a noxious hazard.  Its use in small refrigeration units has been largely replaced by haloalkanes, which are not toxic irritants and are practically not [[flammable]].  (Note: [[Butane]] and [[isobutane]], which have very suitable thermodynamic properties for refrigerants, are extremely flammable.)  Ammonia continues to be used as a [[refrigerant]] in large industrial processes such as bulk icemaking and industrial food processing. Ammonia is also useful as a component in [[Absorptive refrigeration|absorption-type refrigerators]], which do not use compression and expansion cycles but can exploit heat differences. Since the implication of haloalkane being major contributors to [[ozone depletion]], ammonia is again seeing increasing use as a refrigerant.

Ammonia is a primary ingredient in old-style household cleaners.

It is also sometimes added to drinking water along with [[chlorine]] to form [[chloramine]], a [[disinfectant]]. Unlike chlorine on its own, chloramine does not combine with organic (carbon containing) materials to form [[carcinogen|carcinogenic]] [[halomethane]]s such as [[chloroform]].

== Liquid ammonia as a solvent ==
:''See also: [[Inorganic nonaqueous solvent]]''
Liquid ammonia is the best-known and most widely studied non-aqueous ionizing solvent. Its most conspicuous property is its ability to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured, electrically conducting solutions containing solvated electrons. Apart from these remarkable solutions, much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions. Comparison of the physical properties of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with those of water shows that NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, [[viscosity]], [[dielectric constant]] and [[electrical conductivity]]; this is due at least in part to the weaker H bonding in NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the fact that such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks since each NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule has only 1 lone-pair of electrons compared with 2 for each H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule. The ionic self-[[dissociation constant]] of liquid NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at &amp;minus;50 Â°C is approx. 10&lt;sup&gt;-33&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Â·l&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Liquid ammonia is an ionizing solvent, although less so than water, and dissolves a range of ionic compounds including many [[nitrate]]s, [[nitrite]]s, [[cyanide]]s and [[thiocyanate]]s.  Most [[ammonium]] salts are soluble, and these salts act as [[acid]]s in liquid ammonia solutions. The solubility of [[halide]] salts increases from [[fluoride]] to [[iodide]]. A saturated solution of [[ammonium nitrate]] contains 0.83&amp;nbsp;mol solute per mole of ammonia, and has a [[vapour pressure]] of less than 1&amp;nbsp;bar even at 25 Â°C.

=== Solutions of metals ===
:''See also: [[Solvated electron]], [[metallic solution]]''
Liquid ammonia will dissolve the [[alkali metal]]s and other [[Electronegativity|electropositive]] metals such as [[Calcium|Ca]], [[Strontium|Sr]], [[Barium|Ba]] [[Europium|Eu]] and [[Ytterbium|Yb]]. At low concentrations (&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.06&amp;nbsp;mol/L), deep blue solutions are formed: these contain metal cations and [[solvated electron]]s, free electrons which are surrounded by a cage of ammonia molecules. These solutions are very useful as strong reducing agents. At higher concentrations, the solutions are metallic in appearance and in electrical conductivity. At low temperatures, the two types of solution can coexist as [[Wiktionary:immiscible|immiscible]] phases.

The range of thermodynamic stability of liquid ammonia solutions is very narrow, as the potential for oxidation to [[Nitrogen|dinitrogen]], ''E''Â°&amp;nbsp;(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}} 8NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is only +0.04&amp;nbsp;V. In practice, both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to [[Hydrogen|dihydrogen]] are slow. This is particularly true of reducing solutions: the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days, slowly decomposing to the [[Amide|metal amide]] and dihydrogen. Most studies involving liquid ammonia solutions are done in reducing conditions: although oxidation of liquid ammonia is usually slow, there is still a risk of explosion, particularly if transition metal ions are present as possible catalysts.

== Detection and determination ==

Ammonia and ammonium salts can be readily detected, in very minute traces, by the addition of [[Nessler's solution]], which gives a distinct yellow coloration in the presence of the least trace of ammonia or ammonium salts. [[Sulfur sticks]] are burnt to detect small leaks in industrial ammonia refrigeration systems. Larger quantities can be detected by warming the salts with a caustic alkali or with [[calcium oxide|quicklime]], when the characteristic smell of ammonia will be at once apparent. The amount of ammonia in ammonium salts can be estimated quantitatively by distillation of the salts with [[sodium hydroxide|sodium]] or [[potassium hydroxide]], the ammonia evolved being absorbed in a known volume of standard [[sulfuric acid]] and the excess of acid then determined [[volumetric analysis|volumetrically]]; or the ammonia may be absorbed in [[hydrochloric acid]] and the [[ammonium chloride]] so formed precipitated as [[ammonium hexachloroplatinate]], (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Safety precautions ==
=== Toxicity ===

The toxicity of ammonia solutions does not usually cause problems for humans and other mammals, as a specific mechanism exists to prevent its build-up  in the bloodstream. Ammonia is converted to [[carbamoyl phosphate]] by the enzyme [[carbamoyl phosphate synthase]], and then enters the [[urea cycle]] to be either incorporated into [[amino acid]]s or excreted in the urine. However [[fish]] and [[amphibian]]s lack this mechanism, as they can usually eliminate ammonia from their bodies by direct excretion. Ammonia even at dilute concentrations is highly toxic to aquatic animals, and for this reason it is [[Directive 67/548/EEC|classified]] as ''dangerous for the environment''.

=== Household use ===

Solutions of ammonia (5&amp;ndash;10% by weight) are used as household cleaners, particularly for glass. These solutions are irritating to the eyes and [[mucous membrane]]s (respiratory and digestive tracts), and to a lesser extent the skin. They should '''never''' be mixed with [[chlorine]]-containing products, for example household [[bleach]], as a variety of toxic and [[carcinogen]]ic compounds are formed (''e.g.'', [[chloramine]], [[hydrazine]]).

=== Laboratory use of ammonia solutions ===

The hazards of ammonia solutions depend on the concentration: &quot;dilute&quot; ammonia solutions are usually 5&amp;ndash;10% by weight (&lt;5.62&amp;nbsp;mol/L); &quot;concentrated&quot; solutions are usually prepared at &gt;25% by weight. A 25% (by weight) solution has a density of 0.907&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and a solution which has a lower density will be more concentrated. The [[Directive 67/548/EEC|European Union classification]] of ammonia solutions is given in the table.

The ammonia vapour from concentrated ammonia solutions is severely irritating to the eyes and the respiratory tract, and these solutions should only be handled in a fume hood. Saturated (&quot;0.880&quot;) solutions can develop a significant pressure inside a closed bottle in warm weather, and the bottle should be opened with care: this is not usually a problem for 25% (&quot;0.900&quot;) solutions.

Ammonia solutions should not be mixed with [[halogen]]s, as toxic and/or explosive products are formed. Prolonged contact of ammonia solutions with [[silver (element)|silver]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[iodide]] salts can also lead to explosive products: such mixtures are often formed in [[qualitative analysis]], and should be acidified and diluted before disposal once the test is completed.

=== Laboratory use of anhydrous ammonia (gas or liquid) ===

&lt;!-- EU index no. 007-001-00-5 --&gt;
&lt;!-- R10, 23, 34, 50; S1/2, 9, 16, 26, 36/37/39, 45, 61 --&gt;
Anhydrous ammonia is classified as '''toxic''' ('''T''') and '''dangerous for the environment''' ('''N'''). The gas is flammable ([[autoignition temperature]]: 651 Â°C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16&amp;ndash;25%). The [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) in the United States is 50&amp;nbsp;ppm (35&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), while the [[IDLH]] concentration is estimated at 300&amp;nbsp;ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to the smell of the gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 0.5&amp;nbsp;ppm, but desensitized individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100&amp;nbsp;ppm.

Ammonia reacts violently with the halogens, and causes the explosive polymerization of [[ethylene oxide]]. It also forms explosive compounds with compounds of [[gold (element)|gold]], silver, mercury, [[germanium]] or [[tellurium]], and with [[stibine]]. Violent reactions have also been reported with [[acetaldehyde]], [[hypochlorite]] solutions, [[potassium ferricyanide]] and [[peroxide]]s.

Anhydrous ammonia corrodes [[copper (element)|copper]]- and [[zinc (element)|zinc]]-containing [[alloy]]s, and so [[brass]] fittings should not be used for handling the gas. Liquid ammonia can also attack rubber and certain plastics.

'''Amethyst''' (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a violet or purple variety of [[quartz]] often used as an [[ornamental stone|ornament]]. The name is generally said to be derived from the Greek ''a'', &quot;not,&quot; and ''methuskein'', &quot;to intoxicate,&quot; expressing the old belief that the stone protected its owner from [[drunkenness]]. It was held that wine drunk out of a cup of amethyst would not [[Intoxication|intoxicate]]. However, the word may probably be a corruption of an Oriental name for the stone. 

[[Image:Amethyst.bed.750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A bed of amethyst crystals on base rock, 13cm (5in) long]]

In the [[20th century]], the color of amethyst was attributed to the presence of [[manganese]]. However, since it is capable of being greatly altered and even discharged by heat, the color was believed by some authorities to be from an organic source. [[Iron|Ferric]] [[thiocyanate]] was suggested, and [[sulfur]] was said to have been detected in the mineral. As of 2005, impurity atoms are known to be responsible of the colour of the amethyst.

On exposure to heat, amethyst generally becomes yellow, and much of the [[citrine]], [[cairngorm]], or yellow quartz of jewelry is said to be merely &quot;burnt amethyst&quot;. Veins of amethystine quartz are apt to lose their color on the exposed outcrop. 

Amethyst is composed of an irregular superposition of alternate [[lamellar structure|lamellae]] of right-handed and left-handed quartz. It has been shown that this structure may be due to mechanical stresses.  As a consequence of this composite formation, amethyst is apt to break with a rippled fracture, or to show &quot;thumb markings&quot;, and the intersection of two sets of curved ripples may produce on the fractured surface a pattern something like that of &quot;engine turning&quot;. Some mineralogists, following Sir [[David Brewster]], apply the name of amethyst to all quartz which exhibits this structure, regardless of color. 

[[Image:Amethyst cut.jpg|Amethyst|thumb|250px]]
Amethyst was used as a [[gemstone]] by the ancient [[Egypt]]ians and was largely employed in antiquity for [[intaglio]]s. Beads of amethyst are found in [[Anglo-Saxon]] graves in [[England]]. It is a widely distributed [[mineral]], but fine, clear specimens that are suitable for cutting as ornamental stones are confined to comparatively few localities. Such [[crystal]]s occur either in the cavities of mineral-veins and in [[granite|granitic]] rocks, or as a lining in [[agate]] [[geode]]s. A huge geode, or &quot;amethyst-grotto&quot;, from near Santa Cruz in southern [[Brazil]] was exhibited at the [[DÃ¼sseldorf]] Exhibition of [[1902]].  Many of the hollow agates of Brazil and [[Uruguay]] contain a crop of amethyst crystals in the interior. Much fine amethyst comes from [[Russia]], especially from  near [[Mursinka]] in the [[Ekaterinburg]] district, where it occurs in drusy cavities in granitic rocks. Many localities in [[India]] yield amethyst; and it is found also in [[Sri Lanka]], chiefly as pebbles.

[[Image:Srr046a.jpg|6 Carat Pear Shape Amethyst Ring|thumb|250px]]
Due to its popularity as a gemstone, several descriptive terms have been coined in the gem trade to describe the varying colors of amethyst.  &quot;Rose de France&quot; is usually a pale pinkish lavender or lilac shade (usually the least sought color).  The most prized color is an intense violet with red flashes and is called &quot;Siberian&quot;, although gems of this color may occur from several locations other than [[Siberia]], notably [[Uruguay]] and [[Zambia]]. In more recent times, certain gems (usually of Bolivian origin) that have shown alternate bands of amethyst purple with citrine orange have been given the name [[ametrine]].

Purple [[corundum]], or [[sapphire]] of amethystine tint, is called Oriental amethyst, but this expression is often applied by jewellers to fine examples of the ordinary amethystine quartz, even when not derived from eastern sources. Professional gemological associations, such as the [[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA) or the [[American Gemological Society]] (AGS), discourage the use of the term &quot;Oriental amethyst&quot; to describe any gem, as it may be misleading.

Amethyst occurs at many localities in the [[United States]], but these specimens are rarely fine enough for use in jewelry. Among these may be mentioned Amethyst Mountain, [[Texas]]; [[Yellowstone National Park]]; [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania]]; [[Haywood County, North Carolina]]; and Deer Hill, and Stow, [[Maine]]. It is found also in the [[Lake Superior]] district. Amethyst is relatively common in northwestern [[Ontario]], but uncommon elsewhere in [[Canada]]; it was selected as the provincial mineral of Ontario in 1975.

==Value==
Traditionally included in the cardinal, or most valuable, gemstones (along with [[diamond]], [[sapphire]], [[ruby]] and [[emerald]]), amethyst has lost much of its substantial value due to the discovery of extensive deposits in locations such as [[Brazil]]. Even high-quality examples are often sold in large unfinished slabs, or as geodes, in everyday locations.

==Amethyst in folklore and astrology==
Amethyst is the [[birthstone]] associated with February. It is also associated with the [[constellation]]s of [[Pisces]], [[Aries]] (especially the violet and purple variety), [[Aquarius]], and [[Sagittarius]]. It is a symbol of heavenly understanding, and of the pioneer in thought and action on the philosophical, religious, spiritual and material planes. Ranking members of the [[Catholic]] Church traditionally wear rings set with a large amethyst as part of their office.

'''''Albertosaurus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[tyrannosaurid]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Late Cretaceous]] Period of [[North America]]. It was a large [[bipedal]] [[predator]] with a massive head and tiny forelimbs, much like the better-known ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', although not quite as big. Adults reached up to 30 feet (9 meters) in length.

==Etymology==

The genus ''Albertosaurus'' can be translated as &quot;Alberta lizard&quot; and is named for the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Alberta]], in which it was found. The name also incorporates the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''sauros'', meaning &quot;lizard,&quot; which is the most common suffix used in dinosaur names.

There is one named [[species]] considered valid today (''A. sarcophagus''). This name has the same [[etymology]] as the [[sarcophagus|funeral container]] of the same name: a combination of the Greek words ''sarx'', meaning &quot;flesh,&quot; and ''phagos'', meaning &quot;to eat.&quot; This refers to its quite obvious carnivorous habits.

Both genus and species were named by famous [[United States|American]] [[paleontologist]] [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] in [[1905]].

==Taxonomy==

''Albertosaurus'' is a member of the family [[Tyrannosauridae]] and is united with the closely related ''Gorgosaurus'' in the subfamily [[Albertosaurinae]]. Holtz (2004) also places the newly described ''[[Appalachiosaurus]]'' in this subfamily, while Carr et al. (2005) do not.

===Invalid Species===

Other species have been named. ''A. arctunguis'', also from Alberta, was found to be a [[junior synonym]] of ''A. sarcophagus'' by Russell (1970). ''A. megagracilis'' (later renamed ''[[Dinotyrannus]]''), is a smaller animal from the [[Hell Creek Formation]] of [[Montana]], and is now thought to be a juvenile ''Tyrannosaurus''.

===Synonymy with Gorgosaurus?===

In [[1970]], [[Dale Russell]] examined [[fossil]]s of both ''Albertosaurus'' and another tyrannosaurid, ''[[Gorgosaurus]]'', which comes from slightly older sediments, and found very few differences to separate them. While retaining the two as different species, he assigned them to the same genus. ''Gorgosaurus libratus'' was not named until [[1914]], so the name ''Albertosaurus'' retained [[ICZN|priority]] as the genus name since it was older, creating the new combination ''Albertosaurus libratus''. 

This name found common use for a few decades, but a recent reanalysis of tyrannosaurid [[skull]]s performed by influential paleontologist [[Phil Currie]] in [[2003]] found that the differences are more pronounced than previously thought, although the two species are still closely related. As ''Albertosaurus'' and ''Gorgosaurus'' are considered [[sister taxa]], and there is no commonly accepted definition of a genus in paleontology, Currie acknowledged that the difference between retaining them in one genus or separating them into two is largely arbitrary. However, he recommended separating them to allow more flexibility when naming new species in the future, and because there is no greater degree of difference between the two than there is between ''[[Daspletosaurus]]'' and ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', which are almost universally retained as different genera. Other paleontologists, with the exception of Carr et al. (2005), have largely followed Currie's recommendation on the subject and ''Gorgosaurus'' is now widely recognized as a separate genus.

==Location and Age==

''Albertosaurus'' is known mostly from the [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. This [[geologic formation|formation]] is from the early [[Maastrichtian]] stage of the [[Late Cretaceous]] Period, about 73 to 70 million years ago. Many other dinosaurs have been found there, including [[ornithomimidae|ornithomimids]], ''[[Chirostenotes]]'', [[dromaeosaurid]]s, [[ankylosauria]]ns, [[ceratopsia]]ns, [[pachycephalosaur]]s, and [[hadrosaurids]].

Fossils of ''Albertosaurus'' have also been reported from the [[United States|American]] states of Montana and [[Wyoming]], but these are not recognizable to species level according to Currie (2003) and Holtz (2004).

==Remains==

[[Image:Dd albertos 300.jpg|frame|Albertosaurus]]

Currie (2003) recognized ten skulls which belong to ''A. sarcophagus'' with certainty, as well as seven skeletons of varying completeness. The [[holotype]] skull was found by famous Canadian [[geologist]] [[Joseph Tyrrell|Joseph B. Tyrrell]].

===Bonebed in Alberta===

In addition, articulated remains of 12 more individuals of all different ages have been recovered from a [[bonebed]] locality in Alberta, providing a nearly complete sequence from juvenile to very old adults. This is now one of the most completely known tyrannosaurid species.

It is possible that such a large number of individuals in one place represents some sort of [[social behavior]] among albertosaurs, but this is difficult to prove.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Assembly language''' commonly called '''assembly''' or '''asm''', is a [[human-readable]] notation for the [[machine language]] that a specific [[computer architecture]] uses. Machine language, a pattern of bits encoding machine operations, is made readable by replacing the raw values with symbols called ''mnemonics''.

For example, a computer with the appropriate processor will understand this [[x86]]/[[IA-32]] [[machine language]]:
 10110000 01100001
For programmers, however, it is easier to remember the equivalent assembly language representation:
 mov  al, 061h
which means to move the [[hexadecimal]] value 61 (97 [[decimal]]) into the [[processor register]] with the name &quot;al&quot;. The [[mnemonic]] &quot;mov&quot; is short for &quot;move&quot;, and a comma-separated list of arguments or parameters follows it; this is a typical assembly language statement.

Transforming assembly into machine language is accomplished by an [[assembler]], and the reverse by a [[disassembler]]. Unlike in [[high-level language]]s, there is usually a [[1-to-1]] correspondence between simple assembly statements and machine language instructions. However, in some cases an assembler may provide ''pseudoinstructions'' which expand into several machine language instructions to provide commonly needed functionality. For example, for a machine that lacks a &quot;branch if greater or equal&quot; instruction, an assembler may provide a pseudoinstruction that expands to the machine's &quot;set if less than&quot; and &quot;branch if zero (on the result of the set instruction)&quot;.

Every [[computer architecture]] has its own machine language, and therefore its own assembly language. Computers differ by the number and type of operations that they support. They may also have different sizes and numbers of registers, and different representations of data types in storage. While all general-purpose computers are able to carry out essentially the same functionality, the way they do it differs, and the corresponding assembly language must reflect these differences.

In addition, multiple sets of [[mnemonic|mnemonics]] or assembly-language syntax may exist for a single instruction set.  In these cases, the most popular one is usually that used by the manufacturer in their documentation.

==Machine instructions==
Instructions in assembly language are generally very simple, unlike in a [[high-level language]].  Any instruction that references memory (for data or as a jump target) will also have an [[addressing mode]] to determine how to calculate the required memory address.  More complex operations must be built up out of these simple operations.  Some operations available in most instruction sets include:
* moving
** set a [[processor register|register]] (a temporary &quot;scratchpad&quot; location in the CPU itself) to a fixed constant value
** move data from a memory location to a register, or vice versa.  This is done to obtain the data to perform a computation on it later, or to store the result of a computation.
** read and write data from hardware devices
* computing
** add, subtract, multiply, or divide the values of two registers, placing the result in a register
** perform [[bitwise operation]]s, taking the conjunction/disjunction (and/or) of corresponding bits in a pair of registers, or the negation (not) of each bit in a register
** compare two values in registers (for example, to see if one is less, or if they are equal)
* affecting program flow
** jump to another location in the program and execute instructions there
** jump to another location if a certain condition holds
** jump to another location, but save the location of the next instruction as a point to return to (a ''call'')

Some computers include one or more &quot;complex&quot; instructions in their instruction set. A single &quot;complex&quot; instruction does something that may take many instructions on other computers.  Such instructions are typified by instructions that take multiple steps, may issue to multiple functional units, or otherwise appear to be a design exception to the simplest instructions which are implemented for the given processor.  Some examples of such instruction include:

* saving many registers on the stack at once
* moving large blocks of memory
* complex and/or floating-point arithmetic ([[sine]], [[cosine]], [[square root]], etc.)
* performing an atomic [[test-and-set]] instruction
* instructions that combine ALU with an operand from memory rather than a register

A form of complex instructions that has become particularly popular recently are [[SIMD]] operations that perform the same arithmetic operation to multiple pieces of data at the same time, which have appeared under various trade names beginning with [[MMX]] and [[AltiVec]].

The design of instruction sets is a complex issue, with a simpler instruction set (generally grouped under the concept [[RISC]]) perhaps offering the potential for higher speeds, while a more complex one (traditionally called [[CISC]]) may offer particularly fast implementations of common performance-demanding tasks, may use memory (and thus [[cache]]) more efficiently, and be somewhat easier to program directly in assembly.  See [[instruction set]] for a fuller discussion of this point.

==Assembly language directives==
In addition to codes for machine instructions, assembly languages have extra directives for assembling blocks of data, and assigning address locations for instructions or code. 

They usually have a simple symbolic capability for defining values as symbolic expressions which are evaluated at assembly time, making it possible to write code that is easier to read and understand.

Like most computer languages, comments can be added to the [[source code]]; these often provide useful additional information to human readers of the code but are ignored by the assembler and so may be used freely.

They also usually have an embedded [[macro language]] to make it easier to generate complex pieces of code or data.

In practice, the absence of comments and the replacement of symbols with actual numbers makes the human interpretation of disassembled code considerably more difficult than the original (high level) source would be.

==Usage of assembly language==
Historically, a large number of programs have been written entirely in assembly language.  A classic example was the early IBM PC [[spreadsheet]] program [[Lotus 123]].  Even into the 1990s, the majority of console video games were written in assembly language, including most games written for the [[Sega Genesis]] and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]].  The popular arcade game [[NBA Jam]] (1993) was also coded entirely using assembly language.

There is some debate over the continued usefulness of assembly language. It is often said that modern compilers can render higher-level languages into codes that run as fast as hand-written assembly, but counter-examples can be made, and there is no clear consensus on this topic. It is reasonably certain that, given the increase in complexity of modern processors, effective hand-optimization is increasingly difficult and requires a great deal of knowledge.

However, some discrete calculations can still be rendered into faster running code with assembly, and some [[Low-level programming language|low-level]] programming is actually easier to do with assembly.  Some system-dependent tasks performed by [[operating system|operating systems]] simply cannot be expressed in high-level languages.  In particular, assembly is often used in writing the low level interaction between the operating system and the hardware, for instance in [[device driver|device drivers]].  Many compilers also render high-level languages into assembly first before fully compiling, allowing the assembly code to be viewed for debugging and optimization purposes.

It's also common, especially in relatively low-level languages such as [[C programming language|C]], to be able to embed assembly language into the source code with special syntax. Programs using such facilities, such as the [[Linux kernel]], often construct abstractions where different assembly language is used on each platform the program supports, but it is called by portable code through a uniform interface.

Many [[embedded system|embedded systems]] are also programmed in assembly to obtain the absolute maximum functionality out of what is often very limited computational resources, though this is gradually changing in some areas as more powerful chips become available for the same minimal cost.

Another common area of assembly language use is in the system [[BIOS]] of a computer.  This low-level code is used to initialize and test the system hardware prior to booting the OS and is stored in [[Read-only memory|ROM]].  Once a certain level of hardware initialization has taken place, code written in higher level languages can be used, but almost always the code running immediately after power is applied is written in assembly language.  This is usually due to the fact that system [[RAM]] may not yet be initialized at power-up and assembly language can execute without explicit use of memory, especially in the form of a [[stack (computing)|stack]].

Assembly language is also valuable in [[reverse engineering]], since many programs are distributed only in machine code form, and machine code is usually easy to translate into assembly language and carefully examine in this form, but very difficult to translate into a higher-level language. Tools such as the [[Interactive Disassembler]] make extensive use of disassembly for such a purpose.

[[MenuetOS]], a floppy-based operating system with a fully functional GUI is written entirely in assembly. A 64bit version is also available. The author claims that only through assembly language could he produce his system in less than 1.4 megabytes.&lt;!-- Lots of systems are programmed in assembler; why is MenuetOS notable? Because MenuetOS is written ENTIRELY in assembly, that's why. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Otheruses|the food or drink of the gods}}

In ancient [[Greek mythology|mythology]], '''Ambrosia''' (Greek {{lang|el|&amp;#945;&amp;#787;&amp;#956;&amp;#946;&amp;#961;&amp;#959;&amp;#963;&amp;#953;&amp;#769;&amp;#945;}}) is sometimes the food, 
sometimes the drink, of the [[gods]].  The word has generally been derived from Greek ''a-'' (&quot;not&quot;) and ''mbrotos'' (&quot;mortal&quot;); hence the food or drink of the immortals.  [[Thetis]] anointed the infant [[Achilles]] with ambrosia and passed the child through the fire to make him immortal&amp;mdash;a familiar [[Phoenicia]]n custom&amp;mdash;but [[Peleus]], appalled, stopped her. In ''[[Iliad]]'' xvi, [[Apollo]] washed the black blood from the corpse of [[Sarpedon]] and anointed it with ambrosia, readied for its dreamlike return to Sarpedon's native [[Lycia]]. The classical scholar [[Arthur Woollgar Verrall]], however, denied that there is any clear example in which the word ''ambrosios'' necessarily means ''immortal'', and preferred to explain it as &quot;fragrant,&quot; a sense which is always suitable. If so, the word may be derived from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] ''MBR'' (&quot;amber&quot;, compare &quot;[[ambergris]]&quot;) to which Eastern nations attribute miraculous properties. In Europe, honey-colored [[amber]], sometimes far from its natural source, was already a grave gift in [[Neolithic]] times and was still worn in the [[7th century CE]] as a talisman by [[Druidry|druidic]] [[Frisia|Frisians]], though St. [[Eligius]] warned &quot;No woman should presume to hang amber from her neck.&quot; [[W. H. Roscher]] thinks that both '''nectar''' and ambrosia were kinds of [[honey]], in which case their power of conferring immortality would be due to the supposed healing and cleansing power of honey, which is in fact aseptic, and because fermented honey ([[mead]]) preceded [[wine]] as an [[entheogen]] in the Aegean world: the Great Goddess of [[Crete]] on some Minoan seals had a [[bee]] face: compare [[Merope]] and [[Melissa]]. See also [[Ichor]].

One of the impieties of [[Tantalus]], according to [[Pindar]], was that he offered to his guests the ambrosia of the Deathless Ones, a theft akin to that of [[Prometheus]], [[Karl Kerenyi]] noted (in ''Heroes of the Greeks''). [[Circe]] mentioned to [[Odysseus]] that a flock of doves brought the ambrosia to Olympus. 

Derivatively, the word ''Ambrosia'' (neuter plural) was given to certain festivals in honour of [[Dionysus]], probably because of the predominance of feasting in connection with them. 

&quot;Ambrosia&quot; is related to the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[amrita]], a drink which conferred immortality on the gods.

In [[Greek mythology]], one of the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]].

Many modern scholars, including Danny Staples, relate ambrosia to the [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants | hallucinogen]]ic mushroom ''[[Amanita muscaria]].''

[[Image:AmbroseOfMilan.jpg|thumb|Saint Ambrose, mosaic in church St. Ambrogio, Milan]]
Saint '''Ambrose''', ([[Latin]]: ''Sanctus Ambrosius''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Sant'Ambrogio'') (c [[340]]&amp;ndash;[[4 April]] [[397]]), [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|bishop of Milan]], was one of the most eminent bishops of the 4th century. Together with [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Jerome]], and [[Gregory I]], he his counted one of the four [[doctors of the Church|doctors of the West]] of antique church history.

==Life==
===Worldly career===
[[Image:AmbroseStatue.png|thumb|left|Statue of St. Ambrose]]
Ambrose was a citizen of [[Rome]], born about [[337]]&amp;ndash;[[340]] in [[Trier]], [[Germany]], into a Christian family. His father was prefect of [[Gallia Narbonensis]], his mother was a woman of intellect and piety. There is a legend that as an infant, a swarm of [[bee]]s settled on his face while he lay in his cradle, leaving behind a drop of [[honey]]. His father considered this a [[Christian symbolism|sign]] of his future [[eloquence]] and honeyed-tongue. For this reason, bees and [[beehive (beekeeping)|beehives]] often appear in the [[Saint symbology|saint's symbology]].

After the early death of his father, Ambrose was destined to follow his father's career, and was accordingly educated in Rome, studying [[literature]], [[law]] and [[rhetoric]].  [[Praetor]] [[Anicius Probus]] first gave him a place in the council and then made him about 372  [[consular prefect]] of [[Liguria]] and [[Emilia]], with headquarters at [[Milan]], which was then beside Rome the second capital in Italy. Ambrose made an excellent administrator in this important position and became soon very popular.

===Bishop of Milan===
The diocese of Milan was at the time, like the rest of the church, deeply divided in the contest between Trinitarians and Arians. In [[374]], [[Auxentius]], bishop of Milan, died, and the [[Nicene]] and [[Arianism|Arian]] parties contended for the [[succession]]. The prefect went personally to the basilica where the election should take place, to prevent an uproar which was probable in this crisis. His address was interrupted by a call &quot;Ambrose for bishop!&quot; which was taken up by others upon which he was univocally elected bishop. 

Ambrose was a likely candidate in this situation, because he was known to Trinitarians as sympathizer, but also acceptable to Arians due to the theologically neutral position he took as politician. He himself refused at first energetically the office, for which he was in no way prepared - he was so far only [[catechumen]] with no theological training. Only by intervention of the emperor he gave in and got within a week baptism and ordination and was duly installed as bishop of [[Milan]]. 

As bishop, he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle, apportioned his money to the poor, settled his land on the church, making only provision for his sister [[Marcellina]], and committed the care of his family to his brother.

According to legend, Saint Ambrose immediately and forcefully stopped heresy in Milan. Actually, he moved more realistically and deliberately, as he had not many arguments against Arianism which dominated especially among the clerics and higher levels of society. He started to study the basics of theology with [[Simplician]], a [[presbyter]] of Rome. Using to advantage his excellent knowledge of Greek, which was then rare in the West, he studied the Bible and Greek authors like [[Philo]], [[Origenes]], [[Athanasius]] and [[Basil of Caesarea]], with whom he was also exchanging letters [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.ix.cxcviii.html (See letter of Basil to Ambrose)]. He applied his new knowledge as preacher, concentrating especially on exegesis of the Old Testament and his impressive rhetorical abilities impressed Augustine of Hippo, who hitherto had thought poorly of Christian preachers.

===Ambrose and Arians===
In the confrontation with Arians, Ambrose applied theological and political means, using his eloquence as effectively as his political experience and his excellent political connections.

[[Gratianus|Gratian]], the son of the elder [[Valentinian I]], was Trinitarian; but the younger [[Valentinian II|Valentinian]], who had now become his colleague in the empire, adopted the opinions of the [[Arians]], and all the arguments and eloquence of Ambrose could not reclaim the young prince to the orthodox faith. [[Theodosius I]], the emperor of the East, also professed the [[Nicene]] belief; but there were many adherents of [[Arius]] throughout his dominions, especially among the higher clergy. In this distracted state of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, [[Palladius]] and [[Secundianus]], confident of numbers, prevailed upon [[Gratian]] to call a general council from all parts of the empire. This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation; but Ambrose, foreseeing the consequence, prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops.

A [[synod]], composed of thirty-two bishops, was accordingly held at [[Aquileia]] in the year [[381]]. Ambrose was elected president; and Palladius, being called upon to defend his opinions, declined, insisting that the meeting was a partial one, and that, all the bishops of the empire not being present, the sense of the Christian church concerning the question in dispute could not be obtained.  A vote was then taken, when Palladius and his associate Secundianus were deposed from the episcopal office.

The increasing strength of the Arians proved a formidable task for Ambrose. In [[384]] the young emperor and his mother [[Justina]], along with a considerable number of [[clergy]] and [[laity]], especially military, professing the Arian faith, requested from the bishop the use of two churches, one in the city, the other in the suburbs of [[Milan]].

Ambrose refused, and was required to answer for his conduct before the council. He went, attended by a numerous crowd of people, whose impetuous zeal so overawed the ministers of Valentinian that he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches. The day following, when he was performing divine service in the basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian church in the suburbs. As he still continued obstinate, the court proceeded to violent measures: the officers of the household were commanded to prepare the [[Basilica]] and the Portian [[church]]es to celebrate divine service upon the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing [[festival]] of [[Easter]].

Perceiving the growing strength of the [[prelate]]'s interest, the court deemed it prudent to restrict its demand to the use of one of the churches. But all entreaties proved in vain, and drew forth the following characteristic declaration from the bishop: 
:&quot;If you demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to [[prison]] or to [[death]], I will not resist; but I will never betray the church of [[Jesus|Christ]]. I will not call upon the people to succour me; I will die at the foot of the [[altar]] rather than desert it. The tumult of the people I will not encourage: but [[God]] alone can appease it.&quot;

Circumstances never actually tried Ambrose's courage to this degree.

===Ambrose and emperors===
[[Image:AmbroseTheodosiusVanDyck.jpg|thumb|300px|van Dyck: Saint Ambrose and emperor Theodosius]]
If the imperial court was displeased with the religious principles and conduct of Ambrose, it respected his great political talents; and when necessity required, his aid was solicited and generously granted. When [[Magnus Maximus]] usurped the supreme power in [[Gaul]], and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent Ambrose to dissuade him from the undertaking, and the embassy was successful.

On a second attempt of the same kind Ambrose was again employed; and although he was unsuccessful, it cannot be doubted that, if his advice had been followed, the schemes of the usurper would have proved abortive; but the enemy was permitted to enter [[Italy]]; and [[Milan]] was taken. Justina and her son fled; but Ambrose remained at his post, and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief.

Ambrose was equally zealous in combating the attempt made by the upholders of the old state religion to resist the enactments of Christian emperors. The pagan party was led by [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]], consul in [[391]], who presented to [[Valentinian II]] a forcible but unsuccessful petition praying for the restoration of the [[Altar of Victory]] to its ancient station in the hall of the [[Roman Senate]], the proper support of seven [[Vestal Virgin]]s, and the regular observance of the other pagan ceremonies.

To this petition Ambrose replied in a letter to Valentinian, arguing that the devoted worshippers of [[idolatry|idols]] had often been forsaken by their [[list of deities|deities]]; that the native valour of the Roman soldiers had gained their victories, and not the pretended influence of pagan [[priest]]s; that these idolatrous worshippers requested for themselves what they refused to Christians; that voluntary was more honourable than constrained [[virginity]]; that as the Christian ministers declined to receive temporal emoluments, they should also be denied to pagan priests; that it was absurd to suppose that [[God]] would inflict a famine upon the empire for neglecting to support a religious system contrary to His will as revealed in the [[Holy Scripture]]s; that the whole process of nature encouraged innovations, and that all nations had permitted them even in religion; that heathen sacrifices were offensive to Christians; and that it was the duty of a Christian prince to suppress pagan ceremonies. In the epistles of Symmachus and of Ambrose both the petition and the reply are preserved. 

The turn of mind of Ambrose, and his rhetorical application of apparently logical processes are well displayed in his 40th and 41st ''Epistles''. A bishop was accused of instigating the burning of a synagogue by an [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] mob, and Emperor Theodosius was preparing to order the bishop to rebuild it. Ambrose discouraged the Emperor from taking this step, not that the bishop in question had never encouraged fanatic destruction, but on the grounds that it would appear to show favoritism to the [[Jew]]s. He adduces recent instances of inaction: when houses of various wealthy individuals were burned in Rome; when the house of the Bishop of [[Constantinople]] was burnt; when several Christian basilicas were burnt during the reign of [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], some of which were still not rebuilt, an action Ambrose attributes to the Jews. Ambrose asks that Christian monies not be used to build a place of worship for unbelievers, [[heretic]]s or Jews, and he reminds Theodosius that some Christian laity had said of Emperor [[Maximus]], &quot;he has become a Jew&quot; because of the edict Maximus issued regarding the burning of a Roman synagogue. Ambrose did not oppose punishing those directly responsible for burning the synagogue.

To support the logic of his argument, Ambrose halted the celebration of the [[Eucharist]], essentially holding the Christian community hostage, until Theodosius agreed to abort the investigation without requiring reparations to be made by the bishop.

[[Theodosius I]], the emperor of the East, espoused the cause of Justina, and regained the kingdom. Theodosius was threateded with excommunication by Ambrose for the massacre of 7,000 persons at [[Thessalonika|Thessalonica]] in [[390]], and was bidden imitate [[David]] in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt - Ambrose readmitted the emperor only after several months of penance to the Eucharist. This incident shows the strong position of a bishop in the Western part of the empire, even when facing a strong emperor - the controversy of [[John Chrysostom]] with a much weaker emperor a few years later in Constantinople lead to a crushing defeat of the bishop.

Ambrose's influence upon Theodosius is credited with eliciting the enactment of the &quot;Theodosian decrees&quot; of [[391]] (see entry [[Theodosius I]], which are more characteristic of the constant agenda of Ambrose than of Theodosius.

In [[392]], after the assassination of [[Valentinian II]] and the usurpation of [[Eugenius]], Ambrose fled from Milan; but when Theodosius was eventually victorious, he supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported Eugenius. Soon after acquiring the undisputed possession of the [[Roman empire]], Theodosius died at Milan in [[395]], and two years later ([[April 4]], [[397]]) Ambrose also passed away. He was succeeded as bishop of Milan by [[Simplician]]. Ambrose's body may still be viewed in the church of S. Ambrogio in Milan, where it has been continuously venerated &amp;#8212; along with the bodies identified in his time as being those of Sts. Gervase and Protase &amp;#8212; and is one of the oldest extant bodies of historical personages known outside [[Egypt]].

===Character===
Many circumstances in the history of Ambrose are characteristic of the general spirit of the times. The chief causes of his victory over his opponents were his great popularity and the reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period. But it must also be noted that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people.

He was liberal to the [[poor]]; it was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on the public characters of his times; and he introduced popular reforms in the order and manner of public worship. It is alleged, too, that at a time when the influence of Ambrose required vigorous support, he was admonished in a dream to search for, and found under the pavement of the church, the remains of two [[martyr|martyrs]], [[Gervasius]] and [[Protasius]]. The applause of the people was mingled with the derision of the court party.

==Theology==
Though ranking with [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Jerome]], and [[Gregory the Great]], as one of the [[Latin]] [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]], he is most naturally compared with [[Hilary]], whom he surpasses in administrative excellence as much as he falls below him in [[theology|theological]] ability. Even here, however, his achievements are of no mean order, especially when we remember his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of [[Biblical]] and [[doctrinal]] subjects.

His great spiritual successor, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], whose conversion was helped by Ambrose's [[sermon]]s, owes more to him than to any writer except [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]].

Ambrose's intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing [[doctrine]] of the Church and its [[sacerdotal]] ministry, while the prevalent [[asceticism]] of the day, continuing the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Cicero]]nian training of his youth, enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of Christian [[ethics]]. Thus we have the ''De officiis ministrorum'', ''De viduis'', ''De virginitate'' and ''De paenitentia''.

==Writings==
In matters of [[exegesis]] he is, like Hilary, an [[Alexandrian]]. In [[dogma]] he follows [[Basil of Caesarea]] and other Greek authors, but nevertheless gives a distinctly Western cast to the speculations of which he treats.  This is particularly manifest in the weightier emphasis which he lays upon human [[sin]] and [[divine grace]], and in the place which he assigns to [[faith]] in the individual Christian life.

==Church Music==
Catching the impulse from [[Hilary of Arles|Hilary]] and confirmed in it by the success of Arian [[psalmody]], Ambrose composed several [[hymn]]s, marked by dignified simplicity, which were not only effective in themselves but served as a fruitful model for later times. Each of these hymns has eight four-line [[stanza]]s and is written in strict iambic tetrameter.

*[http://www.geocities.com/hashanayobel/christwrit/hymns.htm Text of some Ambrosian Hymns]

St. Ambrose is considered as the first who introduced the [[Antiphon|antiphonant]] method of chanting, or one side of the choir alternately responding to the other; from whence that particular mode obtained the name of the &quot;[[chant]],&quot; while the [[plainsong]], introduced by [[Pope Gregory I|St. Gregory]], still practised in the Romish service, is called the &quot;[[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]],&quot; or &quot;[[Romish chant]].&quot; The works of St. Ambrose continue to be held in much respect, particularly the hymn of ''[[Te Deum]]'', which he is said to have composed when he baptised [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], his celebrated convert.

==Ambrose and reading==
Ambrose is the subject of a curious anecdote in [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''Confessions'' which bears on the history of [[reading (activity)|reading]]:

:''When [Ambrose] read, his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still. Anyone could approach him freely and guests were not commonly announced, so that often, when we came to visit him, we found him reading like this in silence, for he never read aloud.''

The extraordinary aspect of this passage, of course, is that Augustine felt it noteworthy that Ambrose could read silently, implying that hardly anyone else could at the time.   

[[Alvin Toffler]] also quotes this story in [[Powershift]]
:''&quot;...Saint Augustine, writing in the 5th century, refers to his mentor, Saint Ambrose, the Bishop of Milan, who was so learned that he could actually read without moving his lips. For this astonishing feat he was regarded as the brainiest person in the world.&quot;''


For more on silent reading, see ''A History of Reading'' by Albert Manguel, Chapter 2, posted on line [http://www.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Manguel/Silent_Readers.html here].

Several religious brotherhoods which have sprung up in and around Milan at various times since the [[14th century]] have been called Ambrosians. Their connection to Ambrose is tenuous.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ambracia''' (more correctly '''Ampracia''') was an ancient [[Corinth, Greece|Corinthian]] colony, situated about 7 miles from the [[Ambracian Gulf]] in [[Greece]], on a bend of the navigable river Aracthus (or Aratthus), in the midst of a fertile wooded plain.

It was founded between [[650 BC|650]] and [[625 BC]] by [[Gorgus]], son of the Corinthian tyrant [[Cypselus]].  After the expulsion of Gorgus's son [[Periander]] its government developed into a strong democracy.  The early policy of Ambracia was determined by its loyalty to Corinth (for which it probably served as an entrepot in the [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] trade), its consequent aversion to [[Corcyra]], and its frontier disputes with the Amphilochians and Acarnanians.  Hence it took a prominent part in the [[Peloponnesian War]] until the crushing defeat at [[Idomene]] ([[426 BC|426]]) crippled its resources.  

In the [[4th century BC|4th century]] it continued its traditional policy, but in [[338 BC|338]] surrendered to [[Philip II of Macedon]].  After forty-three years of autonomy under [[Macedon]]ian suzerainty it became the capital of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of Epirus, who adorned it with palace, temples and theatres.  In the wars of [[Philip V of Macedon]] and the Epirotes against the [[Aetolia]]n league ([[220 BC|220]]-[[205 BC|205]]) Ambracia passed from one alliance to the other, but ultimately joined the latter confederacy.  During the struggle of the Aetolians against [[Roman Republic|Rome]] it stood a stubborn [[siege]].  

After its capture and plunder by [[M. Fulvius Nobilior]] in [[189 BC|189]], it fell into insignificance.  The foundation by [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]] of [[Nicopolis]], into which the remaining inhabitants were drafted, left the site desolate.  In [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times a new settlement took its place under the name of Arta. Some fragmentary walls of large, well-dressed blocks near this latter town indicate the early prosperity of Ambracia.

[[image:amber.pendants.800pix.050203.jpg|thumb|250px|Amber pendants. The oval pendant is 52 by 32 mm (2 by 1.3 inches).]]
'''Amber''' is a [[fossil]] [[resin]] much used for the manufacture of ornamental objects. Although not mineralized it is sometimes considered and used as a [[gemstone]]. Most of the world's amber is in the range of 30&amp;ndash;90 million years old. Semi-fossilized resin or sub-fossil amber is called [[copal]]  
==History==

The name comes from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] &amp;#1593;&amp;#1606;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1585;, ''&amp;#699;anbar'', probably through [[Spanish language|Spanish]], but this word referred originally to [[ambergris]], which is an animal substance quite distinct from yellow amber.  True amber has sometimes been called ''kahroba'', a word of [[Persian Language|Persian]] derivation signifying &quot;that which attracts straw&quot;, in allusion to the power which amber possesses of acquiring an electric charge by friction. This property, first recorded by [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]], suggested the word &quot;[[electricity]]&quot;, from the [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[[electrum|elektron]]'', a name applied, however, not only to amber but also to an [[alloy]] of [[gold]] and [[silver]]. By [[Latin]] writers amber is variously called ''[[electrum]]'', ''sucinum'' (''succinum''), and ''glaesum'' or ''glesum''. The [[Hebrew language|Old Hebrew]] &amp;#1495;&amp;#1513;&amp;#1502;&amp;#1500; ''hashmal'' seems to have meant amber, although Modern Hebrew uses Arabic-inspired &amp;#1506;&amp;#1504;&amp;#1489;&amp;#1512; ''`inbar''. The [[German language|German]] word is ''Bernstein''.

Amber, which has no primitive uses, has been found at [[Neolithic]] sites far from its source on the shores of the [[Baltic sea]], mute witness, like [[obsidian]], to long-distance trade routes established before the [[Bronze Age]]. There is strong evidence for the theory that the Baltic coasts during the advanced civilization of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] was the source of most amber in Europe, for example the amber jewelry found in graves from [[Mycenaean Greece]] has been found to originate from the Baltic Sea. Amber was mentioned by [[Homer]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]] and others. [[Pliny the Elder]] complains that a small statue of amber costs more than a healthy slave. [[Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' talks about the [[Aesti]] people as the only ones to gather amber from the [[Baltic Sea]]. 

During the 14th century, the [[Teutonic Knights]] controlled the production of amber in Europe, forbidding its unauthorised collection from beaches on the Baltic coastline under their jurisdiction, and punishing breakers of this ordinance with death.

==Composition==

Amber is [[heterogeneous]] in composition, but consists of several [[resin]]ous bodies more or less soluble in [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[chloroform]], associated with an insoluble [[Bitumen|bituminous]] substance. Amber is a [[macromolecule]] by free [[radical polymerization]] of several precursors in the labdane family, communic acid, cummunol and biformene {{Ref|1}}. Labdanes are tetrameric [[terpene]]s (C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;) and trienes which means that the organic skeleton has three [[alkene]] groups available for [[polymerization]]. As amber matures over the years, more polymerization will take place as well as [[isomerization]] reactions, [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] and cyclization. The average composition of amber leads to the general formula [[Carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;[[Oxygen|O]]. 

Heating amber will soften it and eventually it will burn, which is why the [[German language|German]] word for amber is ''bernstein''. Heated rather below 300Â°C, amber suffers decomposition, yielding an &quot;oil of amber&quot;, and leaving a black residue which is known as &quot;amber colophony&quot;, or &quot;amber pitch&quot;; when dissolved in oil of [[turpentine]] or in [[linseed oil]] this forms &quot;amber varnish&quot; or &quot;amber lac&quot;.

True amber yields on dry distillation [[succinic acid]], the proportion varying from about 3 to 8%, and being greatest in the pale opaque or ''bony'' varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. True Baltic amber is distinguished by its
yield of succinic acid, for many of the other fossil resins which are often termed amber contain either none of it, or only a very small proportion; hence the name ''succinite'' proposed by Professor [[James Dwight Dana]], and now commonly used in scientific writings as a specific term for the real Prussian amber. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather greater than that of many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10. An effective tool for Amber analysis is [[IR spectroscopy]]. It enables the distinction between baltic amber and non-Baltic varieties because of a specific [[carbonyl]] absorption and it can also detect the relative age of an amber sample.

== Amber in Geology ==
The Baltic amber or succinite is found as irregular nodules in a marine glauconitic sand, known as ''blue earth,'' occurring in the Lower [[Oligocene]] strata of [[Sambia (Baltic)|Sambia]] in [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], where it is now systematically mined. It appears, however, to have been partly derived from yet earlier [[Tertiary]] deposits ([[Eocene]]); and it occurs also as a derivative [[mineral]] in later formations, such as the drift. Relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh, suggesting relations with the flora of Eastern [[Asia]] and the southern part of [[North America]]. [[H. R. Goppert]] named the common amber-yielding pine of the Baltic forests ''Pinites succiniter'', but as the wood, according to some authorities, does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called ''Pinius succinifera''. It is improbable, however, that the production of amber was limited to a single species; and indeed a large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber-flora.&lt;!--antique text--&gt;

==Amber inclusions ==
[[image:amber.insect.800pix.050203.jpg|thumb|250px|An insect trapped in amber. The amber piece is 10 mm (0.4 inches) long. In the enlarged picture, the insect's antennae are easily seen.]]

The resin contains, in addition to the beautifully preserved plant-structures, numerous remains of insects, spiders, annelids, crustaceans and other small organisms which became enveloped while the exudation was fluid. In most cases the organic structure has disappeared, leaving only a cavity, with perhaps a trace of [[chitin]]. Even hair and feathers have occasionally been represented among the enclosures. Fragments of wood frequently occur, with the tissues well-preserved by impregnation with the resin; while leaves, flowers and fruits are occasionally found in marvellous perfection. Sometimes the amber retains the form of drops and stalactites, just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees. The abnormal development of resin has been called ''succinosis''. Impurities are quite often present, especially when the resin dropped on to the ground, so that the material may be useless except for varnish-making, whence the impure amber is called ''firniss''. Enclosures of [[pyrites]] may give a bluish colour to amber. The so-called ''black amber'' is only a kind of [[Jet (lignite)|jet]]. ''Bony amber'' owes its cloudy opacity to minute bubbles in the interior of the resin. In the [[Dominican Republic]] exists a type of amber known as the [[Blue Amber]].

==Locations and utilization==

Although amber is found along the shores of a large part of the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[North Sea]], the great amber-producing country is the promontory of [[Samland]], now part of [[Russia]]. Pieces of amber torn from the sea-floor are cast up by the waves, and collected at ebb-tide. Sometimes the searchers wade into the sea, furnished with nets at the end of long poles, by means of which they drag in the sea-weed containing entangled masses of amber; or they dredge from boats in shallow water and rake up amber from between the boulders. Divers have been employed to collect amber from the deeper waters. Systematic dredging on a large scale was at one time carried on in the Kurisches Haff by Messrs Stantien and Becker, the great amber merchants of [[Kaliningrad|KÃ¶nigsberg]]. At the present time extensive mining operations are conducted in quest of amber. The ''pit amber'' was formerly dug in open works, but is now also worked by underground galleries. The nodules from the ''blue earth'' have to be freed from matrix and divested of their opaque crust, which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water. The sea-worn amber has lost its crust, but has often acquired a dull rough surface by rolling in sand.

Amber is extensively used for beads and other ornaments, and for cigar-holders and the mouth-pieces of pipes. It is regarded by the [[Turkey|Turks]] as specially valuable, inasmuch as it is said to be incapable of transmitting infection as the pipe passes from mouth to mouth. The variety most valued in the East is the pale straw-coloured, slightly cloudy amber. Some of the best qualities are sent to [[Vienna]] for the manufacture of smoking appliances. In working amber, it is turned on the [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]] and polished with whitening and water or with rotten stone and oil, the final lustre being given by friction with flannel. During the working much electricity is developed.

When gradually heated in an oil-bath, amber becomes soft and flexible. Two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with [[linseed oil]], heating them, and then pressing them together while hot. Cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil-bath, as the oil fills the numerous [[pore]]s to which the turbidity is due. Small fragments, formerly thrown away or used only for varnish, are now utilized on a large scale in the formation of &quot;ambroid&quot; or &quot;pressed amber&quot;. The pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure; the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. The product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewellery and articles for smoking. This pressed amber yields brilliant interference colours in polarized light. Amber has often been imitated by other resins like [[copal]] and [[kauri]], as well as by [[celluloid]] and even [[glass]]. True amber is sometimes coloured artificially.

Amber was much valued as an ornamental material in very early times.  It has been found in [[Mycenae]]an tombs; it is known from lake-dwellings in [[Switzerland]], and it occurs with [[neolithic]] remains in [[Denmark]], whilst in [[England]] it is found with interments of the [[bronze age]].  A remarkably fine cup turned in amber from a bronze-age [[tumulus|barrow]] at [[Hove]] is now in the [[Brighton Museum]]. Beads of amber occur with [[Anglo-Saxon]] relics in the south of England; and up to a comparatively recent period the material was valued as an [[amulet]]. It is still believed to possess a certain medicinal virtue. 

Rolled pieces of amber, usually small but occasionally of very large size, may be picked up on the east coast of England, having probably been washed up from deposits under the North Sea. [[Cromer]] is the best-known locality, but it occurs also on other parts of the [[Norfolk, England|Norfolk]] coast, as well as at [[Great Yarmouth]], [[Southwold]], [[Aldeburgh]] and [[Felixstowe]] in [[Suffolk]], and as far south as [[Walton-on-the-Naze]] in [[Essex, England|Essex]], whilst northwards it is not unknown in [[Yorkshire]]. On the other side of the North Sea, amber is found at various localities on the coast of the [[Netherlands]] and Denmark. On the shores of the Baltic it occurs not only on the German and Polish coast but in the south of [[Sweden]], in [[Bornholm]] and other islands, and in southern [[Finland]]. Amber has indeed a very wide distribution, extending over a large part of northern Europe and occurring as far east as the [[Urals]]. Some of the amber districts of the Baltic and North Sea were known in prehistoric times, and led to early trade with the south of Europe. Amber was carried to [[Olbia]] on the [[Black Sea]], Massilia (today [[Marseille]]) on the [[Mediterranean]], and [[Hatria]] at the head of the [[Adriatic]]; and from these centres it was distributed over the [[Hellenic]] world.

The [[Amber Room]] was a collection of chamber wall panels commissioned in [[1701]] for the king of [[Prussia]], then given to Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]. The room was hidden in place from invading [[Nazi]] forces in 1941, who upon finding it in the Cathrine Palace, disassembled it and moved it to [[Kaliningrad|KÃ¶nigsberg]].  What happened to the room beyond this point is unclear.  It is presumed lost.  It was [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3025833.stm re-created in 2003].

[[Image:amberroomdetail.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Amber Room]] was reconstructed from the [[Kaliningrad]] amber.]]

Amber and certain similar substances are found to a limited extent at several localities in the [[United States]], as in the green-sand of [[New Jersey]], but they have little or no economic value. A fluorescent amber occurs in the southern state of Chiapas in [[Mexico]], and is used extensively to create eye-catching jewellery. Blue amber is recorded in the [[Dominican Republic]].  These Central American ambers are formed from the resins of Legume trees (Hymenea) and not conifers.

==Varieties==

Besides succinite, which is the common variety of European amber, the following varieties also occur:

* Gedanite, or ''brittle amber,'' closely resembling succinite, but much more brittle, not quite so hard, with a lower melting point and containing no succinic acid. It is often covered with a white powder easily removed by wiping. The name comes from Gedanum, the Latin name of [[Gda&amp;#324;sk]] at the [[Baltic Sea]]. 
* Stantienite, a brittle, deep brownish-black resin, destitute of succinic acid.

* Beckerite, a rare amber in earthy-brown nodules, almost opaque, said to be related in properties to gutta-percha.

* Glessite, a nearly opaque brown resin, with numerous microscopic cavities and dusty enclosures, named from glesum, an old name for amber.

* Krantzite, a soft amber-like resin, found in the lignites of [[Saxony]].

* Allingite, a [[fossil]] resin allied to succinite, from Switzerland. 

* Roumanite, or Romanian amber, a dark reddish resin, occurring with lignite in Tertiary deposits. The nodules are penetrated by cracks, but the material can be worked on the lathe. [[Sulfur|Sulphur]] is present to the extent of more than 1%, whence the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen when the resin is heated. According to [[Gheorghe Murgoci]] the Romanian amber is true succinite.

* Simetite, or Sicilian amber, takes its name from the river [[Simeto]] or [[Giaretta]]. It occurs in [[Miocene]] deposits and is also found washed up by the sea near [[Catania]]. This beautiful material presents a great diversity of tints, but a rich hyacinth red is common. It is remarkable for its fluorescence, which in the opinion of some authorities adds to its beauty. Amber is also found in many localities in [[Emilia]], especially near the sulphur-mines of [[Cesena]]. It has been conjectured that the ancient [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] ornaments in amber were wrought in the Italian material, but it seems that amber from the Baltic reached the Etruscans at Hatria. It has even been supposed that amber passed from [[Sicily]] to northern Europe in early times - a supposition said to receive some support from the fact that much of the amber dug up in Denmark is red; but it must not be forgotten that reddish amber is found also on the Baltic, though not being fashionable it is used rather for varnish-making than for ornaments. Moreover, yellow amber after long burial is apt to acquire a reddish colour. The amber of Sicily seems not to have been recognized in ancient times, for it is not mentioned by local authorities like [[Diodorus Siculus]].

* Burmite is the name under which the Burmese amber is now described. Until the British occupation of [[Burma]] but little was known as to its occurrence, though it had been worked for centuries and was highly valued by the natives and by the Chinese. It is found in fiat rolled pieces, irregularly distributed through a blue clay probably of Miocene age. It occurs in the [[Hukawng]] valley, in the [[Nangotaimaw]] hills, where it is irregularly worked in shallow pits. The mines were visited some years ago by Dr [[Fritz Noetling]], and the mineral has been described by Dr [[Otto Helm]]. The Burmese amber is yellow or reddish, some being of ruby tint, and like the Sicilian amber it is fluorescent. Burmite and simetite agree also in being destitute of succinic acid.  Most of the Burmese amber is worked at [[Mandalay]] into rosary-beads and ear-cylinders.

Many other fossil resins more or less allied to amber have been described.  Schraufite is a reddish resin from the [[Carpathian]] [[sandstone]], and it occurs with [[Jet (lignite)||jet]] in the [[Cretaceous]] rocks of the [[Lebanon]]; ambrite is a resin found in many of the [[coal]]s of [[New Zealand]]; retinite occurs in the lignite of [[Bovey Tracey]] in Devonshire and elsewhere; whilst copaline has been found in the London clay of [[Highgate]] in North London. Chemawinite or cedarite is an amber-like resin from the [[Saskatchewan river]] in [[Canada]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amalaric''' or ''Amalarico'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (died [[531]]), king of the [[Visigoths]], son of [[Alaric II]], was a child when his father fell in battle against [[Clovis I]], king of the [[Franks]], in ([[507]]). [[Gesalec]] was chosen king and the child Amalaric was carried for safety into [[Hispania]], which country and [[Provence]] were thenceforth ruled by his maternal grandfather, [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] the Ostrogoth, acting through his vice regent, [[Theudis]], an Ostrogothic nobleman. In [[522]] the young Amalaric was proclaimed king, and four years later, on Theodoric's death, he assumed full royal power in Hispania and that part of [[Languedoc]] called [[Septimania]], relinquishing [[Provence]] to his cousin [[Athalaric]]. He married [[Chrotilda]], daughter of Clovis; but his disputes with her, he being an [[Arianism|Arian]] and she a [[Catholicism|Catholic]], brought on him the penalty of a Frankish invasion by [[Childebert I]], king of [[Paris]], in which he lost his life in [[531]].

[[Konami]] has twice included flying, angelic [[Archery|archers]] enemies in its [[Castlevania]] series of games, tying them to the story of Amalaric's demise.  In [[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]], there is a blue-tinted angelic enemy known as &quot;Sniper of Goth,&quot; whose description reads &quot;Slew Amalaric of the Goths.&quot;  In [[Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow]], the enemy appears again and is functionally identical, although its name is now &quot;Amalaric Sniper&quot; and its description now reads &quot;A fearsome archer and a fallen angel.&quot;

'''Alpenhorn''' or '''alphorn''', a [[wind instrument]], consisting of a natural wooden horn of conical bore, having a cup-shaped [[mouthpiece]], used by mountain dwellers in Switzerland and elsewhere. 

The alphorn is carved from solid softwood, generally spruce but sometimes pine. In former times the alphorn maker would find a tree bent at the base in the shape of an alphorn, but modern makers piece the wood together at the base.   A cup-shaped mouthpiece carved out of a block of hard wood is added and the instrument is complete.  

The alpenhorn has no lateral openings and therefore gives the pure natural harmonic series of the open pipe.  The harmonics are the more readily obtained by reason of the small diameter of the bore in relation to the length.  An alpenhorn made at Rigi-Kulm, Schwyz, and now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], measures 8 ft. in length and has a straight tube.

The well-known Ranz des Vaches is the traditional melody of the alpenhorn from French Switzerland. The song describes the time of bringing the cows to the high country at cheese making time. [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]] introduced the melody into his opera ''William Tell.'' [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] was clear that the inspiration for the great melody that opens the last movement of his First Symphony (played in the orchestra by the [[horn (instrument)|horn]]) was an alphorn melody he heard in the Rigi area of Switzerland.

The Swiss alpenhorn varies in shape according to the locality, being curved near the bell in the Bernese Oberland.  [[Michael Praetorius]] mentions the alpenhorn under the name of holzerni trummet in ''Syntagma Musicum'' (Wittenberg, 1615-1619). 

This is the horn featured in [[Ricola]] [[cough medicine|cough drop]] commercials.

The '''Alpaca''' (Vicugna pacos) is one of two domesticated breeds of South American [[camel]]-like [[ungulate|ungulates]], derived from the wild [[guanaco]].  It resembles a sheep in appearance, but is larger in size, and has a long erect neck with a handsome head.

Alpacas are kept in large flocks that graze on the level heights of the [[Andes]] of southern [[Peru]], northern [[Bolivia]], and northern [[Chile]] at an altitude of between 3500 and 5000 meters above sea-level, throughout the year.  They are not used as beasts of burden like [[llama|llamas]], but are valued only for their [[fiber]], of which Indian blankets and ponchos are 
made.  The alpaca comes in 22 natural colours. In stature, the alpaca is considerably inferior to the llama, but has the same unpleasant habit of spitting. 

In the textile industry, &quot;alpaca&quot; is a name given to two distinct things.  It is primarily a term applied to the wool, or rather hair, obtained from the Peruvian alpaca.  It is, however, more broadly applied to a style of fabric originally made from alpaca fiber but now frequently made from a similar type of fiber, such as [[mohair]], [[Icelandic (sheep)|Icelandic sheep]] wool, or even some high-quality English wool.  In trade, distinctions are made between alpacas and the several styles of mohairs and lustres. However, as far as the general purchaser is concerned, little or no distinction is made.

===Background===
Alpacas have been domesticated for thousands of years, and originate from Peru, Chile and Bolivia.  There are no wild alpacas; it is believed that they are descended from the [[vicuna]], which is also native to South America.  They are closely related to llamas, which are descended from the guanaco.  These four species of animals are collectively called camelids.

Of the four, the alpaca and the vicuÃ±a are the most valuable wool-bearing animals: the alpaca because of the quality and quantity of its wool, and the vicuÃ±a because of the softness, fineness and quality of its coat.

Alpacas and llamas can (and do) successfully cross breed, the resulting offspring are called huarizo.  

There are two types of alpaca â huacaya (with crimpy sheep-like âwoolâ) and suri (with silky dreadlocks).  Suris are much rarer than huacaya, estimated to make up between 6 and 10% of the alpaca population.  The suri is probably rarer because it is less hardy in the harsh South American mountain climates, as the style of its fleece offers less insulation against the cold (the suri fleece parts along the spine, exposing the animal to the cold unlike the huacaya fleece which provides excellent cover over the backbone).

Alpaca fleece is a luxurious fibre, similar to sheepâs wool in some respects, although it is lighter in weight, silkier to the touch, warmer and not as prickly. A big trade of alpace fleece exists in the countries where alpacas live, from very simple and not so expensive garments made by the aboriginal communities, to sophisticated products industrially made, that can have significantly high prices. 

White is the predominant colour of alpacas, both suri and huacaya.  This is because selective breeding has favoured white â bulk white fleece is easier to market and can be dyed any colour.  However, alpacas come in 22 natural colours, from a true blue black through browns and fawns to white, and there are silver greys and rose greys as well.

Traditionally, alpaca meat has been eaten fresh, fried or in stews, by Andean inhabitants. There is a resurgent interest in alpaca meat in countries like Peru, where it is relatively easy to find it at upscale restaurants. 

===Behaviour===
Alpacas are social herd animals and should always be kept with others of their kind.  They are gentle and elegant, inquisitive and observant.  As they are a prey animal, rather than a predator, they are cautious and will understandably be nervous if they feel threatened. They like their own space and donât appreciate another alpaca (or human) getting too close, especially from behind.  They will warn the intruder away by threatening to spit, or by spitting, or by kicking.  Some alpacas kick, some donât â but yes, they all spit.

Spitting is reserved for other alpacas, not for humans, but sometimes the human can get in the line of fire, or the alpaca aims badly and misses the intended target.  The spit is not pleasant: it is the contents of the stomach â green (regurgitated grass) â and smells foul.  

Alpacas donât like their heads being touched.  Once they know their owners, and feel confident around them, they will probably allow their backs and necks to be touched, but they wonât appreciate being grabbed, especially by boisterous children.  If an owner need to catch an alpaca, the neck offers a good handle â and holding the neck firmly between the arms is the best way to restrain the animal.

To help alpacas control their internal parasites they have a communal dung pile, which they do not graze.  Generally, males have much tidier dung piles than females who tend to stand in a line and all go at once!

Sheep baa, cows moo and alpacas hum.  Different animals have different voices, but basically it is a &quot;mmm&quot; sound.  However, they make other sounds as well as humming. When danger is present they sound the alarm call, a high pitched shriek, for instance. Some breeds are known to make a sound similar to a &quot;Wark&quot; noise when excited, and they stand proud with their tails sticking out and their ears in a very alert position.  Strange dogs â and even cats â can trigger this reaction.  (They recognise domestic cats for what they are â a relation of the puma, a natural predator of the alpaca in South America.)  

When males fight they also scream, a warbling bird-like cry, presumably intended to terrify the other combatant.  Fighting is to determine dominance, and therefore the right to mate the females in the herd, and it is triggered by testosterone.  This is why males are often kept in separate paddocks â when two dominant males get together war breaks out!

A male in the act of mating, or hoping for a chance to mate, will âorgle.â  This orgling will help to put the female in the mood, and it is believed that it also helps her to ovulate after the act of mating â very necessary for a pregnancy to take place!

Pregnancies last eleven and a half months and the young are called crias.   Soon after the cria is born the female will be ready to mate again, babies are therefore an annual event.  A female is usually ready to mate for the first time at a year of age, but a male can often not work until he is two or even three years old.

Alpacas generally live for more than 20 years â we think!  Conditions and nutrition are better in the USA, Australia, New Zealand and Europe than in South America, so animals live longer and are healthier.  One of the oldest alpacas in New Zealand (fondly known as Vomiting Violet) died at the end of 2005 at the ripe old age of 29.

== History of the scientific name ==
In [[1758]] the four South American camelid species were assigned scientific names. At that time, the alpaca was assumed to be descended from the [[Lama glama|llama]], ignoring similarities in size, fleece and dentition between the alpaca and the [[Vicugna vicugna|vicu&amp;ntilde;a]]. Classification was complicated by the fact that all four species of South American camelid can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. It was not until the advent of DNA technology that a more accurate classification was possible.

Miss Great Aunt Edds started the first out of continent farm. She established the first Canadian Alpaca farm outside of Kingston Ontario. Originally started with only 4 alpacas, the farm grew to no less than 24 alpacas by 2005. The alpacas, originally raised for their fleece, now also serve the local restaurant industry, providing them with delicious alpaca steaks.

In 2001 the alpaca genus classification changed from &lt;i&gt;Lama pacos&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Vicugna pacos&lt;/i&gt; following the presentation of a paper [http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=bf588d8be995486f872cd4a9008b9f35&amp;referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,12,18;journal,94,201;linkingpublicationresults,1:102024,1 Genetic analysis reveals the wild ancestors of the llama and the alpaca] on work by [[Dr Jane Wheeler]] et al on alpaca DNA to the [[Royal Society]] showing that the alpaca is descended from the vicuÃ±a, not the guanaco.

The relationship between alpacas and vicuÃ±as was disputed for many years, but Wheeler's DNA work proved it. However many academic sites have not caught up with this, so it is something well known to alpaca breeders who have read Dr Hoffman's book, and to Royal Society members who have access to the current classification data, but not more widely known.

== Fiber ==
[[image:Alpaca_cuzco_peru.jpg|thumb|left|Alpaca]]
Alpaca fiber is warmer than sheeps' wool and lighter in weight.  It is soft and luxurious and lacks the &quot;prickle&quot; factor.  However, as with all fleece producing animals, quality varies from animal to animal, and some alpaca produce fibre which is less than ideal.

Alpaca have been bred in South America for hundreds of years (mainly Peru, but also Chile and Bolivia), but in recent years have been exported to other countries.  In countries such as the USA, Australia and New Zealand breeders shear their animals annually, weigh the fleeces and test them for fineness.  With the resulting knowledge they are able to breed heavier fleeced animals with finer fibre.  Fleece weights vary, with the top stud males reaching annual shear weights up to 6kg.

Two types of fleece are produced: huacaya and suri.  It has been proposed that in fact these are two different breeds of animal, and that camelids come in five types - guanaco, vicuna, llama, huacaya (alpaca) and suri.  This view is not commonly accepted however.  

In physical structure, alpaca is somewhat akin to (human?) hair, being very glossy, but its softness and fineness enable the [[spinning|spinner]] to produce satisfactory [[yarn]] with comparative ease.

==Alpaca fiber industry==

=== History ===
The history of the manufacture of this fiber into cloth is one of the romances of commerce.  The Indians of [[Peru]] used this fibre in the manufacture of many styles of fabrics for centuries before its introduction into Europe as a commercial product.  The first European importations were into [[Spain]].  [[Spain]] transferred the fibre to [[Germany]] and [[France]].  Apparently alpaca yarn was spun in [[England]] for the first time about the year [[1808]].  It does not appear to have made any headway, however, and alpaca fiber was condemned as an unworkable material.  In [[1830]] Benjamin Outram, of Greetland, near Halifax, appears to have reattempted the spinning of this fibre, and, for the second time, alpaca was condemned.  These two attempts to use alpaca were failures owing to the style of fabric into which the yarn was woven &amp;mdash; a species of [[camlet]].  It was not until the introduction of cotton warps into the [[Bradford, England|Bradford]] trade about [[1836]] that the true qualities of alpaca could be developed in the fabric.  Where the [[cotton warp]] and [[mohair]] or alpaca weft plain-cloth came from is not known, but it was this simple yet ingenious structure which enabled [[Titus Salt]], then a young Bradford manufacturer, to use alpaca successfully.  Bradford is still the great spinning and manufacturing centre for alpaca, large quantities of yarns and cloths being exported annually to the continent and to the [[United States]], although the quantities naturally vary in accordance with the fashions in vogue, the typical &quot;alpaca-fabric&quot; being a very characteristic &quot;[[dress-fabric]].&quot; 

[[Image:Alpaca_MidSomerset_210805.jpg|thumb|200px|right| Alpacas on show in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]]]

Owing to the success in the manufacture of the various styles of alpaca cloths attained by Sir Titus Salt and other Bradford manufacturers, a great demand for alpaca wool arose, and this demand could not be met by the native product, for there seems to never have been any appreciable increase in the number of alpacas available.  Unsuccessful attempts were made to acclimatize the alpaca in England, on the European continent and in Australia, and even to cross certain English breeds of [[domestic sheep|sheep]] with the alpaca.  There is, however, a cross between the alpaca and the llama &amp;mdash; a true [[hybrid]] in every sense &amp;mdash; producing a material placed upon the Liverpool market under the name &quot;Huarizo&quot;. Crosses between the alpaca and vicuÃ±a have not proved satisfactory.  Current attempts to cross these two breeds are underway at farms in the United States. According to the Alpaca Owners and Breeders Association, alpacas are now being bred in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, and numerous other places.

The preparing, combing, spinning, weaving and finishing process of alpaca and mohair are similar to that of [[wool]].

Farmers commonly quote the alpaca with the phrase 'love is in the fleece', which describes their love for the animal.

=== Prices ===
The price for alpacas can range from $200 to $360,000, depending on breeding history, sex, and color. One can raise up to 10 alpacas on one [[acre]] (4,047 m&amp;sup2;) as they have a designated area for waste products and keep their eating area away from their waste area to avoid diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Army''' (from [[French language|French]] ''armÃ©e'') can, in some countries, refer to any [[armed force]]. More commonly, however, it is only used specifically to refer to a land force of the [[military]].

Within a national army, an '''army''' can also refer to a large [[formation (military)|formation]], usually comprising one or more [[corps]].

'''Army''' is also often used in the description or title of military or [[paramilitary]] organisations which are not part of a country's official armed forces (and may well be illegal), such as the [[Irish Republican Army]], and also in some non-military organisations organised on a quasi-military basis, such as the [[Salvation Army]] and the [[Church Army]].

==Field Army==

A Field Army is composed of a headquarters, army troops, a variable number of corps, and a variable number of divisions. A battle is influenced at the Field Army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point.

== National land forces ==

A national army is usually the arm of the military service which conducts land-based warfare (for example, the [[United States Army]], or the [[France|French]] [[ArmÃ©e de Terre]]). 

Most armed forces make considerable distinction between the army or land forces, the [[navy]], and the [[air force]], often maintaining three independent organizations.  Many air forces were formerly part of an army; historically, the [[United States Air Force]] originated as part of the [[United States Army]], for example.

Modern armies comprise several branches (also called ''services'', or ''[[administrative corps]]'').  These may include the [[combat]] branches: [[infantry]], [[armoured]], [[artillery]], and [[combat engineers]], as well as the [[support]] branches: [[Military communications |communications]], [[Military intelligence |intelligence]], [[Combat medic |medics]], [[Military logistics |supply]], and [[army aviation]] (as opposed to a national air force).

== Formations ==

An '''army''' can also be a large [[military organization]] ([[formation (military) |formation]]) comprising one or more [[corps]]. A particular army is named or numbered to distinguish it from military land forces in general&amp;mdash;for example, the [[U.S. First Army]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]].  In the [[British Army]] it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army (e.g. First Army), whereas lower formations use figures (e.g. 1st Division). 

Armies (as well as [[army group]]s and [[Theater (military)|theater]]s) are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size, composition, and scope of responsibility.

In the [[Soviet Union |Soviet]] [[Red Army]], &quot;armies&quot; were actually [[corps]]-sized formations, subordinate to an army-sized &quot;[[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]&quot; in wartime.  In peacetime, a [[Army (Soviet Army)|Soviet army]] was usually subordinate to a [[military district]].

For the hierarchy of land force organizations, see [[military organization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Applied mathematics''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] that concerns itself with the application of mathematical knowledge to other domains. Such applications include [[numerical analysis]], [[mathematical physics]], mathematics of [[engineering]], [[linear programming]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[operations research]], [[continuous modelling]], [[control theory]], [[mathematical biology]] and [[bioinformatics]], [[information theory]], [[game theory]], [[probability]] and [[statistics]], [[mathematical economics]], [[financial mathematics]], [[actuarial science]], [[cryptography]] and hence [[combinatorics]] and even [[finite geometry]] to some extent, [[graph theory]] as applied to [[network theory|network analysis]], and a great deal of what is called [[computer science]]. 

The question of what is applied mathematics does not answer to logical classification so much as to the sociology of professionals who use mathematics. The mathematical methods are usually applied to the specific problem field by means of a [[mathematical model]] of the system.

Engineering mathematics describes physical processes, and so is often indistinguishable from [[theoretical physics]]. Important subdivisions include: [[fluid dynamics]], [[acoustic theory]], [[Maxwell's equations]] that govern [[electromagnetism]], [[mechanics]], [[numerical relativity]], etc.

Fundamental applied mathematics is taught at second-level in some countries, such as [[Ireland]], where it is a minority option at [[Leaving Certificate]].

'''Alligators''' and '''caimans''' are [[reptile]]s closely related to the [[crocodile]]s and forming the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Alligatoridae''' (sometimes regarded instead as the [[subfamily]] '''Alligatorinae'''). Together with the [[Gharial]] (family Gavialidae) they make up the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Crocodilia]].

[[Alligator]]s differ from crocodiles principally in having wider and shorter heads, with more obtuse snouts; in having the fourth, enlarged tooth of the under jaw received, not into an external notch, but into a pit formed for it within the upper one; in lacking a jagged fringe which appears on the hind legs and feet of the crocodile; and in having the toes of the hind feet webbed not more than half way to the tips. In general, the more dangerous crocodilians to human beings tend to be [crocodiles rather than alligators.

Alligators proper occur in the fluvial deposits of the age of the [[Cretaceous|Upper Chalk]] in Europe, where they did not die out until the [[Pliocene]] age.

The true alligators are now restricted to two species, ''[[American Alligator|A. mississippiensis]]'' in the [[Southern United States]], which grows up to 4 m (12 ft) in length, and the small ''[[Chinese Alligator|A. sinensis]]'' in the [[Yangtze River]], [[People's Republic of China]].  Their name derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''el lagarto'', &quot;the lizard&quot;).

In [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] alligators are represented by five species of the [[genus]] ''[[Caiman]]'', which differs from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils, and the ventral armour is composed of overlapping bony scutes, each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture. Some authorities further divide this genus into three, splitting off the smooth-fronted caimans into a genus ''Paleosuchus'' and the Black Caiman into ''Melanosuchus''.     

''C. crocodilus'', the Spectacled Caiman, has the widest distribution, from southern Mexico to the northern half of Argentina, and grows to a modest size of about 7 feet. The largest, attaining an enormous bulk and a length of 20 ft., is the near-extinct ''Melanosuchus niger'', the Jacare-assu, Large, or Black Caiman of the Amazon. The [[Black Caiman]] is the only member of the alligator family posing the same danger to humans as the larger species of the [[crocodile]] family.  

Although the Caiman has not been studied in-depth, it has been discovered that their mating cycles (previously thought to be spontaneous or year-round) are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels in order to increase their offspring's chances of survival.

Some crocodiles can be found in salty water, but most alligators stay in fresh water.

==Cultural aspects==

In [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[African American]] [[folklore]], the alligator is revered, especially the teeth, which can be worn as a charm against [[witchcraft]] and [[poison]].

Often, it is the butt of practical jokes by [[trickster]]s like [[Brer Rabbit]].

An [[urban legend]] states that people buy baby alligators after visiting [[Florida]] or other places where they are native and flush them down the toilet once they get big.  The story goes that full grown alligators exist in the sewers of cities like [[New York City]].  This is impossible, however, because without UV rays from sunlight, alligators cannot properly metabolize calcium, resulting in metabolic bone disease and eventually death. Small released alligators and caimans, though, are occasionally found in northern lakes.  

Alligator skin was once a highly prized [[leather]], and was farmed in some areas, as pictured in the panoramic image below.  Alligator is sometimes eaten as an exotic meat.

The '''Aleutian Islands''' (possibly from [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] ''aliat'', &quot;[[island]]&quot;) are a chain of more than 300 small volcanic islands forming an [[island arc]] situated in the Northern [[Pacific Ocean]], occupying an area of 6,821 sq mi (17,666 sq km) and extending about 1,200 mi (1,900 km) westward from the [[Alaska Peninsula]] toward the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. Crossing longitude 180Â°, they are the westernmost part of the [[United States]] (and technically also the easternmost; ''see [[Extreme points of the United States]]''). Nearly all of the [[archipelago]] is part of [[Alaska]] and usually considered as being in the &quot;[[Alaskan Bush]]&quot;, but the extreme western end is in [[Russia]]. The islands with their 57 volcanoes are located in the northern part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Aleutians-space.jpg|thumb|250px|Aleutians seen from space]]
The islands, known before 1867 as the Catherine Archipelago, comprise four groups&amp;mdash; the [[Fox Islands|Fox]], [[Andreanof Islands|Andreanof]], [[Rat Islands|Rat]] and [[Near Islands]]. They are all located between 52 degrees and 55 degrees North latitude and 172 degrees East and 163 degrees West longitude.

The axis of the archipelago near the mainland of Alaska has a southwest trend, but near the 129th meridian its direction changes to the northwest. This change of direction corresponds to a curve in the line of [[volcanic]] fissures which have contributed their products to the building of the islands. Such curved chains are repeated about the Pacific Ocean in the [[Kuril Islands]], the [[Japan|Japanese]] chain and in the [[Philippines]]. All these island arcs are at the edge of the [[Pacific Plate]] and experience lots of [[seismic]] activity, but are still habitable; the Aleutians lie between the Pacific and North American [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. The general elevation is greatest in the eastern islands and least in the western. The island chain is really a western continuation of the [[Aleutian Range]] on the mainland. 

[[Image:North-Pacific-air-routes.png|thumb|250px|left|Active Aleutian volcanoes]]
The great majority of the islands bear evident marks of volcanic origin, and there are numerous volcanic cones on the north side of the chain, some of them active; many of the islands, however, are not wholly volcanic, but contain  crystalline or sedimentary rocks, and also amber and beds of [[lignite]]. The coasts are rocky and surf-worn, and the approaches are exceedingly dangerous, the land rising immediately from the coasts to steep, bold mountains.

The volcano [[Makushin]] (5691 ft/1,735 m) is visible from [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]], and the volcanic [[islet]]s [[Bogoslof]] and [[Grewingk]], which rose from the sea in 1796 and 1883 respectively, lie about 30 miles (48 km) west of the bay.

&lt;br clear=both&gt;

==Climate==
[[Image:AleutianIslands.jpg|thumb|310px|Aleutian Islands]]
The climate of the islands is oceanic, with moderate and fairly uniform temperatures and heavy rainfall. Fogs are almost constant. The summers are much cooler than on the mainland at [[Sitka]], but the winter temperature of the islands and of the [[Alaska Panhandle]] is very nearly the same. The mean annual temperature for [[Unalaska]], the most populated island of the group, is about 38 degrees Fahrenheit (3.4 degrees Celsius), being about 30 Â°F (&amp;minus;1.1 Â°C) for January and about 52 Â°F (11.1 Â°C) for August. The highest and lowest temperatures recorded on the islands are 78 Â°F (26 Â°C) and 5 Â°F (&amp;minus;15 Â°C), respectively. The average annual amount of rainfall is about 80 in (2,030 mm), and Unalaska, with about 250 rainy days per year, is said to be the rainiest place within the territory of the [[United States]].

==Economy==
The growing season lasts about 135 days, from early in May till late in September, but agriculture is limited to the raising of a few vegetables. With the exception of some stunted [[willow]]s, the islands are practically destitute of trees, but are covered with a luxuriant growth of herbage, including [[Poaceae|grass]]es, [[sedge]]s and many flowering plants. On the less mountainous islands, the raising of [[domestic sheep|sheep]] and [[reindeer]] was believed to be practicable.  

People living in the Aleutian Islands developed fine skills in hunting and basketry. Hunters made their weapons and watercraft. The baskets are noted for being finely woven with carefully shredded stalks of [[beach rye]].

==Demographics==
The people refer to themselves as Unangan, and have been called &quot;[[Aleut]]&quot;. 

The [[Aleut language]] is one of the two main branches of the [[Eskimo-Aleut_languages|Eskimo-Aleut]] language family. This family is not known to be related to any others.

In the [[2000]] [[census]], there was a population of 8,162 on the islands, of which 4,283 were living in the main settlement of [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]].

==History==
Because of the location of the islands, stretching like a broken bridge from Asia to America, many anthropologists believe they were a route of the first human occupants of the Americas. The earliest known evidence of human occupation in the Americas is much further south, in [[New Mexico]] and [[Peru]]; the early human sites in Alaska have probably been submerged by rising waters during the current [[interglacial]] period.

Explorers, traders, colonists, and missionaries arrived from [[Russia]] beginning in [[1741]]. 

In 1741 the Russian government sent out [[Vitus Bering]], a [[Denmark|Dane]] in the service of Russia, and [[Alexei Ilyich Chirikov|Alexei Chirikov]], a Russian, in the ships ''[[Saint Peter (ship)|Saint Peter]]'' (''Swiatoj Pietr'') and ''[[Saint Paul (ship)|Saint Paul]]'' on a voyage of discovery in the Northern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. After the ships were separated by a storm, Chirikov discovered several eastern islands of the Aleutian group, and Bering discovered several of the western islands, finally being wrecked and losing his life on the island of the [[Komandorski Islands]] (Commander Islands) that now bears his name ([[Bering Island]]). The survivors of Bering's party reached the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in a boat constructed from the wreckage of their ship, and reported that the islands were rich in fur-bearing animals.

Siberian fur hunters flocked to the Commander Islands and gradually moved eastward across the Aleutian Islands to the mainland. In this manner [[Russia]] gained a foothold on the northwestern coast of North America. The Aleutian Islands consequently belonged to Russia, until that country [[Alaska Purchase|transferred]] all its possessions in North America to the United States in [[1867]]. 

The Russians were ruthless in their expansion, using technology and cruelty to demand tribute and labor from the Aleuts, especially for [[sea otter]] hunting. The Russians captured otter pelts from the Aleutian Islands, through the [[Gulf of Alaska]], along the Alaska Panhandle, and south, even to [[California]]. Some Aleuts were moved to the [[Pribilof Islands]] so that fur seals could be captured there as well.

By [[1760]], the Russian merchant [[Adriian Tolstykh]] had made a detailed census in the vicinity of [[Adak]] and extended Russian citizenship to the Aleuts.

Despite some attempts to eliminate slavery and reduce cruel treatment in the [[1790s]], the [[Shelikov company]] depended on the labor of Aleut hunters to collect sea otter pelts.

During his third and last voyage, in [[1778]], Captain [[James Cook]] surveyed the eastern portion of the Aleutian archipelago, accurately determined the position of some of the more important islands and corrected many errors of former navigators. 

One of the first [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries to arrive in the Aleutian Islands was a monk named Herman, who arrived in [[1793]] with nine other [[Russian Orthodox]] monks and priests. Within two years, he was the only survivor of that party. He settled on [[Spruce Island]], near [[Kodiak Island]], and often defended the rights of the Aleuts against the Russian trading companies. He is now known in the Orthodox Church as St. [[Herman of Alaska]].

Another early Christian missionary of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was Father Veniaminov who arrived in Unalaska in [[1824]]. He was named Bishop Innokentii in 1840 and moved to [[Sitka]]. He is now known in the Orthodox Church as [[Saint Innocent of Alaska]].

In [[1906]] a new volcanic cone rose between the islets of Bogoslof and Grewingk, near Unalaska, followed by another in [[1907]]. These cones were nearly demolished by an explosive eruption on [[1 September]] [[1907]].  

The principal settlements were on Unalaska Island. The oldest was Iliuliuk (also called Unalaska), settled in 1760-1775, with a customs house, an [[Orthodox]] church, and a [[Methodist]] mission and orphanage, and the headquarters for a considerable fleet of United States [[revenue cutter]]s which  patrol the [[sealing]] grounds of the [[Pribilof Islands]]. The first public school in Unalaska opened in 1883. Adjacent is [[Dutch Harbor]] (so named, it is said, because a Dutch vessel was the first to enter it), which is an important port for [[Bering Sea]] commerce.  

The [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] extended American citizenship to all Indians (and this law has been held to include the indigenous peoples of Alaska) in [[1924]].

A hospital was built in Unalaska in [[1933]] by the US [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. 

During [[World War II]], small parts of the Aleutian islands were occupied by [[Japan]]ese forces when [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]] were invaded in order to divert American forces away from the main Japanese attack at [[Midway Atoll]]. The U.S. Navy, having broken the Japanese naval radio codes, knew that this was just a diversion, and it did not expend large amounts of effort in defending the islands. A few Americans were taken to Japan as prisoners of war. Most of the civilian population of the Aleutians were interned by the United States in camps in the [[Alaska Panhandle]]. American forces invaded Japanese-held Attu, defeated the Japanese there, and subsequently regained control of all the islands. See: [[Battle of the Aleutian Islands]].

Monday, [[June 3]], [[2002]] was celebrated as [[Dutch Harbor Remembrance Day]]. The governor of Alaska ordered state flags lowered to half-staff to honor the 78 soldiers who died during the two-day Japanese air attack in 1942. The [[Aleutians World War II Campaign National Historic Area]] Visitors Center opened in June 2002.

The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act ([[ANCSA]]) became law in [[1971]]. In 1977, the [[Ounalashka Corporation]] (from Unalaska) declared a [[dividend]]. This was the first village corporation to declare and pay a dividend to its shareholders.

==Miscellaneous==

The Aleutian Islands would likely be an important part of the [[National Missile Defense]] system proposed to defend the United States from small ballistic missile attacks.

'''Alderfly''' is the name given to [[Neuroptera|neuropterous]] [[insect]]s of the family [[Sialidae]], related to the ant-lions, with long filamentous antennae and four large wings, of which the [[anterior]] pair is rather longer than the posterior. 

The females lay a vast number of eggs upon grass stems near water.  The larvae are aquatic, active, armed with strong sharp mandibles, and breathe by means of seven pairs of abdominal branchial filaments.  When full sized they leave the water and spend a quiescent [[pupa]]l stage on the land before [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] into the sexually mature insect. 

''Sialis lutaria'' is a well-known British example.  In America they are called Fishflies and there are two genera, ''Sialis'' and ''Chauliodes.''

'''Alder''' is the common name of a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s ('''''Alnus''''') belonging to the birch family (Family [[Betulaceae]]). The genus comprises about 30 [[species]] of [[Plant sexuality|monoecious]] [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s, few reaching large size, distributed throughout the North Temperate zone, and in the [[New World]] also along the [[Andes]] southwards to [[Chile]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[deciduous]] ([[evergreen]] or nearly so in a few species), alternate, simple, and serrated. The [[flower]]s are [[catkin]]s with elongate male catkins on the same plant as shorter female catkins, often before leaves appear; they are mainly wind-pollinated, but also visited by [[bee]]s to a small extent. They differ from the [[birch]]es (''Betula'', the other genus in the family) in that the female catkins are woody and do not disintegrate at maturity, opening to release the seeds in a similar manner to many [[Conifer cone|conifer cones]].

The best-known species is the Common or [[Black Alder]] (''A. glutinosa''), native to most of [[Europe]] and widely introduced elsewhere. The largest species is [[Red Alder]] (''A. rubra''), reaching 35 m (the tallest is 32 m) on the west coast of [[North America]], with Black Alder and [[Italian Alder]] (''A. cordata'') both reaching about 30 m. By contrast, the widespread [[Green Alder]] (''A. viridis'') is rarely more than a 5 m shrub.

The common name ''alder'' is derived from an old [[Germanic_language|Germanic]] root. The botanic name ''Alnus'' is the original [[Latin]] name. 

==Classification==
The genus is divided into three subgenera:

'''Subgenus ''Alnus''.''' Trees. Shoot buds stalked. Male and female catkins produced in autumn (fall) but staying closed over winter, pollinating in late winter or early spring. About 15-25 species, including:
*''A. acuminata'' - [[Andean Alder]]. Andes Mountains, South America.
*''A. cordata'' - [[Italian Alder]]. Italy.
*''Alnus formosana'' -[[Formosan Alder]]
*''A. glutinosa'' - [[Black Alder]]. Europe.
*''A. incana'' - [[Grey Alder]]. Europe &amp; Asia.
**''A. oblongifolia'' (''A. incana'' subsp. ''oblongifolia'') - [[Grey Alder|Arizona Alder]]. Southwestern North America.
**''A. rugosa'' (''A. incana'' subsp. ''rugosa'') - [[Grey Alder|Speckled Alder]]. Northeastern North America.
**''A. tenuifolia'' (''A. incana'' subsp. ''tenuifolia'') - [[Grey Alder|Thinleaf Alder]] or Mountain Alder. Northwestern North America.
*''A. japonica'' - [[Japanese Alder]]. Japan.
*''A. jorullensis'' - [[Mexican Alder]]. Mexico, Guatemala.
*''A. orientalis'' - [[Oriental Alder]]. Southern Turkey, northwest Syria, Cyprus.
*''A. rhombifolia'' - [[White Alder]]. Interior western North America.
*''A. rubra'' - [[Red Alder]]. West coastal North America.
*''A. serrulata'' - Hazel alder, [[Tag Alder]] or Smooth alder. Eastern North America.  
*''A. subcordata'' - [[Caucasian Alder]]. Caucasus, Iran.

'''Subgenus ''Clethropsis''.''' Trees or shrubs. Shoot buds stalked. Male and female catkins produced in autumn (fall) and expanding and pollinating then. Three species:
*''A. maritima'' - [[Seaside Alder]]. East coastal North America, plus disjunct population in Oklahoma.
*''A. nepalensis'' - [[Nepalese Alder]]. Eastern Himalaya, southwest China.
*''A. nitida'' - [[Himalayan Alder]]. Western Himalaya.

[[Image:Alnus serrulata leaves.jpg|right|thumb|Leaves of the [[Tag Alder]]]]
'''Subgenus ''Alnobetula''.''' Shrubs. Shoot buds not stalked. Male and female catkins produced in late spring (after leaves appear) and expanding and pollinating then. One to four species:
*''A. viridis'' - [[Green Alder]]. Widespread:
**''A. viridis'' subsp. ''viridis''. Eurasia.
**''A. viridis'' subsp. ''maximowiczii'' (''A. maximowiczii''). Japan.
**''A. viridis'' subsp. ''crispa'' (''A. crispa''). Northern North America.
**''A. viridis'' subsp. ''sinuata'' (''A. sinuata'', [[Sitka Alder]] or Slide Alder). Western North America, far northeastern Siberia.

==Uses==
[[Image:Alder female 8519.JPG|right|thumb|''Alnus serrulata'' (Tag Alder), female catkins, [[Johnsonville, South Carolina]]]]
Alders establish [[symbiosis|symbioses]] with the [[nitrogen]]-fixing [[Actinobacteria]] ''Frankiella alni''. This bacteria converts atmospheric nitrogen into soil-soluble [[nitrate]]s which can be utilised by the alder, and favorably enhances the soil fertility generally. Alders benefit other plants growing near them by taking nitrogen out of the air and depositing it in the soil in usable form; fallen alder leaves make very rich [[compost]].

Alder catkins are one of the first sources of pollen for [[bee]] species, especially [[honeybee]]s, which use it for spring buildup. Alder is a preferred wood for [[charcoal]] making, formerly used in the manufacture of [[gunpowder]], or for [[smelting]] [[metal]] [[ore]]s, now used primarily for [[cooking]]. The wood is also traditionally used for [[smoking (food)|smoking]] [[fish]] and [[meat]], though this usage has often been replaced by other woods such as [[oak]] and [[hickory]]. It is popular as a material for [[electric guitar]] bodies.

Alders are sturdy and fast-growing, even in acidic and damaged sites such as burned areas and [[mining]] sites. Italian Alder is particularly useful on dry, infertile sites. Alders can be used as a producer of simple bio-mass, growing quickly in harsh environments. Alders are sometimes made into [[bonsai]].

Alder is used as a food plant by some [[Lepidoptera]] species, see [[list of Lepidoptera which feed on Alders]].

'''Amos Bronson Alcott''' ([[November 29]], [[1799]] - [[March 4]], [[1888]]) was an [[United States|American]] teacher and writer. He is remembered for founding a short-lived and unconventional school as well as a [[utopia]]n community known as &quot;[[Fruitlands]]&quot;, and for his association with [[Transcendentalism]].

Alcott was born on [[Spindle Hill]] in the town of [[Wolcott, Connecticut|Wolcott]], [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]], [[Connecticut]]. His father, [[Joseph Chatfield Alcox]], was a [[farmer]] and [[mechanic]] whose ancestors, then bearing the name of Alcocke, had settled in eastern [[Massachusetts]] in colonial days. The son adopted the spelling &quot;Alcott&quot; in his early youth.  

Self-educated and early thrown upon his own resources, he began in 1814 to earn his living by working in a clock factory in [[Plymouth, Connecticut]], and for many years after 1815 he peddled books and merchandise, chiefly in the southern states. He began teaching in [[Bristol, Connecticut]] in 1823, and subsequently conducted schools in [[Cheshire, Connecticut]], in 1825-[[1827]], again in Bristol in 1827-1828, in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1828-[[1830]], in Germantown, now part of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], in 1831-[[1833]], and in Philadelphia in 1833. As a young teacher he was most convinced by the [[educational philosophy]] of the [[Swiss]] [[pedagogue]] [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]].

In 1830 he married [[Abby May]], the sister of [[Samuel J. May]] ([[1797]]-[[1871]]), the reformer and [[abolition]]ist. Alcott himself was a [[William Lloyd Garrison|Garrisonian]] [[abolitionist]], and pioneered the strategy of [[tax resistance]] to [[slavery]] which [[Thoreau]] made famous in ''[[Civil Disobedience]]''.  Alcott publicly debated with Thoreau the use of force and passive resistance to slavery; along with Thoreau he was among the financial and moral supporters of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and occasionally helped fugitive slaves escape on the [[Underground Railroad]].

In 1834 he opened the [[Temple School]] in Boston, which became famous because of his original methods. Alcott's plan was to develop self-instruction on the basis of self-analysis, with an emphasis on conversation rather than the lecture and drill which were prevalent in U.S. classrooms of the time. The subject matter was often the [[Gospel]]s, religious and moral principles; some of the school's conversations were published in Alcott's ''Conversations with Children on the Gospels''. Alcott refused [[corporal punishment]] as a means of disciplining his students; instead, he offered his own hand for an offending student to strike, saying that any failing was the teacher's responsibility. The shame and guilt this method induced, he believed, was far superior to the fear instilled by corporal punishment. As assistants in the school Alcott had two of [[nineteenth-century]] America's most talented women writers, [[Elizabeth Palmer Peabody]] (who published ''A Record of Mr. Alcott's School'' in 1835) and [[Margaret Fuller]]; as students he had the children of the Boston intellectual classes, including [[Josiah Quincy]], grandson of the president of [[Harvard]]. Alcott's methods were not well received; many in the church found his conversations on the Gospels close to blasphemous, and many in the public found his disciplinary measures ridiculous. The school was denounced in the press and rejected by most public opinion, and was not pecuniarily successful as the controversy caused many parents to remove their students. Finally Alcott alienated many of the remaining parents by admitting an [[African American]] child whom he then refused to expel from his classes. In 1839 the school was closed, although Alcott had won the affection of many of his pupils. His pedagogy was a forerunner of [[progressive education|progressive]] and [[democratic school]]ing.

[[Image:The Wayside, Concord, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[The Wayside]], home in turn to the Alcott family, [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and [[Margaret Sidney]].]]

In 1840 Alcott removed to [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. After a visit to [[England]], in 1842, he started with two English associates, [[Charles Lane]] and [[Henry C. Wright]], at &quot;Fruitlands&quot;, in the town of [[Harvard, Massachusetts]], a [[utopian]] [[socialist]] experiment in farm living and nature meditation as tending to develop the best powers of body and soul. The experiment quickly collapsed, and Alcott returned in 1844 to his Concord home &quot;Hillside&quot; (later renamed &quot;[[The Wayside]]&quot; by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne|Hawthorne]]) near that of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. Alcott removed to Boston four years later, and again back to Concord after 1857.  

He spoke, as opportunity offered, before the &quot;[[lyceum]]s&quot; then common in various parts of the United States, or addressed groups of hearers as they invited him. These &quot;conversations&quot; as he called them, were more or less informal talks on a great range of topics, spiritual, aesthetic and practical, in which he emphasized the ideas of the school of American [[Transcendentalist]]s led by Emerson, who was always his supporter and discreet admirer. He dwelt upon the illumination of the mind and soul by direct communion with the Creative Spirit; upon the spiritual and poetic monitions of external nature; and upon the benefit to man of a serene mood and a simple way of life.  

Alcott's philosophical teaching was, and is still, often thought inconsistent, hazy or abrupt.  But though he formulated no system of [[philosophy]], and seemed to show the influence now of [[Plato]], now of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], or of German thought as filtered through the brain of [[Coleridge]], he was, like Emerson, steadily optimistic, idealistic, and individualistic. The teachings of Dr. [[William Ellery Channing]] a little before had laid the groundwork for the work of most of the Concord Transcendentalists and contributors to ''The Dial'', of whom Alcott was one.  

In his last years, his daughter, the writer [[Louisa May Alcott]], provided for him. Alcott was gratified at being able to become the nominal, and at times the actual, head of a Concord &quot;Summer School of Philosophy and Literature&quot;, which had its first session in 1879, and in which, in a building next to his house, listeners were addressed during a part of several successive summers on many themes in philosophy, religion and letters.  

Alcott's published books, all from late in his life, included ''Tablets'' (1868), ''Concord Days'' (1872), and ''Sonnets and Canzonets'' (1882). Earlier he had written a series of ''[[Orpheus|Orphic]] Sayings'' which were published in ''The Dial'' as examples of Transcendentalist thought. The sayings, though called [[oracle|oracular]], were considered sloppy, or vague by contemporary commentators as well as [[twentieth-century]] ones. He left a large collection of personal jottings and memorabilia, most of which remain unpublished. He died in Boston on [[4 March]] [[1888]].

The '''albatrosses''' are [[seabird]]s in the [[family (biology)|family]]  '''Diomedeidae''', which is closely allied to the [[procellariidae|procellarid]]s, [[storm-petrel]]s and [[diving-petrel]]s in the order [[Procellariiformes]] (the tubenoses). They range widely in the [[Southern Ocean]] and the North [[Pacific]]. They are absent from the North [[Atlantic]] although [[fossil]] remains show they once occurred there too. Albatrosses are amongst the largest of [[bird flight|flying]] birds, and the great albatrosses from the [[genus]] ''Diomedea'' have the largest wingspans of any extant birds. 

Albatrosses are highly efficient in the air, using [[dynamic soaring]] and slope soaring to cover great distances with little exertion. They feed on [[squid]], [[fish]] and [[krill]] by either scavenging, surface seizing or diving. Albatrosses are [[seabird colony|colonial]], nesting for the most part on remote oceanic islands, often with several species nesting together. Breeding pairs form over several years and will remain together for life. A breeding season can take over a year from laying to [[fledge|fledging]], with a single [[egg (biology)|egg]] laid in each breeding season.

Nineteen of the 21 species of albatrosses are threatened with [[extinction]]. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for [[feather]]s, but today the albatrosses are threatened by  [[introduced species]] such as [[rat]]s and [[feral cat]]s that attack eggs, chicks and nesting adults; by [[pollution]]; and by [[long-line fishing]]. Long-line fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the [[bait]] and become hooked on the lines and drown. Governments, conservation organisations and fishermen are all working towards reducing this by-catch. 
==Albatross biology==
===Taxonomy and evolution===
The albatrosses comprise 21 [[species]] in 4 [[genus|genera]]. The four genera are the [[great albatross]]es (''Diomedea''), the [[mollymawk]]s (''Thalassarche''), the [[North Pacific albatross]]es (''Phoebastria''), and the [[sooty albatross]]es or sooties (''Phoebetria''). Of the four genera, the North Pacific albatrosses are considered to be a sister taxon to the great albatrosses, while the sooty albatrosses are considered closer to the mollymawks. 

The [[taxonomy]] of the albatross group has been a source of a great deal of debate. The [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]] places seabirds, [[bird of prey|birds of prey]] and many others in a greatly enlarged order [[Ciconiiformes]], whereas the ornithological organisations in North America, Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand retain the more traditional order [[Procellariiformes]]. 

Within the family, the assignment of genera has been debated for over a hundred years. Originally placed into a single genus, ''Diomedea'', they were split into four different genera in 1852, then lumped back together and split again several times, acquiring 12 different genus names in total (though never more than 8 at one time) by 1965 (''Diomedea'', ''Phoebastria'', ''Thalassarche'', ''Phoebetria'', ''Thalassageron'', ''Diomedella'', ''Nealbutrus'', ''Rhothonia'', ''Julietata'', ''Galapagornis'', ''Laysanornis'', and  ''Penthirenia''). 

By 1965, in an attempt to bring some order back to the classification of albatrosses they were lumped into two genera, ''Phoebetria'' (the 'primitive' sooty albatrosses which most closely seemed to resemble the procellarids) and ''Diomedea'' (the rest)&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, W. B., Fleming C. A., Falla R. A., Kuroda N. H., Jouanin C., Rowan M. K., Murphy R. C., Serventy D. L., Salomonsen F., Ticknell W. L. N., Voous K. H., Warham J., Watson G. E., Winterbottom J. M., and Bourne W. R. P. 1965. &quot;Correspondence: The families and genera of the petrels and their names.&quot; ''Ibis'' '''107''': 401-5.&lt;/ref&gt;. Though there was a case for the simplification of the family (particularly the nomenclature), the classification was pretty much the same as suggested by [[Elliott Coues]] in 1866, paid little attention to more recent studies and even ignored some of Coues's suggestions. 

More recent research  by Gary Nunn of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] ([[1996]]) and other researchers around the world studied the [[mitochondrial DNA]] of all the 14 accepted species, finding that there were four, not two, monophyletic groups within the albatrosses&lt;ref&gt;Nunn, G. B., Cooper, J., Jouventin, P., Robertson, C. J. R. and Robertson G. G. (1996) &quot;Evolutionary relationships among extant albatrosses (Procellariiformes: Diomedeidae) established from complete cytochrome-b gene sequences&quot;. ''Auk'' '''113''': 784-801. [http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v113n04/p0784-p0801.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. They proposed the resurrection of two of the old genus names, ''Phoebastria'' for the North Pacific albatrosses and ''Thalassarche'' for the mollymawks, with the great albatrosses retaining ''Diomedea'' and the sooty albatrosses staying in ''Phoebetria''. Both the [[British Ornithologists' Union]] and the South African authorities split the albatrosses into four genera as Nunn suggested, and the change has been accepted by the majority of researchers as well. 

While there is some agreement on the number of genera, there is less agreement on the number of species. After his work on albatross genera, Nunn went on to propose 24 different species in 1998&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, C. J. R. and Nunn, G. B. (1998) &quot;Towards a new taxonomy for albatrosses&quot; in: ''Proceedings First International Conference on the Biology and Conservation of Albatrosses'', G.Robertson &amp; R.Gales (Eds), Chipping Norton:Surrey Beatty &amp; Sons, 13-19,&lt;/ref&gt;, compared to the 14 then accepted. These changes were not universally accepted; some of his splits have been accepted while others have been rejected&lt;ref&gt;Burg, T.M., &amp; Croxall, J.P., (2004) &quot;Global population structure and taxonomy of the wandering albatross species complex&quot;. ''Molecular Ecology'' '''13''': 2345-2355. [http://biology.queensu.ca/~burgt/pdf/Burg&amp;Croxall2004.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and for the most part 21 species is the number accepted by the [[IUCN]] and many others (though by no means not allâtwo authors have called for the number of species to be returned to 14&lt;ref&gt;Penhallurick, J. and Wink, M. (2004). &quot;Analysis of the taxonomy and nomenclature of the Procellariformes based on complete nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene.&quot; ''Emu'' '''104''': 125-147.&lt;/ref&gt;}).

The molecular study of the [[evolution]] of the bird families by [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy|Sibley and Ahlquist]] has put the [[Adaptive radiation|radiation]] of the [[Procellariiformes]] in the [[Oligocene]] period (35&amp;ndash;30 million years ago), though the group has an older history, with a [[fossil]] attributed to the order, a seabird known as ''Tytthostonyx'', being found in late [[Cretaceous]] rocks (70 mya). The molecular evidence suggests that the storm-petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellarids and diving petrels. The earliest fossil albatross was found in [[South Carolina]] in rocks dating from the Upper Oligocene, though it is uncertain which [[genus]] it should be attributed to. The four genera are believed to have split more recently; a fossil albatross attributed to the North Pacific albatrosses, ''Phoebastria californica'' was found in mid [[Miocene]] rocks in [[California]], showing the split between the great albatrosses and the North Pacific albatrosses occurred by 15 mya. Similar fossil finds in the southern hemisphere put the split between the sooties and mollymawks at 10 mya&lt;ref name = &quot;Brooke&quot;&gt;Brooke, M. (2004).  ''Albatrosses And Petrels Across The World'': Procellariidae. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK ISBN 0-19-850125-0&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The fossil record of the albatrosses in the northern hemisphere is more complete than that of the southern, and many fossil forms of albatross have been found in the North [[Atlantic]], which today has no albatrosses. The remains of a colony of [[Short-tailed Albatross]]es have been uncovered on the island of [[Bermuda]], and the majority of fossil albatrosses from the North Atlantic have been of the genus ''Phoebastria'' (the North Pacific albatrosses), one, ''Phoebastria anglica'', has been found in deposits in both [[North Carolina]] and [[England]]. 

===Morphology and flight===
[[Image:Black footed albatross.jpg|thumb|250px|Unlike most Procellariiformes, albatrosses, like this Black-footed Albatross, can walk well on land.]]
The albatrosses are a group of large to very large [[bird]]s, amongst the largest of the seabirds,  with very long narrow wings, which are aerodynamically highly efficient. The [[beak|bill]] is large, strong and sharp-edged, the upper mandible terminating in a large hook. This bill is composed of several horny plates, and along the sides are the two 'tubes', long nostrils that give the [[order (biology)|order]] its name. The tubes of all albatrosses are along the sides of the bill, unlike the rest of the [[Procellariiformes]] were the tubes run along the top of the bill.  These tubes allow the albatrosses to have an acute sense of smell, an unusual ability for birds. Like other Procellariiformes they use this olfactory ability while foraging in order to locate potential food sources&lt;ref&gt;Lequette, B., Verheyden, C., Jowentin, P. (1989) &quot;Olfaction in Subantarctic seabirds: Its phylogenetic and ecological significance&quot; ''The Condor'' '''91''': 732-135. [http://scholar.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;q=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Condor/files/issues/v091n03/p0732-p0735.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. The feet have no hind toe, and the three anterior toes are completely webbed. The legs are strong for Procellariiformes, in fact uniquely amongst the order in that they and the [[giant petrel]]s are able to walk well on land. 

The adult [[plumage]] of most of the albatrosses is usually some variation of dark upper-wing and back, white undersides, often compared to that of a [[gull]]. At one extreme the [[Wandering Albatross]] is almost completely white except for the ends of the wings, at the other the [[Amsterdam Albatross]] has an almost juvenile like breeding plumage with a great deal of brown, particularly a strong brown band around the chest. Several species of [[mollymawk]]s and [[North Pacific albatross]]es have face and head markings like eye patches or are grey or yellow instead of white. Three albatross species, the [[Black-footed Albatross]] and the two [[Sooty albatross]]es vary completely from the usual patterns and are almost entirely black (or dark grey in the case of the [[Sooty Albatross]]). Albatrosses take several years to get their full adult breeding plumage. 

The wingspans of the largest great albatrosses (genus ''Diomedea'') are the largest of any bird, exceeding 340 cm, although the other species' wingspans are considerably smaller. The wings are cambered, with thickened streamlined leading edges. Albatrosses travel huge distances with two techniques used by many long-winged seabirds, [[dynamic soaring]] and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring enables them to minimise the effort needed by gliding across wave fronts gaining [[energy]] from the vertical [[wind gradient]]. Slope soaring is more straightforward, the albatross turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Albatross have high glide ratios, around 22:23, meaning that for every metre they drop they can travel forwards 22 metres. They are aided in soaring by a shoulder-lock, a sheet of [[tendon]] that locks the wing when fully extended, allowing the wing to be kept up and out without any muscle expenditure, a morphological adaptation they share with the giant petrels&lt;ref&gt;Pennycuick, C. J. (1982). &quot;The flight of petrels and albatrosses (Procellariiformes), observed in South Georgia and its vicinity&quot;. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B'' '''300''': 75â106.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[Image:Albatross_shape.png|thumb|left|200px|Slope soaring and dynamic soaring allow albatrosses to travel great distances with little exertion.]]
Albatrosses combine these soaring techniques with the use of predictable [[weather]] systems; albatrosses in the southern hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route and those flying south will fly anticlockwise&lt;ref name =&quot;tick&quot;&gt;Tickell, W.L.N. (2000). ''Albatrosses''.  Sussex:Pica Press, ISBN 1-873403-94-1&lt;/ref&gt;. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their [[heart rate]]s while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, takeoffs and hunting they undertake having found a food source&lt;ref&gt;Weimerskirch H, Guionnet T, Martin J, Shaffer SA, Costa DP. (2000) &quot;Fast and fuel efficient? Optimal use of wind by flying albatrosses.&quot;  ''Proc Biol Sci'' '''267''': (1455) 1869-74. &lt;/ref&gt;. This efficient long distance travelling underlies the albatross's success as a long distance forager, covering great distances and expending little energy looking for patchily distributed food sources.

===Distribution and range at sea===
All albatrosses range in the southern hemisphere except for the four North Pacific albatrosses, of which three occur exclusively in the North Pacific, from Hawaii to Japan, California and Alaska; and one, the [[Waved Albatross]], breeds on the [[equator]] in the [[Galapagos Islands]] and feeds off the coast of [[South America]]. The need for wind in order to glide is the reason albatrosses are for the most part confined to higher latitudes, since they are unsuited to sustained flapping flight, and are usually incapable of crossing the [[doldrums]]. The exception to this rule is the Waved Albatross, which breeds and feeds in the equatorial waters around the Galapagos Islands, it is able to live there because of the cool waters of the [[Humboldt Current]]. 
 
It is not known for certain why the albatrosses became [[extinct]] in the North [[Atlantic]], although rising sea levels due to an [[interglacial]] warming period are thought to have submerged the Short-tailed Albatross colony found in Bermuda&lt;ref&gt;Olson, S.L., Hearty, P.J. (2003) &quot;Probable extirpation of a breeding colony of Short-tailed Albatross (''Phoebastria albatrus'') on Bermuda by Pleistocene sea-level rise.&quot; ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Science'' '''100''': (22) 12825-12829.&lt;/ref&gt;. Some southern species that have occasionally turned up as [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrants]] in the North Atlantic have essentially become exiled and can remain there for decades. One of these exiles, a [[Black-browed Albatross]], returned to [[gannet]] colonies in [[Scotland]] for many years in a lonely attempt to breed&lt;ref name = &quot;Brit&quot;&gt;Cocker, M., &amp; Mabey, R., (2005) ''Birds Britannica'' London:Chatto &amp; Windus, ISBN 0-701-16907-9&lt;/ref&gt;.

The use of [[satellite tracking]] is teaching scientists a great deal about the way albatrosses forgae across the ocean in order to find food. They undertake no annual [[bird migration|migration]], but disperse widely after breeding, in the case of southern hemisphere species often undertaking circumpolar trips&lt;ref&gt;Croxall, J. P., Silk, J.R.D., Phillips, R.A., Afanasyev, V., Briggs, D.R., (2005) &quot;Global Circumnaviagtions: Tracking year-round ranges of nonbreeding Albatrosses&quot; ''Science'' '''307''': 249-250.&lt;/ref&gt;. There is also evidence that there is separation the ranges of different species at sea. Comparing the foraging [[niche]]s of two related species that breed on [[Campbell Island]], the [[Campbell Albatross]] and the [[Grey-headed Albatross]], the Campbell Albatross primarily fed over the [[Campbell Plateau]] whereas the the Grey-Headed Albatross fed over oceanic waters. [[Wandering Albatross]]es also react strongly to [[bathymetry]], feeding only in waters deeper than 1000m; so rigidly did the satellite plots match this contour that one scientist remarked &quot;it almost appears as if the birds notice and obey a 'No Entry' sign where the water shallows to less than 1000m&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Brooke&quot;&gt;Brooke, M. (2004).  ''Albatrosses And Petrels Across The World'': Procellariidae. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK ISBN 0-19-850125-0&lt;/ref&gt;. There is also evidence of differing ranges for the sexes of the same species,  one study showed that male [[Wandering Albatross]]es forage further south than females.

===Diet===
The albatross diet is dominated by [[cephalopod]]s, [[fish]] and [[crustacean]]s, although they will also scavenge [[carrion]] and feed on other [[zooplankton]]&lt;ref name =&quot;tick&quot;&gt;Tickell, W.L.N. (2000). ''Albatrosses''.  Sussex:Pica Press, ISBN 1-873403-94-1&lt;/ref&gt;. It should be noted that for most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is only known for the breeding season, when the albatrosses are on land and study is possible. The importance of each of these varies from species to species, and even from population to population, some concentrate on [[squid]] alone, others take more krill, or fish. Of the two albatross species found in [[Hawaii]], one, the [[Black-footed Albatross]] takes mostly fish while the [[Laysan Albatross|Laysan]] feeds on squid. 

The use of dataloggers at sea that record ingestion of water against time (providing a likely time of feeding) suggest that albatross predominantly feed during the day. Analysis of the squid beaks regurgitated by albatrosses has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive&lt;ref&gt;Croxall, J.P. &amp; Prince, P.A. (1994). &quot;Dead or alive, night or day: how do albatrosses catch squid?&quot; ''Antarctic Science'' '''6''': 155â162.&lt;/ref&gt;, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatross, suggesting that, for some species (like the [[Wandering Albatross]]), scavenged squid may be an important part of the diet. The source of these dead squid is a matter of debate, some certainly comes from squid [[fisheries]], but in nature it probably came from the die-off that occurs after squid spawning and the vomit of squid-eating [[whale]]s ([[sperm whale]]s, [[pilot whale]]s and [[Southern Bottlenose Whale]]s), or possibly some other source. The diet of other species, like the [[Black-browed Albatross]] or the [[Grey-headed Albatross]], is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death, and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet.  

Until recently it was thought that albatross were predominantly surface feeders, swimming at the surface and snapping up squid and fish pushed to the surface by currents, other predators or death. The deployment of capillary depth recorders, which record the maximum dive depth undertaken by a bird (between attaching it to a bird and recovering it when it returns to land), has shown that while some species, like the [[Wandering Albatross]], do not dive deeper than a metre, some species, like the [[Light-mantled Sooty Albatross]], have a mean diving depth of almost 5m and can dive as deep as 12.5 m&lt;ref&gt;Prince, P.A., Huin, N., Weimerskirch, H., (1994) &quot;Diving depths of albatrosses&quot; ''Antarctic Science'' '''6''': (''3'') 353-354.&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to surface feeding and diving they have now also been observed plunge diving from the air to snatch prey&lt;ref&gt;Cobley, N.D., (1996) &quot;An observation of live prey capture by a Black-browed Albatross ''Diomedea melanophrys'' &quot; ''Marine Ornithology'' '''24''': 45-46.[http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/24/24_10.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Breeding===
[[Image:Diomedea epomorpha (Mattern).jpg|thumb|230px|right|Southern Royal Albatrosses nest on remote islands as well as on the Otago Peninsula in the city of Dunedin, New Zealand]]
Albatrosses are [[seabird colony|colonial]], usually nesting on isolated islands; where colonies are on larger landmasses they are found on exposed headlands with good approaches from the sea in several directions, like the colony on the [[Otago Peninsula]] in  [[Dunedin, New Zealand]]. Colonies vary from the very dense aggregations favoured by the mollymawks ([[Black-browed Albatross]] colonies on the [[Falkland Islands]] have densities of 70 nests per 100 mÂ²) to the much looser groups and widely spaced individual nests favoured by the sooty and great albatrosses. All albatross colonies are on islands that historically were free of land [[mammal]]s. Albatrosses are highly [[philopatry|philopatric]], meaning they will usually return to their natal colony to breed. This tendency to return is so strong that a study of [[Laysan Albatross]] showed that that average distance between hatching site and the site a bird established its own territory was 22 m&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, H.I., (1976) &quot;Some dynamics of a breeding colony of Laysan Albatrosses.  ''Wilson Bulletin'' '''88''': 121-142.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[Image:Phoebastria irrorata NOAA mvey0649.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bill clashing is one of the stereotyped actions of Waved Albatross breeding dances]]
Like most seabirds, albatrosses are [[K-selected]] with regard to their life-history, meaning they live much longer than other birds, they delay breeding for longer, and invest more effort into fewer young. Albatrosses are very long lived.  Most species survive upwards of 60 years, the oldest recorded being a [[Northern Royal Albatross]] that was [[Bird ringing|ringed]] as an adult and survived for another 51 years, giving it an estimated age of 61&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, C.J.R. (1993). &quot;Survival and longevity of the Northern Royal Albatross ''Diomedea epomophora sanfordi'' at Taiaroa Head&quot; 1937-93. ''Emu'' '''93''': 269-276.&lt;/ref&gt;. Given that most albatross ringing projects are considerably younger than that, is seems likely that other species will prove to live that long and even longer.

Albatrosses reach [[sexual maturity]] slowly, after about 5 years, but even once they have reached maturity they will not begin to breed for another couple of years (even up to 10 years for some species). Young non-breeders will still attend a colony prior to beginning to breed, spending many years practicing the elaborate breeding rituals and &quot;dances&quot; that the family is famous for&lt;ref&gt;Jouventin, P., Monicault, G. de &amp; Blosseville, J.M. (1981) &quot;La danse de l'albatros, ''Phoebetria fusca''&quot;. ''Behaviour'' '''78''':  43-80.&lt;/ref&gt;. Birds arriving back at the colony for the first time already have the stereotyped behaviours that compose albatross [[language]], but can neither &quot;read&quot; that behaviour as exhibited by other birds nor respond appropriately&lt;ref name =&quot;tick&quot;&gt;Tickell, W.L.N. (2000). ''Albatrosses''.  Sussex:Pica Press, ISBN 1-873403-94-1&lt;/ref&gt;. After a period of trial and error [[learning]], the young birds learn the [[syntax]] and perfect the dances. This language is mastered more rapidly if the younger birds are around older birds. 

The repertoire of behaviour involves synchronised performances of various actions such as [[preen]]ing, pointing, calling, bill clacking, staring, and combinations of such behaviours (like the sky-call)&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, S.P.C., &amp; Berrow, S.D., (2001) &quot;Courtship behaviour of the Wandering Albatross ''Diomedea exulans'' at Bird Island, South Georgia&quot; ''Marine Ornithology'' '''29''': 29-37 [http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/29_1/29_1_6.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. As they progress the number of birds they interact with drops until they choose one partner. They then continue to perfect an individual language that will eventually be unique to that one pair. Having established a pair bond that will last for life, however, most of that dance will never be used ever again. The 'divorce' of a pair is a rare occurrence, usually only happening after several years of breeding failure. 

[[Image:Albatros_ceja_negra_-_paso_drake_-_noviembre_2005.jpg|thumb|250px|Black-browed albatross flying over the Drake Passage]]
The reason for the elaborate and painstaking rituals is to ensure that the correct partner has been chosen, and to perfect recognition of their partner, as egg laying and chick rearing is a huge investment, and even species that can complete an egg-laying cycle in under a year seldom lay eggs in consecutive years&lt;ref name = &quot;Brooke&quot;&gt;Brooke, M. (2004).  ''Albatrosses And Petrels Across The World'': Procellariidae. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK ISBN 0-19-850125-0&lt;/ref&gt;. The great albatrosses (like the [[Wandering Albatross]]) take over a year to raise a chick from laying to [[fledge|fledging]]. Albatrosses lay a single [[egg (biology)|egg]]; if the egg is lost to predators or accidentally broken then no further breeding attempts are made that year.  

All the southern albatrosses create large [[nest]]s for their egg, whereas the three species in the north Pacific make more rudimentary nests. The [[Waved Albatross]], on the other hand, makes no nest and will even move its egg around the pair's territory, as much as 50 m, sometimes causing it to lose the egg&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, D.J. &amp; Cruz, F. (1998) &quot;Biology  and management of the Waved Albatross at the Galapagos Islands. Pp.105-109 in ''Albatross Biology and Conservation'' (Roberston , G. &amp; Gales, R. eds) Chipping Norton:Surrey Beatty and &amp; Sons ISBN: 0949324825 &lt;/ref&gt;. In all albatrosses species both parents [[incubate]] the egg, in stints that last between one day to three weeks. Incubation lasts around 70&amp;ndash;80 days (longer for the larger albatrosses), the longest incubation period of any bird. It can be an energetically demanding process, with the adult losing as much as 83 g of body weight a day&lt;ref&gt;Warham, J. (1990) ''The Petrels - Their Ecology and Breeding Systems'' London:Academic Press. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

After hatching the chick is brooded and guarded for three weeks until it is large enough to defend and [[thermoregulation|thermoregulate]] itself. During this period the chick is fed regularly with small meals by its parents when they relieve each other from duty. After the brooding period is over the chick is fed in regular intervals by both parents. The parents adopt alternative patterns of short and long foraging trips, providing meals that weigh around 12% of their body weight (around 600 g). The meals are composed of both fresh [[squid]], [[fish]] and [[krill]], as well as [[stomach oil]], an [[food energy|energy]]-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items&lt;ref&gt;Warham, J. (1976) &quot;The incidence, function and ecological significance of petrel stomach oils.&quot; ''Proceedings of the New Zealand Ecological Society'' '''24''': 84-93&lt;/ref&gt;. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items by all tubenoses, and gives them their distinctive musty smell.

Albatross chicks take a long time to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses it can up to 280 days, even for the smaller albatrosses it takes anywhere between 170 and 140 days&lt;ref name =&quot;delhoyo&quot;&gt;Carboneras, C. (1992) &quot;Family Diomedeidae (Albatross)&quot; in ''Handbook of Birds of the World'' Vol 1. Barcelona:Lynx Edicions, ISBN 84-87334-10-5&lt;/ref&gt;. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will actually gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Albatross chicks fledge on their own, and receive no further help from their parents, who will actually return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, that helps young birds first at sea&lt;ref&gt;Ãkesson, S., &amp; Weimerskirch, H., (2005) &quot;Albatross Long-Distance Navigation: Comparing Adults And Juveniles&quot; ''Journal of Navigation'' '''58''': 365-373.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Albatrosses and humans==
===Etymology===
The name albatross is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''al-cÃ¢dous'', (a [[pelican]]), which travelled to English via the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] form ''Alcatraz''.  The [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] notes that the word ''alcatraz'' was originally applied to the [[frigatebird]]; the modification to ''albatross'' was perhaps influenced by [[Latin]] ''alba'' meaning &quot;white&quot;, in contrast to frigatebirds which are black.

They were once commonly known as '''Goonie birds''' or '''Gooney birds''', particularly those of the North [[Pacific]]. In the southern hemisphere the name '''mollymawk''' is still well established in some areas, which is a corrupted form of ''malle-mugge'', an old [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name for the [[Northern Fulmar]]. The name ''Diomedea'', assigned to the albatrosses by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] references the mythical metamorphosis of the companions of the Greek warrior [[Diomedes]] into birds.

===Albatrosses and culture===
Albatrosses have been described as &quot;the most legendary of all birds&quot;&lt;ref name =&quot;delhoyo&quot;&gt;Carboneras, C. (1992) &quot;Family Diomedeidae (Albatross)&quot; in ''Handbook of Birds of the World'' Vol 1. Barcelona:Lynx Edicions, ISBN 84-87334-10-5&lt;/ref&gt;. They feature prominently in [[poetry]] such as the [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] poem ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. In part due to the poem, there is a widespread [[urban legend|myth]] that sailors believe it disastrous to shoot or harm an albatross; in truth, however, sailors regularly killed and ate them&lt;ref name = &quot;Brit&quot;&gt;Cocker, M., &amp; Mabey, R., (2005) ''Birds Britannica'' London:Chatto &amp; Windus, ISBN 0-701-16907-9&lt;/ref&gt;. But they were often regarded as the souls of lost sailors. More recently they have become part of [[popular culture]], for example, in a [[Monty Python]] [[Albatross (Monty Python sketch)|sketch]], or the song [[Echoes (1971 song)|Echoes]] by [[Pink Floyd]]. In the movie ''[[Serenity_(film)|Serenity]]'', the character River was refered to as an albatross by The Operative, in the context of Coleridge's poem.

===Threats and conservation===
In spite of often being accorded legendary status by people albatrosses have not escaped both indirect and direct pressure from humanity. Early encounters with albatrosses by [[Polynesia]]ns and [[Aleut]] Indians resulted in hunting and in some cases expiration from some islands (such as [[Easter Island]]). As [[European]]s began sailing the world they too began to hunt albatross, &quot;fishing&quot; for them from boats to serve at the table or blasting them for sport&lt;ref&gt;Safina, C. (2002) ''Eye of the Albatross: Visions of Hope and Survival'' New York:Henry Holt &amp; Company ISBN: 0805062297&lt;/ref&gt;. This sport reached its peak on emigration lines bound for [[Australia]], and only died down when ships became too fast to fish from, and regulations stopped the discharge of weapons for safety reasons. In the 19th century, albatross colonies, particularly those in the North Pacific, were harvested for the feather trade, leading to the near extinction of the [[Short-tailed Albatross]].

According to the [[IUCN Red List]], 19 of the 21 albatross species are considered to have a [[conservation status]] as vulnerable or worse&lt;ref&gt;IUCN, 2004. [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/search.php?freetext=Albatross&amp;modifier=phrase&amp;criteria=wholedb&amp;taxa_species=1&amp;redlistCategory%5B%5D=allex&amp;redlistAssessyear%5B%5D=all&amp;country%5B%5D=all&amp;aquatic%5B%5D=all&amp;regions%5B%5D=all&amp;habitats%5B%5D=all&amp;threats%5B%5D=all&amp;Submit.x=104&amp;Submit.y=16 Red List: Albatross Species].  Retrieved [[September 13]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;, partially due to the impact of commercial [[long-line fishing]]&lt;ref&gt;Brothers NP. 1991. &quot;Albatross mortality and associated bait loss in the Japanese longline fishery in the southern ocean.&quot; ''Biological Conservation'' '''55''': 255-268.&lt;/ref&gt;, as the albatrosses and other [[seabird]]s are attracted to the set bait, become hooked on the lines and drown. The scale of the problem is made worse by [[pirate]] fisheries, and an estimated 100,000 albatross are killed a year in this fashion. Two species (as recognised by the IUCN) are considered critically [[endangered species|endangered]], the [[Amsterdam Albatross]] and the [[Chatham Albatross]]. 

Another threat to albatrosses is [[introduced species]], which can be predators, like rats or [[feral cat]]s, directly attacking the albatross or its chicks and eggs; or they can have indirect effects, cattle overgrazed essential cover on [[Amsterdam Island]]; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat. 

[[Image:albab.jpg|thumb|200px|Black-browed Albatrosses are one of the many species threatened by long-line fisheries]]
Ingestion of floating [[plastic]] [[flotsam]] is another problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount of plastic in the seas has increased dramatically since the first record in the 1960s, coming from waste discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or [[gizzard]] that should be used for food, or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining [[body weight]] and body condition&lt;ref&gt;Spear, L.B., Ainley, D.G. &amp; Ribic, C.A. (1995). &quot;Incidence of plastic in seabirds from the tropical Pacific, 1984â91: relation with distribution of species, sex, age, season, year and body weight.&quot; ''Marine Environmental Research'' '''40''': 123â146. &lt;/ref&gt;. This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of [[Laysan Albatross]] chicks on [[Midway Atoll]] showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents&lt;ref&gt;Auman, H.J., Ludwig, J.P., Giesy, J.P., Colborn, T., (1997) &quot;Plastic ingestion by Laysan Albatross chicks on Sand Island, Midway Atoll, in 1994 and 1995.&quot; in ''Albatross Biology and Conservation'', (ed by G. Robinson and R. Gales). Surrey Beatty &amp; Sons:Chipping Norton. Pp. 239-44 [http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Ocean/Albatross-Plastic-Ingestion1997.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;. While not the direct cause of death, this plastic caused physiological stress and caused the chick to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake and reducing the chances of survival.  

Scientists and conservationists (most importantly [[BirdLife International]] and their partners, who have run a Save the Albatross campaign) are working with governments and [[fishermen]] to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines and using bird scarers  can all reduce the by-catch in seabirds by fishing fleets&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organisation (1999) &quot;The incidental catch of seabirds by longline fisheries: worldwide review and technical guidelines for mitigation. FAO Fisheries Circular No.937. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome. [http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/DOCREP/005/W9817E/W9817E00.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in [[New Zealand]] successfully tested a underwater setting device for long-liners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable  albatross species&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, Decland &amp; Molloy, Janice (2000) &quot;Preliminary performance assessment of an underwater line setting device for pelagic longline fishing&quot; ''New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research'' '''34''': 455-461. [http://www.rsnz.org/publish/nzjmfr/2000/36.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. The use of some of these techniques in the [[Patagonian Toothfish]] fishery in the [[Falkland Islands]] is thought to have reduced the number of [[Black-browed Albatross]] taken by the fleet in the last 10 years&lt;ref&gt;Reid, A.T., Sullivan, B.J., Pompert,J., Enticott, J.W., Black, A.D., (2004) &quot;Seabird mortality associated with Patagonian Toothfish (''Dissostichus eleginoides'') longliners in Falkland Islands waters.&quot; ''Emu'' '''104''': (4) 317-325.&lt;/ref&gt;. Conservationists have also worked on the field of [[island restoration]], removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators.

One important step towards protecting albatrosses and other [[seabird]] is the 2001 [[treaty]] the [[Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels]], which came into force in 2004 and has been ratified by eight countries, [[Australia]], [[Ecuador]], [[New Zealand]], [[Spain]], [[South Africa]], [[France]], [[Peru]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. This treaty requires specific actions to be taken by these countries to reduce by-catch, pollution and remove introduced species from nesting islands. The treaty has also been signed but not ratified by another three countries, [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]].

==Species==
Current thinking divides the albatrosses into four genera. The number of species is a matter of some debate, the [[IUCN]] and [[BirdLife International]] among others recognise 21 species, other authorities retain the more traditional 14 species:

'''Arachnophobia''' is a [[specific phobia]], an abnormal fear of [[spider (animal)|spiders]]. It is among the most common phobias. The reactions of arachnophobics often seem irrational to others (and sometimes to sufferers themselves, as well).  People with arachnophobia may stay away from any area they believe to be inhabited by numerous spiders or covered in spider webs. If they see a spider they may not enter the general vicinity until they overcome the panic attack that is often associated with it. Like most phobias the fear can be overcome by psychological treatments and through gradual exposure to the object. Another technique is 'flooding', in which the phobic person is suddenly exposed to a high intensity stimulus.

Arachnophobia is, in many cases, the result of a traumatizing encounter with spiders in one's early childhood, though the experience may not be remembered. Then, considering the extreme diversity of phobias, always inexplicable and sometimes exceedingly strange, (fear of carrot â as such and not as food â fear of glitter powder, and others.) One hypothesis states that while some phobias are the result of a traumatic event, most are the result of a random brain wiring that causes inexplicable fear at the sight of a seemingly innocuous thing or animal. The main phobias, such as arachnophobia, fear of spiders, [[claustrophobia]], stand out by their prevalence because they would have given over thousands of years a survival edge to sufferers and their offspring. Spiders, for instance, being relatively small, donât fit the usual criteria for a threat in the animal kingdom where size is a key factor, but most species are [[Venom (poison)|venomous]], and some are lethal. Arachnophobics will spare no effort to make sure that their wherabouts are spider-free, hence reducing sharply the risk of being bitten.

'''Alabaster''' (sometimes called '''satin spar''') is a name applied to varieties of two distinct [[mineral]]s: [[gypsum]] (a [[hydroxy|hydrous]] [[sulfur|sulfate]] of [[calcium]]) and the  [[calcite]] (a [[carbonate]] of calcium).  The former is the alabaster of the present day; the latter is generally the alabaster of the ancients. 

The two kinds are readily distinguished from each other by their relative '''hardnesses'''. The gypsum kind is so soft as to be readily scratched by a finger-nail ([[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]]  1.5 to 2), while the calcite kind is too hard to be scratched in this way (hardness 3), though it does yield readily to a knife. Moreover, the calcite alabaster, being a [[carbonate]], effervesces on being touched with [[hydrochloric acid]], whereas the gypsum alabaster, when so treated, remains practically unaffected. 

==Types==
=== Calcite Alabaster ===
This substance, the &quot;alabaster&quot; of the [[Bible]], is often termed ''Oriental alabaster'', since the early examples came from the [[Far East]]. The [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''alabastrites'' is said to be derived from the town of Alabastron, in [[Egypt]], where the stone was quarried, but the locality probably owed its name to the mineral; the origin of the mineral-name is obscure, and it has been suggested that it may have had an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin. This &quot;Oriental&quot; alabaster was highly esteemed for making small perfume-bottles or ointment vases called alabastra, and this has been conjectured to be a possible source of the name. Alabaster was also employed in Egypt for [[canopic jar]]s and various other sacred and sepulchral objects. A splendid [[sarcophagus]], sculptured in a single block of translucent calcite alabaster from Alabastron, is in the [[Soane Museum]], [[London]].  This was discovered by [[Giovanni Belzoni]] in [[1817]] in the tomb of [[Seti I]] near [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. It was purchased by Sir [[John Soane]], having previously been offered to the [[British Museum]].

When cut in thin sheets, alabaster is translucent enough to be used for small windows, and has been used so in [[medieval]] churches, especially in [[Italy]]. Large alabaster sheets are used extensively in the ''Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels'' (dedicated 2002) of the [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles|Los Angeles (California) Archdiocese]]. The cathedral incorporates special cooling to prevent the panes from overheating and turning opaque.

Calcite alabaster is either a [[stalagmite|stalagmitic]] deposit, from the floor and walls of [[limestone]] [[cavern]]s, or a kind of [[travertine]], similarly deposited in springs of calcareous water. Its deposition in successive layers gives rise to the banded appearance that 
the marble often shows on cross-section, whence it is known as onyx-marble or alabaster-onyx, or sometimes simply as [[onyx]] &amp;ndash; a term which should, however, be restricted to siliceous 
minerals.  Egyptian alabaster has been extensively worked near [[Suez]] and near [[Assiut]]; there are many ancient quarries in the hills overlooking the plain of [[Tell el Amarna]].  The 
[[Algeria]]n onyx-marble has been largely quarried in the province of [[Oran]]. In [[Mexico]], there are famous deposits of a delicate green variety at [[La Pedrara]], in the district of [[Tecali]], near [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]]. Onyx-marble occurs also in the district of [[TehuacÃ¡n]] and at several localities in [[California]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]] and [[Virginia]].

=== Gypsum Alabaster ===

In the present day, when the term &quot;alabaster&quot; is used without any qualification, it invariably means a fine-grained variety of gypsum.  This mineral, or alabaster proper, occurs in [[England]].  However, thousands of gypsum alabaster [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s dating to the late [[4th millennium BC]] have been found in [[Tell Brak]] (present day [[Nagar]]), in [[Syria]] [http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;item=1988.323.8&amp;viewmode=0&amp;isHighlight=1].  And in [[Mesopotamia]], a gypsum alabaster [[sculpture]], believed to represent the god [[Abu]], dates to the first half of the [[3rd millennium BC]] [http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=40%2E156].

Mineral alabaster occurs in [[England]] in the [[Keuper]] [[marl]]s of the [[Midlands]], especially at [[Chellaston]] in [[Derbyshire]], at [[Fauld]] in [[Staffordshire]] and near [[Newark, England|Newark]] in [[Nottinghamshire]].  At all these localities it has been extensively worked. Indeed, in the [[15th century]] its carving into [[icons]] and [[altarpiece]]s, was a valuable local industry in these areas, as well as a major English export.  Besides examples of these still in Britain (especially at the [[Nottingham Castle Museum]], [[British Museum]] and [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]), that trade in itself (rather than just the antiques trade) has scattered examples as far afield as the [[MusÃ©e de Cluny]] and ...........

Alabaster is also found, though in subordinate quantity, at [[Watchet]] in [[Somerset]], near [[Penarth]] in [[Glamorganshire]], and elsewhere.  In [[Cumbria]] it occurs largely in the New Red rocks, but at a lower geological horizon. The alabaster of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire is found in 
thick nodular beds or &quot;floors&quot; in spheroidal masses known as &quot;balls&quot; or &quot;bowls,&quot; and in smaller lenticular masses termed &quot;cakes.&quot; At Chellaston, where the alabaster is known as &quot;Patrick,&quot; it has been worked into ornaments under the name of &quot;Derbyshire spar&quot; &amp;ndash; a term more properly applied to [[fluorspar]].  

[[image:alabaster-satin spar.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Unlike the lamp, this fine alabaster sculpture is untreated: Its translucency and satiny lustre are preserved. Its base is of marble.]]

The finer kinds of alabaster are largely employed as an [[ornamental stone]], especially for [[ecclesiastical]] decoration and for the rails of staircases and halls. Its softness enables it to be readily carved into elaborate forms, but its solubility in water renders it inapplicable to outdoor work.  The purest alabaster is a snow-white material of fine tiniforni grain, but it is often associated with an oxide of [[iron]], which produces brown clouding and veining in the stone. The coarser varieties of alabaster are converted by calcination into [[plaster of Paris]], whence they are sometimes known as &quot;plaster stone.&quot;

On the continent of [[Europe]], the centre of the alabaster trade is [[Florence, Italy]]. [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] alabaster occurs in nodular masses embedded in limestone, interstratified with [[marl]]s of [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] age. The mineral is largely worked by means of underground galleries,in the district of [[Volterra]]. Several varieties are recognized &amp;ndash; veined, spotted, clouded, agatiform, and others. The finest kind, obtained principally from [[Castellina]], is sent to Florence for figure-sculpture, while the common kinds are carved at a very cheap rate locally into vases, clock-cases and various ornamental objects, in which a large trade is carried on, especially in Florence, [[Pisa]] and [[Livorno|Leghorn]].  

In order to diminish the [[Translucent|translucenc]]y of the alabaster and to produce an opacity suggestive of true marble, the statues are immersed in a bath of water and gradually heated nearly to the boiling-point &amp;ndash; an operation requiring great care, for if the temperature is not carefully regulated, the stone acquires a dead-white, chalky appearance. The effect of heating appears to be a partial dehydration of the gypsum. If properly treated, it very closely resembles true marble and is known as [[marmo di Castellina]]. It should be noted that sulphate of lime (gypsum) was used also by the ancients, and was employed, for instance, in Assyrian sculpture, so that some of the ancient alabaster is identical with the modern stone. 

Alabaster may be stained by digesting it, after being heated in various pigmentary solutions. In this way a good imitation of [[coral]] has been produced (alabaster coral).

''Black Alabaster'' is a rare form of the gypsum-based mineral found in only three veins in the world, one each in [[Oklahoma]] (USA), Italy and [[China]].

[[Alabaster Caverns State Park]], near [[Freedom, Oklahoma]] is home to a natural [[gypsum cave]] in which much of the gypsum is in the form of alabaster. There are several types of alabaster found at the site, including pink, white, and the rare black alabaster.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ahab''' or '''Ach'av''' ('''&amp;#1488;&amp;#1463;&amp;#1495;&amp;#1456;&amp;#1488;&amp;#1464;&amp;#1489;''' &quot;Brother of the father&quot;, [[Standard Hebrew]] '''A&amp;#7717;&amp;#700;av''', [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''&amp;#700;A&amp;#7717;&amp;#259;&amp;#700;&amp;#257;&amp;#7687;''', '''&amp;#700;A&amp;#7723;&amp;#700;&amp;#257;&amp;#7687;''') was King of the [[Kingdom of Israel]] and the province of [[Samaria]], and the son and successor of [[Omri]] (''[[Books of Kings|1 Kings]]'' 16:29-34). [[William F. Albright]] has dated his reign to [[869 BC]]-[[850 BC]], while [[E. R. Thiele]] offers the dates [[874 BC]]-[[853 BC]].

He married [[Jezebel (biblical)|Jezebel]], the daughter of king [[Ithobaal I]] of [[Tyre]], and the alliance was doubtless the means of procuring him great riches, which brought pomp and luxury in their train. We read of his building an ivory palace (''1 Kings'' 22:39; ''[[Book of Amos|Amos]]'' 3:15), and founding new cities, the effect perhaps of a share in the flourishing commerce of [[Phoenicia]], who supplied the ivory for his palace.

The material prosperity of his reign, which is comparable with that of [[Solomon]] a century before, was overshadowed by the religious changes which his marriage involved. Although he worshipped YHWH, as the names of his children prove (''1 Kings'' 22:5ff), his wife was firmly attached to the worship of the [[Melkart]] (the Tyrian [[Ba'al]]), and led by her he gave a great impulse to this cult by building a temple in honour of Baal in [[Samaria]]. This roused the indignation of the Jewish prophets and Priests whose aim it was to purify the worship of [[God]]. (See [[Elijah (prophet)|Elijah]]) 

During Ahab's reign [[Moab]], which had been conquered by his father, remained tributary; [[kingdom of Judah|Judah]], with whose king, [[Jehoshaphat]], he was allied by marriage, was probably his vassal; only with [[Damascus]] is he said to have had strained relations.  

The one event mentioned by external sources is the [[Battle of Karkar]] (perhaps at [[Apamea]]), where [[Shalmaneser III]] of [[Assyria]] fought a great confederation of princes from [[Cilicia]], Northern [[Syria]], Israel, [[Ammon]] and the tribes of the Syrian desert ([[853 BC]]).  Here Ahab (''A-ha-ab-bu &lt;sup&gt;mat&lt;/sup&gt;Sir-'i-la-a-a'' or &quot;Ahab the Israelite&quot;) joined [[Baasha]], son of [[Ruhub]] (Rehob) of Ammon and nine others are allied with [[Hadadezer]] (''Bir-'idri''), Ahab's contribution being reckoned at 2,000 chariots and 10,000 men. The numbers are comparatively large and possibly include forces from [[Tyre]], Judah, [[Edom]] and [[Moab]]. The Assyrian king claimed a victory, but his immediate return and subsequent expeditions in [[849 BC]] and [[846 BC]] against a similar but unspecified coalition seem to show that he met with no lasting success. According to the [[Old Testament]], however, Ahab with 7,000 troops had previously overthrown [[Ben-hadad]] and his thirty-two kings, who had come to lay siege to Samaria, and in the following year obtained a remarkable victory over him at [[Aphek]], probably in the [[plain of Sharon]] (''1 Kings'' 20). A treaty was made whereby Ben-hadad restored the cities which his father had taken from Ahab's father (that is, Omri, but see 15:20, ''[[Books of Kings|2 Kings]]'' 13:25), and trading facilities between Damascus and Samaria were granted.  

A late popular story (20:35-42, akin in tone to 12:33-13:34) condemned Ahab for his leniency and foretold the destruction of the king and his land. Three years later, war broke out on the east of the [[Jordan River]], and Ahab with Jehoshaphat of Judah went to recover [[Battle of Ramoth-Gilead|Ramoth-Gilead]] and was mortally wounded (ch. 22). He was succeeded by his sons ([[Ahaziah]] and [[Jehoram]]). 

It is very difficult to obtain any clear idea of the order of these events (the [[Septuagint]] places ''1 Kings'' 21 immediately after 19). How the hostile kings of Israel and Syria came to fight a common enemy, and how to correlate the Assyrian and Biblical records, are questions which have perplexed all recent writers.  The reality of the difficulties will be apparent from the fact that it has been suggested that the Assyrian scribe wrote &quot;Ahab&quot; for his son &quot;Jehoram&quot;, and that the very identification of the name with Ahab of Israel has been questioned.
 
Whilst the above passages from ''1 Kings'' view Ahab not unfavourably, there are others which are less friendly. The murder of [[Naboth]] (see [[Jezebel (biblical)|Jezebel]]), an act of royal encroachment, stirred up popular resentment just as the new cult aroused the opposition of certain of the prophets. The latter found their champion in Elijah, whose history reflects the prophetic teaching of more than one age. His denunciation of the royal dynasty, and his emphatic insistence on the worship of Yahweh and Him alone, form the keynote to a period which culminated in the accession of [[Jehu]], an event in which Elijah's chosen disciple [[Elisha]] was the leading figure. 

The allusions to the statutes and works of Omri and Ahab in ''[[Book of Micah|Micah]]'' 6:16 may point to legislative measures of these kings, and the reference to the incidents at the building of [[Jericho]] (''1 Kings'' 16:34) may be taken to show that foundation sacrifices, familiar in nearly all parts of the world, were not unknown in Israel at this period, which have in fact been confirmed by excavation in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

Another '''[[Captain Ahab|Ahab]]''' is the monomanical captain of the [[whaling]] [[ship]] ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]'' in the novel [[Moby-Dick]].

The [[Pacas]] (''Agouti'' genus) are sometimes placed in a separate family ''Agoutidae'' or as the subfamily ''Agoutinae''. 

Note that the animals commonly known as Agoutis are not the same as those with the scientific name ''Agouti''. Adding to the confusion, the name Agoutis is sometimes used to refer to the whole family Dasyproctidae, including or excluding the ''Agouti'' genus.  To avoid misunderstandings, some authors refer to the Pacas as the genus ''Cuniculus''.

'''Algol''' (&amp;beta; Per / [[beta (letter)|Beta]] Persei) is a bright [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]].  It is one of the best known [[eclipsing binary|eclipsing binaries]], the first such star to be discovered, and also one of the first [[variable star]]s in general to be discovered. Algol's [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] changes regularly between 2.3 and 3.5 over a period of 2 days, 20 hours and 49 minutes.

As an eclipsing binary, it is actually two stars in close orbit around one another.  Because the [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] coincidentally matches the [[Earth]]'s line of sight, the dimmer star (Algol B) passes in front of the brighter star (Algol A) once per orbit, and the amount of light reaching Earth is temporarily decreased. To be more precise, however, Algol happens to be a triple star system: the eclipsing binary pair is separated by only 0.062 [[astronomical unit|AU]], while the third star (Algol C) is at an average distance of 2.69 AU from the pair and the mutual [[orbital period]] is 681 days (1.86 years). The total mass of the system is about 5.8 solar masses, and the mass ratios of A, B and C are about 4.5&amp;nbsp;: 1&amp;nbsp;: 2.

The variability of Algol was first recorded in [[1670]] by [[Geminiano Montanari]], but it is probable that this property was noticed long before this time; the name Algol means &quot;demon star,&quot; (from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''&amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1594;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1604;''' ''al-gh&amp;#363;l'', &quot;the [[ghoul]]&quot;) which was probably given due to its peculiar behavior. In the [[constellation]] Perseus, it represents the eye of the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]].

Studies of Algol led to the '''Algol paradox''' in the theory of [[stellar evolution]]: although components of a binary star form at the same time, and massive stars evolve much faster than the less massive ones, it was observed that the more massive component Algol A is still in the [[main sequence]], while the less massive Algol B is a [[subgiant star]] at a later evolutionary stage. The paradox can be solved by [[mass transfer]]: when the more massive star became a subgiant, it filled its [[Roche lobe]], and most of the mass was transferred to the other star, which is still in the main sequence. In some binaries similar to Algol, a gas flow can actually be seen.

Algol is 92.8 [[light year]]s from Earth; however, about 7.3 million years ago it passed within 9.8 light years and its [[apparent magnitude]] was approximately &amp;minus;2.5, considerably brighter than [[Sirius]] is today.  Because the total mass of the system is 5.8 solar masses, and despite the fairly large distance at closest approach, this may have been enough to slightly perturb the [[solar system]]'s [[Oort cloud]] and increase the number of [[comet]]s entering the inner solar system.  However, the actual increase in net cratering rate is believed to have been quite small. [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v117n2/980216/980216.html]

[[Astrology|Astrologically]], Algol is considered the most [[luck|unfortunate]] star in the sky. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was one of the 15 [[Behenian fixed stars|Behenian stars]], associated with the [[diamond]] and [[hellebore]], and marked with the [[kabbalistic]] sign [[Image:Agrippa1531_caputAlgol.png]].

'''&quot;Amazing Grace&quot;''' is one of the most well-known [[Christian]] [[hymn]]s.  The words were written by [[John Newton]]; they form a part of the [[Olney Hymns]] that he worked on, with [[William Cowper]] and other hymnodists.

==History==

John Newton ([[1725]]&amp;ndash;[[1807]]) was the captain of a slave ship. On [[10 May]] [[1748]] returning home during a storm he experienced a &quot;great deliverance&quot;. In his journal he wrote that the ship was in grave danger of sinking. He exclaimed &quot;Lord have mercy upon us&quot;. He came to the light gradually and even continued to trade slaves after his conversion.

Newton wrote the song &quot;How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds&quot; while waiting in an African harbor for a shipment of slaves. Later he renounced his profession, became a minister, and joined William Wilberforce in the fight against slavery.

Newton may have borrowed an old tune sung by the slaves themselves, redeeming the song, just as he had been redeemed.

The now familiar and traditional melody of the hymn was not composed by Newton, and the words were sung to a number of tunes before the now inseparable melody was chanced upon. 

There are two different tunes to the words. &quot;New Britain&quot; first appears in a [[shape note]] hymnal from [[1831]] called ''Virginia Harmony''. Any original words sung to the tune are now lost. The melody is believed to be [[Scotland|Scottish]] or [[Ireland|Irish]] in origin; it is [[pentatonic]] and suggests a [[bagpipe]] tune; the hymn is frequently performed on bagpipes and has become associated with that instrument. The other tune is the so-called &quot;Old Regular Baptist&quot; tune. It was sung by the Congregation of the Little [[Zion]] Church, Jeff, Kentucky on the album &quot;The [[Jean Ritchie|Ritchie]] Family of Kentucky&quot; on Folkways ([[1958]]). 

Newton's lyrics have become a favourite for [[Christianity|Christians]] of all [[religious denomination|denominations]], largely because the hymn vividly and briefly sums up the Christian doctrine of [[Divine grace]]. The lyrics are loosely based around the text of [[Ephesians]] 2:4-8.

It has also become known as a favorite with supporters of freedom and human rights, both Christian and non-Christian, as it is believed by many to be a song against [[slavery]], as Newton was once a slave trader. He continued to be a slave trader for several years after his experience, but with more compassion. Later he became a clergyman. The song has been sung by many notable musical performers. 

The hymn was quite popular among both sides in the [[American Civil War]]. While on the [[trail of tears]], the [[Cherokee]] were not always able to give their dead a full burial.  Instead, the singing of Amazing Grace had to suffice.  Since then, Amazing Grace is often considered the Cherokee National Anthem.  For this reason, many contemporary [[List of Native American musicians|Native American musicians]] have recorded this song.

The name &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was used as the title of a musical written by Mal Pope about the 1904 [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Revival]] and the life of [[Evan Roberts (minister)|Evan Roberts]].

==Bagpipes==

The association with bagpipes is a relatively modern phenomenon; for over a century the tune was nearly forgotten in the British Isles until the folk revival of the [[1960s]] began carrying traditional musicians both ways between the British Isles and the United States (where Amazing Grace had remained a very popular hymn). It was little known outside of church congregations or folk festivals until Arthur Penn's film &quot;[[Alice's Restaurant]]&quot; ([[1969]]). Lee Hays of the Weavers leads the worshipers in &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.

==Lyrics==
:Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)
:That sav'd a wretch like me!
:I once was lost, but now am found,
:Was blind, but now I see.

:'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
:And grace my fears reliev'd;
:How precious did that grace appear,
:The hour I first believ'd!

:Thro' many dangers, toils and snares,
:I have already come;
:'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
:And grace will lead me home.

:The Lord has promis'd good to me,
:His word my hope secures;
:He will my shield and portion be,
:As long as life endures.

:Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
:And mortal life shall cease;
:I shall possess, within the veil,
:A life of joy and peace.

:The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
:The sun forbear to shine;
:But God, who call'd me here below,
:Will be forever mine.

Some versions of the hymn include an additional verse:

:When we've been there ten thousand years,
:Bright shining as the sun,
:We've no less days to sing God's praise
:Than when we'd first begun.

This verse is not by Newton. It was originally from a hymn called ''[[Jerusalem, My Happy Home]]''. It was added to a version of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], as it appears in her [[novel]] ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.  Uncle Tom has pieced the lyrics of several hymns together; those who learned the lyrics from the novel have assumed that it belongs.

Some versions include still another verse:

:Shall I be wafted through the skies,
:on flowery beds of ease,
:where others strive to win the prize,
:and sail through bloody seas.

This verse has been recorded by [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]].
The verse really belongs with the hymn, &quot;Am I a Soldier of the Cross?&quot; by [[Isaac Watts]].

==Recordings==

The hymn has been recorded by countless artists over the last century. Two versions have made the [[UK Singles Chart]]; between 1970 and 1972, a version by [[Judy Collins]] spent 67 weeks in the charts, a record for a female artist, and peaked at number 5. In 1972, an instrumental version by the Pipes and Drums and Military Band of the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]] spent five weeks at number one, also reaching the top spot in Australia. Likewise another artist, [[Hayley Westenra]], released this song on her album [[Pure (album)| Pure]] and this album did incredibly well, selling 19,068 copies in its first week of sales alone.

In addition to recording the hymn, [[Joan Baez]] also opened the US portion of [[Live Aid]], the legendary [[1985]] concert for [[African]] famine relief, with a performance of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.

Folk singer [[Arlo Guthrie]] closes many of his concerts with a version of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; that includes a spoken retelling of its origin.

The composer [[Frank Ticheli]] has written a version of Amazing Grace that is frequently performed by various wind ensembles throughout the United States.

Celtic-influenced [[punk rock|punk]] band the [[Dropkick Murphys]] have made several recordings of Amazing Grace, all of which feature the use of bagpipes.

[[Christian metal]] band [[Stryper]] recorded a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] version of Amazing Grace, titled ''10,000 years'', which came out in their album 2005 album [[Reborn (album)|Reborn]]

[[Chris Squire]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]] also has recorded a bass solo version of Amazing Grace on the Rhino's rerelease of '[[Going For The One]]' album.

Another version was used as the ending song for the Japanese drama series Shiroi Kyoto(2003-2004 version).

'''America Online''', or '''AOL''' for short, is a U.S.-based [[online service provider]], [[Internet service provider]], and media company operated by [[Time Warner]]. Based in [[Dulles, Virginia|Dulles]], [[Virginia]], a community in [[Loudoun County, Virginia]], with regional branches around the world, it is by far the most successful proprietary online service, with more than 32 million subscribers at one point in the [[United States of America|US]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Latin America]] (declared bankrupt in 2004), [[Japan]] and formerly [[Russia]]. In early 2005, AOL [[Hong Kong]] stopped its service.  In the fall of 2004, AOL reported total subscribers had dropped to 24 million, a drop of over a quarter of its subscribers.[http://isp-planet.com/research/rankings/2003/usa_insight_q32003.html] In late 1996, AOL suspended all dialup service within [[Russia]] in the face of massive billing [[fraud]], forcing the company into a rare case of full market retreat.

For many Americans through the mid to late [[1990s]], AOL ''was'' the Internet, but the rise of high-speed Internet access from cable and telephone companies as well as the increasing sophistication of the public in handling browsers and other Internet utilities has cut into its user base.  In 2000 AOL and [[Time Warner]] announced plans to merge, and the deal was approved by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] on [[January 11]] [[2001]]. This merger was primarily a product of the Internet mania of the late 1990's, known as the [[Internet bubble]]. The subsequent massive decline in value of stocks such as AOL resulted in much recrimination over the merger. Also, the merger with AOL allowed for Time Warner to vote off WCW ( World Championship Wrestling ). 

News reports in the fall of 2005 indicated a renewed interest in buying out AOL. Suitors such as [[Microsoft]], [[Google]], [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]] and [[Comcast]] have had discussions with [[Time Warner]] about a possible purchase, and on [[December 16]], [[2005]], Time Warner and Google announced that they were starting exclusive talks for Google to purchase $1 billion in AOL stock, a 5% share.

Although its dialup market is shrinking as more members switch to high-speed services, the success of its AOL for Broadband program has helped it to maintain members that would otherwise totally drop the AOL service.  This combined with its growing advertising revenue through its relationship with Google, AOL collected 8.7 billion US dollars in revenue for 2004.

==History==
[[Image:AOL.gif|thumbnail|The AOL logo used until late 2004|150 px|right]]
AOL began as a short-lived venture called Control Video Corporation (or CVC), founded by [[William von Meister]]. Its sole product was an online service called [[Gameline]] for the [[Atari 2600]] [[video game console]] after von Meister's idea of buying music on demand was rejected by [[Warner Brothers]]. (Klein, 2003) Subscribers bought a [[modem]] from the company for $49.95 and paid a one-time $15 setup fee. Gameline permitted subscribers to temporarily download games and keep track of high scores, at a cost of approximately $1 an hour.

In 1983 the company nearly went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]], and an investor in Control Video, [[Frank Caufield]], had a friend of his, [[Jim Kimsey]], brought in as a manufacturing consultant.  That same year, [[Steve Case]] was hired as a part-time consultant; later on that year, he joined the company as a full-time marketing employee upon the joint recommendations of von Meister and Kimsey. Kimsey went on to become the [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) of the newly-renamed Quantum Computer Services in 1985 after von Meister was quietly dropped from the company.

Case himself rose quickly through the ranks; Kimsey promoted him to vice-president of marketing not long after becoming CEO, and later promoted him further to executive vice-president in 1987. Kimsey soon began to groom Case to ascend to the rank of CEO when he himself retired, which Case did in 1991.

Kimsey changed the company's strategy, and in 1985 launched a sort of mega-[[Bulletin board system|BBS]] for [[Commodore 64]] and [[Commodore 128|128]] computers, originally called [[Quantum Link]] (&quot;Q-Link&quot; for short). In May [[1988]], Quantum and Apple launched [[AppleLink]] Personal Edition for [[Apple II family|Apple II]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers. After the two companies parted ways in October [[1989]], Quantum changed the service's name to America Online. [http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1989.htm], [http://apple2history.org/history/ah22.html] &lt;!--both links retrieved Sep 24 2005--&gt; In August [[1988]], Quantum launched [[PC Link]], a service for IBM-compatible [[personal computer|PC]]s developed in a joint venture with the [[Tandy Corporation]].

In February 1991 AOL for [[DOS]] was launched using a [[GeoWorks]] interface followed a year later by AOL for Windows. In October [[1991]], Quantum changed its name to America Online. These changes coincided with growth in pay-based BBS services, like [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], [[CompuServe]], and [[GEnie]]. AOL discontinued Q-Link and PC Link in the fall of 1994.

== Massive growth ==
Case drove AOL as the online service for people unfamiliar with [[computer|computers]], in particular contrast to [[CompuServe]], which had long served the technical community. AOL was the first online service to require use of [[proprietary]] software, rather than a standard terminal program; as a result it was able to offer a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) instead of command lines, and was well ahead of the competition in emphasizing communication among members as a feature. 

In particular was the Chat Room (borrowed from IRC), which allowed a large group of people with similar interests to convene and hold conversations in real time, including:
*Private rooms &amp;mdash; created by any user.  Hold up to 27 people.
*Conference rooms &amp;mdash; created with permission of AOL.  Hold up to 48 people and often moderated. 
*Auditoriums &amp;mdash; created with permission of AOL.  Consisted of a stage and an unlimited number of rows.  What happened on the stage was viewable by everybody in the auditorium but what happened within individual rows, of up to 27 people, was viewable only by the people within those rows.
There were also text games played in the chat rooms, known as [[AOL chatroom game]].

Under Case's guidance, AOL committed to including [[online games]] in its mix of products even when it was only a Commodore 64 service.  It hosted the first [[Play-by-mail game|Play by email]] game from any service ''[[Quantum Space]]'' (1989-1991); the first graphical online community (''[[Habitat (video game)|Club Caribe]]'' from [[LucasArts]]); and the first graphical [[MMORPG]], ''[[Neverwinter Nights#History|Neverwinter Nights]]'' from [[Stormfront Studios]] (1991-1997) and the first chatroom-based text role-playing game Black Bayou, a horror role-playing game from Hecklers Online and [[ANTAGONIST, Inc.]]

AOL quickly surpassed [[GEnie]], and by the mid-[[1990s]], it passed [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]] (which for several years allowed AOL advertising) and [[CompuServe]].

Originally, AOL charged its users an hourly fee, but in 1996 this changed and a flat rate of $19.99 a month was charged. Within three years, AOL's userbase would grow to 10 million people. During this time, AOL connections would be flooded with users trying to get on, and many canceled their accounts due to constant busy signals. Also, games which used to be paid for with the hourly fee migrated in droves to the internet.

AOL was relatively late in providing access to the open Internet.  Originally, only some Internet features were accessible through a proprietary interface but eventually it became possible to run other Internet software while logged in through AOL.  They were the first online service to seamlessly integrate a web browser into content.

AOL introduced the concept of [[Buddy List]]s, leveraging their one-on-one [[instant messaging]] technology.

Since its merger with Time Warner, the value of AOL has dropped from its $200 billion high and it has seen a similar losses among its subscription rate. It has since attempted to reposition itself as a content provider similar to companies such as Yahoo! as opposed to an Internet service provider which delivered content only to subscribers in what was termed a &quot;walled garden.&quot;. In 2005, AOL broadcast the [[Live 8]] concert live over the Internet, and thousands of users downloaded clips of the concert over the following months. 

More recently, AOL has announced plans to offer subscribers classic television programs for free with commercials inserted.  Programs available include [[Wonder Woman (television series)|Wonder Woman]] and [[Eight is Enough]].

One of AOL's recently added premium services is AOL Total Talk, a VoiP Internet service.

== CD-ROM distribution ==
{{seealso|AOL disk collecting}}
AOL has tirelessly pushed itself through regularly mailing sign-up [[diskette]]s and [[CD-ROM]]s to over 100 million households, helping forge dominant growth. This campaign has been made particuarly effective by the way of these CDs offer free trials. In the early years of AOL's practice of offering free trials with CDs, the trials were usually only a few hours. The trial time has gradually increased, and now the CDs tend to offer a month's free trial.

However this long campaign has produced a backlash, including a program called [[No More AOL CDs]] that seeks to gather one million unwanted AOL CDs and dump them at AOL headquarters.  Other organizations have objected under both [[environmental]] and [[privacy]] grounds.  Environmentalists say that AOL's CDs are largely unwanted and result in massive non-biodegradable plastic waste.  However, AOL's mailings have never violated the law, and always interest some people.  AOL has also always provided means for people to remove themselves from AOL mailing lists, though No More AOL CDs has documented claims that these removal attempts are sometimes ineffective.  Others view [[AOL disk collecting|AOL disks]] as valuable [[collecting|collectible]] items due to the vast number of [[CD-ROM]] design variations.

== AOL users' reputation ==
People using AOL (often referred to as &quot;AOLers&quot;) have a reputation online for being excessively  [[Newbie|noobish]]&amp;mdash;ignorant of [[netiquette]]. This is in part due to the fact that AOL is aimed towards users who are new to the Internet. To a segment of the online population, an e-mail address ending in ''aol.com'' is a sign of ignorance, to be avoided at all costs.  Some web, game, and chat servers even go as far as to ban the AOL hostmask, preventing AOL users from logging on. Additionally, the EFNET [[IRC]] chat network banned all AOL users for a time.  However, this reputation doesn't stop ''aol.com'' addresses from being widely used, even in serious business contexts; it is still commonplace in advertisements in non-computer-related publications to see lines like &quot;See our website at '''www.whatever.com''', or e-mail us at '''whatever@aol.com,'''&quot; to the puzzlement of those who believe an address in the company's own domain would be more logical and professional. 

AOL further provoked disdain from other Internet users in 1994, when AOL began to provide access to the [[Usenet]] bulletin board system for its users. This led to a flood of relatively net-illiterate, commercial, young and immature users into what had previously been the almost exclusive domain of scientists, academics and technical personnel associated with universities and computer companies. The new AOL contingent immediately gained a reputation as pests in Usenet's numerous forums, making near-constant requests for pornography, bootlegged software and hacking information. (See: &quot;[[Me too]].&quot;)  In early [[2005]], AOL ceased providing newsgroup access, instead referring customers to the [[Google Groups]] site, stating &quot;Google does a very good job of hosting newsgroups and the typical AOL user probably doesn't use newsgroups that often.&quot;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/25/aol_cutsoff_newsgroups/]

AOL e-mail accounts used to be only accessed using a nonstandard proprietary protocol not supported by other vendors' e-mail programs, compelling users, in the past, to use AOL's own mail program and be subject to its quirks and limitations. [[Claris Em@iler]] was the only third-party email software ever licenced to directly access AOL email until the recent opening of AOL to [[IMAP]] email access. One consequence of the past practice is that when people receive e-mails from AOL users, the address, not the name of the user, is displayed, since the user's real name is not added in the manner that most other mail programs do it. In instances where the AOL user has chosen an alphanumeric alias, eg: &quot;'''jwds75@aol.com'''&quot; rather than &quot;'''John Smith'''&quot;, the identity of the user is less clear to the recipient. Also in the past, users of the AOL client software were unable to click on hyperlinks in the text.  Many experienced Internet users remain unaware that these inherent limitations of the AOL software are not due to any possible lack of computer skills by AOL users.

In a different vein, AOL users also have a reputation in some online communities for disruptive activities. AOL makes use of aggressive [[web cache|web caching]] [[proxy server]]s that effectively makes it impossible for a website, such as a [[wiki]], to block an abusive user without excluding large segments of the entire AOL community. Combined with the fact that their free service offers make it all too easy to join, many [[Internet troll]]s take advantage of this and choose AOL as a preferred means of hiding their true identity, in a manner that is almost as effective as using an [[anonymous proxy]].  This has only served to further harm the reputation of AOL users as a whole and is a large part of why some places implement a policy of banning all AOL users.

==Controversies==
===Community Leaders===
Prior to the middle of 2005, AOL used volunteers called [[America Online Community Leaders Program|Community Leaders]], or CLs, to monitor chatrooms, message boards, and libraries. Some community leaders were recruited for content design and maintenance using a proprietary language and interface called [[RAINMAN]], although most content maintenance was performed by partner and internal employees. 

In 1999, Kelly Hallissey and Brian Williams, former Community Leaders and founders of an anti-AOL website  filed a [[class action lawsuit]] against AOL citing violations of U.S. labor laws in its usage of CLs. The [[Department of Labor]] investigated but came to no conclusions, closing their investigation in 2001.  In light of these events, AOL drastically began reducing the responsibilities and privileges of its volunteers in 2000.  The program was eventually ended on [[June 8]] [[2005]].  Current Community Leaders at the time were offered 12 months of credit on their accounts. Also for a time AOL had a bot named CATWATCH which would pop into user created private rooms where TOS violations MAY be occuring, and everyone in the room would be disconnected from AOL and get a TOS strike against their account.

===Billing disputes===
AOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing people after their accounts have been cancelled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit. Previously, AOL would add fifteen seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 11 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 13 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the lawsuit won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged for.

===Account cancellation===
In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, New York Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]]âs office began an inquiry of AOLâs customer service policies. The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate system for rewarding employees who purported to retain or &quot;save&quot; subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribersâ wishes, or without their consent.

Under the system, consumer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or &quot;save&quot; half of the people who called to cancel service. For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or &quot;save&quot; percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum &quot;save&quot; rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.

Many consumers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing.

On August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25 million to the state of New York and reformed its 
customer service procedures.  Under the agreement, AOL will no longer require its customer 
service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus.

===Software===
In 2000, AOL was served with an $8 billion lawsuit alleging that its (now dated) AOL 5.0 software caused significant difficulties for users attempting to use third-party Internet service providers. The lawsuit sought damages of up to $1000 for each user that had downloaded the software cited at the time of the lawsuit. AOL later agreed to a settlement of $15 million, without admission of wrongdoing. 

=== Usenet newsgroups ===
When AOL gave clients access to [[Usenet]] in 1994, they hid at least one newsgroup in standard list view: ''alt.aol-sucks''.  AOL did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view, but changed the description to &quot;Flames and complaints about America Online&quot;.

=== Terms of Service (TOS) ===
There have been many complaints over rules that govern AOL's members conduct, call the Terms Of Service, which apply/applied to everyone who used AOL, regardless of age, or where an AOL member is on the internet. Claims are that these rules are too strict to follow, do not allow swearing, or a very flexible rule called room disruption.

== Company purchases ==
As it grew, AOL purchased many other software companies, including: 

*[[BookLink]] bought in December 1994.  
*[[NaviSoft]]'s [[NaviServer]] (later to become [[AOLserver]]) in 1994.

:''This article is about the branch of mathematics. For other uses of the term see [[algebra (disambiguation)]].''

'''Algebra''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: Ø§ÙØ¬Ø¨Ø±, ''al-jabr'') is a branch of [[mathematics]] which studies [[structure]] and [[quantity]]. [[Elementary algebra]] is often taught in high school and gives an introduction into the basic ideas of algebra: studying what happens when one adds and multiplies numbers and how one can make [[polynomial]]s and find their roots. 

Algebra is much broader than [[arithmetic]] and can be generalized. Rather than working on numbers, one can work over [[symbols]] or [[element (mathematics)|elements]]. Addition and multiplication are viewed as general [[operator|operations]], and their precise definitions lead to structures called [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. 

Together with [[geometry]] and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], algebra is one of the three main branches of mathematics. 

==Classification==
Algebra may be roughly divided into the following categories:
* '''[[elementary algebra]]''', in which the properties of operations on the [[real number|real number system]] are recorded using symbols as &quot;place holders&quot; to denote [[mathematical constant|constants]] and [[variable]]s, and the rules governing [[mathematical expression]]s and [[equation]]s involving these symbols are studied (note that this usually includes the subject matter of courses called ''intermediate algebra'' and ''college algebra'');
* '''[[abstract algebra]]''', sometimes also called ''modern algebra'', in which [[algebraic structure]]s such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|field]]s are [[axiomatization|axiomatically]] defined and investigated;
* '''[[linear algebra]]''', in which the specific properties of [[vector space]]s are studied (including [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]);
* '''[[universal algebra]]''', in which properties common to all algebraic structures are studied.

In advanced studies, axiomatic algebraic systems like groups, rings, fields, and algebras over a field are investigated in the presence of a natural [[geometry|geometric]] structure (a [[topology]]) which is compatible with the algebraic structure. The list includes: 

* [[Normed linear space]]s
* [[Banach space]]s 
* [[Hilbert space]]s
* [[Banach algebra]]s
* [[Normed algebra]]s
* [[Topological algebra]]s
* [[Topological group]]s

==Elementary algebra==

'''Elementary algebra''' is the most basic form of [[algebra]] taught to students who are presumed to have no knowledge of [[mathematics]] beyond the basic principles of [[arithmetic]]. While in arithmetic only [[number]]s and their arithmetical operations (such as +, &amp;minus;, &amp;times;, Ã·) occur, in algebra one also uses symbols (such as ''a'', ''x'', ''y'') to denote numbers. This is useful because:
* It allows the general formulation of arithmetical laws (such as &lt;math&gt;a + b = b + a&lt;/math&gt; for all ''a'' and ''b''), and thus is the first step to a systematic exploration of the properties of the [[real number|real number system]].
* It allows the reference to &quot;unknown&quot; numbers, the formulation of [[equation]]s and the study of how to solve these (for instance &quot;find a number ''x'' such that &lt;math&gt;3x + 1 = 10&lt;/math&gt;).
* It allows the formulation of [[function (mathematics)|function]]al relationships (such as &quot;if you sell ''x'' tickets, then your profit will be &lt;math&gt;3x - 10&lt;/math&gt; dollars&quot;).

==Abstract algebra==
:''Main article: [[Abstract algebra]]; see also [[algebraic structures]]''.
'''Abstract algebra''' extends the familiar concepts found in elementary algebra and [[arithmetic]] of [[numbers]] to more general concepts.

'''[[Set]]s''': Rather than just considering the different types of [[number]]s, abstract algebra deals with the more general concept of ''sets'': a collection of objects called [[elements]]. All the familiar types of numbers are sets. Other examples of sets include the set of all two by two [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], the set of all second degree [[polynomials]] (''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''bx''+''c''), the set of all two dimensional [[vectors]] in the plane, and the various [[finite groups]] such as the [[cyclic group]]s which are the group of integers modulo ''n''. [[Set theory]] is a branch of [[logic]] and not technically a branch of algebra.

'''[[Binary operation]]s''': The notion of [[addition]] (+) is abstracted to give a ''binary operation'', * say. For two elements ''a'' and ''b'' in a set ''S'' ''a''*''b'' gives another element in the set, (technically this condition is called [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]]). [[Addition]] (+), [[subtraction]] (-), [[multiplication]] (&amp;times;), and [[division]] (&amp;divide;) are all binary operations as in addition and multiplication of matrices, vectors, and polynomials.

'''[[Identity element]]s''': Zero and one are abstracted to give the notion of an ''identity element''. Zero is the identity element for addition and one is the identity element for multiplication. For a general binary operator * the identity element ''e'' must satisfy ''a''*''e''=''a'' and ''e''*''a''=''a''. This holds for addition as ''a''+0=''a'', and 0+''a''=''a'' and multiplication ''a''&amp;times;''1''=''a'', 1&amp;times;''a''=''a''. However, if we take the positive natural numbers and addition, there is no identity element.

'''[[Inverse elements]]''': The negative numbers gives rise to the concept of an ''inverse elements''. For addition the inverse of ''a'' is ''-a'', and for multiplication the inverse is &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;. A general inverse element ''a''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; must satisfy the property that ''a''*''a''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=''e'' and ''a''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;*''a''=''e''.

'''[[Associativity]]''': The integers with addition have a property called associativity: (2+3)+4=2+(3+4). In general this becomes (''a''+''b'')+''c''=''a''+(''b''+''c''). This property is shared by most binary operations, but not subtraction or division.

'''[[Commutative operation|Commutativity]]''': The integers with addition also have a property called commutativity: 2+3=3+2. In general this becomes ''a''+''b''=''b''+''a''. Only some binary operations have this property, it holds for the integers with addition and multiplication, but it does not hold for [[matrix multiplication]].

===Groups===
:''Main article: [[group (mathematics)|group]]; see also [[group theory]], [[examples of groups]]''
Combining the above concepts gives one of the most important structures in mathematics: a '''[[group (mathematics)|group]]'''. A group consists of:
*a set ''S'' of elements,
*a(closed) binary operation (*)
*an identity element exists,
*every element has an inverse,
*the operation is associative.

If commutativity is included as well then we obtain an [[Abelian group]].

For example, the set of integers under the operation of addition is a group.  In this group, the identity element is 0 and the inverse of any element ''a'' is its negation, -''a''.  The associativity requirement is met since for any integers ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', &lt;math&gt;(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)&lt;/math&gt;.

The non-zero [[rational number]]s form a group under multiplication.  Here, the identity element is 1, since &lt;math&gt;1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a&lt;/math&gt; for any any rational number ''a''.  The inverse of ''a'' is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{a}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;a \cdot {1 \over a}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

The integers under the multiplication operation, however, do not form a group.  This is because, in general, the multiplicative inverse of an integer is not an integer.  For example, 4 is an integer, but its multiplicative inverse is &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which is not an integer.

The theory of groups is studied in [[group theory]]. A major result in this theory is the [[Classification of finite simple groups]] a vast body of work which classified all the is a vast body of work, mostly published between around [[1955]] and [[1983]], which is thought to classify all of the [[finite set|finite]] [[simple group]]s.

Many other types of algebraic structures exist.  Among the most common are [[Ring_(mathematics)|rings]], [[Field_(mathematics)|fields]], and [[Monoid|monoids]].  These different structures can be used to model different types of mathematical objects.  Different algebraic structures are often related.  For example, a group is a specific kind of monoid, and rings and fields are similar to groups, but with more operations.

== Algebras ==
The word '''''algebra''''' is also used for various [[algebraic structures]]:
* [[algebra over a field]]
* [[algebra over a set]]
* [[Boolean algebra]]
* [[sigma-algebra]]
* [[F-algebra]] and [[F-coalgebra]] in [[category theory]]

==History==
[[Image:Euklid2.jpg|thumb|175px|Hellenistic mathematician [[Euclid]] details [[geometric]]al algebra in ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.]]

The origins of algebra can be traced to the ancient [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptians]] and [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]], who used an early type of algebra to solve [[linear equation|linear]], [[quadratic equation|quadratic]], and [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] equations more than 3,000 years ago. By contrast, most [[Indian mathematics|Indian]] and [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematicians in the [[1st millennium BC]] usually solved such equations by [[geometry|geometric]] methods.

*Circa [[100 BC]]: [[Algebraic equations]] are treated in the [[Chinese mathematics]] book ''[[Jiuzhang suanshu]]'' (''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'').
*Circa [[100 BC]]: The ''[[Indian mathematics#Bakhshali Manuscript .28200_BC - 400 CE.29|Bakhshali Manuscript]]'' in [[ancient India]] contains algebraic solutions of [[linear equations]] with upto five unknowns, the general algebraic formula for the quadratic equation, quadratic indeterminate equations, and [[simultaneous equations]].
*Circa [[150|150 AD]]: [[Hellenized]] [[Egyptian]] mathematician [[Hero of Alexandria]], treats algebraic equations in three volumes of mathematics.
*Circa [[200]]: Hellenized [[Babylonian]] mathematician [[Diophantus]], who lived in Egypt and is often considered as the &quot;father of algebra&quot;, writes his famous ''[[Arithmetica]]'', a work featuring solutions of algebraic equations and on the theory of numbers.
*[[499]]: Indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]], obtains whole number solutions to linear equations by a method equivalent to the modern one.
*[[628]]: Indian mathematician [[Brahmagupta]], invents the method of solving indeterminate equations of the second degree, gives rules for solving linear and quadratic equations, and discovers negative solutions for the [[quadratic equation]]. [[Indian mathematicians]] at the time recognized that [[quadratic equation]]s have two [[root]]s, and included [[Negative and non-negative numbers|negative]] as well as [[irrational number|irrational]] roots.
*[[820]]: The word ''algebra'' is derived from operations described in the treatise first written by [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]] [[Al-Khwarizmi]] titled: ''[[Al-Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah]]'' meaning ''The book of summary concerning calculating by transposition and reduction''. The word ''al-jabr'' means  ''&quot;reunion&quot;''. Al-Khwarizmi is often considered as the &quot;father of modern algebra&quot;, much of whose works on reduction was included in the book and added to many methods we have in algebra now.
*Circa [[1000]]: [[Abu Bakr al-Karaji]], in his treatise ''al-Fakhri'', extends Al-Khwarizmi's methodology to incorporate integral powers and integral roots of unknown quantities.
*[[1114]]: Indian mathematician [[Bhaskara II]], who wrote the text ''Bijaganita'' (''Algebra''), recognizes that a positive number has two [[square root]]s, and also solves quadratic indeterminate equations and quadratic equations with more than one unknown.
*[[1202]]: Algebra is introduced to [[Europe]] largely through the work of [[Leonardo Fibonacci]] of [[Pisa]] in his work ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' .

'''Anno Domini''' (&quot;In the Year of the Lord&quot;), abbreviated as '''AD''' or '''A.D.''' defines an [[epoch]] based on the traditionally-reckoned year of the birth (or actually [[Incarnation#Christianity|Incarnation]]) of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]].

This is the designation used to number years in the '''Christian Era''', conventionally used with the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s. &lt;br&gt; &quot;Before Christ&quot;, abbreviated as '''BC''' or '''B.C.''' is now usually used to denote years before Anno Domini years in [[English language]]. &lt;br&gt; More extensive, the years may be also designed by ''Anno Domini Nostri Iesu Christi,'' in English translation from [[Latin]]: &quot;In the Year of Our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. 

This Christian era is currently dominant all around the world in both commercial and scientific use. &lt;br&gt; Presently, it is the common, international standard, recognised by international institutions such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Universal Postal Union]]. &lt;br&gt; This is due both to the [[tradition]] and to the fact that the solar [[Gregorian calendar]] has long time been considered to be astronomically correct.{{Ref|gregorian}}

The English usage adheres to the traditional practice of placing the abbreviation before the year, as in Latin (e.g., 64 BC, but AD 2001).

[[image:scriptorium.jpg|frame|[[Dionysius Exiguus]] invented ''Anno Domini'' years to [[computus|date Easter]].]]

== Synonyms ==
=== Common Era ===
Anno Domini is sometimes referred to as the [[Common Era]] (''CE'') instead. This term is often preferred by those who want to avoid the association with the Christian era. For example, Cunningham and Starr (1998) write that &quot;B.C.E./C.E. ... do not presuppose faith in Christ and hence are more appropriate for interfaith dialog than the conventional B.C./A.D.&quot; When the [[People's Republic of China]] abolished the [[Republic of China]] era in [[1949]], it adopted Western years, calling that era ''gÅngyuÃ¡n'', å¬å, which literally means Common Era.

=== Anno Salutis ===
Anno Salutis (often translated from [[Latin]] as ''in the year of salvation'') is a dating style used up until the eighteenth century, which like Anno Domini dates years from the birth of [[Christ]]. It can be explained in the context of Christian belief, where the birth of Jesus saved mankind from [[eternal damnation]]. It is often used in a more elaborate form such as Anno Nostrae Salutis (''in the year of our salvation''), Anno Salutis Humanae (''in the year of human well-being''), Anno Reparatae Salutis (''in the year of accomplished salvation'').

== Numbering of years ==
Historians do not use a [[year zero]] â AD 1 is the first year or epoch of the Anno Domini era, and 1 BC immediately precedes it as the first year before the epoch. This is a problem with some calculations; so in [[astronomical year numbering]] a zero is added, and the 'AD' and 'BC' are dropped. In keeping with 'standard decimal numbering', a negative sign 'â' is added for earlier years, so counting down from year 2 would give 2, 1, 0, â1, â2, and so on. This results in a one-year shift between the two systems (eg â1 equals 2 BC). This article, however, is about the civil usage without a year zero.

== Earlier calendar epochs ==
''Anno Domini'' dating was not adopted in Western Europe until the eighth century. Like the other inhabitants of the [[Roman Empire]], early Christians used one of several methods to indicate a specific year â and it was not uncommon for more than one to be used in the same document. This redundancy allows historians to construct parallel regnal lists for many kingdoms and polities by comparing chronicles from different regions, which include the same rulers.

===Consular dating===
The earliest and most common practice was Roman '[[consul]]ar' dating. This involved naming both ''consulares ordinares'' who had been appointed to this office on [[January 1]] of the civil year. Sometimes one or both consuls might not be appointed until November or December of the previous year, and news of the appointment may not have reached parts of the Roman empire for several months into the current year; thus we find the occasional inscription where the year is defined as &quot;after the consulate&quot; of a pair of consuls.

===Dating from the founding of Rome===
Another method of dating, rarely used, was to indicate the year ''[[ab urbe condita]]'', or &quot;from the foundation of the City&quot; (abbreviated AUC), where &quot;the City&quot; meant [[Rome]]. Several epochs were in use by Roman historians. Modern historians usually adopt the epoch of [[Varro]], which we place in 753 BC.

About AD 400 the Iberian historian [[Orosius]] used the ''ab urbe condita'' era.  Pope [[Boniface IV]] (about AD 600) may have been the first to use both the ''ab urbe condita'' era and the ''Anno Domini'' era (he put AD 607 = AUC 1360).

===Regnal years of Roman emperors===
Another system that is less commonly found than thought was to use the [[regnal year]] of the [[Roman emperor]]. At first, [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] would indicate the year of his rule by counting how many times he had held the office of consul, and how many times the [[Roman Senate]] had granted him [[Tribune|Tribunican]] powers, carefully observing the fiction that his powers came from these offices granted to him, rather than from his own person or the many [[legion]]s under his control. His successors followed his practice until the memory of the [[Roman Republic]] faded (late in the second century or early in the third century), when they openly began to use their regnal year.

===Indiction cycles===
Another common system was to use the [[indiction]] cycle (15 indictions made up an agricultural tax cycle, an indiction being a year in duration). Documents and events began to be dated by the year of the cycle (e.g., &quot;fifth indiction&quot;, &quot;tenth indiction&quot;) in the fourth century, and was used long after the tax was no longer collected. This system was used in [[Gaul]], in [[Egypt]] until the [[History of early Arab Egypt | Islamic conquest]], and in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] until its conquest in [[1453]].

===Other dating systems===
A great many local systems or [[era]]s were also important, for example the year from the foundation of one particular city, the regnal year of the neighboring [[History of Persia | Persian emperor]], and eventually even the year of the reigning [[Caliph]]. The beginning of the numbered year also varied from place to place, and was not largely standardized in [[Europe]] (except [[England]]) as [[January 1]] until the sixteenth century. The most important of these include the [[Seleucid era]] (in use until the eighth century), and the [[Spanish era]] (in use in official documents in [[Aragon]], [[Valencia]], and in [[Castile]], into the fourteenth century. In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last country of [[western Europe]] to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' era).

== History of ''Anno Domini'' ==
Early Christians designated the year via a combination of consular dating, imperial regnal year dating, and Creation dating. Use of consular dating ended when the emperor [[Justinian I]] discontinued appointing consuls in the mid sixth century, shortly after he required that the use of imperial regnal dating. The last consul nominated was [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius]] in 541. The [[papacy]] was in regular contact throughout the [[Middle Ages]] with envoys of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] world, and had a clear idea â sudden deaths and deposals notwithstanding â of who was the [[Byzantine emperor]] at any one time.

The ''Anno Domini'' system was developed by a [[Scythia]]n monk named [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in Rome in 525, as an outcome of his work on calculating the [[computus|date of Easter]].  Byzantine chroniclers like [[Theophanes]] continued to date each year in their world chronicles on a different Judaeo-Christian basis â from the notional [[Creation (theology)|creation]] of the World as calculated by Christian scholars in the first five centuries of the Christian era.  These eras, sometimes called ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', &quot;year of the world&quot; (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, had their own disagreements.  No single Anno Mundi epoch was dominant. One popular formulation was that established by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], a historian at the time of [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine I]].  The [[Latin]] translator [[Jerome]] helped popularize Eusebius's AM count in the West. Another formulation, dominant in the East during the early centuries of the Byzantine Empire, was developed by the [[Alexandria]]n monk [[Anninus of Alexandria|Anninus]].

=== Accuracy===
Almost all [[Biblical]] scholars believe that Dionysius was incorrect in his calculation, and that the date claimed for Jesus' birth was between 8 BC and 4 BC. The birth of Christ is known to have preceded the death of [[Herod the Great]] which occurred in 4 BC according to [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]].

=== Popularization  ===
The first historian or chronicler to use Anno Domini as his primary dating mechanism was [[Victor of Tonnenna]], an African chronicler of the seventh century. A few generations later, the [[Anglo-Saxon]] historian [[Bede]], who was familiar with the work of Dionysius, also used Anno Domini dating in his ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People,'' finished in 731. In this same history, he was the first to use the Latin equivalent of ''before Christ'' and established the standard for historians of no [[year zero]], even though he used zero in his [[computus]]. Both Dionysius and Bede regarded Anno Domini as beginning at the incarnation, or conception, of Jesus, not his birth approximately nine months later (''[[Annunciation]] style''). 

On the continent of [[Europe]], Anno Domini was introduced as the era of choice of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] by [[Alcuin]]. This endorsement by [[Charlemagne]] and [[List of Frankish Kings | his successors]] popularizing the usage of the epoch and spreading it throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]] ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence until present times.

Outside the Carolingian Empire, Spain continued to date by the [[Era of the Caesars]], or [[Spanish Era]], well into the Middle Ages, which counted beginning with 38 BC. The [[Era of Martyrs]], which numbered years from the accession of [[Diocletian]] in [[284]], who launched the last yet most severe persecution of Christians, prevailed in the East and is still used officially by the [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic]] and used to be used by the [[Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] church. Another system was to date from the [[crucifixion]] of Jesus Christ, which as early as [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Tertullian]] was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the Gemini (AD 29), which appears in the occasional medieval manuscript.

Even though Anno Domini was in widespread use by the ninth century, Before Christ (or its equivalent) did not become widespread until the late fifteenth century.

== Other eras in official use  ==
Some other eras were in official use in [[Modern Europe|modern times]] or are still in use in several countries alongside the current international Anno Domini era.
=== European attempts ===
* The [[French Revolution]] seriously attempted to displace the Anno Domini system by instead dating from 22 September 1792 = 1 vendÃ©miaire an I (''an'' means year in [[French language|French]]) of the [[First French Republic]]. (''see'' [[French Revolutionary Calendar]]). NapolÃ©on finally abolished the calendar effective [[1 January]] [[1806]], the day after 10 nivÃ´se an XIV.
* The [[Fascism|Italian Fascists]] used the standard system along with [[Roman numerals]] to denote the number of years since the establishment of the Fascist government in [[1922]]. Therefore, 1934, for example, was Year XII. This era was abolished with the fall of fascism in Italy on [[July 25]], [[1943]]. &lt;br&gt; ''Both attempts ultimately failed to replace the standard calendar.''

=== Asian national eras ===
* The official [[Japanese era name|Japanese system]] numbers years from the accession of the current [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]], regarding the calendar year during which the accession occurred as the first year.
* It is still very common in [[Taiwan]] to date events via the [[Republic of China]] era, whose first year is [[1912]].
* [[North Korea]] uses a system that starts in 1912 (= [[Juche]] 1), the year of the birth of their founder [[Kim Il-Sung]]. The year 2004 was &quot;Juche 93&quot;. ''Juche'' means ''&quot;[[autarchy]], self-reliance&quot;''.
* In [[Thailand]] in 1888 King [[Chulalongkorn]] decreed a National Thai Era since founding of [[Bangkok]] on 1782, April 6. In 1912 the New Year's Day was shifted to April 1. In [[1941]], the Prime Ministre [[Phibunsongkhram]] decided to count the years since B.C. 543. This is the so-called [[Thai solar calendar]] or Thailand Buddhist Era clearly relied on the western solar calendar. This is one of the versions of the [[Buddhist calendar]].

=== Religious eras ===
* In [[Israel]], the traditional [[Hebrew calendar]], using an era [[Anno mundi|dating from Creation]], is in official use.
* In the [[Islam]]ic world, traditional [[Islamic calendar|Islamic dating]] according to the ''Anno HegirÃ¦'' (in the year of the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]'') era remains in use to a varying extent, especially for religious purposes.

== Note ==
* {{note|gregorian}} [1] The mean year of the Gregorian calendar is 365.2425 days. This approximated the mean tropical year more than five millennia ago. The real (mean) [[tropical year]] is now very close to 365.2421875 days i.e. 27s/year shorter. However, relative to the [[vernal equinox]] year, important for the determination of the date of Christian [[Easter]], the older [[Aloysius Lilius|Lilius]] definition of the year is and will be a very good value. The ''vernal equinox year'' and the ''mean tropical year'' have falsely been seen as identical even by many erudite persons of the 20th century.
* The approximation of the year in the old [[Persian calendar]] attributed to [[Omar KhayyÃ¡m]] is 365.24&lt;font style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;24&lt;/font&gt; days, which is very close to the vernal equinox year, but requires a 33-year cycle.
* The definition of [[Milutin MilankoviÄ]], used in the &quot;[[revised Julian calendar]]&quot;, is 365.24&lt;font style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;22&lt;/font&gt; days, which is very close to the mean tropical year, but uses unequal long-period cycles.
