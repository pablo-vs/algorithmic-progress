'''Ara''' ([[Latin]] for ''[[Altar]]'') is a faint southerly [[constellation]] between the constellations [[Telescopium]] and [[Norma (constellation)|Norma]].

== Notable features ==
Ara's brightest star, [[Beta Arae|&amp;beta; Arae]], has an [[apparent magnitude]] of 2.9. Its &amp;gamma; star is a [[double star]] just south of &amp;beta;.  [[Mu Arae|&amp;mu; Arae]] is believed to have at least three planets orbiting it, one of which is thought to be rocky in nature.

== Notable deep sky objects ==
The northwest corner of Ara is crossed by the [[Milky Way]] and contains several [[open cluster]]s and [[diffuse nebula]]e. The brightest of the [[globular cluster]]s, [[NGC 6397]], is 8,200 [[light-year]]s from our [[solar system]] and may be the closest cluster of that kind.

== History ==
This constellation was one of [[Ptolemy]]'s original 48 constellations.

== Mythology ==
The altar, usually depicted upside down, but sometimes upright with the smoke drifting into the Milky Way, was identified as that of the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]]; its original Latin name was Ara Centauri. It was also occasionally called the altar of [[Dionysus]]. Since, however, the constellation was identified, and introduced, in the 18th Century, connection to this mythology is likely to have been by design of the constellation's creator, and unconnected to the actual beliefs of the ancient Greeks about this area of sky.

'''Arkansas''' ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|/ˈɑ(r)k(ə)nˌsɑː/}} or {{IPA|/ˈɑ(r)k(ə)nˌsɔ/}}) is a [[U.S. Southern States|Southern]] [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[United States]].  The population according to the [[United States Census, 2004|2004 census]] was 2,752,629.  It was admitted as the 25th state of the United States in 1836.

==History==
The early French explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling for the French word for &quot;downriver&quot; people, a reference to the [[Quapaw]] people and the river along which they settled. Other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] nations living in present-day Arkansas were [[Caddo]], [[Cherokee]] and [[Osage]] Nations. 

On [[June 15]], [[1836]], Arkansas became the 25th state of the [[United States]] as a [[slave state]]. Arkansas refused to join the [[Confederate States of America]] until after [[Abraham Lincoln]] called for troops to invade South Carolina. It seceded from the Union on May 6, 1861. The state was the scene of numerous small-scale battles during the [[American Civil War]]. Under the Military Reconstruction Act, Congress, in June 1868, readmitted Arkansas.

==Law and government==
[[Image:LR capitol.jpg|thumb|right|The Arkansas State Capitol.]]
The current governor of Arkansas is [[Mike Huckabee]], a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]. Huckabee, who had been elected lieutenant governor in a [[1993]] special election, became governor in [[1996]] when Governor [[Jim Guy Tucker]], a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], was convicted as part of the [[Whitewater Scandal]].  This led to a state &quot;Constitutional crisis&quot; when Tucker refused to give up the governor's office for a short period of time, because the Arkansas Constitution does not allow a convicted felon to be governor of the state. Tucker had been lieutenant governor under [[Bill Clinton]] and had become governor as a result of Clinton's election to the presidency. 

Arkansas' two U.S. Senators are Democrats [[Blanche Lincoln]] and [[Mark Pryor]]. The state has four seats in House of Representatives. Three seats are held by Democrats&amp;mdash;[[Marion Berry]] ([http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/preview/congdist/ar01_109.gif map]), [[Vic Snyder]] ([http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/preview/congdist/ar02_109.gif map]), and [[Mike Ross]] ([http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/preview/congdist/ar04_109.gif map]). One seat is held by the state's lone Republican Congressman, [[John Boozman]] ([http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/preview/congdist/ar03_109.gif map]). The Democratic Party holds [[super-majority]] status in the [[Arkansas General Assembly]]. Republicans actually lost seats in the State House in 2004. A majority of local and statewide offices are also held by Democrats. This arrangement is extremely rare in the modern [[U.S. Southern States|South]], where a majority of statewide offices are held by Republicans.

Most Republican strength lies mainly in northwest Arkansas in the area around [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], while the rest of the state is strongly Democratic. Arkansas has only elected one Republican to the United States Senate since [[Reconstruction]] and the Arkansas General Assembly has not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction, and is the fourth most Democratic Legislature in the country, after [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts]], [[Hawaii State Legislature|Hawaii]], and [[Connecticut General Assembly|Connecticut]]. Arkansas is also the only state among the states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that sends two Democrats to the U.S. Senate.  However, the state is perceived as generally being conservative &amp;ndash; its voters passed a ban on [[gay marriage]] and Arkansas is one of a handful of states that has legislation on its books banning [[abortion]] in the event [[Roe vs. Wade]] is ever overturned.

In Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.

Each office's term is four years long.  Office holders are [[term-limited]] to two full terms plus any partial terms prior to the first full term.

Some of Arkansas' [[counties]] have two county seats, as opposed to the usual one seat.  The arrangement dates back to when travel was extremely difficult in the states.  The seats are usually on opposite sides of the county.  Though travel is no longer the difficulty it once was, there are few efforts to eliminate the two seat arrangement where it exists, since the county seat is a source of pride (and jobs) to the city involved.

''See: [[List of Arkansas Governors]]''

===Pronunciation and symbols===
The state is the only one with a pronunciation specified by law.  
Section 105 of Chapter 4 of Title 1 of the Arkansas code&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/NXT/gateway.dll/ARCode/title00000.htm/chapter00063.htm/section00068.htm?f=templates$fn=document-frame.htm$3.0#JD_1-4-105]&lt;/sup&gt; determined in 1881 the official, codified pronunciation of Arkansas: &quot;It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final &quot;s&quot; silent, the &quot;a&quot; in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables.&quot;  The same section states that the variation ''are-KAN-sas'' &quot;is an innovation to be discouraged.&quot;

There are differing abbreviations of ''Arkansas'' in use:  '''AR''' ([[U.S. postal abbreviations|postal]]), 
'''Ark.''' ([[List of U.S. states by traditional abbreviation|traditional]] and [[AP Stylebook]]), and '''US-AR''' ([[ISO 3166-2]]).

==Geography==
{{ussm|arkansas.PNG|ar}}
''See: [[List of Arkansas counties]], [[List of cities in Arkansas]], [[List of Arkansas townships]], [[List of Arkansas native plants]].''

The capital of Arkansas is [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]. Arkansas is the only state in the US where [[Diamond|diamonds]] are found naturally (near [[Murfreesboro, Arkansas]]).

The eastern border for most of Arkansas is the [[Mississippi River]] except in Clay and Greene counties where the St. Francis River forms the western boundary of the [[Missouri Bootheel]]. Arkansas shares its southern border with [[Louisiana]], its northern border with [[Missouri]], its eastern border with [[Tennessee]] and [[Mississippi]], and its western border with [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. Arkansas is a beautiful land of mountains and valleys, thick forests and fertile plains. Northwest Arkansas is part of the [[Ozark Plateau]] including the [[Boston Mountains]], to the south are the [[Ouachita Mountains]] and these regions are divided by the Arkansas River; the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands.  

The so called Lowlands are better known as the [[Mississippi embayment|Delta]] and the Grand Prairie.  The land along the Mississippi river is referred to as the &quot;Delta&quot; of Arkansas. It gets this name from the formation of its rich alluvial soils formed from the flooding of the mighty Mississippi.  The Grand Prairie is slightly away from the Mississippi river in the southeast portion of the state and consists of a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas and home to much of the crop agriculture in the state.
[[Image:PetitJean.jpg|right|thumb|260px|''Petit Jean State Park'', one of many attractions that give the state's nickname ''The Natural State''.]]
Arkansas is home to many [[List of caves in Arkansas|cave]]s, such as [[Blanchard Springs Caverns]]. [[Hot Springs National Park]] and the [[Buffalo National River]] can also be found within its borders.

==Economy==
[[Image:wiki_arkansas.jpg|thumb|300px|Greetings from Arkansas]]
The state's total gross state product for 2003 was $76 billion. Its Per Capita Personal Income for 2003 was $24,384, 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the nation. The state's agriculture outputs are poultry and eggs, soybeans, sorghum, cattle, cotton, rice, hogs, and milk. Its industrial outputs are food processing, electric equipment, fabricated metal products, machinery, paper products, bromine, and vanadium.

In recent years, [[automobile]] parts manufacturers have opened factories in eastern Arkansas to support auto plants in other states (though Arkansas does not yet have an auto plant itself, it is rumored to be a future site for a [[Toyota]] plant as well as for a truck plant to be built by Toyota's subsidiary [[Hino Motors]]).

Tourism is also very important to the Arkansas economy; the official state nickname &quot;The Natural State&quot; is prominently displayed in state tourism advertising.

The effect of [[Tyson Foods]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[J.B. Hunt]] and other multinational companies located in NW Arkansas cannot be understated. The area is currently in a long-running economic boom due to being the forefront of Global Trade. [[Wal-Mart]] alone accounts for $8.90 out of every $100 spent in U.S. retail stores.

'''Abadan''' (&amp;#1570;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1583;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1606; in [[Persian language|Persian]]) is a city in the [[Khuzestan]] province in southwestern [[Iran]] ([[Persian empire|Persia]]). It lies on Abadan Island, on the [[Arvand]] river. In 2005 the population was estimated to be at 1,291,690.&lt;small&gt;[http://www.mongabay.com/igapo/2005_world_city_populations/Iran.html]&lt;/small&gt;

==Etymology==
In [[medieval]] sources and up to the present century, the name of the Island always occurs in the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] form '' 'Abadan''(ﻥﺍﺩﺎﺒﻋ). This name has sometimes been derived from the word ''worshiper''(ﺩﺎﺒﻋ). On the other hand, ''Beladori''(d.[[892]]) quotes the story that the town was founded by '' 'Abbad bin Hosayn Khabethi'', who established a garrison there during the governorship of ''Hajjaj'' in the [[Ummayad]] period. An Iranian etymology of the name  (from the Persian word &quot;ab&quot; (water) and the root &quot;p&amp;#257;&quot; (guard, watch) thus &quot;coastguard station&quot;), was suggested by ''B. Farahvashi''. Supporting evidence is the name &quot;Apphana&quot; which [[Ptolemy]] applies to an island off the mouth of The Tigris. The Persian version of the name had begun to come into general use before it was adopted by official decree in [[1935]] (see [http://www.iranica.com/articles/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=/home1/iranica/articles/v1_articles/abadan&amp;OptStrLogFile=/home/iranica/public_html/logs/pdfdownload.html Abadan], in [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], pp.51-52). 
The geographer Marcian also renders the name &quot;Apphadana&quot; in his writings (see ''Geographia Marciani Heracleotae'', ed. David Hoeschel, Augsburg 1600 p48).

==History==
Abadan is thought to have originally developed as a port city under the [[Abbasid]]s' rule. From 17th century onward, the Island of Abadan was part of the lands of the [[Arab]] ''Ka'ab'' ([[Bani Kaab]]) tribe. One section of this tribe, ''Mohaysen'', had its headquarters at ''Mohammara''(present-day [[Khorramshahr]]), until the removel of Shaikh [[Khaz'al Khan]] in [[1924]]. (see [http://www.iranica.com], p.53, under ''Abadan'')

It was not until the [[20th century]] that rich oil fields were discovered in the area. In 1910, the population had been around 400. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] built their first [[oil refinery]] in Abadan, starting in 1909 and completing it in 1913. By 1938, it was the largest in the world. To this day it remains a vast facility for refining [[petroleum]].

Only a low 9 percent of managers (of the oil company) were from Khuzestan. The proportion of natives of [[Tehran]], the [[Caspian]], [[Azarbaijan]] and [[Kurdistan Province, Iran|Kurdistan]] rose from 4 percent of [[blue collar]] workers to 22 percent of [[white collar]] workers to 45 percent of managers. Thus while [[Arabic]] speakers were concentrated on the lower rungs of the work force, managers tended to be brought in from some distance.(see [http://www.iranica.com], p.56, under ''Abadan'')

On [[August 20]] [[1978]], the Cinema Rex, a movie theater in Abadan, was locked from the outside and [[arson|set on fire]], resulting in 430 deaths. To this day it is not entirely clear what happened, but it was believed by some that the government of the Iranian [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] purposely set the theater ablaze to kill several [[dissident]]s who were hiding inside. This event sparked [[protest|mass demonstrations]] against Pahlavi's government, which was overthrown six months later by [[Islam]]ic [[fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] and their supporters (see [[Iranian Revolution]]). Most more accurately accuse Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of committing this tragedy.

In September 1980, Abadan was almost overrun during a surprise attack on Khuzestan by Iraq, marking the beginning of the [[Iran-Iraq War]]. For 18 months Abadan was besieged, but never captured, by Iraqi forces. Much of the city, including the oil refinery, was badly damaged or destroyed by the siege and by bombing. Previous to the war, the city's civilian [[population]] was about 300,000, but before it was over most of the populous had sought refuge elsewhere in Iran.

After the war, the biggest concern was the rebuilding of Abadan's oil refinery. In 1993 the refinery began limited operation, and by 1997 it reached the same rate of production it was at before the war.

===Recent events===
To honor the 100th anniversary of the refining of oil in Abadan, city officials are planning an &quot;oil [[museum]]&quot; {{ref|chn.ir}}

The [[Abadan Institute of Technology]] was established in Abadan in 1939. The school specialized in [[engineering]] and petroleum [[chemistry]], and was designed to train staff for the refinery in town. The school's name has since changed several times, but since 1989 has been considered a branch campus of the [[Petroleum University of Technology]], centered in [[Tehran]].

There is an international [[airport]] in Abadan. It is represented by the [[IATA airport code]] [[ABD]].

==Trivia==
* The Abadan oil refinery was featured on the reverse side of Iran's 100-rial banknotes printed in 1965 and from 1971 to 1973.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:Alexander-fleming.jpg|thumb|Alexander Fleming]]
Sir '''Alexander Fleming''' ([[August 6]], [[1881]] &amp;ndash; [[March 11]], [[1955]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[biologist]] and [[pharmacologist]]. He discovered the [[antibiotic]] substance [[lysozyme]] and isolated the antibiotic substance [[penicillin]] from the fungus ''[[Penicillium notatum]]'', for which he shared a [[Nobel Prize]].

== Birth and education==
Fleming was born on a [[farm]] at [[Lochfield]] near [[Darvel]] in [[East Ayrshire]],  and was schooled for two years at the Academy in [[Kilmarnock]]. He later attended [[St Mary's Hospital (London)|St Mary's Hospital]] medical school in [[London]] until [[World War I]] broke out. He and many of his colleagues worked in battlefield hospitals at the fronts in [[France]]. He learned of the works by [[Ernest Duchesne]].

==Fable==
The popular story of [[Lord Randolph Churchill|Winston Churchill's father]]'s paying for Fleming's education after Fleming's father saved young [[Winston Churchill|Winston]] from death is certainly false. According to the biography, &quot;Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution&quot; by Kevin Brown, Alexander Fleming is quoted as saying that this was &quot;a wonderful fable&quot;. Nor did he save Winston Churchill himself during WWII. Churchill was saved by [[Lord Moran]], using [[sulphonamide]]s, since he had no experience with penicillin, when Churchill fell ill in Carthage in Tunisia in 1943. The Daily Telegraph and The Morning Post on 21 December 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin. It is probable that, as [[sulphonamides]] were a German discovery, and there was a war with the Germans, the patriotic pride in the miracle cure of penicillin had something to do with this error in reporting.

==Rediscovery==
Fleming worked with the mold for some time, but refining and growing it was a difficult process better suited to chemists.  Fleming's impression was that, because of the problem of producing the drug in quantity and because its action seemed slow, it would not be an important resource for treating infection.  Furthermore, his initial paper was not well received in the medical community.  Fleming therefore did not pursue the subject further.  It was left to two other scientists, [[Howard Walter Florey|Howard Florey]] and [[Ernst Boris Chain]], to develop a method of purifying penicillin to an effective form.  Through their work, the drug was available for mass distribution during [[World War II]].

==Accolades==
For his achievements, Fleming was knighted in 1944, he was known as Sir Gustav santina, after his Grandfather, and step Great grandfather Gustav Lichtenstein, and Santina Gauchiosos ( from Checkoslavakia and Spain ). Fleming, Florey, and Chain were the joint recipients of the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] in 1945.  Florey was later given the honour of a peerage for his monumental work in making penicillin available to the public and saving millions of lives in World War II.

Fleming was ranked #43 on [[Michael H. Hart]]'s [[The 100|list of the most influential figures in history]].

The discovery of penicillin was ranked as the most important discovery of the millennium when the year 2000 was approaching by at least 3 large Swedish magazines, as seen in for example: http://www.nyteknik.se/pub/ipsart.asp?art_id=1462. 
It is impossible to know how many lives have been saved by this discovery, but some of these magazines placed their estimate near 200 million lives, which, if even remotely true, might arguably make this man the greatest hero ever.


Fleming was long a member of the [[Chelsea Arts Club]], a private club for artists of all genres, founded in 1891 at the suggestion of the painter [[James McNeil Whistler]]. Fleming was admitted to the club after he made &quot;germ paintings,&quot; in which he drew with a culture loop using spores of highly pigmented bacteria.  The bacteria were invisible while he painted, but when cultured made bright colours.
:''[[Serratia]] marcescens'' - red
:''[[Chromobacterium]] violaceum'' - purple
:''[[Micrococcus]] luteus'' - yellow 
:''[[Micrococcus]] varians'' - white 
:''[[Micrococcus]] roseus'' - pink 
:''[[Bacillus]] sp.'' - purple

==Death==
Fleming died in 1955 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 73. He was buried as a national hero in the crypt of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]]. His discovery of penicillin had changed the world of modern medicines by introducing the age of useful [[antibiotic]]s and his discovery of the penicillin has, and still, saved millions of people.

'''Andrew Carnegie''' ([[November 25]] [[1835]] &amp;ndash; [[August 11]] [[1919]]) was a [[Scottish-American]] [[List of business people|businessman]], a major [[philanthropist]], and the founder of the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] which later became [[U.S. Steel]].  He is known for having, later in his life, given away most of his riches to fund the establishment of many libraries, schools, and universities in America and worldwide.

==Formative influences==
===The Carnegie family in Scotland===
Andrew Carnegie was born on Wednesday, November 25, 1835, in [[Dunfermline]], [[Fife]], [[Scotland]].  He was the son of a [[hand loom]] weaver, William Carnegie.  His mother was Margaret, daughter of one Thomas Morrison, a [[tanner]] and [[shoemaker]].  

Many of Carnegie's closest relatives were self-educated tradesmen and class activists. William Carnegie, whilst poor, had educated himself and, as far as his resources would permit, saw to it that his children received an education, as well.  William Carnegie was moreover a militant political activist and was involved with those organising demonstrations against the [[Corn laws]].  He was also a [[Chartist]].  

Andrew Carnegie's maternal grandfather, Thomas Morrison, was one of the most persistent campaigners for [[Liberalism|liberal]] reforms in Scotland.  Through the dint of his own efforts of [[self education]], Thomas Morrison acquired an eloquence with the written word that matched his more privileged &quot;betters&quot;.  He wrote frequently to newspapers and contributed articles in the [[Radicalism|radical]] [[pamphlet]], ''Cobbett's Register'' edited by [[William Cobbett]].  Amongst other things, he argued for:  abolition of the [[Rotten Boroughs]] and reform of the [[British House of Commons]], which occurred much later in the [[Great Reform Act of 1832]], [[Catholic Emancipation]], and Laws governing safety at work, which were passed many years later in the [[Factory Acts]].  Most radically of all, however, he promoted the abolition of all forms of hereditary privilege, including all [[Monarchy|monarchies]]. 

Another great influence on the young Andrew Carnegie was his uncle, George Lauder, a proprietor of a small grocers shop in Dunfermline High Street.  This uncle introduced the young Carnegie to such historical Scottish heroes as [[Robert the Bruce]], [[William Wallace]], and [[Rob Roy]].  He was also introduced to the writings of [[Robbie Burns]].  It was, perhaps, Burns who most influenced Carnegie, who regarded Burns as one of the greatest preachers of [[Democracy]].  Uncle George Lauder had Carnegie commit to memory many pages of Burns's writings, writings that were to stay with him for the rest of his life. 

George Lauder was additionally interested in the [[United States]]. Lauder saw the U.S.A. as a country with &quot;democratic institutions&quot;. 

Another uncle, his mother's brother, &quot;Ballie&quot; Morrison, was also a  radical political firebrand. The chief object of this gentleman's tirades was the [[Church of England]] and the [[Church of Scotland]].  &quot;Ballie&quot; Morrison was a fervent [[nonconformist]].  In 1842, the young Carnegie's radical sentiments were stirred further at the news of Uncle &quot;Ballie&quot; being imprisoned for his part in a &quot;Cessation of Labour&quot; ([[Strike action|strike]]).  At this time, withdrawal of labour by an hireling was covered by criminal law.  Notwithstanding these literary and political influences, poverty in the Carnegie family was always at hand and severe.

=== Emigration to America===
Andrew Carnegie's father had worked as a jobbing hand loom weaver.  This involved receiving the mill's raw materials at his cottage and weaving them into cloth on the primitive loom in the cottage.  In the 1840's, a new system was coming into being, the factory system.  During this era, mill owners began constructing large weaving mills with looms powered at first by water wheels and later by steam engines. These factories could produce cloth at far lower cost, partly through increased mechanisation and economies of scale, but partly also by paying mill workers very low wages and by working them very long hours. The success of the mills forced William Carnegie to seek work in the mills or elsewhere away from home.  However, the radical views of Andrew Carnegie's father were well known, and he was not wanted. 

He chose to emigrate. His mother's two sisters had already emigrated, but it was his wife who persuaded William Carnegie to make the passage. Making the passage was not easy, however, for they had to find the passage money.  They were forced to sell their meagre possessions and borrow some £20 from friends, a considerable sum in 1848. 

That May, his family emigrated to the U.S.A., sailing on the ''Wiscasset'', a former [[whaler]] that took the family from Broomielaw, in [[Glasgow]], to New York.  From there they proceeded up the [[Hudson River]] and the [[Erie Canal]] to [[Lake Erie]] and then to [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]], where William Carnegie found work in a cotton factory.

Young Andrew Carnegie found work in the same building as a &quot;Bobbin boy&quot; for the sum of $1.20 per week. His younger brother, by some eight years, Thomas, was sent to school. Andrew Carnegie, the Scot, quickly became Andrew Carnegie the American. Three years after arriving in the U.S.A., the young Carnegie began writing to his friends in Scotland extolling the great virtues of American democracy whilst disparaging and criticising &quot;feudal British institutions&quot;.  At the same time, he followed in his father's footsteps and wrote letters to the newspapers including the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' on subjects such as slavery.

==Early career==
===1850-1860: A 'self made man'===
Andrew Carnegie's education and passion for reading was given a great boost by one Colonel [[James Anderson]], who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to working boys each Saturday night.  Carnegie was a most persistent borrower.  Andrew Carnegie was a &quot;self made man&quot; in the roundest possible sense insofar as it applied not only to his economic development but also to his intellectual and cultural development.  His capacity and willingness for hard work, his perseverance, and his alertness, soon brought forth opportunities. 

In 1851, he became a [[Telegraphy|Telegraph]] Messenger boy in the [[Pittsburgh]] Office of the [[Ohio Telegraph Company]], at $2.50 per week.  This, to the young Carnegie, seemed a fortune.  In addition to providing him with an increase in income, the job also provided him with a lifelong love of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] works.  He was frequently required to deliver messages to a [[theatre]], and he often managed to contrive appearing just as the curtain had been raised on a performance.  Using a charm that was to pay even greater dividends in the future, Carnegie was then usually able to convince the theatre's manager to allow him to stay and watch the performance for free.  When Carnegie was not at the theatre or improving his mind with a book, he would spend time listening to the telegraph instrument itself. The electric telegraph transmitted its signals along the wires that traversed the nation.  When they were received into the telegraph office, they were transcribed into readable script on a long paper tape with the aid of an elaborate machine.  He quickly learned to distinguish the differing sound the incoming signals produced and learned to transcribe, himself.  At the time, Andrew Carnegie was one of only two or three persons so gifted in the entire country.  Having learned Telegraphy, he was noted by [[Tom Scott (PRR)|Thomas A. Scott]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad Company]], who employed him as a secretary/Telegraph operator starting in 1853, at the princely salary of $4.00 per week.  Carnegie was sixteen and soon began a  rapid advancement through the company, eventually becoming the Superintendent of the Pittsburgh Division.

===1860-1865: Carnegie during the [[U.S. Civil War]]===
During the pre-war period, Andrew Carnegie had formed a partnership with a Mr. Woodruff, an inventor.  Woodruff's invention was the [[sleeping car]].  The great distances transversed by railways had meant stopping for the night at hotels and inns by the railside, so that passengers could rest.  The sleeping car sped up travel and helped Americans settle the American west.  The investment proved a great success and a source of great fortune for Woodruff and Carnegie.  The young Carnegie, who started work at an early age as a [[bobbin boy]] in a [[cotton]] mill, and, who was, a few years later, engaged as a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] clerk and operator with the [[Atlantic and Ohio Company]], now became the superintendent of the western division of the entire line.  In this post, Carnegie was responsible for several improvements in the service.  When the [[American Civil War]] opened in 1861, he accompanied Scott, then [[Assistant United States Secretary of War]], to the front.

Following his good fortune, Carnegie proceeded to increase it still further through fortunate and careful investments.  In 1864, Carnegie invested the sum of $40,000 in Storey Farm on [[Venango County, Pennsylvania|Oil Creek, in Venango County, Pennsylvania]].  In one year, the farm yielded over $1,000,000 in cash dividends, and oil from [[oil well]]s on the property sold profitably.  Carnegie was subsequently associated with others in establishing a [[steel]] [[rolling mill]].

Aside from Carnegie's investment successes, he was beginning to figure prominently in the American cause and in American culture.  With the Civil War raging, Carnegie soon found himself in Washington.  Carnegie was selected by his boss at the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, Thomas A. Scott, who was now Assistant Secretary of War in charge of military transportation, to join him in Washington.  Carnegie was appointed Superintendent of the Military Railways and the Union Government's telegraph lines in the East and was Scott's right hand man.  Carnegie, himself, was on the foot plate of the locomotive that pulled the first brigade of Union troops to reach Washington. Shortly after this, following the defeat of Union forces at Bull Run, he personally supervised the transportation of the defeated forces.  Under his organization, the telegraph service rendered efficient service to the Union cause and significantly assisted in the eventual victory.  During his work &quot;in the field&quot;, Carnegie fell ill and needed treatment for sunstroke.

The Civil War, as so many wars before it, brought boom times to the suppliers of war.  The U.S. iron industry was one such.  Before the war its production was of little significance, but the sudden huge demand brought boom times to Pittsburgh and similar cities and great wealth to the iron masters. 

Carnegie had some investments in this industry before the war and, after the war, left the railroads to devote all his energies to the ironworks trade.  Carnegie worked to develop several iron works, eventually forming The Keystone Bridge Works and the Union Ironworks, in Pittsburgh. Although he had left the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, he did not totally sever his links with the railroads.  These links would prove valuable.  The Keystone Bridge Company made iron train bridges, and, as company superintendent, Carnegie had noticed the weakness of the traditional wooden structures.  These were replaced in large numbers with iron bridges made in his works.  As well as having good business sense, Carnegie possessed charm and literary knowledge.  He was invited to many important  social functions, functions that Carnegie exploited to his own advantage and to the fullest extent. 

Carnegie’s philanthropic inclinations began some time before retirement.  He wrote; &quot;I propose to take an income no greater than $50,000 per annum! Beyond this I need ever earn, make no effort to increase my fortune, but spend the surplus each year for benevolent purposes!  Let us cast aside business forever, except for others.  Let us settle in Oxford and I shall get a thorough education, making the acquaintance of literary men.  I figure that this will take three years active work.  I shall pay especial attention to speaking in public.  We can settle in London and I can purchase a controlling interest in some newspaper or live review and give the general management of it attention, taking part in public matters, especially those connected with education and improvement of the poorer classes.  Man must have an idol and the amassing of wealth is one of the worst species of idolatry!  No idol is more debasing than the worship of money!  Whatever I engage in I must push inordinately; therefore should I be careful to choose that life which will be the most elevating in its character.  To continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and with most of my thoughts wholly upon the way to make more money in the shortest time, must degrade me beyond hope of permanent recovery.  I will resign business at thirty-five, but during these ensuing two years I wish to spend the afternoons in receiving instruction and in reading systematically!&quot; 

Carnegie postponed most of his philanthropic intentions to &quot;proper old age&quot;.

===Postwar years, 1865-1880: Carnegie the investor===
In the late 1860’s and into the 1870s, Carnegie was &quot;out and about and all over the place&quot;.  Carnegie now had new investments aside from the iron venture, the [[Keystone Bridge Company]].  Carnegie had added to his investments in Pennsylvania oil investments in [[Texas]], which earned him a small fortune, and, after the war, undertook several trips to [[Europe]] selling railroad securities on a commission basis for, among others, the London firm of [[Junius S. Morgan &amp; Company]].  The last of these trips was in 1872, the commission earned being $150,000.  Andrew Carnegie's multiple successes in bond selling, oil trading, and bridge building were so rapidly successful that the conservative Pittsburgh business community regarded him with a certain circumspection.  It was during these trips to Europe and to Britain, in particular, that Carnegie came into contact with British steel makers, then the world leaders.  He obtained a working knowledge of the [[Bessemer process]] of steel making and became a friend of its inventor, Sir [[Henry Bessemer]]. 

In 1868, he introduced the Bessemer steel making process into the U.S.A. and, in 1873, decided on a now famous gamble. He decided to &quot;put all his eggs in one basket, and then watch the basket.&quot;  That year he staked all his wealth on steel making.  His fellow Americans did not realize it at the time, but the day Carnegie decided to take this gamble was the day the eventual industrial supremacy of the U.S. became certain. It took Andrew Carnegie only a matter of a few years to become the principal owner of the [[Homestead &amp; Edgar Thompson Steel Works]], and only a short time more to be heading the firms of [[Carnegie, Phipps &amp; Company]] and[[ Carnegie Bros. &amp; Company]], as well.

===1880-1890: Carnegie the scholar and activist===
Whilst Carnegie continued his business career, some of his literary intentions were fulfilled.  During this time, he made many friends in the literary and political worlds.  Among these were such as [[Malcolm Arnold]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] as well as being in correspondence and acquaintance with most of the U.S. Presidents, statesmen, and notable writers of the time.  Many were visitors to the Carnegie home.  Carnegie greatly admired [[Herbert Spencer]], the polymath who seemed to know everything.  He did not, however, agree with Spencer's [[Social Darwinism]] which held that philanthropy was a bad idea. 
 
In 1881, Andrew Carnegie took his family, which included his mother, then aged 70, on a trip to Great Britain. They toured the sights of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] by coach having several receptions en-route.  The highlight for them all was a triumphal return to Dunfermline where Carnegie's mother laid the foundation stone of the &quot;Carnegie Library&quot;.  Andrew Carnegie's criticism of British society did not point to a dislike of the country of his birth, on the contrary, one of Carnegie's ambitions was to act as a catalyst for a close association between the English speaking peoples.  To this end, he purchased, in the first part of the 1880's, a number of newspapers in England, all of which were to advocate the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of &quot;the British Republic&quot;.  Surprisingly, Carnegie's charm aided by his great wealth meant that he had many British friends, including [[Prime Minister]] [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]. 

In 1886, tragedy struck Carnegie when his young brother Thomas died at the early age of 43.  Success in the business continued, however.  At the same time as owning steel works, Carnegie had purchased, at low cost, the most valuable of the iron ore fields around Lake Superior.  The same year Andrew Carnegie became a figure of controversy.  Following his tour of Great Britain, he wrote about his experiences in a book entitled, ''An American Four-in-hand in Britain''.  Although still actively involved in running his many businesses, Carnegie had become a regular contributor of articles to numerous serious minded magazines, most notably the ''Nineteenth Century'', under the editorship of [[James Knowles]], and the ''North American Review'', whose editor, [[Lloyd Bryce]], oversaw the publication during its most influential period.

That year, 1886, Carnegie penned his most radical work to date, entitled ''Triumphant Democracy''.  The work, liberal in its use of statistics to make its arguments, was an attempt to argue his view that the American [[republic]]an system of government was superior to the British [[monarchy|monarchical]] system.  It not only gave a overly-favourable and idealistic view of American progress, but made some considerable criticism of the British royal family.  Most antagonistic, however, was the cover that depicted amongst other motifs, an upended royal crown and a broken sceptre.  Given these aspects, it was no surprise that the book was the cause of some considerable controversy in Great Britain.  The book itself was successful.  It made many Americans aware for the first time of their country's economic progress and sold over 40,000 copies, mostly in the U.S.A. 

In 1889, Carnegie stirred up yet another hornet's nest when an article entitled [http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/rbannis1/AIH19th/Carnegie.html &quot;Wealth&quot; appeared in the June issue of the ''North American Review''.]  After reading it, Gladstone requested its publication in England, and it appeared under a new title, &quot;The Gospel of Wealth&quot; in the ''Pall Mall Gazette''.  The article itself was the subject of much discussion.  In the article, the author argued that the life of a wealthy industrialist such as Carnegie should comprise two parts.  The first part was the gathering and the accumulation of wealth. The second part was to be used for the subsequent distribution of this wealth to benevolent causes.

==Carnegie the industrialist==
===1885-1900: Building an empire of steel===
[[Image:Steelmills.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A steel mill owned by Andrew Carnegie in Pittsburgh, PA]]
But all this was only a preliminary to the success attending his development of the [[iron]] and [[steel]] industries at [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].  Carnegie made his fortune in the steel industry, controlling the most extensive integrated iron and steel operations ever owned by an individual in the United States. His great innovation was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel rails for railroad lines. 

In the late 1880s, Carnegie Steel was the largest manufacturer of [[pig iron|pig-iron]], [[steel-rails]], and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in the world, with a capacity to produce approximately 2,000 tons of [[pig metal|pig-metal]] a day. In 1888, he bought the rival [[Homestead Steel Works]], which included an extensive plant served by tributary coal and iron fields, a railway 425 miles long, and a line of lake steamships.  An agglutination of the assets of he and his associates occurred in 1892 with the launching of the [[Carnegie Steel Company]].  

By 1889, the U.S. output of steel exceeded that of the U.K., and Andrew Carnegie owned a large part of it.  Carnegie had risen to the heights he had by being a supreme organiser and judge of men.  He had the talent of being able to surround himself with able and effective men, while, at the same time, retaining the control and the direction of the enterprise.  Carnegie's businesses were uniquely organised in that his belief in &quot;democratic principles&quot; found itself interpreted into these businesses.  This did not mean that Carnegie was not in absolute control, however.  The businesses incorporated Carnegie's own version of profit sharing.  Carnegie wanted his employees to have a stake in the business, for he knew that they would work best if they saw that their own self interest was allied to the firm's.  As a result, men who had started as labourers in some cases, eventually ended up millionaires. Carnegie also often encouraged unfriendly competition between two of his workers and goaded them into outdoing one another. These rivalries became so important to some of the workers that they wouldn't talk to each other for years. Carnegie maintained control by incorporating his enterprises not as joint stock corporations but as limited partnerships with Carnegie as majority and controlling partner.  Not a cent of stock was publicly sold.  If a member died or retired, his stock was purchased at book value by the company.  Similarly, the other partners could vote to call in stock from those partners who underperformed, forcing them to resign. 

The internal organisation of his businesses was not the only reason for Andrew Carnegie's rise to pre-eminence.  Carnegie introduced the concept of counter-cyclical investment.  Carnegie's competitors, along with virtually every other business enterprise across the globe, pursued the conventional strategy of procyclical investment; manufacturers reinvesting profits in new capital in times of boom and high demand. Because demand is high, investment in bull markets is is more expensive. In response, Carnegie developed and implemented a secret tactic. He shifted the purchasing cycle of his companies to slump times, when business was depressed and prices low.  Carnegie observed that business cycles alternated between &quot;boom&quot; and &quot;bust&quot;.  He saw that if he capitalized during a slump, his costs would be lower and profits higher. During the years 1893 to 1897, there was a great slump in economic demand, and so Carnegie made his move.  At rock bottom prices, he upgraded his entire operation with the latest and most cost effective steel mills.  When demand picked up, prosperity followed for the Homestead &amp; Edgar Thompson Steel Works, the Carnegie, Phipps &amp; Company, and Carnegie Bros. &amp; Company as a flood tide of profit.  In 1900, the profits of Carnegie Bros. &amp; Company alone stood at $40,000,000 with $25,000,000 being Carnegie's share.

Carnegie's empire grew to include the [[J. Edgar Thomson Steel Works]], (named for [[John Edgar Thomson]], Carnegie's former boss and president of the Pennsylvania Railroad), Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works, the Lucy Furnaces, the Union Iron Mills, the Union Mill (Wilson, Walker &amp; County), the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines.  Also, Carnegie, through Keystone, supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark [[Eads Bridge]] project across the Mississippi River in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] (completed 1874).  This project was an important proof-of-concept for steel technology which marked the opening of a new steel market.

===1901: The formation of U.S. Steel===
Carnegie was now 65 and was wanting to retire.  He reformed his enterprises into conventional joint stock corporations as preparation to this end.  Carnegie, however, wanted a good price for his stock.  There was a man who was to give him his price.  This man was [[John Pierpont Morgan]]. 

Morgan was a banker and perhaps America's most important financial deal maker. He had observed how efficiency produced profit. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers and raise wages to workers. To this end he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers, and integrate them all into one company by eliminating duplication and waste. Negotiations were concluded on 2nd March with the formation of the United States Steel Corporation.  It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization in excess of $1,000,000,000.

The buyout, which was negotiated in secret by [[Charles M. Schwab]] (no relation to [[Charles R. Schwab]], the brokerage house founder), was the largest such industrial takeover in [[United States]] history to date. The holdings were incorporated in the [[United States Steel Corporation]], a trust organized by [[J. P. Morgan]], and Carnegie himself retired from business. His steel enterprises were bought out at a figure equivalent to twelve times their annual earnings; $480 million [http://www.carnegie.org/sub/kids/legacy.html], which at the time was the largest ever personal commercial transaction. Andrew Carnegie's share of this amounted to a massive $225,639,000 which was paid to Carnegie in the form of 5%, 50 year gold bonds.  The letter agreeing to sell his share was signed on the 26th February, 1901.  On the 2nd March 1901, the circular formally filing the organisation and capitalisation (at $1,400,000,000 - 4% of U.S national wealth at the time) of the United States Steel Corporation actually completed the contract.  The bonds were to be delivered within two weeks to the Hudson Trust Company of Hoboken, New Jersey in trust to Robert A. Franks, Carnegie's business secretary.  There, a special vault was built to house the physical bulk of nearly $230,000,000 worth of bonds.  It was said that &quot;....Carnegie never wanted to see or touch these bonds that represented the fruition of his business career. It was as if he feared that if he looked upon them they might vanish like the gossamer gold of the leprechaun. Let them lie safe in a vault in New Jersey, safe from the New York tax assessors, until he was ready to dispose of them....&quot;

As they signed the papers of sale, Carnegie remarked, &quot;Well, Pierpont, I am now handing the burden over to you.&quot;  In return, Andrew Carnegie became one of the world's wealthiest men.  Retirement was a stage in life that many men dreaded.  Carnegie was not one of them.  He was looking forward to retirement, for it was his intention to follow a new course from then on.

Besides steel, Carnegie's companies were involved in other areas of the railroad industry.  His company, [[Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works]], was noted for its building of large [[steam locomotive]]s at the turn of the 20th century.  His associates and partners included [[Henry Clay Frick]] and [[F. T. F. Lovejoy]].

He owned 18 English [[newspapers]], which he controlled in the interests of [[radicalism]].

At the height of his career, he was the second richest person in the world, behind only [[John D. Rockefeller]].

==1901-1915: Carnegie the philanthropist==
Andrew Carnegie spent his last years as a [[philanthropist]].  From 1901 forward, public attention was turned from the shrewd business capacity which had enabled Carnegie to accumulate such a fortune, to the public-spirited way in which he devoted himself to utilizing it on philanthropic objects.  His views on social subjects and the responsibilities which great wealth involved were already known from ''Triumphant Democracy'' (1886), and from his &quot;[[Gospel of Wealth]]&quot; (1900).  He acquired [[Skibo Castle]], in [[Sutherland]], [[Scotland]], and made his home partly there and partly in New York and then devoted his life to the work of providing the capital for purposes of public interest and social and educational advancement. 

In all his ideas, he was dominated by an intense belief in the future and influence of the English-speaking people, in their democratic government and alliance for the purpose of peace and the abolition of war, and in the progress of education on nonsectarian lines.  He was a powerful supporter of the movement for [[spelling reform]] as a means of promoting the spread of the [[English language]].
[[Image:Carnegie-library-flint-mi.png|left|thumb|220px|Carnegie established over 1600 libraries in the U.S. alone.]]
Among all of his many philanthropic efforts, the establishment of [[public library|public libraries]] in the United States, the [[United Kingdom]], and in other English-speaking countries was especially prominent.  [[Carnegie library|Carnegie libraries]], as they were commonly called, sprang up on all sides.  The first of which was opened in 1883 in Dunfermline, Scotland.  His method was to build and equip, but only on condition that the local authority provided site and maintenance.  To secure local interest, in 1885, he gave $500,000 to Pittsburgh for a public library, and in 1886, he gave $250,000 to Allegheny City for a music hall and library, and $250,000 to Edinburgh, Scotland, for a free library. In total Carnegie funded some 3,000 libraries, located in every [[U.S. state]] except [[Alaska]], and [[Delaware]]. Carnegie also built libraries in [[Canada]] and overseas in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[West Indies]], and [[Fiji]].

He gave $2 million in 1901 to start the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (CIT) at [[Pittsburgh]] and the same amount in 1902 to found the [[Carnegie Institution]] at [[Washington, D.C.]].  He would later contribute more to these and other schools.  CIT is now part of [[Carnegie Mellon University]].

In Scotland, he gave $2 million in 1901 to establish a trust for providing funds for assisting education at the Scottish universities, a benefaction which resulted in his being elected [[Lord Rector]] of [[University of St. Andrews]].  He was a large benefactor of the [[Tuskegee Institute]] under [[Booker Washington]] for [[African American]] education.  He also established large pension funds in 1901 for his former employees at Homestead and, in 1905, for American college professors.  He also funded the construction of 7,000 church organs.
[[Image:Carnaigiebirthplace.jpg|thumb|Carnegie's birthplace in Scotland is now a museum.]]
Also, long before he sold out, in 1879, he erected commodious swimming-baths for the use of the people of his hometown of Dunfermline, Scotland.  In the following year, Carnegie gave $40,000 for the establishment of a free library in the same city.  In 1884, he gave $50,000 to [[Bellevue Hospital Medical College]] to found a [[histology|histological]] laboratory, now called the [[Carnegie Laboratory]].

He owned [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City]] from its construction in 1890 until his widow sold it in 1924. 

He also founded the [[Carnegie Hero Fund]] commissions in America (1904) and in the United Kingdom (1908) for the recognition of deeds of heroism, contributed $500,000 in 1903 for the erection of a [[Peace Palace]] at [[The Hague]], and donated $150,000 for a [[Pan-American Palace]] in Washington as a home for the [[International Bureau of American Republics]].

By the rough and ready standards of 19th century tycoons, Carnegie was not a particularly ruthless man, but the contrast between his life and the lives of many of his own workers and of the poor, in general, was stark.  &quot;Maybe with the giving away of his money,&quot; commented biographer Joseph Wall, &quot;he would justify what he had done to get that money.&quot; [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carnegie/filmmore/description.html]

By the time he died in [[Lenox, Massachusetts]], Carnegie had given away $350,695,653.  At his death, the last $30,000,000 was likewise given away to foundations, charities, and to pensioners. 

He is interred in [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]] in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].

==Later personal life==
In an era in which financial capital was consolidated in [[New York City]], Carnegie famously stayed aloof from the city, preferring to live near his factories in western [[Pennsylvania]] and at [[Skibo Castle]], [[Scotland]], which he bought and refurbished.  However, he also built (in 1901) and resided in a townhouse on [[New York City]]'s [[Fifth Avenue]] that later came to house [[Cooper-Hewitt]]'s [[National Design Museum]].

Carnegie married [[Louise Whitfield]] in 1887 and had one daughter, Margaret, who was born in 1897.  His brother, [[Thomas M. Carnegie]], also born in Dunfermline, Scotland, was born on [[October 2]], [[1843]].  He was associated with Andrew in his business enterprises, but died in [[Homewood, Pennsylvania]], on [[October 19]], [[1886]].

==Controversial aspects of Carnegie's life==
===1892: The Homestead strike===
[[Image:Homesteadstrike.jpg|thumb|right|The Homestead Strike]]
The [[Homestead Strike]] was a bloody labor confrontation lasting one-hundred and forty-three days in 1892 and was one of the most serious in the history of the United States. The conflict was situated around Carnegie Steel's main [[Homestead]], [[Pennsylvania]] plant and grew out of disputation between the National Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers of the United States and the Carnegie Steel Company.

Carnegie, who had cultivated a pro-labor image in his dealings with company mill workers, departed the country for a trip to his Scottish homeland before the unrest peaked.  In doing so, Carnegie left mediation of the dispute in the hands of his associate and partner [[Henry Clay Frick]].  Frick was well known in industrialist circles as maintaining staunch anti-union sensibilities.

The company had attempted to cut the wages of the skilled steel workers, and, when the workers refused the pay cut, management locked the union out (workers considered the stoppage a &quot;[[lockout (industry)|lockout]]&quot; by management and not a &quot;[[Strike action|strike]]&quot; by workers).  Frick brought in thousands of strikebreakers to work the steel mills and [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agents to safeguard them.

The arrival, on the [[July_6|6th of July]], of a force of three hundred [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agents from [[New York City]] and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] resulted in a fight in which ten men - seven strikers and three Pinkertons - were killed and hundreds were injured.  Pennsylvania Governor [[Robert Pattison]] discharged two brigades of the state militia to the strike site.  Then, allegedly in response to the fight between the striking workers and the Pinkertons, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Alexander Berkman]] tried to kill Henry Clay Frick with a gun provided by [[Emma Goldman]].  However, [[Henry_Clay_Frick#Assassination_Attempt|Frick was only wounded]], and the attempt turned public opinion away from the striking workers.  Afterwards, the company successfully resumed operations with non-unionized immigrant employees in place of the Homestead plant workers, and Carnegie returned stateside.

Carnegie was one of over 50 wealthy members of the [[South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club]], which was blamed for the [[Johnstown Flood]] that killed over 2,200 people in 1887.

==Philosophy==
Carnegie wrote ''[[The Gospel of Wealth]]'', in which he stated his belief that the rich should use their wealth to help enrich society.

The following is taken from one of Carnegie's memos to himself: {{cquote|Man does not live by bread alone. I have known millionaires starving for lack of the nutriment which alone can sustain all that is human in man, and I know workmen, and many so-called poor men, who revel in luxuries beyond the power of those millionaires to reach. It is the mind that makes the body rich. There is no class so pitiably wretched as that which possesses money and nothing else. Money can only be the useful drudge of things immeasurably higher than itself. Exalted beyond this, as it sometimes is, it remains Caliban still and still plays the beast. My aspirations take a higher flight. Mine be it to have contributed to the enlightenment and the joys of the mind, to the things of the spirit, to all that tends to bring into the lives of the toilers of Pittsburgh sweetness and light. I hold this the noblest possible use of wealth.}}

Carnegie also believed that achievement of financial success could be reduced to a simple formula, which could be duplicated by the average person.  In 1908, he commissioned [[Napoleon Hill]], then a newspaper reporter, to interview over 500 millionaires to find out the common threads of their success.  Hill eventually became his adviser, and their work was published in 1928, after Carnegie's death, in Hill's book ''[[The Law of Success]]''.

==Writings==
Carnegie was a frequent contributor to periodicals on labour issues.

In addition to ''[[Triumphant Democracy]]'' (1886), ''[[Gospel of Wealth]]'' (1900) and ''[[The Law of Success]]'' (1928), other publications by him were ''An American Four-in-hand in Britain'' (1883), ''[[Round the World]]'' (1884), ''[[The Empire of Business]]'' (1902), a ''[[Life of James Watt]]'' (1905) and ''[[Problems of To-day]]'' (1908).

==Trivia==
* Various sources quote Carnegie's height at 5 feet (1.524 metre) 5 feet 1&quot; (1.549 metre) 5 feet 2&quot; (1.578 metre) or 5 feet 3&quot; (1.6 metre) - there is even one at 5 feet 6&quot; (1.676 metres) - but this must be considered as being incorrect - in other words; he was short.
* Two municipalities in the United States are named after Andrew Carnegie, the most famous being [[Carnegie, PA]]. The other is [[Carnegie, OK]].
* The dinosaur ''[[Diplodocus]] carnegiei'' (Hatcher) was named for Andrew Carnegie after he sponsored the expedition that discovered its remains in the [[Morrison Formation]] ([[Jurassic]]) of [[Utah]].  Carnegie was so proud of “Dippi” that he had casts made of the bones and plaster replicas of the whole skeleton donated to several museums in Europe.  The original fossil skeleton is assembled and stands in the Hall of Dinosaurs at the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] in [[Pittsburgh, PA]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Manner_of_articulation}}

'''Approximants''' are speech sounds that could be regarded as intermediate between [[vowel]]s and typical [[consonant]]s. In the articulation of approximants, articulatory organs produce a narrowing of the vocal tract, but leave enough space for air to flow without much audible turbulence. Approximants are therefore more open than [[Fricative|fricatives]]. This class of sounds includes [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] approximants like {{IPA|[l]}}, as in ''lip'', and approximants like {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} in ''yes'' and ''well'' which correspond closely to [[vowel]]s and [[semivowel]]s. 

==Corresponding vowels==

[[palatal consonant|Palatal]] approximants correspond to [[front vowel]]s, [[velar consonant|velar]] approximants to [[back vowel]]s, and labialized approximants to [[rounded vowel]]s. They are typically briefer and closer than the corresponding vowels. 

==Approximants vs. fricatives==

When emphasized, approximants may be slightly fricated (that is, the airstream may become slightly turbulent), which is reminiscent of fricatives. Examples are the ''y'' of English ''yes!'' (especially when lengthened) and the &quot;weak&quot; [[allophones]] of [[Spanish pronunciation|Spanish]] ''b, d, g'', which are often transcribed as fricatives (often due perhaps to a lack of dedicated approximant symbols). However, such frication is generally slight and intermittant, unlike the strong turbulence of fricative consonants. 

This confusion is also common with voiceless approximants, which necessarily have a certain amount of fricative-like noise. For example, the voiceless labialized velar approximant {{IPA|[ʍ]}} has traditionally been called a fricative. [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]] has a voiceless lateral approximant, {{IPA|[l̥]}}, and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] has a voiceless lateral fricative {{IPA|[ɬ]}}, but the distinction is not always clear from descriptions of these languages. 

For places of articulation further back in the mouth, languages do not contrast voiced fricatives and approximants. Therefore the IPA allows the symbols for the voiced fricatives to double for the central approximants, with or without a lowering [[diacritic]]. 

Occasionally the glottal &quot;fricatives&quot; are called approximants, since [h] typically has no more frication than voiceless approximants, but they are often [[phonation]]s of the glottis without any accompanying manner or place of articulation. 

==Central approximants==

*[[bilabial approximant]] {{IPA|[β̞]}} (usually written {{IPA|&lt;β&gt;}})
*[[labiodental approximant]] {{IPA|[ʋ]}}
*[[dental approximant]] {{IPA|[ð̞]}} (usually written {{IPA|&lt;ð&gt;}})
*[[alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[ɚ]}})
*[[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|[ɻ]}}
*[[palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[j]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[i]}})
*[[velar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɰ]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[ɯ]}})
*[[uvular approximant]] {{IPA|[ʁ̞]}} (usually written {{IPA|&lt;ʁ&gt;}})
*[[pharyngeal approximant]] {{IPA|[ʕ̞]}} (usually written {{IPA|&lt;ʕ&gt;}})
*[[epiglottal approximant]] {{IPA|[ʢ̞]}} (usually written {{IPA|&lt;ʢ&gt;}})

==Lateral approximants==

*[[alveolar lateral approximant|voiced alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[l]}}
*[[voiceless alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[l̥]}}
*[[retroflex lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[ɭ]}}
*[[palatal lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[ʎ]}}
*[[velar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[ʟ]}}

==Coarticulated approximants with dedicated IPA symbols==

*[[voiced labial-velar approximant|voiced labialized velar approximant]] {{IPA|[w]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[u]}})
*[[voiceless labial-velar fricative|voiceless labialized velar approximant]] {{IPA|[ʍ]}} 
*[[labial-palatal approximant|labialized palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[ɥ]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[y]}})
*[[velarized alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[ɫ]}}

==A &quot;central&quot; approximant?==
Although many languages have [[central vowel]]s {{IPA|[ɨ, ʉ]}} which lie between back/velar {{IPA|[ɯ, u]}} and front/palatal {{IPA|[i, y]}}, there are no confirmed reports of corresponding approximants. However, [[Mapudungun_language|Mapudungun]] may be a possibility: It has three high vowel sounds, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/&amp;#616;/}}, written &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;ü&quot;, and three corresponding consonants, written &quot;y&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;q&quot;. The first two are clearly {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}. The &quot;q&quot; is often described as a voiced unrounded velar fricative, but some texts note a correspondence between &quot;q&quot; and {{IPA|/&amp;#616;/ that is parallel to {{IPA|/j/}}-{{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}-{{IPA|/u/}}. An example is ''liq'' {{IPA|/'liɣ/}} &quot;white&quot; [http://www.logosdictionary.org/sound/mp/5119539_n.wav].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Astronomer Royal''' is a senior post in the [[Royal Household]] of the [[Monarch | Sovereign]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. There are two officers, the senior being the Astronomer Royal dating from [[22 June]] [[1675]], and the second the [[Astronomer Royal for Scotland]], which dates from [[1834]].

[[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], who founded the [[Royal Observatory Greenwich]] in [[1675]] instructed the first Astronomer Royal [[John Flamsteed]], &quot;to apply himself with the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying of the tables of the motions of the heavens, and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out the so much desired longitude of places for the perfecting of the art of navigation.&quot;

From that time until [[1972]] the Astronomer Royal was Director of the Royal Observatory Greenwich. As Astronomer Royal he receives a [[stipend]] of £100 a year and is a member of the [[Royal Household]], under the general authority of the [[Lord Chamberlain]]. After the separation of the two offices the position of Astronomer Royal has been largely honorary, though he remains available to advise the Sovereign on astronomical and related scientific matters, and the office is of great prestige.

There was also formerly an [[Astronomer Royal for Ireland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the [[Geology|geologic]] word, see [[eon]]. For other uses of Aeon, see [[Aeon (disambiguation)]].''

The [[Latin]] word '''''aeon''''', also spelled '''''eon''''' or '''''æon''''', means &quot;forever&quot; or &quot;for [[eternity]]&quot;.  It is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word αίών (''aion''), which at one point meant &quot;a period of existence&quot; or &quot;life&quot;.

In [[geology]], the word [[eon (geology)|eon]] quantitatively refers to a period of time of 1,000,000,000 years. However, geologists refer to the period in which [[animal]]s evolved into abundance as the [[Phanerozoic]] Eon, which has only lasted 545 million years, to the present day.

==In philosophy and mysticism==
Occultists sometimes speak of a &quot;magical Aeon&quot; that may last for far less time, perhaps as little as 2,000 years. See [[Thelema]].

[[Plato]] used the word ''aeon'' to denote the eternal world of ideas, which he conceived was &quot;behind&quot; the perceived world, as demonstrated in his famous [[Plato's allegory of the cave|cave allegory]].

===In Gnosticism===
In many [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] systems, the various [[emanationism|emanations]] of the [[God]], who is also known by such names as '''the One''', the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]], Aion teleos (The Perfect Aeon), [[Bythos]] (Depth or profundity, Greek Βυθος), Proarkhe (Before the Beginning, Greek προαρχη), E Arkhe (The Beginning, Greek η αρχη), are called '''aeons'''. This first being is also an æon and has an inner being within itself, known as Ennoea (Thought), Charis (Grace), or Sige (Greek Σιγη, Silence). The split perfect being conceives the second aeon, Caen (Power), within itself. Along with the male Caen comes the female æon Akhana (Truth, Love).

The aeons often came in male/female pairs called ''syzygies'', and were frequently numerous (20-30). Two of the most commonly listed æons were [[Jesus]] and [[Sophia (gnosticism)|Sophia]]. The aeons constitute the ''[[pleroma]]'', the &quot;region of light&quot;. The lowest regions of the pleroma are closest to the darkness; that is, the physical world.

When an æon named ''Sophia'' emanates without her partner aeon, the result is the ''[[Demiurge]]'', or half-creator (Occasionaly referred to as '''Ialdaboth''' in Gnostic texts), a creature that should never have come into existence. This creature does not belong to the pleroma, and the One emanates two savior æons, ''[[Christ]]'' and ''the [[Holy Spirit]]'' to save man from the Demiurge. Christ then took the form of the man, ''Jesus'', in order to be able to teach man how to achieve [[gnosis]]; that is, return to the pleroma.

====Valentinus====
According to [[Tertullian]]'s ''Against the Valentinians'' (Latin: ''Adversus Valentinianos'') chapter VII and VIII (and we only know the details of this system from its opponents), the Gnostic [[Valentinius]] had 30 different aeons which emanate each other in sequence. The first 8 of these (corresponding to generations one through four below) is referred to as the ''Ogdoad''.

*First generation
**''Bythos'' (the One) and ''Sige'' (Silence, Charis, Ennoea etc)
*Second generation
**''Caen'' (Power) and ''Akhana'' (Love)
*Third generation, emanated from Caen and Akhana
**''Nous'' (Nus, Mind) and ''Aletheia'' (Veritas, Truth)
*Fourth generation, emanated from Nous and Aletheia
**''Sermo'' (the Word) and ''Vita'' (the Life)
*Fifth generation, emanated from Sermo and Vita
**''Anthropos'' (Homo, Man) and ''Ecclesia'' (Church)
*Sixth generation
**Emanated from Sermo and Vita:
***''Bythios'' (Profound) and ''Mixis'' (Mixture) 
***''Ageratos'' (Never old) and ''Henosis'' (Union)
***''Autophyes'' (Essential nature) and ''Hedone'' (Pleasure)
***''Acinetos'' (Immovable) and ''Syncrasis'' (Commixture)
***''Monogenes'' (Only-begotten) and ''Macaria'' (Happiness)
**Emanated from Anthropos and Ecclesia
***''Paracletus'' (Comforter) and ''Pistis'' (Faith)
***''Patricas'' (Paternal) and ''Elpis'' (Hope)
***''Metricos'' (Maternal) and ''Agape'' (Love)
***''Ainos'' (Praise) and ''Synesis'' (Intelligence)
***''Ecclesiasticus'' (Son of Ecclesia) and ''Macariotes'' (Blessedness)
***''Theletus'' (Perfect) and ''Sophia'' (Wisdom)

====Ptolemy and Colorbasus====
According to [[Irenaeus|St. Irenaeus]] ''Against heresies'' (Latin: ''Adversus Haereses'') also known as ''The Detection and Overthrow of Falsely So-Called Gnosis'' book 1, chapter 12, the followers of the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] [[Ptolemy (Gnostic)|Ptolemy]] and [[Colorbasus]] had aeons which differ from those of [[Valentinius]]. Logos is created when Anthropos learn to speak. The first four are called the ''Tetrad'' and the eight are called the ''Ogdoad''.

*First generation
**''Bythos'' (the One) and ''Sige'' (Silence, Charis, Ennoea etc)
*Second generation (conceived by the One):
**''Caen'' (Power) and ''Akhana'' (Love)
*Third generation, emanated from Caen and Akhana:
**''Ennoae'' (Thought) and ''Thelesis'' (Will)
*Fourth generation, emanated from Ennoae and Thelesis:
**''Nous'' (or ''Monogenes'') and ''Aletheia''
*Fifth generation, emanated from Nouse and Aletheia:
**''Anthropos'' (Homo, Man) and ''Ecclesia'' (Church)
*Sixth generation, emanated from Anthropos and Ecclesia:
**''Logos'' and ''Zoe''
*Seventh generation:
**Emanated from Logos and Zoe:
***''Bythius'' and ''Mixis''
***''Ageratos'' and ''Henosis''
***''Autophyes'' and ''Hedone''
***''Acinetos'' and ''Syncrasis''
***''Monogenes'' and ''Macaria''
**Emanated from Anthropos and Ecclesia:
***''Paracletus'' and ''Pistis''
***''Patricos'' and ''Elpis''
***''Metricos'' and ''Agape''
***''Ainos'' and ''Synesis''
***''Ecclesiasticus'' and ''Macariotes''
***''Theletos'' and ''Sophia''

The order of Anthropos and Ecclesia versus Logos and Zoe are somewhat debated, different sources give different accounts. Logos and Zoe are unique to this system as compared to the previous and may be an evolved version of the first, totalling 34 æons, but it is not clear if the first two were actually regarded æons.

[[image:virgin.b747-400.g-vbig.arp.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-400]] belonging to [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]], one of the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s largest airlines.]]

An '''airline''' is an organization that  specializes in providing scheduled [[civil aviation|air transport services]] to [[passenger|passengers]] and/or for [[freight]]; although some airlines do provide [[Charter airline|chartered]] [[aviation|flight]] services as well. Airlines [[lease|lease]] or own their [[airliner|aircraft]] with which to supply these services and may form [[partnerships]] or [[alliances]] with other airlines for reasons of mutual benefit. 

==Industry overview==
The scale and scope of airline companies are from those with a single airplane carrying mail or cargo, through full-service international airlines operating many hundreds of airplanes in various types. Airline services can be categorized as being intercontinental, intracontinental, [[regional airline|regional]] or domestic and may be operated as scheduled services or charters.

These variations in the types of airline companies, their operating scope, and the routes they serve makes analysis of the airline industry somewhat complex. Nevertheless, some patterns have emerged in the last 50 years of experience:

[[Image:Air-India-building.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The headquarters of [[Air India]] in [[Mumbai]].]]
* The general pattern of ownership has gone from government owned or supported to independent, for-profit public companies. This occurs as regulators permit greater freedom, in steps that are usually decades apart. This pattern has not been completed for all airlines in all regions.

* The demand for air travel services is derived demand. That is, it depends on other things: business needs for cargo shipments, business passenger demand, leisure passenger demand, all influenced by macroeconomic activity in the markets under study. These patterns are highly seasonal, and often day-of-week, time-of-day, and even directionally variable.

* Notwithstanding these demand patterns, the overall trend of demand has been consistently increasing. In the [[1950s|1950's]] and [[1960s|1960's]], annual growth rates of 15% or more were common. Annual growth of 5-6% persisted through the [[1980s|1980's]] and [[1990s|1990's]]. Growth rates are not consistent in all regions, but certainly areas where deregulation provided more competition and greater pricing freedom resulted in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth. The [[United States|U.S.]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], and other markets exhibited this trend.

* The industry is cyclical. Four or five years of poor performance are followed by five or six years of gradually improving good performance. But profitability in the good years is generally low, in the range of 2-3% net profit after interest and tax. It is in this time that airlines begin paying for new generations of airplanes and other service upgrades they ordered to respond to the increased demand. Since 1980, the industry as a whole has not even earned back the cost of capital during the best of times. Conversely, in bad times losses can be dramatically worse.

* As in many mature industries, consolidation is a trend, as airlines form new business combinations, ranging from loose, limited bilateral partnerships to long-term, multi-faceted alliances of groups of companies, to equity arrangements between companies, to actual [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]] or [[Takeover|takeovers]]. Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries, we see most consolidation taking place within a country. In the U.S., over 200 airlines have been merged, taken over, or simply gone out of business since deregulation began in [[1978]]. Many international airline managers are actively lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation, in order to achieve higher economies of scale and greater efficiencies.

===Early development of airlines in the U.S.===
Following [[World War I]], the United States found itself swamped with aviators. Many decided to take their war-surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns, performing acrobatic maneuvers to woo crowds. In [[1918]], the [[United States Postal Service]] won the financial backing of [[Congress]] to begin experimenting with [[air mail]] service, initially using [[Curtiss Jenny]] aircraft that had been procured by the [[United States Army]] for reconnaissance missions on the Western Front. The Army was the first to fly these missions, but quickly lost the contract when they proved to be too unreliable. By the mid-[[1920s]], the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] had developed its own air mail network, based on a transcontinental backbone between [[New York, New York|New York]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. To supplant this service, they offered twelve contracts for spur routes to independent bidders: the carriers that won these routes would, through time and mergers, evolve into [[Braniff Airlines]], [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]] (originally a division of [[Boeing]]), [[Trans World Airlines]], [[Northwest Airlines]], and [[Eastern Airlines]], to name a few.

Passenger service during the early 1920s was sporadic at best: most airlines at the time were focused on carrying bags of mail. In 1925, however, [[Ford Motor Company]] bought out the Stout Aircraft Company and began construction of the all-metal [[Ford Trimotor]], the first successful American airliner. With a 12-passenger capacity, it made passenger service potentially profitable. Air service was seen as a supplement to [[rail transport|rail]] service in the American transportation network.

At the same time, [[Juan Trippe]] began a crusade to create an air network that would link America to the world, and he achieved this goal through his airline, [[Pan American World Airways]], with a fleet of flying boats that linked [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] to [[Shanghai]] and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to [[London]]. Pan Am was the only U.S. airline to go international before the 1940s, and quickly became a symbol of the potential of the American airline industry.

With the introduction of the [[Boeing 247]] and [[Douglas DC-3]] in the 1930s, the U.S. airline industry was generally profitable, even during the [[Great Depression]]. This trend continued until the beginning of [[World War II]].

===Early development of airlines in Europe===
[[Image:National Audit Office - Victoria - London - 020504.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Imperial Airways Empire Terminal, Victoria, [[London]]. Trains ran from here to [[flying boats]] in [[Southampton]], and to [[Croydon Airport]].]]
The first countries in Europe to embrace air transport were [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]].  

In [[1919]] [[KLM]] was founded, still the oldest carrier operating under its original name. The first flight transported two English passengers to [[Schiphol]], [[Amsterdam]] from [[London]] in [[1920]]. Like other major European airlines of the time (see France and the UK below), KLM's early growth depended heavily on the needs to service links with far-flung colonial possessions ([[Dutch Indies]]). It is only after the loss of the [[Dutch Empire]] that [[KLM]] found itself based at a small country with few potential passengers, depending heavily on transfer traffic, and was one of the first to introduce the hub-system to facilitate easy connections.

France began an air mail service to [[Morocco]] in [[1919]] that was bought out in [[1927]], renamed [[Aéropostale (aviation)|Aéropostale]], and injected with capital to become a major international carrier. In [[1933]], Aéropostale went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]], was nationalized and merged with several other airlines into what became [[Air France]].

The German airline industry began with [[Lufthansa]] in [[1926]], which, unlike most other airlines at the time, became a major investor in airlines outside of Europe, founding [[Varig]] and [[Avianca]]. German airliners built by [[Junkers]], [[Dornier GmbH|Dornier]], and [[Fokker]] were the most advanced in the world at the time. The peak of German air travel came in the mid-[[1930s]], when [[Nazi]] propaganda ministers approved the start of commercial [[zeppelin]] service: the big [[airship]]s were a symbol of industrial might, but the fact that they used flammable hydrogen gas raised safety concerns that culminated with the [[Hindenburg]] disaster of [[1937]].

[[United Kingdom]]'s flag carrier during this period was [[Imperial Airways]], which became [[BOAC]] (British Overseas Airlines Co.) in [[1939]]. Imperial Airways used huge [[Handley-Page]] [[biplane]]s for routes between [[London]], the [[Middle East]], and [[India]]: images of Imperial aircraft in the middle of the [[Rub'al Khali]], being maintained by [[Bedouin]]s, are among the most famous pictures from the heyday of the [[British Empire]].

===Development of airlines post-1945===
As governments met to set the standards and scope for an emergent civil air industry toward the end of the war, it was no surprise that the U.S. took a position of maximum operating freedom. After all, U.S. airline companies were not devastated by the war, as European companies and the few Asian companies had been. This preference for &quot;open skies&quot; operating regimes continues, within limitations, to this day.

World War II, like World War I, brought new life to the airline industry. Many airlines in the Allied countries were flush from lease contracts to the military, and foresaw a future explosive demand for civil air transport, for both passengers and cargo. They were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the [[Boeing Stratocruiser]], [[Lockheed Constellation]], and [[Douglas DC-6]]. Most of these new aircraft were based on American bombers such as the [[B-29]], which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as [[pressurization]]. Most offered increased efficiency from both added speed and greater payload.

In the 1950s, the [[De Havilland Comet]], [[Boeing 707]], [[Douglas DC-8]], and [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] became the first flagships of the Jet Age in the West, while the [[Soviet Union]] bloc countered with the [[Tupolev Tu-104]] and [[Tupolev Tu-124]] in the fleets of state-owned carriers such as [[Aeroflot]] and [[Interflug]]. The [[Vickers Viscount]] and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] inaugurated turboprop transport.

The next big boost for the airlines would come in the 1970s, when the [[Boeing 747]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], and [[Lockheed L-1011]] inaugurated widebody (&quot;jumbo jet&quot;) service, which is still the standard in international travel. The [[Tupolev Tu-144]] and its Western counterpart, [[Concorde]], made supersonic travel a reality. In 1972, [[Airbus]] began producing Europe's most commercially successful line of airliners to date. The added efficiencies for these aircraft were often not in speed, but in passenger capacity, payload, and range. 

With deregulation in the U.S. beginning in 1978, barriers to entry were lowered for new entrants. Typically, a new wave of start-ups would enter during downturns in the normal 8-10 year business cycle. At that time, they find aircraft, financing, hangar and maintenance services, training all relatively inexpensive, and laid off staff from other companies eager and willing to take a job with the new company.

Alas, as the business cycle returned to normalcy, major airlines were able to dominate their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings, often swamping the new startup. Only [[America West Airlines]] (now known as USAirways) has remained as a significant survivor from this new entrant era, as dozens, even hundreds, have gone under.

In many ways, the biggest winner in the deregulated environment was the air passenger. Indeed, the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel, as many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining [[frequent flyer]] loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, for almost any points in the country. Air travel's advantages put intercity bus lines under pressure, and most have withered away. 

By the 1980's, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.

Toward the end of the century, a new style of [[low-cost carrier|low cost airline]] was seen, offering a consistent, often high-quality product, using new aircraft models, at a price that was well-received. [[JetBlue]], [[AirTran Airways]], and other companies represented a serious challenge to legacy carriers, as their counterparts in Europe, Canada, and Asia did to legacy carriers in those regions. Their commercial viability also represented a serious cost threat to employees at legacy airlines, as they set the standard for wage rates in the industry that were a fraction of the prevailing wage. 

Thus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region. Today, airlines representing approximately one-half of total U.S. seat capacity are operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy provisions.

==Regulatory considerations==
===Government regulation===
[[image:airindia.longshot.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Air India]] [[Boeing 747-400]]]]

Many countries have [[national airline]]s that are owned and operated by the government. Even fully privatized airlines are subject to a great deal of government regulation for economic, political, and safety concerns. Airline labor actions, for instance, are often halted by government intervention in order to protect the free flow of people, communications, and goods between different regions without compromising safety.

The United States, Australia, and to a lesser extent Brazil, Mexico, the European Union, and Japan have &quot;deregulated&quot; their airlines. In the past, these governments dictated airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand. 

The entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets, and average fares tend to drop 20% or more, spurring new sources of demand. The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base. 

As a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines. These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business, in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants.

===International regulation===
[[image:singapore.b747.london.750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Singapore Airlines]] [[Boeing 747]].]]

Groups such as the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] establish worldwide standards for safety and other vital concerns. Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes. The model of such an agreement was the [[Bermuda Agreement]] between the US and UK following World War II, which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes.

Bilateral agreements are based on the &quot;[[freedoms of the air]],&quot; a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country (a very rarely granted right known as [[cabotage]]). Most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country: some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to a third country, or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas.

In the 1990s, &quot;[[open skies]]&quot; agreements became more common, which take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. Open skies agreements have met some criticism, particularly within the [[European Union]], whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because of cabotage restrictions.

==Economic considerations==
Although many countries continue to operate state-owned or parastatal airlines, most large airlines today are privately-owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles in order to maximize shareholder profit.

===Financing===
Airline financing is quite complex, since airlines are highly leveraged operations. Not only must they purchase (or lease) new airline bodies and engines regularly, they must make major long-term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain. Compare [[Southwest Airlines]] and their reliance on a single airplane type (the [[Boeing]] 737 and derivatives), with the now bankrupt [[Eastern Airlines]] which operated 17 different aircraft types, each with varying pilot, engine, maintenance, and support needs.

A second financial issue is that of hedging [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[fuel]] purchases, usually second only to labor in its relative cost to the company but with the fuel price touching $70/barrel it has become biggest part of total airlines expenses.While [[hedging instruments]] can be expensive, they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs, such as in the 2000-2005 period.

===Operating costs===
In a mature industry with low fare new entrants and tiny operating margins, it is imperative that airline managers identify controllable costs.

Full-service airlines have a high level of fixed and operating costs in order to establish and maintain air services: labor, fuel, airplanes, engines, spares and parts, IT services and networks, airport equipment, airport handling services, sales distribution, catering, training, insurance, and other costs. Thus all but a few cents on the dollar in ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers.

Moreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed however due to a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes, and surcharges they have little or no control over, and these are passed through to various providers. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the originating country.

Analysis of the 1992-1996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales. While airlines as a whole earned 6% return on capital employed (2-3.5% less than the cost of capital), airports earned 10%, catering companies 10-13%, handling companies 11-14%, aircraft lessors 15%, aircraft manufacturers 16%, and global distribution companies more than 30%. (Source: Spinetta, 2000, quoted in Doganis, 2002)

In contrast, [[Southwest Airlines]] has been the most profitable of airline companies since 1970. Indeed, some sources have calculated Southwest to be the best performing stock over the period, outperforming [[Microsoft]] and many other high performing companies. The chief reasons for this are their product consistency and cost control.

The widespread entrance of a new breed of low cost airlines beginning at the turn of the century has accelerated the demand that full service carriers control costs. Many of these low cost companies emulate [[Southwest Airlines]] in various respects, and like Southwest, they are able to eke out a consistent profit throughout all phases of the business cycle. 

As a result, a shakeout of airlines is occurring in the U.S. and elsewhere. [[United Airlines]], [[US Airways]] (twice), [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[Northwest Airlines]] have all declared [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy, and [[American Airlines|American]] has barely avoided doing so. [[Alitalia]], [[Scandinavian Airlines System]], [[SABENA]], [[Japan Air System]], [[Air Canada]], [[Ansett Australia]], and others have flirted with or declared bankruptcy since 2000, as low cost entrants enter their home markets as well. Some argue that it would be far better for the industry as a whole if a wave of actual closures were to reduce the number of &quot;undead&quot; airlines competing with healthy airlines while being artificially protected from creditors via [[bankruptcy]] law.

===Ticket sales===
Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. To do this well requires [[yield management]] technology and pricing flexibility. 

They use differentiated pricing, a form of [[price discrimination]], in order to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the current booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day. 

A complicating factor is that of origin-destination control (&quot;O&amp;D control&quot;). Someone purchasing a ticket from say, Melbourne to Sydney for $A200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same airplane, and who is willing to pay $A1400. Should the airline prefer the $A1400 passenger, or the $A200 passenger + a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $A1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily in their markets.

In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer straightforward, preannounced, simple prices. They can do this by quoting prices for each leg of a trip; passengers simply add them together to construct a full journey. 

The advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late 1970s, most notably [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], allowed airlines to easily perform [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit analyses]] on different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere). The intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term &quot;[[fare war]]&quot; to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes.

Computers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for &quot;no-shows,&quot; but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats. Since an average of 1/3 of all seats are flown empty, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with overbooking on high demand flights can help reduce this figure.

===Airport operations===
Where an airline has established an engineering base at an airport then there may be considerable economic advantages in using that same airport as a preferred focus (or &quot;hub&quot;) for its scheduled flights.   

In view of the congestion apparent at many international [[airport|airports]], the ownership of slots at certain airports (the right to take-off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night) has become a significant tradeable asset in the portfolios of many airlines. Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline. If a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper.  Other factors, such as surface transport facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway. 

===Business-to-business relations===
[[Code sharing]] is the most common type of airline partnership; it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline's flights under its own airline code. An early example of this was [[Japan Airlines]]' code sharing partnership with [[Aeroflot]] in the 1960s on flights from [[Tokyo]] to [[Moscow]]: Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft. 

Since airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as &quot;show me flights from Chicago to Dusseldorf&quot;), an airline who is able to code share with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago-Dusseldorf flight. The passenger is advised however, that Airline 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and Airline 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to Dusseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms so as to increase sales.

Virtually all international airlines practice code sharing.

A more recent development is the [[airline alliance]], which became prevalent in the 1990s. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. Groups of airlines such as the [[Star Alliance]], [[oneworld]], and [[SkyTeam]] coordinate their passenger service programs (such as lounges and frequent flyer programs), offer special interline tickets, and often engage in extensive codesharing (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinations-- sometimes including cross-equity arrangements-- in which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was [[KLM]], who partnered with [[Northwest Airlines]]. Both airlines later entered the [[SkyTeam]] alliance after the fusion of KLM and [[Air France]] in 2004.

Often the companies combine IT operations, buy fuel, or purchase airplanes as a bloc in order to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.

==Customs and conventions==
Each operator of a scheduled or charter flight uses a distinct [[airline call sign]] when communicating with airports or air traffic control centers. Most of these call-signs are derived from the airline's trade name, but for reasons of history, marketing, or the need to reduce ambiguity in spoken English (so that pilots do not mistakenly make navigational decisions based on instructions issued to a different aircraft), some airlines and air forces use call-signs less obviously connected with their trading name. For example, British Airways uses a ''Speedbird'' call-sign, named after the logo of its predecessor, [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]].

== Airline personnel ==
The various types of airline personnel include:
*[[Flight crew]]s, responsible for the operation of aircraft while airborne. Flight crew members include:
** [[Aviator|Pilot]]s ([[captain]] and [[first officer]]: some older aircraft also require [[flight engineer]]s and/or [[navigator]]s)
** [[Flight attendant]]s (led by a [[purser]] on larger aircraft)
** [[Sky marshal|In-flight security personnel]] on some airlines (most notably [[El Al]])
*[[Ground crew]]s, responsible for operations at airports. Ground crew members include:
**[[Airframe]] and [[powerplant]] technicians
**[[Avionics]] technicians
**[[Flight dispatcher]]s
**Baggage handlers
**Rampers
**Gate agents
**Ticket agents
**Passenger service agents (such as [[airline lounge]] employees)
*Reservations agents, usually (but not always) at facilities outside the airport

Most airlines follow a [[corporation|corporate]] structure where each broad area of operations (such as maintenance, flight operations, and passenger service) is supervised by a vice president. Larger airlines often appoint vice presidents to oversee each of the airline's hubs as well. Airlines also tend to employ considerable numbers of lawyers to deal with regulatory procedures and other administrative tasks.

The '''Australian Democrats''' (in regular parlance, just the '''Democrats'''), is an [[Australia|Australian]] social [[liberal parties|liberal party]] formed in 1977 from the earlier [[Australia Party]] by [[Don Chipp]], who left the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] to do so. His stated aim was to &quot;Keep the Bastards Honest&quot; (the &quot;bastards&quot; being politicians in general). Despite its name (and the name of the rival and [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]] [[Liberal Party of Australia]]), the Australian Democrats can be considered the counterpart of European [[liberal parties]]. After a poor performance at the [[Australian legislative election, 2004|2004 federal election]], the Australian Democrats' future as a political force is in question.

==Policy==
The party's original support base was disaffected middle-class traditional Liberal voters from the centre-right Liberal Party's socially liberal, &quot;wet&quot; wing. The party aimed to combine liberal social policies with centrist economics. However, the major parties, including the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]], have moved to the right on economics since the early 1980s, shifting the 'centre' of Australian politics well to the right. Thus the  Democrats have come to be seen as leaning to the left on economic as well as social issues. 

The Democrats' agenda includes [[economic interventionism|interventionist economic]] policies, commitment to [[environmentalism|environmental]] causes, support for [[reconciliation]] with Australia's [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous population]] through such mechanisms as formal treaties, [[pacifism|pacifist]] approaches to international relations, and [[left-wing]] approaches to social issues such as sexuality and drugs, and constitutional and treaty protections for [[human rights]]. Its core support base is overwhelmingly [[tertiary education|tertiary-educated]], and [[middle class|middle-class]]. They also explicitly target voters who seek a brake on the powers of the government of the day to change things, with their long-term hold on the Senate balance of power.

The party has a platform of participatory democracy, with policies supporting [[proportional representation]] and [[citizen initiated referendum|citizens' initated referenda]]. Many important internal issues (such as electoral preselection and leadership) are decided by direct postal ballot of the membership. Although policies are theoretically set in a similar fashion, Democrat parliamentarians have extensive freedom in interpreting them.

==Support==
Support for the Democrats historically tended to fluctuate between about 5 and 10 percent of the population and was geographically concentrated around the wealthy dense [[Central Business District|urban neighbourhoods]] (known in Australia as the [[Central business district|&quot;inner-suburbs and CBD&quot;]]) of the [[Australian capital cities|capital cities]] (especially [[Adelaide, Australia|Adelaide]]). Therefore, they never managed to win a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] seat (despite coming close on a number of occasions). During the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s they typically held one or two of the Federal [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in each state, as well as a handful of representatives in state parliaments and local councils.

However, the rise of the Greens and internal bickering in the early 2000s changed this, and the Democrats are now in heavy decline - receiving 1.24% nationally, and less than 3% of the vote at all but a handful of booths, even in their Adelaide heartland. Their voters are turning to the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] (to the right) and [[Australian Greens|Greens]] (to the left) in almost equal numbers.

==Leadership==
The Democrats are notable for their willingness to elect female and [[Indigenous Australian]] parliamentary leadership. Of the party's ten leaders, six have been women. Aboriginal Senator [[Aden Ridgeway]] was deputy leader under Natasha Stott Despoja.

The leaders of the Australian Democrats have been:

* [[Don Chipp]] (1977-1986)
* [[Janine Haines]] (1986-1990)
* [[Janet Powell]] (1990-91)
* [[John Coulter]] (1991-93)
* [[Cheryl Kernot]] (1993-97)
* [[Meg Lees]] (1997-2001)
* [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] ([[6 April]] [[2001]] to [[21 August]] [[2002]])
* [[Brian Greig]] (2002)
* [[Andrew Bartlett]] (2002-2004)
* [[Lyn Allison]] (2004-present)

[[Andrew Bartlett]] is currently deputy leader.

==A short history==
In terms of percentage votes, the Democrats' electoral peak was probably the 1990 federal election.  The failure of then-leader Janine Haines to win a [[Division of Kingston|House of Representatives seat]] led to a leadership change; her successor, Janet Powell, was too radical for many in the party and lacked electoral appeal.  After an affair with another Senator, she lost the support of much of the caucus. These internal divisions damaged the party in the early 1990s, although recovery occurred under Cheryl Kernot.

During the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating|Keating]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Governments (1983-96), which pursued [[economic rationalism|economic rationalist]] [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies, the Democrats positioned themselves to the left of the ALP government and thus at the left end of mainstream Australian politics.  However, the party's progressive-liberal politics remained attractive to middle class [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] supporters who were disaffected by the Liberal party's social conservatism (&quot;wet&quot; Liberals).

After the election of the [[John Howard|Howard]] government in 1996, this philosophical division became apparent; there was no longer a single obvious location for the party on the political spectrum.  The left of the party was horrified by John Howard's policies, and wanted to undermine and block them whenever possible.  Others wanted to engage with the government, using the Senate balance of power to negotiate with it and moderate its legislation. The question was whether the Democrats should be a centrist party, at least on economics, (though socially liberal and environmentalist), ready in most cases to negotiate with the government of the day whether Liberal or Labor (the position suggested by the party's &quot;wet Liberal&quot; roots) or a left-wing party, to the left of both mainstream parties on economic as well as social policy, in strong and consistent opposition to the Liberals and willing to take an obstructionist approach in the Senate to the Howard government's legislative program (a position on the political spectrum more similar to the [[Australian Greens|Greens]]). 

This conflict manifested itself in tensions over Cheryl Kernot's policy on [[industrial relations]] (see the [[Workplace Relations Act]] of 1996). Under Kernot, after negotiations and some compromises from the government, the Democrats voted for the Howard Government's right-leaning industrial relations legislation which decreased union power and allowed a larger role for individual employer-employee contracts. Kernot, however, remained both ambitious and broadly opposed to the Liberal government. This, together with her personal ambition for a role in government, lead her to defect to the ALP in 1997. Initially both Labor and the Democrats benefitted from Kernot's move, with polls showing that the Democrats had attracted a significant &quot;sympathy vote&quot;. In the [[Australian legislative election, 1998|1998 federal election]], the Democrats came within 3% of taking Liberal Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]]'s seat of [[Division of Mayo|Mayo]] in the Adelaide Hills under Australia's [[Preferential voting|preferential voting]] system.

Internal conflict over the government's proposed [[Goods and Services Tax]] (GST), during the 1998 federal election and in Parliament in 1999 was extremely damaging to the Democrats. Meg Lees campaigned on a modified GST platform, opposing the GST on food and books. After negotiations with Prime Minister [[John Howard|Howard]], Meg Lees and Andrew Murray (both part of the centrist element within the Democrats) agreed to support the GST legislation with exemptions for most food and some medicines. Many left-wing Democrat voters and a large number of party members regarded this as a betrayal, and two senators on the party's left, [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] and [[Andrew Bartlett]], voted against the GST. 

After very poor state election results in 2001, Lees was replaced by the articulate young left-leaning senator, [[Natasha Stott Despoja]]. Stott Despoja worked hard to bring dissafected former Democrat voters back in the 2001 federal election, although she was not able to bring back enough voters to prevent the loss of a seat to Greens Senator [[Kerry Nettle]], indicating the loss of Democrat votes on the left. (The task was not made any easier by the [[Tampa affair]].) Ongoing tensions between Stott Despoja and Lees (who quit the party in 2002, but was supported by some of the Senators, nicknamed the [[Gang of Four (disambiguation)|Gang of Four]] by the media) forced a protracted leadership battle in 2002, which eventually led to the election of Senator Andrew Bartlett as leader. However, the tension led to [[Meg Lees]] leaving the party and becoming an independent, which deprived the Democrats of the balance of power in the Senate and greatly lessened their relevance and media exposure. 

Since the decision to support the GST in 1999, and especially after the very public infighting in 2002, the Democrats have suffered a severe decline in public support. Although the left-right division within the parliamentary party and between the parliamentary party and the grass roots membership has existed for many years, the recent leadership battles have created bitterness within the party, and exposed the disunity to public scrutiny. With the [[Australian Greens]] picking up many of their voters on the left, and some voters from the centre returning to the Liberals, the Democrats are facing their greatest crisis to date. 

At the height of the disunity in 2002, most political observers believed that the party would soon split or disappear as a serious force in Australian politics. Under Senator Bartlett's leadership the Democrats found a degree of stability and an end to public feuding, but they have made little progress toward recovering their traditional share of electoral support and are now largely ignored by the media. 

On [[6 December]] [[2003]], Andrew Bartlett stepped aside temporarily as leader of the party, after an incident in which he assaulted [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Senator [[Jeannie Ferris]] on the floor of [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] while intoxicated. The party issued a statement stating that Deputy Leader [[Lyn Allison]] would serve as the Acting Leader of the party.  Bartlett apologised to the Democrats, Jeannie Ferris and the Australian public for his behaviour and assured all concerned that it would never happen again. On [[January 29]] [[2004]], after seeking medical treatment, Bartlett returned to the Democrats leadership. Andrew Bartlett has not consumed any alcohol since that incident.

Almost totally ignored by the media during the election campaign, the Democrats suffered a massive loss of support at the [[Australian legislative election, 2004|2004 Federal election]], reducing them to 1.24% of the national vote. Nowhere was this more noticeable than in their key support base of suburban [[Adelaide]], where they received between 7 and 31% of the Lower House vote at polling booths in 2001, and between 1% and 4% in 2004. None of their Senators up for re-election survived the vote. Most electoral analysts concluded that, while most of the party's left-wing support had gone to the Greens (who now had an equal number of Senate seats with the Democrats and seemed to have taken their place as the leading minor party), many of the party's centrist middle-class voters from a 'wet Liberal' background had returned to the Liberal Party, helping the Howard Government to win a majority in the Senate, the first government to do so for a quarter of a century. With their Senate numbers almost halved, the Democrats face complete annihilation at the next election if the 2004 result is repeated. 

Following the loss, Bartlett stated that he would not stand down, but in the following month swapped positions with Allison, with Allison becoming the new leader and Bartlett the deputy. However, Allison, like Bartlett, has failed to gain any real media exposure or to increase the party's support in opinion polls.  

On [[1 July]] [[2005]] the Democrats lost most of their remaining parliamentary influence when the senators elected in 2004 were sworn in, giving the governing Coalition outright control of the Senate. On [[5 January]] [[2006]], the ABC reported that the State Electoral Commission of Tasmania had deregistered that branch of the party for failing to provide a list of members.

The '''Australian Capital Territory''' ('''ACT''') is the [[capital territory]] of the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]] and its smallest, but most populous, self-governing territory. It is an inland [[enclave]] in [[New South Wales]], situated in [[bush]]land.

The ACT was conceived during the federation conventions of the late 1800s as neutral location for a new National Capital. The [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provided that following [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901, land would be ceded to the new [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]]. The Territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by the state of [[New South Wales]] in 1911, and construction of the capital, [[Canberra]], began in 1913. 

The [[floral emblem]] of the ACT is the [[Wahlenbergia gloriosa|Royal Bluebell]] and the faunal emblem is the [[Gang-gang cockatoo]].

==History==
{{main|History of the Australian Capital Territory}}
Before European settlement the area now known as the ACT was inhabited by three [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal tribes]]: the [[Ngunnawal people|Ngunnawal]], [[Walgalu]], and [[Ngarigo]].

White exploration and settlement did not occur until the [[1820s]]. From 1824 onwards, settlements and homesteads, and ultimately some small townships such as [[Hall, Australian Capital Territory|Hall]] and [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]], were established in the area. 

One homestead of special historical interest was Lambrigg, near Tharwa. This was the place in which [[William Farrer]] developed the [[rust (fungus)|rust]]-resistant Federation [[wheat]] strain that had a major beneficial effect on Australia's wheat industry. Farrer died at Lambrigg in 1906.  

When the [[Constitution of Australia|constitution]] for the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] was being negotiated between the colonies, [[Melbourne]] was nominated as the Capital city of Australia, however, [[Sydney]] disputed this and wanted to become the capital. To cease the dispute created by [[Sydney]] a new capital city would be built. When finally decided, the Constitution specified that the new capital city would be located in territory taken from [[New South Wales]], but be at least 100 [[statute miles]] from Sydney.

The present site was chosen in 1908{{ref|GovAct1908}}, with additional territory at [[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]] (now a naval base on the NSW coast) allocated so the national capital could have a seaport. In 1909 New South Wales transferred the land for the territory to federal control and in 1910 an act of parliament created the legal framework for the territory{{ref|SeatofGov1909}}{{ref|SeatGovAct1910}}. The Minister for Home Affairs, [[King O'Malley]], who had charge of the legislation creating the ACT, also proposed a bill making the ACT an alcohol-free area.  With his strong support, the bill became law later that year. In 1911 an international design competition was held, which was won by [[Walter Burley Griffin]]. The official naming of Canberra and its official construction began on [[March 12]], [[1913]].

The seat of the Federal Government officially moved to the ACT from Melbourne on the formal opening of the [[Provisional Parliament House]] on [[9 May]] [[1927]]. Among the first acts passed by the parliament in its new location was the repealing of the prohibition laws. At first the public service continued to be based in Melbourne, but the various departments were gradually moved to Canberra over many years.

The territory was initially known as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). In 1938, the territory was formally named the Australian Capital Territory.

In a 1978 referendum, Canberrans rejected self-government by 63% of the vote {{ref|PatWACT}}.  Despite this, in December 1988, the ACT was granted full self-government through an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament that made the ACT a body politic under the crown{{ref|SelfGovAct1988}}. Following the first elections in February 1989, a 17-member Legislative Assembly sat at its offices in London Circuit, Civic, on [[May 11]], [[1989]]. The [[Australian Labor Party]] formed the ACT's first government, led by the Chief Minister [[Rosemary Follett]], who made history as Australia's first female head of government.

==Geography==
[[Image:ACT-Jervis Bay-Sydney-MJC.png|left|thumb|125px|Location of the ACT and Jervis Bay]]
Apart from [[Canberra]] city, the Australian Capital Territory also contains agricultural land ([[domestic sheep|sheep]], [[dairy cattle]], [[vineyard]]s and a small amount of crops), and a large area of national park ([[Namadgi National Park]]), much of it mountainous and forested. Small townships and communities located within the ACT include Williamsdale, Naas, [[Uriarra, Australian Capital Territory|Uriarra]], [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]] and [[Hall, Australian Capital Territory|Hall]].

Tidbinbilla is a locality to the south-west of Canberra that features the [[Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve]] and the [[Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex]], operated by [[NASA]] as part of its [[Deep Space Network]].

There are a large range of mountains, rivers and creeks in the Namadgi National Park. These include the Naas and Murrumbidgee Rivers.

In 1915 the ''[[Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915]]'' created the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] as an annexe to the Australian Capital Territory. In 1988 when the ACT gained self-government, Jervis Bay became a separate territory administered by the Minister for Territories.

===Climate===
Because of its elevation and distance from the coast, the Australian Capital Territory experiences four distinct seasons, unlike many other Australian cities whose climates are moderated by the sea. Canberra is notorious for hot, dry summers, and cold winters with heavy [[fog]] and frequent [[frost]]s. Many of the higher mountains in the territory's south-east are snow covered for at least part of the winter. [[Thunderstorm]]s can occur between October and March, and annual rainfall is 623&amp;nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]], with rainfall maximums in spring and summer and minimum in winter.

'''Highest maximum temperature:''' 42.2&amp;nbsp;°C (108.0&amp;nbsp;°F), [[Canberra]], [[1 February]] [[1968]]

'''Lowest minimum temperature:''' -10.0&amp;nbsp;°C (14.0&amp;nbsp;°F), [[Canberra]], [[11 July]] [[1971]]

===Geology===
{{main|Natural history of the Australian Capital Territory}}
Notable geological formations in the Australian Capital Territory include the ''Canberra Formation'', the ''Pittman Formation'', ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' and ''State Circle Shale''.

In the 1840s [[fossil]]s of [[brachiopod]]s and [[trilobite]]s from the [[Silurian]] period were discovered at Woolshed Creek near [[Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory|Duntroon]]. At the time these where the oldest fossils discovered in Australia, though this record has now been far surpassed.{{ref|Woolshedheritage}} Other specific geological places of interest include the State Circle cutting and the Deakin anticline.{{ref|StateCircleCutting}}{{ref|DeakinAnticlineNT}}

The oldest rocks in the ACT date from the [[Ordovician]] around 480 million years ago. During this period the region along with most of Eastern Australia was part of the ocean floor; formations from this period include the ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' formation and the ''Pittman Formation'' consisting largely of [[quartz]]-rich [[sandstone]], [[siltstone]] and [[shale]]. These formations became exposed when the ocean floor was raised by a major [[orogeny|volcanic activity]] in the [[Devonian]] forming much of the east coast of Australia.

==Governance==
{{see also|Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly}}
[[Image:ACT Legislative Assembly.JPG|thumb|The ACT Legislative Assembly building]]
The ACT has internal self-government, but it does not have the legislative independence of the Australian states. It is governed by a Ministry headed by a Chief Minister (currently [[Jon Stanhope]], [[ALP|Australian Labor Party]]). Laws are made in a 17-member [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] that has all state and local government functions. However, its decisions can be overruled by the Australian Government under section 122 of the [[Australian Constitution]]. (See also [[Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories]]). The ACT Government is a member of the [[Council of Australian Governments]].

Unlike other self-governing Australian territories (e.g. [[Norfolk Island]], [[Northern Territory]]), the ACT does not have an Administrator. The Crown is represented by the [[Governor-General of Australia]] in the government of the ACT.

In Australia's [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]], the ACT is represented by four members: two [[Australian Senate|Senators]], and two members of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]; the [[Division of Fraser]] and the [[Division of Canberra]].

==Demographics==
In the 2001 census the population of the ACT was 311,947, of which only 429 were outside Canberra. The ACT median weekly income for people aged over 15 was in the range $500-$599 while the population living outside Canberra was at the national average of $300-$399. The average level of education in the ACT is significantly higher than the national average. Within the ACT 4% of the population have a postgraduate degree compared to just 1.4% in the whole of Australia.

==Education==
{{main|Education in the Australian Capital Territory}}
[[Image:Canberra school of art.JPG|right|thumb|[[Australian National University|ANU]] school of art, originally built as Canberra High School]]
Almost all educational institutions in the Australian Capital Territory are located within [[Canberra]]. The ACT public education system schooling is normally split up into [[Pre-School]], [[Primary School]] (K-6), [[High School]] (7-10) and [[College#Australia|College]] (11-12) followed by studies at [[university]] or [[TAFE]]. Many private high schools include years 11 and 12 and are referred to as colleges.

In February 2004 there were 140 [[List of schools in the Australian Capital Territory|public and non-governmental schools]] in Canberra; 96 were operated by the Government and 44 are non-Government.{{ref|ABSACTSchools}} In 2005 there where 60,275 students in the ACT school system. 59.3% of the students where enrolled in government schools with the remaining 40.7% in non-government schools. There where 30,995 students in primary school, 19,211 in high school, 9,429 in College and a further 340 in special schools. {{ref|ACTenrolments}}

As of May 2004, 30% of people in the ACT aged 15&amp;ndash;64 had a level of educational attainment equal to at least an [[bachelor's degree]], significantly higher that the national average of 19%. {{ref|2004Education}} The two main tertiary institutions are the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) in [[Acton, Australian Capital Territory|Acton]] and the [[University of Canberra]] (UC) in [[Bruce, Australian Capital Territory|Bruce]]. There are also two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou is a campus of the [[Australian Catholic University]] and St Mark's Theological College is a campus of [[Charles Sturt University]]. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus [[Canberra Institute of Technology]].

The [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] (ADFA) and the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] (RMC) are in the suburb of [[Campbell, Australian Capital Territory|Campbell]] in Canberra's inner northeast. ADFA teaches [[military]] [[undergraduate]]s and [[Quaternary education|postgraduate]]s and is officially a [[campus]] of the [[University of New South Wales]] while Duntroon provides [[Australian Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|Officer]] [[training]].

'''''Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs''''' was a popular [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]], distributed by [[Warner Bros.]], and produced by [[Amblin Entertainment]]. The cartoon, usually referred to by the shorter title '''''Animaniacs''''', first aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] from [[1993]] until [[1995]]; the show appeared on [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] as part of its &quot;Kids' WB&quot; afternoon programming block from [[1995]] to [[1998]]. Like many other animated series, it has continued to appear on television through [[Television syndication|syndication]] long after its original airdate.

''Animaniacs'' was the second animated series produced by the collaboration of [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]] during the [[Modern animation of the United States|animation renaissance]] of the [[1990s]].  The studio's first series, ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]],'' had proved to be a big hit among younger viewing audiences, and it had attracted a sizable number of adult viewers as well.  ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' had drawn heavily from the classic [[Termite Terrace]] cartoons of old for inspiration, as well as plots and characterization.  The modern Warner Bros. writers and animators used the experience gained from the previous series to create brand new animated characters that were cast in the mold of [[Tex Avery]]'s and [[Bob Clampett]]'s creations, but were not slavish imitations.

The show itself was a [[variety show]], with many short skits featuring a large cast of unique characters. Each episode was traditionally composed of three short mini-episodes, each starring a different set of characters.

== The Animaniacs: the Warner Brothers (and the Warner Sister) ==
This show focused on the adventures, or more accurately, misadventures of the [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot|Warner Bros. (Yakko and Wakko Warner) and the Warner Sister (Dot)]], who claim to be the stars of some of the early Warner Bros. [[animated cartoon]]s, which were so [[insane]] that the studio execs locked them away in the [[water tower]] at Warner Bros. Studios in [[Burbank, California]].  This description of the Warners is a tongue-in-cheek homage to [[Bosko]], Warner Bros.' first cartoon character, whose cartoons were not highly regarded by many people.

The red-nosed Warner siblings bear a striking resemblance to the portrayals of Bosko and his girlfriend Honey (who look remarkably like Dot and Yakko) in a 1990 episode of ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' entitled ''Fields of Honey'', also created by Steven Spielberg. Afraid that the portrayals of Bosko and Honey might be deemed controversial, they were changed to anthropomorphic doglike characters, and that episode served as the &quot;bridge&quot; between ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' and ''Animaniacs''.

Originally, the Warners were intended to be [[ducks]], but producer [[Tom Ruegger]] realized they'd been done enough by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] (see ''[[DuckTales]]''), so he made them indeterminate children.  He also modeled their personalities a bit after his three sons (who all did voices on the series at one time or another).

== ''Animaniacs'' characters ==
''Animaniacs'' introduced a number of recurring characters, including:

* [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot]] - the &quot;Warner Brothers&quot; (and the Warner Sister), voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]], [[Jess Harnell]], and [[Tress MacNeille]].  Yakko (the oldest) is a fast-talking smart aleck, reminiscent at times of [[Groucho Marx]].  Wakko (the middle child) has a huge appetite and a gaggy bag filled with tricks (and an accent oddly reminiscent of [[Ringo Starr]]), and Dot (the youngest) is cute and sassy, and uses her apparent innocence to manipulate and torment those who stand in her way. The Warners are some of the few characters that actually appear in all the short skits, usually being chased by Ralph. Most other characters are confined to their own segments.
* [[Dr. Otto Scratchansniff]] - the [[Austria]]n-accented studio [[psychiatrist]], voiced by Rob Paulsen, who attempts to force the Warners to be less &quot;zany&quot;
* [[Thaddeus Plotz]] - the height-impaired [[CEO]] of the Warner Bros. Studios cartoon enterprise, voiced by [[Frank Welker]]
* [[Hello Nurse]] - the buxom studio nurse, voiced by Tress MacNeille, over whom Yakko and Wakko continually fawn
* [[Ralph (Animaniacs)|Ralph]] - a dim-witted Warners Studio [[security guard]] charged with recapturing the Warners and confining them to the [[water tower]]. His voice and vocal mannerisms are reminiscent of early Warner Brothers cartoon secondary characters intended to parody the character of Lennie from the film adaptations of ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 movie)|Of Mice and Men]]''.
* [[Pinky and the Brain]] - an imbecilic white mouse and his genius companion, voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]] and [[Maurice LaMarche]]. The Brain and his environment evoke [[Orson Welles]] and ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.
* [[Slappy Squirrel]] - an aging cartoon star voiced by [[Sherri Stoner]]
* [[Skippy Squirrel]] - Slappy's young nephew, voiced by [[Nathan Ruegger]], whose chipper personality is the polar opposite of his aunt's.
* [[Goodfeathers]] - a trio of cartoon pigeons— Bobby, Squit and Pesto, voiced by Maurice LaMarche, [[John Mariano]] and [[Chick Vennera]] — spoofing characters from the movie ''[[Goodfellas]]''
* [[Rita and Runt]] - a singing cat (voiced by [[Bernadette Peters]]) and a loyal but stupid dog (voiced by Frank Welker)
* [[Buttons and Mindy]] - a heroic [[Lassie]]-like dog (voiced by Frank Welker) and the accident-prone baby (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright (actress)|Nancy Cartwright]]) he is sworn to protect
* [[Minerva Mink]] - an incredibly sexy [[mink]], voiced by [[Julie Brown]], who inspires lustful fits in every male creature around her
* [[Katie Ka-Boom]] - a girl, voiced by [[Laura Mooney]], who has comically violent overreactions to trivially &quot;embarrassing&quot; situations in a parody of stereotypical teenage behavior, obviously modeled on the [[Incredible Hulk]]
* [[Flavio and Marita]] - also known as &quot;the Hip Hippos&quot;, a wealthy hippo couple (voiced by Frank Welker and Tress MacNeille) obsessed with being trendy
* [[Chicken Boo]] - a six-foot-tall chicken who is curiously successful at imitating humans despite minimal efforts at disguise
* [[Mr. Director]] - a caricature of [[Jerry Lewis]] (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]) who first appears in ''Hello Nice Warners''; in later episodes he parodies [[Marlon Brando]] in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' and appears as a clown who scares Mr. Plotz and Wakko
* [[The Flame]] - a childlike candle flame (voiced by [[Cody Ruegger]]) who is present at important historical events such as [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson's]] authoring of [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|The Declaration of Independence]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s writing of ''The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere''
* [[Charlton Chipmunk]] - an aspiring actor/director and generally neurotic [[chipmunk]]; when people annoy him, he asks them to write their names down in a book and promises that when he becomes famous, he will remember to not like them
* [[Mr. Skullhead]] - a mute skeleton seen in short ''Good Idea/Bad Idea'' clips and a parody of [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]''. These clips were narrated by humorist and [[Motel 6]] spokesman, [[Tom Bodett]]. 
* The Mime - a nameless [[Mime_artist|mime]] who mainly appeared in brief clips; the mime would usually begin a demonstration of some miming technique (e.g. &quot;walking against the wind&quot; or &quot;trapped in a box&quot;) only to be inexplicably maimed
* Colin, also known as the Randy Beaman Kid - a wide-eyed boy who relates improbable stories that allegedly happened to his (never-seen) friend Randy Beaman
* [[Ms. Flamiel]]- the Warners' prim and easily frustated teacher. 
* [[Pip (Animaniacs)|Pip]] - generally a foil and annoyance to the Warners, endlessly shaking hands and rambling nonsensically with an iron grip.  The Warners could never seem to get their hand detached from the grip of Pip, despite the great length of sight gags they employed to remove themselves. Voiced by [[Ben Stein]].

Celebrities in &quot;Animaniacs&quot;:

* [[Steven Spielberg]] - Spielberg plays as himself - always referred to in hushed tones as simply &quot;Steven&quot; - making short cameo appearances in very few episodes with one (or two) lines.
* [[Kirk Douglas]] - Not mentioned by name - Caricatured in the role of [[Michaelangelo]] painting the [[Sistine Chapel]] ceiling, reminiscent of [[Charlton Heston]] in [[The Agony and the Ecstasy]]. Meets [[Steven Spielberg]] who is referred to as &quot;His Eminence&quot;.

== Popularity of Animaniacs==
The comedy of ''Animaniacs'' was a broad mix of old-fashioned wit, [[slapstick]], [[pop culture]] references, and cartoon wackiness.  The show also featured a number of [[education]]al segments that covered subjects from [[history]] to [[math]] to [[geography]].  These educational segments, while simplistic in nature, were at a considerably more advanced level than in such children's shows as ''[[Sesame Street]]''; in fact, most adults could probably learn something from the show's explanations of world geography, the voyage of [[Ferdinand Magellan]], or the [[Panama Canal]].

While episodes of the show did have their share of flops (the Hip Hippos especially, followed mostly by Chicken Boo and Katie Ka-Boom), a surprisingly high number of well-written, outrageously funny cartoons were aired during the series, as the new madcap Warner Bros. animators merrily poked fun at everything and everyone, including their own fans (&quot;The Please Please Pleese Get A Life Foundation&quot;, which directly took from the ''alt.tv.animaniacs'' [[FAQ]] for its material). &lt;!-- That &quot;pleese&quot; is correct here, it was spelled that way on screen. --&gt;

While the show was very popular among younger viewers (the target demographic for Warner Bros.' TV cartoons), a great deal of the show's sly, subversive humor was definitely aimed at an adult audience.  In fact, one character, Minerva Mink, was soon deemphasized as a feature character on account that her featured episodes were considered too sexually suggestive for the show's intended timeslot.  Adults responded in droves, giving the show cult-hit status and leading to one of the first [[Internet]]-based [[fandom]] cultures.  During the show's prime, the Internet newsgroup ''[news:alt.tv.animaniacs alt.tv.animaniacs]'' was an active, popular gathering place for fans of the show (most of whom were definitely adults) to discuss the latest antics of the Warner Brothers and the Warner Sister.  The online popularity of the show did not go unnoticed by the show's producers, and several of the most active participants on the newsgroup were invited to the [[Warner Bros. Animation]] studios for informal get-togethers.

== Series history ==
===Reputation and legacy===
[[Image:TTA meets YWD.jpg|right|thumb|[[Yakko, Wakko and Dot]] shake hands with their predecessors: [[Babs and Buster Bunny|Buster and Babs Bunny]] and [[Plucky Duck]] (from ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'') in an episode of ''Animaniacs'']]
''Animaniacs'' premiered on [[September 13]], [[1993]].  New episodes of the show were aired during the [[1993]] through [[1998]] seasons, and episodes of the show were rerun in [[TV syndication|syndication]] for several years after production of new episodes ceased. One feature-length [[direct-to-video]] ''Animaniacs'' movie, ''[[Wakko's Wish]]'', was released on VHS only (there was no [[DVD]] release) in [[1999]].  The series was popular enough for Warner Bros. Animation to invest in additional episodes of the show past the traditional 65-episode marker for syndication; a total of 99 episodes were finally produced.  One theatrical cartoon short film starring the Warner siblings, &quot;I'm Mad,&quot; was produced and released to theaters in [[1994]] with the feature ''[[Thumbelina (film)|Thumbelina]]''.

The show introduced the popular cartoon characters [[Pinky and the Brain]], who were subsequently [[spin off|spun-off]] into their own TV series in [[1995]].

Animation fans consider ''Animaniacs'' the high point of the Warner Bros. revival of the [[1990s]] that was inspired by the original [[Termite Terrace]]. After ''Animaniacs,'' Spielberg collaborated with Warner Bros. Animation for a third time to produce the short-lived series ''[[Freakazoid]]'', along with the Animaniacs spin-off series ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]''.  Warner Bros. also produced two additional &quot;zany&quot; and &quot;madcap&quot; series in the later half of the decade entitled ''[[Histeria!]]'' (much like Animaniacs, but focusing on American history) and ''[[Detention]]'' (an animated sitcom of several quirky junior high kids trying to get out of after-school holding), but neither of these series found a sizable audience, and they were both swiftly cancelled.  Warner Bros. cut back the size of its animation studio (the high cost and relatively low profit of its animated feature films of the period also had an effect on the studio), and production on further Warner Bros. animated comedy series ceased.  ''Animaniacs'' and ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' continued to rerun in syndication through the [[1990s]] into the early [[2000s]]. In [[2005]], it was removed from the [[NickToons TV|NickToons]] network, and is not currently airing on [[TV]] in the [[U.S.]] &amp;ndash; In the [[United Kingdom]], however, it currently airs on [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]].

An ''Animaniacs'' comic book, published by [[DC Comics]], ran from [[1995]] to [[2000]] (59 regular monthly issues, plus two specials). [[Animaniacs (video game)|Animaniacs]], the [[Computer and video games|video game]] based on the series was also made for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Sega Genesis]].  There are new ''Animaniacs'' [[video games]] planned for release in the future on the [[Nintendo GameCube]] (''[[Animaniacs: The Great Edgar Hunt]]'') and [[Nintendo DS]] (''[[Animaniacs: Lights, Camera, Action!]]'').

An Animaniacs book called ''Dezanitized'' was produced. Apparently to take place when the Warners first escape, Dr. Scratchansniff attempts to subject the Warners to psychicatry, and thus root out the cause of the their zaniness and, as the book's title says, successfully ''dezanitize'' them. Although he meets them both as a trio and as indiviuals, Scratchansniff is unsuccessful, and in the book's final segment, is is he who is being psycho-analyzed by the Warners themselves. The book appears in a black-and-white comic strip or graphic novel format, and the [[fourth wall]] is often broken: Scratchansniff comments, when people yell at him, that &quot;the big letters&quot; hurt his ears. Wakko also splatters ink over the page, and the doctor complains that the book is messy, and now no one will want to buy it.

The series will re-run on Warner Bros. and [[AOL]]'s new broadband internet channel [[Toontopia TV]].

== The Animaniacs on DVD ==
Warner Bros. has announced ''Animaniacs'' may be released on DVD in the summer of 2006: [http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=4475]

==Music==
''Animaniacs'' was a very musical cartoon, with every episode featuring an original score (and in many cases, several original songs). Each group of characters had its own sub-theme in the score, and the Hip Hippos and Pinky and the Brain even had their own full [[theme song]]s.

The three Warner siblings often performed songs, including parodies of classical and folk music, often with an educational twist, listing, for example, U.S. states or American presidents. Pinky and the Brain occasionally got songs to sing as well, and the most complicated songs in the series usually went to Rita, voiced by singer [[Bernadette Peters]] (poking fun at Broadway shows in general, and [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s works in particular). Rita and Runt even took on Broadway directly with a parody of ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' called ''Les Miseranimals'', which aired early in the first season.

Three albums of music from the series were released: ''Animaniacs'', ‘‘Yakko’s World'', and ''Variety Pack'', and the sing-along videos, especially &quot;Yakko's World&quot;, remained some of the best selling skit compilation VHS tapes.

The final bars of the Animaniacs theme (as well as [[Bugs Bunny]] and the WB shield) are commonly used by [[Warner Bros.]] to begin various animated series.

The song ''[[Yakko's World]]'' is perhaps their most famous.

==Games==

*[[Animaniacs: The Great Edgar Hunt]] for [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], and [[Xbox]]

==Parodies==
''Animaniacs'' often parodied popular TV shows and movies. Some of the most frequent &quot;targets&quot; were children's television shows and action-adventure series. For example, ''Super Strong Warner Siblings'' lampooned the 90's TV series ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'', featuring replicas of the &quot;real&quot; show's costumes and &quot;megazord&quot;. Another parody, albeit a [[cold open]]ing rather than a full &quot;segment&quot;, depicted the ''Animaniacs'' characters as babies in a parody of the title sequence to ''[[Rugrats]]''. Popular kids' character [[Barney &amp; Friends|Barney]] was also represented as &quot;Baloney&quot;, a goofy character whose upbeat personality remained unaffected by the massive amounts of abuse to which the Warners subjected him.
Another example was the parody of ''[[Friends]]'' called &quot;Acquaintances&quot; where the character [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]] had his sarcastic putdowns horrifically enacted upon him.
''Animaniacs'' mocked an abundance of celebrities, including the likes of [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Howard Stern]], [[Jaleel White]], and [[Regis Philbin]]. They have also paid tributes to now-dead celebrities, such as [[Christa McAuliffe]], who was ''supposed'' to be the first [[Teacher in Space Project|teacher in space]], but tragically, she perished in the [[1986]] [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]]. They even made spoofs of various other disasters, such as the sinking of the ''[[Titanic]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Red Wine Glas.jpg|thumb|right|A glass of red wine contains about one unit of alcohol]]
In some countries a system of '''units of alcohol''' is employed for an approximate measure of the amount of [[ethanol|alcohol]] in different drinks.

== Formula ==
A unit of alcohol is equivalent to 10 [[litre|millilitre]]s (or approximately 8 [[gram]]s) of pure [[ethanol]], the active chemical ingredient in alcoholic beverages.

The number of units of alcohol in a drink can be determined by multiplying the volume of the drink (in millilitres) by its percentage [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]], and dividing by 1000. 

Thus a [[pint]] (568ml) of beer at 4%&amp;nbsp;ABV contains

&lt;math&gt;\frac{568 \times 4}{1000} = 2.3\mbox{ units}&lt;/math&gt;

== Quantities ==
As a rough guide:

*A glass of [[wine]] or [[sherry]], a single measure of [[Alcoholic beverage|spirits]] and a half pint of [[beer]] each contain about ''one unit'', or 8&amp;nbsp;g (0.25&amp;nbsp;oz) of alcohol.

*A large glass of red or white wine or half a pint of [[cider]] contains about 12g (3/8oz), or one and a half units. However strong [[lager]] may contain as much as two units per half pint.

== Limits ==
Since 1995 the UK government has advised that regular consumption of between three and four units a day for men and between two and three units a day for women would not pose significant health risks, but that consistently drinking four or more units a day (men) or three or more units a day (women) is not advisable. The difference between genders is given due to the (typically) lower weight and water-to-body-mass-ratio of women.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Aotus''''' is both a plant and an animal:
*It is one of the genera for the [[Aotus (pea)|golden pea]]s in [[Fabaceae]] (bean family).
*It is the genus for the [[night monkey]]s in Aotidae.
The name means &quot;earless&quot; in both cases: the monkey is missing external [[ear]]s, and the pea is missing earlike bracteoles.

[[Image:Timeallymcbeal.jpg|thumb|''[[Time]]'' magazine, [[June 29]], [[1998]]. This cover depicts pioneering women [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Betty Friedan]], and [[Gloria Steinem]] juxtaposed with McBeal and asks &quot;Is Feminism Dead?&quot;  It is an example of the debate which revolved around the show and how it depicted women's roles in American society in the 1990s.]]
'''''Ally McBeal''''' was an [[United States|American]] [[television]] [[dramedy]] created by [[David E. Kelley]], with [[Calista Flockhart]] in the title role as a young [[lawyer]] working in a [[fiction]]al [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] law firm named Cage &amp; Fish, filled with similarly young lawyers whose lives and loves are highly [[melodrama]]tic. The show ran on the [[Fox Television Network|FOX]] network from [[1997]] to [[2002]].

Despite its legal environment, the show pays minimal attention to the actual practice of law.  Instead it focuses on the romantic and personal lives of the main characters, though sometimes juxtaposing legal proceedings as plot devices to contrast or reinforce a character's drama.  For example, bitter divorce litigation of a client might backdrop Ally's decision to break up with a boyfriend.

Particularly notable, the show frequently used vivid, dramatic fantasy visuals for a character's wishful thinking.  Also, regular visits to a local, idealized [[bar (establishment)|bar]] where singer and cast member [[Vonda Shepard]] regularly performed (though occasionally handing over the microphone to the characters).  Each episode generally concluded on an upbeat, hopeful note with energetic music.

''Ally McBeal'' was hugely successful, but received much criticism from TV critics and [[feminist]]s who found the title character annoying and demeaning to women because of her excessive flightiness, lack of demonstrated legal knowledge, and extreme emotional instability. Flockhart's visible loss of weight by the second season also caused much media speculation.

However, Ally's search for true love struck a chord with young female audiences, and the [[eccentricity (behaviour)|eccentric]] characters around her were developed further, giving the show firm footing.

In the fourth season, [[Robert Downey Jr.]] joined the regular cast as Ally's boyfriend Larry, resurrecting the [[ratings]] of a show that had lost its novelty and thus much of its audience. However, when Downey was forced to leave as his (real life) [[drug addiction]] caused him legal troubles, plus other central cast members such as [[Lucy Liu]] also left, the ratings sank again. Not even guest appearances from [[Matthew Perry (actor)|Matthew Perry]] and singer [[Jon Bon Jovi]] and [[Christina Ricci]] in season five were enough to save the show.

The major cast members of the show included:

*[[Calista Flockhart]]- Ally McBeal
*[[Greg Germann]] - Richard Fish
*[[Jane Krakowski]] - Elaine Vassal
*[[Gil Bellows]] - Billy Thomas (1997-2000)
*[[Lisa Nicole Carson]] - Renée Radick (1997-2001)
*[[Courtney Thorne-Smith]] - Georgia Thomas (1997-2000)
*[[Peter MacNicol]] - John Cage
*[[Vonda Shepard]] - Herself
*[[Lucy Liu]] - Ling Woo (1998-2001)
*[[Portia de Rossi]] - Nelle Porter (1998-2002)
*[[Robert Downey Jr.]] - Larry Paul (2000-2001)
*[[James LeGros]] - Mark Albert (2000-2001)
*[[Regina Hall]] - Corretta Lipp (2001-2002)
*[[Josh Hopkins]] - Raymond Milbury (2001-2002)
*[[James Marsden]] - Glenn Foy (2001-2002)
*[[Julianne Nicholson]] - Jenny Shaw (2001-2002)
*[[Barry Humphries]] (as [[Dame Edna Everage]], uncredited) - (2002)

Notable guest stars on the show included comedian [[Tracey Ullman]] as Ally's unusual [[therapy|therapist]], and singers [[Barry White]], [[Al Green (musician)|Al Green]], [[Gordon Sumner|Sting]], [[Tina Turner]], and [[Barry Manilow]] as themselves. Special musical guests included [[KC and the Sunshine Band]], [[Elton John]] and [[Josh Groban]].

Barry White's music was frequently showcased on the show as a sexual stimulant; when one of the characters mentally &quot;heard&quot; the music, other characters would be attracted. This action was often accompanied by dancing and took place in the unisex bathroom.

At the height of its popularity, re-edited half-hour versions of the show ran under the name ''Ally''.

The show is also noted by many for introducing the '[[dancing baby]]' [[computer-generated image]] (CGI) to mainstream American pop culture.

Known for controversial topics, the show was well-known for the infamous Cro-Magnon episode, whereby a well-endowed male model becomes the focus of the Ally's attentions. Some critics have claimed that this [[penis size]] obsessed view of female sexuality is distorted and reflects more of a male point of view, as the show was written by [[David E. Kelley]]. Others have charged that the ridiculing of modestly endowed men is sexist and harmful, contributing to body issues for men similar to that of young women over their weight. On that note as well, the show has been criticized for the &quot;[[Anorexia nervosa|anorexic]]&quot; main character as being a bad role model for girls. 

Due to [[music rights]] issues, Ally McBeal has not been made available on DVD in the United States, though it has been available in [[Italy]], [[Japan]] and [[UK]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''André le Chapelain''', in Latin '''Andreas Capellanus''' (''Capellanus'' meaning &quot;chaplain&quot;), was the 12th century author of a treatise entitled ''[[De amore]]'' (''On Love''). The complete title of his three-volume work published ''c.'' 1185 reads ''Liber de arte honeste amandi et reprobatione inhonesti amantis'' (''Book of the Art of Loving Nobly and the Reprobation of Dishonourable Love'', also known as ''The Book of Courtly Love'').

Capellanus is also an important author for our understanding of mediæval education&amp;mdash;a source of much information about the [[trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] of the period.

After becoming popularized by the troubadours of southern France in the 12th Century, the social system of &quot;courtly love&quot; soon spread.  Evidence of the influence of courtly love in the culture and literature of most of Western Europe spans centuries.

The unabridged edition of The Art of Courtly Love codified life at Queens Eleanor's court at Poitiers between 1170 and 1174 (although Capellanus wrote it most likely several years later) into &quot;one of those capital works which reflect the thought of a great epoch, which explains the secret of a civilization.&quot;  This translation of a work that may be viewed as didactic, mocking, or merely descriptive, preserves the attitudes and practices that were the foundation of a long and significant tradition in English literature.

Andreas Capellanus (Andre the Chaplain) wrote this work at the request of Countess Marie of Troyes, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine. (As found on the reverse of The Art of Courtly Love, trans. John Jay Parry, 1960)

The work gives a listing of the stages of love which resembles in some ways the modern [[baseball euphemism]]:

:&quot;Throughout all the ages, there have been only four degrees &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''gradus''] in love:
:&quot;The first consists in arousing hope;
:&quot;The second in offering kisses;
:&quot;The third in the enjoyment of intimate embraces;
:&quot;The fourth in the abandonment of the entire person.&quot;

The '''American Civil Liberties Union''', or '''ACLU''', is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) whose stated goal is to &quot;defend and preserve the [[individual rights]] and [[liberty|liberties]] guaranteed to every person ... by the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] and [[Law of the United States|laws]] of the [[United States]].&quot; [[Lawsuit]]s brought by the ACLU have been influential in several important developments in [[U.S. constitution]]al law, and according to the annual report has over 500,000 members as of the end of 2005. The ACLU provides [[lawyer]]s and legal expertise in cases where it believes an individual's or group of individuals' rights are being challenged by the government or other citizens.  In many cases where it does not provide legal representation, the ACLU submits ''[[amicus curiae]]'' [[brief (law)|brief]]s in support of its positions. The ACLU has never officially supported or opposed a political candidate, and is not aligned with any political party, though it has been harshly critical of various elected officials of both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] over the years. Outside of its legal work, the organization has also engaged in [[lobbying]] of elected officials and civil liberties [[activism]] [http://action.aclu.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AP_action_homepage]. The ACLU is one of the most influential NGOs in the United States today; often controversial, its stances have engendered criticism from both sides of the political spectrum (see [[American Civil Liberties Union#Critics of the ACLU|Critics of the ACLU]]).

==History, structure and leadership==
The ACLU was originally established in 1917 as the [[National Civil Liberties Bureau]] (NCLB), an outgrowth of the [[American Union Against Militarism]], an organization that was against American intervention in [[World War I]]. The NCLB provided legal advice and aid for [[conscientious objector|conscientious objectors]] and those being prosecuted under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] or [[Sedition Act of 1918]]. The organization was subpoenaed by the New York legislature's Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate Seditious Activities, popularly known as the [[Lusk Committee]], which considered the organization's efforts and pacifist ties to be a vehicle for socialist and communist propaganda.  The NCLB changed its name in 1920 to the American Civil Liberties Union.[http://www.aclu.org/about/index.html]

Founders include [[Crystal Eastman]], [[Albert DeSilver]] and [[Roger Nash Baldwin]] among others.

In the year of its birth, the ACLU was formed to protect aliens threatened with [[deportation]], and U.S. nationals threatened with criminal charges by [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer]] for their [[communist]] or [[socialist]] activities and agendas (see [[Palmer Raids]]). It also opposed attacks on the rights of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and other [[labor union]]s to meet and organize.

In 1940, the ACLU formally barred communists from leadership or staff positions, and would take the position that it did not want communists as members either. The board declared that it was &quot;inappropriate for any person to serve on the governing committees of the Union or its staff, who is a member of any political organization which supports [[totalitarian dictatorship]] in any country, or who by his public declarations indicates his support of such a principle.&quot; [http://www.aclu-mass.org/about/about_history.html] [http://infoshare1.princeton.edu/libraries/firestone/rbsc/finding_aids/aclu1920/] The purge, which was led by Baldwin, himself a former supporter of Communism, began with the ouster of [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], a member of both the [[Communist Party of the USA]] and the [[IWW]] [http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/baldwin.html]. The ACLU has been criticized by some of its later members for this policy, and in the 1960s there was an internal push to remove this prohibition. [http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2005_09_04-2005_09_10.shtml#1126047007]

In the 1988 presidential election, then-[[Vice President]] [[George H.W. Bush]] called then-[[Governor]] [[Michael Dukakis]] a &quot;card-carrying member of the ACLU,&quot; which Dukakis proudly acknowledged. [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/dod/1988-broadcast.html] It now serves as a jocular recruitment slogan for the ACLU. [http://www.aclu.org/Contribute/Contribute.cfm]

The [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], and the ensuing debate regarding the proper balance of civil liberties and security including the passage of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], led to a 20% increase in membership between August 2001 and December 2002, when its total enrollment reached 330,000 [http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20021202aclusidebarp8.asp]. The growth has continued; in August 2004, ACLU membership was at 400,000 [http://www.madison.com/tct/news/images/index.php?ntid=7175&amp;ntpid=0].

The ACLU has been a vocal opponent of the PATRIOT Act of 2001, the proposed (as of 2003) [[Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003|PATRIOT 2]] Act, and associated legislation made in response to the threat of domestic terrorism, that it believes violates either the letter or the spirit of the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]]. In response to a requirement of the PATRIOT Act, the ACLU withdrew from a Federal Donation Program that provides matching funds from the federal government for federal employees. The requirement was that ACLU employees must be checked against a federal anti-terrorism watch list. The ACLU estimates that it will lose approximately $500,000 in such contributions.

&lt;!--Need more here on PATRIOT Act challenges, and ACLU activities post-9/11 in general, including stats on increase in membership.--&gt;

Currently, the leadership of the ACLU includes Executive Director [[Anthony Romero]], President [[Nadine Strossen]], and Legal Director [[Steven Shapiro]].  Notably, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], a current Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], founded the ACLU's Women's Rights Project in 1972.

[[Image:Antonio Villaraigosa.jpg|left|thumb|260px|[[Los Angeles]] Mayor [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] speaking at an [[ACLU]] event.  Villaraigosa is the former director of the ACLU Southern California affiliate.]]

Although the ACLU has its national headquarters located in New York City, the organization does most of its work through locally based affiliates, organized into fifty state chapters.  These affiliates maintain a certain amount of autonomy from the National organization, and are able to work independently from each other.  Many of the ACLU's cases originate from the local level and are handled by lawyers from the local affiliates.

The ACLU's involvement in the internment of Japanese in the United States during World War II, which bears on the question of local autonomy, is misunderstood, and often misrepresented.  There are differing ideas on the role the ACLU took, some have argued that the ACLU remained silent on the issue. Still others have claimed that the national branch of the ACLU threatened to revoke the chapter status of the ACLU of Northern California for defending Toyosaburo Korematsu in the Supreme Court in [[Korematsu v. United States]], {{ussc|323|214|1944}}.  These arguments are hard to square with the fact that the national branch of the ACLU actually filed a brief of amicus curiae with the court on behalf of Mr. Korematsu.

In fact, the ACLU argued that some internments may have been necessary for the security of the nation, but that by interning Americans without giving them a hearing, the military was violating their right to due process.  The ACLU argued that the internments should have civilian oversight, instead of military,  and that the Japanese in the camps had been interned on the basis of racial discrimination.

State chapters remain the basic unit of the ACLU's organization. In a twenty month period beginning January 2004, the ACLU's [[New Jersey]] chapter, to take one example, was involved in fifty-one cases according to their annual report -- thirty-five cases in state courts, and sixteen in federal court. They provided legal representation in thirty-three of those cases, and served as amicus in the remaining eighteen. They listed forty-four volunteer attorneys who assisted them in those cases.

==Positions==
The ACLU's stated mission is to defend the rights of all citizens as enshrined in the [[Bill of Rights]] of the United States Constitution.  While the bulk of the ACLU's cases involve the [[First Amendment]], Equal Protection and Due Process and cases involving the right to privacy (see, ''e.g.'', the [[Louisiana]] chapter [http://www.laaclu.org/Complaints/complaints.html]), the organization has taken positions on a wide range of controversial issues. In particular, the ACLU:

* Supports the [[separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]]; under this mandate, the ACLU:
** Opposes the government-sponsored display of religious symbols on [[public property]];
** Opposes official prayers, religious ceremonies, or [[moment of silence|moments of silence]] in public schools or schools funded with public [[money]];
* Supports full [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment]] rights of citizens, organizations and the press, including school [[newspaper]]s;
* Supports [[reproductive rights]], including the right to use [[contraception]] and to have an [[abortion]];
* Supports full civil rights for [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], including government benefits for homosexual couples equal to those provided for heterosexual ones;
* Supports [[affirmative action]] as a means of redressing past discrimination and achieving a racially diverse student body [http://www.aclu.org/RacialEquality/RacialEqualityMain.cfm];
* Supports the rights of [[defendant]]s and suspects against [[unconstitutional]] [[police]] practices;
* Supports the [[decriminalization]] of [[recreational drug use|drugs]] such as [[heroin]], [[cocaine]] and [[marijuana]] [http://www.aclu.org/DrugPolicy/DrugPolicy.cfm?ID=12401&amp;c=19];
* Opposes demonstration permits and other requirements for protests in public places;
* Is critical of current surveillance camera practices, citing privacy violations [http://www.aclunc.org/police/oak-video.html].

The ACLU has opposed some campaign finance laws such as the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]], which it considers an inappropriate restriction upon freedom of expression. It does not, however, have a blanket opposition to all laws on campaign finance.

The official policy of the national ACLU argues that the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|second amendment]] is &quot;intended mainly to protect the right of the states to maintain militias to assure their own freedom and security against the central government&quot; and is not intended to &quot;confer an unlimited right upon individuals to own guns or other weapons.&quot; [http://www.aclu.org/PolicePractices/PolicePractices.cfm?ID=9621&amp;c=25] The ACLU has generally avoided taking gun-related cases, and this has occasioned criticism by those who consider their interpretation of the amendment to be far &quot;softer&quot; than its &quot;hard-line&quot; stances on other parts of the law.

The ACLU has been noted for vigorously defending the right to express unpopular, controversial, and extremist opinions on both the left and right. Some have expressed the view that the ACLU sometimes plays a role comparable to that played by [[public defender]]s, helping to ensure that even unpopular defendants receive due process.

==Notable cases==
 
Since its founding, the ACLU has been involved in many cases (see the [[List of ACLU Cases]] for a fuller list). A few of the most significant are discussed here.

In 1925, the ACLU persuaded [[John T. Scopes]] to defy [[Tennessee]]'s anti-[[evolution]] law in a court test. [[Clarence Darrow]], a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The ACLU lost the case and Scopes was fined $100. The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the law but overturned the conviction on a technicality.

In 1942, a few months after the [[Japan]]ese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], the ACLU affiliates on the West Coast became some of the sharpest critics of the government's policy on enemy aliens and U.S. citizens descended from enemy ancestry. This included the relocation of [[Japanese American Internment|Japanese-American citizens]], [[internment]] of aliens, prejudicial curfews (''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'', 1943), and the like. However, the national board of the ACLU dodged the issue, taking a mildly pro-government position: it accepted the internment in principle and only demanded that relocatees, once &quot;cleared&quot; of any suspicion of wrongdoing, be released from the concentration camps in which they were held.

&lt;!--missing blurb on its 1947 case which brought the idea of the separation of church and state into american legal practice--&gt;
In 1954, the ACLU played a role in the case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', which led to the ban on segregation in U.S. [[public school]]s.

In 1973, the organization was the first major national organization to call for the [[impeachment]] of President [[Richard M. Nixon]], giving as reasons the violation by the Nixon administration of civil liberties. That same year, the ACLU was involved in the cases of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', in which the Supreme Court held that the constitutional right of privacy extended to women seeking [[abortion]]s.

In 1977, the ACLU filed suit against the Village of [[Skokie, Illinois]], seeking an injunction against the enforcement of three town ordinances outlawing [[Nazi]] parades and demonstrations (Skokie had a large [[Jew]]ish population). A federal district court struck down the ordinances in a decision eventually affirmed by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. The ACLU's action in this case led to the resignation of about 15 percent of the membership from the organization (25 percent in [[Illinois]]), especially of [[Judaism|Jewish]] members. A cutback in its activities was avoided by a special mailing which elicited $500,000 in contributions. 

In his February 23, 1978 decision overturning the town ordinances, US District Court Judge Bernard M. Decker described the principle involved in the case as follows: &quot;It is better to allow those who preach racial hatred to expend their venom in rhetoric rather than to be panicked into embarking on the dangerous course of permitting the government to decide what its citizens may say and hear ... The ability of American society to tolerate the advocacy of even hateful doctrines ... is perhaps the best protection we have against the establishment of any Nazi-type regime in this country.&quot;

In the 1980s, the ACLU filed suit to challenge the [[Arkansas]] 1981 [[creationism]] statute, which required the teaching in public schools of the biblical account of creation as a scientific alternative to evolution. The law was declared unconstitutional by a Federal District Court.

==Funding==
The ACLU receives funding from a large number of sources; the distribution and amount of funding for each chapter varies from state to state. To take one particular example, the ACLU of [[New Jersey]] reported $1.2 million in income to both the ACLU-NJ and its affiliated tax-exempt foundation in the the 2005 fiscal year. Of that income, 46% came from contributions, 19% came from membership dues, 18% came from court awarded attorney fees, 12% came from grants, 4% came from investment income and the remainder from other sources. Its expenses in the same period were $800,000, of which 12% went to administration and management. Smaller chapters with fewer resources, such as that in [[Nebraska]], receive subsidies from the national ACLU [http://www.aclunebraska.org/faq.htm#10]. 

The ACLU and its affiliated tax-exempt foundation receive annual support from the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]], [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]], [[Carnegie Foundation|Carnegie]], [[Field Foundation|Field]], [[Tides Foundation|Tides]], [[Gill Foundation|Gill]], [[Arcus Foundation|Arcus]], [[Horizons Fund|Horizons]], and other foundations.  However, recently the ACLU rejected $1.5 million from both the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations because it viewed a clause in the donation agreement stipulating that &quot;none of the money would go to underwriting terrorism or other unacceptable activities&quot; as a threat to civil liberties.  The ACLU also withdrew from a federal charity drive, losing an estimated $500,000, taking a stand against the attached condition that it would &quot;not knowingly hire anyone on terrorism watch lists.&quot; Other key donors include Peter B. Lewis (an insurance magnate) [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/08/national/08aclu.html].

It is sometimes asserted that the ACLU collects legal fees in the event that they are involved on the winning side of a legal judgment [http://stoptheaclu.com/archives/2005/08/05/christian-group-asks-congress-to-investigate-aclu-for-frivolous-dangerous-lawsuits/]. As described in greater detail below, while there are restrictions on how fees may be collected, the ACLU has in a number of cases indeed received substantial monetary awards.

The awarding of legal fees to groups like the ACLU in civil rights cases remains highly controversial for some. The Public Expression of Religion Act of 2005, for example, introduced by Representative [[John N. Hostettler]], seeks to alter prior civil rights legislation to prevent monetary judgements in the particular case of violations of church-state separation [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.2679:], and groups such as the [[American Legion]] have taken stances opposing the ACLU's right to collect fees under such legislation [http://www.legion.org/word/aclu.rtf]. On the other hand, the recovery of legal fees by non-profit legal advocacy organizations is common practice across the political spectrum; the [[pro-life]] [[Thomas More Law Center]], for example, generally seeks, and is successful in, recovery of legal fees in the same manner as the ACLU [http://www.thomasmore.org/news.html?NewsID=227], [http://www.thomasmore.org/news.html?NewsID=383].

In many cases however, due to the nature of its legal work, the ACLU is involved in litigation against governmental bodies, which are generally protected from adverse monetary judgements: ''i.e.'', a town, state or Federal agency may be required to change its laws or behave differently, but not to pay monetary damages except by an explicit statutory waiver [http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/959/]; [http://www.chainyounger.com/pa_cases_against_government.html#1].

In some cases, the law does permit plantiffs who successfully sue government agencies to collect damages. In particular, a 1976 Federal law, the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act, among other similar laws, does leave the government liable in some civil rights cases. In many cases where the ACLU represents plantiffs, the case is handled not by ACLU attorneys, but by sympathetic law firms who provide their services ''[[pro bono]]''. In these cases, the law firm may sue for legal fees; in such circumstances the money would be awarded to the firm, and not the ACLU. [http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2005/08/volokh_on_stopt.php]

These caveats aside, the ACLU and its state chapters do, in cases where they provide legal services and laws permit government liability, share in monetary judgements against government agencies. It shared, for example, with other plantiffs in a $156,960 judgement against the State of [[Nebraska]] in a gay marriage case now on appeal [http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2005/08/02/local/doc42efae0b8e7f7297850171.txt]. 

A separate example involves a string of church-state cases. The Georgia chapter was awarded $150,000 in fees after suing a county courthouse for the removal of a [[Ten Commandments]] display [http://www.acluga.org/press.releases/0507/barrow.county.html]; a second Ten Commandments case in the State, in a different county, led to a $74,462 judgment [http://www.acluga.org/docket.html]. Meanwhile, the State of [[Tennessee]] was required to pay $50,000, the State of [[Alabama]] $175,000, and the State of [[Kentucky]] $121,500, in similar Ten Commandments cases [http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/07/09/loc_kytencommandments09.html], [http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_10cb.htm]. 

The State of [[Kentucky]] was in fact required by courts to pay the ACLU nearly $700,000 in legal fees in the years 1994-2003, mainly for passing abortion and state religion-related laws later struck down by courts [http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/07/09/loc_kytencommandments09.html]. Ref. [http://www.reclaimamerica.org/Pages/News/newspage.asp?story=2859] is a partial list of various judgments awarded to the ACLU and its state chapters over the years, which cover a wide variety of cases including judgments involving creationism, internet pornography, church-state and free speech cases, and total approximately $2.9 million. Usually, judgements are made against states, although [[Operation Rescue]] was required to pay the Union $111,000 in fees in a [[San Diego]] case.

When taking on highly contentious cases the ACLU leaves itself liable to potentially damaging judgements against it if it were found to be filing a &quot;frivolous&quot; suit, regardless of whether the government may be liable.

==Controversial stances==

The organization believes that free speech rights must be available to all citizens and residents of the United States.  Therefore, it has taken on unpopular cases to defend the free speech rights of clients such as [[Ku Klux Klan]] members, [[neo-Nazi]] groups, and [[North American Man-Boy Love Association|NAMBLA]], a group which supports legalization of [[pederasty]]. A number of controversial cases in which the ACLU has been involved are discussed in the sections below.

The ACLU has defended [[Frank Snepp]] formerly of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (from an attempt of this government agency to gag him) and Lieutenant Colonel [[Oliver North]] (convicted on the basis of coerced testimony&amp;mdash;a violation of his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fifth amendment rights]]).

The ACLU's stance on [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] is considered controversial by a broad cross-section of political points-of-view. The ACLU has opposed many anti-spam laws, and in 2000 Marvin Johnson, a legislative counsel for the ACLU, claimed that anti-spam laws are a bad idea because &quot;it's relatively simple to click and delete,&quot; [http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/06/09/amend.spam.idg/] advice which is rejected by many spam fighters. [http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/spam/chapter/ch01.html] The debate found the ACLU joining with the [[Direct Marketing Association]] and the [[Center for Technology and Democracy]] in criticizing a bipartisan bill in the [[House of Representatives]] in 2000; already by 1997 the ACLU had taken a strong position that nearly all spam legislation was improper [http://www.anu.edu.au/mail-archives/link/link9709/0306.html], although it has supported &quot;[[opt-out]]&quot; requirements in some cases. Most recently the ACLU opposed the 2003 [[CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003|CAN-SPAM]] act [http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/commercial/10953leg20030730.html] suggesting the possibility of a [[chilling effect]].

In many cases, whether or not a stance is considered controversial depends on other political views the critic may hold. These are discussed in greater detail in sections below.

==Critics of the ACLU==

The ACLU's involvement in hundreds of legal cases over the years have led to a great deal of criticism from numerous points of view. In many situations, the criticism may be focused on the ACLU's stance in a particular case or group of cases; in others, the criticism focuses on the general principles that guide the ACLU's choices of which cases to take. 

It may be taken for granted that many groups oppose some or all of the ACLU's &quot;positions&quot; listed above; here we discuss only the most general themes the criticism has taken.

===Conservative critics===

The ACLU's most vocal critics are generally those who consider themselves, or are commonly regarded as, [[conservative]]s.  Many of these conservatives allege that the ACLU has not dedicated itself to the defense of constitutional rights, but that it seeks to advance a [[liberal]] agenda.  Some critics point to its opposition to the [[death penalty]], which has been declared constitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] since 1976, although it had been declared unconstitutional in practice from 1972 to 1976. The ACLU continues to argue that the death penalty violates the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] restriction against &quot;cruel and unusual punishment,&quot; the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] guarantee of equal protection, and that it is contrary to [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|international human rights]] norms.

The 1980 ''[[Polovchak v. Meese]]'' case is also sometimes considered evidence of liberal sympathies on the part of the ACLU. [[Walter Polovchak]] was from [[Ukraine]], at that time part of the [[Soviet Union]], and when his parents were returning to Ukraine, tried to stay in the US and claim [[refugee|political asylum]]. The ACLU attempted to block him from doing so. In 1999 the Florida chapter of the ACLU referred to the ACLU's role in the Polovchak case in their brief for the [[Elián González]] case.

Critics also argue that the ACLU has not been consistent in defending all civil liberties, pointing out that it is not active in protecting [[Gun politics in the US|gun rights]]. Critics claim gun rights enjoy similar constitutional protection to other civil rights and should be treated equally by the ACLU if it is not motivated by a partisan agenda. The organization declares itself officially &quot;neutral&quot; on the issue of gun control, pointing to previous Supreme Court decisions such as ''[[United States v. Miller]]'' to argue that the [[Second Amendment]] applies to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia, and the unlimited possession of weapons by individuals is not constitutionally protected. [http://www.aclu.org/PolicePractices/PolicePractices.cfm?ID=9621&amp;c=25] 

Some critics argue that this position is inconsistent with their stated philosophy, and have suggested that the ACLU may only adopt this stance to appease liberal-leaning supporters of the group who happen to also support gun control. Critics also point out that the ACLU does not take up cases that involve possible abuses by the [[BATFE]] that go beyond the debate over the private ownership of firearms. [http://www.civilrightsunion.org/acluwatch/socalledgun.htm] The ACLU has been involved in a few gun rights cases; most recently the ACLU of Texas joined with the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] in favor of a proposed Texas law, HB 823, in 2006, and claiming that current legislation allowed for the harassment of gun owners [http://gritsforbreakfast.blogspot.com/2005/03/pack-your-pistola-and-hit-road.html].

In 1982, the ACLU became involved in a case involving the distribution of [[child pornography]] (''New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747'' [http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/279/].) In a controversial amicus brief, the ACLU argued that the [[New York State]] law in question &quot;has criminalized the dissemination, sale or display of constitutionally protected non-obscene materials which portray juveniles in sexually related roles&quot;, while arguing that child pornography deemed [[obscene]] under the [[Miller test]] deserved no constitutional protection and could be banned [http://campus.westlaw.com/Find/Default.wl?SerialNum=1982191934&amp;FindType=Y&amp;AP=0-2&amp;ReturnTo=CLID_RT4918149&amp;POP=False&amp;IT=BRIEF&amp;TF=15&amp;TC=1&amp;mt=CampusLegal&amp;fn=_top&amp;sv=Split&amp;vr=2.0&amp;sp=princeton-2000&amp;rs=WLW5.09]. The ACLU's stance on this case has drawn great criticism from conservatives [http://euphoria.jarkolicious.com/journal/2005/06/16/516/]. In a 2002 letter, the ACLU stated that it &quot;opposes child pornography that uses real children in its depictions&quot; [http://www.aclu.org/Privacy/Privacy.cfm?ID=10364&amp;c=252].

The group has also come under fire, again mostly from conservative critics, for fighting against [[Megan's Law|Megan’s Law]], a law ostensibly enacted to protect children from sex offenders. Though the ACLU has fought Megan’s Law(s) in many states, it has been unable to attain significant victories in these cases.

[[Bill O'Reilly (journalist)|Bill O'Reilly]] has referred to the ACLU as &quot;the most dangerous organization in America&quot;, and as an &quot;anti-American&quot; and &quot;[[fascist]] organization&quot; on his various broadcasts, and frequently [[Bill O'Reilly (journalist)#American Civil Liberties Union|criticizes the group]] [http://mediamatters.org/items/200406080005].

[[Michael Medved]] has referred to the ACLU sarcastically as the &quot;American Criminal Lawyer Union&quot;, due to its frequent stances at end with conservatives. The construction of alternative [[backronyms]] is something of a sport; others invented by critics include &quot;American Communist Lawyers Union&quot; [http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=41751]. The group &quot;Stop the ACLU&quot; ran a backronym contest [http://www.stoptheaclu.org/wst_page9.html]. The thirty entries variously implied that the ACLU was atheist, Communist, lesbian, aligned with [[Lucifer]], or overly [[litigation|litigious]]. The most frequent assertion, made in a plurality of eleven entries, was that the union was anti-Christian.

===Conservative Christian critics===

At the grassroots level, the ACLU often involves itself in cases involving the [[separation of church and state]].  Therefore, some [[Christians]], including many who may be considered [[conservative Christian]], often take issue with its positions. Many in this community contend that the ACLU is part of an effort to remove all references to religion from American government.

In 2004, for example, the ACLU of Southern California (ACLU/SC) threatened to sue the city of [[Redlands, California]] if it did not remove a picture of a cross from the city's seal.  The ACLU/SC argued that having a cross on the seal amounted to a government-sponsored endorsement of Christianity and violated separation of church and state.  The city complied with the ACLU/SC and removed the cross from all city vehicles, business cards, and police badges.  However, the issue will be put on the November 2005 ballot [http://www.redlandsseal.org]. The ACLU/SC also threatened  [[Los Angeles County, California]] if it did not remove an image of a cross from its seal.  As in the Redlands case, the county board complied with the demands and voted to remove the cross from its seal as well. There was a petition against the changing of the seal, which ended on [[August 15]], [[2005]] [http://www.savetheseal.net/].

In [[1990]], [[Pat Robertson]] founded the [[American Center for Law and Justice]], as a counterweight to the ACLU, which is perceived by Robertson as &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;hostile to traditional [[American values]]&quot;; another non-profit legal center, the [[Thomas More Law Center]], also bills itself as the &quot;Christian answer to the ACLU.&quot;

After the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attack]], the Rev. [[Jerry Falwell]] remarked that the ACLU, by trying to &quot;secularize America,&quot; had provoked the wrath of God, and therefore caused those terrorist attacks.  (Falwell later apologized for the remark.)  Other critics of the ACLU do not make such strong accusations, but claim that the organization pushes the concept of separation of church and state beyond its original meaning. The ACLU and Jerry Falwell sometimes find themselves on the same side.  Notably, the ACLU filed an amicus brief supporting a suit by Falwell against the state of Virginia.  The suit, which was successful, overturned the Virginia constitution's ban on the incorporation of Churches.  In addition, the ACLU has defended the rights of a Christian church to run anti-Santa ads on Boston subways, the rights to religious expression by jurors, and the rights of Christian students to distribute religious literature in school. [http://www.aclu.org/ReligiousLiberty/ReligiousLiberty.cfm?ID=17598&amp;c=38]

While the ACLU does oppose the use of crosses in public monuments [http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040331/news_7m31soledad.html], [http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=43799], there have been false allegations that the ACLU has urged the removal of cross-shaped [[headstone]]s from federal [[cemetery|cemeteries]] and has opposed prayer by [[soldier]]s; such charges have been deemed to be [[urban legend]]s. [http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/cemetery.asp]

Many minority religious groups like [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Muslim]]s have at times been defended by the ACLU and are ardent supporters of it. In the [[Mormon]] community, the ACLU is viewed positively by some, who cite [[Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe]], a case litigated by the ACLU on behalf of a Mormon student concerning [[school prayer]] [http://wenger.blogspot.com/2003_08_10_wenger_archive.html#106087652143939285]. However, a good number of Mormons, including some local leaders, are strongly against the activities of the ACLU [http://www.timesandseasons.org/archives/000198.html]. 

Jehovah's Witnesses were involved in twenty-three Supreme Court rulings between 1938 and 1946 over religious objections to serving in the armed forces and over saluting the flag and reciting the pledge of allegiance [http://www.commondreams.org/views/022800-105.htm], over local and state ordinances prohibiting the Witnesses from publishing criticisms of the [[Roman Catholic]] church [http://www.commondreams.org/views/022800-105.htm], as well as over government reluctance to prosecute anti-Witness vigilantes; the ACLU was directly involved in these cases [http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/petjud.html]; the ACLU's involvement with Jehovah's Witnesses continues, and they joined the Witnesses in a 2002 case over doorbell-ringing [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nation/1272268.html].

===Liberal critics===

The ACLU has also, though less frequently, been subject to criticism from the [[political left]]. Some critics object to the organization's advocacy for corporations' protection by the Bill of Rights known as [[corporate personhood]], as well as its stance against some campaign finance reform laws.

===Feminist &amp; Left critics===
Some [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography activists]], including [[Nikki Craft]] and [[Catharine MacKinnon]], who oppose pornography on [[feminist]] grounds, are also strong critics of the ACLU; in her lifetime, [[Andrea Dworkin]]'s positions on pornography also led her to similar stances. A group, started by Craft in the early 1990s, is called &quot;Always Causing Legal Unrest (ACLU)&quot;; the resultant acronym confusion led the then-director of the Union [[Dorothy M. Ehrlich]] to send a letter of protest [http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/aclu/Ehrlich.html], but the Union did not pursue legal action against Craft's group.

===Libertarian critics===

While some refer to the ACLU as a [[libertarian]] organization and while the ACLU has defended the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|US Libertarian Party]] in recent cases [http://www.aclu.org/VotingRights/VotingRights.cfm?ID=10305&amp;c=32], a number of libertarians and [[objectivists]] oppose the ACLU for its support of laws that they view as distinctly anti-liberty, such as [[affirmative action]] and anti-discrimination laws that apply to private property.  One objection held by some libertarians is the belief that private business owners have an inherent right to discriminate against serving customers, or hiring employees, based on criteria such as race or sex. 

Former ACLU member [[Nat Hentoff]] has criticized the organization in a libertarian vein for promoting affirmative action and for supporting what he sees as government protected liberal speech codes enacted on college campuses and the workplace [http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/hentoff092099.asp].

Law professor [[David Bernstein]]'s book &quot;You Can't Say That! The Growing Threat to Civil Liberties from Antidiscrimination Laws&quot; takes the ACLU to task for frequently seeking to undermine expressive rights when they conflict with antidiscrimination laws, as in the 2000 Supreme Court case of [[Boy Scouts of America v. Dale]]. Some libertarians have formed an organization they describe as the &quot;libertarian ACLU&quot; [http://www.lpws.org/spokane/why.htm], the [[Institute for Justice]].

[[Image:Narnia aslan.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Aslan in promotional artwork from the film ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'']]
'''Aslan''' the &quot;Great Lion&quot; is the main character in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' a series of seven fantasy novels for children written by [[C. S. Lewis]]. He appears in all seven books of the series. The word ''aslan'' is [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] for &quot;[[lion]]&quot; and is used as a title for [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]]/[[Seljukids|Seljukid]] and [[Persian Empire]](Turkic) rulers.  The figure of Aslan may have been suggested by a mysterious lion which suddenly appears and disappears at key moments in the novel [[The Place of the Lion]], by Lewis' close friend [[Charles Williams]].

==Christological aspects==
Throughout the series it is often repeated that he is &quot;not a tame lion&quot;, since, despite his gentle and loving nature, he is powerful and can be dangerous. He takes the role of a [[Christ|Christ-like]] figure, though according to Lewis he is not an [[allegorical]] portrayal of Christ, but rather a different, hypothetical,  [[incarnation]] of Christ himself:

:''If Aslan represented the immaterial Deity, he would be an allegorical figure. In reality however he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question, 'What might Christ become like if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours?' This is not allegory at all.''

Thus, Lewis claimed that the Chronicles were not Christian allegory because they are not allegory, not because they are not Christian.

This interpretation is related to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s concept of &quot;[[secondary creation]]&quot; expounded in his [[1947]] essay ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'', reflecting discussions Lewis and Tolkien had in the [[Inklings]] group.

==Role in the Narnia narrative==
{{spoiler}}
In the course of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'', Aslan is put to death by the White Witch on the Stone Table in the place of a traitor - symbolic of the [[Crucifixion]]. He subsequently rises from the dead, and makes appearances in the remaining books in the series. He appears as the creator of Narnia in the prequel ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]''.

When Narnia is destroyed in ''[[The Last Battle]]'', Aslan judges every creature who has died. It turns out his kingdom is the real Narnia and the one that was destroyed was merely a copy.

The books also make reference to an [[Emperor-Over-Sea]], whose son Aslan is said to be; this further highlights his Christ-like status. The Emperor-over-the-Sea is similar to ''[[Eru Ilúvatar]]'' of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], in His separation from His creation.

At various points, Aslan's role as an evangelist for Christian beliefs becomes explicit.  After turning from a lamb (Jesus was often said to be the Lamb of God in the Bible) back into a lion (Christ was often called the Lion of the Tribe of Judea) in [[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader|''The Voyage of the'' Dawn Treader]], he announces he is known by another name in our world, and while that name is not mentioned specifically, the connotations and imagery in Aslan's story strongly suggest that he is referring to Christ.  See the Wikipedia entry on [[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader|''The Voyage of the'' Dawn Treader]] for this description.
{{endspoiler}}

==Portrayals in film and television==
In all three (''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'', ''Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'', ''The Silver Chair'') of the [[BBC]] television serial adaptations of the late [[1980s]] and early [[1990s]], Aslan is voiced by [[Ronald Pickup]], with the costume operated by William Todd Jones.

In the 2005 film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', he is voiced by [[Liam Neeson]].

'''Adobe Systems''' ({{nasdaq|ADBE}}) ({{lse|ABS}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[computer]] [[Computer software|software]] company headquartered in [[San Jose, California]] that was founded in December 1982 by [[John Warnock]] and [[Charles Geschke]]. They founded Adobe after leaving [[Xerox PARC]] in order to further develop and commercialize the [[PostScript]] [[page description language]]. Adobe played a significant role in sparking the [[desktop publishing]] revolution when [[Apple Computer]] licensed PostScript for use in the [[LaserWriter]] [[computer printer|printer]] product line in 1985. The company name ''Adobe'' comes from the Adobe Creek, which ran behind the house of one of the company's founders.

In 2005, Adobe Systems had over 4,000 employees, at least half of whom were located in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in [[Seattle, Washington]]; [[Noida]], [[India]]; and [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]]. Minor Adobe development offices include a location near [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] and in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. The 4,000 count was prior to the [[December 3]], [[2005]] merger with [[Macromedia]] of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]].

==History==
[[Image:Adobe HQ.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Adobe Systems headquarters in San Jose]]
Adobe's first products following PostScript were digital [[Typeface|font]]s. Adobe has continued to be a strong presence in the fonts market: in 1996, the company, in combination with [[Microsoft]], announced the [[OpenType]] font format, and in 2003 Adobe completed the conversion of its library of [[Type 1 font]]s to OpenType.

In the mid-[[1980s]], soon after introducing PostScript, Adobe entered the consumer [[Computer software|software]] market with [[Adobe Illustrator]], a [[vector graphics|vector]]-based drawing program for the [[Apple Macintosh]]. Illustrator was the logical outgrowth of commercializing their in-house font-development software. Additionally, it helped popularize the use of PostScript-enabled [[laser printer]]s. Unlike [[MacDraw]] (then the standard Macintosh vector drawing program), Illustrator described all shapes with more flexible [[Bézier curve]]s, providing a level of accuracy not seen in other programs. Font rendering in Illustrator, however, was left to the Macintosh's [[QuickDraw]] libraries and would not be superseded by a PostScript-like approach until Adobe's own [[Adobe Type Manager]] software was introduced, preceding Apple's eventual adoption of [[TrueType]].

Although Illustrator was an excellent product and continues to be highly valued by the [[prepress]] industry, Adobe introduced what was to become its [[flagship]] product, [[Adobe Photoshop]] for the Macintosh, in 1989. Although Photoshop 1.0 had competitors, it was extremely stable and well-featured&amp;mdash;and Adobe had the resources to market it. The combination enabled Photoshop to soon dominate its market.

Arguably, one of Adobe's few missteps on the Macintosh platform was their failure to develop their own [[desktop publishing]] (DTP) program. Instead, [[Aldus]] with [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]] in 1985 and [[Quark, Inc.|Quark]] with [[QuarkXPress]] in 1987 gained early leads in the DTP market. Adobe was also slow to address the emerging [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] DTP market. In a classic failure to predict the direction of computing, Adobe released a complete version of Illustrator for [[Steve Jobs]]' ill-fated [[NeXT]] system, but a poorly produced version for Windows.

History has been kind to Adobe however, because the company always had licensing fees from the PostScript interpreter to fall back on, Adobe was able to simply outlast many of its rivals in the late 1980s and early [[1990s]], and, like [[Microsoft]], eventually acquired its main competitors or continued to improve its applications until they became industry standards. For reasons unknown, [[Corel]] never leveraged their [[CorelDraw]] product to do professional illustration&amp;mdash;users quietly derided it as something only office users would touch&amp;mdash;so when Illustrator was finally revamped for Windows, prepress users found it too good to ignore. Corel's interest in acquiring [[WordPerfect]] from [[Novell]] Corporation around this time may have proved to be a key distraction. In 1994, Adobe took over Aldus and acquired PageMaker and the [[TIFF]] file format; in 1995 they acquired the long-document DTP application [[FrameMaker]] from Frame Technologies.

Adobe's latest efforts are mainly centered on its [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF). Although sales of [[Adobe Acrobat]], which generates PDF files, were slow to start in the mid-1990s, Adobe continued to develop the product, perceiving its long-term potential for revenues. History has since shown this to be a wise investment. Adobe has also seen several ancillary benefits: PDF provides a common, high-quality data exchange infrastructure for its DTP applications.

Among open software advocates, some see Adobe as overly aggressive. This image was created with their decision to use an encrypted, proprietary format for their high-quality Type 1 fonts, thus allowing them to charge licensing fees for any other company that wanted to produce or use Type 1 fonts. The size of these fees was a factor in Apple's development of their own [[TrueType]] technology as well as Microsoft's decision to license TrueType from Apple. At the presentation at which TrueType was introduced, Adobe head Warnock followed TrueType talks from both Apple and Microsoft VPs, and was near tears as he said that they were being sold &quot;smoke.&quot; In fact, TrueType had definitive advantages: it provided not only full scalability, but also precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines. A few months later Adobe published the Type 1 specification, and soon released the &quot;Adobe Type Manager&quot; software, which allowed for [[WYSIWYG]] scaling of Type 1 fonts on screen, just like TrueType (though without the precise
pixel-level control). However, these moves were too late to stop the rise of TrueType, which quickly became the standard for business and the average Windows user, with Type 1 remaining the standard in the graphics/publishing market.

On [[2005-04-18]] Adobe Systems announced an agreement to acquire its former main rival [[Macromedia]] in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion on the last trading day before the announcement. The acquisition was consummated on [[2005-12-03]].

==Reputation==
In many circles Adobe is considered one of the most principled of the major software companies, and one that treats its large corporate customers and employees well, although customer service for smaller businesses and individuals has often received unfavorable press. Adobe has climbed [[Fortune magazine]]'s rankings as an outstanding place to work over the last several years (2001-03). Adobe was rated the fifth best American company to work for in 2003 and sixth best in 2004. Adobe was ineligible for Fortune's ranking in 2005 due to its major acquisition of Macromedia.

The '''Alexander Technique'''  teaches how to recognize and overcome habituated limitations within a person's manner of movement. The Alexander Technique is usually learned from an ''Alexander teacher'' in one-to-one sessions by an ''Alexander student,'' using specialized hand contact and verbal instructions. The name denotes both the educational methods taught by ''Alexander teachers'' and the individual method practiced by teachers and students of the technique.
It takes its name from [[F. Matthias Alexander]] ([[1869]]&amp;ndash;[[1955]]), a former Shakespearean recitalist, who first observed and formulated its principles during [[1890]] &amp;ndash; [[1900]]. Alexander regarded the empirical scientific method to be the foundation of his work. He used self-observation and reasoning to make effortless the physical acts of every-day movement: sitting, standing, breathing, working with the hands and speaking. He designed his methods to make experimentation and training deliberately repeatable, and to learn in a way that would allow continuing improvement from any starting point.

F.M. Alexander trained teachers of his technique from [[1931]] until [[1955]] in London, UK and from [[1941]] to [[1943]] in Massachusetts, USA, together with his brother, A.R. Alexander ([[1874]]&amp;ndash;[[1947]]), who continued with the training of teachers in the USA until [[1945]]. During his lifetime, F.M. Alexander gained considerable support for his work, including [[John Dewey]], [[Aldous Huxley]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], and scientists [[Raymond Dart]], [[George E. Coghill]], [[Charles Sherrington]], and [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]].

= History =
'''F.M. Alexander''' was a Shakespearean orator who developed problems with his voice. Careful observation with multiple mirrors revealed that he needlessly stiffened his whole body in a particular habitual pattern in preparation to recite or speak. It took ten years of self-observation to successfully apply his original discoveries to solve his voice problem. Eventually, he fashioned a &quot;Technique&quot; to teach others to pass on his experience. His work continues today, extending in a lineage that has expanded from many lifetime dedications.

=The Technique=
==Basic Premises==
The Alexander Technique educates the student's sense of [[kinesthesia]] or [[proprioception]]. This sense is used to internally calibrate one's own bodily location, weight and to judge the effort necessary for moving.

Alexander Technique teachers believe that humans have a built-in proprioceptive blind spot; people become habituated to whatever they repeat. Repetitious circumstances lead people to create habits as they adapt and learn. These habits are both deliberate and non-deliberate responses that include physical movement patterns, coping and learning strategies. The advantage of adapting is that behavior and learning becomes simplified; it becomes possible to meet a given stimulus or interpretation of circumstances with a ready-made reaction. As a person adds one habit onto another, the disadvantage is they may train themselves to also repeat unintentional side effects - the tension, over-compensation and cumulative stress that the Alexander Technique addresses.

Adapting has a further serious drawback: ''habits disappear sensation.'' Using the habit decreases the importance of paying attention to perceptual differences. Also, sensory systems can flood from accommodating too many contradicting habits and intentions. From disuse or flooding, perceptual sensitivity shuts down and eventually become dull and untrustworthy, just as skin becomes numb if the same spot is rubbed for too long. Loss of perceptual awareness encourages mistaken interpretations for the need to choose a particular response. In a panic, all opposing habits can fire off at once, pulling in all directions, sometimes without the person noticing it has happened.

Because habits are designed to become innate, people will commonly experience no sensation of ''doing'' a successfully automated habit. Forgetting what they have trained themselves to now do without thinking, this drawback encourages people to feel convinced that whatever effort or ways they now use to move to respond is customary and necessary, even when it is far from normal. 

How our kinesthetic sense becomes untrustworthy from adapting to needless overcompensating is built into many innocent situations. For instance, if a person often carries a bag on their forearm, he will later find himself holding up his arm when the bag is not on it.  Misunderstanding a teacher's directions, a student may repeat what the teacher knows is unnecessary, but the teacher forgivingly allows the mistake to go by when he should not. A self-taught student may unknowingly adopt useless and later problematic mannerisms. If someone is afraid while learning, adapting can mean he will most likely continue doing the skill fearfully. If someone has healed from a temporary injury, a subtle wincing in anticipation of pain can be automatically continued indefinitely, even though pain has healed. Also due to rapid growth, teenagers often move their own bodies based on inaccurate assumptions of their size and structure.

According to Alexander teachers, few adults in Western culture retain their ability to move freely without needless self-imposed interference. Teachers find that most people assume that they &quot;must&quot; move in the only way they assume is possible. Given an unceasing cumulative demand that unnecessarily stresses the body’s structural design, the price as adults grow older can range from feelings of stress and resignation to very real physical problems, due to movement limitations that could be changed. According to those who teach Alexander Technique, most of the time, giving up a certain activity isn't necessary if a learner is ready to free specific habits that work against the body's structural design.

==Benefits==
As a technique addressing the entirety of a person's activity, the Alexander Technique aims to benefit people of all sorts. Its proponents, including many well known actors, musicians and educators believe that its practice results in improved awareness, objectivity and the connection between body and mind, ease of movement, improved balance, stamina and less muscular tension. Additionally, those who practice it often report that it gives them an enhanced ability to clarify their thinking, observations and the ability to choose new responses.
Proponents further see the technique as a way to use less effort for movement and thus perform more efficiently, feel easier, look more graceful and free themselves from unintentional self-imposed limitations.

It is applied both remedially and in the areas of performing arts and sports. It is taught in performance schools of dance, acting, circus, music, voice and some Olympic sports. Since Alexander Technique is suitable for those at any fitness level, it is also used as remedial movement education to complete recovery and provide pain management. Alexander Technique is a first-hand experience of the reality of body/mind unity. Its principles apply to psychology, creative thinking, learning theory and styles of coaching, training and effective communication for teachers and directors.

Although the Alexander Technique is considered by those in its field to be primarily educational, taught in a student/teacher relationship as compared to being a treatment regimen between client and practitioner, it is regarded by the [[National Health Service|United Kingdom National Health Service]] to offer an alternative and complementary management for many medical complaints. A partial list is: back problems, unlearning and avoiding [[Repetitive Strain Injury]], improving ergonomics, stuttering, speech training and voice loss, mobility for those with [[Parkinson's disease]], posture or balance problems, or to complete recovery from injury as an adjunct to [[Physical therapy]]. It is also been known to help performers with getting past the ''plateau'' effect (despite trying, no improvement,) performance anxiety, getting beyond a supposed &quot;lack of talent&quot; and to sharpen discrimination and description ability. It has also helped people control unwanted reactions, phobias and depression.
Of course, applications are very subjective and personal by nature; many testimonies exist on the Internet. See STAT link below for scientific studies. Note that Alexander Technique is regarded to be a helpful adjunct to traditional medical treatment regimens and not as a substitution for them.

==Reported Effects==
Students often describe the immediate effect of an ''Alexander lesson'' as both being unusual, and also strangely familiar. During hands-on lessons, pupils have reported an immediate feeling of a &quot;state of grace,&quot; despite their inability to evoke or sustain this state by themselves. Other reported experiences include hearing their own voice sounding different, feeling lighter or having a temporary disorientation of where their body is located spatially.

Though most students experience these perceptual paradoxes as feeling good, students are often admonished by teachers to regard their sensations as not worth trying to repeat. Students learn to avoid ''end-gaining,'' meaning, to resist going directly for results using one’s habit. Instead students are to allow themselves the room to use the deliberate new processes of experimenting proscribed by ''the Technique,'' called ''means whereby.'' For this reason students must continue practice of AT without expectation or reinforcement of ''feeling'' themselves changing, because their senses may not yet be awake enough to register the crucial subtle adjustments. Improved sensitivity can be trained or reawakened by sustained practice, but this takes patience. The learner may at different times still paradoxically experience both states; the unusual sensory effects described above during a progressive leap ahead; and a sense of nothing happening when gradual progress is, in fact, taking place.

Evidence of change is sought in verifiable outside feedback; using a mirror; by noting, comparing, or describing differences of the relative location of one's eyes, balance or weight changes; a change in the sound of one's voice or the effects on one’s objectives, props or environment. Alexander teachers have been educated to perceive, observe and articulate very subtle but crucial differences influencing motion, and they offer this education and feedback to their students.

Depending on the causes of limitations, structural posture may or may not improve, but freedom of motion should always improve during the lesson with a teacher. To take improvements away from the class, the dedication of later remembering to attentively experiment is required on the part of the learner. A willingness to experiment is key to gaining continuing results.

==Effective under what circumstances==
Remembering to use Alexander Technique to get its benefits is required, but not a special practice activity; merely an experimental, thinking moment while doing any other action. Of course, the longer these moments of awareness can be sustained, the greater the effect over time. Alexander Technique can be practiced while doing any other activity. Practice at any time while awake will result in its benefits. Curiosity, a willingness to experiment and recognition of gradual improvement are the attitudes that most effectively bring attention to the continuous possible choices of response that momentarily arise. Practice should be unnoticed by others due to the fact that it's an internal process of personal sensory experience.

Unlike many similar self-improvement regimens, the Alexander Technique is '''not''' a series of exercises. Rather, it teaches inter-related principles for human response, such as [[directions]], which are the governing characteristics of how people can use their own bodies easier to perform their objectives. Which motions, actions and criteria someone might apply for an activity that could benefit from practice will range from the most simple and mundane motions to the most strenuously demanding physical challenges.

==Disadvantages==
Alexander Technique may not be effective for everyone. It requires the student to work at a somewhat paradoxical goal that is, at first, based on the teacher's (or classmates') perception of success. Habits are often tied to self-image, emotions and cultural assumptions. The student must be willing and able to challenge the validity and criteria of their assumptions, judgments and motives. Because of this, the road of learning can be rocky. It's difficult to change that which cannot be perceived.

In rare occasions, undoing habits may trigger possibly unpleasant &quot;unresolved&quot; emotions that originally justified the habitual remedies, perhaps requiring additional professional help. Some ingrained habit patterns seem to have a sense of self-preservation that objects to its possible lack of importance.

There can be a time during mid-learning when the student can't yet reliably sustain the new ways of moving he prefers. What used to feel comfortable instead becomes experienced as an unpleasantly heavy, pressured sagging sensation. It's a stage where every posture the student can assume seems to have something wrong with it. Often the student constantly notices other people around them are always stiff and slumping. It seems that once the door to perception is open, there is no going back to unselfconsciousness. If the student feels he cannot continue lessons at this point, perhaps sampling a number of teachers from different teaching styles is advisable rather than quitting altogether.

Alexander Technique will not solve structural problems such as [[arthritis]] or alter bone structure. However, many adult students have reported a gaining an inch or so in height after a few months of regular lessons.

===Scientific Proof===
Proof the Alexander Technique works has only been verified in rare previous and current scientific research. But results in neuroscience and current movement gait lab research on the effects and function of body motion are promising. (See STAT links.) Meanwhile, UK medical communities recognize the effectiveness of the ''Technique,'' though is still often classified as pseudo-scientific in other countries.

===Learning time===
Progress in learning is unlimited, but commonly slow; often taking a significant commitment of months, even years of discipline. Most teachers consider twenty to forty lessons to be required for learning to use it personally.  Speed of learning seems to depend on the motivation to shed outdated habits, and the persistence of the learner to confront the power of their own habits with resolve, clear thinking and new responses. During daily lessons in a workshop environment, a rare fast learner can gain rapid functionality in a matter of a few weeks. The fastest learners are often people who are motivated by gaining freedom from chronic pain, or someone recovering from injury who can now again devote themselves to a beloved art or skill. The reason Alexander Technique takes so long to learn is because the kinesthetic sense is often the most &quot;taken for granted&quot; and habitually ingrained. The student is often without words for the qualities in themselves that are changing.

=Learning and Teaching=
Teachers train “pupils” in a personalized, living anatomy lesson. Most use a specialized hands-on technique of guided modeling to show what they mean. Even if only briefly for group classes, movement is guided with very light, one-on-one hand contact, usually about the student's head, neck and back. The value of effortlessness is advocated. Coaching the substitution of more appropriate, specific ways to detour limitations are also suggested. As anyone knows who has tried substitution strategies against a habit, there are often more complex paradoxes involved, because habits can be tricky. Alexander Technique addresses these concerns, tailoring how to establish personally constructive experimentation uniquely for each student.

Most commonly at the beginning of lessons, teachers may suggest activities that are routine, such as walking or sitting. For part of the lesson, some teachers have learners lie on a table, so the student can experience the principles in action without having to pay attention to maintaining balance, called ''table work.'' ''Working on oneself'' while lying semi-supine with knees up is taught to be used while taking a break during the student's workday. Depending on the student's purposes, the teacher might later suggest simulating a particularly stressful situation for using Alexander Technique under pressure, such as acting, public speaking, shouting or other demanding performance.

==Learning Environments==
Teaching methods vary; all have in common guided discovery of easier, more positive ways to carry intention into physical action and how to recognize and prevent outdated habits from derailing intended results. To begin lessons, there is no prerequisite level of fitness or movement ability. Alexander Technique is most often taught in private lessons. Group, shared lessons and workshops are recently becoming more common - especially as an adjunct to a specialized art, sport or skill and as required curriculum in music &amp; drama colleges.

Because the Alexander Technique can be taught and practiced during any activity, some teachers leave the choice of activity up to the student. Many Alexander teachers also have additional specialties; such as teaching children in grade school, [[Repetitive strain injury]] or pain management. Some teach Alexander Technique with an additional professional skill, such as being a speech or physical therapist or yoga teacher. ''AT'' may also be included as an adjunct to improve a sport, as in horsemanship, running or golf. However, the Alexander teacher does not need to be trained in the specific skill, sport or activity for its benefits to be experienced.

==Teacher Training==
Training for being a teacher of Alexander Technique involves more than 1600+ hours of classes over at least a three-year period. Teacher trainees must qualify to graduate; attendance is not a guarantee of becoming a teacher. Trainees are evaluated for the presence of a signature of effortlessness and freedom in themselves and the quality of their touch. Alexander Technique's unexpected poise should be an immediate shared fact for both teacher and student in every hands-on ''Alexander lesson.'' After qualifying, most professional teaching associations require continuing development courses.

The UK professional Alexander teaching organizations and some trained by them believe the public should beware of inadequately trained impostors, because there are no laws that require legal certification of AT teachers. The necessary skill to teach is impossible to &quot;fake&quot; - a fact obviously witnessed by those with the professional skill to see it in action but not by the general public. Regardless of what other ''body science'' or ''holistic therapy'' experience someone who claims Alexander Technique knowledge may have, if he has not qualified at a professional teacher-training course in an establishment approved by a recognized professional AT organization, he is not a certified professional Alexander teacher. Professional organizations generally advise checking references of any teacher you might consider studying with.

===The Importance Attached To Learning From An Alexander Teacher===
F.M. Alexander and his brother A.R. Alexander often stressed that ''The Technique'' could not be acquired without the active cognitive participation of a student and the help of a suitably qualified instructor trained in the hands-on technique, deceptive self awareness being the significant effect of ''sensory adaptation.'' Most Alexander teachers today agree, but F.M. and A.R. did it first alone. So theoretically it is possible to learn without a teacher, although some properly trained help obviates many common pitfalls.

Alexander Technique is difficult to describe and teach in words because it requires description of subjective kinesthetic sensations and momentary situations, as well as the ability to perceive them. Most people have little conscious awareness of kinesthetic sensation and not much to say if asked to describe what happens as they move. The possibility of moving in an easier way most often emerges as a surprise from underneath a learner's current sensory ability to command it on purpose. It is needlessly difficult to attempt to learn to apply the Alexander Technique for oneself simply by reading about it.

Most ''Alexander teachers'' are of the professional opinion that twenty to forty individual lessons are required to learn to use the Technique for yourself. Other teachers believe that group workshops are at least as effective as individual lessons, because camaraderie is supportive, and group teaching usually involves some individual hands-on &quot;turns&quot; directly with the teacher as the class watches. A few teachers believe it is entirely possible to learn and continue to experiment with the basic principles on one's own. Everyone in the field, including other students, agree that having at least a few one-to-one sessions with a trained teacher is useful to appreciate how AT works and to get the benefits it offers.

Availability of Alexander teachers is limited, except in the United Kingdom, where the profession is in the process of being included in the [[Complementary and alternative medicine]] of the [[National Health Service|UK National Health Service]]. Only a handful of teachers who were personally trained by the founder are still living. '''Alexander Technique''' has the lifetime dedication from less than five thousand teachers worldwide, usually grouped in associated professional societies.

Alexander teachers differ in teaching style. Differences in teaching approaches evolved as various teachers originated what they believed constituted more effective teaching.  Usually, a style of teaching is not just an imitation of training methods, but integrates many such personal lifetime discoveries. It's rare that a teacher can or will articulate the deliberate reasoning behind their teaching variations. Traditionalists believe that spending time on general intellectual concepts may encourage their student's misuse. These teachers may dodge discussions of principles until the student can have the conversation without their old habits of speaking.

==In-depth principles==
Many of the principles of Alexander Technique are unique concepts. As has been mentioned previously, human senses are built to adapt to continuous messages sent by the brain. '''Repetition makes perceptual sensation disappear'''. Keeping muscles contracted when they don't need to be used compares to leaving the kitchen light on continuously because it so often needs to be on - which is a waste of energy. This principle was originally called ''debauchery''. It was later referred to as ''sensory adaptation'' by behavioral scientists. To unlearn these habits, a prerequisite seems to be a willingness to welcome experimentation and unfamiliarity; what is new feels strange.

Another unique concept is a specialized use of the word ''Inhibition.'' Many Alexander teachers believe this concept to be the foundation of Alexander Technique. It is possible to learn to recognize and prevent a habitual patterned reaction and choose differently. As a carnivore stalking prey inhibits its natural urges in order to choose a deliberate leap for an effective attack, an unwanted habitual urge can be deliberately and strategically ''inhibited.'' Suggested practical means to effectively subvert a particular unwanted habit vary with each Alexander teacher's experience. Sidestepping, stalling, tricking, boring the old habitual solution - anything is fair game to get the old habit to disengage or entirely prevent it, leaving the freedom to try something different, something easier.

A stiffening of the neck in a startle response, head down and back narrowed was discovered by Alexander to be the source of his self-imposed limitations. To address these indirectly rather than fight them, he originated an action called [[Direction]] which is an ingredient of his principle of [[Primary Control]]. People who direct themselves visualize movement and mentally guide the flow of using force through their body. Rather than gunning the motor and muscling their way through an activity, people who direct use their mind to guide or envision their own coordinated dynamic expansion while moving. By doing so, the body's reflexive coordination seems to spontaneously recover from habit to gracefully handle the action by lengthening as if by itself.

The more inclusive principle of [[Primary Control]] shows the head's lightest initiation of moving is its structural balancing act, cradled at the top of the spine. By integrating attention, using direction and refusing habit, the whole body can follow any of the smallest initiation of motion with its own easiest qualities of movement. To the extent the learner can also pay attention to what they are doing, their suspended goal improves. Occasionally the result is a significant practical insight about the suspended goal, as refreshed senses give new sensory information.

===Sample lesson===
The Alexander Technique principles say that it is possible to learn to insert a new choice before a habitual reaction takes over, but how is this actually done? The principles may be put together in any sequence, not necessarily in this order. What follows is an example lesson.

First, choosing some sort of movement to practice with is required. Sitting down or walking is a commonly selected activity. The teacher prompts the student how to observe him or herself during action. Students are asked to describe without value judgments and are encouraged to avoid being self-chastising. Habits are not demonized.

A basic activity is to identify and stop habitual interference so a freer capacity to respond can reassert itself. Toward leaving out habit, the goal of the chosen action or motion is temporarily suspended, so motivation for immediate results does not encourage the habit to jump in to helpfully answer the urge to respond. Intercepting unnecessary habits might also be made easier by creating an arbitrary beginning moment of intentional choice.

Once a sample activity is observed and described, the teacher and student craft experiments to avoid habitual interference, usually by slowing down reaction time. In keeping with the ''sensory adaptation'' principle, customary kinesthetic orientation and preparation assumed necessary is repeatedly noted to be unnecessary. The teacher shows how the head, neck and back together can ''lengthen'' to increase capacity for freedom of movement. The teacher may use their hands as &quot;training wheels&quot; to help the student perceive exactly when their habit is interfering - often during movement preparation. Teachers bring a student's attention to pivotal timing issues and specific qualities of motion that influences freedom. Teachers may experiment alongside students; modeling the process they would prefer the student to emulate.

Sometimes the effect of this prevention of habit feels immediately strange or disorienting to the student. The teacher steadies and encourages the student to resist a need to go back down into the familiar habit and to tolerate additional unfamiliarity for longer periods of time.

A sensation termed ''Do-less-ness'' may be used as the new measure of success. Just as often seeking any results is also suspended, because the ability to sense subtle perceptual differences may have become dulled from ''sensory adaptation.''

Usually, this is all that is required to be practiced in the lesson. Sometimes habits are trickier and remedies to detour habit are crafted and used. Some of these strategies are directly prescribed by F.M. Alexander's historic examples, but many may be invented on the spot.

Now that the student's senses are not being dampened by habit, a discovery about the suspended objective of the activity may emerge at this time. These discoveries are noted and integrated into repeated experimentation to make them more reliable. It is important that this observing of results comes after doing the preventing and moving, not before; otherwise the unwanted habits can take back control.

When additional results are desired, a similar process of questioning, experimenting and observing possible results is again used (or the principles recombined in another order, tailored for a student's needs. Some students need to suspend expectation of results entirely.) After repeated successes from much experimentation, hopefully a learner's tolerance for unfamiliarity increases. Using this Alexander Technique process never stops feeling surprising.

'''Andrea Alciato''' (1492-1550), was a [[jurist]] born in [[Alzano]], near [[Milan]], [[Italy]] on the [[1492]]-[[January 12|01-12]].   Alciato settled in France in the early [[16th century]]. He displayed great literary skill in his exposition of the laws, and was one of the first to interpret the civil law by the history, languages and literature of antiquity, and to substitute original research for the servile interpretations of the glossators. He published many legal works, and some annotations on Tacitus. Alciato is most famous for his ''[[Emblemata]],'' published in dozens of editions from 1531 onward. This collection of short Latin verse texts and accompanying woodcuts created an entire European genre, the [[emblem book]], which attained enormous popularity in continental Europe and Britain.

Andrea Alicato died at [[Pavia]] in [[1550]].

Alciati's history of Milan, under the title ''Rerum Potriae, seu Historiae Mediolanensis, Libri IV''., was published posthumously at Milan in 1625.

'''Arizona''' {{IPA|/&amp;#716;&amp;#603;&amp;#633;.&amp;#618;&amp;#712;zon.&amp;#601;/}} is a large [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Western_United_States|western]] [[United States]]. It is best known for its [[desert]] landscape, which includes [[cacti]]. Arizona is also known for its exceptionally hot summers and mild winters. Less well known is the pine-covered high country in the north-central portion of the state, which contrasts with the lower deserts of the state.

Arizona is one of the [[Four Corners (United States)|Four Corners]] states, situated south and east of the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]]. It borders [[New Mexico]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], [[California]], touches [[Colorado]], and has a 389-mile (626 km) [[international border]] with [[Mexico]]. Arizona is the sixth largest state in area, after [[New Mexico]] and before [[Nevada]]. Aside from the [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]], a number of other [[National Forest]]s, [[National parks (United States)|Parks]], [[National parks (United States)|Monuments]], and [[Indian reservation]]s are located in the state. Arizona was the 48th state admitted into the U.S. (1912), and the last of the [[Continental United States|contiguous states]] admitted.

Three ships named [[USS Arizona]] have been named in honor of the state, although only [[USS Arizona (BB-39)]] was so named after statehood was achieved.

==Origin of the name==
Historians disagree about the [[etymology|origin]] of the name &quot;Arizona&quot; and its attachment to the region.  Two possible derivations are:
*[[O'odham language|O'odham]] words &quot;al&amp;#301; &amp;#7779;on&quot; (&quot;small spring&quot;), actually the name of a town which is called &quot;Arizonac&quot; in English. Arizonac is a small town about eight miles (12 km) south of the [[U.S.-Mexico border|United States&amp;ndash;Mexican border]]. Historically, it may have been &quot;al&amp;#301; son&quot; or even &quot;al&amp;#301; sona&quot;. The O'odham &quot;l&quot; is a [[voiced alveolar lateral fricative]], which might sound to a Spanish or English speaker like an &quot;r&quot; sound. Later in the mid [[18th century]] Spanish missionaries changed Father [[Eusebio Francisco Kino]]'s maps of the area; they renamed the town Arizonac as Arizona. As the maps were republished and circulated in [[Europe]], the name Arizona became attached to the whole northern part of [[New Spain]].
*[[Spanish language|Spanish]] words &quot;árida zona&quot; (&quot;arid zone&quot;) This would be grammatically incorrect however, since in Spanish, the noun precedes the adjective.

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Arizona]]''

Beyond its original [[Native Americans in the United States|native]] inhabitants, [[Marcos de Niza]], a [[Franciscan]], explored the area in [[1539]]. [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado|Coronado]]'s expedition entered the area in [[1540]]&amp;ndash;[[1542|42]] during its search for [[Quivira and Cíbola|Cíbola]]. Father Kino developed a chain of missions and taught the Indians [[Christianity]] in [[Pimería Alta]] (now southern Arizona and northern [[Sonora]]) in the [[1690s]] and early [[1700s]]. [[Spain]] founded fortified towns (presidios) at Tubac in [[1752]] and Tucson in [[1775]]. All of what is now Arizona became part of Mexico's northwest frontier upon the Mexican assertion of independence from Spain in [[1810]]. The United States took possession of most of Arizona at the end of the [[Mexican War]] in [[1848]]. In [[1853]] the land below the [[Gila River]] was acquired from Mexico in the [[Gadsden Purchase]]. Arizona was administered as part of the Territory of New Mexico until it was organized into a separate territory on [[February 24]], [[1863]].  

[[Brigham Young]] sent [[Mormon]]s to Arizona in the mid to late [[1800s]]. They founded [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], [[Snowflake, Arizona|Snowflake]], [[Heber-Overgaard, Arizona|Heber]], [[Safford, Arizona|Safford]] and other towns. They also settled in the [[Phoenix Valley]] (or &quot;Valley of the Sun&quot;), [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], among other areas.  

Arizona was the site of a [[Germany|German]] and [[Italy|Italian]] prisoner of war camp during [[World War II|WWII]]. The site was purchased after the war by the Maytag family, and is currently utilized as the [[Phoenix Zoo]].  A [[Japan|Japanese]] internment camp was located on [[Mount Lemmon]], just outside of the state's southeastern city of Tucson.

Arizona became a U.S. state on [[February 14]], [[1912]].

[[Image:AZ_capitol.jpg|thumb|left|Arizona State Capitol, Phoenix]]

The state capitol of Arizona is in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. The original capitol building, with its distinctive copper dome, was dedicated in 1901 (construction was completed for $136,000 in 1900), when the area was still a territory, and became the official state capitol with Arizona's admission to the union in 1912.

Separate legislative buildings for the [[Arizona House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Arizona Senate|Senate]] were dedicated in 1960, and an Executive Office Building was dedicated in 1974 (the ninth floor of this building is where the Office of the Governor is located). The original capitol building was converted into a museum.

The capitol complex is fronted and highlighted by the richly landscaped [[Wesley Bolin Memorial Park]], named after [[Wesley Bolin]], a governor who died in office in the 1970's. Numerous monuments and memorials are on the site, including the anchor and signal mast from the [[USS Arizona]] (one of the U.S. Navy ships sunk in Pearl Harbor); a granite version of the [[Ten Commandments]]; and the [[Arizona Vietnam Veterans' Memorial]].

Arizona's legislature is [[bicameral]] (like the legislature of every other state except [[Nebraska]]) and consists of a thirty-member [[Arizona Senate|Senate]] and a 60-member [[Arizona House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Legislators are elected for two-year terms. 

Each Legislature covers a two-year period. The first session following the general election is known as the first regular session, and the session convening in the second year is known as the second regular session. Each regular session begins on the second Monday in January and adjourns sine die (i.e., terminates for the year) no later than Saturday of the week in which the 100th day from the beginning of the regular session falls. The President of the Senate and Speaker of the House, by rule, may extend the session up to seven additional days. Thereafter the session can only be extended by a majority vote of members present of each house.

The majority party is the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], which has held power since [[1950]]. The [[2002]] budget of the Arizona state legislature was $14.3 billion, while the executive budget was $13.8 billion. Besides the money spent on state agencies, money has also been allocated for tax cuts, pay raises for government employees, and health insurance for government employees. The executive budget has allocated money to previously passed legislation. Arizona state senators and representatives are elected for two year terms and there are no terms limits. However, no more than four terms may be served consecutively.

Arizona's [[executive branch]] is headed by a governor elected for a four-year term. The governor may serve any number of terms, though no more than two in a row.  The current Governor of Arizona is [[Janet Napolitano]], a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]].  She has been governor since [[2003]]. 

''See:[[List of Arizona Governors]]''

The two U.S. Senators from Arizona are Senator [[John McCain]] (Republican) and Senator [[Jon Kyl]] (Republican).

Arizona's representatives in the United States House of Representatives are [[Rick Renzi]] (R-1), [[Trent Franks]] (R-2), [[John Shadegg]] (R-3), [[Ed Pastor]] (D-4), [[J.D. Hayworth]] (R-5), [[Jeff Flake]] (R-6), [[Raul Grijalva]] (D-7), and [[Jim Kolbe]] (R-8).  Arizona gained two seats in the House of Representatives due to [[redistricting]] based on [[United_States_2000_census|Census 2000]].

While the Republican Party has dominated Arizona politics since the [[1950s]], the state did support one Democratic presidential candidate in that time, [[Bill Clinton]] in [[1996]].  In [[2004]], [[George W. Bush]] won the state's ten [[electoral vote|electoral votes]] by a margin of 11 percentage points with 54.9 percent of the vote.  The state's concentration of Democrats is strongest in the City of Tucson (excluding Tucson's historically Republican-dominated suburbs), Yuma, and [[Santa Cruz County, Arizona|Santa Cruz]] and [[Apache County, Arizona|Apache]] counties.

Like other states of the Southwest, Arizona has an abundance of topographical characteristics in addition to its [[desert]] climes.  More than half of the state features [[mountains]] and [[plateaus]] and contains the largest stand of Ponderosa pine in the [[United States]].  The [[Mogollon Rim]], a 600&amp;nbsp;meter (2000-foot) [[escarpment]], cuts across the central section of the state and marks the southwestern edge of the [[Colorado Plateau]], where the state experienced its [[Rodeo-Chediski fire|worst forest fire ever]] in [[2002]].  Arizona belongs firmly within the [[Basin and Range Province]] of North America.  The region was shaped by prehistoric [[volcanism]], followed by a cooling-off and related subsidence.  The entire region is slowly sinking.

[[Image:Colorado River from Desert View-1000px.jpeg|thumb|left|The Grand Canyon.]]

The [[Grand Canyon]] is a colorful, steep-sided [[gorge]], carved by the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]], in northern Arizona. The canyon is one of the [[seven natural wonders of the world]] and is largely contained in the [[Grand Canyon National Park]]&amp;mdash;one of the first [[national parks]] in the [[United States]]. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was a major proponent of the Grand Canyon area, visiting on numerous occasions to hunt [[mountain lion]] and enjoy the breathtaking scenery.

The Canyon, created by the [[Colorado River]] cutting a channel over millions of years, is about 277 miles (446 km) long, ranges in width from 4 to 18 miles (6 to 29 kilometers) and attains a depth of more than 1 mile (1.6 km). Nearly 2 billion years of the [[Earth]]'s history has been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut through layer after layer of [[sediment]] as the [[Colorado Plateau]]s have uplifted. 

Arizona does not observe [[Daylight saving time|DST]], except in the [[Navajo Nation]] located in the northeastern region of the state.

==Art==
Arizona has featured a continuous string of dancing and performing groups of many ethnicities. The state is a recognized center of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] art, with a number of galleries such as the [[Heard Museum]] showcasing historical and contemporary works. [[Sedona]] and [[Tubac]] are known as budding artist colonies, and small arts scenes exist in the larger cities and near the state universities.

Many tourist souvenirs produced in Arizona or by its residents display characteristic images, such as sunsets, coyotes, and desert plants. Several major Hollywood films, such as ''[[U-Turn]]'', ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'', ''[[Just One of the Guys]]'', ''[[Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', and ''[[Raising Arizona]]'' have been made there (as indeed have many [[Westerns]]).

==Climate==
Due to its large area and variations in elevation, the state has a wide variety of climates.  In the lower elevations, the climate is primarily desert, with mild winters and hot summers.  
Typically, from late fall to early spring, the weather is mild, averaging a minimum of 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C).  November through February are the coldest months with temperatures typically ranging from 40&amp;ndash;75 degrees Fahrenheit (4&amp;ndash;24&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C), although occasional frosts are not uncommon.  About midway through February, the temperatures start to rise again with sunny warm days, and cool breezy nights. The summer months of May through August bring a dry heat ranging from 90&amp;ndash;100 degrees Fahrenheit (32&amp;ndash;38&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C), with occasional high temperatures exceeding 125 °F (52&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C) having been observed in the desert area.  Due to the primarily dry climate, large temperature swings often occur between day and night, with some as large as 50 °F (10&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C) in the summer months.  

However, the northern third of Arizona is a plateau at significantly higher altitudes than the lower desert, and has an appreciably cooler climate, with cold winters and mild summers.  Extreme cold temperatures are not unknown; cold air systems from the northern states and [[Canada]] occasionally push into the state, bringing temperatures below 0 °F (-18&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C) to the higher parts of the state.  

Monsoon season in Arizona is from the end of July through August. Monsoon season storms bring lightning, thunderstorms, wind, and torrential, if usually brief, downpours. It is rare for tornadoes to occur in Arizona. &lt;!-- how much precipitation is missing--&gt;

Indicative of the variation in climate, Arizona is the state which has both the metropolitan area with the most days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C) (Phoenix), and the metropolitan area in the lower 48 states with the most days with a low temperature below freezing (Flagstaff).

==Economy==
[[Image:AZlicenseplt.gif|thumb|right|Current Arizona License Plate. Courtesy Arizona DOT/MVD]]

The 2004 total [[gross state product]] was $187.27 billion.  If Arizona were an independent country, it would have the 61&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; largest economy in the world ([http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html CIA - The World Factbook]).  This figure gives Arizona a larger economy than most other countries, including [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Ireland]], [[Finland]], and [[New Zealand]].  Arizona currently has the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; largest economy among states in the [[U.S.]].   
[[Image:wiki_arizona.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Greetings from Arizona]]
The state's [[per capita income]] is $27,232, 39&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the U.S.  Early in its history, Arizona's economy relied on the &quot;Five C's&quot;: [[copper]], [[cotton]], [[cattle]], [[citrus]], and [[climate]] ([[tourism]]).  At one point Arizona was the largest producer of cotton in the country.  Copper is still extensively mined from many expansive open-pit and underground mines, accounting for two-thirds of the nation's output.

[[Image:Entering Arizona on I-10 Westbound.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Entering Arizona on I-10 from New Mexico]]

The state government is the Arizona's largest employer, while [[Wal-Mart]] is the state's largest private employer, with 17,343 employees ([[2003]]). Arizona lost much of its comparative advantage as a [[high-tech]] industry leader between [[1990]] and [[2001]], according to a state [http://www.commerce.state.az.us/ Department of Commerce] report. 

In [[2001]], 161,166 Arizonans were employed in the high-tech sector, accounting for about 8.3 percent of total private-sector employment of more than 1.9 million. High-tech payroll in 2001 was $2.2 billion, or 14.7 percent of the private-sector total. High-tech employment was led by [[Computer software|software]] and [[computers]], with 34,314; [[electronics]] components manufacturing, 30,358; [[aerospace]] manufacturing, 25,641; architectural and engineering services, 21,378; telecommunications, 21,224; and instruments manufacturing, 13,056.

As of 2005, Arizona has an estimated population of 5,939,292, which is an increase of 199,413, or 3.5%, from the prior year and an increase of 808,660, or 15.8%, since the year 2000.  This includes a natural increase since the last census of 241,732 people (that is 462,739 births minus 221,007 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 576,238 people into the state.  Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 168,078 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 408,160 people.

The racial breakdown of the state is as follows:
*63.8% [[Whites|White]] non-Hispanic
*25.3% [[Hispanics|Hispanic]]

Only [[California]] has more Indians than Arizona, and Arizona has slightly more Indians than [[Oklahoma]] [http://eire.census.gov/popest/data/states/ST-EST2002-ASRO-03.php].

The largest ancestry groups in Arizona are [[Mexico|Mexican]] (21 percent), [[Germany|German]], [[England|English]], [[Ireland|Irish]], and [[American Indian]]. The southern and central parts of the state are heavily Mexican-American, especially in Yuma and Santa Cruz counties. The north-central and northwestern counties are largely inhabited by residents of English ancestry. The northeastern part of Arizona has many American Indians.

Arizona is projected to become a [[minority-majority]] state by the year 2035, if current population growth trends continue. In 2003, for the first time, there were more Hispanic births in the state than white non-Hispanic births.

As of 2000, 74.1% of Arizona residents age 5 and older speak [[English language|English]] at home and 19.5% speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [[Navajo language|Navajo]] is the third most spoken language at 1.9%, followed by Other Native North American languages at 0.6% and [[German language|German]] at 0.5%.

==Education==
'''Universities'''

Higher education in Arizona is governed at the university level by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]] or the ABOR, a 12-member body. According to information published by the ABOR office and available on their Web site, eight volunteer members are appointed by the Governor to staggered eight-year terms; two students serve on the Board for two-year appointments, with the first year being a nonvoting apprentice year. The Governor and the Superintendent of Public Instruction serve as voting ex-officio members. The ABOR provides &quot;policy guidance&quot; and oversight to the three major degree-granting universities, as provided for by Title 15 of the [[Arizona Revised Statutes]].

'''Community colleges'''

Community colleges in Arizona were governed historically by a separate statewide Board of Directors, but a bill passed in the 2002 regular session of the Legislature (HB 2710, which later became ARS 15-1444) transferred almost all oversight authority to individual community college districts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''apparent magnitude''' ('''''m''''') of a [[star]], [[planet]] or other celestial body is a [[measurement|measure]] of its apparent [[brightness]] as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter the object appears, the lower the numerical value of its '''magnitude'''.

The scale upon which magnitude is measured has its origin in the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] practice of dividing those stars visible to the naked eye into six ''magnitudes''. The brightest stars were said to be of first magnitude (''m'' =  1), while the faintest were of sixth magnitude (''m'' =  6), the limit of [[human]] [[visual perception]] (without the aid of a [[telescope]]). Each grade of magnitude was considered to be twice the brightness of the following grade. This somewhat crude method of indicating the brightness of stars was popularized by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'', and is generally believed to have originated with [[Hipparchus (astronomer)|Hipparchus]]. This original system did not measure the magnitude of the [[Sun]]. Because the response of the eye to light is logarithmic, the resulting scale is also logarithmic.

In [[1856]], [[Norman Robert Pogson|Pogson]] formalized the system by defining a typical first magnitude star as a star that is 100 times as bright as a typical sixth magnitude star; thus, a first magnitude star is about 2.512 times as bright as a second magnitude star. The fifth root of 100, an [[irrational number]] about (2.512) is known as ''Pogson's Ratio''. Pogson's scale was originally fixed by assigning [[Polaris]] a magnitude of 2. Astronomers later discovered that Polaris is slightly variable, so they first switched to [[Vega]] as the standard reference star, and then switched to using tabulated zero points for the measured fluxes (see second Reference below). The magnitude depends on the wavelength band (see below). 

The modern system is no longer limited to 6 magnitudes or only to visible light.  Very bright objects have ''negative'' magnitudes. For example, [[Sirius]], the brightest star of the [[celestial sphere]], has an apparent magnitude of &amp;minus;1.44 to &amp;minus;1.46. The modern scale includes the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]]; the full Moon has an apparent magnitude of &amp;minus;12.6 and the Sun has an apparent magnitude of &amp;minus;26.8. [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] has located stars with magnitudes of 30 at visible wavelengths and the [[Keck telescopes]] have located similarly faint stars in the infrared.

These are only approximate values at visible wavelengths (in reality the values depend on the precise bandpass used) &amp;mdash; see [[Airglow#How_to_calculate_the_effects_of_airglow|airglow]] for more details of telescope sensitivity.

As the amount of light received actually depends on the thickness of the [[celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] in the line of sight to the object, the apparent magnitudes are normalized to the value it would have outside the atmosphere. The dimmer an object appears, the higher its apparent magnitude. Note that apparent brightness is not equal to actual brightness &amp;mdash; an extremely bright object may appear quite dim, if it is far away. The rate at which apparent brightness changes, as the distance from an object increases, is [[calculation|calculated]] by the [[inverse-square law]] (at cosmological distance scales, this is no longer quite true because of the [[curvature of space]]). The [[absolute magnitude]], ''M'', of a star or [[galaxy]] is the apparent magnitude it would have if it were 10 [[parsec]]s (~ 32 [[lightyears]]) away; that of a planet (or other solar system body) is the apparent magnitude it would have if it were 1 [[astronomical unit]] away from both the [[Sun]] and [[Earth]]. The absolute magnitude of the Sun is  4.83 in the V band (yellow)  and  5.48 in the B band (blue).

The apparent magnitude in the band x can be defined as

:&lt;math&gt;m_{x}= -2.5 \log_{10} (F_x)  +  C\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_x\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the observed [[flux]] in the band x,
and &lt;math&gt;C\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a constant that depends on the units of the flux and the band. The constant &lt;math&gt;C\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is defined in [[Apparent_magnitude#References|Aller et al 1982]] for the most commonly used system.

The second thing to notice is that the scale is [[logarithm]]ic: the relative brightness of two objects is determined by the difference of their magnitudes. For example, a difference of 3.2 means that one object is about 19 times as bright as the other, because Pogson's ratio raised to the power 3.2 is 19.054607...
The logarithmic nature of the scale is due to the fact of the human [[eye]] itself having a logarithmic response, see [[Weber-Fechner law]].

Magnitude is complicated by the fact that light is not [[monochromatic]]. The sensitivity of a light detector varies according to the wavelength of the light, and the way in which it varies depends on the type of light detector. For this reason, it is necessary to specify how the magnitude is measured in order for the value to be meaningful. For this purpose the UBV system is widely used, in which the magnitude is measured in three different wavelength bands: U (centred at about 350 nm, in the near [[ultraviolet]]), B (about 435 nm, in the blue region) and V (about 555 nm, in the middle of the human visual range in daylight). The V band was chosen for spectral purposes and gives magnitudes closely corresponding to those seen by the light-adapted human eye, and when an apparent magnitude is given without any further qualification, it is usually the V magnitude that is meant, more or less the same as '''visual magnitude'''.

Since cooler stars, such as [[red giant]]s and [[red dwarf]]s, emit little energy in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum their power is often under-represented by the UBV scale. Indeed, some [[stellar classification|L and T class]] stars have an estimated magnitude of well over 100, since they emit extremely little visible light, but are strongest in [[infrared]].

Measures of magnitude need cautious treatment and it is extremely important to measure like with like. On early 20th-century and older orthochromatic (blue-sensitive) [[photographic film]], the relative brightnesses of the blue [[supergiant]] [[Rigel]] and the red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] irregular variable star (at maximum) are reversed compared to what our eyes see since this archaic film is more sensitive to blue light than it is to red light.  Magnitudes obtained from this method are known as [[photographic magnitude]]s, and are now considered obsolete.

For objects within our Galaxy with a given [[absolute magnitude]], 5 is added to the apparent magnitude for every tenfold increase in the distance to the object. This relationship does not apply for objects at very great distances (far beyond our galaxy), since a correction for [[General Relativity]] must then be taken into account due to the non-Euclidean nature of space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[astronomy]], '''absolute magnitude''' is the [[apparent magnitude]], ''m'', an object would have if it were at a standard [[luminosity distance]] away from us. It allows the overall brightnesses of objects to be compared without regard to distance.

The absolute magnitude uses the same convention as the visual magnitude, with a ~2.512&lt;!--- exact = 100**(1/5) ---&gt; difference in [[brightness]] between step rates (because 2.512&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 100). The [[Milky Way]], for example, has an absolute magnitude of about &amp;minus;20.5. So a [[quasar]] at an absolute magnitude of &amp;minus;25.5 is 100 times brighter than our [[galaxy]]. If this particular quasar and our galaxy could be seen side by side at the same distance, the quasar would be 5 magnitudes (or 100 times) brighter than our galaxy.

== Absolute Magnitude for stars and galaxies ('''''M''''') ==

In stellar and galactic astronomy, the standard [[distance]] is 10 [[parsec|parsecs]] (about 32.616 [[light year|light years]], or 3&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; [[kilometre]]s). A star at ten parsecs has a parallax of 0.1&quot; (100 milli arc seconds).

In defining absolute magnitude it is necessary to specify the type of [[electromagnetic radiation]] being [[measurement|measured]]. When referring to total [[energy]] output, the proper term is '''bolometric magnitude'''. The dimmer an object (at a distance of 10 parsecs) would appear, the higher its absolute magnitude. The lower an object's absolute magnitude, the higher its [[luminosity]]. A [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[equation]] [[Relation (mathematics)|relates]] apparent magnitude with absolute magnitude, via [[parallax]].

Many stars visible to the naked eye have an absolute magnitude which is capable of casting [[shadow]]s from a distance of 10 parsecs; [[Rigel]] (&amp;minus;7.0), [[Deneb]] (&amp;minus;7.2), [[Naos]] (&amp;minus;7.3), and [[Betelgeuse]] (&amp;minus;5.6).

For comparison, [[Sirius]] has an absolute magnitude of 1.4 and the [[Sun]] has an absolute visual magnitude of 4.83 (it actually serves as a reference point).

Absolute magnitudes for stars generally [[range]] from &amp;minus;10 to +17. The absolute magnitude for galaxies can be much lower (brighter). For example, the giant [[elliptical galaxy]] [[Elliptical Galaxy M87|M87]] has an absolute magnitude of &amp;minus;22.

=== Computation ===

You can compute the absolute magnitude &lt;math&gt;M\!\,&lt;/math&gt; of a star given its [[apparent magnitude]] &lt;math&gt;m\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and [[luminosity distance]] &lt;math&gt;D_L\!\,&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; M = m - 5 (\log_{10}{D_L} - 1)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D_L\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the stars luminosity distance in [[parsecs]], which are (&amp;#8776; 3.2616 [[light-year]]s)

For nearby astronomical objects (such as stars in our galaxy) the [[luminosity distance]] ''D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is almost identical to the real [[distance]] to the object, because spacetime within our galaxy is almost Euclidean. For much more distant objects the Euclidean approximation is not valid, and [[General Relativity]] must be taken into account when calculating the luminosity distance of an object.

In the Euclidean approximation for nearby objects, the absolute magnitude &lt;math&gt;M\!\,&lt;/math&gt; of a star can be calculated from its [[apparent magnitude]] and [[parallax]]:
:&lt;math&gt; M = m + 5 (\log_{10}{\pi} + 1)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where π is the star's parallax in seconds of an arc.

==== Example ====

: [[Rigel]] has a visual magnitude of m&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;=0.18 and distance about 773 light-years.
:: M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;Rigel&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.18 + 5*log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(32.616/773) = &amp;minus;6.7
: [[Vega]] has a parallax of 0.133&quot;, and an apparent magnitude of +0.03
:: M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;Vega&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.03 + 5*(1 + log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(0.133)) = +0.65
: [[Alpha Centauri]] has a [[parallax]] of 0.750&quot; and an apparent magnitude of -0.01
:: M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha; Cen&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;0.01 + 5*(1 + log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(0.750)) = +4.37

=== Apparent magnitude ===

Given the absolute magnitude &lt;math&gt;M\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, for objects within our galaxy you can also calculate the apparent magnitude &lt;math&gt;m\!\,&lt;/math&gt; from any distance &lt;math&gt;d\!\,&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; m = M + 5 (\log_{10}{d} - 1)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

For objects at very great distances (outside our galaxy) the [[luminosity distance]] ''D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' must be used instead of ''d''.

== Absolute Magnitude for planets ('''''H''''') ==

For [[planets]], [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s a different definition of absolute magnitude is used which is more meaningful for nonstellar objects.

In this case, the absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude that the object would have if it were one [[astronomical unit]] (au) from both the [[Sun]] and the [[Earth]] and at a [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]] of zero degrees. This is a physical impossibility, but it is convenient for purposes of calculation.

To convert a stellar or galactic absolute magnitude into a planetary one, subtract 31.57. This factor also corresponds to the difference between the Sun's [[visual magnitude]] of &amp;minus;26.8 and its (stellar) absolute magnitude of +4.8. Thus, the Milky Way (galactic absolute magnitude &amp;minus;20.5) would have a planetary absolute magnitude of &amp;minus;52.

=== Calculations ===

Formula for H: (Absolute Magnitude)
: &lt;math&gt; H = m_{Sun} - 5 \log_{10}\frac{ \sqrt { a } r}{d_0}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_{Sun}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the apparent magnitude of the Sun at 1 au (&amp;minus;26.73), &lt;math&gt;a\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the geometric [[albedo]] of the body (a number between 0 and 1), &lt;math&gt;r\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is its [[radius]] and &lt;math&gt;d_0\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is 1 au (&amp;#8776;149.6 Gm).

==== Example ====

Moon: &lt;math&gt;a_{Moon}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = 0.12, &lt;math&gt;r_{Moon}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = 3476/2 km = 1738 km
: &lt;math&gt; H_{Moon} = m_{Sun} - 5 \log_{10}\frac{ \sqrt { a_{Moon} } r_{Moon}}{d_0} = +0.25\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Apparent magnitude ===

The absolute magnitude can be used to help calculate the apparent magnitude of a body under different conditions.

:&lt;math&gt;m = H + 2.5 \log_{10}{(\frac{d_{BS}^2 d_{BO}^2}{p(\chi) d_0^4})}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;d_0\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is 1 au, &lt;math&gt;\chi\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], the angle between the Sun-Body and Body-Observer lines; by the [[law of cosines]], we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos{\chi} = \frac{ d_{BO}^2 + d_{BS}^2 - d_{OS}^2 } {2 d_{BO} d_{BS}}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p(\chi)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phase integral]] (integration of reflected light; a number in the 0 to 1 range)
:Example: (An [[Lambertian_diffuse_lighting_model|ideal diffuse reflecting]] [[sphere]]) - A reasonable first approximation for planetary bodies

&lt;math&gt;p(\chi) = \frac{2}{3} ( (1 - \frac{\chi}{\pi}) \cos{\chi} + (1/\pi) \sin{\chi} )\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
: A full-phase diffuse sphere reflects 2/3 as much light as a diffuse disc of the same diameter
: Distances:
:: &lt;math&gt;d_{BO}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the observer and the body
:: &lt;math&gt;d_{BS}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the Sun and the body
:: &lt;math&gt;d_{OS}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the observer and the Sun

==== Example ====

Moon
: &lt;math&gt;H_{Moon}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = +0.25
: &lt;math&gt;d_{OS}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_{BS}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = 1 au
: &lt;math&gt;d_{BO}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = 384.5 Mm = 2.57 mau

: How bright is the Moon from Earth?
:: Full Moon: &lt;math&gt;\chi\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = 0, (&lt;math&gt;p(\chi)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;#8776; 2/3)
::: &lt;math&gt;m_{Moon} = 0.25 + 2.5 \log_{10}{(\frac{3}{2} 0.00257^2)} = -12.26\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
::: (Actual -12.7) A full Moon reflects 30% more light at full phase than a perfect diffuse reflector predicts.
:: Quarter Moon: &lt;math&gt;\chi\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = 90°, &lt;math&gt;p(\chi) \approx \frac{2}{3\pi}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; (if diffuse reflector)
::: &lt;math&gt;m_{Moon} = 0.25 + 2.5 \log_{10}{(\frac{3\pi}{2} 0.00257^2)} = -11.02\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
::: (Actual approximately &amp;minus;11.0) The diffuse reflector formula does better for smaller phases.

'''Apollo One''' is the official name given retroactively to the '''Apollo/Saturn 204''' ('''AS-204''') spacecraft, destroyed by [[fire]] during a training exercise on [[January 27]] [[1967]], at Pad 34 (Launch Complex 34 at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]]) atop a [[Saturn IB]] rocket. Its crew were the astronauts selected for the initial [[Project Apollo|Apollo program]] mission and all three died in the accident: Command Pilot [[Gus Grissom|Virgil I. Grissom]], Senior Pilot [[Edward Higgins White|Ed White]], and Pilot [[Roger B. Chaffee]].

==The accident==
[[Image:Apollo 1 fire.jpg|thumb|left|The charred remains of Apollo 1]]
The Apollo 1 Command Module was a &quot;Block I&quot; design, built for spaceflight but never intended for a trip to the moon, as it lacked the necessary docking equipment.

Immediately prior to the accident, the crew members were reclining in their horizontal couches, running through a checklist of things they would do in space while a communication system problem was being fixed. Suddenly, a voice (now believed to be Chaffee's, as his was the only clear channel) was heard over the COM link, &quot;We've got fire in the cockpit.&quot; A few seconds later the transmissions ended with a cry of pain. On the television monitors, Ed White was seen to be attempting to open the hatch. However, the two-piece hatch was of a design which required that the crew undo several bolts in order to remove the inner section, and was impossible to open quickly. Furthermore, the inner portion of hatch opened inwards, an intentional design feature intended to exploit the cabin's air pressure in order to further tighten the hatch seal during spaceflight. The hot gasses produced by the fire held the hatch shut, and within a few seconds the air pressure had risen enough to prevent the crew from escaping (and in fact the air pressure rose so high as to rupture the capsule).

===Cause===
The fire is believed to have been caused by a spark somewhere in the capsule's 30 miles (50 km) of wiring. Due to the pure oxygen inside the capsule (which was at a pressure of 15 [[Pound-force per square inch|psi]] or 100 [[kilopascal|kPa]]) the fire was quickly out of control. The Apollo 204 Review Board determined that a [[silver]]-[[Plating|plated]] [[copper]] [[wire]] running through an environmental control unit near the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]] pilot's couch had become stripped of its insulation and abraded by repeated opening and closing of an associated access door. This weak point in the wiring also happened to pass near a junction in a [[ethylene glycol]] / water cooling line, which had developed a leak. The [[electrolysis]] of ethylene glycol solution with the [[anode]] made of silver resulted in a violent [[exothermic reaction]] that ignited the ethylene glycol mixture, which in turn was able to burn in the atmosphere of pure pressurized oxygen.[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/v4p2b.htm] A similar March [[1961]] incident had previously claimed the life of Soviet [[cosmonaut]] trainee [[Valentin Bondarenko]] when the pure oxygen atmosphere in the isolation chamber he had been occupying had caught fire, a calamity the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] had, for years, concealed from the public.

===The fire===
The fire spread quickly and within seconds was an inferno. The ground crew needed five minutes to open the hatch and suppress the flames. The fire had melted the astronauts' space suits and the air lines which connected them to the capsule's life support systems. Grissom's and White's suits were found to have fused together. It was evident from how the corpses lay that they had tried to get out, but they never had a chance. Ed White, who was supposed to open the hatch, was partway out of his harness and had apparently made an effort to escape. The procedure would have had Grissom lower White's headrest, and White proceed to unlatch over 12 bolts to release the hatch. Indeed, even if he were to accomplish that, the internal pressure had risen so high that the inward-opening hatch could not have been opened. Chaffee's job was to begin shutting down the spacecraft and maintain communications with ground control, and was found dead still strapped into his right hand seat. Only 17 seconds from the first call of &quot;Fire!&quot;, all three were dead.  

It was later confirmed that the crew had actually died of smoke inhalation rather than burns. According to the Report of the Apollo 204 Review Board — Appendix D Panel 11, (link provided below), Grissom suffered third degree burns on 36% of his body (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns covered 60% of his body) and his spacesuit was 70% destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on 40% of his body (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns covered 48% of his body) and his spacesuit was 25% destroyed.  Chaffee suffered third degree burns on 23% of his body (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns covered 29% of his body) and his spacesuit was 15% destroyed.

The company that produced the command module, [[North American Aviation]], had originally suggested that the hatch open outward and be able to open with [[explosive bolt]]s in case of emergency. They had also suggested that the atmosphere be an oxygen/nitrogen mixture, like on the earth's surface. [[NASA]] didn't agree, arguing that the hatch could be accidentally opened (this is what caused [[Liberty Bell 7]] — ironically, piloted by Grissom — to sink into the ocean during splashdown recovery operations; Grissom himself argued that the hatch should be stronger, more secure, and harder to open), and that if too much nitrogen were released into the atmosphere, the astronauts would pass out and then die.  They also argued that since a pure oxygen atmosphere was used safely in [[Mercury program|Mercury]] and [[Gemini program|Gemini]], it should be safe to use for Apollo.  Furthermore, such a design saved weight.  After the fire, Apollo was grounded pending a redesign, with the following results:

* The atmosphere would not be pressurized to 2 lbf/in&amp;sup2; (14 [[Pascal_(unit)|kPa]]) above [[atmospheric pressure]].  It would consist of 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen at sea-level pressure at launch, lowering to 5 kPA of pressure during launch, and gradually changing over to 100% oxygen during the first 24 hours of the trans-lunar coast.
* The hatch would open outward, and be operable in less than ten seconds.
* [[Flammable]] materials in the cabin were replaced with self-extinguishing materials.
* [[Plumbing]] and wiring were covered with protective [[thermal insulation|insulation]].
* 1,407 wiring problems were corrected.
* [[Nylon]] suits were replaced with coated glass fabric suits, much more difficult to ignite.

==The naming of Apollo 1==
When [[North American Aviation]] shipped Spacecraft CM-012 to [[Kennedy Space Center]], it bore a banner proclaiming it &quot;Apollo One&quot; and Grissom's crew had received approval for an &quot;Apollo 1&quot; patch in June [[1966]], but NASA was planning to call that mission &quot;AS-204.&quot;  After the fire, the astronauts' widows asked that &quot;Apollo 1&quot; be reserved for the flight their husbands would never make.  For a time, mission planners called the next scheduled launch &quot;Apollo 2.&quot;  Suggestions were made that the flights should be called &quot;Apollo 1&quot; (AS-204), &quot;Apollo 1A&quot; (AS-201), &quot;Apollo 2&quot; (AS-202), and &quot;Apollo 3&quot; (AS-203). Finally, the NASA Project Designation Committee approved &quot;[[Apollo 4]]&quot; for the first (unmanned) Apollo-Saturn V mission (AS-501), but declared that there would be no retroactive renaming of AS-201, -202, or -203.
The Apollo 1 (AS-204) Saturn IB rocket was taken down from Launch Complex 34 and later reassembled at Launch Complex 37B. It was used to launch the [[Apollo 5]] LM-1 into earth orbit for the first [[Lunar Module]] test mission.

==Memorial==

[[image:LaunchComplex34.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Launch Complex 34, showing plaque on right rear post]] 

While Launch Complex 34 has been essentially dismantled, the cement and steel-reinforced launch platform remains at the site. The platform bears two plaques for the 3 men who perished. One says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''LAUNCH COMPLEX 34''&lt;br /&gt;
''Friday, 27&amp;nbsp;January 1967''&lt;br /&gt;
''1831 Hours''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''Dedicated to the living memory of the crew of the Apollo 1'':&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''U.S.A.F. Lt. Colonel Virgil I. Grissom''&lt;br /&gt;
''U.S.A.F. Lt. Colonel Edward H. White, II''&lt;br /&gt;
''U.S.N. Lt. Commander Roger B. Chaffee''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''They gave their lives in service to their country in the ongoing exploration of humankind's final frontier. Remember them not for how they died but for those ideals for which they lived.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left&quot;/&gt;

[[image:Apollo_1_2nd_plaque.png|thumb|right|300px|Drawing of second Apollo 1 plaque that is attached to Launch Complex 34]] 
The other says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''IN MEMORY OF THOSE WHO MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE SO OTHERS COULD REACH FOR THE STARS''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''AD ASTRA PER ASPERA''&lt;br /&gt;
''(A ROUGH ROAD LEADS TO THE STARS)''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''GOD SPEED TO THE CREW OF APOLLO 1''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This plaque was featured in the film ''[[Armageddon (movie)|Armageddon]]''.

In addition to both, a college classmate of one of the astronauts fashioned three granite benches, one for each member of the crew.  The benches were installed in January 2005.

Each year the families of the Apollo 1 crew are invited to the site for a memorial, and the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Center offers a visit to the site for those who choose to take a special tour to the older launch sites that are on Cape Canaveral.

Three stars, [[Epsilon Cassiopeiae|Navi]], [[Dnoces]] and [[Regor]] were named in honor of the crew. The names are &quot;Ivan,&quot; &quot;Second&quot; and &quot;Roger&quot; spelled backwards. Ivan was Grissom's middle name and White was Edward H. White the Second. The crew used the stars to calibrate their equipment and, as a practical joke, recorded the names in official NASA documentation. The names eventually stuck as a posthumous honor.{{ref|star_names}}

==Conspiracy theories==
The space community, particularly [[USENET]] newsgroups sci.space.history and sci.space.policy, frequently see semi-anonymous postings which accuse NASA and/or other US authorities of [[arson]] and conspiracy to assassinate the crew of Apollo 1. It is claimed that NASA administrators held Grissom personally responsible for the loss of the [[Liberty Bell 7]] capsule at sea, and wanted to avenge this agency-wide loss of face. According to the Star tabloid, Grissom's son [[Scott Grissom]], a pilot himself, demanded a renewed investigation into the Apollo 1 disaster back in [[1999]]. Nonetheless, the accusations are generally regarded as [[Internet troll|trolling]] by the USENET community.

'''Apollo 10''' was the fourth manned mission in the [[Project Apollo|Apollo program]], and the first (and only manned Saturn V) mission to launch from pad 39B.  The mission included the second crew to orbit the Moon, and the test of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] in lunar orbit.  The module came to within 8.4 nautical miles (15.6 km) of the lunar surface during practice maneuvers. According to the 2001 Guinness World Records Apollo 10 has the record for the highest speed attained by a manned vehicle: 39,897 km/h (11.08 km/s or 24,791 mph).
The speed record was set during the return from the Moon on the [[26 May]], [[1969]].

*[[May 22]], [[1969]], 21:29:43 UTC

On [[May 22]] [[1969]] at 20:35:02 UTC, a 27.4 second LM descent propulsion system burn  inserted the LM into a descent orbit of 112.8 km by 15.7 km so that the resulting lowest point in the orbit occurred about 15° from lunar landing site 2 (the Apollo 11 landing site). The lowest measured point in the trajectory was 15.6 km &lt;!--see talk--&gt; above the lunar surface at 21:29:43 UTC.

==Mission Highlights==
This dress rehearsal for a Moon landing brought Stafford and Cernan's lunar module, nicknamed &quot;[[Snoopy]]&quot;, to 8.4 nautical miles (15.6 km) from the lunar surface. Except for that final stretch, the mission went exactly as a landing would have gone, both in space and on the ground, where Apollo's extensive tracking and control network was put through a dry run. Shortly after leaving low Earth orbit, the command/service module separated from the S-IVB stage, turned around, and docked its nose to the top of the lunar module still nestled in the S-IVB.  The CSM/LM stack then separated from the S-IVB for the trip to the moon. Upon reaching lunar orbit, Young remained alone in his command module &quot;[[Charlie Brown]],&quot; while Stafford and Cernan flew separately in the LM.  They checked out the LM's radar and ascent engine, rode out a momentary gyration in the lunar lander's motion (due to a faulty switch setting), and surveyed the Apollo 11 landing site in the Sea of Tranquillity. This test article of the lunar module was not equipped to land, however. Apollo 10 also added another first - broadcasting live color TV from space. 

On [[May 22]] [[1969]] Apollo 10's lunar module flew within 15.6 km of the [[Moon]]'s surface.  

:Launched:  [[May 18]], [[1969]] from Pad 39B
:Returned:  [[May 26]], [[1969]]
:Crew members:   [[Tom Stafford]], commander; [[John W. Young|John Young]], command module pilot; [[Gene Cernan]], lunar module pilot
:Command module:  [[Charlie Brown]]
:Lunar module:  [[Snoopy]]

The command module is displayed at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in [[London]]. The lunar module is in heliocentric orbit, thus making it the only intact lunar module ascent stage out of all of the lunar modules sent into space (Apollos [[Apollo 5|5]], [[Apollo 9|9]], [[Apollo 13|13]] LM ascent stages burned up in Earth's atmosphere, ''[[Apollo 11]]'' LM ascent stage left in lunar orbit - eventually crashed on moon, Apollos [[Apollo 12|12]], [[Apollo 14|14]], [[Apollo 15|15]], [[Apollo 16|16]], [[Apollo 17|17]] LM ascent stages deliberately crashed into moon) .

Shortly after liftoff from Cape Canaveral, the Saturn V rocket body was hit by a bolt of upper-atmosphere [[lightning]]. The CM's instruments momentarily went off-line and Mission Control lost the telemetry feeds from the spacecraft for several seconds.  When ground control regained telemetry lock with the spacecraft, the feeds were garbled and reported incomplete and possibly inaccurate information.  [[EECOM]] [[John Aaron]] thought that the garbled telemetry might be caused by a malfunction in the launch vehicle's Signal Condition Equipment, since the SCE controlled the spacecraft's electrical power measurements and would have automatically gone off-line in response to the kind of disruption to the spacecraft's electrical systems that a lightning strike would cause ([http://history.nasa.gov/SP-287/ch5.htm source]).

With this in mind, he suggested the crew &quot;Try SCE to aux,&quot; or switch to the auxiliary set of Signal Condition Equipment.  The command was a relatively obscure one and neither the [[Flight Director]], [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]], or mission CDR Conrad could immediately recall how to implement it; however, LMP Al Bean remembered that the SCE switch was on his panel because of a training incident a year prior to launch where just such a failure had been simulated.  John Aaron's quick thinking and Al Bean's memory were able to salvage what otherwise would have been an [[Apollo abort modes|aborted mission]] (at the time of the failure, the flight had just entered abort mode One Bravo).  With telemetry restored, the crew proceeded to parking orbit and was able to fully restore and verify the functionality of their spacecraft before re-igniting the [[S-IVB]] third stage for [[Trans Lunar Injection|trans-lunar injection]].

The S-IVB was originally intended to be put into a solar orbit by venting the remaining propellant. However an extra long burn of the ullage motors meant that venting the remaining propellant in the tank of the S-IVB did not give the rocket stage enough energy to escape the Earth-Moon system and instead the stage ended up in a semi-stable orbit around the Earth after passing by the Moon in [[November 18]], [[1969]]. It finally entered into solar orbit [[1971]], but returned to Earth orbit (briefly) 31 years later. It was discovered by amateur astronomer [[Bill Yeung]] and he gave it the temporary designation [[J002E3]] before it was determined to be an artificial, not natural, object.

The Apollo 12 mission landed on an area of the Ocean of Storms that had been visited earlier by several unmanned missions ([[Luna 5]], [[Surveyor 3]], and [[Ranger 7]]). The [[International Astronomical Union]], recognizing this, christened this region ''Mare Cognitium (Known Sea)''.  The landing site would thereafter be listed as ''[[Statio Cognitium]]'' on lunar maps (Conrad and Bean did not formally name their landing site, interestingly enough, though the intended touchdown point was nicknamed ''Pete's Parking Lot'' by Conrad).

The second lunar landing was an exercise in precision targeting. The descent was automatic, with only a few manual corrections by Conrad. Although ''[[Apollo 11]]'' had made an almost embarrassingly imprecise landing well outside the designated target area, Apollo 12 succeeded, on [[November 19]], in making a pin-point landing, within walking distance (less than 200 meters) of the [[Surveyor 3]] probe, which had landed on the Moon in April [[1967]].

Conrad actually landed ''Intrepid'' 580 feet short of ''Pete's Parking Lot'' because the planned landing point looked rougher than anticipated during the final approach to touchdown.  The planned landing point was a little under 1180 feet from ''Surveyor 3'', a distance that was chosen to eliminate the possibility of lunar dust (being kicked up by ''Intrepid's'' descent engine during landing) from covering ''Surveyor 3''.  But the actual touchdown point - 600 feet from ''Surveyor 3'' - did cause a thin film of dust to coat the probe, giving it a light tan hue.

To improve the quality of television pictures from the Moon, a color camera was carried on Apollo 12 (unlike the monochrome camera that was used on ''[[Apollo 11]]''). Unfortunately, when Bean carried the camera to the place near the lunar module where it was to be set up, he inadvertently pointed it directly into the Sun, destroying the [[vidicon tube]]. Television coverage of this mission was thus terminated almost immediately.

Conrad and Bean removed pieces of the [[Surveyor 3]], to be taken back to Earth for analysis, and took two Moon-walks lasting just under four hours each. They collected rocks and set up equipment that took measurements of the Moon's seismicity, solar wind flux and magnetic field, and relayed the measurements to Earth.  (By accident Bean left several rolls of exposed film on the lunar surface.)  Meanwhile Gordon, on board the ''Yankee Clipper'' in lunar orbit, took multispectral photographs of the surface.

The lunar plaque attached to the descent stage of ''Intrepid'' is unique in that unlike the other [[lunar plaques]], it (a) did not have a depiction of the Earth, and (b) it was textured differently (the other plaques had black lettering on polished stainless steel while the Apollo 12 plaque had the lettering in polished stainless steel while the background was brushed flat).

''Intrepid's'' ascent stage was dropped (per normal procedures) after Conrad and Bean rejoined Gordon in orbit. It impacted the Moon on [[20 November]], [[1969]] at 3.94 S, 21.20 W.  The seismometers the astronauts had left on the lunar surface registered the vibrations for more than an hour.  

The crew stayed an extra day in lunar orbit taking photographs, for a total lunar stay of thirty-one and a half hours.  

The command module and its crew were flawlessly recovered by the aircraft carrier [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|USS ''Hornet'']]. The ship is now open to the public as a museum in [[Alameda, CA]].  The command module is displayed at the [[Virginia Air and Space Center]], [[Hampton, Virginia]]

==Trivia==
*Pete Conrad smuggled a camera-shutter self-timer device on to the mission with the intent of taking a photograph with himself, Alan Bean and the Surveyor 3 probe in the frame. As the timer was not part of their standard equipment, such an image would have thrown post-mission photo analysts into confusion over how the photo was taken. Unfortunately the self-timer was mis-placed during the EVA and the plan was never executed.

*The Apollo 12 backup crew managed to 'insert' into the astronaut's lunar checklist (attached to the wrists of Conrad's and Bean's spacesuits) reduced sized pictures of [[Playboy]] centerfolds, thus introducing [[pornography]] to the moon for the first time when Conrad and Bean were looking through the lists during their first EVA.

*Another idea that did not materialize was that Conrad - who loved collecting baseball caps - had a giant one made that would fit over his space helmet.  He wanted to wear it during his lunar EVA's, but there was no way that it could be smuggled on board Apollo 12 without it being found out.

*The Apollo 12 mission patch has four stars on it—one each for the three astronauts who flew the mission and one for [[Clifton Williams]].  Williams was killed on [[October 5]], [[1967]], after a mechanical failure caused the controls of his T-38 trainer to stop responding. He had been assigned to the back-up crew for what would be the [[Apollo 9]] mission and would have most likely been assigned as Lunar Module pilot for Apollo 12.

*A part of one of the rock samples collected on Apollo 12, lunar sample 12013, has a composition which is remarkably similar to some [[tektite]]s. It is especially similar to high-magnesium javenites (part of the Australasian strewn field of Southeast Asia).

On the way down, the LM &quot;Antares&quot; had two problems.  First, the LM computer began getting an ABORT signal from the ABORT switch.  NASA believed that the computer might be getting erroneous readings like this if a tiny ball of soldering material had shaken loose and was floating between the switch and the contact, closing the circuit.  The immediate solution - tapping on the panel next to the switch - did work, but if the problem recurred after the descent engine fired, the computer would think the signal was real and would initiate the sequence to blow the Ascent Stage back into orbit.  NASA and the software teams at MIT scrambled to find a more permanent solution - reprogramming the computer to ignore the signal - and Shepard and Mitchell were able to accomplish this just in time.

The second problem was the failure of the radar to lock onto the moon's surface.  Eventually, at close to the last possible moment, it started working.  Shepard landed the LM closer to its intended mark than any of the other five moon landing missions.

After landing in the [[Fra Mauro formation]] - the destination for [[Apollo 13]] - Shepard and Mitchell took two moon­walks, adding new seismic studies to the by now familiar Apollo experiment package, and using a &quot;lunar rickshaw&quot; pull cart to carry their equipment. Roosa, meanwhile, took pictures from on board command module &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; in lunar orbit.

The second moonwalk, or EVA, was intended to reach the rim of the 1,000­ foot (300 m) wide Cone Crater.  However, the two astronauts were not able to find the rim amid the rolling terrain of the crater's slopes. Later analysis, using the pictures that they took, determined that they had come within 65 feet of the crater's rim.  

Shepard and Mitchell deployed and activated various scientific instruments and experiments and collected almost 100 pounds (45 kg) of lunar samples for return to earth. Other Apollo 14 achievements included: first use of Mobile Equipment Transporter (MET); largest payload placed in lunar orbit; longest distance traversed on the lunar surface; largest payload returned from the lunar surface; longest lunar surface stay time (33 hours); longest lunar surface EVA (9 hours and 17 minutes); first use of shortened lunar orbit rendezvous techniques; first use of color TV with new [[vidicon tube]] on lunar surface; and first extensive orbital science period conducted during CSM solo operations.

On the way back to Earth, the crew conducted the first U.S. materials processing experiments in space. The Apollo 14 astronauts were the last lunar explorers to be quarantined on their return from the Moon. 

Shepard and Mitchell named their landing site ''Fra Mauro Base'', and this designation is recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (depicted in Latin on lunar maps as ''Statio Fra Mauro'').

===Mission notes===

*Shepard is the only astronaut from [[Project Mercury]] (the original seven astronauts) to reach the Moon.
*Shepard smuggled a makeshift six iron [[golf]] club and two golf balls to the [[moon]], and took several swings. He exuberantly, and somewhat whimsically, exclaimed that the second ball went &quot;miles and miles and miles&quot; in the lunar [[gravity]], but later estimated it actually went 200 to 400 yards (200 to 400 m).  Mitchell then used a lunar scoop handle as a javelin, creating the first 'Lunar Olympics'.
*Mitchell conducted some unauthorized [[extra-sensory perception]] experiments while en route to the Moon, with friends back on Earth; the number of matches were reportedly less than would have been obtained by [[random]] chance.
*Shepherd's moonwalking suit was the first to incorporate red bands on the arms and legs, and a red stripe on the top of the lunar EVA sunshade &quot;hood,&quot; as to allow easy identification of the commander while on the surface; on the [[Apollo 12]] pictures, it had been almost impossible to distinguish between the two crewmen, causing a great deal of confusion. This feature was on [[Jim Lovell]]'s [[Apollo 13]] suit, but because of the accident, this was not used. It was used on the remaining three Apollo flights and is used on both the U.S. and Russian spacesuits on both the [[Space Shuttle]] and [[International Space Station]].
*Of the three crewmen, only Mitchell is the only member of the crew to remain alive (as of 1/06)--Roosa dying in 1994 from [[pancreatitis]] and Shepherd from [[leukemia]] in 1998.
*The mission was somewhat of a personal success for Shepard, who had battled back from [[Ménière’s disease]], earned his flight status back and made his first mission in space in ten years.

The mission's command module ''Kitty Hawk'' is displayed at the [[Astronaut Hall of Fame]], [[Titusville, Florida]] and the lunar module ''Antares'' impacted the Moon [[7 February]], [[1971]] at 3.42° S, 19.67° W.

===Quotes===
&quot;It's been a long way, but we're here.&quot;
Alan B. Shepard, Jr, his first words on the moon. Unlike Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Apollo 12's Pete Conrad, Shepard had already gotten off the ladder and was a few meters from the LM.

&quot;I think you're all finks.&quot; 
Edgar B. Mitchell. ''(said in response to Cmdr. Shepard's suggestion to turn back during their second EVA, where they came within 65 feet (21 m) of the rim of the 1,000­ foot (300 m) wide Cone Crater that they were looking for)''

'''''Apollo 15''''' was the ninth manned mission in the [[Project Apollo|Apollo program]] and the fourth mission to land on the [[Moon]]. It was the first of what were termed J missions &amp;mdash; long duration stays on the Moon with a greater focus on science than had been on previous missions.

Commander [[David Scott]] and Lunar Module Pilot [[James Irwin]] spent three days on the Moon and a total of 18½ hours outside the spacecraft on lunar [[extra-vehicular activity]]. The mission was the first not to land in a [[Lunar mare]], instead landing near [[Mons Hadley|Hadley rille]] in an area of the [[Mare Imbrium]] called ''Palus Putredinus'' (Marsh of Decay). The crew explored the area using the first [[Lunar Rover]] allowing them to travel much further from the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] lander than had previously been possible. They collected a total of 77 kg (170 lb) lunar surface material.

At the same time Command Module Pilot [[Alfred Worden]] orbited the Moon, using a Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) to study the lunar surface and environment in great detail using a panoramic camera, [[gamma ray spectrometer]], mapping camera, laser [[altimeter]], [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]], and lunar sub-satellite that was launched at the end of the mission.

==Mission Highlights==
===Incident===
Shortly after stage 1 separation, the instrumentation on stage 1 went dead. This was traced to the exhaust of stage 2 striking the stage and burning out the electronics. This had never happened before; and was traced to a reduction in the number of retrofire charges from 8 to 4. It was discovered that the two stages were in fact uncomfortably close, due to the slow thrust decay of the F-1 engines, and failure of any one charge could have caused a collision. Later flights had the original retrofire configuration.

===Planning and training===
The crew for ''Apollo 15'' had previously served as the backup crew for ''Apollo 12''. There had been a friendly rivalry between that prime and backup crew on that mission, with the prime being all [[United States Navy|Navy]], and the backup all [[United States Air Force|Air Force]].

Originally ''Apollo 15'' would have been an H mission, like Apollos ''[[Apollo 12|12]]'', ''[[Apollo 13|13]]'', ''[[Apollo 14|14]]''. But on [[September 2]], [[1970]], [[NASA]] announced it was cancelling what were to be the current incarnations of the ''Apollo 15'' and ''[[Cancelled Apollo missions|Apollo 19]]'' missions. To maximize the return from the remaining mission, ''Apollo 15'' would now fly as a J mission and have the honor of carrying the first Lunar Rover.

One of the major changes in the training for ''15'' was the geology training. Although on previous flights the crews had been trained in field geology, for the first time ''15'' would make it a high priority. Scott and Irwin would train with [[Lee Silver]], a Caltech geologist who on Earth was interested in the [[Precambrian]]. Silver had been suggested by [[Harrison Schmitt]] as an alternative to the classroom lecturers that NASA had previously used. Among other things, Silver had made important refinements to the methods for dating rocks using the decay of [[uranium]] into [[lead]] in the late 1950s.

At first Silver would take the prime and backup crews to various geological sites as if it was just a normal field geology lesson, but as the time of launch began to approach, these trips became more and more realistic. The crews would begin to wear mock-ups of the backpacks they would carry and communicate using [[walkie-talkie]]s to a CapCom in a tent (during a mission the Capsule Communicators, CapComs, were the only people who would normally speak to the crew). With the CapCom would be a group of geologists who did not know the area and would have to rely on the astronauts descriptions to interpret the area.

The decision to land at Hadley came in September 1970. The Site Selection Committees had narrowed the field down to two sites &amp;mdash; Hadley Rille or the crater [[Marius (crater)|Marius]], near which were a group of low, possibly volcanic, domes. Although not ultimately his decision, the commander of a mission always held great sway. To Dave Scott the choice was clear, with Hadley, being &quot;exploration at its finest&quot;.

Command Module Pilot Al Worden also undertook geology training, but of a different kind. Working with an [[Egypt]]ian, [[Farouk El-Baz]], he would fly over areas in an [[airplane]] simulating the speed at which terrain would pass below him while in the CSM in orbit. He became quite adept at making observations as the object traveled below.

The Lunar Roving Vehicle, or the Rover, had been in development since May 1969, with the contract awarded to [[Boeing]] (who also were the lead contractors for the [[S-II]] second stage of the [[Saturn V]]). It could be folded into a space 5 ft by 20 in (1.5 m by 0.5 m). Unloaded it weighed 460 lb (209 kg) and when carrying two astronauts and their equipment, 1500 lb (700 kg). Each wheel was independently driven by 1/4 [[horsepower]] (200 W) electric motor. Although it could be driven by either astronaut, the Commander always drove. Travelling at speeds up to 6 to 8 mph (10 to 12 km/h), it meant that for the first time the astronauts could travel far afield from their lander and still have enough time to do some serious science.

The Saturn V that launched ''Apollo 15'' was designated SA-510, the tenth flight-ready model of the rocket. ''Apollo 15'' used [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] CSM-112, which was given the callsign ''Endeavour'', named after the [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']]  and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] LM-10, callsign ''Falcon'', named after the [[United States Air Force Academy]] [[mascot]]. If ''Apollo 15'' had flown as an H mission it would with CSM-111 and LM-9. The CSM was used by the [[Apollo Soyuz Test Project]] and the Lunar Module was unused and is now on display at the [[Kennedy Space Center]].

As the payload of the rocket was greater, changes were made to its launch trajectory and Saturn V itself. The rocket was launched in a more southerly direction (80&amp;ndash;100 degrees [[azimuth]]) and the Earth parking orbit lowered to 166 km (90 nautical miles) above the Earth's surface. These two changes meant 1100 pounds (500 kg) more could be launched. The [[propellant]] reserves were reduced and the number of retrorockets on the [[S-IC]] first stage reduced from eight to four. The four outboard engines of the S-IC would be burned longer and the center engine would also burn longer before being shutdown (see [[Saturn V]] for more information on the launch sequence). Changes were made to the [[S-II]] second stage to stop [[pogo oscillation]]s.

On the Lunar Module, the [[fuel]] and [[oxidizer]] tanks were enlarged on both the descent and ascent stages and the [[engine bell]] on the descent stage was extended. Batteries and [[solar cell]]s were added for increased electrical power. In all this increased the weight of the Lunar Module to 36,000 pounds (16,330 kilograms), 4000 pounds (1800 kg) heavier than previous models.

The astronauts themselves wore new spacesuits.  On all previous Apollo flights, including the non-lunar flights, the commander and lunar module pilot had worn suits with the life support, liquid cooling, and communications connections in two parallel rows of threes.  On Apollo 15, the new suits, dubbed the &quot;A7L-B,&quot; have the connectors situated in triangular pairs.  This new arrangement, along with the relocation of the entry zipper (which went in an up-down motion on the old suits), from the right shoulder to the left hip, allowed the inclusion of a new waist joint, allowing the astronauts to bend completely over, and even to sit on the rover.  Upgraded backpacks allowed for longer-duration moonwalks, and the command module pilot, who wore a suit with three connectors, would wear a five-connector version of the old moon suit--the liquid cooling water connector being removed, as the command module pilot would make a &quot;deep-space EVA&quot; to retrieve film cartridges on the flight home.

Technicians at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] had many problems with the SIM bay. It was the first time it had flown and experienced problems from the start. Problems came from the fact the instruments were designed to operate in zero gravity, but had to be tested in the 1 [[gee]] on the surface of the Earth. As such things like the 7.5 m booms for the [[Mass spectrometry|mass]] and [[gamma-ray spectrometer]]s could only be tested using railings that tried to mimic the space environment, though never worked particularly well. When the technicians tried to integrate the entire bay into the rest of the spacecraft, [[data stream]]s would not synchronize and lead investigators of the instruments would want to make last minute checks and changes. When it came time to test the operation of the gamma-ray spectrometer it was necessary to stop every engine within 10 miles (16 km) of the test site.
