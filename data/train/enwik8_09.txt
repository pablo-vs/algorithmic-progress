'''Alan Alexander Milne''' ([[January 18]], [[1882]] &amp;ndash; [[January 31]], [[1956]]), also known as '''A. A. Milne''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[author]], best known for his [[book]]s about the animated [[teddy bear]], [[Winnie the Pooh|Winnie-the-Pooh]], and for various children's poems. Milne had made several reputations, most notably as a playwright, before the huge success of Pooh overshadowed all his previous work.

==Biography==

Milne was born in [[Scotland]] but raised in [[London]] at a small private school in Kilburn run by his father John Vine Milne. One of his teachers was [[H. G. Wells]]. He attended [[Westminster School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he studied on a [[mathematics]] [[scholarship]]. While there, he edited and wrote for ''[[Granta]]'', a student magazine. He collaborated with his brother Kenneth and their articles appeared over the initials AKM. Milne's work came to the attention of the leading British humour magazine Punch, where Milne was to become a contributor and later assistant editor of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. 

His son [[Christopher Robin Milne|Christopher Robin]] was born in [[1920]]. Milne joined the [[British Army]] in [[World War I]] but after the war wrote a denunciation of war titled ''[[Peace with Honour]]'' ([[1934]]) (which he retracted somewhat in [[1940]] with ''[[War with Honour]]''). 

During the war, Milne was one of the most prominent critics of English comic writer [[P.G. Wodehouse]], who was captured at his country home in [[France]] by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and imprisoned for a year. Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment, which were broadcast from Berlin. Although the lighthearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans, Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near [[treason]] by cooperating with his country's enemy. Wodehouse got some revenge by creating fatuous parodies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories. 

In [[1925]], Milne bought a country home, [[Cotchford Farm]], in [[Hartfield]], [[East Sussex]]. He retired to the farm after brain surgery in [[1952]] left him an invalid.

== Literary career ==

Milne is most famous for his Pooh books about a boy named [[Christopher Robin]], after his son, and various characters inspired by his son's stuffed animals, most notably the bear named [[Winnie the Pooh|Winnie-the-Pooh]]. (Reputedly, a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[American Black Bear|black bear]] named Winnie (after [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]]), used as a military mascot by the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, a Canadian Infantry Regiment in World War I and left to [[London Zoo]] after the war, is the source of the name.) [[E. H. Shepard]] illustrated the original Pooh books, using his own teddy, Growler (&quot;a magnificent bear&quot;) as the model; Christopher Robin's own toys are now under glass in New York.

The overwhelming success of his children's books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to Milne, whose self-avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased, and who until then had found a ready audience for each change of direction: he had freed pre-war Punch from its ponderous facetiousness; he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright (like his idol [[JM Barrie]]) on both sides of the Atlantic; he had produced a durable, character-led and witty piece of detective writing in ''The Red House Mystery'' -- indeed, his publisher was displeased when he announced his intention to write poems for children -- and he had never lacked an audience. 

But once Milne had, in his own words, &quot;said Goodbye to all that in 70,000 words&quot;, the approximate length of the four children's books, he had no intention of producing a copy of a copy, given that one of the sources of inspiration, his son, was growing older.

His reception remained warmer in America than Britain, and he continued to publish novels and short stories, but by the late 1930s the audience for Milne's grown-up writing had largely vanished: he observed bitterly in his autobiography that a critic had said that the hero of his latest play (&quot;God help it&quot;) was simply &quot;Christopher Robin grown up ... what an obsession with me children are become!&quot;  

Even his old home, ''Punch'', where the ''When We Were Very Young'' verses had first appeared, was ultimately to reject him, as Christopher Milne details in his autobiography ''The Enchanted Places'', though Methuen continued to publish whatever Milne wrote, including the long poem 'The Norman Church' and an assembly of articles entitled ''Year In, Year Out'' (which Milne likened to a benefit night for the author). 

After Milne's death, the rights to the Pooh characters were sold by his widow, Daphne to [[the Walt Disney Company]], which has made a number of Pooh cartoon movies, as well as a large amount of Pooh-related merchandise. She also destroyed his papers.

Milne also wrote a number of poems, including ''Vespers'', ''They're Changing Guard at [[Buckingham Palace]]'', and ''King John's Christmas'', which were published in the books ''[[When We Were Very Young]]'' and ''[[Now We Are Six]]''.
His poems have been parodied many times, including the books When We Were Rather Older and  ''[[Now We Are Sixty]]''.

He also adapted [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' for the stage as ''[[Toad of Toad Hall]]''. The title was an implicit admission that such chapters as ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'' could not survive translation to the theater.

== Biographies ==

Milne's friend Frank Swinnerton's book ''The Georgian Literary Scene'' contains a substantial section about him; his son has written several books of autobiography: ''The Enchanted Places'', in particular, is an account of his attempt to escape from the shadow of a famous father and a burdensome name; ''The Path Through the Trees'' continues the story into adult life. Ann Thwaites' ''AA Milne: His Life'' is an excellent and detailed biography, although it gives little space to the plays; a spin-off book tells the story for a younger readership, concentrating on Pooh.

'''Addiction''' is a [[compulsion]] to repeat a behaviour regardless of its consequences. A person who is addicted is sometimes called an '''addict'''. 

There is a lack of consensus as to what may properly be termed 'addiction.' Some within the medical community maintain a rigid definition of addiction and contend that the term is only applicable to a process of escalating drug or alcohol use as a result of repeated exposure. However, addiction is often applied to compulsive [[behavior]]s other than drug use, such as overeating or gambling. In all cases, the term addiction describes a chronic pattern of behaviour that continues despite the direct or indirect adverse consequences that result from engaging in the behavior. It is quite common for an addict to express the desire to stop the behaviour, but find himself or herself unable to cease. 

Addiction is often characterized by a craving for more of the drug or behavior, increased [[physiological tolerance]] to exposure, and [[withdrawal]] symptoms in the absence of the stimulus. Many drugs and behaviours that provide either pleasure or relief from pain pose a risk of addiction or [[chemical dependency|dependency]].

==Terminology and usage==
The medical community now makes a careful theoretical distinction between ''physical dependence'' (characterized by symptoms of [[withdrawal]]) and ''psychological addiction'' (or simply ''addiction''). Addiction is now narrowly defined as &quot;uncontrolled, compulsive use despite harm&quot;; if there is no harm being suffered by, or damage done to, the patient or another party, then clinically it may be considered compulsive, but within this narrow definition it is not categorized as &quot;addiction&quot;. In practice, however, the two kinds of addiction are not always easy to distinguish. Addictions often have both physical and psychological components.

There is also a lesser known situation called [[pseudo-addiction]], where a patient will exhibit drug-seeking behaviour reminiscent of psychological addiction, however in this case, the patients tend to have genuine pain or other symptoms that have been undertreated.  Unlike true psychological addiction, however, these behaviours tend to stop as soon as their pain is adequately treated. 
The term &quot;''[[dry drunk]]''&quot; is sometimes attached to patterns of behavior that persist after an object of dependence and/or misuse
has been removed from daily living routines.  This type of behaviour is fairly common in early recovery for those recovering from substance misuse.   

The obsolete term ''physical addiction'' is deprecated, because of its connotations. In modern pain management with opioids: physical dependence is nearly universal but addiction is rare. Some of the highly addictive drugs (''[[hard drug]]s''), such as [[cocaine]], induce relatively little physical dependence.

Not all doctors do agree on what addiction or dependency is*, particularly because traditionally, addiction has been defined as being possible only to a psychoactive substance (for example [[alcoholism|alcohol]],  [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco]], or [[drug addiction|drugs]]), which is ingested, crosses the [[blood-brain barrier]], and alters the natural chemical behaviour of the brain temporarily. Many people, both psychology professionals and laypersons, now feel that there should be accommodation made to include psychological dependency on such things as [[gambling]], [[overeating|food]], [[hypersexuality|sex]], [[pornography addiction|pornography]], [[computer addiction|computers]], [[workaholic|work]], and [[shopping]] / spending. However, these are things or tasks which, when used or performed, cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and hence, do not fit into the traditional view of addiction. Symptoms mimicking withdrawal may occur with abatement of such behaviours; however, it is said by those who adhere to a traditionalist view that these withdrawal-like symptoms are not strictly reflective of an addiction, but rather of a behavioural disorder. In spite of traditionalist protests and warnings that overextension of definitions may cause the wrong treatment to be used (thus failing the person with the behavioural problem), popular media, and some members of the field, do represent the aforementioned behavioural examples as addictions.
*note: the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM IVR) specifically spells out criteria to define abuse and dependence conditions.

==Varied forms of addiction==
===Physical dependency===
''Physical dependency'' on a substance is defined by the appearance of characteristic [[withdrawal]] symptoms when the drug is suddenly discontinued. While opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, alcohol and nicotine are all well known for their ability to induce physical dependence, other drugs share this property that are not considered addictive: cortisone, [[beta-blockers]] and most antidepressants are examples. So while physical dependency can be a major factor in the psychology of addiction, the primary attribute of an addictive drug is its ability to induce euphoria while causing harm.  

Some drugs induce [[withdrawal|physical dependence]] or [[physiological tolerance]] - but not addiction - for example many [[laxative]]s, which are not psychoactive; nasal [[decongestants]], which can cause rebound congestion if used for more than a few days in a row; and some [[antidepressants]], most notably [[Effexor]] and [[Paxil]], as they have quite short [[half-lives]], so stopping them abruptly causes a more rapid change in the neurotransmitter balance in the brain than many other antidepressants.  Many non-addictive prescription drugs should not be suddenly stopped, so a doctor should be consulted before abruptly discontinuing them.

The speed with which a given individual becomes addicted to various substances varies with the substance, the frequency of use, the means of ingestion, and the individual. Some [[alcoholic]]s report they exhibited alcoholic tendencies from the moment of first intoxication, while most people can drink socially without ever becoming addicted. Because of this variation, some people hypothesise that physical dependency and addiction are in large part genetically moderated. [[Nicotine]] is one of the most addictive [[psychoactive]] substances: although 35 million smokers make an attempt to quit every year, less than 7% achieve even one year of abstinence.* 

While [[eating disorders]], like other behavioral addictions, are usually considered primarily psychological disorders, they are sometimes treated as addictions, especially if they include elements of addictive behavior. Sufferers may experience withdrawal or withdrawal-like symptoms if they alter their diet suddenly. This suggests that some common food substances, especially [[chocolate]], [[sugar]], [[salt]] and white flour may have the potential for addiction. In addition, frequent [[Wiktionary:overeat|overeat]]ing can also be considered an addiction.

* From the NIDA research report on nicotine addiction.

===Psychological addiction===
''[[Psychological addictions]]'' are a dependency of the mind, and lead to psychological withdrawal symptoms. Addictions can theoretically form for any rewarding behavior, or as a habitual means to avoid undesired activity, but typically they only do so to a clinical level in individuals who have emotional, social, or [[Mental illness|psychological dysfunctions]], taking the place of normal positive stimuli not otherwise attained (see [[Rat Park]]).

== Addiction and drug control legislation == 

Most countries have legislation which brings various drugs and drug-like [[substance]]s under the control of licensing systems. Typically this legislation covers any or all of the opiates, cannabinoids, cocaine, barbiturates, hallucinogens and a variety of more modern synthetic drugs, and unlicensed production, supply or possession is a criminal offence. 

Usually, however, drug classification under such legislation is not related simply to addictiveness. The substances covered often have very different addictive properties. Some are highly prone to cause physical dependency, whilst others rarely cause any form of compulsive need whatsoever.

Also, although the legislation may be justifiable on moral or public health grounds, it can make addiction or dependency a much more serious issue for the individual: reliable supplies of a drug become difficult to secure, and the individual becomes vulnerable to both criminal abuse and legal punishment.

==Methods of care== 

Early editions of the [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's]] ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) described addiction as a physical dependency to a substance that resulted in withdrawal symptoms in its absence. Recent editions, including DSM-IV, have moved toward a diagnostic instrument that classifies such conditions as dependency, rather than addiction. The [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] recommends treatment for people with chemical dependency based on [[patient placement criteria]] (currently listed in PPC-2), which attempt to match levels of care according to clinical assessments in six areas, including:
* Acute intoxication and/or withdrawal potential 
* Biomedical conditions or complications 
* Emotional/behavioral conditions or complications 
* Treatment acceptance/resistance 
* [[Relapse]] potential 
* Recovery environment 

Some medical systems, including those of at least 15 states of the United States, refer to an [[Addiction Severity Index]] to assess the severity of problems related to substance use. The index assesses problems in six areas: medical, employment/support, alcohol and other drug use, legal, family/social, and psychiatric.

While addiction or dependency is related to seemingly uncontrollable urges, and may have roots in genetic predisposition, treatment of dependency is always classified as behavioral medicine. Early treatment of acute withdrawal often includes medical detoxification, which can include doses of [[anxiolytic]]s to reduce symptoms of withdrawal. In chronic opiate addiction, a surrogate drug such as [[methadone]] is sometimes offered as a form of [[opiate replacement therapy]]. But treatment approaches universally focus on the individual's ultimate choice to pursue an alternate course of action. 

Therapists often classify patients with chemical dependencies as either interested or not interested in changing. Treatments usually involve planning for specific ways to avoid the addictive stimulus, and therapeutic interventions intended to help a client learn healthier ways to find satisfaction. Clinical leaders in recent years have attempted to tailor intervention approaches to specific influences that effect addictive behavior, using therapeutic interviews in an effort to discover factors that led a person to embrace unhealthy, addictive sources of pleasure or relief from pain.

==Diverse explanations==
Several explanations (or &quot;models&quot;) have been presented to explain addiction:

*The ''[[moral]] model'' states that addictions are the result of human weakness, and are defects of [[moral character|character]]. Those who advance this model do not accept that there is any biological basis for addiction. They often have scant sympathy for people with serious addictions, believing either that a person with greater moral strength could have the force of will to break an addiction, or that the addict demonstrated a great moral failure in the first place by starting the addiction. The moral model is widely applied to dependency on illegal substances, perhaps purely for social or political reasons, but is no longer widely considered to have any therapeutic value. Elements of the moral model, especially a focus on individual choices, have found enduring roles in other approaches to the treatment of dependencies.  

*The ''[[opponent-process]] model'' generated by Richard Soloman states that for every psychological event A will be followed by its opposite psychological event B.  For example, the pleasure one experiences from heroin is followed by an opponent process of withdrawal, or the terror of jumping out of an airplane is rewarded with intense pleasure when the parachute opens. This model is related to the opponent process color theory.  If you look at the color red then quickly look at a gray area you will see green.  There are many examples of opponent processes in the nervous system including taste, motor movement, touch, vision, and hearing. Opponent-processes occurring at the sensory level may translate &quot;down-stream&quot; into addictive or habit-forming behavior. 

*The ''[[disease]] model'' holds that addiction is an illness, and comes about as a result of the impairment of healthy [[neurochemistry|neurochemical]] or behavioral processes. While there is some dispute among clinicians as to the reliability of this model, it is widely employed in therapeutic settings. Most treatment approaches involve recognition that dependencies are behavioral dysfunctions, and thus involve some element of physical or mental disease.

*The ''[[genetics|genetic]] model'' posits a genetic predisposition to certain behaviors. It is frequently noted that certain addictions &quot;run in the family,&quot; and while researchers continue to explore the extent of genetic influence, there is strong evidence that genetic predisposition is often a factor in dependency. Researchers have had difficulty assessing differences, however, between social causes of dependency learned in family settings and genetic factors related to [[heredity]].

*The ''[[culture|cultural]] model'' recognizes that the influence of culture is a strong determinant of whether or not individuals fall prey to certain addictions. For example, alcoholism is rare among [[Saudi Arabia]]ns, where obtaining alcohol is difficult and using alcohol is prohibited. In North America, on the other hand, the incidence of [[gambling]] addictions soared in the last two decades of the [[20th century]], mirroring the growth of the gaming industry. Half of all patients diagnosed as alcoholic are born into families where alcohol is used heavily, suggesting that familiar influence, genetic factors, or more likely both, play a role in the development of addiction.

*The ''blended model'' attempts to consider elements of all other models in developing a therapeutic approach to dependency. It holds that the mechanism of dependency is different for different individuals, and that each case must be considered on its own merits.

*The ''[[habit]] model'' proposed by [[Thomas Szasz]] questions the very concept of &quot;addiction.&quot; He argues that addiction is a metaphor, and that the only reason to make the distinction between habit and addiction &quot;is to persecute somebody.&quot; [http://www.szasz.com/drugsandfreedom1973.html (Szasz, 1973)]

The development of addiction is thought to involve a simultaneous process of 1) increased focus on and engagement in a particular behavior and 2) the attenuation or &quot;shutting down&quot; of other behaviors. For example, animals allowed the unlimited ability to self-administer psychoactive drugs will show such a strong preference that they will forgo food, sleep, and sex for continued access. The neuro-anatomical correlate of this that the brain regions involved in driving goal-directed behavior grow increasingly selective for particular motivating stimuli and rewards, to the point that the brain regions involved in the inhibition of behavior can no longer effectively send &quot;stop&quot; signals. A good analogy is to imagine flooring the gas pedal in a car with very bad brakes. In this case, the limbic system is thought to be the major &quot;driving force&quot; and the orbitofrontal cortex is the substrate of the top-down inhibition. 

A specific portion of the limbic circuit known as the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is hypothesized to play an important role in translation of motivation to motor behavior- and reward-related learning in particular.  It is typically defined as the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA), the nucleus accumbens, and the bundle of dopamine-containing fibres that connecting them. This system is commonly implicated in the seeking out and consumption of rewarding stimuli or events, such as sweet-tasting foods or sexual interaction. However, ita importance to addiction research goes beyond its role in &quot;natural&quot; motivation:  while the specific site or mechanism of action may differ, all known drugs of abuse have the common effect in that they elevate the level of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. This may happen directly, such as through blockade of the dopamine re-uptake mechanism (see [[cocaine]]). It may also happen indirectly, such as through stimulation of the dopamine-containing neurons of the VTA that synapse onto neurons in the accumbens (see [[opiates]]). The euphoric effects of drugs of abuse are thought to be a direct result of the acute increase in accumbal dopamine.   

The human body has a natural tendency to maintain [[homeostasis]], and the central nervous system is no exception. Chronic elevation of dopamine will result in a decrease in the number of dopamine [[Transmembrane receptor|receptors]] available in a process known as [[downregulation]]. The decreased number of receptors changes the permeability of the cell membrane located post-synaptically, such that the post-synaptic neuron is less excitable- ie, less able to respond to chemical signalling with an electrical impulse, or [[action potential]]. It is hypothesized that this dulling of the responsiveness of the brain's reward pathways contributes to the inability to feel pleasure, known as [[anhedonia]], often observed in addicts. The increased requirement for dopamine to maintain the same electrical activity is the basis of both [[physiological tolerance]] and [[withdrawal]] associated with addiction.

Downregulation can be classically conditioned. If a behavior consistently occurs in the same environment or contigently with a particular cue, the brain will adjust to the presence of the conditioned cues by decreasing the number of available receptors in the absence of the behavior. It is thought that many drug overdoses are not the result of a user taking a higher dose than is typical, but rather that the user is administering the same dose in a new environment.  

In cases of physical dependency on [[depressant]]s of the [[central nervous system]] such as opioids, [[barbiturate]]s, or alcohol, the absence of the substance can lead to symptoms of severe physical discomfort. Withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines (valium-family) can result in seizures and even death. By contrast, withdrawal from opioids, which can be extremely uncomfortable, is rarely if ever life-threatening. In cases of dependence and withdrawal, the body has become so dependent on high concentrations of the particular chemical that it has stopped producing its own natural versions (endogenous ligands) and instead produces opposing chemicals. When the addictive substance is withdrawn, the effects of the opposing chemicals can become overwhelming. For example, chronic use of sedatives (alcohol, [[barbiturate]]s, or benzodiazepines) results in higher chronic levels of stimulating [[neurotransmitter]]s such as glutamate. Very high levels of glutamate kill nerve cells (called excitatory neurotoxicity).

==Criticism==
[[Levi Bryant]] has criticized the term and concept of ''addiction'' as counterproductive in psychotherapy as it defines a patient's identity and makes it harder to become a ''non-addict''.  &quot;The signifier 'addict' doesn't simply describe what I am, but initiates a way of relating to myself that informs how I relate to others.&quot;

A stronger form or criticism comes from [[Thomas Szasz]], who denies that addiction is a psychiatric problem.  In many of his works, he argues that addiction is a choice, and that a drug addict is one who simply prefers a socially taboo substance rather than, say, a low risk lifestyle.  In 'Our Right to Drugs', Szasz cites the biography of [[Malcolm X]] to corroborate his economic views towards addiction: Malcolm claimed that quitting cigarettes was harder than shaking his heroine addiction.  Szasz postulates that humans always have a choice, and it is foolish to call someone an 'addict' just becuase they prefer a [[drug]] induced [[euphoria]] to a more popular and socially welcome lifestyle.

A similar conclusion to that of Thomas Szasz may also be reached through very different [[reasoning]].  This is the somewhat extreme, yet tenanable, view that humans do not have [[free will]]. From this perspective, being 'addicted' to a substance is no different than being 'addicted' to a job that you work everyday.  Without the assumption of free will, every human action is the result of the naturally occuring reactions of particle matter in the physical brain, and so there is no longer room for the concept of 'addiction', since, in this view, choice is an illusion of the [[human]] experience.

==Casual addiction==
The word addiction is also sometimes used colloquially to refer to something a person has a passion for. Such &quot;addicts&quot; include:

*[[Bibliophilia|Biblioholics]]
*[[Chocoholic]]s
*[[Workaholic]]s

In [[epistemology]], an '''axiom''' is a [[self-evidence|self-evident]] truth upon which other knowledge must rest, from which other knowledge is built up.  Not all [[epistemologist]]s agree that any axioms, understood in that sense, exist. 

In [[mathematics]], an '''axiom''' is ''not'' necessarily a ''self-evident'' truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in a deduction to yield further results. Mathematics distinguishes two types of axioms: [[#Logical axioms|logical axioms]] and [[#Non-logical axioms|non-logical axioms]].

==Etymology==

The word ''axiom'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word
&amp;alpha;&amp;xi;&amp;iota;&amp;omega;&amp;mu;&amp;alpha; (''axioma''), which means that which is deemed worthy or fit or that which is considered [[self-evidence|self-evident]].  The word comes from &amp;alpha;&amp;xi;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;nu; (''axioein''), meaning to deem worthy, which in turn comes from &amp;alpha;&amp;xi;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (''axios''), meaning worthy. Among the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]]s an axiom was a claim which could be seen to be true without any need for proof.

==Mathematics==

In the field of [[mathematical logic]], a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms: '''logical axioms''' and '''non-logical axioms'''. 

===Logical axioms===

These are certain [[Mathematical logic#Definition:Formula|formulas]] in a [[Mathematical logic#Definition:FirstOrderLanguage|language]] that are [[Mathematical logic#Definition:ValidFormula|universally valid]], that is, formulas that are [[Mathematical logic#Definition:Satisfaction|satisfied]] by every [[Mathematical logic#Definition:Structure|structure]] under every [[Mathematical logic#Definition:VariableAssignmentFunction|variable assignment function]] . In colloquial terms, these are statements that are ''true'' in any possible universe, under any possible interpretation and with any assignment of values.  Usually one takes as logical axioms some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all [[tautology|tautologies]] in the language.

====Examples====

In the [[propositional calculus]] it is common to take as logical axioms all formulas of the following forms, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; can be any formulas of the language:

#&lt;math&gt;\phi \to (\psi \to \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\phi \to (\psi \to \chi)) \to ((\phi \to \psi) \to (\phi \to \chi))&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\lnot \phi \to \lnot \psi) \to (\psi \to \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Each of these patterns is an ''[[axiom schema]]'', a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are propositional variables, then &lt;math&gt;A \to (B \to A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A \to \lnot B) \to (C \to (A \to \lnot B))&lt;/math&gt; are both instances of axiom schema 1, and hence are axioms.  It can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and ''[[modus ponens]]'', one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus.  It can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with ''modus ponens''.

These axiom schemata are also used in the [[predicate calculus]], but additional logical axioms are needed.

&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: 3px double #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Example.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt; be a first-order language. For each variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x = x&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

This means that, for any [[Mathematical logic#Definition:FirstOrderLanguage|variable symbol]] &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula &lt;math&gt;x = x\,&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as an axiom. Also, in this example, for this not to fall into vagueness and a never-ending series of &quot;primitive notions&quot;, either a precise notion of what we mean by &lt;math&gt;x = x\,&lt;/math&gt; (or, for all what matters, &quot;to be equal&quot;) has to be well established first, or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol &lt;math&gt;=\,&lt;/math&gt; has to be enforced, and [[mathematical logic]] does indeed do that.

Another, more interesting example, is that which provides us with what is known as '''universal instantiation''':

&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: 3px double #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Example.''' Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;, a variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and a [[Mathematical logic#Definition:Term|term]] &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt; that is [[Mathematical logic#Definition:VariableSubstitutionInFormula|substitutable]] for &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\forall x. \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

In informal terms, this example allows us to state that, if we know that a certain property &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; holds for every &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and that if &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt; stands for a particular object in our structure, then we should be able to claim &lt;math&gt;P(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;. Again, ''we are claiming that the formula'' &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt; ''is valid'', that is, we must be able to give a &quot;proof&quot; of this fact, or more properly speaking, a ''metaproof''. Actually, these examples are ''metatheorems'' of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of ''proof'' itself. Aside from this, we can also have '''existential generalization''':

&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: 3px double #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Axiom scheme.''' Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;, a variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and a term &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt; that is substitutable for &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\phi^x_t \to \exists x. \phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Non-logical axioms===

'''Non-logical axioms''' are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions.  Reasoning about two different structures, for example the [[natural number]]s and the [[integer]]s, may involve the same logical axioms; the non-logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure (or set of structures, such as [[group (algebra)|groups]]).  Thus non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not ''tautologies''.  Another name for a non-logical axiom is ''postulate''.

Almost every modern [[mathematical theory]] starts from a given set of non-logical axioms, and it was thought that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas. This turned out to be impossible and proved to be quite a story (''[[#role|see below]]'').

Non-logical axioms are often simply referred to as ''axioms'' in mathematical discourse.  This does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense.  For example, in some [[group (algebra)|groups]], the group operation is [[commutative]], and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.

Thus, an ''axiom'' is an elementary basis for a formal logic system that together with the [[rules of inference]] define a '''deductive system'''.

====Examples====

This section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non-logical axioms (axioms, henceforth). A rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms.

Basic theories, such as [[arithmetic]], [[real analysis]] (sometimes referred to as ''the theory of functions of one real variable''), [[linear algebra]], and [[complex analysis]] (a.k.a. ''complex variables''), are often introduced non-axiomatically in mostly technical studies, but any rigorous course in these subjects always begins by presenting its axioms.

''Geometries'' such as [[Euclidean geometry]], [[projective geometry]], [[symplectic geometry]]. Interestingly one of the results of the fifth Euclidean axiom being a non-logical axiom is that the three angles of a triangle do not by definition add to 180°. Only under the umbrella of Euclidean geometry is this always true.

The study of topology in mathematics extends all over through [[point set topology]], [[algebraic topology]], [[differential topology]], and all the related paraphernalia, such as [[homology theory]], [[homotopy theory]]. 
The development of ''abstract algebra'' brought with itself [[group theory]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[Galois theory]].

This list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics, including [[axiomatic set theory]], [[measure theory]], [[ergodic theory]], [[probability]], [[representation theory]], and [[differential geometry]].

=====Arithmetic=====

The [[Peano axioms]] are the most widely used ''axiomatization'' of [[arithmetic]].  They are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about [[number theory]] and they allowed Gödel to establish his famous [[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem|second incompleteness theorem]].

We have a language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT} = \{0, S\}\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; is a constant symbol and &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unary function]] and the following axioms:

# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \lnot (Sx = 0) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \forall y. (Sx = Sy \to x = y) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;((\phi(0) \land \forall x.\,(\phi(x) \to \phi(Sx))) \to \forall x.\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT}\,&lt;/math&gt; formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; with one free variable.

The standard structure is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N} = \langle\N, 0, S\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\N\,&lt;/math&gt; is the set of natural numbers, &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[successor function]] and &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; is naturally interpreted as the number 0.

=====Euclidean geometry=====

Probably the oldest, and most famous, list of axioms are the 4 + 1 [[Euclid's postulates]] of [[plane geometry]].  This set of axioms turns out to be incomplete, and many more postulates are necessary to rigorously characterize his geometry ([[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] used 23).

The axioms are referred to as &quot;4 + 1&quot; because for nearly two millennia the [[parallel postulate|fifth (parallel) postulate]] (&quot;through a point outside a line there is exactly one parallel&quot;) was suspected of being derivable from the first four.  Ultimately, the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four.  Indeed, one can assume that no parallels through a point outside a line exist, that exactly one exists, or that infinitely many exist.  These choices give us alternative forms of geometry in which the interior [[angle]]s of a [[triangle]] add up to less than, exactly, or more than a straight line respectively and are known as [[elliptic geometry|elliptic]], [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]], and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] geometries.

=====Real analysis=====

The object of study is the [[real numbers]].  The real numbers are uniquely picked out (up to [[isomorphism]]) by the properties of a ''complete ordered field''. However, expressing these properties as axioms requires use of [[second-order logic]]. The [[Löwenheim-Skolem theorem]]s tell us that if we restrict ourselves to [[first-order logic]], any axiom system for the reals admits other models, including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger.  Some of the latter are studied in [[non-standard analysis]].

===&lt;span id=&quot;role&quot;&gt;Role in mathematical logic&lt;/span&gt;===

====Deductive systems and completeness====

A '''deductive system''' consists, of a set &lt;math&gt;\Lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; of logical axioms, a set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; of non-logical axioms, and a set &lt;math&gt;\{(\Gamma, \phi)\}\,&lt;/math&gt; of ''rules of inference''.  A desirable property of a deductive system is that it be '''complete'''.  A system is said to be complete if, for all formulas &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;center&gt;
if &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \phi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \vdash \phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

that is, for any statement that is a ''logical consequence'' of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; there actually exists a ''deduction'' of the statement from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt;.  This is sometimes expressed as &quot;everything that is true is provable&quot;, but it must be understood that &quot;true&quot; here means &quot;made true by the set of axioms&quot;, and not, for example, &quot;true in the intended interpretation&quot;.  [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] establishes the completeness of a certain commonly-used type of deductive system.

Note that &quot;completeness&quot; has a different meaning here than it does in the context of [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]], which states that no ''recursive'', ''consistent'' set of non-logical axioms &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; of the Theory of Arithmetic is ''complete'', in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; such that neither &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;\lnot\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; can be proved from the given set of axioms.

There is thus, on the one hand, the notion of '''''completeness of a deductive system''''' and on the other hand that of '''''completeness of a set of non-logical axioms'''''.  The completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem, despite their names, do not contradict one another.

===Further discussion===

Early [[mathematician]]s regarded axiomatic geometry as a model of [[physical space]], and obviously there could only be one such model. The idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the 19th century and the developers of systems such as [[Boolean algebra]] made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic.  [[Évariste Galois|Galois]] showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted, but that the grand parallels between axiomatic systems could be put to good use, as he algebraically solved many classical geometrical problems.  Ultimately, the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details and [[abstract algebra|modern algebra]] was born.  In the modern view we may take as axioms any set of formulas we like, as long as they are not known to be inconsistent.

:''For other uses, see [[Alpha]].''

'''Alpha''' (uppercase Α, lowercase α) is the first letter of the [[Greek alphabet]].  In the system of [[Greek numerals]] it has a value of 1. It derives from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] letter [[Aleph (letter)|'Aleph]][[Image:phoenician_aleph.png|20px|Aleph]]. Letters that arose from Alpha include the Latin [[A]] and the Cyrillic letter [[A (Cyrillic)|A]].

[[Plutarch]] in ''[[Moralia]]'' presents a discussion on the question of why the letter alpha stands first in the alphabet. Plutarch's speaker suggests that [[Cadmus]], the [[Phoenician]] who reputedly settled in [[Thebes]] and introduced the alphabet to Greece, &quot;placed ''alpha'' first because it is the Phoenician name for [[ox]], which they, like [[Hesiod]], considered not the second or third, but the first of necessities.&quot; This refers to a passage in ''[[Works and Days]]'' by Hesiod, who advised the early Greek farmers, &quot;First get an ox, then a woman.&quot;  A simpler explanation is that it was the first letter in the Phoenician alphabet.

According to Plutarch's natural order of attribution of the [[vowel]]s to the [[planet]]s, alpha was connected with the [[Moon]]. Oxen were also associated with the Moon in both early [[Sumerian]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] religious symbolism due to the crescent shape of their horns.

Alpha, both as a symbol and term, is used to refer to or describe a variety of things, including the first or most significant occurrence of something.  [[Jesus]] declares himself to be the &quot;Alpha and [[Omega]], the beginning and the end, the first and the last.&quot; ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 22:13, KJV, and see also 1:8).

The uppercase letter alpha is not generally used as a symbol because it tends to be rendered identically to the uppercase [[A|latin A]].

The lower-case letter α is used as the symbol for the following in physics:
* [[Angular acceleration]].
* The [[alpha particle]] and [[alpha decay]].
* Molecular polarisability.

==Other uses==

Alpha is also used to describe the strongest male in a pack of animals, known as the alphamale.

'''Alvin Toffler''' (born [[October 3]], [[1928]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[writer]] and [[futures studies|futurist]], known for his works discussing the [[digital revolution]], [[communications revolution]], [[corporate revolution]] and [[technological singularity]]. A former associate editor of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine, his early work focused on technology and its impact (through effects like [[information overload]]). Then he moved to examining the reaction of and [[Social change|changes in society]]. His later focus has been on the increasing power of [[21st century]] military hardware, weapons and technology proliferation, and [[capitalism]]. He is married to [[Heidi Toffler]], also a writer and futurist.

== His ideas ==

Toffler explains, &quot;Society needs people who take care of the elderly and who know how to be compassionate and honest.  Society needs people who work in hospitals.  Society needs all kinds of skill that are not just cognitive; they're emotional, they're affectional.  You can't run the society on data and computers alone.&quot;

In his book ''The Third Wave'' Toffler describes three types of societies, based on the concept of 'waves' - each wave pushes the older societies and cultures aside.
*First Wave is the society after [[agrarian revolution]] and replaced the first [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures.
*The main components of the Second Wave society are [[nuclear family]], factory-type education system and the [[corporation]]. Toffler writes: &quot;The Second Wave Society is industrial and based on [[mass production]], [[mass distribution]], [[mass consumption]], [[mass education]], [[mass media]], [[mass recreation]], [[mass entertainment]], and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. You combine those things with [[standardization]], [[centralization]], concentration, and synchronization, and you wind up with a style of [[organization]] we call [[bureaucracy]].&quot; 
*Third Wave is the [[post-industrial]] society. Toffler would also add that since late 1950s most countries are moving away from a Second Wave Society into what he would call a Third Wave Society.  He coined lots of words to describe it and mentions names invented by other people, like the [[Information Age]].

In this post-industrial society, there is a lot of diversity in [[lifestyle]]s (&quot;subcults&quot;).
[[Adhocracy|Adhocracies]] (fluid organizations like, say, the [[Wikipedia community]]) adapt quickly to [[change]]s.
[[Information]] can substitute most of the material resources (see [[ersatz]]) and becomes the main material for workers ([[cognitarian]]s instead of [[proletarian]]s), who are loosely affiliated.
[[Mass customization]] offers the possibility of cheap, personalized, production catering to small niches (see [[Just In Time]] production).
The gap between producer and consumer is bridged by technology.
&quot;[[Prosumer]]s&quot; can fill their own needs (see [[open source]], [[assembly kit]], [[freelance]] work).

Since the 1960s, people have been trying to make sense of the impact of new technologies and social change. Toffler's writings have been influential beyond the confines of scientific, economic and public policy discussions.  [[Techno music]] pioneer [[Juan Atkins]] cites Toffler's phrase &quot;techno rebels&quot; in ''Future Shock'' as inspiring him to use the word &quot;techno&quot; to describe the [[musical genre|musical style]] he helped to create.

Toffler's works and ideas have been subject to various criticism, usually with the same argumentation used against [[future studies|futurology]], that is that foreseeing the future is nigh impossible. In the 1990s, his ideas were publicly lauded by [[Newt Gingrich]].

== His books ==

A few of his well-known works are:

* ''[[Future Shock]]'' ([[1970]]) Bantam Books ISBN 0553277375
* ''[[The Eco-Spasm Report]]'' ([[1975]]) Bantam Books ISBN 055314474X

[[Image:Firstissue.jpg|thumb|Cover to ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1 (Volume 1), March 1963, by [[Steve Ditko]].]]
'''''The Amazing Spider-Man''''' is the title of a [[comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]], a [[television program]] and a daily [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]]. All three feature the adventures of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]].

==Comic book ==

Spider-Man originally appeared in issue #15 of the comic book ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'', its final issue.  The series was cancelled with that issue, but response to the character was so positive that the new title, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' was launched, issue #1 appearing in March 1963.

The character was created by writer/editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist/cowriter [[Steve Ditko]], and the pair produced 38 issues of ''Amazing''.  A disagreement over a story led to Ditko leaving the title after that point.  He was replaced by penciller [[John Romita, Sr.|John Romita]] who illustrated Lee's stories for several years. Although many fans thought that the writing quality almost instantly plummeted, the series became still more popular.

Many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic over the years chronicling the adventures of Marvel's most identifiable hero. The title was published continuously until 1998 when Marvel Comics decided to begin anew by renumbering the title with a new issue #1 published in January, 1999. In 2003 this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series, at issue #500.

As of October 2005, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' is participating in &quot;[[Spider-Man: The Other|The Other]]&quot;, a 12-part crossover, which will conclude in January 2006.

[[Image:Blackissue.jpg|thumb|Cover to ''The Black Issue'' which is just a black background.]]
===Black Issue===

An issue of Amazing Spider-Man (Vol. 2) called &quot;The Black Issue&quot; explores how Spider-Man and other heroes would react to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and penciled by [[John Romita, Jr]]. It starts with a double page spread of the devastation and of Spidey holding his head in pain/anguish/disbelief, his only word &quot;...God...&quot; The issue continues as Spidey swings down to help in the aftermath. Joining with other heroes in the rescue efforts, Spidey explores the wreckage and the broken hearts and his thoughts drive on, thinking through it all. At some point his thoughts become Straczynski's reflections and response. The script journeys from horror, pain and loss to end on strength.

==Television program==
{{main|The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)}}
Spidey got his shot at live-action TV stardom in April 1977, when he debuted in the &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; TV series.  Nicholas Hammond portrayed Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the short-lived series, which had started out as a slew of TV-movies, obviously made to capitalize on the [[The Incredible Hulk]] television series.  The show was canceled a year after its debut.

==Newspaper comic strip==

The daily newspaper comic strip began on [[January 3]], [[1977]]. It was first written by Spider-Man co-creator [[Stan Lee]] and illustrated by [[John Romita, Sr.|John Romita]].  The strip was surprisingly successful in an era with few serialized adventure strips.  The strip slowly grew in circulation and [[as of 2006]] is still being published.  Lee's brother [[Larry Lieber]] illustrated and later wrote the strip for much of its run. While the strip and the comic book feature the same characters, they do not share the same [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], and the strip has had a decreased emphasis on [[supervillain]] enemies.  A rare exception was the 1987 wedding of [[Peter Parker]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]] which occurred in both the comic book and the comic strip.  Guest stars in the newspaper strip include [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Dr. Strange]].  Villains include [[Dr. Doom]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], and [[The Rhino]].  Stories from the strip have been reprinted in paperback and in [[Comics Revue]] magazine.

==Video and computer games==
{{see details|Spider-Man (games)}}
Numerous video and computer games have been released whereby the player controlled Spider-Man and had to do battle with various enemies.

==Trivia==
The 2004 movie ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' was at one point tentatively titled ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Antigua and Barbuda infobox}}
'''Antigua and Barbuda''' is an [[island nation]] located in the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]] on the boundary with the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. [[Antigua]] ({{IPA2|ænˈtiːgə}}) and [[Barbuda]] ({{IPA2|bɑrˈbjuːdə}})are located in the middle of the [[Leeward Islands]] in the Eastern [[Caribbean]], roughly 17 degrees north of the equator. Antigua and Barbuda are part of the [[Lesser Antilles]] [[archipelago]] with the archipelago of [[Guadeloupe]] to the south, [[Montserrat]] to the southwest, [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] to the west and [[Saint Barthélemy]] and [[Saint Martin]] to the northwest. 
== History ==
''Main article: [[History of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

Pre-ceramic [[Amerindian]]s were the first to inhabit the islands of Antigua and [[Barbuda]] in [[2400 BC]]. Later [[Arawak]] and [[Carib]] [[Amerindian]] tribes populated the islands. The island of Antigua was originally named Wadadli by the natives.  [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on his second voyage in 1493 and gave the island the name Antigua. Early settlements by the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[France|French]] were succeeded by the [[United Kingdom|English]] who formed a [[colony]] in 1667 by transporting [[Irish Catholic]] slaves to Antigua. [[Slavery]], established to run the [[sugar]] plantations on Antigua, was abolished in 1834. 

The islands became an independent state within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on [[1 November]] [[1981]], and [[Vere Bird]] became the first [[prime minister]].

== Politics ==
''Main article:'' [[Politics of Antigua and Barbuda]]

Antigua and Barbuda is a [[Commonwealth Realm]] and the [[head of state]] is [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], who is represented in Antigua and Barbuda by a [[governor general]]. [[executive branch|Executive power]] is in the hands of the [[prime minister]], who is also the [[head of government]]. The prime minister is usually the leader of the winning party of the elections for the [[House of Representatives of Antigua and Barbuda|House of Representatives]] (17 members), held every five years. The other chamber of the [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|parliament]], the [[Senate of Antigua and Barbuda|Senate]], has 17 members which are appointed by the governor general. Its current prime minister is [[Baldwin Spencer]] ([[24 March]] [[2004]]-).

== Administrative Divisions ==
''Main article: [[Parishes and dependencies of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

The island of Antigua is divided into six [[parish]]es:-

{|

The island of [[Barbuda]] and the uninhabited island of [[Redonda]] each enjoy dependency status.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Antigua and Barbuda map.png|250px|thumb|right| ]] 
:''Main article: [[Geography of Antigua and Barbuda]]''
The country consists of a number of islands, of which Antigua is the largest one, and the most populated. [[Barbuda]], just north of Antigua is the other main island. The islands have a warm, tropical [[climate]], with fairly constant temperatures year round. The un-inhabited island of [[Redonda]] also belongs to the nation of Antigua and Barbuda.

The islands are mostly low-lying, with the highest point being [[Boggy Peak]], at 402 [[metre]]s (1,319 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The small country's main town is the capital [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint John's]] on Antigua; Barbuda's largest town is [[Codrington]].

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

[[Tourism]] dominates its economy, accounting for more than half of its [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. Weak tourist arrival numbers since early 2000 have slowed the economy, however, and pressed the government into a tight fiscal corner. The dual-island nation's [[agriculture|agricultural]] production is focused on the domestic market and constrained by a limited [[water supply]] and a [[labour (economics)|labour]] shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction work. 

[[Manufacturing]] comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for [[economic growth]] in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialised world, especially in the [[United States]], which accounts for about one-third of all tourist arrivals.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

Most of the population are descendants of the slaves that used to work in the sugar plantations, but there are also groups of Europeans, notably [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]], British and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. While the official language is [[English language|English]], most of the locals speak [[patois]], a form of [[Creole language#English Creole|Creole English]].

Almost all Antiguans are [[Christianity|Christians]], with the [[Anglican Church]] (about 44%) being the largest denomination.

==Foreign relations==
''Main article: [[Foreign relations of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the [[Caribbean Community]], [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Organization of American States]], [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]], and the Eastern Caribbean's [[Regional Security System]].

'''''A Man for All Seasons''''' is a play by [[Robert Bolt]], first performed in [[London]] on [[July 1]] [[1960]]. It has subsequently been made into a feature film and a television movie.

{{spoiler}}

The plot is based on the true story of Sir [[Thomas More]], the [[16th century|16th-century]] Chancellor of [[England]], who refuses to endorse or denounce the [[monarch|king's]] wish to divorce his aging wife so that he can marry his mistress. The King is [[Henry VIII of England]] and his wife is [[Catherine of Aragon]], the first of an eventual six.  

The play portrays More as a man of principle, envied by rivals such as [[Thomas Cromwell]] and loved by the common people and by his family.  

[[Image:A Man for All Seasons.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Thomas More ([[Paul Scofield]]) is accused of [[high treason]] by Cromwell ([[Leo McKern]]) - 1966 film]] [[Paul Scofield]], who played the leading role in the [[West End]], reprised it on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[1962]], winning a [[Tony Award]], and played More again in the first of two film versions ([[1966]]), winning an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]] in the process. The film also stars [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Henry VIII, [[Orson Welles]] as [[Thomas Cardinal Wolsey|Wolsey]], a young [[John Hurt]] as More's nemesis [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]], and an older [[Wendy Hiller]] as More's second wife. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]]. In addition to the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] won by Scofield, the film won [[Academy Awards]] for screenplay, [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|cinematography]], costume design, [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].  

The [[1988]] version stars [[Charlton Heston]] (who also directed it) as More, [[Vanessa Redgrave]] (who appeared briefly in the [[1966]] version as [[Anne Boleyn]]) as More's wife, and Sir [[John Gielgud]] as Cardinal Wolsey.

More recently, the play has been staged in London's West End at the [[Theatre Royal]], Haymarket starring [[Martin Shaw]] and produced by [[Bill Kenwright]].  It closes on [[1 April]] [[2006]].

==Quotation==
[[Image:man4all.JPG|thumb|200px]]

'''Alice:'''    Arrest him!

'''More:'''     Why, what has he done? 

'''Margaret:''' He's bad! 

'''More:'''     There is no law against that. 

'''Roper:'''    There is! God's law! 

'''More:'''     Then God can arrest him. 

'''Roper:'''    Sophistication upon sophistication. 

'''More:'''     No, sheer simplicity. The law, Roper, the law. I know what's legal, not what's right. And I'll stick to what's legal. 

'''Roper:'''    Then you set man's law above God's! 

'''More:'''     No, far below; but let me draw your attention to a fact -- I'm not God. The currents and eddies of right and wrong, which you find such plain sailing, I can't navigate. I'm no voyager. But in the thickets of the law, oh, there I'm a forrester.I doubt if there's a man alive who could follow me there, thank God. 

'''Alice:'''    While you talk, he's gone! 

'''More:'''     And go he should, if he was the Devil himself, until he broke the law! 

'''Roper:'''    So now you'd give the Devil benefit of law! 

'''More:'''     Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? 

'''Roper:'''    I'd cut down every law in England to do that! 

'''More:'''     Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast -- man's laws, not God's -- and if you cut them down -- and you're just the man to do it -- do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake.
 
----
'''More:'''     It profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world ... but for Wales, Richard?

'''Azincourt''' (sometimes: '''Agincourt''') is a village and [[commune in France|commune]] of northern [[France]] in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] ''[[départment]]'', 14 miles to the north-west of [[Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise]] by road, famous on account of the victory, on [[October 25]] [[1415]], of [[Henry V of England]] over the French in the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. Population (1999): 276.

The original museum of the battle featuring model knights fabricated from [[Action Man]] has given way to a more professional space with slide shows, audio commentary's and some interactive elements. The museum building is itself modelled on the [[English longbow]] of the English soldiers.

[[Image:speer portrait.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Albert Speer]]

{{Audio|De-Albert_Speer.ogg|'''Albert Speer'''}} ([[March 19]], [[1905]] &amp;ndash; [[September 1]], [[1981]]) was born ''Berthold Konrad Hermann Albert Speer'' in [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]], the second of three sons. He is sometimes called 'the first architect of the [[Third Reich]]'. He  was [[Hitler|Hitler's]] chief [[architect]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and in [[1942]] became Hitler's minister of armaments, when he had considerable success in reforming and streamlining Germany's war production. After the war he was tried at [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg]] where he expressed remorse and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. After his release, he became a successful author, writing a number of semi-autobiographical works until his death in 1981 from a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].

==Early years==
Although Speer originally wanted to become a [[mathematics|mathematician]] when he was young, he ended up following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture. He began his architectural studies at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; his decision to study locally instead of at one of the more prestigious institutes was dictated by the inflation of 1923. In 1924 when the inflation had stabilised, Speer transferred his studies to the more esteemed Munich Institute of Technology. In 1925 he transferred again, this time to the Berlin Institute of Technology. It was there that he was under the tutelage of [[Heinrich Tessenow]], Speer had a high regard for Tessenow and when he passed his exams in 1927 he became Tessenow's assistant. His duties as assistant involved teaching seminar classes three days a week. Although Tessenow himself never agreed with [[Nazism]], a number of his students did, and it was they who persuaded Speer to attend a [[Nazi Party]] rally in a Berlin beer-hall in December 1930. 

Speer claims to have been apolitical as a young man; nevertheless, he did attend the rally. He was surprised to find Hitler dressed in a neat blue suit, rather than the brown uniform seen on Nazi Party posters. Speer claimed to have been quite affected, not only with Hitler's proposed solutions to the threat of communism and his renunciation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], but also with the man himself. Several weeks later he attended another rally, though this one was presided over by [[Goebbels|Joseph Goebbels]]. Speer was disturbed by the way he had whipped the crowd into a frenzy, playing on their hopes. Although Goebbels' performance offended Speer, he could not shake the impressions Hitler made on him. The next day he joined the Nazi Party as member number 474,481. In this same year ([[1931]]) he married [[Margarete Weber]].

Speer's first major commission as a Party member came in [[1932]] when [[Karl Hanke]] (whose [[villa]] Speer previously worked on) recommended him to Goebbels to help renovate the new District Headquarters in [[Berlin]], and, later, to renovate Goebbels' [[Propaganda]] Ministry.  Goebbels was impressed with his work and recommended him to Hitler, who assigned him to help [[Paul Troost]] renovate the Chancellery in Berlin.  Speer's most notable work on this assignment was the addition of the famous balcony from which Hitler often presented himself to crowds that assembled below. Speer subsequently became a prominent member of Hitler's inner circle and a very close friend to him, winning a special place with Hitler that was unique amongst the Nazi leadership. Hitler, according to Speer, was very contemptuous towards anybody he viewed as part of the [[bureaucracy]], and prized fellow artists like Speer whom he felt a certain kinship with, especially as Hitler himself had previously entertained architectural ambitions.

==First Architect of the Reich==
When Troost died in [[1934]], Speer was chosen to replace him as the Party's chief architect.  One of his first commissions after promotion was perhaps the most familiar of his designs: the [[Zeppelintribune]], the [[Nuremberg]] parade grounds seen in [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s propaganda masterpiece, ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. In his autobiography, Speer claimed that, upon seeing the original design, he made a derogatory remark to the effect that the parade ground would resemble a &quot;rifle club&quot; meet. He was then challenged to create a new design.

The grounds were based on ancient [[Doric order|Doric]] architecture of the [[Pergamon Altar]] in [[Anatolia]], but magnified to an enormous scale, capable of holding two hundred and forty thousand people.  At the 1934 Party rally on the parade grounds, Speer surrounded the site with one hundred and thirty [[anti-aircraft]] [[searchlight|searchlights]].  This created the effect of a &quot;cathedral of light,&quot; (which referenced [[columns]]) or, as it was called by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ambassador|Ambassador]] [[Sir Neville Henderson]], a &quot;cathedral of ice&quot;.

Nuremberg was also to be the site of many more official Nazi buildings, most of which were never built; for example, the German Stadium would have held another four hundred thousand spectators as the site of the [[Aryan Games]], a proposed replacement for the [[Olympic Games]].  While planning these buildings, Speer invented the theory of &quot;[[ruin value]].&quot;  According to this theory, enthusiastically supported by Hitler, all new buildings would be constructed in such a way that they would leave aesthetically pleasing ruins thousands of years in the future.  Such ruins would be a testament to the greatness of the [[Third Reich]], just as ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins were symbols of the greatness of their civilizations.  
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:German pavilion 1937 exhibition.jpg|frame|right|Speer's German pavilion at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 international exposition in Paris]].]] --&gt;

In [[1937]] Speer designed the [[Germany|German]] Pavilion for the [[Exposition Internationale de Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 international exposition in Paris]]. Speer's work was located directly across from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Pavilion and was designed to represent a massive defense against the onslaught of [[communism]]. Both pavilions were awarded gold medals for their designs.

Speer was also directed to make plans to rebuild Berlin, which was to become the [[capital]] of a &quot;Greater Germany&quot; &amp;mdash; [[Welthauptstadt Germania]]. The first step in these plans was the [[Olympic Stadium, Berlin|Olympic Stadium]] for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], designed by [[Werner March]]. Speer also designed the [[new German Reichs Chancellery|new Reichs Chancellery]], which included a vast hall designed to be twice as long as the [[Hall of Mirrors]] in the [[Palace of Versailles]].  Hitler wanted him to build a third, even larger Chancellery, although it was never begun.  The second Chancellery was damaged by the [[Battle of Berlin]] in [[1945]] and was eventually demolished  by the Soviet occupiers after the war.
[[Image:Adolf Hitler in Paris.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Speer (left) with Hitler and [[Arno Breker]] in Paris, [[June 23]], [[1940]].]]

Almost none of the other buildings planned for Berlin were ever built. Berlin was to be reorganized along a central three-mile-(five km) long avenue.  At the north end, Speer planned to build the ''[[Volkshalle]]'' &amp;mdash; an enormous [[dome|domed]] building, based on [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].  The dome of the building would have been impractically large; it would be over seven hundred feet (over two hundred meters) high and eight hundred feet (three hundred meters) in diameter, sixteen times larger than the dome of St. Peter's.  At the southern end of the avenue would be an [[arch]] based on the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris, but again, much larger; it would be almost four hundred feet (120 m) high, and the Arc de Triomphe would have been able to fit inside its opening.  The outbreak of [[World War II]] in [[1939]] led to the abandonment of these plans.

During his involvement in the rebuilding of Berlin, he was allegedly responsible for the forced evictions of [[Jew]]s from their houses to make room for his grand plans, and for re-housing German citizens affected by this work. He was also listed as being present at the 1943 [[Posen Conference]], a charge Speer later contested by saying that he had in fact left early.

Speer did have an architectural rival: [[Hermann Giesler]], whom Hitler also favored.  There were frequent clashes between the two in regard to architectural matters and in closeness to Hitler.

==Minister of Armaments==
Hitler was always a strong supporter of Speer, in part because of Hitler's own frustrated artistic and architectural visions. A strong affinity developed between Hitler and the ambitious young architect early in their professional relationship. For Speer, serving as architect for the head of the German state and being given virtual ''carte blanche'' as to expenses, presented a tremendous opportunity. For Hitler, Speer seemed to be capable of translating Hitler's grandiose visions into tangible designs which expressed what Hitler felt were [[Nazism|National Socialist]] principles.

After Minister of Armaments and War Production [[Fritz Todt]] was killed in an airplane crash in [[1942]], Hitler appointed Speer as his successor in all of his posts. Hitler's affinity for Speer and the architect's efficiency and avoidance of party squabbling are believed to have been considerations in Speer's promotion. In his autobiography, Speer recounts that the power-hungry but lazy [[Hermann Göring]] raced to Hitler's headquarters upon word of Todt's death, hoping to claim the office. Hitler instead presented Göring with the ''fait accompli'' of Speer's appointment. 

Faced with this new responsibility, Speer tried to put the German economy on a war footing comparable to that of the [[Allied]] nations, but found himself incessantly hindered by party politics and lack of cooperation from the Nazi hierarchy. Nevertheless, by slowly centralizing almost all industry control and cutting through the dense [[bureaucracy]], he succeeded in multiplying war production four times over the next two and a half years, with it actually reaching its peak in 1944 during the height of the [[Allied]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II | strategic bombing campaign]]. Another big hurdle in his way was the Nazi policy excluding women from factory work, a serious hindrance in war production and a problem unknown to Germany's enemies, who all made full use of the female workforce. To fill this gap, Speer made heavy use of foreign labor, a considerable portion of it [[forced labor]].

Speer was considered one of the more &quot;rational&quot; members of the Nazi hierarchy, in contrast to the raging [[Hitler]], grotesque [[Hermann Göring|Göring]], fanatical [[Goebbels]], and perverse [[Himmler]].
Speer's name was found on the list of members of a post-Hitler government envisioned by the [[July 20 plot]] to kill Hitler.
However, the list had an annotation &quot;if possible&quot; by his name, which Speer credits with helping save his life from the extensive purges that followed the scheme's failure.
By his own account, Speer considered [[assassin|assassinating]] Hitler in [[1945]] by releasing poison gas into the air intake vent on the [[Führerbunker]], but backed down for a number of reasons. Independent evidence for this is sparse. Some credit his revelation of this plan at the [[Nuremberg trials]] as being pivotal in sparing him the [[death sentence]], which the [[Soviet]]s had pushed for.

Hitler continued to consider Speer trustworthy, though this trust waned near the war's end as Speer, at considerable risk, campaigned clandestinely to prevent the implementation of Hitler's [[scorched earth]] policy on both German soil and occupied territories. Speer worked in association with General [[Gotthard Heinrici]], whose troops fighting in the east retreated to the American-held lines and surrendered there instead of following Hitler's orders to make what would have been a suicidal effort to hold off the Soviets from Berlin.

Speer even confessed to Hitler shortly before the dictator's suicide that he had disobeyed, and indeed actively hindered, Hitler's &quot;scorched-earth&quot; decree.
According to Speer's autobiography, Speer visited the [[Führerbunker]] towards the end and stated gently but bluntly to Hitler that the war was lost and expressed his opposition to the systematic destruction of Germany while reaffirming his affection and faith in Hitler. This conversation, it is said, brought Hitler to tears. In disfavor, Speer was excluded from the new cabinet Hitler outlined in his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler |  final political testament]], where Speer was to be replaced by his subordinate, [[Karl-Otto Saur]].

==After the war==
[[Image:Albert-Speer-72-929.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Speer at the Nuremberg Trials]]
===Nuremberg trials===
Immediately after the war, there seemed to be little indication that Speer would be charged with [[war crimes]]. Speer traveled unprotected and openly participated in the so-called [[Flensburg government]] for weeks, in the presence of Allied officers. Upon request, he actually held a series of widely-attended lectures for officials of the Allied occupying powers on various topics, including the mistakes made by the Nazi government in industrial and economic affairs (although he never during these lectures spoke about slave labor) and the effectiveness of the Allied [[strategic bombing]] campaigns. Some [[journalists]] and spectators even expected that Speer would be appointed by the occupying powers to help restore Germany's economy. However, any such speculation ended when, after one of these lectures, he was arrested and sent to Nuremberg for trial.
At the [[Nuremberg trials]] after the war Speer was one of the few officials to express remorse and plead guilty, but was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment in [[Spandau Prison]], [[West Berlin]], largely for his use of slave labor. At the trials, the prosecution introduced as evidence a photograph of Speer visiting the [[Mauthausen]] [[concentration camp]], where he is clearly shown surrounded by emaciated prisoners. The prosecution claimed this proved Speer was well aware of [[The Holocaust|the Holocaust]]. However, Speer held that he was only given a &quot;V.I.P.&quot; tour of the concentration camp, meaning he was never shown the more vile side of the camp's purpose.

According to interviews after his imprisonment, as well as his memoirs, Speer adopted a &quot;see no evil&quot; attitude towards the Nazi atrocities. For example, through one of his friends, [[Karl Hanke]], he learned of [[Auschwitz (concentration camp)|Auschwitz]] and the large number of deaths taking place there. He then purposely avoided visiting the camp or trying to get more information on what was taking place. In his autobiography, he claims that he had no direct involvement or knowledge of the Holocaust, although he faults himself for blinding himself to its existence. He certainly was aware, at least, of harsh conditions for the slave labor and some critics believe that his books understate his role in the atrocities of the era.  [http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/05/11/wspeer11.xml Newly released documents] suggest that Speer knew a lot more about the atrocities than he was telling, but hard evidence for that remains very thin.

One problem with assessments of Speer's complicity in the Holocaust comes from his status in post-war Germany - he became a symbol for people who were involved with the Nazi regime yet did not have (or claimed not to have had) any part in the regime's atrocities. Even today, German historians such as [[Joachim Fest]] tend to have a high opinion of him, while non-German historians take a lower view. As [[film director]] [[Heinrich Breloer]] remarked in the above-linked article:

::''[Speer created] a market for people who said &quot;believe me, I didn't know anything about [the Holocaust]. Just look at the Führer's friend, he didn't know about it either.&quot;''

===Imprisonment===
:''Main article: [[Spandau Prison]]''

His time in prison, painstakingly documented in his secret prison diary which was later released as ''[[The Spandau Diaries]]'', was described as consisting mainly of a mind-numbing and pedantically enforced daily routine, incessant petty personal rivalry between the seven prisoners, a pervasive and bloated prison [[bureaucracy]], and the passing of many false hopes of premature release. After some time Speer, and most of the others, had established secret lines of communication to the outside world via sympathetic prison staff. Speer made full use of this by, amongst other things, writing innumerable letters to his family (which were restricted to one outgoing page per month under official regulation) and even having money spent on his behalf from a special bank account for a variety of benign purposes.

Speer, as recounted in his diary, made a deliberate effort to make as productive use of his time as possible. In the first decade, this took the form of putting on paper the first draft of his tell-all [[memoirs]], an act Speer considered to be his &quot;duty&quot; to history and his people, he being the sole surviving member of Hitler's inner circle and in possession of knowledge and a degree of objectivity that no other had. As the prison directors both forbade the writing of a memoir and recorded each sheet of paper given to the prisoners, he wrote much of his memoir secretly on toilet paper, tobacco wrappings, and any other material he could get his hands on, and then had the pages systematically smuggled out.

All the while Speer devoted much of his energy and time towards reading books from the prison library, which was organized by fellow prisoner and ex-[[Grand Admiral]] [[Erich Raeder]]. Speer was, more so than the others, a voracious reader and he completed well over 500 books in the first three years alone.{{ref|spandau}} His tastes ranged from Greek drama to famous plays to architectural books and journals, partly from which he collected information for a book he intended to write on the history and function of windows in architecture.

Later, Speer took to the prison garden for enjoyment and work. Heretofore the garden was divided up into small personal plots for each prisoner with the produce of the garden being used in the prison kitchen. When regulations began to slacken in this regard, Speer was allowed to build an ambitious garden, complete with a meandering path, [[rock garden]], and a wide variety of flowers. The garden was even, humorously, centered around a &quot;north-south axis&quot;, which was to be the core design element of Speer and Hitler's new Berlin. Speer then took up a &quot;walking tour of the world&quot; by ordering geography and travel books from the local library and walking laps in the prison garden visualizing his journey. Meticulously calculating every metre traveled, he began in northern Germany, went through the [[Balkans]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[India]], and [[Siberia]], then crossed the [[Bering Strait]] and continued southwards, finally ending his sentence in central [[Mexico]].

===Release===
His release from prison in [[1966]] was a world-wide media event. He then revised and published the several semi-[[autobiography|autobiographical]] books he had begun in prison.  His books, most notably ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'' and ''The Spandau Diaries'', which were secretly written during his incarceration and systematically smuggled out, provide a unique and personal look into the personalities of the Nazi era and have become much valued by historians. Speer died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] in [[London]], [[England]], on [[September 1]], [[1981]] — exactly 42 years after World War II began.

Speer's son, also named Albert, became a successful [[architect]] in his own right, and was responsible for the design of [[Expo 2000]] (the [[world exposition]] that took place in [[Hanover]] in the year 2000), design of the [[Shanghai]] International Automobile City and the Beijing Olympic complex. His daughter [[Hilde Schramm]] became a noted left-wing parliamentarian.

'''Alliaceae''' is a [[Family (biology)|family]] of herbaceous [[perennial]] plants. They are [[monocot]]s, part of [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Asparagales]].

Genus ''[[Allium]]'' includes several important food plants, including [[onion]]s (''Allium cepa''), [[chives]] (''A. schoenoprasum''), [[garlic]] (''A. sativum'' and ''A. scordoprasum''), and [[Leek (vegetable)|leek]]s (''A. porrum'').

The Alliaceae are closely related to two other families in the order Asparagales, the amaryllis family ([[Amaryllidaceae]]) and the family [[Agapanthaceae]], which includes the single genus ''[[Agapanthus]]''. Based on the close relationship between the three families, the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] recognizes the alternative of including the Amaryllidaceae and the Agapanthaceae in family Alliaceae.

== Genera ==
Several genera that were historically classified in the Alliaceae, including ''[[Androstephium]]'', ''[[Bessera]]'', ''[[Bloomeria]]'', ''[[Brodiaea]]'', ''[[Dandya]]'', ''[[Dichelostemma]]'', ''[[Milla]]'', ''[[Petronymphe]]'', ''[[Triteleia]]'', and ''[[Triteleiopsis]]'', are now increasingly thought to represent a separate family, [[Themidaceae]].

The family '''Asteraceae''' or, alternatively, family '''Compositae''', known as the '''aster''', '''daisy''' or '''sunflower family''', is a taxon of [[dicot|dicotyledonous]] [[flowering plant]]s.  The family name is derived from the genus ''[[Aster (flower)|Aster]]'' and refers to the [[star]]-shaped flower head of its members, typified well by the [[daisy]].  The Asteraceae is the second largest family in the Division [[Flowering plant|Magnoliophyta]], with some 1,100 genera and over 20,000 recognized species. Only the orchid family ([[Orchidaceae]]) is larger, with about 25,000 described species.

Plants belonging to the Asteraceae must share ALL the following characteristics (Judd et al., 1999). None of these traits, taken separately, can be considered [[Synapomorphy|synapomorphic]].
* [[Inflorescence]]: a capitulum or flower head
* Syngenesious [[anther]]s, i.e. with the stamens fused together at their edges by the anthers, forming a tube
* [[Ovary]] with basal arrangement of the ovules
* [[Ovule]]s one per ovary
* Pappus (a tuft of hairs on a fruit)
* The fruit is an [[achene]]
* [[Terpene|Sesquiterpenes]] present in the essential oils, but iridoids lacking.

[[Image:Bidens_flwr.jpg|thumb|left|A typical Asteraceae flower head (here ''[[Bidens torta]]'') showing the individual flowers]]
The most common characteristic of all these plants, is that what in common parlance might be called a &quot;flower&quot;, is an inflorescence or '''flower head'''; a densely packed cluster of many small, individual [[flowers]], usually  called '''florets''' (meaning &quot;small flowers&quot;). 

Plants in the family Asteraceae typically have one or both of two kinds of ''florets''. The outer perimeter of a flower head like that of a [[sunflower]] is composed of florets possessing a long strap-like [[petal]], termed a '''ligule'''; these are the '''ray florets'''. The inner portion of the flower head (or ''disc'') is composed of small flowers with tubular [[petal|corolla]]s; these are the '''disc florets'''. The composition of asteraceous inflorescences varies from all ray flowers (like [[dandelion]]s, genus ''Taraxacum'') to all disc flowers (like [[pineapple weed]]s).

The composite nature of the inflorescences of these plants led early taxonomists to call this family the Compositae. Although the rules governing naming conventions for plant families state that the name should come from the [[biological type|type genus]], in this case ''Aster'' and thus Asteraceae. However, the long prevailing name Compositae is also authorized as an alternative family name ([[ICBN]] Art. 18.6). 

The numerous genera are divided into about 13 tribes. Only one of these, Lactuceae, is considered distinct enough to be a subfamily (subfamily Cichorioideae); the remainer, which are mostly overlapping, are put in the subfamily Asteroideae (Wagner, Herbst, and Sohmer, 1990).    

==Uses==
Commercially important plants in the Asteraceae include the food crops [[lettuce]], [[chicory]], [[globe artichoke]], [[sunflower]], and [[Jerusalem artichoke]]. [[Guayule]] is a source of [[hypoallergenic]] [[latex]].

Many members of Asteracae are copious [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] producers and are useful for evaluating [[pollinator]] populations during their bloom. ''Centaurea'' (knapweed), ''Helianthus annuus'' (domestic sunflower), and some species of ''Solidago'' (goldenrod) are major &quot;[[honey]] plants&quot; for [[beekeeper]]s. ''Solidago'' produces relatively high protein [[pollen]], which helps [[honeybee]]s overwinter.

Many members of the family are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers, e.g., [[chrysanthemums]] and some are important ornamental crops for the cut flower industry.  Some Asteraceae are economically important in the sense that they are considered noxious [[weeds]], e.g., [[dandelions]].

The '''Apiaceae''' or '''Umbelliferae''' (both names are allowed by the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|ICBN]]) are a family of usually aromatic [[plant]]s with hollow stems, including [[parsley]], [[carrot]], and other relatives. It is a large family with about 300 [[genus|genera]] and more than 3,000 [[species]]. The earlier name Umbelliferae derives from the [[inflorescence]] being in the form of a compound &quot;umbel&quot;.

The small flowers are radially symmetrical with 5 small [[sepal]]s, 5 [[petal]]s and 5 [[stamen]]s.

The family contains some highly [[toxic]] plants, such as [[hemlock]], which was used to execute [[Socrates]] and also used to poison arrow tips. It also contains some highly useful plants, such as carrots, parsley, [[caraway]], and [[fennel]]. Many plants in this family, such as [[wild carrot]] have [[estrogen]]ic properties, and have been used as [[folk medicine]] for [[birth control]]. Most notable for this use is the extinct giant fennel, [[silphium]].

Notable members include:
*''Anethum graveolens'' - [[Dill]]
*''Anthriscus cerefolium'' - [[Chervil]]
*''Angelica'' spp. - [[Angelica]]
*''Apium graveolens'' - [[Celery]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''axon''', or '''nerve fiber''', is a long slender projection of a nerve cell, or [[neuron]], that conducts [[action potential|electrical impulses]] away from the neuron's [[cell body]] or soma. Axons are in effect the primary transmission lines of the [[nervous system]], and as bundles they help make up [[nerve]]s. Individual axons are microscopic in diameter - typically about one [[micrometre]] across - but may extend to [[macroscopic]] lengths. The longest axons in the human body, for example, are those of the [[sciatic nerve]], which run from the base of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]] to the big toe of each foot. These single-cell fibers may extend a meter or even longer.    

In [[vertebrate]]s, the axons of many neurons are sheathed in [[myelin]], which is formed by either of two types of [[glia|glial cells]]: [[Schwann cell]]s ensheathing [[PNS|peripheral]] neurons and [[oligodendrocyte]]s insulating those of the [[central nervous system]]. Along myelinated nerve fibers, gaps in the sheath known as [[nodes of Ranvier]] occur at evenly-spaced intervals, enabling an especially rapid mode of electrical impulse propagation called [[saltatory conduction|saltation]]. The demyelination of axons is what causes the multitude of neurological symptoms found in the disease [[Multiple Sclerosis]].

The axons of some neurons branch to form [[axon collateral]]s, along which the bifurcated impulse travels simultaneously to signal more than one other cell.

==Growth &amp; Development==
Growing axons move through their environment via the [[growth cone]], which is at the tip of the axon. The growth cone has a broad sheet like extension called [[lamellipodia]] which contain protrusions called [[filopodia]]. The filopodia are the mechanism by which the entire process adheres to surfaces and explores the surrounding environment. [[Actin]] plays a major role in the mobility of this system. 

Environments with high levels of [[cell adhesion molecule]]s or CAM's create an ideal environment for axonal growth. This seems to provide a &quot;sticky&quot; surface for axons to grow along. Examples of CAM's specific to neural systems include [[N-CAM]], neuroglial CAM or [[NgCAM]], [[TAG-1]], [[MAG]], and [[Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide|DCC]], all of which are part of the [[immunoglobulin]] superfamily. Another set of molecules called [[extracellular matrix adhesion molecule]]s also provide a sticky substrate for axons to grow along. Examples of these molecules include [[laminin]], [[fibronectin]], [[tenascin]], and [[perlecan]]. Some of these are surface bound to cells and thus act as short range attractants or repellants. Others are difusible ligands and thus can have long range effects.

Cells called [[guidepost cells]] assist in the guidance of neuronal axon growth. These cells are typically other, sometimes immature, neurons.

==History==
Some of the first intracellular recordings in a nervous system were made in the late 1930's by K. Cole and H. Curtis. [[Alan Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] also employed the [[squid giant axon]] (1939) and by 1952 they had obtained a full quantitative description of the ionic basis of the action potential.
Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded jointly the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] for this work in 1963.

The '''Aramaic alphabet''' is an [[abjad]] alphabet designed for writing the [[Aramaic language]]. As with other abjads, the letters all represent [[consonant]]s; a few [[matres lectionis]] are consonants that also represent long [[vowel]]s.

The earliest inscriptions in the [[Aramaic language]] use the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. In time, the alphabet developed into the form shown below. The use of Aramaic as a [[lingua franca]] throughout the [[Middle East]] from the [[8th century BCE]] led to the gradual adoption of the Aramaic alphabet for writing [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Formerly, Hebrew had been written using an alphabet closer in form to that of [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] (the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]).

The [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] and [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]] alphabets are little changed in style from the Aramaic alphabet. The development of [[cursive]] versions of Aramaic led to the creation of the [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Palmyrenean alphabet|Palmyrenean]] and [[Mandaic alphabet|Mandaic]] alphabets. These scripts formed the basis of the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian]], [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] and [[Mongolian alphabet|Mongolian]] alphabets. Controversially, it is claimed that the Aramaic alphabet may be the forebear of the [[Indic alphabets]].

Today, [[Biblical Aramaic]], Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects and the [[Aramaic language]] of the [[Talmud]] are written in the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Christian Neo-Aramaic dialects are written in the [[Syriac alphabet]]. [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] is written in the [[Mandaic alphabet]].

Redrawn from ''A Grammar of Biblical Aramaic'', Franz Rosenthal; forms are as used in Egypt, [[5th century BCE]].  Names are as in [[Biblical Aramaic]].

[[Vannevar Bush]]'s essay '''''As We May Think''''', first published in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in July [[1945]], argued that as humans turned from war, scientific efforts should shift from increasing physical abilities to making all previous collected [[human]] [[knowledge]] more accessible.

The article was a reworked and expanded version of his 1939 ''Mechanization and the Record''. The system, which he called [[memex]], was described as based on what was thought, at the time, to be the wave of the future: Ultra high resolution [[microfilm]] reels, coupled to multiple screen viewers and cameras, by electromechanical controls. The ''Atlantic Monthly'' article was followed, in November [[1945]], by a [[Life magazine]] article which showed illustrations of the proposed memex desk and automatic typewriter.

''As We May Think'' predicted many kinds of technology invented after its publication, including [[hypertext]], [[personal computers]], the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[speech recognition]], and [[online encyclopedia]]s such as Wikipedia: &quot;Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;'''American shot'''&quot; is a translation of a phrase from [[France|French]] [[film criticism]], &quot;''plan Americain''&quot; and refers to a medium-long (&quot;knee&quot;) [[Shot (film)|film shot]] of a group of characters, who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera. The usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other, with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others. The purpose of the composition is to allow complex [[dialogue]] scenes to be played out without changes in camera position. In some literature, this is simply referred to as a 3/4 shot.

The French critics thought it was characteristic of [[Cinema of the United States|American film]]s of the [[1930s]] or [[1940s]]; however, it was mostly characteristic of ''cheaper'' American movies, such as [[Charlie Chan]] mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago.

'''Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis''' ('''ADEM''') is an immune mediated [[disease]] of [[human brain|brain]]. It usually occurs following a [[virus (biology)|viral]] [[infection]] or [[vaccination]], but it may also appear spontaneously.

There are multiple inflammatory cell deposits in the brain, particularly in the section 
called [[white matter]]. Although it occurs in all ages, most reported cases are in children and [[Adolescence|adolescents]].

It has an abrupt onset and a monophasic course. Symptoms usually begins 1-3 weeks after infection or vaccination. Major symptoms are [[fever]], [[headache]], drowsiness, [[seizure]]s and [[coma]]. Although initially the symptoms are usually mild, later in the course of the disease patients may even die, if they are not treated properly. Some patients recover completely, while others have permanent neurological impairments.

The first treatment is usually [[steroid]]s and [[intensive care]] is often required.

'''Ataxia''' (from [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ''ataxiā'', meaning failure to put in order) is unsteady and clumsy motion of the [[limb]]s or [[torso|trunk]] due to a failure of the gross coordination of [[muscle]] movements.

Ataxia often occurs when parts of the nervous system that control movement are damaged. People with ataxia experience a failure of muscle control in their arms and legs, resulting in a lack of balance and coordination or a disturbance of gait. While the term ataxia is primarily used to describe this set of symptoms, it is sometimes also used to refer to a family of disorders. It is not, however, a specific diagnosis. 

Most disorders that result in ataxia cause cells in the part of the brain called the [[cerebellum]] to degenerate, or atrophy. Sometimes the spine is also affected. The phrases ''cerebellar degeneration'' and ''spinocerebellar degeneration'' are used to describe changes that have taken place in a person’s nervous system; neither term constitutes a specific diagnosis. Cerebellar and spinocerebellar degeneration have many different causes. The age of onset of the resulting ataxia varies depending on the underlying cause of the degeneration. 

Many ataxias are hereditary and are classified by chromosomal location and pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, in which the affected person inherits a normal gene from one parent and a faulty gene from the other parent; and autosomal recessive, in which both parents pass on a copy of the faulty gene. Among the more common inherited ataxias are [[Friedreich's ataxia]] and Machado-Joseph disease. Sporadic ataxias can also occur in families with no prior history. 

Ataxia can also be acquired. Conditions that can cause acquired ataxia include [[stroke]], [[multiple sclerosis]], tumors, [[lesion]]s of the [[central nervous system]] or spinal cord, alcoholism, peripheral neuropathy, metabolic disorders, and vitamin deficiencies. 

[[Dysdiadochokinesia]] is a sign of cerebellar ataxia.

[[University of Minnesota]] researchers suggested in 2006 that [[Abraham Lincoln]] may have suffered from spinocerebellar ataxia type 5, thus accounting for his clumsy gait.[http://www.startribune.com/1244/story/198437.html][http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/01/27/D8FD29HG0.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abdul Alhazred''', or the '''Mad Arab''', is a [[fictional character]] created by the horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. The term &quot;Mad Arab&quot; in reference to Alhazred is always capitalised and used in the manner of an official title such as another person would be called &quot;Prince&quot; or &quot;Sir&quot; and the term can actually be used in lieu of Alhazred's name as a synonym.

''Abdul Alhazred'' is not a real [[Arabic name]], and seems to contain the Arabic definite article morpheme twice in a row (rather anomalous in terms of Arabic grammar).  The more proper Arabic form might be ''Abd-el-Hazred'' or simply ''Abdul Hazred'' (with a single definite article), although these are still anomalous, as ''Hazred'' is not one of the [[99 Names of God]]. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translations, his name has appeared as ''Abdullah Alḥaẓred'' (عبدالله الحظرد). While this Arabic-alphabet spelling of ''Alhazred'' has no real meaning in the Arabic language, it is reminiscent of the verb [[triliteral|root]] ح ظ ر meaning &quot;to forbid.&quot;

According to Lovecraft's &quot;History of the [[Necronomicon]]&quot; (written [[1927]], first published [[1938]]), Alhazred was:

:[A] mad poet of [[Sanaá]], in [[Yemen]], who is said to have flourished during the period of the [[Umayyad | Ommiade]] caliphs, circa [[700]] A.D. He visited the ruins of [[Babylon]] and the subterranean secrets of [[Memphis, Egypt |Memphis]] and spent ten years alone in the great southern desert of [[Arabia]] &amp;mdash; the [[Rub' al Khali|Roba el Khaliyeh]] or &quot;Empty Space&quot; of the ancients &amp;mdash; and &quot;Dahna&quot; or &quot;Crimson&quot; desert of the modern Arabs, which is held to be inhabited by protective evil spirits and monsters of death. Of this desert many strange and unbelievable marvels are told by those who pretend to have penetrated it. In his last years Alhazred dwelt in [[Damascus]].

In [[730]], while still living in Damascus, Alhazred supposedly authored in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] a book of ultimate evil, ''al Azif'', which would later become known as the ''[[Necronomicon]]''.

{{spoiler}}

Those who have any dealings with the Necronomicon usually come to an unpleasant end, and Alhazred was no exception. Again according to Lovecraft:

:Of his final death or disappearance ([[738]] A.D.) many terrible and conflicting things are told. He is said by [[Ibn Khallikan]] ([[13th century]] biographer) to have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright-frozen witnesses. Of his madness many things are told. He claimed to have seen fabulous [[Irem of the Pillars|Irem]], or City of Pillars, and to have found beneath the ruins of a certain [[The Nameless City|nameless desert town]] the shocking annals and secrets of a race older than mankind. He was only an indifferent [[Muslim|Moslem]], worshipping unknown entities whom he called [[Yog-Sothoth]] and [[Cthulhu]].

[[August Derleth]] later made alterations to the biography of Alhazared. One change was redating Alhazared's death to [[731]]. Derleth further wrote on the final fate of Alhazred in his story &quot;[[The Keeper of the Key]]&quot;, first published in May, [[1951]]. In this story [[Dr. Laban Shrewsbury]] (a recurring Derleth character) and his assistant at the time, [[Naylan Colum]], discovered Alhazred's burial site. More specifically they were heading a caravan from [[Salalah]], [[Oman]], and crossed the border into [[Yemen]]. There they found the unexplored desert area the Necronomicon names as &quot;Roba el Ehaliyeh&quot; or &quot;Roba el Khaliyeh&quot; -- perhaps a form of &quot;Rabia al-Awliya&quot; which, again, is not proper Arabic, but could be an allusion to the Sufi Saint Rabia (pure conjecture). More likely it refers the [[Empty Quarter]] or &quot;Rub al Khali&quot;. At the center of the area they discovered [[The Nameless City|the Nameless City]], a domain of [[Hastur]]. Shrewsbury, as an old agent of Hastur and devoted enemy of his half-brother [[Cthulhu]], crossed its gates in search of Alhazred's burial site. He indeed found the gate of Alhazred's burial chamber and learned of his fate. Alhazred was kidnapped in Damascus and brought to the Nameless City, where he had earlier studied and learned some of Necronomicon's secrets. As punishment for his betrayal of their secrets, Alhazred was tortured. Then they blinded him and severed his tongue, and finally executed him. The entrance to the chamber warned against disturbing him. But Shrewbury proceeded in entering the chamber and opening the sarcophagus. Though only rugs, bones and dust remained of Alhazred, the sarcophagus also contained an incomplete personal copy of the Necronomicon, written in the [[Arabic alphabet]]. Then Shrewsbury used [[Necromancy]] to recall Alhazred's spirit and ordered it to draw a map of the world as he knew it. After obtaining the map, which revealed the location of [[R'lyeh]] and other secret places, Shrewsbury finally let Alhazred return to his eternal rest.

==Pop culture==

[[Roberta Williams]] used the name &quot;Abdul Alhazred&quot; as the name of the villain in [[King's Quest 6]].

Marvel comics has also used the name Abdul Alhazred as a supervillian working for Apocalypse.

'''Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace''' ([[December 10]], [[1815]] &amp;ndash; [[November 27]], [[1852]]) is mainly known for having written a description of 
[[Charles Babbage]]'s early mechanical general-purpose computer, the [[analytical engine]].

== Life ==
Ada was the only legitimate child of the poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and his wife, [[Anne Isabella Milbanke|Annabella Milbanke]]. Ada was named after Byron's [[half-sister]], [[Augusta Leigh]], by whom he was rumoured to have fathered a child. It was Augusta who encouraged Byron to marry to avoid scandal, and he reluctantly chose Annabella. On [[January 16]], [[1816]], Annabella left Byron, taking 1-month old Ada with her. On [[April 21]], Byron signed the Deed of Separation and left England for good a few days later. He was never allowed to see either again.

Ada lived with her mother, as is apparent in her father's correspondence concerning her. Lady Byron was also highly interested in mathematics (Lord Byron once called her &quot;the queen of parallelograms&quot;), which dominated her life, even after marriage. Her obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Lord Byron was one of the reasons why Annabella taught Ada [[mathematics]] at an early age. Ada was privately schooled in [[mathematics]] and [[science]], one of her tutors being [[Augustus De Morgan]]. An active member of [[London]] society, she was a member of the [[Bluestockings]] in her youth.

[[Image:Ada Lovelace.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ada Lovelace]]
In 1835 she married [[William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William King, 8th Baron King]], later [[Earl of Lovelace|1st Earl of Lovelace]]. They had three children; Byron born [[12 May]] [[1836]], Annabella ([[Lady Anne Blunt]]) born [[22 September]] [[1837]] and Ralph Gordon born [[2 July]] [[1839]]. The family lived at Ockham Park, at [[Ockham, Surrey]]. Her full name and title for most of her married life was '''The Right Honourable Augusta Ada, Countess of Lovelace'''. She is widely known in modern times simply as '''Ada Lovelace'''.

She knew [[Mary Somerville]], noted researcher and scientific author of the [[19th century]], who introduced her in turn to [[Charles Babbage]] on [[June 5]], [[1833]]. Other acquaintances were [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Michael Faraday]].

During a nine-month period in 1842-1843, Ada translated for Italian mathematician [[Luigi Menabrea]]'s memoir on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|a set of Notes]] which specified in complete detail a method for calculating [[Bernoulli numbers]] with the Engine, recognized by historians as the world's first [[computer program]].  Biographers note, however, that the programs were written by Babbage himself, and Lovelace simply found a mistake in the program for calculating Bernoulli numbers and sent it back for amendment.  The evidence and correspondence between Lovelace and Babbage indicate that he wrote all of the programs in the notes appended to the Menebrea translation.  Her prose acknowledged some possibilities of the machine which Babbage never published, such as speculating that &quot;the Engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.&quot;

Ada Lovelace died at 36 after being [[Bloodletting|bled]] to death by her physicians, who were trying to treat her [[uterine cancer]]. Thus, she died, ironically, not only at the same age as her father did, but even of the same cause - the mistaken custom of bloodletting. She left two sons and a daughter, [[Lady Anne Blunt]], famous in her own right as a traveller in the [[Middle East]] and a breeder of [[Arabian horse]]s.

At her own request, Lovelace was buried next to the father she never knew at the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall|Church of St. Mary Magdalene]] in [[Hucknall]], [[Nottingham]].

== Controversy over attribution ==

Biographers have noted that Lovelace struggled with mathematics, and there is some debate as to whether Lovelace understood deeply the concepts behind programming Babbage's engine, or was more of a figurehead used by Babbage for [[public relations]] purposes.

As an early woman in computing, Lovelace occupies a politically sensitive space in the canon of historical figures in [[computer science]], and therefore the extent of her contribution versus Babbage's remains difficult to assess based on current sources.

== Trivia ==

* On [[December 10]], [[1980]], (Ada's birthday), the [[U.S. Defense Department]] approved the reference manual for their new computer [[programming language]], called &quot;[[Ada programming language|Ada]]&quot;.
* The U.S. [[Defense Standard|Department of Defense Military Standard]] for Ada (MIL-STD-1815) was assigned a number to commemorate the year of her birth.
* On the math-mystery cartoon, ''[[Cyberchase]]'', she appears as the animated character Lady Ada Lovelace, voiced by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' comedian [[Jane Curtin]].  The episode is &quot;Hugs and Witches&quot; (#201) which premiered February 14, 2002 on [[PBS Kids GO!]].
* She is one of the main characters in the [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' by [[Bruce Sterling]] and [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]], which posits a world in which Babbage's machines were [[mass production|mass produced]] and the computer age started a century early.
* ''Lord Byron's Novel'' by [[John Crowley]] is a pastiche of a novel supposedly by Byron (in real life he did begin writing one, but is not known to have completed it), discovered after his death by his daughter, edited and with commentary by her.
* Her image can be seen on the [[Microsoft]] product authenticity [[hologram]] stickers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Computer science|computer science]], the '''ambient calculus''' is a [[Process calculi|process calculus]] devised by [[Luca Cardelli]]
and [[Andrew D. Gordon]] in [[1998]], and used to describe and theorise about [[concurrent systems]] that include ''mobility''. Here ''mobility'' means both computation carried out on mobile devices (''i.e.'' networks that have a dynamic topology), and mobile computation (''i.e.'' executable code that is able to move around the network). The ambient calculus provides a unified framework for modeling both kinds of mobility {{ref_harvard|Cardelli1998|Cardelli 1998|-}}. It is used to model interactions in such [[concurrent systems]] as the [[Internet]].

Since its inception, the ambient calculus has grown into a family of closely related [http://xdguan.freezope.org/wiki/AmbientCalculiOnline ''ambient calculi''].

== Informal description ==
===Ambients===
The fundamental primitive of the ambient calculus is the ''ambient''. An ambient is informally defined as a ''bounded'' place in which computation can occur. The notion of boundaries is considered key to representing mobility, since a boundary defines a contained computational agent that can be moved in its entirety {{ref_harvard|Cardelli1998|Cardelli 1998|-}}. Examples of ambients include: 

* a web page (bounded by a file)
* a virtual address space (bounded by an addressing range)
* a Unix file system (bounded within a physical volume)
* a single data object (bounded by  “self”) 
* a laptop (bounded by its case and data ports)

The key properties of ambients within the Ambient calculus are:

* Ambients have names, which are used to control access to the ambient
* Ambients can be nested inside other ambients (representing, for example, administrative domains)
* Ambients can be moved as a whole

===Operations===
Computation is represented as the crossing of boundaries, ''i.e.'' the movement of ambients. There are three basic operations (or capabilities) on ambients {{ref_harvard|Cardelli1998|Cardelli 1998|-}}:
* &lt;math&gt;in\;m.P&lt;/math&gt; instructs the surrounding ambient to enter some sibling ambient &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, and then proceed as &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;out\;m.P&lt;/math&gt; instructs the surrounding ambient to exit its parent ambient &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;open\;m.P&lt;/math&gt; instructs the surrounding ambient to dissolve the boundary of an ambient &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; located at the same level
The Ambient calculus provides a reduction semantics that formally defines what the results of these operations are.

Communication ''within'' (''i.e.'' local to) an ambient is anonymous and asynchronous. Output actions release names or capabilities into the surrounding ambient. Input actions capture a value from the ambient, and bind it to a variable. ''Non-local'' I/O can be represented in terms of these local communications actions by a variety of means. One approach is to use mobile “messenger” agents that carry a message from one ambient to another (using the capabilities described above). Another approach is to emulate channel-based communications by modeling a channel in terms of ambients and operations on those ambients {{ref_harvard|Cardelli1998|Cardelli 1998|-}}. The three basic ambient primitives, namely '''in''', '''out''', and '''open''' are expressive enough to simulate name-passing channels in the [[Pi-calculus|&amp;pi;-calculus]].

== Criticisms ==
Some people believe that the synchronous nature of the three ambient actions ('''in''', '''out''', and '''open''') may make it difficult to adopt the ambient calculus as the programming language core for mobile and [[distributed computing]]. A counter-argument to this criticism is that the ambient calculus is not intended to act as a language core, but rather to provide general capabilities for formally modelling and analyzing complex concurrent systems that may consist of components written in a variety of languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergefrom|List of works by August Derleth}}

'''August William Derleth''' ([[February 24]] [[1909]] &amp;ndash; [[July 4]] [[1971]]) was an American writer and anthologist. The son of William Julius Derleth and his wife Rose Louise Volk, he resided in [[Sauk City, Wisconsin]].

At the age of 16, he sold his first story to ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine. Derleth wrote all throughout his four years at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and received a [[Bachelor's Degree|B.A.]] in 1930. During this time he served briefly as [[editor]] of ''[[Mystic Magazine]]''.

In the mid-1930s he organised a Ranger's Club for young people, served as clerk and president of the local [[Board of Education]], served as a parole officer, organised a local Men&amp;rsquo;s Club and a [[Parent-Teacher Association|parent-teacher association]]. He also lectured in American Regional Literature at the University of Wisconsin.

Derleth was a contemporary and friend of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] &amp;mdash; when Lovecraft wrote about &quot;le Comte d'Erlette&quot; in [[List of Works by H. P. Lovecraft|his fiction]] it was in homage to Derleth. After Lovecraft's death he took a number of that author's unfinished stories and rewrote or finished them for publication in ''Weird Tales'' and later in book form. In the process, he invented the term [[Cthulhu Mythos]] to describe the invented [[mythology]] that seemed to lie behind much of Lovecraft's fiction. Derleth codified the Mythos to bring it more in line with his own [[Christianity|Christian]] conception of the battle between good and evil and, as other authors had done before him, added new gods and creatures to the stories.

When Lovecraft died in [[1937]], Derleth and [[Donald Wandrei]] put together a collection of that author's [[short story|stories]] and tried to get them published. With existing publishers showing little interest, they founded [[Arkham House]] in 1939 to do it themselves. The name of the company comes from Lovecraft's [[fictional town]] of [[Arkham]], [[Massachusetts]], which featured in many of his stories.

In [[1939]] Arkham House published ''[[The Outsider and Others]]'', a huge collection that contained most of Lovecraft's short stories then known to exist. Derleth and Wandrei soon decided to expand Arkham House and began a regular publishing schedule after its second book, ''[[Someone in the Dark]]'' in [[1941]], a collection of some of Derleth's own [[horror stories]].

In [[1941]] he became literary editor of ''[[The Capital Times]]'' newspaper in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], a post he held until his resignation in [[1960]].

Derleth was married [[April 6]] [[1953]] to Sandra Evelyn Winters, and they were divorced six years later in [[1959]]. He retained custody of their two children, April Rose and Walden William. In [[1960]], Derleth began editing and publishing a magazine called ''Hawk and Whippoorwill'', dedicated to [[poetry|poems]] of man and nature.

He died on [[July 4]] [[1971]] and is buried in [[St. Aloysius]] Cemetery, [[Sauk City]], Wisconsin.

Derleth wrote more than 150 short stories and more than 100 books during his lifetime. Included among that number were several novels about a British detective named [[Solar Pons]], who was quite similar in many respects to [[Sherlock Holmes]]. Derleth, however, lacked the knowledge to make the details of those stories authentic, as he had never been to [[England]]. He also wrote under the [[pseudonym|pseudonyms]] Stephen Grendon, Kenyon Holmes and Tally Mason.

[[Image:Alpenrelief 01.jpg|thumb|275px|Digital relief of the Alps]]

The '''Alps''' (Alpi in Italian) is the name for one of the great [[mountain range]] systems of [[Europe]], stretching from [[Austria]], [[Italy]] and [[Slovenia]] in the east, through [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Germany]] to [[France]] in the west. The word &quot;Alps&quot; was taken via [[French language|French]] from [[Latin]] ''Alpes'' (meaning &quot;the Alps&quot;), which may be influenced by the Latin words ''albus'' (white) or ''altus'' (high), or a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word. 

The highest mountain in the Alps is [[Mont Blanc]] at 4810&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]] on the French-Italian border. All the main peaks of the Alps can be found in the [[list of mountains of the Alps]] and [[list of Alpine peaks by prominence]].

[[Image:Alpenrelief 02.jpg|thumb|275px|the Alps with the Borders of the Countries]]
[[Image:Italian alps1.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The Italian Alps - Taken from an airplane]]
The Alps are generally divided into [[Western Alps]] and [[Eastern Alps]]. The division is along the line between [[Lake Constance]] and [[Lake Como]], following the [[Rhine]]. The Western Alps are located in [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[Switzerland]], the Eastern Alps in [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Switzerland]]. The highest peak of the Western Alps is [[Mont Blanc]], 4810 m. The highest peak in the Eastern Alps is [[Piz Bernina]], 4052 meters.

The Eastern Alps are commonly subdivided according to the different geological composition of the more central parts of the Alps and the groups at its northern and southern fringes: [[Northern Limestone Alps]], [[Central Eastern Alps]] and [[Southern Limestone Alps]]. The border between the [[Central Eastern Alps]] and the [[Southern Limestone Alps]] is the [[Periadriatic Seam]]. The [[Northern Limestone Alps]] are separated from the [[Central Eastern Alps]] by the [[Grauwacken Zone]].

The [[Western Alps]] are commonly subdivided into the following:
*[[Ligurian Alps]]
*[[Maritime Alps]]
*[[Cottian Alps]]
*[[Dauphiné Alps]]
*[[Graian Alps]]
*[[Pennine Alps]]
*[[Bernese Alps]]
*[[Lepontine Alps]]
*[[Glarus Alps]]
*[[North-Eastern Swiss Alps]]

Series of lower mountain ranges run parallel to the main chains of the Alps, including the [[French Prealps]].

:''Main article: [[Main chain of the Alps]]''

[[Image:alps.space.300pix.jpg|thumb|right|The European Alps from space in May 2002.]]
The &quot;main chain of the Alps&quot; follows the watershed from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Wienerwald]], passing over many of the highest and most famous peaks in the Alps. From the Colle di Cadibona to [[Col de Tende]] it runs westwards, before turning to the north-west and then, near the [[Colle della Maddalena]], to the north. Upon reaching the Swiss border, the line of the main chain heads approximately east-north-east, a heading it follows until its end near [[Vienna]].

===Principal passes===
:''Main article: [[Principal passes of the Alps]]''

The Alps do not form an impassable barrier; they have been traversed for [[war]] and [[commerce]], and later by [[pilgrim]]s, [[student]]s and [[tourist]]s. Crossing places by [[road]], [[train]] or foot are called passes, these are depressions in the  mountains to which a valley leads from the plains and hilly pre-mountainous zones.

==Climate==
:''Main article: [[Climate of the Alps]]''

The ''climate of the Alps'' is the [[climate]], or average [[weather]] conditions over a long time, of the central Alpine region of [[Europe]]. As we rise from [[sea level]] into the upper regions of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the [[temperature]] [[adiabatic lapse rate|decreases]]. The effect of [[mountain]] chains on prevailing [[wind]]s is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in [[volume]] at the cost of a proportionate loss of [[heat]], often accompanied by the [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of moisture in the form of [[snow]] or [[rain]].

==Geology==
:''Main article: [[Geology of the Alps]]''

The Alps arose as a result of the pressure exerted on [[sediment]]s of the [[Tethys Ocean]] basin as its [[Mesozoic]] and early [[Cenozoic]] [[Stratum|strata]] were pushed against the stable [[Eurasia]]n landmass by the northward-moving [[Africa]]n landmass. Most of this occurred during the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] epochs. The pressure formed great recumbent folds, or ''nappes'', that rose out of what had become the [[Tethys Sea]] and pushed northward, often breaking and sliding one over the other to form gigantic thrust [[Geologic fault|fault]]s. [[Crystal]]line rocks, which are exposed in the higher central regions, are the rocks forming [[Mont Blanc]], the [[Matterhorn]], and high peaks in the Pennine Alps and Hohe Tauern.

The landscape seen today is mostly formed by [[glaciation]] during the past two million years. At least five [[ice age]]s have done much to remodel the region, scooping out the lakes and rounding off the limestone hills along the northern border. [[Glaciers]] have been retreating during the past 10,000 years, leaving large granite boulders scattered in the forests in the region.  As the last ice age ended, it is believed that the [[climate]] changed so rapidly that the glaciers retreated back into the mountains in a span of about 200 to 300 years.

==Political history==
:''Main article: [[Political history and modern state of the inhabitants of the Alps]]''

Little is known of the early dwellers in the Alps, save from the scanty accounts preserved  by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historian]]s and [[geographer]]s.  A few details have come down to us of the conquest of many of the Alpine tribes by [[Augustus]].

The successive emigration and occupation of the Alpine region by various [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic tribes]] from the [[5th century|5th]] to the [[6th century|6th centuries]] are known only in outline, because to them, as to the [[Frankish]] kings and emperors, the Alps offered a route from one place to another rather than a permanent residence.

It is not until the final breakup of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the [[10th century|10th]] and [[11th century|11th centuries]] that it becomes possible to trace out the local history of the Alps.

==Exploration==
:''Main article: [[Exploration of the High Alps]]''

The higher regions of the Alps were long left to the exclusive attention of the men of the adjoining valleys, even when Alpine travellers (as distinguished from Alpine climbers) began to visit these valleys. The two men who first explored the regions of ice and snow were H.B. de Saussure (1740-1799) in the [[Pennine Alps]], and the Benedictine monk of [[Disentis]], Placidus a Spescha (1752-1833), most of whose ascents were made before 1806, in the valleys at the sources of the [[Rhine]].

==Flora==
A natural vegetation limit with altitude is given by the presence of the chief [[deciduous]] [[tree]]s &amp;mdash; [[oak]], [[beech]], [[Ash tree|ash]] and [[sycamore maple]].  These do not reach exactly to the same elevation, nor are they often found growing together; but their upper limit corresponds accurately enough to the change from a temperate to a colder climate that is further proved by a change in the wild [[herb]]aceous vegetation.  This limit usually lies about 1200 m above the sea on the north side of the Alps, but on the southern slopes it often rises to 1500 m, sometimes even to 1700 m.

It must not be supposed that this region is always marked by the presence of the characteristic trees. The interference of man has in many districts almost removed them, and, excepting the beech forests of the [[Austria]]n Alps, a considerable wood of deciduous trees is rare. In many districts where such woods once existed, their place has been occupied by the [[Scots pine]] and [[Norway spruce]], which suffer less from the ravages of goats, the worst enemies of tree vegetation. The mean annual temperature of this region differs little from that of the [[British Islands]]; but the climate conditions are widely different. Here snow usually lies for several months, till it gives place to a spring and summer considerably warmer than the average of British seasons.

'''Albert Camus''' (pronounced Kam-oo, [[IPA]]: ka.mʉ̟ː) ([[November 7]], [[1913]] &amp;ndash; [[January 4]], [[1960]]) was a  [[France|French]] [[author]] and [[philosopher]] and one of the principal luminaries (with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]) of [[absurdism]].  Camus was the second youngest-ever recipient of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] (after [[Rudyard Kipling]]) when he received the award in 1957. He is also the [[List of Nobel Prize in Literature winners by longevity|shortest-lived of any literature laureate]] to date, having died in a car crash three years after receiving the award.

==Early years== 
Albert Camus was born in [[Mondovi, Algeria]] to a French Algerian ([[pied noir]]) settler family. His mother was of Spanish extraction. His father, Lucien, died in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in [[1914]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], while serving as a member of the [[Zouave]] infantry regiment. Camus lived in poor conditions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of [[Algiers]].

In [[1923]], Camus was accepted into the [[lycée]] and eventually to the [[University of Algiers]]. However, he contracted [[tuberculosis]] in [[1930]], which put an end to his [[football (soccer)|football]] activities (he had been a [[goalkeeper]] for the university team) and forced him to make his studies a part-time pursuit. He took odd jobs including private [[tutor]], car parts clerk, and work for the Meteorological Institute. He completed his ''licence de philosophie'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) in [[1935]]; in May of [[1936]], he successfully presented his thesis on [[Plotinus]], ''Néo-Platonisme et Pensée Chrétienne'' for his ''diplôme d'études supérieures'' (roughly equivalent to an M.A. by thesis). 
{{French literature (small)}}
Camus joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1934, apparently for concern over the political situation in [[Spain]] (which eventually resulted in the [[Spanish Civil War]]) rather than support for [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] doctrine. In 1936, the independence-minded Algerian Communist Party (PCA) was founded. Camus joined the activities of [[Le Parti du Peuple Algérien]], which got him into trouble with his communist party comrades.  As a result, he was denounced as &quot;[[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]]&quot;, which did not endear him to Stalinist communism. 

In 1934, he [[Married|married]] Simone Hie, a [[morphine]] addict, but the marriage ended due to Simone's infidelity. In 1935, he founded ''Théâtre du Travail'' &amp;mdash; &quot;Worker's Theatre&quot; &amp;mdash; (renamed ''Théâtre de l'Equipe'' (&quot;Team's Theatre&quot;) in [[1937]]), which survived until 1939. From 1937 to 1939, he wrote for a socialist paper, ''Alger-Republicain'', and his work included an account of the peasants who lived in [[Kabylie]] in poor conditions, which apparently cost him his job. From 1939 to 1940, he briefly wrote for a similar paper, ''Soir-Republicain''. He was rejected from the French army because of his [[tuberculosis]].

In 1940, Camus married Francine Faure, a pianist and mathematician. Francine gave birth to twins Catherine and Jean Camus on September 5th, 1945. Also in this year, Camus began to work for ''[[Paris-Soir]]'' magazine. In the first stage of [[World War II]], the so-called [[Phony War]] stage, Camus was a [[pacifism|pacifist]]. However, he was in [[Paris]] to witness how the [[Wehrmacht]] took over. On [[December 15]], [[1941]], Camus witnessed the execution of [[Gabriel Peri]], an event which Camus later said crystallized his revolt against the Germans. Afterwards he moved to [[Bordeaux]] alongside the rest of the staff of ''Paris-Soir''. In this year he finished his first books, ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. He returned briefly to [[Oran]], Algeria in 1942.

== Literary career ==
During the war Camus joined the [[French Resistance]] cell ''Combat'', which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the [[moniker]] &quot;Beauchard&quot;. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943, and when the Allies liberated Paris Camus reported on the last of the fighting. He eventually resigned from ''Combat'' in 1947, when it became a commercial paper. It was here that he became acquainted with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

[[Image:camus-albert.jpg|thumb|right|Albert Camus]]
After the war, Camus became one member of Sartre's entourage and frequented ''[[Café de Flore]]'' on the [[Boulevard St. Germain]] in [[Paris]]. Camus also toured the [[United States]] to lecture about French existentialism. Although he leaned [[left-wing politics|left]] politically, his strong criticisms of communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the communist parties and eventually also alienated Sartre. 

In 1949 his tuberculosis returned and he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951 he published ''[[The Rebel]]'', a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which made clear his rejection of communism. The book upset many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France and led to the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed him and he began instead to translate plays. 

Camus's most significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd, the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he explained in ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' and incorporated into many of his other works, such as ''[[The Plague]]''. Some would argue that Camus is better described not as an [[existentialist]] (a label he would have rejected) but as an [[absurdist]].

In the 1950s Camus devoted his efforts to [[human rights]]. In 1952 he resigned from his work for [[UNESCO]] when the [[UN]] accepted [[Spain]] as a member under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]. In 1953 he was one of the few leftists who criticized [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] methods to crush a worker's strike in [[East Berlin]]. In 1956 he protested similar methods in [[Hungary]]. 

He maintained his pacifism and resistance to [[capital punishment]] everywhere in the world. One of his most significant contributions was an essay collaboration with [[Arthur Koestler|Koestler]], the writer, intellectual, and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment.

When the [[Algerian War of Independence]] began in 1954 it presented a moral dilemma for Camus. He identified with [[pied-noir]]s, and defended the French government on the grounds that revolt of its North African colony was really an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States' (Actuelles III: Chroniques Algeriennes, 1939-1958). Although favouring greater Algerian [[self-governance|autonomy]] or even [[federation]], though not full-scale independence, he believed that the pied-noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work clandestinely for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. 

From 1955 to 1956 Camus wrote for [[L'Express]]. In [[1957]] he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]], officially not for his novel ''[[The Fall]]'', published the previous year, but for his writings against capital punishment in the essay &quot;Réflexions Sur la Guillotine&quot;. When he spoke to students at the [[University of Stockholm]], he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question and stated that he was worried what could happen to his mother who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals.

Camus died on [[January 4]], [[1960]] in a car accident near [[Sens]], in a place named &quot;Le Grand Frossard&quot; in the small town of Villeblevin.  Ironically, Camus had uttered a remark earlier in his life that the most absurd way to die would be in a car accident.

The plaque says: &quot;From the Yonne area's local council, in tribute to the writer Albert Camus who was watched over in the Villeblevin town hall in the night of the 4th to the 5th of January 1960&quot;]]
The driver of the [[Facel Vega]], [[Michel Gallimard]] -- his publisher and close friend -- also perished in the accident. Camus was interred in the Lourmarin Cemetery, [[Lourmarin]], [[Vaucluse]], [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]], [[France]]. 

He was survived by his twin children, Catherine and Jean, who hold the copyrights to his work.

After his death, two of Camus's works were published posthumously.  The first was an earlier version of ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' entitled ''[[A Happy Death]]'' and was published in [[1970]].  The second work was an unfinished novel, ''[[The First Man]]'', that Camus was writing before he died.  The novel was an [[autobiographical]] work about his childhood in [[Algeria]] and was published in [[1995]].

==Summary of Absurdism==
[[Image:20041113-002 Lourmarin Tombstone Albert Camus.jpg|thumb|Albert Camus' gravestone]]
Many writers have written on the Absurd, each with his or her own interpretation of what the Absurd actually is and their own ideas on the importance of the Absurd. For example, Sartre does little more than acknowledge it while Kierkegaard bases the existence of the God on the fact of the absurd. Camus was not the originator of Absurdism and regretted the continued reference to him as a ''philosopher of the absurd''. He shows less and less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (The Myth of Sisyphus). To distinguish Camus's ideas of the Absurd from those of other philosophers, people sometimes refer to the '''Paradox of the Absurd''', when referring to ''Camus's Absurd''.

His early thoughts on the Absurd appeared in his first collection of essays, ''L'Envers et l'endroit'' (The Wrong Side and the Right Side) in 1937. Absurd themes appeared with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, ''Noces'' (Nuptials), in 1938. In these essays Camus does not offer a philosophical account of the Absurd, or even a definition; rather he reflects on the experience of the Absurd. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an Absurd life as ''L'Étranger'' (The Stranger/Outsider), and in the same year releases ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (The Myth of Sisyphus), a literary essay on the Absurd. He had also written a play about a Roman Emperor, Caligula, pursuing an Absurd logic. However, the play was not performed until 1945. The turning point in Camus's attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of letters to a fictitious German friend, published in the newspaper ''Combat''.

===Camus' ideas on the Absurd===
In the essays Camus presented us with dualisms; happiness and sadness, dark and light, life and death, etc. He wanted us to face up to the fact that happiness is fleeting and that we will die. He did this not to be morbid, but so we can love life and enjoy our happiness when it occurs. In ''Le Myth'', this dualism became a paradox; we value our lives and existence so greatly, but at the same time we know we will eventually die, and ultimately our endeavours are meaningless. Whilst we can live with a dualism (''I can accept periods of unhappiness, because I know I will also experience happiness to come''), we cannot live with the paradox (''I think my life is of great importance, but I also think it is meaningless''). In ''Le Myth'', Camus was interested in how we experience the Absurd and how we live with it. Our life must have meaning for us to value it. If we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value, should we kill ourselves?

Meursault, the Absurdist hero of ''L'Étranger'', is a murderer who is executed for his crimes. Caligula ends up admitting his Absurd logic was wrong and is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about. However, Camus, while obviously suggesting that Caligula's Absurd reasoning is wrong, exalts Meursault as the only Messiah we deserve. ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' raises questions it cannot satisfactorily answer. 

Camus' work on the Absurd was intended to promote a public debate. His various offerings entice us to think about the Absurd and offer our own contribution. Concepts such as cooperation, joint effort and solidarity are of key importance to Camus. In the essay ''Enigma'', Camus expressed his frustration at being labeled a philosopher of the absurd. None of his previous work was intended to be a definitive account of his thoughts on the Absurd, although the ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' is often mistaken as such. 

Camus made a significant contribution to our understanding of the Absurd, but was not himself an Absurdist. &quot;If nothing had any meaning, you would be right. But there is something that still has a meaning.&quot; ''Second Letter to a German Friend'', December 1943.

'''Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie''', [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] ([[September 15]], [[1890]] &amp;ndash; [[January 12]], [[1976]]), was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[crime fiction]] writer. She also wrote romances under the name '''Mary Westmacott'''.

Agatha Christie is the world's best-known mystery writer and, apart from [[William Shakespeare]], is the all-time best-selling author of any genre. Her books have sold over two billion copies in the [[English language]] and another billion in over 45 foreign languages (as of 2003). As an example of her broad appeal, she is the all-time best-selling author in France, with over 40 million copies sold in [[French language|French]] (as of 2003) versus 22 million for [[Émile Zola]], the nearest contender. She is famously known as the 'Queen of Crime' and is, arguably, the most important and innovative writer in the development of the English mystery novel.

Her [[Play|stage play]] ''[[The Mousetrap]]'' holds the record for the longest run ever in London, opening at the Ambassadors Theatre on [[November 25]], [[1952]], and as of 2006 is still running after more than 20,000 performances.

Christie published over eighty novels and stageplays, mainly [[Whodunit|whodunnit]]s and [[locked room mystery|locked room mysteries]], many of these featuring one of her main series characters, [[Hercule Poirot]] or [[Miss Marple]]. Although she delighted in twisting the established [[detective fiction]] form - one of her early books, ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', is renowned for its surprise denouement - she was scrupulous in &quot;playing fair&quot; with the reader by making sure information for solving the [[puzzle]] was given. 

Most of her books and [[short story|short stories]] have been filmed, some many times over (''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', ''[[Death on the Nile]]'', ''[[4.50 From Paddington|4.50 from Paddington]]''). The [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] has produced television and radio versions of most of the Poirot and Marple stories. A later series of Poirot dramatizations starring [[David Suchet]] was made by [[Granada Television]]. In 2004, the Japanese broadcasting company [[NHK|Nippon Housou Kyoukai]] turned Poirot and Marple into animated characters in the [[anime]] series ''[[Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple]]'', introducing Mabel West (daughter of Miss Marple's mystery-writer nephew Raymond West, a [[canon (fiction)|canon]]ical Christie character) and her duck Oliver as new characters.

==Biography==
[[Image:Agatha Christie plaque, Torre Abbey.jpg|thumb|A plaque from the Agatha Christie Mile at [[Torre Abbey]] in [[Torquay]].]]

Christened '''Agatha May Clarissa Miller''', in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]], [[England]], she was the daughter of a [[United States]]-born father and a British mother. (However, she never held U.S. citizenship.)

Christie's first marriage, an unhappy one, was in 1914 to Colonel Archibald Christie, an aviator in the [[Royal Flying Corps]]. The couple had one daughter, [[Rosalind Hicks]], and divorced in 1928. 

During [[World War I]] she worked at a hospital and then a pharmacy, a job that also influenced her work: many of the murders in her books are carried out with [[poison]].

In December 1926 she disappeared for eleven days, causing quite a storm in the press. Her car was found abandoned in a chalk pit. She was eventually found staying at a hotel in [[Harrogate]], where she claimed to have suffered [[amnesia]] due to a [[nervous breakdown]] following the death of her mother and her husband's confessed infidelity. Opinions are still divided as to whether this was a [[publicity stunt]] or not. A 1979 film, ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'', starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Christie, recounted a fictionalised version of the disappearance.

In 1930, Christie married (despite her divorce) a Roman Catholic, Sir [[Max Mallowan]], a British [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] 14 years her junior, and her travels with him contributed background to several of her novels set in the [[Middle East]]. Other novels (such as [[And Then There Were None]]) were set in and around [[Torquay]], [[Devon]], where she was born. 

In 1971 she was granted the title of [[Order of the British Empire|Dame Commander of the British Empire]].

Agatha Christie died on [[January 12]], [[1976]], at age 85 from natural causes, at [[Winterbrook House]], [[Cholsey]] near [[Wallingford]], [[Oxfordshire]]. She is buried at St. Mary's Churchyard in Cholsey, Oxon. 

Christie's only child, [[Rosalind Hicks]], died on [[October 28]], [[2004]], also aged 85, from natural causes. Christie's grandson, Matthew Prichard, now owns the royalties to his grandmother's works.

{{spoiler}}

Two of her novels were written at the height of her career but held back until after her death: they were the last cases of Poirot and Miss Marple. In the final Poirot novel ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]'', Christie killed her creation and explained in her diary that she had always found him insufferable. She had a great fondness for Miss Marple, who was based largely on Christie's own grandmother, so she allowed Miss Marple to solve one more mystery in ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' and return to the solitude of her village. However, since ''Sleeping Murder'' had been written quite a while previously, at least one character (Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Jane Marple's friend, Dolly) who had been declared deceased in earlier-released mysteries reappeared alive and well.

'''''The Plague''''' (''[[French language|fr]].'' '''''La Peste''''') is a [[novel]] by [[Albert Camus]], published in [[1947]], that tells the story of medical workers finding solidarity in their labor as the [[Algeria|Algerian]] city of [[Oran]] is swept by a [[pandemic|plague]]. It asks a number of questions relating to the nature of destiny and the human condition. The characters in the book, ranging from doctors to vacationers to fugitives, all help to show the effects the plague has on a populace.

{{spoiler}}

Generally taken as a metaphoric treatment of the [[French resistance]] to [[Nazi]] occupation during [[World War II]], ''The Plague'' is interpreted to mean much more. Camus uses extreme hardships (e.g., pain, suffering, and death) to represent our human world. The story is told through the narrative of the main character, Dr. Rieux, whose decidedly existential account of events in the story is not only helpful in exploring the philosophy of existentialism, but also in making this a metaphor of the nature of life and suffering. Although his approach in the book is severe, he emphasizes the ideas that we ultimately have no control, irrationality of life is inevitable, and he further illustrates the human reaction towards the ‘absurd’. ''The Plague'' represents how the world deals with the philosophical notion of the [[Absurdism|Absurd]], a theory which Camus himself helped to define.

==Main Characters==
*Dr. Bernard Rieux
*Jean Tarrou -- a man vacationing in Oran

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Applied ethics''' takes a theory of [[ethics]], such as [[utilitarianism]], [[social contract theory]], or [[deontology]], and applies its major principles to a particular set of circumstances and practices.  Typical examples include applied fields such as [[medical ethics]], [[legal ethics]], [[environmental ethics]], [[computer ethics]], [[corporate social responsibility]], or [[business ethics]]. Many considerations of applied ethics also come into play in [[human rights]] discussions.

The chief difficulty with formal, applied ethics is the potential for disagreement over what constitutes the proper theory or principles to apply, which is bound to result in solutions to specific problems that are not universally acceptable to all participants.  For example, a strict deontological approach would never permit us to deceive a patient about his condition, whereas a utilitarian approach would have us consider the consequences of doing so.  A deontologist will often come up with a very different solution than would a utilitarian, given the same facts.  

One modern approach attempting to address this is [[casuistry]].  Casuistry attempts to establish a plan of action to respond to particular facts - a form of [[case-based reasoning]].  By doing so in advance of actual investigation of the facts, it can reduce influence of interest groups.  By focusing on action and not the rationale, it increases the possibility of agreement between prior bodies of precedent and explicit moral codes.

'''Adolf Otto Eichmann''' ([[March 19]], [[1906]] &amp;ndash; [[June 1]], [[1962]]), born '''Karl Adolf Eichmann''', was a high-ranking official in [[Nazi Germany]] and served as an ''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' in the [[Schutzstaffel|S.S.]] He was largely responsible for the logistics of the extermination of millions of people during [[the Holocaust]], in particular [[Jew]]s, which was called the &quot;[[final solution]]&quot; (''Endlösung''). He organized the identification and transportation of people to the various [[concentration camp]]s.  Therefore, he is often referred to as the 'Chief Executioner' of the [[Third Reich]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Solingen]], [[Germany]], Adolf Eichmann was the son of a moderately successful businessman and industrialist. In 1914, his family moved to [[Linz]], [[Austria]], and during the [[World War I|First World War]], Eichmann's father served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]].  At the war's conclusion, Eichmann's father returned to the family business in Linz.  In 1920, Eichmann's family moved to Germany.

==Pre-Nazi years==
[[Image:YoungEichmann.jpg|left|thumb|125px|Adolf Eichmann in 1932]]

When Eichmann came of age in 1925, he returned to Austria to study mechanical engineering. Being a poor student, however, he soon dropped out of college. Eichmann then tried to follow in his father's footsteps in business, working as a travelling salesman which brought him back to Germany in 1930. 

Eichmann's first contact with the [[Nazi Party]] was when he joined the [[Wandervogel]] movement, which has been described as &quot;a peasant Aryan brotherhood based on Anti-Semitic ideals&quot;.  There is evidence, however, that some of the ''Wandervogel'' groups had Jewish members, and anti-Semitism may have existed in only some parts of the movement.  In 1932, Eichmann returned again to Austria and formally joined the Austrian Nazi Party at the age of twenty-six.

==Nazi Party and the SS==
[[Image:SSEichmann.jpg|thumb|125px|SS-[[Scharführer]] Adolf Eichmann in 1933]]

On the advice of old family friend [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], Eichmann joined the Austrian branch of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], enlisting on [[April 1]] [[1932]], as an ''SS-[[Anwärter]]''.  He was accepted as a full SS member that November, appointed an ''SS-[[Mann (military rank)|Mann]]'', and assigned the SS number 45326. 

For the next year, Eichmann was a member of the part time [[Allgemeine-SS]] and served in a mustering formation operating from Salzburg. 

In 1933 when the Nazis came to power in Germany, Eichmann returned to that country and submitted an application to join the full time SS. This was accepted, and in November of 1933, Eichmann was promoted to ''[[Scharführer]]'' and assigned to the administrative staff of the [[Dachau concentration camp]].   

By 1934, Eichmann had chosen to make the SS a career and requested transfer into the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (Security Police) which had, by that time, become a very powerful and feared organization. Eichmann's transfer was granted in November of 1934, as he was promoted to the rank of ''[[Oberscharführer]]'' and assigned to the headquarters of the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) in Berlin. Eichmann became a model administrator in the SD and quickly became noticed by his superiors.  He was promoted to ''[[Hauptscharführer]]'' in 1935 and, in 1937, commissioned as an ''SS-[[Untersturmführer]]''.

In 1937 Eichmann was sent to [[British mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] with his superior [[Herbert Hagen]] to assess the possibilities of massive Jewish emigration from Germany to Palestine. They landed in [[Haifa]] but could only obtain a transit visa so they went on to [[Cairo]]. In Cairo they met [[Feival Polkes]], an agent of the [[Haganah]], who discussed with them the plans of the Zionists and tried to enlist their assistance in facilitating Jewish emigration from Europe. According to an  answer Eichmann gave at his trial, he had also planned to meet Arab leaders in Palestine; this never happened because entry to Palestine was refused by the British authorities. Afterwards Eichmann and Hagen wrote a report recommending against large-scale emigration to Palestine for economic reasons and because it contradicted the German policy of preventing the establishment of a Jewish state there. This episode is sometimes seen as an important step towards the Nazi abandonment of emigration as the preferred &quot;solution to the Jewish problem&quot;. 

In 1938, Eichmann was assigned to Austria to help organize SS Security Forces in Vienna after the [[Anschluss]] of Austria into Germany. Through this effort, Eichmann was promoted to ''SS-[[Obersturmführer]]'', and by the end of 1938, Adolf Eichmann had been selected by the SS leadership to form the [[Central Office for Jewish Emigration]], which was in charge of forcibly deporting and expelling Jews from Austria.  Through this work, Eichmann became a student of Judaism, finding the religion fascinating while also developing deep [[Anti-Semitic]] values and a hatred of the Jewish faith.

==World War II==
[[Image:Eichmann1942.jpg|right|thumb|145px|Adolf Eichmann in 1942]]

At the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Eichmann had been promoted to ''SS-[[Hauptsturmführer]]'' and had made a name for himself with his Office for Jewish Emigration.  Through this work Eichmann made several contacts in the [[Zionist]] movement which he worked with to speed up Jewish Emigration from the Reich. 

Eichmann returned to Berlin in 1939 after the formation of the Reich Central Security Office ([[RSHA]]).  In December 1939, he was assigned to head ''RSHA Referat IV D4'', the RSHA department that dealt with Jewish affairs and evacuation.  In August 1940, he released his ''[[Madagascar Plan|Reichssicherheitshauptamt: Madagaskar Projekt]]'' (Reich Central Security Office: Madagascar Project), a plan for forced Jewish deportation that never materialized.  He was promoted to the rank of ''SS-[[Sturmbannführer]]'' in late [[1940]], and less than a year later to ''[[Obersturmbannführer]]''.

In 1942, [[Reinhard Heydrich]] invited Eichmann to attend the [[Wannsee Conference]] where Germany's anti-Jewish measures were set down into an official policy of [[genocide]]. To this &quot;Final Solution of the Jewish Question&quot; Eichmann was tasked as &quot;Transportation Administrator&quot;, which put him in charge of all the trains which would carry Jews to the Death Camps in [[Poland]]. For the next two years, Eichmann performed his duties with incredible zeal, often bragging that he had personally sent over five million Jews to their deaths by way of his trains. 

Eichmann's work had been noticed, and in [[1944]], he was sent to [[Hungary]] after Germany had occupied that country in fear of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion. Eichmann at once went to work deporting Jews and was able to send four hundred thousand Hungarians to their deaths in the Nazi gas chambers. 

By [[1945]], Eichmann's world was collapsing, as Reich Leader [[Heinrich Himmler]] had ordered that Jewish extermination be halted and evidence of the Final Solution be destroyed. Eichmann blatantly turned against Himmler and continued his work in Hungary against official orders. Eichmann was also working to avoid being called up in the last ditch German military effort, since a year before he had been commissioned as a Reserve ''Untersturmführer'' in the [[Waffen-SS]] and was now being ordered to active combat duty. 

Eichmann fled Hungary in 1945 as the Russians invaded, and he returned to Austria where he met up with his old friend [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]]. Kaltenbrunner, however, refused to associate with Eichmann since Eichmann's duties as an extermination administrator had left him a marked man by the Allies.

==Post World War II==
At the end of World War II, Eichmann was captured by the US Army, who did not know that this man who presented himself as &quot;Otto Eckmann&quot; was in fact a much bigger fish.  Early in 1946, he escaped from US custody and hid in various parts of Germany for a few years.  In 1948 he obtained a landing permit for [[Argentina]], but did not seek to use it immediately.  At the beginning of 1950, Eichmann went to [[Italy]], where he posed as a refugee named Ricardo Klement.  With the help of a Franciscan monk who had connections with archbishop [[Alois Hudal]], Eichmann obtained an [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] humanitarian passport and an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] visa.  He arrived by ship in Argentina on [[July 14]],  [[1950]].  For the next ten years, he worked in several odd jobs in the [[Buenos Aires]] area (from factory foreman, to junior water engineer and professional rabbit farmer). Eichmann also brought his family to Argentina. Argentina at the time was a haven for many Nazis.

==Capture==
[[Image:Adold Eichmann.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Adolf Eichmann during his 1961 trial in Jerusalem.]]
Throughout the 1950s many Jews and other victims of the Holocaust dedicated themselves to finding Eichmann and other Nazi [[war crimes|war criminals]]. Among them was [[Nazi hunter]] [[Simon Wiesenthal]]. In 1954, Wiesenthal's suspicions that Eichmann was in Argentina were sparked upon receiving a postcard from an associate who had moved to [[Buenos Aires]]. &quot;I saw that dirty pig Eichmann,&quot; the letter read in part, &quot;He lives near Buenos Aires and works for a water company&quot;. With this (and other) information collected by Wiesenthal, the [[Israel]]is had solid leads regarding Eichmann's whereabouts. [[Isser Harel]], the then-head of [[Mossad]] (Israeli intelligence agency), later claimed in an unpublished manuscript that Wiesenthal &quot;'had no role whatsoever' in Eichmann's apprehension but in fact had endangered the entire Eichmann operation and aborted the planned capture of Auschwitz doctor [[Josef Mengele]].&quot; (Schachter, Jonathan &quot;Isser Harel Takes On Nazi-Hunter. Wiesenthal 'Had No Role' In Eichmann Kidnapping.&quot; The Jerusalem Post [[7 May]] [[1991]])

Also instrumental in exposing Eichmann's identity was [[Lothar Hermann]], a worker of Jewish descent who fled to Argentina from Germany following his incarceration in the [[Dachau concentration camp]], where Eichmann had served as an administrator. By the 1950s, Hermann had settled into life in Buenos Aires with his family; daughter Sylvia became acquainted with the Eichmann family and romantically involved with Klaus, the oldest Eichmann son. Due to Klaus's boastful remarks about his father's life as a Nazi and direct responsibility for the [[Holocaust]], Hermann knew he had struck gold in 1957 after reading a newspaper report about German war criminals - of which Eichmann was one. Soon after, he sent Sylvia to the Eichmanns' home on a fact-finding mission. She was met at the door by Eichmann himself, and after unsuccessfully asking for Klaus, she inquired as to whether she was speaking to his father. Eichmann confirmed this fact. Excited, Hermann soon began a correspondence with [[Fritz Bauer]], chief [[prosecutor]] for the [[West Germany|West German]] state of [[Hesse]], and provided details about Eichmann's person and life. Bauer knew that Germany, served by former employees of the Nazi regime, would do little to serve justice to Eichmann. He contacted Israeli officials, who worked closely with Hermann over the next several years to learn about Eichmann and to formulate a plan to capture him.

In 1960, the [[Mossad]] discovered that Eichmann was in [[Argentina]] and began an effort to locate his exact whereabouts when, through relentless surveillance, it was confirmed that Ricardo Klement was, in fact, Adolf Eichmann. The Israeli government then approved an operation to capture Eichmann and bring him to [[Jerusalem]] for trial as a war criminal. He was captured by a team of Mossad agents on [[May 11]], [[1960]], as part of a [[covert operation]]. He was flown aboard an [[El Al]] airliner from Argentina to [[Israel]] on [[May 21]], [[1960]]. 

For some time the Israeli government denied involvement in Eichmann's capture, claiming that he had been taken by Jewish volunteers. Eventually, however, the pretense was dropped, and then prime minister [[David Ben Gurion]] announced Eichmann's capture to the [[Knesset]] (Israel's national legislature) on [[May 23]] [[1960]], receiving a standing ovation in return. [[Isser Harel]], head of the Mossad at the time of the operation, wrote a book about Eichmann's capture entitled ''The House on Garibaldi Street''; some years later a member of the capture team, [[Peter Malkin]], authored ''Eichmann in my Hands'', a book that contains fascinating insights into Eichmann's character and motivations, but whose veracity has been attacked.

==Trial==
[[Image:Eichmann_trial_1961_in_glass_box.jpg|right|thumb|Eichmann and a bulletproof glass booth during the open trial.]]

Eichmann's trial in front of an Israeli court in [[Jerusalem]] started on [[April 11]], [[1961]]. He was indicted on 15 criminal charges, including charges of [[crimes against humanity]], crimes against the Jewish people and membership of an outlawed organization. As in Israeli criminal procedure, his trial was presided over by three judges. [[Gideon Hausner]], the Israeli attorney general, personally acted as chief prosecutor. 

The trial caused huge international controversy as well as an international sensation. The Israeli government allowed news programs all over the world to broadcast the trial live with few restrictions. [[Television]] viewers saw a nondescript man sitting in a [[bulletproof glass]] booth while witnesses, including many [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors, testified against him and his role in transporting victims to the extermination camps. During the whole trial, Eichmann insisted that he was only &quot;following orders&quot; - the same defense used by the Nazi war criminals during the 1945-1946 [[Nuremberg Trials]]. He explicitly declared that he had abdicated his [[consciousness]] in order to follow the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''. This defense in turn promoted the [[Milgram experiment]]. 

After 14 weeks of testimony with more than 1,500 documents, 100 prosecution witnesses (90 of whom were Nazi concentration camp survivors) and dozens of defense depositions delivered by diplomatic couriers from 16 different countries, the Eichmann trial ended on [[August 14]], [[1961]] where the judges were then left to deliberate. On [[December 11]] the three judges announced their verdict where Eichmann was convicted on all counts. He was then sentenced to death on [[December 15]], [[1961]]. Eichmann appealed the verdict, mostly relying on legal arguments about Israel's jurisdiction and the legality of the laws under which he was charged.  He also claimed that he was protected by the principle of &quot;Acts of State&quot; and repeated his &quot;superior orders&quot; defence. On [[May 29]], [[1962]] Israel's Supreme Court, sitting as a Court of Criminal Appeal, rejected the appeal and upheld the District Court's judgment on all counts. On [[May 31]], Israeli president [[Itzhak Ben-Zvi]] turned down Eichmann's petition for mercy. Eichmann was [[hanging|hanged]] a few minutes after midnight on [[ June 1]], [[1962]], at [[Ramla]] prison, officially the only civil [[execution (legal)|execution]] ever carried out in [[Israel]]. Eichmann allegedly refused a last meal, preferring instead a bottle of [[Carmel]], a dry red Israeli wine of which he consumed about half of the bottle. He also refused to don the traditional black hood for his execution.

His last words were, reportedly, &quot;Long live Germany. Long live Austria. Long live Argentina. These are the countries with which I have been most closely associated and I shall not forget them. I had to obey the rules of war and my flag. I am ready.&quot;{{fact}}

His body was cremated and ashes scattered at sea the very next morning, so that no nation would serve as Adolf Eichmann's final resting place.

==Eichmann analysis==
In the 40 years since Eichmann's death, historians have speculated on certain facts regarding his life. The most important question is how responsible Eichmann was for the implementation of [[the Holocaust]].  Most agree that Eichmann knew exactly what he was doing; however, some &quot;Eichmann Defenders&quot; (his son included) state that he was unfairly judged and that he was only doing his duty as a German soldier.  

A third - and highly controversial - analysis came from political theorist [[Hannah Arendt]], a Jew who fled Germany before Hitler's rise, and who reported on Eichmann's trial for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine. In ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'', a book formed by this reporting, Arendt concluded that, aside from a desire for improving his career, Eichmann showed no trace of [[anti-Semitism]] or [[psychological]] damage. She called him the embodiment of the &quot;banality of [[evil]],&quot; as he appeared at his trial to have an ordinary and common personality, displaying neither guilt nor hatred. She suggested that this most strikingly discredits the idea that the Nazi criminals were manifestly [[psychopath]]ic and different from ordinary people. (Many concluded from this and similar observations that even the most ordinary of people can commit horrendous crimes if placed in the right situation, and given the correct incentives, but Arendt disagreed with this interpretation.)

Eichmann's involvement with the SS Underground Group [[ODESSA]] is also a mystery, as there is evidence that Eichmann had contact with the group but did not actively participate in ODESSA activities.  Rumours also abound as to whether or not Eichmann personally knew [[Josef Mengele]] and whether or not the two [[war crimes|war criminals]] ever worked together in South America.  Mossad was convinced that Eichmann was a contact for Mengele and had planned to conduct a dual-capture operation in 1961 had Eichmann revealed Mengele's whereabouts.

A footnote to Eichmann's SS career focuses on the point as to why he was never promoted to the rank of full SS-Colonel, known as ''[[Standartenführer]]''.  With Eichmann's record and responsibilities, he would have been a prime candidate for advancement, yet after 1941, his SS record contains no evidence that he was ever even recommended for another promotion.  Many have speculated that [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] may have seen Eichmann as a dangerous man, rising through the SS ranks, and had curbed his SS career to prevent Eichmann from becoming too powerful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''absolute value''' (or '''modulus'''&lt;sup id=&quot;ref_Argand&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[#endnote_Argand|1]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) of a [[real number]] is its numerical value without regard to its [[sign]]. So, for example, 3 is the absolute value of both 3 and &amp;minus;3.  In computers, the [[mathematical function]] used to perform this calculation is usually given the name '''abs()'''.

Generalizations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings. For example an absolute value is also defined for the [[complex number]]s, the [[quaternion]]s, [[ordered ring]]s, [[Field (mathematics)|field]]s and [[vector space]]s.

The absolute value is closely related to the notions of [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[distance]], and [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] in various mathematical and physical contexts.

[[Image:Absolute value.png|frame|The graph of the absolute value function for real numbers.]] 

==Real numbers==

For any [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;a,&lt;/math&gt; the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of &lt;math&gt;a,&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;sup id=&quot;ref_Wolfram&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[#endnote_Wolfram|2]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;|a|,&lt;/math&gt; and is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;|a| := \begin{cases} a, &amp; \mbox{if }  a \ge 0  \\ -a,  &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; 0. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

As can be seen from the above definition, the absolute value of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is always either [[positive number|positive]] or [[0 (number)|zero]], never [[negative and non-negative numbers|negative]].

From a geometric point of view, the absolute value of a real number is the [[distance]] along the [[real number line]] of that number from zero, and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them. Indeed the notion of an abstract  [[distance function]] in mathematics can be seen to be a generalization of the properties of the absolute value (see [[#Distance|&quot;Distance&quot;]] below).

The following proposition, gives an [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] which is sometimes used as an alternative (and equivalent) definition of the absolute value:

'''PROPOSITION 1''':
:&lt;math&gt;|a| = \sqrt{a^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value has the following four fundamental properties:

'''PROPOSITION 2''':
:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a| \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a| = 0 \iff a = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Positive-definiteness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|ab| = |a||b|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|[[Multiplicativeness]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a+b|  \le |a| + |b|  &lt;/math&gt;
|[[Subadditivity]]
|}

Other important properties of the absolute value include:

'''PROPOSITION 3''':
:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|-a| = |a|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|[[Symmetry]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a - b| = 0 \iff a = b &lt;/math&gt;
|Identity of indiscernibles (equivalent to positive-definiteness)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a - b|  \le |a - c| +|c - b|  &lt;/math&gt;
|[[Triangle inequality]] (equivalent to subadditivity)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a/b| = |a| / |b| \mbox{ (if } b \ne 0) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|Preservation of division (equivalent to multiplicativeness)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a-b| \ge |a| - |b| &lt;/math&gt;
|(equivalent to subadditivity)
|}

Two other useful inequalities are: 
:&lt;math&gt;|a| \le b \iff -b \le a \le b &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|a| \ge b \iff a \le -b \mbox{ or } b \le a &lt;/math&gt;

The above are often used in solving inequalities; for example:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|x-3| \le 9 &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\iff -9 \le x-3 \le 9 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\iff -6 \le x \le 12 &lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Complex numbers ==
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px&quot; title=&quot;Graphic Representation&quot;&gt;
[[image:complex.png]]
&lt;/div&gt;

Since the [[complex number]]s are not [[ordered set|ordered]], the definition given above for the real absolute value cannot be directly generalized for a complex number. However the identity given in Proposition 1:
:&lt;math&gt;|a| = \sqrt{a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
can be seen as motivating the following definition.

For any [[complex number]]

:&lt;math&gt;z = x + iy\,&lt;/math&gt;

the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;|z|,&lt;/math&gt; and is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;|z| :=  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that the absolute value of a real number ''x'' is equal to its absolute value considered as a complex number since:

:&lt;math&gt; |x + i0| = \sqrt{x^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{x^2} = |x|.&lt;/math&gt;

Similar to the geometric interpretation of the absolute value for real numbers, it follows from the [[Pythagorean theorem]] that the absolute value of a complex number is the distance in the [[complex plane]] of that complex number from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]], and more generally, that the absolute value of the difference of two complex numbers is equal to the distance between those two complex numbers.

The complex absolute value shares all the properties of the real absolute value given in Propositions 2 and 3 above. In addition, If

:&lt;math&gt; z = x + \mathrm{i}y = r (\cos \phi + \mathrm{i}\sin \phi ) \,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{z} = x - iy&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[complex conjugate]] of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, then it is easily seen that

:&lt;math&gt;|z| = r\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|z|=|\bar{z}|&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|z| = \sqrt{z\bar{z}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Absolute value functions==
The real absolute value function is [[continuous function|continuous]] everywhere. It is [[derivative|differentiable]] everywhere except for ''x'' = 0.  It is [[monotonic function|monotonically decreasing]] on the interval &lt;nowiki&gt;(-&amp;infin;, 0]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and [[monotonic function|monotonically increasing]] on the interval &lt;nowiki&gt;[0, &amp;infin;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Since a real number and its negative have the same absolute value, it is an [[even function]], and is hence not [[invertible]].

The [[complex number|complex]] absolute value function is continuous everywhere but differentiable ''nowhere'' (One way to see this is to show that it does not obey the [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]]).

Both the real and complex functions are [[idempotent]].

==Ordered rings==
The definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can easily be extended to any [[ordered ring]]. That is, if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is an element of an ordered ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, then the '''absolute value''' of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;|a| &lt;/math&gt;, is defined to be:

:&lt;math&gt;|a| := \begin{cases} a, &amp; \mbox{if }  a \ge 0  \\ -a,  &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; 0, \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;-a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[additive inverse]] of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is the additive [[identity element]].

== Distance==
The absolute value is closely related to the idea of distance. As noted above, the absolute value of a real or complex number is the [[distance]] from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them.

The standard [[Euclidean distance]] between two points

:&lt;math&gt;a = (a_1, a_2, \cdots , a_n) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;b = (b_1, b_2, \cdots , b_n) &lt;/math&gt;

in [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n''-space]] is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(a_1-b_1)^2 + (a_2-b_2)^2 + \cdots + (a_n-b_n)^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This can be seen to be a generalization of &lt;math&gt;|a - b|,&lt;/math&gt; since if &lt;math&gt;a,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;b &lt;/math&gt; are real, then by Proposition 1,
:&lt;math&gt;|a - b| = \sqrt{(a - b)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

while if 

:&lt;math&gt; a = a_1 + i a_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; b = b_1 + i b_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

are complex numbers, then

:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a - b| \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = |(a_1 + i a_2) - (b_1 + i b_2)|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = |(a_1 - b_1) + i(a_2 - b_2)|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = \sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The above shows that the &quot;absolute value&quot; distance for the real numbers or the complex numbers, agrees with the standard Euclidean distance they inherit as a result of considering them as the one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces respectively.

The properties of the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and the triangle inequality given in Propositions 2 and 3 above, can be seen to motivate the more general notion of a [[distance function]] as follows:

A real valued function &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;X \times X&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''distance function''' (or a '''metric''') for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, if it satisfies the following four axioms:

:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a, b) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a, b) = 0 \iff a = b &lt;/math&gt;
|Identity of indiscernibles
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a, b) = d(b, a) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|Symmetry
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a+b)  \le d(a, c) + d(c, b)  &lt;/math&gt;
|Triangle inequality
|}

==Fields==
The fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers given in Proposition 2 above, can be used to generalize the notion of absolute value to an arbitrary field, as follows.

A real-valued function &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; on a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is called an '''absolute value''' (also a ''modulus'', ''magnitude'', ''value'', or ''valuation'') if it satisfies the following four axioms:

:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(a) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(a) = 0 \iff a = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Positive-definiteness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(ab) = v(a) v(b) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|Multiplicativeness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(a+b)  \le v(a) + v(b)  &lt;/math&gt;
|Subadditivity or the triangle inequality
|}

It follows from the above that &lt;math&gt;v(1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; denotes the multiplicative [[identity element]] of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. The real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary field.

If &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is an absolute value on &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, then the function &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;F \times F&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;d(a, b) = v(a - b) &lt;/math&gt;, is a metric, and if &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; is the multiplicative identity in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, then the following are equivalent:

* &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the [[ultrametric]] inequality &lt;math&gt; d(x, y) \le \mathrm{max}\{d(x, z), d(y, z)\}. &lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt; \big\{ v\Big(\sum_{k=1}^n e\Big) : n \in \mathbb{N} \big\} &lt;/math&gt; is [[bounded set|bounded]] in '''R'''.

* &lt;math&gt;  v\Big(\sum_{k=1}^n e\Big) \le 1&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;  n \in \mathbb{N}.&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt; v(a + b) \le \mathrm{max}\{v(a), v(b)\} &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; a, b \in F.&lt;/math&gt;

An absolute value which satisfies any (hence all) of the above conditions is said to be '''non-Archimedean''', otherwise it is said to be [[Archimedean field|Archimedean]].&lt;sup id=&quot;ref_Schechter&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[#endnote_Schechter|3]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

== Vector spaces  ==

Again the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers, can be used, with a slight modification, to generalize the notion to an arbitrary vector space.

A real valued function ||&amp;middot;|| on a [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; a over a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, is called an '''absolute value''' (or more usually a '''[[norm (mathematics)|norm]]''') if it satisfies the following axioms:

For all &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;,

:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{v}\|  \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{v}\| = 0 \iff \mathbf{v} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|Positive-definiteness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|a \mathbf{v}\| = |a| \|\mathbf{v}\| &lt;/math&gt;
|Positive homogeneity or positive scalability
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}\| \le \|\mathbf{v}\| + \|\mathbf{u}\| &lt;/math&gt;
|Subadditivity or triangle inequality
|}

The norm of a vector is also called its ''length'' or ''magnitude''.

In the case of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the function

:&lt;math&gt;\|(x_1, x_2, \cdots , x_n) \| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

is a norm called the [[Euclidean norm]]. When the real numbers '''R''' are considered as the one-dimensional [[vector space]] [[Euclidean space|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]], the absolute value is a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]], and is the [[Norm (mathematics)#Examples|''p''-norm]] for any ''p''. In fact the absolute value is the &quot;only&quot; norm in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, in the sense that, for every norm ||&amp;middot;|| in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ||''x''||=||1||&amp;middot;|''x''|. The complex absolute value is a special case of the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] in an [[inner product space]]. It is identical to the Euclidean norm, if the [[complex plane]] is identified with the [[Euclidean plane]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Algorithms ==

In the [[C programming language]], the &lt;code&gt;abs()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;labs()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;llabs()&lt;/code&gt; (in C99), &lt;code&gt;fabs()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fabsf()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;fabsl()&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the absolute value of an operand. Coding the integer version of the function is trivial, ignoring the boundary case where the largest negative integer is input:

 int abs(int i)
 {
     if (i &lt; 0)
         return -i;
     else
         return i;
 }

The [[floating-point]] versions are trickier, as they have to contend with special codes for [[infinity]] and [[not-a-number]]s.

Using [[assembly language]], it is possible to take the absolute value of a [[processor register|register]] in just three instructions (example shown for a 32-bit register on an [[x86]] architecture, [[Intel]] syntax):

 cdq
 xor eax, edx
 sub eax, edx

&lt;code&gt;cdq&lt;/code&gt; extends the sign bit of &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;edx&lt;/code&gt;.  If &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; is nonnegative, then &lt;code&gt;edx&lt;/code&gt; becomes zero, and the latter two instructions have no effect, leaving &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; unchanged.  If &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; is negative, then &lt;code&gt;edx&lt;/code&gt; becomes 0xFFFFFFFF, or -1.  The next two instructions then become a [[two's complement]] inversion, giving the absolute value of the negative value in &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Arches National Park''' preserves over 2,000 [[natural arch|natural sandstone arches]], including the world-famous [[Delicate Arch]], in addition to a variety of unique geological resources and formations.

The park is located near [[Moab, Utah]], and is 119 square miles ([[1 E8 m²|309 km²]]) in size.  Its highest elevation is 5,653 feet (1,723 m) at Elephant Butte and its lowest elevation is 4,085 feet (1,245 m) at the [[visitor center]].  It receives 10 inches (250 mm) of rain a year on average.

The area, administered by the [[National Park Service]], was originally designated as a [[U.S. National Monument|national monument]] on [[April 12]], [[1929]]. It was redesignated a [[U.S. National Park|national park]] on [[November 12]], [[1971]].  More than 730,000 people visited it in 2004.

==Features==
[[Image:North_&amp;_South_Window_Arches_1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|North Window and South Window Arches]]
Among the notable features of the park are:
* [[Delicate Arch]], a lone-standing arch which has become a symbol of Utah
* [[Balanced Rock]], a large balancing rock
* [[Double Arch]], two arches located close to each other
* [[Landscape Arch]], a very thin, long arch over 300 feet (100 m), the largest in the park
* [[Fiery Furnace (park)|Fiery Furnace]], an area of maze-like narrow passages and tall rock columns
* [[Devil's Garden]], with many arches and columns scattered along a ridge
* [[Dark Angel (park)|Dark Angel]], a free-standing column of dark stone at the end of the Devil's Garden trail  
* [[Courthouse Towers]], a collection of tall columns
* [[Petrified dunes]], petrified remnants of [[sand dunes]] blown from the ancient lakes that covered the area

==Geology==
[[Image:Delicate arch 3d.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Delicate Arch, one of the most famous arches in the park. (USGS){{3d_glasses}}]]
The national park lies atop an underground salt bed, which is basically responsible for the arches and spires, balanced rocks, sandstone fins, and eroded monoliths in the area. Thousands of feet thick in places, this salt bed was deposited over the [[Colorado Plateau]] some 300 million years ago when a sea flowed into the region and eventually evaporated. Over millions of years, the salt bed was covered with residue from floods and winds and the oceans that came in intervals. Much of this debris was compressed into rock. At one time this overlying earth may have been one mile thick.

Salt under pressure is unstable, and the salt bed below Arches was no match for the weight of this thick cover of rock. Under such pressure it shifted, buckled, liquefied, and repositioned itself, thrusting the Earth layers upward into domes. Whole sections dropped into cavities. In places they turned almost on edge. [[Geologic fault|Faults]] occurred. The result of one such 2,500-foot displacement, the [[Moab Fault]], is seen from the visitor center.

As this subsurface movement of salt shaped the Earth, surface erosion stripped away the younger rock layers. Except for isolated remnants, the major formations visible in the park today are the salmon-colored [[Entrada Sandstone]], in which most of the arches form, and the buff-colored [[Navajo Sandstone]]. These are visible in layer cake fashion throughout most of the park. Over time water seeped into the superficial cracks, joints, and folds of these layers. Ice formed in the fissures, expanding and putting pressure on surrounding rock, breaking off bits and pieces. Winds later cleaned out the loose particles. A series of free-standing fins remained. Wind and water attacked these fins until, in some, the cementing material gave way and chunks of rock tumbled out. Many damaged fins collapsed. Others, with the right degree of hardness and balance, survived despite their missing sections. These became the famous arches. This is the geologic story of Arches - probably. The evidence is largely circumstantial.

==History==
[[Image:Turret_Arch_1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Turret Arch]]
Humans have occupied the region since the last [[ice age]] 10,000 years ago.  [[Fremont people]] and [[Ancient Pueblo People]] lived in the area up until about 700 years ago.  Spanish missionaries encountered Ute and Paitue tribes in the area when they first came through in [[1775]], but the first European-Americans to attempt settlement in the area were the [[Mormon]] [[Elk Mountain Mission]] in [[1855]], but then soon abandoned the area.  Ranchers, farmers, and prospectors later settled Moab in the neighboring riverine valley in the 1880s.  Word of the beauty in the surrounding [[rock formations]] spread beyond the settlement as a possible tourist destination.

The Arches area was first brought to the attention of the National Park Service by Frank A. Wadleigh, passenger traffic manager of the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]]. Wadleigh, accompanied by railroad photographer George L. Beam, visited the area in September 1923 at the invitation of Alexander Ringhoffer, a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[prospector]] living in Salt Valley. Ringhoffer had written to the railroad in an effort to interest them in the tourist potential of a scenic area he had discovered the previous year with his two sons and a son-in-law, which he called the &quot;Devil's Garden&quot; (known today as the &quot;Klondike Bluffs&quot;). Wadleigh was impressed by what Ringhoffer showed him, and suggested to Park Service director Stephen T. Mather that the area be made a national monument.

The following year additional support for the monument idea came from Laurence M. Gould, a University of Michigan graduate student studying the geology of the nearby La Sal mountains, who was shown the scenic area by retired local physician Dr. J.W. &quot;Doc&quot; Williams.

[[image:Landscape arch 20030917 093317 1.1504x807.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Landscape Arch]]

A succession of government investigators examined the area, in part due to confusion as to the precise location. In the process the name &quot;Devil's Garden&quot; was transposed to an area on the opposite side of Salt Valley, and Ringhoffer's original discovery was omitted, while another area nearby, known locally as &quot;The Windows&quot;, was included. Designation of the area as a national monument was supported by the Park Service from [[1926]], but was resisted by President [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s Interior Secretary. Finally in April [[1929]], shortly after his inauguration, President [[Herbert Hoover]] signed a presidential proclamation creating Arches National Monument, consisting of two comparatively small, disconnected sections. The purpose of the reservation under the 1906 [[Antiquities Act]] was to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value. The name &quot;Arches&quot; was suggested by Frank Pinkely, superintendent of the Park Service's southwestern national monuments, following a visit to the Windows section in 1925.

In late [[1938]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed a proclamation which enlarged the Arches to protect additional scenic features and permit development of facilities to promote tourism. A small adjustment was made by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in [[1960]] to accommodate a new road alignment.

In early [[1969]], just before leaving office, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] signed a proclamation substantially enlarging the Arches. Two years later President [[Richard Nixon]] signed legislation enacted by Congress which significantly reduced the area of Arches, but changed its status to a National Park.

==Publicity==
American writer [[Edward Abbey]] was a [[park ranger]] at Arches National Monument when he kept journals that became his book ''Desert Solitaire''.  The success of this book, as well as the rise in [[adventure tourism|adventure-based recreation]], has drawn many [[hikers]], [[mountain bike|mountain-bikers]], and [[off-road]] enthusiasts to the area, but activities are limited within park boundaries: camping, foot hiking (along designated trails), and driving only along marked roads.

The opening scenes of the movie ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' were filmed at the park.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''analog''' or '''analogue''' signal is any variable signal [[continuous function|continuous]] in both time and amplitude. It differs from a [[digital signal]] in that small fluctuations in the signal are meaningful. Analog is usually thought of in an [[electricity|electrical]] context, however mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, and other systems may also use analog signals.

The word &quot;analog&quot; implies an [[analogy]] between cause and effect, voltage in and voltage out, current in and current out, sound in and frequency out.

An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information. For example, an [[aneroid barometer]] uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information. Electrically, the property most commonly used is [[voltage]] followed closely by [[frequency]], [[Current (electricity)|current]], and [[electric charge|charge]].

Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal, often such a signal is a measured [[response]] to changes in physical phenomena, such as [[sound]], [[light]], [[temperature]], [[position]], or [[pressure]], and is achieved using a [[transducer]].

For example, in an analog sound recording, the variation in [[pressure]] of a [[sound]] striking a [[microphone]] creates a corresponding variation in the voltage amplitude of a current passing through it. An increase in the volume of the sound causes the fluctuation of the current's voltage amplitude to increase while keeping the same rhythm.

The primary disadvantage of analog signalling is that any system has [[Noise (physics)|noise]]&amp;mdash;that is, random variations&amp;mdash;in it. As the signal is copied and re-copied, or transmitted over long distances, these random variations become dominant. Electrically these losses are lessened by shielding, good connections, and several cable types such as coax and twisted pair.

The effects of [[signal noise|noise]] make signal loss and distortion impossible to recover, since amplifying the signal to recover attenuated parts of the signal amplifies the noise as well.

Another method of conveying an analog signal is to use [[modulation]]. In this, some base signal (e.g., a [[sinusoidal]] [[carrier wave]]) has one of its properties modulated: [[amplitude modulation]] involves altering the amplitude of a sinusoidal voltage [[wave]]form by the source information, [[frequency modulation]] changes the [[frequency]]. Other techniques, such as changing the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the base signal also work.

Analog circuits do not involve [[quantisation]] of information into digital format. The concept being measured over the circuit, whether sound, light, pressure, temperature, or an exceeded limit, remains from end to end.

[[Clock]]s with hands are called analog; those that display digits are called digital. However, many analog clocks are actually digital since the hands do not move in a smooth continuous motion, but in small steps every second or half a second, or every minute with a loud CLUNK.

See [[digital]] for a discussion of ''digital vs. analog''.

'''''And Then There Were None''''' (also known as '''''Ten Little Indians''''' and originally as '''''Ten Little Niggers''''') is a [[detective fiction|detective novel]] by [[Agatha Christie]] first published in [[1939]].

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}

The story focuses on ten strangers who are all (but one) brought, by misleading information, to an [[Burgh Island|island]] off the coast of [[Devon]], in southern [[England]].

The characters are:
*Vera Claythorne, a young teacher in a third class school
*Philip Lombard, a down-on-his luck explorer/mercenary
*William Blore, a retired police inspector, now a private investigator
*Dr. Edward Armstrong, a private physician
*Justice Lawrence Wargrave, a bitter, cynical retired judge
*Emily Brent, an elderly spinster and a religious zealot of extreme proportions
*Rogers, the butler
*General Macarthur, a lonely, retired army man
*Mrs. Rogers, the housekeeper, Rogers' wife
*Anthony Marston, a reckless playboy

On their first night, the ten realize that they have been brought to the island under false pretenses,  but now have no means of getting away. A mysterious gramophone recording informs them that all ten of them are guilty of &quot;murders,&quot; though in this case the killings cannot be dealt with by law.

On the first night, Anthony Marston dies of posioning. In the morning, Mrs. Rogers fails to wake up and it is determined that she probably had a fatal overdose of sleeping drugs. At lunch the next day, General Macarthur is found dead by a blow to the back of his head. After searching the island for the murderer or possible hiding spots, the survivors realize that the murderer can only be one of them, and whoever it is, is playing a game - killing them in manners poetically similar to a nursery rhyme, and also removing one of ten little figurines in the dining room after each death. The survivors have a meeting and discover that none of them have an alibi for any of the deaths.

The next morning Rogers is found dead in the woodshed, having been killed with a giant axe that was nearby. Later that day, Emily Brent dies from an injection of [[potassium cyanide]]. The five remaining - Dr. Armstrong, Justice Wargrave, Philip Lombard, Vera Claythorne, and Inspector Blore - become increasingly paranoid. Later, Justice Wargrave is found dead, having been shot through the head. That night, Dr. Armostrong leaves the house, and when the rest of the survivors search for him they cannot find him.

Vera, Inspector Blore, and Philip Lombard go outside. Blore decides to go back to the house to get some sustinance, and a dull thud is heard. When Vera and Philip check to see what happened, they find Blore crushed to death by a heavy marble clock. They assume Doctor Armstrong did it and decide to stay out of the house. The two survivors get back to the beach only to find Armstrong's body washed up on the shore. Vera and Lombard they realise that they are the only two left. Even though they could not possibly have mudered the Inspector, the never ending suspicion has driven them to a breaking point and they assume each other as the murderers. Philip Lombard reaches for he revolver, only to discover that Vera Claythorne pickpoketed it. She shoots him and then returns to the house, thinking she is finally safe. When Vera gets to her room, she discovers a noose hanging there, and having been finally driven crazy by the entire experience, she hangs herself, thus fullfilling the rhyme upon which the murders were based.

So, by the novel's end, all ten guests are dead, leaving a &quot;[[locked room mystery]].&quot; A police investigation, though thorough, cannot find any satisfactory explanation. It is resolved when a letter in a bottle, tossed into the ocean and recovered by a trawler, is delivered to the police, which was written by the murderer.

==Film and Theater==

Christie had been disappointed in previous adaptations of her novels. As she had written a play before, she decided to adapt her own book herself. She decided that the staging of a play required the survival of two characters in order to carry the plot exposition. Consequently the resolution of the play is very different from that of the book (though the identity of the killer remains the same). This stage version dates from [[1943]]. All but one of the films followed the play's humourous tone &amp; ending, rather than the book's dark tone and downbeat resolution.  

The story was adapted for the cinema as ''And Then There Were None'' in [[1945]] and again in [[1974]]; and also filmed as ''Ten Little Indians'' in [[1959]] (as truncated television recording of the play), [[1965]], [[1974]], [[1989]] and as ''Ten Little Niggers'' in [[1987]]. The 1945 &amp; 1987 film versions were the most successful and took fewer liberties with Christie's plot than some of the other versions.  The 1945 film was [[film director|directed]] by [[Rene Clair]] from a [[screenplay]] by [[Dudley Nichols]]. The 1987 film was written, produced and directed by renowed [[Russia|Russian]] [[filmmaker]], [[Stanislav Govorukhin]].

The 1987 version was an extremely faithful-to-the-novel film adaptation made in [[Russia]], the title of which (''&quot;Desyat Negrityat&quot;'') translates directly to the novel's original title, ''Ten Little Niggers'' (since the novel's title was never altered in most of the world outside of [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]].) The Russian version is the only adaptation that didn't change any of the characters or the ending of the book. It is most famous in Russia for having a legendary ensemble cast of the most famous and talented actors in Russia. Arguably, the Russian production is even more star-studded than any of the [[Hollywood]] versions.

These film versions usually feature all-star casts and are set in different locations, such as the [[Austria|Austrian]] [[Alps]], the [[Iran|Iranian]] desert, and the [[Africa|African]] jungle. The only ones to keep the island as the location were the [[1945]] and the [[1987]] versions.

The basic concept of the plot has been recycled countless times, often without crediting Christie (who herself recycled numerous story concepts.)  The most recent example is probably the 2004 [[crime]] [[thriller]] ''[[Mindhunters]]'', which includes many elements of Christie's original story, including an island and various plot twists.

In 2005 a new version of ''And Then There Were None'' was performed in London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. Written by [[Kevin Elyot]] and directed by [[Steven Pimlott]], it is based on the novel rather than on Christie's drama.

==The rhyme==
The book's original title &quot;Ten Little Niggers&quot; was taken from the chorus of an [[United States|American]] [[comic song]], written by [[Septimus Winner]] in [[1868]]; there are many variants of the lyrics, of which &quot;Ten Little [[Injuns]]&quot; is probably the most familiar to modern audiences.  The song is now considered by many to be [[racist]] and offensive.

The rhyme used in the novel is as follows:

&lt;!--This needs transwiki-ing to wikisource --&gt; 
:Ten little Indian boys going out to dine; 
::One choked his little self and then there were nine. 
:Nine little Indian boys sat up very late; 
::One overslept himself and then there were eight. 
:Eight little Indian boys traveling in Devon; 
::One said he'd stay and then there were seven. 
:Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks; 
::One chopped himself into halves and then there were six. 
:Six little Indian boys playing with a hive; 
::A [[bumblebee]] stung one and then there were five. 
:Five little Indian boys going in for law; 
::One got in [[Chancery]] and then there were four. 
:Four little Indian boys going out to sea; 
::A [[red herring]] swallowed one and then there were three. 
:Three little Indian boys walking in the zoo; 
::A big bear hugged one and then there were two. 
:Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun; 
::One got frizzled up and then there was one. 
:One little Indian boy left all alone; 
::He went and hanged himself and then there were none.

==Ten Little Indians and 'and then there was one' in Popular Culture==

The [[meme]]s 'Ten Little Indians' and 'and then there was one' have been used many times in modern days to refer to situations in stories - oftentimes [[slasher film]]s, other [[horror film]]s, and [[disaster film]]s - in which the characters die off one by one. This is how many films of those genres are structured, in order to provide gory scenes periodically, and to ultimately force the [[main character]] to face off against the [[villain]] alone. This main character in slasher films is often the '[[Final Girl]].'

==Trivia==
* &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; was adapted from [[Agatha Christie]]'s book into a video game in 2005 by [[The Adventure Company | The Adventure Company]]. It was released in November of that year to mixed reviews, most of the slack going to changing the &quot;Indians&quot; to &quot;Sailors,&quot; in a case of political correctness gone awry, and altering the killer's motive &amp; identity, though it is possible to see the original novel's ending when one finishes a puzzle after completing the main game. Four further books are to be adapted.

* &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; is a song by [[The Yardbirds]] along the same lines with the rhyme, although more dismal. In the song, the death of each &quot;Indian&quot; is related to breaking one of the [[Ten Commandments]].

* A Japanese [[doujin]] game, [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]], features an extra stage of a girl having the spell card named &quot;And Then Will There be None?&quot;, and a theme music named &quot;Is she the U.N.Owen?&quot;. (U.N.Owen is the killer's alias used in the novel, play, and films.)

* &quot;Zehn Kleine [[Jägermeister]]&quot; (Ten Little &quot;Jägermeister&quot;) is a song by the German band [[Die Toten Hosen]], along the same lines as the rhyme, but with funny or satirical things happening to the characters (taking drugs, being arrested for tax evasion, dying of [[Mad Cow Disease]] etc)

* Polish 2003 film [[Show (film)|Show]], starring [[Cezary Pazura]], tells the story of a reality show located on a remote island. Suddenly, the competitors start to die one after another. One of the competitors even mention Agatha Christies' novel.

'''Hercule Poirot''' (pronounced {{IPA|[ɛʀkyl pwaʀo]}}) is a [[fictional character]], the primary detective of [[Agatha Christie]]'s novels. He appears in over 30 novels and over 50 short stories and is probably one of the most famous characters ever made. 

The character was born in [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], [[Belgium]], and has worked as a Belgian police officer, notably in [[Brussels]], but moved to [[England]] during [[World War I]] and started a second career as a [[private investigator|private detective]].  Poirot is remarkable for his small stature and egg-shaped head, his cat-like green eyes, his meticulous moustache, his dandified dressing habits, his absolute obsession with order and neatness, and his disdain for detective methods that include crawling on hands and knees and looking for clues.  He prefers to examine the psychology of a crime to discover more evidence, once even betting his best friend and sometime partner, [[Arthur Hastings]], that he could solve a case simply by sitting in an easy chair and using his &quot;little grey cells.&quot;

Like a large number of detectives of the early days of mystery fiction (including [[Miss Marple]], [[Sherlock Holmes (character)|Sherlock Holmes]], and [[Father Brown]]), Poirot is unmarried.  The love of his life, Countess Vera Rossakoff, appears in the short stories &quot;The Double Clue&quot; and &quot;The Capture of Cerberus&quot; and the novel ''The Big Four''.

His fictional address (from his business card) is 56B Whitehaven Mansions,
Sandhurst Square, London W1. The building used in the series can be found on Charterhouse Square - City of London.

==Major novels==

The Poirot books take readers through the whole of his life in England, from the first book (''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]''), where he is a refugee staying at Styles, to the last Poirot book (''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]''), where he visits Styles once again before his death.  In between, Poirot solves cases outside England as well, including his most famous case, ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1934).

Hercule Poirot became famous with the publication, in [[1926]], of ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', whose surprising solution proved controversial.  The novel is still among the most famous of all detective novels: [[Edmund Wilson]] alludes to it in the title of his well-known attack on detective fiction, &quot;Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?&quot;  Aside from ''Roger Ackroyd'', the most critically-acclaimed Poirot novels appeared from [[1932]] to [[1942]], including such acknowledged classics as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', ''[[The ABC Murders]]'' (1935), ''[[Cards on the Table]]'' (1936), and ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937).  The last of these, a tale of multiple homicide upon a Nile steamer, was judged by the celebrated detective novelist [[John Dickson Carr]] to be among the ten greatest mystery novels of all time.

The [[1942]] novel ''[[Five Little Pigs]]'' (aka ''Murder in Retrospect''), in which Poirot investigates a murder committed sixteen years before by analyzing various accounts of the tragedy, is a ''[[Rashomon (movie)|Rashomon]]''-like performance that critic and mystery novelist Robert Barnard called the best of the Christie novels.

==Recurring characters==

While the majority of the supporting cast in the Poirot stories is always different, some characters do show up more often.  [[Arthur Hastings]], whom Poirot met almost immediately after arriving in England, becomes his life-long partner and appears in many of the novels and stories.  Other frequently recurring characters include the detective novelist [[Ariadne Oliver]], Agatha Christie's humorous self-caricature, and Poirot's secretary, Miss Lemon. [[Chief Inspector Japp]] of Scotland Yard appears in many of the stories, as well.  The mysterious [[Russia]]n Countess Vera Rossakoff, Poirot's only known love interest, appears in three stories.

{{sect-stub}}
Hercule Poirot has been played by several actors.  The character first appeared onscreen in [[1931]], played by [[Austin Trevor]].  Perhaps the most notable portrayals have been by [[Albert Finney]] in the cinematic version of ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', and [[David Suchet]] in a long series of television productions.  The role has also been played more than once by [[Peter Ustinov]] and by [[Tony Randall]], [[Ian Holm]], and [[Alfred Molina]].

In 2004, [[NHK]] (a Japanese TV network) produced a 39 episode [[anime]] series titled ''[[Agatha Christie's Famous Detectives Poirot and Marple]] (Agatha Christie no Meitantei Poirot to Marple)'', as well as a manga series by the same title released starting in 2005. The series ran from [[July 4]], [[2004]] through [[May 15]], [[2005]], and is now being shown as [[rerun]]s on NHK and other networks in Japan. Poirot was voiced by [[Kōtarō Satomi]] (Satomi Kōtarō) and Miss Marple was voiced by [[Kaoru Yachigusa]] (Yachigusa Kaoru).

'''Jane Marple''', usually known as '''Miss Marple''', is a [[fictional character]] appearing in many [[Agatha Christie]] novels.

She lives in the little village of [[St. Mary Mead]]. She looks like an ordinary [[spinster]], in [[Harris Tweed|tweed]] and with a curiosity as wide as the world, but when it comes to solving mysteries, she turns out to have a sharp logical mind. In the best [[detective fiction|detective story]] tradition, she often embarrasses the local &quot;professional&quot; police, usually by making an analogy with some village occurrence or character.  

==Personality==
When we first meet Jane Marple she is very much the stereotypical spinster of the last century — blue-eyed and frail, wearing a black lace cap and mittens, and constantly knitting. She is also a gleeful gossip and not especially nice. The first Marple novel, ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' sees a markedly different Marple to the one who would appear in later books, as she modernized and became nicer over the years.

Miss Marple's nephew, the &quot;well-known author&quot; Raymond West and his wife Joan (who first appeared as Joyce), a modern artist, were introduced in 1933 in ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]''. Raymond, in particular, is overconfident of himself and dismissive of Miss Marple's mental powers, though she continually upstages him in the end.

''[[A Murder is Announced]]'' ([[1950]]), Agatha Christie's fiftieth novel, is regarded by some as the best Miss Marple novel, and one of the best of Christie's [[whodunit]]s.

Miss Marple is able to solve difficult crimes not only because of her shrewd intelligence, but because St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has put on a pageant of human depravity rivaled only by that of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. No crime can arise without reminding Miss Marple of some parallel incident in the history of her time. 

As with her other famous detective [[Hercule Poirot]], Christie wrote a concluding novel to her Marple series, ''Sleeping Murder'', in [[1940]] and saved it for her old age, causing some embarrassing discrepancies as people who were written off as dead (such as Dolly Bantry's husband, Colonel Arthur Bantry) by the time her mystery &quot;Nemesis&quot; was published, which was the preceding Marple mystery '''but actually the last one written''', appear alive in ''Sleeping Murder'' having been resurrected from the fictional dead. ''Sleeping Murder'' was published in [[1976]], shortly after Christie's death, and was the last of her novels to be published, although, again, it was written in [[1940]].

==Books featuring Miss Marple==
* ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' ([[1930]])
* ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' ([[1942]])
* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' ([[1943]])
* ''[[A Murder is Announced]]'' ([[1950]])
* ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]], or Murder With Mirrors'' ([[1952]])
* ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' ([[1953]])
* ''[[4.50 from Paddington|4.50 from Paddington, or What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!]]'' ([[1957]])

* ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' ([[1965]])
* ''[[Nemesis (Christie)|Nemesis]]'' ([[1971]])
* ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (written around [[1940]], published [[1976]])

==Quotation==
*&quot;The young people think the old people are fools, but the old people ''know'' the young people are fools&quot; &amp;ndash; Miss Marple's motto, in several of the books and stories.
==[[Film|Movies]]==
[[Image:Margaret_Rutherford_is_Miss_Marple.jpg|thumb|right|[[Margaret Rutherford]] as '''Miss Marple''']]

Although popular from her first appearance in [[1930]], Jane Marple had to wait thirty-two years for her first big-screen appearance; when she made it, the results were disappointing to both Christie purists and Christie herself. ''[[Murder, She Said]]'' ([[1962]], directed by [[George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Dame [[Margaret Rutherford]], a magnificent comic actress but too boisterous and loud for the prim and birdlike character Christie created. This first film was based on the [[1957]] novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy doesn't see anything because there is no Mrs. McGillicuddy. Miss Marple herself sees apparent murder committed on a train passing hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. 

The other Rutherford films (all directed by George Pollock) were ''Murder at the Gallop'' ([[1963]]), based on the [[1953]] Hercule Poirot novel ''[[After the Funeral]]''; ''Murder Most Foul'' ([[1964]]), based on the [[1952]] Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''Murder Ahoy'' ([[1964]]), not based on any Christie work. 

In [[1980]], [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''The Mirror Crack'd'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's [[1962]] novel. However, Lansbury is only on screen for a short time, the bulk of the film being taken up with the machinations of an all-star cast that included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Kim Novak]]. [[Edward Fox]] appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork.

American stage and screen legend [[Helen Hayes]] portrayed Miss Marple in two American made-for-TV movies, both for [[CBS]]: ''A Caribbean Mystery'' ([[1983]]) and ''Murder with Mirrors'' ([[1984]]). [[Sue Grafton]] contributed to the screenplay of the former. Hayes's Marple was benign and chirpy.

==Television and Radio==
American TV was the setting for the first dramatic portrayal of Miss Marple. [[Gracie Fields]], a legendary British actress, played the geriatric sleuth in a [[1956]] episode of ''Goodyear TV Playhouse'' based on ''A Murder Is Announced'', the [[1950]] Christie novel. 

There was a long-running and popular [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] TV series in the [[1980s]] with [[Joan Hickson]], an octogenarian herself, who had appeared in a small role in the Rutherford film ''Murder, She Said''. The consensus among Christie devotees was that hers was the definitive performance. All twelve Miss Marple novels were dramatized: ''The Body in the Library''; ''The Moving Finger''; ''A Murder Is Announced''; ''A Pocket Full of Rye''; ''Murder at the Vicarage''; ''Sleeping Murder''; ''At Bertram's Hotel''; ''Nemesis''; ''4:50 from Paddington''; ''A Caribbean Mystery''; ''They Do It with Mirrors'' and ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side''. All these serializations were shown in the United States on the [[PBS]] ''[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple/index.html Mystery!]'' series. It was also televised in Germany.  The television show followed the plots of the books considerably more closely than did the Rutherford films.

[[BBC Radio 4]] also dramatised several of the books with [[June Whitfield]] as Miss Marple.  

[[Angela Lansbury]], after playing Miss Marple in ''The Mirror Crack'd'', went on to star in the TV series ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' as [[Jessica Fletcher]], a novelist who solves crimes. The character was to some degree based on Miss Marple and another Christie character, [[Ariadne Oliver]].

[[Image:Geraldine McEwan.jpg|thumb|right|Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple]]
In 2004, [[Granada Television]], in collaboration with [[Agatha Christie Limited]], produced four adaptations (namely ''The Body in the Library'', ''Murder in the Vicarage'', ''4.50 from Paddington'' and ''A Murder is Announced'') starring [[Geraldine McEwan]] in the title role, and also featuring [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Ian Richardson]], [[Zoe Wanamaker]], [[Miriam Margolyes]], [[Janet McTeer]], [[Derek Jacobi]], [[Claire Skinner]] and [[Stephen Tompkinson]] in supporting roles. In 2005 and 2006, four more mysteries are being made...but two of them aren't even Miss Marple books! They are [[Sleeping Murder]], [[The Moving Finger]], [[By the Pricking of My Thumbs (novel)]], and [[The Sittaford Mystery]].

In 2004, [[NHK]] (a Japanese TV network) produced a 39 episode [[anime]] series titled ''[[Agatha Christie's Famous Detectives Poirot and Marple]] (アガサ・クリスティーの名探偵ポワロとマープル, Agasa Kurisutii no Meitantei Powaro to Maapuru)'', as well as a manga series by the same title released starting in 2005. The series ran from [[July 4]], [[2004]] through [[May 15]], [[2005]], and is now being shown as [[rerun]]s on NHK and other networks in Japan. Poirot was voiced by [[Kōtarō Satomi]] (里見 浩太朗, Satomi Kōtarō) and Miss Marple was voiced by [[Kaoru Yachigusa]] (八千草 薫, Yachigusa Kaoru).

{{wiktionarypar|April}}
'''April''' is the [[fourth]] [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian Calendar]] and one of four with the length of 30 [[day]]s.

April begins (astrologically) with the sun in the sign of [[Aries]] and ends in the sign of [[Taurus]]. Astronomically speaking, the sun begins in the constellation of [[Pisces]] and ends in the constellation of [[Aries]].

The derivation of the name ([[Latin]] ''aprillis'') is uncertain. The traditional etymology from the Latin ''aperire'', &quot;to open,&quot; in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to &quot;open,&quot; is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of &amp;alpha;&amp;#788;&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;iota;&amp;xi;&amp;iota;&amp;sigmaf; (opening) for spring. Since all the Roman months were named in honour of divinities, and as April was sacred to Venus, the ''Festum Veneris et Fortunae Virilis'' being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month Aphrilis, from her Greek name Aphrodite, or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''Apru''. Jacob Grimm suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''

The Anglo-Saxons called April ''Oster-monath'' or ''Eostur-monath'', the period sacred to ''Eostre'' or ''Ostara'', the pagan Saxon goddess of spring, from whose name is derived the modern Easter.  St George's day is the twenty-third of the month; and St Mark's Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth. In China the symbolical ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood takes place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to our April; and in Japan the feast of Dolls is celebrated in the same month.

The &quot;days of April&quot; (''journées d'avril'') is a name appropriated in French history to a series of insurrections at Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of Louis Philippe in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the ''procès d'avrill''. 

April was originally the second month of the [[Roman calendar]] and had 29 days. [[Julius Caesar]]'s calendar [[Julian calendar|reform]] in [[45 BCE]] resulted in April having 30 days and becoming the fourth month, as the year now began in [[January]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{AugustCalendar}}

'''August''' is the [[eighth]] month of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian Calendar]] and one of seven Gregorian months with the length of 31 [[days]].

August begins (astrologically) with the sun in the sign of [[Leo]] and ends in the sign of [[Virgo]]. Astronomically speaking, the sun begins in the constellation of [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] and ends in the constellation of [[Leo]].

August was named in honor of [[Augustus]]. The month reputedly has 31 days because Augustus wanted as many days as [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[July]]. Augustus placed the month where it is because that is when [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]] died.  Before Augustus renamed August, it was called ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], since it was the sixth month in the [[Roman calendar]] which started in [[March]].

In the [[neopaganism|pagan]] [[wheel of the year]] August begins at or near [[Lughnasadh]] in the [[northern hemisphere]] and [[Imbolc]] in the [[southern hemisphere]].

In [[Ireland]], (in the [[Irish language]])  August is known as '''Lúnasa''', a modern rendition of [[Lughnasadh]], named after the god [[Lugh]] and  [[August 1]], (Lá Lúnasa) in the [[Irish Calendar]] is still regarded as the first day of [[Autumn]]. The first Monday in August is one of the [[public holidays in the Republic of Ireland]].

In the [[Japanese calendar|old Japanese calendar]], the month is called ''hatsuki'' (&amp;#33865;&amp;#26376;).

In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the month is called ''elokuu'', meaning &quot;month of reaping&quot;.

In the [[UK]], August is generally when all academic exam results are published, especially for [[GCSE]]s and [[A-Levels]] as well as other exams. Also, scholars and school workers such as teachers, have a holiday or non-contact time, and there are two bank holidays (UK). It is typically when people go on holiday due to the availability of time.  

During August 13 to 19, [[Philippines]] schools and theaters celebrate the National Week of the [[Tagalog|Filipino]] Language.

In [[Spain]], August is the holiday month for most workers.

In [[Brazil]], folk superstition associates bad luck to August, with the proverb ''&quot;Agosto, o mês do desgosto&quot;'' (&quot;August, the month of misfortune&quot;) being often heard. This may come from the sinister memories of the [[Bartholomew|St. Bartholomew]]'s day (August 24), which is particularly dreaded in the Northeast of the country. August 24 is also, in the tradition of [[Candomblé]], the day of [[Eshu]], one of the most malevolent deities. Coincidentally, some unfortunate polical events took place in August, like the suicide of the then President [[Getúlio Vargas]]. [http://www.tvgazeta.com.br/todoseu/assuntos_programas_notas.php?v_id_notas=55&amp;r_titulo=A]

Every last Sunday of August, the [[Philippines]] celebrates National Heroes Day in commemoration of the First Cry of the Philippine Revolution on [[August 23]], [[1896]].

August is also the name of a Japanese [[visual novel]] company.
