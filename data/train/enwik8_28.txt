      <comment>example of the logical fallacy</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Affirming the antecedent''' is a valid [[argument form]] which proceeds by affirming the truth of the first part (the &quot;if&quot; part, commonly called the antecedent) of a [[conditional]], and concluding that the second part (the &quot;then&quot; part, commonly called the consequent) is true.  It is commonly referred to as [[Modus ponens]], or &quot;method of affirming.&quot;

:If ''P'', then ''Q''.
:''P''.
:Therefore, ''Q''.

In [[logical operator]] notation, this is symbolized
:&lt;math&gt; p \rightarrow q &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \vdash p, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \vdash q &lt;/math&gt;

Many people assume that this works the other way as well, so that one could say:

:If ''P'' then ''Q''.
:''Q''.
:Therefore ''P''.

In [[logical operator]] notation, this is symbolized
:&lt;math&gt; p \rightarrow q &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \vdash q, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \vdash p &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[logical assertion]].

But this is a [[Logical fallacy]] called [[Affirming the consequent]]. Since ''P'' implies ''Q'', but ''Q'' does not necessarily imply ''P''. 

You can see this if we simply substitute in actual statements for ''P''. and ''Q''. 

If the electrical system has failed, then it is dark in this room.
It is dark in this room. 
So the electrical system has failed. 

One can see intuitively that the conclusion fails, even if both premises are true, because there might be plenty of other explanations for the darkness in the room. 

Sometimes ''P'' and ''Q'' entail each other, in that case we can say ''P'' if and only if ''Q''. (Sometimes the shorthand ''P'' [[iff]] ''Q'' is used rather than writing out if and only if).

'''''Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri''''' (sometimes abbreviated to '''SMAC''') is a [[turn-based game|turn-based]] [[strategy game|strategy]] [[4X]] [[computer game]] created by [[Brian Reynolds]] and [[Sid Meier]] under the auspices of [[Firaxis Games]] in [[1999]]. It is based on a hypothetical attempt by human beings to [[Space colonization|colonize]] a planet in the [[Alpha Centauri|Alpha Centauri star system]]. It picks up where the games [[Civilization (computer game)|''Sid Meier's Civilization I'' &amp; ''II'']] left off.  An expansion pack, ''[[Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire]]'' (aka '''SMACX''' or just '''SMAX''') was later released.  Both -- the original Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri and the Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire expansion pack -- were later released in a combined edition called a &quot;Planetary Pack.&quot;

==Storyline== 
According to the storyline of the game, [[Earth]] has destroyed itself through [[war]], [[disease]], [[famine]], and other [[catastrophe]]s. The [[United Nations]] manages to launch a colonization [[starship]], the ''Unity'', to [[Alpha Centauri]], where an Earth-like planet, Chiron (often just called &quot;Planet&quot;), has been discovered; it is hoped that the best and brightest of mankind aboard the ''Unity'' can build a perfect civilization there. 

As the ''Unity'' approaches Alpha Centauri, a malfunction occurs, waking the top [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] from suspended animation. During the crew's attempt to repair the damage, the commander, Captain Garland, is assassinated. Due to the critical damage of the ''Unity'', the ship's seven top officers each, together with likeminded crewmembers, lay claim to an escape pod and land on Chiron. These seven, with their conflicting personalities and ideologies, then begin to build seven seperate [[society|societies]] according to those ideologies - leading humanity once again to [[faction]]alism and war.

(Note: The game's intro video depicts an eighth escape pod separating from the ''Unity'', only to explode shortly thereafter, though there is no mention of an eighth faction at any point in the game.)

==Game play==
[[Image:SMACx-DiploScreenshot1.jpg|thumb|right|Alpha Centauri screenshot]]
Within the game, the player assumes the role of one of the seven [[Political faction|faction]] leaders and attempts to expand their colony and achieve victory. Players engage themselves in a race against the other factions, and are free to adopt any number of strategies in pursuit of their goal. Scientific discoveries within the game determine what technologies are available to particular factions, which in turn determines what facilities and units they can build at their colony bases. Unlike the previous [[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]] games and [[Civilization III]], ''Alpha Centauri'' allows the player to fully customize units. [[Civilization IV]] expanded on this system. 

Also, while not unique in this regard, ''Alpha Centauri'' is an unusual civilization-building game because it is open-ended and has multiple, customizable parameters for victory. The player can choose to work toward a victory based on [[diplomacy]], [[economics]], [[conquest]], or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]].

===The Datalinks===
A crucial part of the game is the Datalinks, an information system that contains any and all information that you may need. It is similar to Civilization's Civilopedia. Most important is the tech tree, which shows a complete system of all technologies available in the game, along with prerequisite technologies and all benefits the technology gives (new chassis, weapon, armor, reactor, or special ability types, along with new former abilities, base facilities and secret projects, bonuses to xenofungus squares, social engineering choices, etc.) In all technology trades the game allows you to consult the Datalinks to find exactly what is being offered (or demanded).

In addition, the Datalinks store the quotes involved with all technologies, base facilities, and secret projects. Many Alpha Centauri fans enjoy the quotes in particular and the thought behind them. The game's creators did an excellent job of developing the personality and ideology of all the faction leaders through these quotes, as well as thoughts on human psychology. For instance, the Virtual World secret project is accompanied by Chairman Yang's view that reality is only what you perceive it to be, while Provost Zakarov denounces the general simplistic views on genetics when such technologies are discovered.

===Terrain===
The game is represented on a three-dimensional map of the planet surface, upon which bases are built and units deployed. Local features of the terrain influence the amount of resources a base harvests from any particular square. For example, rocky squares yield minerals but no food unless cleared, while river squares produce extra energy. The altitude of terrain influences how much energy can be harvested there, can create rainfall shadows downwind, etc. Terrain can be enhanced and altered (including raising and lowering altitude!) by units equipped with a [[terraforming|terraformer]] module. The terrain also affects combat. For example, defending units receive a +50% bonus in rocky squares, while artillery units receive bonuses when attacking from higher elevation.

===Units and combat===
A unit is made up from different parts such as chassis, weapon, armor, reactor, and special ability slots. As new technologies become available, old designs may be brought up to date and existing units upgraded. 
 
Generally, only friendly units (your own or those of an ally) can occupy the same square. Enemy units must be eliminated in order to move into their square. Combat usually initiates when a unit from one faction attempts to enter a square occupied by units from another hostile faction. Many factors affect the outcome of combat, including:
*The attacking unit's weapon rating;
*The defending unit's armor rating;
*The [[hit point]]s of both units, determined by the type of reactor used;
*The morale status of both units;
*Any attack or defense bonuses brought about by base facilities and Secret Projects.

Researching certain new technologies unlocks progressively better equipment (weapons, armor and reactors.) Morale upgrades are gained through various means: possessing certain support infrastructure such as Command Centers as well as creating units with certain special abilities allows units to begin with higher morale, gaining access to the mysterious alien monoliths that dot the planet, or defeating enough enemies to gain experience will upgrade an existing units morale.

===Native Life===

Adding to the trouble of the human [[political faction|factions]] is an indigenous semi-sentient [[fungus]] (called ''xenofungus'') that spans the planet. Concentrations of xenofungus can spawn more aggressive native life forms known as ''mind worms''. Xenofungus acts as the planet's [[immune system]], and will react against heavy industrial pollution by growing over terraformed sites and concentrating multiple hostile mind worm units against offending cities. In accordance with its semi-sentience, the fungus can grow and reclaim land when the player, either through [[terraforming]] or industry, is seen as adversely affecting Planet's [[ecosystem]].

Moreover, mind worms can be captured by factions with a deep understanding of Planet's fragile ecology and used as instruments of war and police.

In the course of the storyline, it is discovered that Planet's ecosystem is an increasingly sentient [[hive mind]], which communicates with faction leaders in cut-scenes from time to time. However, contrary to the concept of a benevolent [[Mother Earth]], the planetary mind is suspicious of humans and abhors their technological intrusion on its ecological balance, often using violence to try to destroy  colonists that it perceives as a threat. Quotes by faction leaders scattered throughout the game reveal that all of them with the notable exception of Lady Dierdre consider the planetary mind to be distrustworthy, dangerous or even [[evil]], although the Transcendence victory condition allows the player to unite human consciousness with Planet's mind, thus 'civilizing' it, achieving the next step in human evolution, and granting vast [[psionic]] powers to Transcended humans.

===Bases===
[[Image:AlphaCentauriGameCD.jpg|thumb|right|The Alpha Centauri game CD ([[Microsoft Windows]] version), depicting the surface of the planet Chiron and the system's two stars]]
Bases, like cities in the earlier ''Civilization'' games, are the center of the game. A base is essentially a self-contained city that can be built and captured, as well as destroyed (either intentionally through war casualties, [[starvation]], abandonment by constructing a colonizer at base size 1, or [[weapons of mass destruction]], or unintentionally through ecological disruptions or being overrun by native mind worms).  A base collects resources from the surrounding environment, using the manpower of the local population, or mechanically through resource crawler units. [[Mineral]] resources are used in building units and maintaining their upkeep, or can be converted to energy credits. Nutrient resources feed the local citizens, with more nutrients harvested leading to a higher rate of population growth. Energy collected from [[borehole]]s or [[solar collector]]s are piped into three priorities: PSYCH, ECONOMY and LABS. PSYCH represents how much energy is being used in improving the living standard of the inhabitants. ECONOMY represents how much energy is diverted into energy credits. LABS represents how much energy is being diverted into powering research. The output of all three can be enhanced by facilities or by special inhabitants called specialists. Energy credits created by the economy are the currency of the game. It can be used in hurrying production orders, commencing secret projects, or as an object of barter in diplomatic encounters. Some covert missions or prototype construction also require energy credits. Depending on a faction's social policies and the individual base's distance from the capital, a portion of collected energy can be lost to inefficiency.

Citizens are the inhabitants of a base. One citizen represents 10,000 inhabitants. It takes one citizen to harvest the resources of one square. New citizens are produced when a base has accumulated a set quantity of excess nutrients. The amount of nutrients needed to create growth becomes higher as the population multiplies. [[Social engineering (political science)|Social engineering]] choices or facilities can help reduce this required amount during each stage of growth.

Bases build all of the faction's units, and by extension, new bases. A new base is created when a previous base builds a unit equipped with a colony pod module and the unit is deployed at the desired location. Building new units require a set amount of minerals, depending on how complex or advanced the unit is. Each turn, minerals processed by citizens are added to the current task until it is completed. This process can be hurried by spending energy credits. New technologies are also researched in a manner. LABS output from every base is accumulated each turn until it fulfils the required cost to research the technology. All of these aspects can be enhanced by facilities and other factors.

A base can also build facilities and secret projects. Facilities, which are analogous to the buildings of the original [[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]] games, creates or alters some function of the base it is located in. Similarly, Secret Projects are comparable to the [[Seven Wonders of the World|Great Wonders]] of the original [[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]. They are expensive and can only be built once, but usually have dramatic benefits ranging from free facilities to social engineering effects and special unit abilities.

===Diplomacy===
When two factions have established contact, they can engage in a variety of diplomatic actions. New technology, energy credits and bases can be bargained for or demanded with the threat of force. Factions can sign treaties and pacts, declare [[war]] or ask for a temporary cessation of hostilities. Treaties lead to [[commerce]] between faction bases and an increase in income for both factions. Pacts allow units to enter allied held territory and bases, and doubles the commerce modifier between the two factions. Computer controlled factions will remember past dealings, betrayals and atrocities, and will base their reactions to the player's diplomatic overtures accordingly.

Once one human faction has made contact with all other human factions, it can choose to convene the ''Planetary Council'' and elect a ''Planetary Governor''. Thereafter, factions can periodically convene the council (at most once every 20 years for each faction; the Planetary Governor only has to wait 10 years) to make proposals such as electing a new governor, salvaging the ''Unity'' fusion reactor core, or creating a global trade pact. With the exception of the Planetary Governor or Supreme Leader elections, each faction has one vote, with the governor holding [[veto]] power. In Planetary Governor or Supreme Leader elections, each faction casts a number of votes that is based on its total population and modifiers from secret projects.

===Society===
Despite being set in the future, the problems of human society still plague the inhabitants of Chiron. Reflecting this are the existence of drones in the population. Drones represent the undereducated, discontent segments of society. When the number of drones overwhelm the number of well educated citizens, called Talents, a drone [[riot]] occurs. During a drone riot all productive activity within the base are suspended. If not stopped, prolonged drone riots will eventually escalate in severity until facilities are destroyed, or in extreme cases, the entire city defects to another faction. 

Drone riots can be suppressed through the use of in base military units as [[police]]. The amount of suppression allowed depends on the degree of tolerance the society, under current [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] models, has for policing. There also exists the temporary and more extreme solution of ''nerve stapling''. This directly suppresses the violent tendencies of the population, preventing drone riots for a short period of time, but carrying it out is considered an atrocity and can negatively impact diplomatic reactions.

===Social Engineering===
[[Social engineering (political science)|Social engineering]] is another decisive game element reflecting human nature. Here, political, economic, social and future society models may be chosen. Each choice has its benefits and drawbacks. When combined, these models shape the faction's overall society. The aspects of social engineering affect a diverse range of gameplay elements, ranging from contentment and growth of the populace, unit morale and fighting strength, to the amount of energy credits received, among other things.

* ''[[Political systems|Politics]]'' represents the method your society uses to make political decisions.
**''[[Frontier]]'' is the default system. This politics represents the informal government used in the young colonies, before the settlement reach a substantial size, which require a more sophisticated government system.
** ''[[Police state|Police State]]'' is the system in which the government uses brutal police force to discipline the citizens and keep them in line. The leader has great power over the military and the citizens but the economic efficiency is decreased.
** ''[[democracy|Democratic]]'' is the system where the citizens take part in the government by electing their representatives. The stability this government type offers increases growth and efficiency, but the citizens become suspicious of large military deployments.
** ''[[fundamentalism|Fundamentalist]]'' is the system where the society is heavily based on a religion. This government type provides loyal citizens, and tends to make the citizens more resistant against brainwashing. However, scientific research suffers greatly under this government.
* ''Economics'' represents how your society [[economic systems|manages its resources]].
** ''[[Primitive accumulation of capital|Simple]]'' is the default administration. It represents the informal, [[ad hoc]] economic system, which is utilized in the early years after Planetfall.
** ''[[free market|Free Market]]'' is the system where the market forces are released. This system generates a lot of wealth, at the expense of severe environmental damage and unhappiness of people who are suddenly rendered poor by unscrupulous moguls.
** ''[[Planned economy|Planned]]'' is the system where the market forces are tied very tight by strict government regulations. This benefits the production and growth, at the expense of efficiency.
** ''[[Green politics|Green]]'' is government with nature preservation as its top goal. Extensive recycling increases the efficiency and reduces ecological damage, but growth is sacrificed due to deference for native life.
* ''Values'' represents which [[Value system|value system]] your society is based upon.
** ''[[Survival skills|Survival]]'' is the most important value in the early struggles of surviving on the foreign planet.
** ''[[Power]]'' is the value of having a strong leader with power to enforce his will and have large military budget. But the industry suffers from this exaggerated 'defense' budget.
** ''[[Knowledge]]'' is the society value where science and knowledge are highly prized. It promotes free flow of information, which increases scientific progress but tends to render the player's society more vulnerable to probe attacks.
** ''[[Wealth]]'' values the acquisition of money and material goods most highly.  The benefits for the economy and for industry are apparent; the morale of the society suffers, however, due to greed.
* ''[[Transhumanism|Future society]]'' represents advanced social engineering models, which can be used very late in the game after extensive research and much experience with social engineering.
** ''None'' is the default future society. This represents that the player's society has not yet developed a future society.
** ''[[Cybernetics|Cybernetic]]'' is the future society where artificial intelligence has taken over the menial tasks of society, allowing humans devote their time to creative pursuits.  Its downside is the civil unrest often caused as people have their jobs taken by machines. 
** ''[[Eudaimonia|Eudaimonic]]'' is virtue in accord with excellence: the citizens of this society achieve ultimate happiness by striving to fulfil their greatest potential.
** ''[[Thought control]]'' is the future society where mind-control methods are used to utterly subjugate the citizens of the player's society.

==Factions==
The original seven [[Political faction|factions]] in the game are as follows below (the [[Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire|Alien Crossfire]] expansion adds seven more):

===Spartan Federation===
True to their name, the Spartan faction places the highest priority on strength, discipline and combat readiness. Commanded by Colonel Corazon Santiago, a survivalist from Puerto Rico, the Spartans make planetfall with the technology ''Doctrine: Mobility''. Spartan units receive morale upgrades (making them better fighters) and their disciplined society is naturally tolerant of [[police]] actions, allowing two [[military]] units to help suppress a colony's drones. The Spartans' skilled military expertise allows them to build prototype units without extra mineral cost. However, the excessive labour developed to military production imposes a 10% penalty to industrial production. The Spartans may not pursue Wealth as a social engineering choice.  Their founding base is Sparta Command.

===Gaia's Stepdaughters===
A faction that values living in [[Ecology|ecological]] harmony with Planet and abhors ecological destruction. They are led by Lady Deirdre Skye of Scotland. The Gaians make planetfall with the technology ''Centauri Ecology''. The Gaians' ecological safeguards allow them to avoid ecological damage and to capture native mind worms, and their experience with lifecycles and recycling gives them an efficiency bonus. The Gaians also receive one extra nutrient from fungal squares and their infantry units can move through xenofungus without movement penalties. The Gaians are [[pacifism|pacifistic]] and freedom-loving, giving rise to their weaknesses: low troop morale and a lower police rating which prevents nerve stapling. The Gaians may not use a [[Free market|Free Market]] system in social engineering.  Their founding base is Gaia's Landing.

===University of Planet===
A faction that values knowledge and scientific advancement, although not necessarily ethically obtained. Led by Academician Prokhor Zakharov of Russia. The [[University]] makes planetfall with ''Information Networks'', as well as another randomly selected technology. The brilliant researchers of the University allow them to discover new technologies 20% faster than normal, but the openness of their academic networks leaves them prone to infiltration from other factions. Every University base comes equipped with a Network Node, which boosts research by another 50%. Due to the University's lack of ethics, one in every four citizens is a drone. The University may not use a [[Fundamentalist]] [[government]] in social engineering.  Their founding base is University Base.

===Peacekeeping Forces===
This faction works hard to keep the peace through diplomacy and to maintain the United Nations charter. Led by Commissioner Pravin Lal of India, the Peacekeepers make planetfall with the technology ''Biogenetics''. The [[United Nations]] style bureaucracy of the Peacekeepers causes them to lose efficiency. The Peacekeepers do attract intellectual elites, causing every fourth citizen to be a talent. The Peacekeeper colonies may grow two sizes beyond normal population restrictions. In votes for Planetary Governor and Supreme Leader, the Peacekeepers' votes are double its population. The Peacekeepers may not use a [[police state]] government in social engineering.  Their founding base is United Nations Headquarters.

===Human Hive===
A totalitarian faction based on [[Communist]]/[[Collectivist]] principles. They are controlled by Chairman Sheng-Ji Yang of China. The Hive makes planetfall with the technology ''Doctrine: Loyalty''. The Hive has its growth rate boosted by 10% and its brutal serfdom decreases the mineral cost of units and facilities by 10%, however the lack of political freedom causes each colony to generate one less unit of energy per turn. In the original version of the game, the Hives' belief in the greater good greatly raised the morale of Yang's army.  In the [[Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire|expansion pack]], the Hive loses its morale bonus but is given an immunity to inefficiency, which greatly bolsters the Police State government used by Yang, as it removes all negative side effects.  The Hive may not use a [[Democracy|Democratic]] government.  During development, this faction was named &quot;The Labyrinth&quot; and had a stronger science inclination, before being changed to &quot;The Hive&quot; in the final release.  Their founding base, fittingly, is The Hive.

===Lord's Believers===
A [[fundamentalist]] faction wary of secular technology. Led by Sister Miriam Godwinson of the United States. The Believers make planetfall with the technology ''Social Psych''. The Believers' convictions give them a 25% attack bonus as well as increasing the morale of their Probe Teams and increasing the cost of their enemies' probe attacks. Their eagerness to defend their faith allows each colony to support up to four units without a cost of minerals. Because the Believers feel that Chiron is their promised land, ecological tensions are increased and production of resources in fungal squares is decreased. The Believers are also skeptical of secular technology, thus their research rate is decreased by 20% and they may not accumulate any research points in the first ten years on Chiron. The Believers may not use Knowledge as a social engineering choice.  While the game was being coded, this faction was named &quot;The Conclave&quot; before being changed to &quot;The Believers&quot; in the final release.  Their founding base is New Jerusalem.

===Morgan Industries===
A faction stressing the values of wealth and materialism, and led by self-made mogul Nwabudike Morgan of Namibia. The Morgans make planetfall with the technology ''Industrial Base'' and an additional 100 energy credits. Because they are an industrial [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]], they receive an energy bonus in social engineering - an extra unit of energy in each colony, and one energy per square and even larger bonuses if this is combined with social engineering values such as Free Market or Wealth. However, because of the expensive tastes of its followers and the demand for creature comforts, Morganite units have high mineral maintenance costs and colonies cannot exceed population size four until the Hab Complex Facility is built. The Morganites receive extra energy from commerce due to their marketing expertise. They may not choose a Planned economy in social engineering.  Their founding base is Morgan Industries.

== Victory conditions ==

There are several victory methods available in ''Alpha Centauri''.

;Cooperative : A Cooperative victory allows multiple allied factions to win the game if one of the factions achieves one of the following methods.
;Military : A military victory occurs when all factions are annihilated or have surrendered to one player. If cooperative victory is enabled then there may be up to three pact brothers and sisters who can share the victory (excluding those who have surrendered).
;Economic : When a player has enough energy reserves (roughly equal to what it would take to mind-control all the remaining cities on planet), he or she can win the game through economic victory by cornering the global energy market. This takes 20 turns to achieve, and can be prevented if during this time the faction's headquarters falls to an enemy.
;Diplomatic : A player achieves diplomatic victory by uniting the Planetary Council behind him or her.  To do this, the player must get a certain percentage of the votes, by population, at Planetary Council.  The percentage varies based on difficulty level, up to 75% at the highest difficulty (transcendent).  If the vote succeeds but remaining factions oppose the decision, they must be eliminated by force to achieve a military victory.
;Transcendence : The transcendence victory is achieved by building the Ascent to Transcendence secret project, which becomes available after the Voice of Planet secret project has been built (by any faction).  This concept of a post human era is very closely related to the idea of the [[technological singularity]].  After this project is built the human inhabitants of Chiron leave their material bodies to merge with the emerged planet intelligence.

== Inspirations ==
They are countless but to name just a few, [[Chiron]] (the name of the planet) is the name of the only non-barbaric [[centaur]] in Greek mythology and an important loregiver and teacher for humanity. The native life and singular planet mind of the game draws heavily from [[Frank Herbert]]'s novel ''[[The Jesus Incident]]''. [[Vernon Vinge]]'s ''[[technological singularity|Singularity]]'' is the origin of the Transcendence concept.

The arrival on Chiron is referred to as &quot;Planetfall&quot;, which is a term used in many science fiction novels, including [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''Future History'' series and [[Infocom]]'s celebrated comic [[interactive fiction]] adventure ''[[Planetfall]]''.

==Influence==
While not being a direct sequel of ''[[Civilization II]]'', ''Alpha Centauri'' was considered a continuation or a successor of that much acclaimed game, because it had the same general principles as ''Civilization II'' did, and had been made by many of the same people. It was also thematically linked, as the earlier game had ended with mankind leaving Earth to travel to Alpha Centauri, the moment at which ''Alpha Centauri'' begins. ''Alpha Centauri'' was built on the ''Civilization II'' engine modified for [[voxel]] graphics. ''[[Firaxis]]'' made ''Alpha Centauri'' after ''Civilization II'' as a spiritual sequel to the series. At the time, the ''Civilization'' franchise was in dispute since [[Sid Meier]] and [[Brian Reynolds]] had left [[Microprose]] to found [[Firaxis]]. Unable to make ''[[Civilization III]]'', they made ''Alpha Centauri'', instead, beginning the game where the storyline had left off in ''Civilization''.

The magazine ''[[PC Gamer]] US'' awarded ''Alpha Centauri'' a score of 98%, which was the highest score ever given by that magazine&amp;mdash;''Civilization II'' being the previous holder of this record with 97%. In 2004, ''PC Gamer'' gave ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' a score of 98%, making it tied with ''Alpha Centauri''. The magazine also gave ''Alpha Centauri'' Editor's choice and Turn-based strategy game of the year awards in 1999.

''Alpha Centauri'' has also won several Game of the Year awards, including those from ''[[The Denver Post]]'' and ''[[Toronto Sun]]''. It won Turn-based Strategy Game of the year award from [[GameSpot]] as well. The [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] named ''Alpha Centauri'' best strategy game of the year.  In [[2000]] ''Alpha Centauri'' won the [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Strategy Computer Game of 1999''.

In the community of Civilization players, many quotations from ''Alpha Centauri'', which are shown at different points in the gameplay, are also quite popular.

The game has also sparked a trilogy of novels (see below) and a strategy guide by Chris Hartpence (&quot;Velociryx&quot;), which was later printed and published.  [[Steve Jackson Games]] also published ''GURPS Alpha Centauri'', an expansion for the [[GURPS]] [[role-playing game]] set in the Alpha Centauri universe.

==Technology==

Unlike comparable games at the time of publishing, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri employs ([[orthographic]]) [[3D computer graphics|3-D]] [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] for both the terrain and units. This is made possible by the &quot;Caviar&quot; [[voxel]] library by AnimaTek International (now [http://www.digi-element.com/ Digital Element]), which renders the voxel models and terrain geometry using self-modifying [[assembler]] routines.

==Alpha Centauri A system==
Although the details of the Alpha Centauri A system do not play much of a direct role in the game (apart from &amp;alpha; Cen B's &quot;perihelion&quot; affecting the energy harvest 20 years out of each 80), they are nevertheless documented in the game files&lt;!--- Planets.txt ---&gt;. There we learn not only of Chiron's two moons ([[Pholus]] and [[Nessus]]), but also of the mercurian planet [[Eurytion]].

==Further reading==
The original story of the journey and splintering of the colonization space ship from Earth to Alpha Centauri was detailed in multiple installments that were released periodically by Michael Ely of Firaxis on the web, immediately prior to the release of the game, as part of a marketing mechanism.  During the course of the installments, the names of regular forum members on the official Firaxis forums were incorporated into the story in cameos.

For further reading, game story developer [[Michael Ely]] has also written a trilogy of novels based on the game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG)''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: جماعة أبو سياف), or simply '''Abu Sayyaf''', also known as '''Al Harakat Al Islamiyya''', is an [[Islamist]] terrorist separatist group of based in and around the southern islands of the [[Philippines]], primarily [[Jolo]], [[Basilan]], and [[Mindanao]].
[[Image:AbuSayyaf.jpg|right|thumb|Khadaffy Janjalani with his right hand man and ASG spokesperson Abu Sabaya.]]

[[Khadaffy Janjalani]] is named as the nominal leader of the group by the Armed Forces of the [[Philippines]].

It is reported that they recently began expanding into neighbouring [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. The group has carried out [[bombing]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[kidnapping]]s, and [[extortion]] in their fight for an independent Islamic state in western [[Mindanao]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]] and create an atmosphere conducive to the creation of a Pan-Islamic superstate in the [[Malay Peninsula|Malay]] portions of [[South-east Asia]]. The name of the group is [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for ''Father (Abu) of the Sword (Sayyaf)''.

The ASG is the one of the smallest but strongest of the Islamic separatist groups in Mindanao. Some ASG members have allegedly studied or worked in [[Saudi Arabia]] and developed ties to [[mujahadeen]] while fighting and training in the war against the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. 

The [[Philippines|Philippine]] government has claimed the group has ties to [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] and [[al-Qaeda]].

A blast at a US military base in the Philippines on [[February 18]], [[2006]] was blamed on Abu Sayyaf by Brig. General Alexander Aleo, a [[United States Army]] [[Commanding officer|officer]].[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4727842.stm]

==History==

Members of the ASG were once part of the [[Moro National Liberation Front]], but started on their own in 1991 under the leadership of [[Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani]].

[[Ramzi Yousef]] and [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]], both of whom were involved with [[Operation Bojinka]], allegedly took [[scuba]] trips to [[Puerto Galera]]. The trips may have been a cover for the training of Abu Sayyaf terrorists.

After [[Ramzi Yousef]] bombed [[Philippine Airlines]] [[Philippine Airlines Flight 434|Flight 434]], killing a [[Japan]]ese passenger, a man stated in a telephone call, &quot;We are [the] Abu Sayyaf Group. We explode[d] one plane from [[Cebu]].&quot; The bombing was supposedly a test for [[Operation Bojinka]], which was discovered by [[Manila]] police on [[January 6]], [[1995]].

Abu Sayyaf's first large-scale action was the beachhead assault on the town of [[Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay|Ipil]] in [[Mindanao]] in April [[1995]]. It is responsible for the kidnapping and murder of more than 30 foreigners and Christian clerics and lay-workers.

Abdurajik Janjalani was killed in a clash with the Philippine National Police on [[December 18]], [[1998]]. Khaddafy Janjalani, his younger brother, is said to have succeeded him.

The death of Aburajik Abubakar Janjalani, otherwise known as Abu Sayyaf, marked a turning point in ASG operations, shifting from its ideological focus to more general kidnappings, murders and robberies. 
[[Image:robotx1.jpg|right|thumb|Galib Andang a.k.a Kumander Robot getting treated for injuries sustained after being captured by the Philippine military.]] 

The ASG primarily operates in the southern Philippines with members occasionally traveling to [[Manila]], but the group expanded its operations to [[Malaysia]] in 2000 when it abducted foreigners from two different resorts. A commander named [[Abu Sabaya]] was killed in 2002 while trying to evade forces.[http://www.ict.org.il/spotlight/det.cfm?id=796]. [[Galib Andang]], aka Commander Robot, was captured in [[Sulu]] in [[December]] [[2003]].

Abu Sayyaf is estimated to have a core membership of 200 with an extended membership of over 2000. The group was originally not thought to receive funding from any government, but intelligence reports from the [[United States]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Australia]] have found intermittent ties to the Indonesian [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] terrorist group.

'''Armenian''' is an [[Indo-European language]] spoken by the [[Armenians|Armenian people]] in the [[Armenia|Armenian]] Republic and also used by the [[Armenian Diaspora]]. It constitutes an independent branch of the Indo-European language family, though many Indo-Europeanists believe it forms a subgroup with the Greek and Indo-Iranian families (see Clackson 1994 for extensive discussion).

==General considerations==

Armenian is regarded as a close relative of [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]]. From the modern languages [[Greek language|Greek]] seems to be the most closely related to Armenian. Armenian shares major [[isogloss]]es with Greek, some linguists propose that the linguistic ancestors of the Armenians and Greeks were either identical or in a close contact relation. Armenian and Phrygian show no close relationship with the [[Anatolian languages]] other than borrowings. The Anatolian loan words within Armenian indicate that proto-Armenians were in contact with both [[Luwian]] speakers and with [[Hittites]]. The Classical Armenian language (often referred to as grabar, literally &quot;written (language)&quot;) imported numerous words from Middle Iranian languages, primarily [[Parthian]], and contains smaller inventories of borrowings from Greek, Syriac, Latin, and autochthonous languages such as [[Urartian language|Urartian]]. Middle Armenian (11th–15th centuries AD) incorporated further loans from Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and Latin, and the modern dialects took in hundreds of additional words from Modern Turkish and Persian. The two modern literary dialects, Western (originally associated with writers in the Ottoman Empire) and Eastern (originally associated with writers in the Russian Empire), removed almost all of their Turkish lexical influences in the 20th century, primarily following the genocide of the Armenians in Anatolia by the Turks in 1915–1920.

Armenian is written in the [[Armenian alphabet]], created by Saint [[Saint Mesrob|Mesrop Mashtots]] in [[406]] AD. This alphabet, with two additional letters, is still used today.

Literature written in Armenian appeared by the [[5th century]]. The written language of that time, called [[classical Armenian]] or [[Grabar]], remained the Armenian literary language, with various changes, until the 19th century. Meanwhile, spoken Armenian developed independently of the written language. Many dialects appeared when Armenian communities became separated by geography or politics, and not all of these dialects remained mutually intelligible.

==Grammar==
Armenian resembles other Indo-European languages in its structure, but it shares distinctive sounds and features of its grammar with neighboring languages of the [[Caucasus]] region. Armenian is rich in combinations of consonants. Both classical Armenian and the modern spoken and literary dialects have a complicated system of declining nouns, with six or seven noun cases but no gender. In modern Armenian the use of auxiliary verbs to show tense (comparable to will in &quot;he will go&quot;) has generally supplemented the inflected verbs of classical Armenian. Negative verbs are conjugated differently from positive ones (as in English &quot;he goes&quot; and &quot;he does not go&quot;). Grammatically, early forms of Armenian had much in common with classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], but the modern language, like modern Greek, has undergone many transformations. 

[[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] studied the Armenian language. He helped to compile an Armenian grammar textbook and translated a few Armenian books into English.

==Phonology==
[[Classical Armenian]] distinguishes seven vowels: 
''a'', ''i'', ''[[schwa]]'', open ''e'', closed ''e'', ''o'', and ''u'' (transcribed as ''a'', ''i'', ''ə'', ''e'', ''ē'', ''o'', ''ow'' and ''u'' respectively).

The [[stop consonant|occlusives]] have a special aspirated series (transcribed with a Greek ''[[spiritus asper]]'' after the letter): ''{{unicode|p῾}}'', ''{{unicode|t῾}}'', ''{{unicode|c῾}}'', ''{{unicode|č῾}}'', ''{{unicode|k῾}}''.

==Morphology==

===Noun===
Classical Armenian has no [[grammatical gender]], not even in the pronoun. The nominal inflection, however, preserves several types of inherited stem classes. The noun may take seven cases, [[nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[locative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[ablative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]].

===Verb===
''Main article: [[Armenian verbs]]''

Verbs in Armenian have an expansive system of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] with two main verb types (three in Western Armenian) changing form based on tense, mood and aspect.

==Dialects==
One of the greatest differences in the two modern dialects is the way certain letters are pronounced. Eastern Armenian speakers have kept the original pronunciations of the letters, pronouncing each of the 38 letters quite distinctively.  On the other hand, Western Armenian speakers pronounce a few of the letters in the same way.  This has to do with Western Armenians living in regions where other languages, which lacked these rich variations, were also widely spoken and therefore have been influenced by the pronunciations of these other languages (usually either Arabic or Turkish.)

For example, the Armenian language has the letter &quot;t&quot; ({{Hayeren|թ}}), aspirated as in &quot;tiger&quot;, the letter &quot;d&quot; ({{Hayeren|դ}}) as in &quot;develop&quot;, and another letter which is an unaspirated voiceless stop, sounding somewhere between the two as in &quot;s'''t'''op&quot; ({{Hayeren|տ}}).  Western Armenians will pronounce the &quot;tiger&quot; and &quot;develop&quot; examples in the same way, where as Eastern Armenian speakers pronounced each of the three differently.

Armenian also has many other unique letters not heard in other languages. There are two different &quot;k&quot;s; as well as a letter sounding like a cross between &quot;p&quot; and &quot;b&quot;; two &quot;r&quot; letters, one pronounced with a rolling &quot;r&quot; sound; the letter &quot;gh&quot; pronounced like the French &quot;r&quot;; &quot;kh&quot; a harder pronunciation also found in many Middle Eastern languages; as well as the letters &quot;ts&quot;, &quot;tz&quot;, &quot;dz&quot;, &quot;dch&quot;, &quot;uh&quot; like the &quot;a&quot; sound in the word &quot;arrange&quot;; and many more.  These are just a few examples that make Armenian a rich and unique language.

There is no precise linguistic border between one dialect and another because there is nearly always a dialect transition zone of some size between pairs of geographically identified dialects). The main difference between both blocks are:
*'''Western Armenian''' (''Arevm'tahayeren''):
** example
*'''Eastern Armenian''' (''Arevelahayeren''):
** example

In addition, neither dialect is completely homogeneous: any dialect can be subdivided into several subdialects. Armenian can be subdivided in two major dialectal blocks and those blocks into individual dialects, though many of the Western Armenian dialects have died due to the effects of the Armenian Genocide:

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Additive synthesis''' is a technique of audio synthesis which creates [[music]]al [[timbre]].

The timbre of an instrument is composed of multiple [[harmonic]]s, in different quantities, that change over time. Additive synthesis emulates such timbres by creating numerous waveforms pitched to different harmonics, with a different [[amplitude]] envelope on each, along with non-harmonic artifacts.

Usually this involves a bank of [[numerically controlled oscillator|oscillators]] tuned to multiples of the base frequency. Often, each oscillator has its own customizable volume envelope, creating a realistic, dynamic sound.

The concept behind additive synthesis may be related to discoveries by the French  mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]].  Fourier discovered that discontinuous functions are formed by the summation of an infinite series.  Following this, it was established that all signals, when represented as a mathematical function, can be composed as a sum of sine functions ( sin(''x'') ) of various frequencies.  More rigorously, any periodic sound in the [[discrete time]] domain can be synthesized as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;s(n) = \frac{1}{2} a_0(n) + \sum_{k=1}^{k_{\max}} a_k(n) \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi f_0}{F_s} k n \right)-b_k(n) \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi f_0}{F_s} k n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;s(n) = \frac{1}{2} a_0(n) + \sum_{k=1}^{k_{\max}} r_k(n) \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi f_0}{F_s} k n +\varphi_k(n) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;a_k(n) = r_k(n) \cos \left( \varphi_k(n) \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;b_k(n) = r_k(n) \sin \left( \varphi_k(n) \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;F_s \,&lt;/math&gt; is the sampling frequency, &lt;math&gt;f_0 \,&lt;/math&gt; is the fundamental frequency, and &lt;math&gt;k_{\max}&lt;\operatorname{floor}(F_s/2 f_0) \,&lt;/math&gt; is the highest harmonic and below the [[Nyquist frequency]].   The [[direct current|DC]] term is generally undesirable in audio synthesis, so the a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; term can be removed.  Introducing time varying coefficients ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') allows for the dynamic use of envelopes to modulate oscillators creating a &quot;quasi-periodic&quot; waveform (one that is periodic over the short term but changes its waveform over the longer term).  Additive synthesis can also create non-[[harmonic]] sounds if the individual [[partial]]s are not all having a frequency that is an integer multiple of the same [[fundamental frequency]].

A classic additive synthesizer was the [[Synclavier]].  The pipe organ may also qualify as an additive synthesizer because its pipes generate sine waves when blown, which are  added to each other to generate tones.  More contemporary popular implementations of additive synthesis include the [[Kawai]] K5000 series of synthesizers in the [[1990s]] and, more recently, [[software synthesizer]]s such as the [[Camel Audio]] Cameleon, the [[VirSyn]] Cube, [[White Noise]] WNAdditive, and the [[ConcreteFX]] softsynth Adder. 

It has been shown in [http://www.musicdsp.org/files/Wavetable-101.pdf Wavetable Synthesis 101, A Fundamental Perspective], that [[wavetable synthesis]] is equivalent to additive synthesis in the case that all [[partial]]s or [[overtone]]s are [[harmonic]] (that is all overtones are at frequencies that are an integer multiple of a [[fundamental frequency]] of the tone as shown in the equation above).  Not all musical sounds have harmonic partials, (e.g. [[bell (instrument) | bell]]s) but many do.  In these cases, an efficient implementation of additive synthesis can be accomplished with wavetable synthesis.  '''Group additive synthesis''' is a method to group partials into harmonic groups (of differing fundamental frequencies) and synthesize each group separately with wavetable synthesis before mixing the results.

An '''aircraft carrier''' is a [[warship]] whose main role is to deploy and recover [[aircraft]]&amp;mdash;in effect acting as a sea-going airbase. Aircraft carriers thus allow a naval force to project [[air power]] great distances without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. Modern navies who operate such ships, treat aircraft carriers as the centerpiece of the fleet, a role previously played by the [[battleship]]. The change, part of the growth of air power as a significant part of warfare, took place during [[World War II]]. Unescorted carriers are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines or missiles and therefore travel as part of a [[carrier battle group]].  In many navies, especially the [[United States Navy]], an aircraft carrier is a [[capital ship]].

==Flight deck configuration==
[[Image:Enterprise Returns.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The island of [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'']].]]

Modern aircraft carriers have a flat-top deck, the [[flight deck]] that serves as a [[take off|take-off]] and [[landing]] area for aircraft. Aircraft take off to the front, into the wind, and land from the rear. Carriers steam at speed, for example up to 35 [[knot (nautical)|knots]] (65 km/h), into the wind during take-off in order to increase the [[apparent wind]] speed, thereby reducing the speed of the aircraft relative to the ship. On some ships, a steam-powered [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] is used to propel the aircraft forward assisting the power of its engines and allowing it to take off in a shorter distance than would otherwise be required, even with the headwind effect of the ship's course. On other carriers, aircraft do not require assistance for take off — the requirement for assistance relates to aircraft design and performance. Conversely, when landing on a carrier, some aircraft rely upon a [[tailhook]] that catches on [[arrestor wires]] stretched across the deck to bring them to a stop in a shorter distance than normal. Other aircraft utilise their hover capability to land vertically and so require no assistance in speed reduction upon landing. Since the end of [[World War II]] it has been common to direct the landing recovery area off to port at an angle to the line of the ship. The primary function of the angle deck landing area is to allow aircraft who miss the arresting wires, refered to as a &quot;bolter&quot;, to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked on the forward parts of the deck. The angle deck also allows launching of aircraft at the same time as others land.

The above deck areas of the warship (the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]], flight [[control tower]], engine exhausts and so on) are concentrated to the [[starboard]] side of the deck in a relatively small area called an &quot;island&quot;.  Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island and such a configuration has not been seen in a fleet sized carrier.

A more recent configuration, used by the [[Royal Navy]], has a 'ski-jump' ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was developed to help launch [[VTOL]] (or [[STOVL]]) aircraft (aircraft that are able to take off and land with little or no forward movement) such as the [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]]. Although the aircraft are capable of flying vertically off the deck, using the ramp is more fuel efficient. As catapults and arrestor cables are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for equipment.

==Common types==
Over the course of the last century there have been several types of aircraft carrier, some of which are now obsolete. They can be generally categorised as follows:

===Initial designs and inter-war developments===
* [[Seaplane tender]]s, such as [[HMS Engadine (1911)|HMS ''Engadine'']], out of frontline use after the 1920s when carriers capable of handling conventional airplanes came into fleets and the superiority of landplanes over [[seaplane]]s in naval operations became firmly established.
* Standard carriers, such as [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']], typically 20,000 to 65,000 tons. Often known as &quot;fleet carriers.&quot;
* Flying aircraft carrier; airship that can carry aircraft. Example include [[USS Akron (ZRS-4)|USS ''Akron'']] and [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|''Macon'']]

===World War II developments===
[[Image:Hmcs bonaventure.jpg|250px|right||thumb|[[HMCS Bonaventure (CVL 22)|HMCS ''Bonaventure'']], a [[Majestic class aircraft carrier|''Majestic'' class]] aircraft carrier of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]].]]

* [[Escort carrier]]s, such as [[USS Barnes (CVE-20)|USS ''Barnes'']], were built only during World War II, and were used by the Royal Navy and U.S. Navy. 
* [[Light aircraft carrier]]s, such as [[USS Independence (CVL-22)|USS ''Independence'']], were designed to primarily carry fighters.
* [[CAM ship]]s, such as [[SS Michael E|SS ''Michael E'']], cargo carrying merchant ships which could launch but not retrieve fighter aircraft. These vessels were an emergency measure during [[World War II]].
* [[Merchant aircraft carrier]]s (MACs), such as [[MV Empire MacAlpine|MV ''Empire MacAlpine'']], another emergency measure which saw cargo-carrying merchant ships equipped with flight decks.
* [[Carrier battleship]]s were created by the Imperial Japanese Navy to partially compensate for the loss of carrier strength at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]]. Two of them were made from [[Ise class battleship|''Ise'' class]] battleships during late 1943. The aft turrets were removed and replaced with a hangar, deck and catapult.  The heavy cruiser [[Mogami|''Mogami'']] concurrently received a similar conversion. 
* [[Submarine aircraft carrier]]s, such as the French [[French submarine Surcouf|''Surcouf'']], or the Japanese [[I-400 class submarine]]s which were capable of carrying 3 [[Aichi]] [[Aichi M6A|M6A ''Seiran'']] aircraft. The first of these were built in the 1920s.

In addition, many battleships, cruisers and merchant raiders were equipped with floatplanes for reconnaissance.

===Post-war developments===
* [[Amphibious assault ship|Amphibious assault carrier]]s, such as [[USS Tarawa (LHA-1)|USS ''Tarawa'']], which often also serve the purpose of carrying and landing [[soldier]]s and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose. Also known as &quot;commando carriers&quot; or &quot;helicopter carriers.&quot;
* [[Anti-submarine warfare carrier]]s, such as [[HMS Ocean (L12)|HMS ''Ocean'']], also known as &quot;helicopter carriers.&quot;
* [[Supercarrier]]s, such as [[USS Nimitz (CVN-68)|USS ''Nimitz'']], typically 75,000 tons or greater.

Some [[cruiser (warship)|cruisers]] and [[capital ship]]s of the inter-war years often carried a catapult launched seaplane for reconnaissance and spotting the fall of the guns. It was launched by a catapult and recovered by crane from the water after landing. These were mostly removed during World War II, but had some notable successes early in the war as shown by [[HMS Warspite (1913)|HMS ''Warspite'']]’s [[Supermarine Walrus|Walrus]] during operations in the Norwegian fjords in 1940.

Many modern warships have [[helicopter]] landing capability and helicopter assault ships represent a new form of amphibious assault carrier.

==History and milestones==
===Genesis===
[[Image:Ely-takeoff.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Ely takes off from&lt;br&gt;USS ''Birmingham'', [[14 November]] [[1910]].]]
[[Image:Ely-landing.jpg|thumb|200px|Ely lands on USS ''Pennsylvania'', &lt;br&gt;[[18 January]] [[1911]].]]
As heavier-than-air aircraft developed in the early 20th century various navies began to take an interest in their potential use as scouts for their big gun warships. A number of experimental flights were made to test the concept. [[Eugene Ely]] was the first [[Aviator|pilot]] to launch from a stationary ship in November 1910. He took off from a structure fixed over the forecastle of the US [[armoured cruiser]] [[USS Birmingham (CL-2)|USS ''Birmingham'']] at [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]] and landed nearby on [[Willoughby Spit]] after some five minutes in the air. On [[January 18]] [[1911]] he became the first pilot to land on a stationary ship. He took off from the Tanforan racetrack and landed on a similar temporary structure on the aft of [[USS Pennsylvania (ACR-4)|USS ''Pennsylvania'']] anchored at the [[San Francisco]] waterfront&amp;mdash;the improvised braking system of sandbags and ropes lead directly to the arrestor hook and wires described above. His aircraft was then turned around and he was able to take off again. [[Commander]] Charles Samson, RN, became the first airman to take off from a moving warship on [[May 2]] [[1912]]. He took off in a [[Short S27]] from the battleship [[HMS Hibernia (1905)|HMS ''Hibernia'']] while she steamed at 10.5 knots (19 km/h) during the [[Royal Fleet Review]] at [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]].

[[HMS Ark Royal (1914)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] was the first aircraft carrier. She was originally laid down as a merchant ship, but was converted on the building stocks to be a seaplane carrier. Launched in 1914, she served in the [[Dardanelles]] campaign and throughout World War I. 

The first strike from a carrier against a land target took place on [[July 19]] [[1918]]. Seven [[Sopwith Camel]]s launched from [[HMS Furious (1916)|HMS ''Furious'']] attacked the German [[Zeppelin]] base at [[Tondern]], with two 50 lb bombs each. Several [[airship]]s and [[balloon]]s were destroyed, but as the carrier had no method of recovering the aircraft safely, two of the pilots ditched their aircraft in the sea alongside the carrier while the others headed for neutral [[Denmark]].

===The inter-war years===
[[Image:H42235.jpg|thumb|left|150px|left|The first flat deck, [[HMS Argus (I49)|HMS ''Argus'']] in 1918]]
[[Image:Japanese aircraft carrier Hosho.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first purpose-designed aircraft carrier, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hosho|''Hosho'']], in 1922]]
The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922 placed strict limits on the tonnages of battleships and [[battlecruiser]]s for the major naval powers after [[World War I]], as well as limits not only on the total tonnage for carriers, but also an upper limit on 27,000 tonnes for each ship. Although exceptions were made regarding the max ship tonnage (fleet units counted, experimental units did not), the total tonnage could not be exceeded. However, while all of the major navies were over-tonnage on battleships, they were all considerably under-tonnage on aircraft carriers. Consequently, many battleships and battlecruisers under construction (or in service) were converted into aircraft carriers. The first ship to have a full length flat deck was [[HMS Argus (1917)|HMS ''Argus'']] the conversion of which was completed in September [[1918]], with the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] not following suit until 1920, when the conversion of [[USS Langley (CV-1)|USS ''Langley'']] had completed.  The first American fleet carriers would not join the service until [[Lexington class aircraft carrier|1928]] ([[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'']] and [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|''Saratoga'']]).

The first purpose-designed aircraft carrier to be developed was the [[HMS Hermes (1923)|HMS ''Hermes'']], although the first one to be commissionned was the Japanese [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hosho|''Hosho'']] (commissioned in December 1922, followed by HMS ''Hermes'' in July 1923). ''Hermes''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; design preceded and influenced that of the Hosho, and its construction actually began earlier, but numerous tests, experiments and budget considerations delayed its commission.

By the late 1930s, aircraft carriers around the world typically carried three types of aircraft: [[torpedo bomber]]s, also used for conventional bombings and [[reconnaissance]]; [[dive bomber]]s, also used for reconnaissance (in the U.S. Navy, this type of aircraft were known as &quot;scout bombers&quot;); and [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]s for fleet defence and bomber escort duties. Because of the restricted space on aircraft carriers, all these aircraft were of small, single-engined types, usually with [[folding wing]]s to facilitate storage.

===The Second World War===
Aircraft carriers played a significant role in [[World War II]]. With seven aircraft carriers afloat, the Royal Navy had a considerable numerical advantage at the start of the war as neither the Germans or the Italians had carriers of their own. However, the vulnerability of carriers to traditional battleships was quickly illustrated by the sinking of [[HMS Glorious|HMS ''Glorious'']] by German battlecruisers during the Norwegian campaign in 1940. By World War II, seaplane carriers were no longer considered to be equals to carriers which could operate conventional aircraft, as conventional planes could fly farther, faster, with heavier weapons loads and greater performance; by the end of the war, early helicopters were taking over many of the roles of seaplanes.

This apparent weakness to battleships was turned on its head in November 1940 when [[HMS Illustrious (R87)|HMS ''Illustrious'']] launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at [[Battle of Taranto|Taranto]]. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships in the harbour at a cost of two of the 21 attacking [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bombers]]. Carriers also played a major part in reinforcing [[Malta]], both by transporting planes and by defending convoys sent to supply the besieged island. The use of carriers prevented the Italian Navy and land-based German aircraft from dominating the Mediterranean theatre.

In the Atlantic, aircraft from HMS ''Ark Royal'' and [[HMS Victorious (R38)|HMS ''Victorious'']] were responsible for slowing [[German Battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] during May 1941. Later in the war, escort carriers proved their worth guarding convoys crossing the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic]] and [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic]] oceans.

Many of the major battles in the Pacific involved aircraft carriers. [[Japan]] started the war with ten aircraft carriers, the largest and most modern carrier fleet in the world at that time. There were six American aircraft carriers at the beginning of the hostilities, although only 3 of them were operating in the Pacific.

[[Image:Carrier shokaku.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Planes from the Japanese aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shokaku|''Shokaku'']] preparing the attack on [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]].]]

Drawing on the 1939 Japanese development of low-depth runs for aerial torpedoes, and the 1940 British aerial attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto the 1941 Japanese surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] was a clear illustration of the [[power projection]] capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Simultaneously, the Japanese began their advance through South East Asia and the [[sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']] by Japanese land-based aircraft drove home the need for this ship class for fleet defence from aerial attack. In April 1942, the Japanese Fast Carrier Strike Force ranged into the [[Indian Ocean raid|Indian Ocean]] and sank shipping, including the under-repair and undefended carrier [[HMS Hermes (95)|HMS ''Hermes'']]. Smaller Allied fleets with inadequate aerial protection were forced to retreat or be destroyed. In the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]], US and Japanese fleets traded aircraft strikes in the first battle where neither side's ships sighted the other. At the [[Battle of Midway]] four Japanese carriers were sunk in a surprise attack by planes from three American carriers and this is considered to be the turning point of the war in the Pacific.

Subsequently the US was able to build up large numbers of aircraft aboard a mixture of fleet, light and (newly commissioned) escort carriers. These carriers played a major part in winning the [[Pacific war]]. The eclipse of the battleship as the primary component of a fleet was clearly illustrated by the sinking of the largest battleship ever built, [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], by carrier-borne aircraft in 1945. Japan also built the largest aircraft carrier of the war, [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano|''Shinano'']], which, like ''Yamato'', was named after a Japanese province.

==Wartime innovations==
[[Image:Viraat lengthy.jpg|thumb|250px|[[India]]'s [[INS Viraat|INS ''Viraat'']].]]

Combat experience proved that the British invention of the sealed &quot;hurricane bow&quot; which protected against storms was superior to any other use for the very front of the ship, be it machine-guns or a second flight deck. This became standard for British and American carriers. The Japanese carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Taiho|''Taiho'']] was the first of their ships to incorporate it.

Starting late in the war with the [[Midway class aircraft carrier|''Midway'' class]], American carriers had grown so large that it was no longer practical to continue the concept of designing the hangar deck to be the strength deck, and all subsequent American carriers have the flight deck as the strength deck, leaving only the island as superstructure.

===Light Aircraft Carriers===
The loss of three major carriers in quick succession in the Pacific led the US Navy to develop the light carrier (CVL) from [[light cruiser]] hulls that had already been laid down. These were intended to add fighter squadrons to a task force, and were used in the US Navy only during World War II. The Royal Navy made a similar design which served both them and [[Commonwealth]] countries after World War II. One of these carriers, India's [[INS Viraat|INS ''Viraat'']], formerly [[HMS Hermes (R12)|HMS ''Hermes'']], is still being used.

===Escort Carriers and Merchant Aircraft Carriers===
To protect Atlantic [[convoy]]s, the British developed what they called [[Merchant Aircraft Carrier]]s, which were merchant ships equipped with a flat deck for half a dozen aircraft. These operated with civilian crews, under merchant colors, and carried their normal cargo besides providing air support for the convoy. As there was no lift or hangar, aircraft maintenance was limited and the aircraft spent the entire trip sitting on the deck.

These served as stop-gap until dedicated [[escort carrier]]s could be built in the US (US classification ''CVE''). About a third of the size of a fleet carrier, it carried about two dozen aircraft for anti-submarine duties. Over one hundred were built or converted from merchantmen.

Escort carriers were built in the US from two basic hull designs: one from a merchant ship, and the other from a slightly larger, slightly faster tanker. Besides defending convoys, these were used to transport aircraft across the ocean. Nevertheless, some participated in the battles to liberate the [[Philippines]], notably the [[battle off Samar]] in which six escort carriers and their escorting destroyers briefly took on five Japanese battleships and bluffed them into retreating.

===Catapult Aircraft Merchantmen===
As an emergency stop-gap before sufficient merchant aircraft carriers became available, the British provided air cover for convoys using ''Catapult aircraft merchantman'' (CAM ships) and [[merchant aircraft carrier]]s. CAM ships were merchant vessels equipped with an aircraft, usually a battle-weary [[Hawker Hurricane]], launched by a catapult. Once launched, the aircraft could not land back on the deck and had to ditch in the sea if it was not within range of land. Over two years, fewer than 10 launches were ever made, yet these flights did have some success: 6 bombers for the loss of a single pilot.

===The Angled Deck===
During the Second World War, aircraft would land on the flight deck parallel to the long axis of the ship's [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]. Aircraft which had already landed would be parked on the deck at the bow end of the flight deck. A crash barrier was raised behind them to stop any landing aircraft which overshot the landing area because its landing hook missed the arrestor cables. If this happened, it would often cause serious damage or injury and even, if the crash barrier was not strong enough, destruction of parked aircraft. 

An important development of the 1940s was the British invention of the angled deck, where the runway was canted at an angle of a few degrees across the ship. If an aircraft misses the arrestor cables, the pilot only needs to increase [[engine]] power to maximum to get airborne again and will not hit the parked aircraft because the angled deck points out over the sea. The picture of [[USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74)|USS ''John C. Stennis'']] at the top shows an angled landing deck.

===Post-War Developments===
[[Image:FS CdG Optics.jpg|thumb|250px|Landing optics of ''[[FS Charles de Gaulle|Charles de Gaulle]]'']]

The modern steam-powered catapult, powered by steam from the ship's [[boiler]]s or reactors, was invented by Commander C.C. Mitchell [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNVR]]. It was widely adopted following trials on [[HMS Perseus (R51)|HMS ''Perseus'']] between 1950 and 1952 which showed it to be more powerful and reliable than the compressed air catapults which had been introduced in the 1930s. As now only [[nuclear power|nuclear powered]] carriers have boilers as part of their motive power system, the majority of aircraft carriers are now equipped with steam generating plant solely to power the catapults.

Another British invention was the glide-slope indicator (also known as a &quot;meatball&quot;). This was a gyroscopically-controlled lamp on the port side of the deck which could be seen by the aviator who was about to land, indicating to him whether he was too high or too low in relation to the desired glidepath. It also took into account the effect of the waves on the flight deck. The device became a necessity as the landing speed of aircraft increased.

The US Navy prematurely attempted to become a strategic nuclear force with the project to build [[USS United States (CVA-58)|''United States'']], termed CVA, with the &quot;A&quot; signifying &quot;atomic&quot;. This ship would have carried twin-propeller bombers, each of which could carry an atomic bomb. The project was cancelled under pressure from the newly-created [[United States Air Force]], and the letter &quot;A&quot; was re-cycled to mean &quot;attack.&quot; But this only delayed the growth of carriers. Nuclear weapons would put to sea despite Air Force objections in 1955 aboard [[USS Forrestal (CV-59)|USS ''Forrestal'']], and by the end of the fifties the Navy had a series of nuclear-armed attack aircraft.

The US Navy took nuclear power afloat in other ways by building aircraft carriers powered by nuclear reactors. [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'']] was the first aircraft carrier to be powered in this way and subsequent supercarriers took advantage of this technology to increase their endurance. The only other nation to have followed the US lead is France with [[FS Charles de Gaulle|''Charles de Gaulle'']].

The post-war years also saw the development of the helicopter with different capabilities to a fighter aircraft. Whereas fixed-wing aircraft are suited to air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack, helicopters are used to transport equipment and personnel and can be used in an [[anti-submarine warfare]] role with dipped sonar and missiles.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the UK converted some of its old carriers into Commando Carriers, sea-going helicopter airfields like [[HMS Bulwark (R08)|HMS ''Bulwark'']]. To militate against the expensive connotations of the term &quot;aircraft carrier&quot;, the new [[Invincible class aircraft carriers|''Invincible'' class]] carriers were originally designated &quot;through deck cruisers&quot; and were initially helicopter only craft to operate as escort carriers. The arrival of the Sea Harrier meant they could carry fixed wing aircraft despite their short flight deck.

==Aircraft carriers today==
[[Image:FlightOps launch.jpg|thumb|200px|Flight operations on the deck of [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']].]]
Aircraft carriers are generally the largest ships operated by [[Navy|navies]]; a ''Nimitz''-class carrier powered by two [[nuclear reactor]]s and four [[steam turbine]]s is 1092 ft (333 m) long and costs about $10 billion. The United States has the majority of aircraft carriers with a dozen in service, and its aircraft carriers are a cornerstone of American power projection capability.

Ten countries maintain aircraft carriers: [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[India]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Brazil]], [[Italy]] and [[Thailand]]. In addition the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] possesses the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aircraft carrier [[Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag|''Varyag'']], but most naval analysts believe that they have no intention to operate it, but instead are using ''Varyag'' to learn about carrier operations for a future Chinese aircraft carrier. Canada, China, Japan, [[Pakistan]], [[Australia]] and [[Chile]] also operate helicopter-carrying vessels.

Aircraft carriers are generally accompanied by a number of other ships, to provide protection for the relatively unwieldy carrier, to carry supplies, and to provide additional offensive capabilities. This is often termed a battle group or carrier group, sometimes a carrier battle group.

===Modern carriers===
[[Image:HMS Hermes (R12) (Royal Navy aircraft carrier.jpg|thumb|200px|HMS ''Hermes'']]
More modern uses of aircraft carriers include the [[Falklands War]], where the United Kingdom was able to win a conflict 8,000 miles (13,000 km) from home in large part due to the use of the full size carrier HMS ''Hermes'' and the smaller [[HMS Invincible (R05)|HMS ''Invincible'']]. The Falklands showed the value of a [[VSTOL]] aircraft&amp;mdash;the [[Hawker-Siddeley Harrier]] (the RN Sea Harrier and press-ganged RAF Harriers) in defending the fleet and assault force from shore based aircraft and for attacking the enemy. Helicopters from the carriers were used to deploy troops and pick up the wounded. 

The US has also made use of carriers in the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Afghanistan]] and to protect its interests in the Pacific. Most recently, the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] featured US aircraft carriers as the primary base of US air power. Even without the ability to place significant numbers of aircraft in Middle Eastern airbases, the United States was capable of carrying out significant air attacks from carrier-based squadrons.

In the early 21st century, worldwide aircraft carriers were capable of carrying about 1250 aircraft. US carriers accounted for over 1000 of these; the second leading country, the United Kingdom fielded over 50 aircraft. The United Kingdom and France are both undergoing a major expansion in carrier capability (with a [[Royal Navy CVF programme|common ship class]]), but the United States will still maintain a very large lead.

&lt;p clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

==Future aircraft carriers==
Several nations which currently possess aircraft carriers are in the process of planning new classes, to replace current ones. 

===French ''Marine Nationale''===
The [[French Navy]] has set in motion plans for a [[Future French aircraft carrier|second aircraft carrier]], to supplement ''[[FS Charles de Gaulle|Charles de Gaulle]]''. The design is to be much larger, in the range of 50&amp;ndash;60,000 tonnes, and will not be nuclear-powered like Charles de Gaulle. There are plans to adopt the current [[Royal Navy CVF programme|Royal Navy design]] for [[CATOBAR]] operations (the [[Thales Group|Thales]]/[[BAE Systems]] design for the Royal Navy is for a STOVL carrier which is reconfigureable to CATOBAR operations).

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Gorshkov-01-model.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A model of [[Admiral Gorshkov]] after reconfiguration.]] --&gt;

India started the construction of a 37,500 tonne, 252 metre-long aircraft carrier in April [[2005]]. The new carrier will cost US$762 million and will operate [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG 29K 'Fulcrum']] and Sea Harrier aircraft along with Russian- and Indian-made helicopters. The ship will be powered by four turbine engines and when completed will have a range of 7,500 nautical miles, carrying 160 officers, 1400 sailors, and 30 aircraft. The carrier is to be constructed by a state-run shipyard in southern India. In 2004, India also bought [[Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov|''Admiral Gorshkov'']] from [[Russia]] for US$1.5 billion; it is expected to join the [[Indian Navy|Indian Navy]] in 2008 after a refit.{{ref|India}}

===Italian ''Marina Militare''===
The construction of the conventional powered ''[[Marina Militare]]'' V/STOL aircraft carrier [[Cavour (C552)|''Cavour'']] began in 2001. It is being built by [[Fincantieri]] of Italy. After much delay, ''Cavour'' is expected to enter service in 2008  to complement the Marina Militare aircraft carrier [[Italian aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi|''Giuseppe Garibaldi'']]. A second aircraft carrier in the 25-30,000 ton range is much desired by the Italian Navy, to replace the already decommissioned carrier [[Italian aircraft carrier Vittorio Veneto|''Vittorio Veneto'']], but for budgetary reasons all further development is on hold.

===People's Republic of China===
In June 2005, it was reported by boxun.com that [[China]] would build a US$362 million aircraft carrier with a displacement of 78,000 tons, to be built by the Jiangnan Shipyard in [[Shanghai]]. The report was denied by Chinese defense official ''Zhang Guangqin''. {{ref|China}} Previous attempts to purchase an aircraft carrier from Russia and France did not succeed.

===British Royal Navy===
[[Image:2006 CVF STOVL.jpg|thumb|200px|Royal Navy CVF]]
The Royal Navy is currently planning two new larger aircraft carriers (as yet only known as [[Royal Navy CVF programme|CVF]]) to replace the two [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible'' class]] carriers currently in service. These two ships are expected to be named [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (2012)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] and [[HMS Prince of Wales (2015)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']]. They will be able to operate about 50 aircraft and will have a displacement of around 60,000 tonnes. The two ships are due to enter service in 2012 and 2015 respectively. Their primary aircraft complement will be made up of [[F-35 Joint Strike Fighter]], and their ship's company will number around 1000.

The two ships will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy. Initially to be configured for STOVL operations, the carriers are to be adaptable to allow any type of future generation of aircraft to operate from them.

===Russian Federation===
Has one operational aircraft carrier, [[Soviet aircraft carrier Kuznetsov | ''Admiral Kuznetsov'']]. [[Image:Carrier_Admiral_Kuznetsov.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Russian ''Admiral Kuznetsov'']]

The Russian Federation is currently developing a new aircraft carrier design. They are starting from scratch to make a modern model, with the newest available materials and electronics. Requirements would be for two aircraft carriers - one for the Russian Baltic Fleet and one for the Russian Pacific Fleet. Construction is set to begin by 2010, and finish in around 6 years.

===Spanish ''Armada Española''===
[[Image:buqueproyeccionestrategica.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Spanish ''Buque de proyección estratégica'']]
The project for the 231 meter-long and 25,000-30,000 tons conventional powered ''[[Buque de Proyección Estratégica]]'' (Strategic projection vessel) for the Spanish navy was approved in 2003, and its construction started in August 2005, with the ship-building firm [[Navantia]] in charge of the project. The ''Buque de proyección estratégica'' is a vessel designed to operate both as [[amphibious assault]] vessel and as VSTOL aircraft carrier, depending on the mission assigned. The design was made keeping in mind the low-intensity conflicts in which the Spanish Armada is going to be involved in the future. When it is configured to operate as VSTOL aircraft carrier, the operating range will be about 25,000 tons, and it will operate a maximum of 20 [[AV-8B Harrier II|Matador AV-8B+]], F-35 or a mixed force of both aircraft. The ship is provided with a Sky-Jump and a tri-dimensional radar based combat system, and she will be the second operating aircraft carrier of the Spanish navy after [[Spanish aircraft carrier Principe de Asturias|''Príncipe de Asturias'']].

===US Navy===
[[Image:Image-CVNX picture.JPG|200px|thumb|right|CVNX/CVN-21]]

The current US Fleet of [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class]] carriers are to be followed into service (and in some cases replaced) by the [[CVN-21]]/CVNX Carrier. It is expected that the ships will be larger and will operate more aircraft than the 80 or so of [[USS Nimitz|''Nimitz'']], and will also be designed for lower detectability by radar.

The '''Apicomplexa''' are a large group of [[protozoa]], characterized by the presence of an apical complex at some point in their life-cycle.  They are exclusively parasitic, and completely lack [[flagellum|flagella]] or [[pseudopod]]s except for certain [[gamete]] stages.  Diseases caused by Apicomplexa include:

* [[Babesiosis]] (''[[Babesia]]'')
* [[Cryptosporidiosis]] (''[[Cryptosporidium]]'')
* [[Malaria]] (''[[Plasmodium]]'')
* [[Toxoplasmosis]] (''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'')

Most members have a complex life-cycle, involving both asexual and sexual reproduction.  Typically, a host is infected by ingesting cysts, which divide to produce ''[[sporozoite]]s'' that enter its cells.  Eventually, the cells burst, releasing ''[[merozoites]]'' which infect new cells.  This may occur several times, until ''gamonts'' are produced, forming gametes that fuse to create new cysts.  There are many variations on this basic pattern, however, and many Apicomplexa have more than one host.

The apical complex includes vesicles called rhoptries and micronemes, which open at the anterior of the cell.  These secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells.  The tip is surrounded by a band of [[microtubule]]s, called the polar ring, and among the Conoidasida there is also a funnel of rods called the conoid.  Over the rest of the cell, except for a diminished mouth called the micropore, the membrane is supported by vesicles called alveoli, forming a semi-rigid pellicle.

The presence of alveoli and other traits place the Apicomplexa among a group called the [[alveolate]]s.  Several related flagellates, such as ''[[Perkinsus marinus|Perkinsus]]'' and ''Colpodella'' have structures similar to the polar ring and were formerly included here, but most appear to be closer relatives of the [[dinoflagellate]]s.  They are probably similar to the common ancestor of the two groups.

Another similarity is that apicomplexan cells contain a single [[plastid]], called the apicoplast, surrounded by either 3 or four membranes.  Its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid synthesis, it appears to be necessary for survival.  They are generally considered to share a common origin with the chloroplasts of dinoflagellates, although some studies suggest they are ultimately derived from [[green alga|green]] rather than [[red algae]].

The Apicomplexa comprise the bulk of what used to be called the Sporozoa, a group for parasitic protozoans without flagella, pseudopods, or cilia. Most of the Apicomplexa are motile however.  The other main lines were the [[Ascetosporea]], the [[Myxozoa]] (now known to be derived from [[animal]]s), and the [[Microsporidia]] (now known to be derived from [[fungus|fungi]]).  Sometimes the name Sporozoa is taken as a synonym for the Apicomplexa, or occasionally as a subset.

:''This article was a former [[Wikipedia:Spanish Translation of the Week|Spanish Translation of the Week]]. Portions of the [[#Central region and las Pampas]] and [[#Northwest region]] sections still need to be translated.  The Spanish text has been commented out; to translate, simply click &quot;edit&quot; on the specific sections.  You can also help by copyediting and proofreading.''

Argentine cuisine has evolved distinctly from the rest of the Latin American culinary landscape because of the heavy influence of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] and [[Spanish cuisine]]. These European traditions have been complemented by indigenous influences, most notably those of [[Andean]] origin (including [[Quechua]] and [[Mapuche]]) and those of Amazonic origin (such as the [[Guaraní]]).  The influx of Italian, Spanish and even some Near Eastern dishes makes the typical Argentine diet is a variation on what is often called the [[Mediterranean diet]].

Another determining factor in Argentine cuisine is that Argentina is one of the world's major food producers. It is a major producer of [[wheat]], beans, [[maize]] and corn, [[meat]] (especially [[beef]]), [[milk]] and, since the [[1970s]], [[soybean]]s. Given the country's vast production of beef, red meat is an exceedingly common part of the Argentine diet (in many periods of Argentine history the annual consumption of beef has been above 100 kg per capita  and during the 19th century, neared 180 kg per capita.) Similarly, the enormous quantities of domestically-harvested wheat have made white bread (made with wheat flour) the most commonly found on the table. This explains, to a great deal, the populariity of wheat-based Italian dishes, as well as the fact that Argentine pizza uses more dough than Italian pizza.

Besides the regional disparities addressed in this article, there exist at least two other comparisons which are important in understanding Argentine cuisine: the first distinguishes a cuisine that is essentially urban and cosmopolitan (highly influenced by the &quot;globalization&quot; of food and eating patterns) from a more traditional, idiosyncratic rural cuisine. The second comparison is made on the basis of socioeconomic differences.

While certain foods can be found in all corners of the country (barbecued meat; dulce de leche; empanadas; yerba mate,) one can map out four broad gastronomical regions based on major trends.


==Typical foods==
Argentines are famous for their high [[protein]] diet, particularly [[beef]]. Grilled meat (''parrilla'') from the ''[[asado]]'' is a staple, with [[steak]] and beef ribs especially common. ''[[Chorizo]]'', ''[[black pudding|morcilla]]'', ''[[chinchulines]]'', ''[[mollejas]]'', and other parts of the animal are enjoyed. In [[Patagonia]], lamb and [[chivito]] &amp;mdash; goat &amp;mdash; are eaten more than beef. Whole lambs and goats can be seen on the asado. ''[[Chimichurri]]'', a sauce of herbs and chili, is usually the only seasoning for steak and chorizo. 

[[Image:Spaghetti-prepared.jpg|right|200px|thumb|''Fideos'' and other Italian dishes are features of Argentine cuisine]]

Breaded and fried meat &amp;mdash; ''[[milanesa]]s'' &amp;mdash; are used as snacks, in sandwiches or eaten warm with mashed [[potato]]es &amp;mdash; ''puré''. ''[[Empanadas]]'' &amp;mdash; pastries of meat, cheese, sweet corn and a hundred other varieties &amp;mdash; are a common sight for parties, starters and [[picnic]]s across Argentina. Vegetables and salads are important too for Argentines, even beyond the fried or mashed potato. [[Tomato]]es, [[onions]], [[lettuce]], [[eggplant]]s, [[squash]]es and [[zucchini]] are common sides. 

Just as much as beef, [[Italy|Italian]] staples, such as [[pizza]] and ''[[al dente]]'' [[pasta]], are eaten. It is said that [[Buenos Aires]] has more pizzerias than [[Rome]]. ''[[noodles|Fideos]]'', ''[[Gnocchi|ñoquis]]'', ''[[Ravioli|ravioles]]'' and [[Cannelloni|canelones]] can be bought freshly-made on every block in [[Buenos Aires]]. Italian-style [[ice cream]] is made in huge parlours, with even drive-thru places offering hundreds of flavors to satisfy this national obsession.

In [[Chubut]], the Welsh community is known for their teahouses, with [[scones]] and ''Torta Galesa'', rather like [[Bara Brith]].

''Sandwiches de miga'' are delicate sandwiches made with crustless buttered white bread, very thinly sliced cured meat and cheese and leaf lettuce.  They are often purchased from entrepreneurial home cooks and consumed with a [[Cerveza Quilmes|Quilmes beer]] for a light evening meal.

[[Image:GEM corn.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Maize features in pre-Columbian Argentine cuisine]]

In the provinces, food is less European and more influenced by pre-Columbian and colonial traditions, with [[maize]], beans, [[pumpkin]]s and chilis making more appearances, whereas in Buenos Aires, even [[black pepper]] has been shunned. ''[[Locro]]'' is a spicy [[stew]] of white maize, often with pumpkin and [[sausage]]. ''Pucheros'' (stews) and ''cazuelas'' (casserikes) reflect a blend of [[Amerindian]] and Spanish cuisines.

The sweet paste, ''[[Dulce de leche]]'' is another national obsession, used to fill cakes and pancakes, spread over toasted bread for breakfast or as an ice cream flavour. ''[[Alfajor]]es'' are shortbread cookies sandwiched together with dulce de leche or a fruit paste.  The &quot;policeman's&quot; or &quot;truck driver's&quot; sweet is cheese with [[quince]] paste or ''dulce de membrillo''. ''Dulce de batata'' is made of [[sweet potato]] / [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]: this with cheese is the ''[[Martin Fierro]]'''s sweet. Fruits of Argentina are delicious, and their quinces, [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[peach]]es, [[kiwifruit]]s, [[avocado]]s and [[plum]]s are major exports.

A traditional drink of Argentina is a tea-like drink called ''[[yerba mate]]'' or ''mate''.  The dried leaves and twigs are placed in a small cup, also called ''mate'', usually made from a gourd, but also bone or horn. The drink is sipped through a metal or cane straw called a ''bombilla''. ''Mate'' can be sweetened with sugar, or flavoured with aromatic herbs or dried orange peel, to hide its strong bitter flavour, although this a less traditional method, looked at unkindly by seasoned drinkers, as the added flavours may remain in the gourd and influence later ''mates''. Hot water is poured into the gourd at near-boiling point so as to not burn the herb and spoil the flavour. This action is called ''cebando el mate'', and is considered an important social ritual. At family or small social gatherings, one mate may be shared by the group, with the host preparing the mate to the preference of each guest.  When one guest is finished, the mate is returned to the host, who will then prepare a mate for another guest.  ''Mate cocido'' is the same leaf, which rather than brewed, is boiled and served, as coffee or tea, with milk or sugar to taste. Other typical drinks include [[wine]] (occasionally mixed with soda water); tea and coffee are equally important. 'Quilmes' is the national brand of [[lager]], named after the town [[Quilmes]] where it was first produced.

==Regional differences==
Although there exists an Argentine cuisine that is common to the whole country&amp;mdash;[[asado]]s (grilled meats), [[dulce de leche]] (a sweet caramel-like custard), [[empanadas]] and [[mate]]&amp;mdash;there is a cuisine that is specific to each of four regions of Argentina, which follow in order of population (2005):

# Central/[[Pampa|Pampean]]
# North-west/[[Cuyo, Argentina|Cuyo]]
# North-east
# [[Patagonia]]/[[Tierra del Fuego]]

===Central region and las Pampas===
This region comprises of the provinces of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], part of [[Entre Ríos]], and all of the Autonomos City of [[Buenos Aires]].
This region of Argentina has received the greatest direct European influence, most visibly from [[Italy]] and [[Spain]]. It is also a crucial center of [[cattle]] production for Argentina and is thus the origin of the quintessentially Argentine dishes ''[[carne asada]]'' (roasted beef) and ''[[dulce de leche]]''.  It is here that red-meat-based foods are combined with white meat, dairy products and pasta, producing a high-[[protein]] [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].  

In addition to the aforementioned ''carne asada'' and ''dulce de leche'', other dishes that typify the region are ''milanesas'', or breaded meats. A common dish of this variety is the ''milanesa napolitana'' (the name comes from [[Naples]], [[Italy]]).  ''Milanesa napolitana'' is an Argentine innovation despite its name. In addition to roast beef, ''bifes'', and ''churrascos'', a visitor to the central region will find many dishes of Italian origin that have been incorporated into the Argentine cuisine and heavily modified from their original forms.

[[Pizza]] (locally pronounced ''pisa''), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian [[calzone]]s than it does its Italian ancestor. Typical or exclusively Argentine pizzas include ''pizza canchera'', ''pizza rellena'' (stuffed pizza), ''pizza por metro'' (pizza by the meter), and ''pizza a la parrilla'' (grilled pizza). While Argentine pizza, derives from [[Naples|Neapolitan]] cuisine, the Argentine ''fugaza''/''fugazza'' comes from the ''focaccia xeneise'' ([[Genoa]]n), but in any case its preparation is different from its Italian counterpart, and the addition of cheese to make the dish (fugaza con queso or fugazzeta) is an Argentine invention.

Another Argentine invention is ''[[fainá]]'', a type of fugazza made with [[chickpea]]  flour (adopted from Spain).  During the [[20th century]], people in pizza shops in Buenos Aires, Rosario or Córdoba have commonly ordered a &quot;combo&quot; of ''moscato'', pizza, and ''fainá''. This is a large glass of a sweet wine called [[moscato]] ([[muscat]]), plus two triangular stacked pieces (the lower one being pizza and the upper one ''fainá'').

Nevertheless, the ''[[pasta]]s'' (pasta, always in the plural) surpass pizzas in consumption levels. Among them are ''tallarines'' ([[fettuccine]]), ''ravioles'' ([[ravioli]]), ''ñoquis'' ([[gnocchi]], and ''canelones'' ([[cannelloni]]).  They are usually cooked, served, and consumed in Argentine fashion, called ''al-uso-nostro'', a phrase of Italian origin. 

For example, it is common for pasta to be eaten together with white bread (&quot;French bread&quot;), which is unusual in Italy. This can be explained by the low cost of bread and the fact that Argentine pastas tend to come together with a large amount of ''tuco'' sauce (Italian ''suco'' &quot;juice&quot;), and accompanied by ''[[estofado]]'' (stew). Less commonly, pastas are eaten with a dressing of ''[[pesto]]'', a green sauce based on [[basil]], or ''salsa blanca'' ([[Béchamel sauce]]).

The ''sorrentinos'' are also a local dish with a misleading name (they do not come from [[Sorrento]], but were invented in [[Mar del Plata]]). They look like big round ''ravioles'' stuffed with [[mozzarella]], [[cottage cheese]] and [[basil]] in [[tomato sauce]]. 

''[[Polenta]]'' comes from northern Italy and is very common throughout Argentina. But unlike in Italy, this [[cornmeal]] is eaten as a main dish, with sauce and melted cheese.

Spanish influences are abundant: desserts like the ''[[churros]]'' (cylinders of pastry, usually fried, sometimes filled with [[dulce de leche]]), [[''flan'']], 
''ensaimadas'' ([[Catalan]] sweet bread), and ''[[alfajor]]es'' are all descended from Spain. Main dishes such as the ''[[Spanish tortilla|tortillas]]'' ([[omelet]]s of egg, onion and potato, and having no relation to the Mexican dish of the same name), nearly all kinds of stew, ''arroces'' (rice dishes such as [[paella]]), and ''fabada'' ([[Asturian]] bean stew).  All of the ''[[guiso]]s'' and ''[[puchero]]s'' ([[stew]]s) are of Spanish origin. Argentine preparations of fish, such as dried salt [[cod]] (''[[Bacalhau|bacalao]]''), calamari, and octopus, originate from the [[Basque]] and [[Galician]] regions.  

''[[Empanada]]s'', though typically South American, have a [[Moorish]] origin (they derived from the [[Southwest Asia|Near-Eastern]] ''lahmayim'' and ''[[fatay]]''), and they can be also traced to the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n empanada and to certain stuffed ''[[calzoni]]''.

Germanic influence is comparatively small, but appears remarkable in the field of sweet dishes. The pastries known as ''facturas'' are Germanic in origin: [[croissant]]s, known as ''medialunas'', are the most popular of these, and can be found in two varieties: butter- and lard-based.  Also German in origin are the &quot;Berlinese&quot; known as ''bolas de fraile'' (&quot;friar's balls&quot;), and the rolls called ''piononos''. The ''facturas'' were re-christened with local names given the difficult phonology of German, and usually Argentinized by the addition of a dulce of leche filling.

Most dishes of the Central/Pampean region are urban, often requiring a gas [[oven]] of a type not found in the countryside. This is not strange considering that more than 80% of the [[demographics of Argentina|Argentine population]] is concentrated in the main cities of this region ([[Buenos Aires City|Buenos Aires]], [[Rosario]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], etc.). Not much is left of the ''gaucho'' food, except ''asado'', ''dulce de leche'', ''mate'' (the yerba mate infusion), ''tortas fritas'', and ''arroz con leche'' ([[rice pudding]]).

The scene was different until the first half of the 19th century.  [[Lucio V. Mansilla]] in his ''Memorias'' records that in the cities of Buenos Aires province (which at that time also included [[Montevideo]], now in [[Uruguay]]) common foods were ''[[quibebe]]'', ''[[mazamorra]]'' (a sweet, milky corn pudding) as a dessert, ''[[chancaca]]'' (a sugary, brown, corn cake), the [[pacú]] fish, ''[[surubí]], [[sábalo]], ''asados'' (roasts) etc.'' 

When the [[Salta]]-born [[Juana Manuela Gorriti]] wrote her book ''La cocina ecléctica'' (&quot;Eclectic Cuisine&quot;) in the last years of the 19th century, already a large part of the Argentine preparations mentioned in this book were forgotten among the people of the Central region and the Pampas. It was precisely in this era that the great innovative influx of Italian immigrants and Italian food occurred. The aforementioned L.V. Mansilla noted the existence of ''ravioles'' in principal cities of the [[Río de la Plata]] basin around the [[1880s]]; [[Jorge Luis Borges]] said that &quot;the first time&quot; that he came to know ravioli was at the beginning of the 20th century, while very young, at the home of Italian immigrants whose Argentine son invited him.

In the rural areas of the Pampas corresponding to la [[Pampa Húmeda]], principally in the center and south of Santa Fe, center, east and south of Córdoba and north Buenos Aires, sausage preparations such as ''salames'' ([[salami]]), ''[[bondiola]]s'', ''[[codeguín|codeguines]]'', ''[[salamín|salamines]]'', etc. are very common. 

The preparation of [[ham]] is inherited as much from the Spanish ''[[jabugo]]s'' as from the ''[[prosciutto|prosciutti]]'' of Parma (Italy). The most famous Argentine hams are probably the '''jamones serranos''' (Serrano hams) from [[Sierras de Córdoba]] and environs.

&lt;!--
Despite the fact that many Italian and Spanish immigrants came from coastal areas and despite the fact that Argentina is rich in marine resources, during the entire 20th century, the level of fish consumption has been relatively low. The main explanation of this phenomenon was the abundant availability of beef and poultry (mainly chicken) and to the fact that these types of meet are more filling than most fish, and shellfish; the most common preparations of fish have been simple [[escalope]]s of fillet of ''[[merluza]]  y [[chapín]]es. Aunque desde la segunda mitad de s XX el porcentaje de católicos practicantes ha disminuido de continuo y en el 2005 quizás sólo sean un 20% de la población total, se mantienen en gran medida las festividades y los platos asociados a ellas'': [[Christmas]] &amp;ndash; on Christmas it is traditional to eat oven-roasted ''[[pavo]] o chancho (puerco) al horno,'' accompanied by [[turron]]s, and ''[[pan dulce]]'' that is directly derived from [[Milan]]ese [[panettone]]. For [[Easter]] they eat [[Easter egg]]s. ''En tanto que para [[Semana Santa]]  fechas en que la iglesia exige ayuno de carnes salvo las de pescados, son típicas las '''empanadas de vigilia''' (principalmente las rellenas de atún), y guisados con'' ''bacalao'' ([[cod]])  or, in its absence, ''[[cazón]]''.

Wine production in this part of Argentina is qualitatively and quantitatively inferior than that in the Northeast and the Cuyo; nonetheless, there are some interesting wines: in the colonial era, famous wines were made by the Jesuits en [[Alta Gracia]] (in the [[Sierras de Córdoba]]), and since  the end of the 19th century notable wines have come from [[Caroya]], also in the province of Córdoba though not in the ''sierra'' but the piedemontof the Cordobam ''pampa''. ''También se ha producido y producen vinos de humilde calidad en la región llamada &quot;La Costa&quot;'', which is to say ''las zonas ribereñas del río Paraná y del Río de La Plata desde la ciudad de Santa Fe hasta las adyacencias de La Plata; del otro lado del Río de La Plata ,en Uruguay , se ha logrado la producción de un vino de más calidad ,principalmente en [[Juanicó]].

La producción láctea de la región pampeana es ingente (pese a que se vio perjudicada durante la década de los 90 de s XX y el primer lustro de s XXI por la llamada &quot;soyización&quot; o &quot;sojización&quot; del campo argentino). Aunque la gran producción láctea de la región aún no se ve reflejada en la producción a una escala importante de quesos típicos, sin embargo puede hacerse mención del [[queso Mar del Plata]]  y del [[queso Colonia]] (el queso Colonia es de procedencia uruguaya, fabricado inicialmente en [[Colonia Suiza]], aunque su elaboración se ha difundido en zonas de Buenos Aires y Santa Fe). También originado fuera de esta zona, tal como su nombre lo señala, es el [[queso Chubut]] sin embargo durante el s XX el sur de la provincia de Buenos Aires ha sido importante productor de este tipo de queso. Las pizzas argentinas suelen ser preparadas con ''[[musarela]]'' ,queso que imita al italiano llamado [[mozzarella]], aunque por lo general la musarela es realizada con leche de oveja o leche de vaca, a diferencia de la leche de búfala que es la usada para la mozzarella, los fideos y otras pastas (inclusive la polenta) suelen ser cubiertas con [[queso rallado]]]  de tipo [[parmigiano]] or [[regiano]]. Otro queso of Italian origin bastante apreciado en Argentina (y muchas veces cocinado junto a los asados) es el [[provolone]].

En líneas generales, durante el s XX el gusto más común entre los argentinos se ha dirigido a los quesos de tipo francés, y es debido a esto que en Argentina se logran buenas o aceptables imitations of French cheeses.

===Northwest region===

The Northwest region includes the provinces of [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]], [[Salta Province|Salta]], [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]], [[Santiago del Estero Province|Santiago del Estero]], [[La Rioja Province, Argentina|La Rioja]], [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]], [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], and [[San Luis Province|San Luis]].

The cuisine of this region shows the massive influence of the pre[[hispanic]] cultures in the [[Andes Mountains]]; in fact the historical centers of the provinces of this region are located in Andean areas, with the exception of Tucumán, Santiago del Estero y San Luis, although Tucumán and San Luis retain physical characteristics similar to the Andeans and their traditional products are in an Andean style (such as corn and potatoes) and include the existence of the &quot;taco&quot; or the native carob bean.

There also exist here, as in almost all of continental Argentina, an important cattle ranching industry, but there are also other herds of animals: aside from the indigenous species(especially the llama), in addition there are non-native species acclimated for almost half a millennium, such as goats, sheep and pigs. The native species in this region have been relegated almost exclusively to the arid zones of the Puna and the High Andean Desert.

In agriculture, in addition to potatoes and corn, one finds many varieties of indigenous vegetables: [[quinoa]] and [[kiwicha]] prosper in the least humid zones, while in more humid areas, beans, tomatoes, [[pumpkin]]s, [[chile pepper]]s, [[avocado]]s, and ''el cayote'' abound.

&lt;!--
Non-native plant species are also cultivated in Northeast Argentina and Cuyo: excellent ''vides, olives, nuez/nueces, duraznos, peras, cebollas, ajos, damascos, ciruelas. 
En las zonas más húmedas es grande la producción de: caña de azúcar, limón, plátanos (bananas), oranges;'' apples do well in the coldest zones  ''correspondientes al Cuyo.''
Frome this we can infer that, traditionally, this region ''ha sido la dotada de una mayor base para una mayor variedad de platos. Si en toda la Argentina son típicas las empanadas, es en esta región en donde llega a su apogeo la preparación de las mismas, y las diversas provincias de este conjunto rivalizan en cúal de ellas tiene las mejores empanadas,en esto suelen destacarse las tucumanas y salteñas rellenas de carne ó de [[humita]].''
Another typical dish of the region (and available throughout the country) ''es la especie de suculento guiso preparado principalmente con granos de maíz: el locro. En lo real existen diversas variedades de locro (por ejemplo el [[huascha locro]]  o locro pobre), siendo el [[mote]] una especie de locro.
--&gt;
On the other hand, in this area the preparation of [[tamale]]s and [[humita]]s in corn husks is common.

Other culinary specialties of this region are almond paste ([[marzipan]]), dried peaches, [[maize]] cake, pork stew with corn, steak, cheap stew, meat stew and  eggs ''quimbos''; as well as potato cake, although this last one is often made in other areas of Argentina in recent times.

Tucumán stands out for the excellent cheeses of Tafí.

While nearly all the provinces in the region (except for Tucumán and Santiago del Ester) produce wines that in most cases have won worldwide acclaim, among the wines one must mention at least one that is exclusively Argentine: ''torrontés'', a fragrant white wine with a fruity flavor, produced in the Calchaquíes Valleys. Among vintners producing ''torrontés'', the most famous is Cafayate. In the north, as well as in Tarija, liquors (''aguardientes'') are made from grapes or distilled from wine, such as [[singani]], or others similar to Chilean [[pisco]].

However, the great majority of Argentines prefer French-style wines (including sparkling wines like [[champagne (beverage)|champagne]]). This taste is found in the higher economic strata, where the purchasing power is greatest, and as a consequence, native, Italian, and Spanish wines all play second fiddle to French wines to Argentine palates (at least in the 20th century).
&lt;!--
De los vinos de tipo italiano que se producen en Argentina se destacan los que imitan al ''Chianti'', de los de tipo español los más conocidos son los llamados carlón.
En ciertas zonas y en ciertos grupos socioeconómicos argentinos existe una preferencia por los vinos endulzados artificialmente (avocados) gusto quizás derivado de los &quot;vinos de misa&quot; (principalmente el llamado &quot;mistela&quot;), esto se entiende más si se recuerda que las primeras cepas de vid para vino fueron plantadas en Argentina a inicios de s XVI precísamente para cumplir con la liturgia católica.

Se ha hecho mención ya del algarrobo, con la vaina de este árbol se realizan alimentos y bebidas artesanales: una especie de pan llamado patay y una especie de cerveza llamada aloja.

Northwest Argentina es territorio en que se produces a great variety of dulces, algunos de ellos de consumo masivo en todo el país: dulce de batata y dulce de membrillo -con estos y ''queso fresco'' se realizan los postres llamados fresco y batata  y [[postre vigilante]]  muy comunes en casi cualquier parte de Argentina-, más restringidos al Noroeste son los arropes de chañar y de tuna, o los dulces de melaza y cayote. 
Un postre simple típico del Noroeste Agentino es el quesillo de cabra con miel de abeja.
--&gt;

===Northeast region===

The region includes the provinces of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], [[Chaco Province|Chaco]], [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], [[Formosa Province|Formosa]], and most of [[Entre Ríos]], the north of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], and the east of [[Santiago del Estero Province|Santiago del Estero]].

Four principal foods characterize the nourishing productions of this Argentine region: ''la mandioca'', rice, freshwater fish, and mate.

This area of Argentina provides ''yerba mate'' (''caá'') to the rest of the nation, and even to neighboring states. The two provinces of Corrientes and Misiones are the principal producers of ''yerba''. As the main producer of yerba mate, the mate drink is most popular in this area. In the Northeast, mate is sometimes mixed with cold fruit juices (called ''Tereré''), or even with spirits.

''Mandioca'' [[cassava]] and many dishes of Northeast Argentina are identical or very similar to those of [[Paraguay]] and of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]]. Common foods include varieties of homemade breads (''panes caseros''), some made with ''mandioca'' flour, and [[tapioca]]. Varieties of tapioca called ''chipá'' and ''chipaca'' spread throughout [[Southern cone]] due to internal migrations. ''Mandioca'' is also the base for the dish called ''beyú'' (also known as ''mbeyú'' or ''mvejú''). Empanadas are also made here with ''Mandioca'' flour instead of traditional wheat flour. Rice is widely available and is often used in the filling of empanadas. In the Entre Rios province it is also possible to find empanadas filled with [[milk pudding]].

The abundance of rivers, streams, and lagoons makes fish common to the northeastern diet. Among the fish commonly eaten are ''pacú'', ''dorado'', [[surubí]], ''mandiyú'', ''manguruyú'', ''patí'' and [[Leporinus obtusidens|boga]]. They can be roasted, served with rice stews or in empanadas.

''Carpincho'' ([[capybara]]) and ''[[yacaré]]'' meat were common before the arrival of the Spanish conquest, and can still be found. The ''carpincho'' is sometimes cooked by placing hot stones inside the dead animal.

Fruit production is also widespread, and fruit is a component of various desserts and beverages. The horticultural fruits are [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[banana]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[avocado]]s, [[grapefruit]]s, [[tangerine]]s, and [[pineapple]]s. 

[[Palm tree]]s are found in this region, and the ''palmitos'' ([[palm heart]]s) are nowadays eaten all over Argentina, usually with ''Salsa Golf'', a mix of [[ketchup]] and [[mayonnaise]].

===Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego===

This region consists of the provinces of [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], [[Neuquén Province|Neuquén]], [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]], [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz]], and [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina|Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica and South Atlantic Islands]]. 

Here, one can encounter ''asados'' (roasts), ''dulce de leche'' , ''empanadas'' (except for the [[Falkland Islands|Falkland Islands]]), and the intake of infusions of ''yerba mate'' (although it often has to come from abroad).

Tallarines, Raviolis, ''ñoquis'' ([[gnocchi]]), and pizzas are also common in Southern Argentina. Unlike the rest of the country, the southern region has, like its natural production, migratory influences, and its climate, has come unique characteristics. In addition to the always present influence of [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Castillian]] flavors, one can notice the influence of Central and Northwestern Europe.

Welsh immigration, for example, since the second half of the 1960s in Chubut has introduced two large contributions to local cuisine: the [[torta negra]], and the cheese called [[Chubut]], whose consumption later sspread to the greater part of Patagonia (especially in [[Neuquén]]) and in the south of the province of Buenos Aires.

Central European immigration has spread the preparation of certain deserts and sweets (cherry, apple, raspberry, [[bilberry]], ''rosa mosqueta'', ''zarzaparrilla'' ([[sarsaparilla]]), sauces, etc.) chocolates like those of [[Bariloche]] and the practice of smoking wild boar and red deer meat.

The original peoples had made their particular contributions, such as the [[curanto]], el ñaco (a kind of porridge), breads and cakes made from flour composed of ''&quot;nuez&quot; de [[pehuén]]'', a candy called ''[[llao llao]]'', as well as the fruits of the [[lenga]] and [[calafate]].

The coastlines and lakes of this region have proven rich in [[fish]] and [[shellfish]], leading to extravagant preparation of [[seafood]]. It is common to find ''&quot;patés&quot;'', roasts and ''guisos'' of ''centolla'' ([[spider crab]]), [[squid]], ''[[giant squid]]'', [[octopus]], [[pollock]], [[salmon]], [[trout]]s, ''[[corvina]]s'', [[oyster]]s, and so forth.

The cold weather is a good &quot;excuse&quot; for the consumption of spirits, the Andean portion of Patagonia produces their crafted beers, and the current trends compare those found in Ireland and Central Europe. In the valleys of the Río Negro y Neuquén (ultimately going into northwest Chubut) fine white wines such as Riesling are made, being perhaps the most southern vineyards in the world.

Inevitably, there are also roasts. Characteristically, in the southern part of Argentina, besides cattle roast, there are pig roasts, goat roasts, and especially ''[[cordero|corderito patagónico]]'' lamb, [[guanaco]], ''ñandú'' ([[rhea (bird)|rhea]]), and Patagonic deer.

==Other foods and beverages==
Though we have assembled a review of the cuisine of Argentina and its principal regions, with abundant information, it would be incomplete if the article mentioned only the foods and beverages already cited.

For example, though the importance of the production and consumption of wine (''vino'') has been discussed, it is important to note that [[beer]] (''cerveza''; the Italian ''birra'' is frequently used) in the second half of the 20th century (at the least) and in the first five years of the 21st, competes with wine in popularity. Breweries appeared in Argentina at the end of the 1860s, started by Alsacian colonists; the first were almost in the downtown of Buenos Aires (''el égido de la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires''), and soon Polish brewers began industrial production of beer: San Carlos in the province of Santa Fe, Río Segundo and Córdoba in the province of Córdoba, [[Quilmes]] and Lavallol on the outskirts of La Plata (a province of Buenos Aires), [[San Miguel de Tucumán]] in the province of Tucumán and on the outskirts of the cities of [[Mendoza]] and [[Salta]]. The presence of a rather important production and consumption of beer has supported the existence of related events, for example the so-called ''[[Oktoberfest]]s'' (sic) or &quot;''Fiestas de la Cerveza''&quot; in locations that have a significant German population ([[Villa General Belgrano]] in Córdoba, [[San Carlos, Santa Fe|San Carlos]] and [[Esperanza, Santa Fe|Esperanza]] in the province of Santa Fe, etc.). Such celebrations copy, in an Argentine manner, [[Munich]]'s ''Oktoberfest'', and similarly are tourist attractions. However, the presence of an also-numerous population of [[Celt]]ic lineage, principally of [[Ireland|Irish]] origin, has supported the creation of other celebrations of beer, often for marketing purposes, such as [[Saint Patrick's Day]] (''Día de San Patricio''), patron of Ireland, which is celebrated with abundant libations. 

Although the consumption of alcoholic beverages in Argentina is perhaps less than that of the United States, and certainly much less than that of the British Isles, Scandinavia, or Central and Eastern Europe, the Argentines enjoy a variety of alcoholic beverages and Argentina can boast a varied array of ''elaboraciones'', whether industrial or artisanal. Besides beer and wine, Argentines frequently drink [[cider]] (here again, the heritage comes from Spain and Italy, more precisely from [[Asturias]] and [[Campania]]). Cider is the most popular beverage of the middle and lower economic classes at [[Christmas]] and [[New Year]] (the high classes preferring to celebrate with [[champagne (beverage)|champagne]]).

Other widely consumed spirits are ''aguardiente'' ([[firewater]]) made from sugar cane, known as ''[[caña quemada]]'' (&quot;burnt cane&quot;) or, simply, ''caña'' (&quot;cane&quot;). A folkloric note about ''caña quemada'': until [[June 21]] it is traditional to drink ''caña quemada'' with ''ruda macho'' (a variant of [[common rue]]), it is supposed that this mixture prevents the [[flu]] and other illnesses. ''Caña'' competes, mainly in rural areas, with [[gin]].

There are many artisanally produced [[liqueur]]s (distilled, flavored alcoholic beverages) in Argentina, for example those flavored with ''[[peperina]]'', [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[egg (food)|egg]], [[anise]], [[coffee]], [[cherry]] and, inevitably, ''dulce de leche''. The ''[[esperidina]]'' is a type of liqueur  made from orange peels, invented in Argentina around 1890. One may also encounter ''chitronchelo'' or (in Italian) ''[[citroncello]]'', based on lemon. This beverage arrived with immigrants from the [[Mezzogiorno]], and is produced both artisanally and industrially (for example, in Mar del Plata).

Nevertheless, Argentines are far more adept at non-alcoholic infusions (although now and then both &quot;families&quot; are mixed; the ''[[yerbiao]]'' for example, is mate mixed with ''caña'' or gin). To say that the ''[[Yerba mate|mate]]'' is the favourite drink might be redundant but it must be done; but the fact that the ''mate'' is very consumed by the inhabitants of the ''[[Southern Cone]]'' must not lure the foreigner into thinking that other infusions are rare in the region, in Argentina especially, given that there is a strong European cultural imprint, the consumption of [[coffee]] is very common. And not so long ago [[chocolate]] infusions were common (the eating of chocolate is a Spanish influence&amp;mdash;although the plant originated in Meso-America), this consumption grows during autumn and winter, or in the cold regions of the country; there are two dates where consumption of chocolate infusions is traditional in the primary educational centres: [[25 May]] and [[9 July]], that is, the two national dates of Argentina.

The English cultural influx (reinforced at the end of the 19th century and beginnings of the 20th by the resurgence of the Far East) has also made very common the consumption of [[tea]].

To finish the index of infusions consumed in Argentina, it must be said that [[medicinal herbs]] are common in the whole country, and that many of them are drunk infused: [[chamomile]], [[lanceleaf]], ''[[boldo]]'', ''[[poleo]]'', ''[[peperina]]'', ''[[carqueja]]'', ''[[tomillo]]'', ''[[canchalagua]]'', rue (''macho'' and ''hembra'', that is, &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;), ''malva'', ''romero'', [[passion flower]], ''[[bira bira]]'', ''[[palán palán]]'', ''[[muña muña]]'', to mention only the main ones. Many of these herbs are also used in [[apéritif]]s and [[bitters]], whether alcoholic or not.

Common ''restoranes'' or ''restaurantes'' nearly anywhere in Argentina today serve (into the wee hours) quickly prepared meals that in the course of the 20th century came to be known as ''minutas''. Some of the dishes included in the catgory of ''minutas'' are ''[[milanesa]]s'', ''churrascos'', ''bifes'', ''escalopes'', ''tallarines'', ''ravioles'', ''ñoquis'', although some are very typical of locations that sell food: &quot;''bifes a caballo''&quot; (beef steak with two fried eggs), &quot;''milanesa a horse''&quot;, &quot;''milanesa completa''&quot; (a ''milanesa'' with two fried eggs and a garnish of [[french fries|fries]]), &quot;''[[revuelto Gramajo]]''&quot;, &quot;''[[colchón de arvejas]]''&quot;, &quot;''suprema de chicken''&quot; (a kind of chicken ''milanesa''), ''[[matambre]]s'', &quot;''[[lengua a la vinagreta]]''&quot; and &quot;[[sandwich]]es&quot;.

The variety of &quot;sandwiches&quot; (called thus in Argentina, as opposed to the Spanish ''emparedado'') are nearly infinite. The most common are those made of ''milanesa'', baked ham and cheese, ''pan de miga'', toasted bread, ''[[pebete]]s'', ''[[pancho]]s'',  ''[[choripan]]es'', ''[[morcipan]]es'', etc.; from [[Montevideo]] comes a different species of sandwich called the ''[[chivito (sandwich)|chivito]]'', even though it contains no [[chivito|goat meat]].

It is worth mentioning ''[[picada]]s'', which are consumed in homes or bars, cafés, &quot;''cafetines''&quot; and &quot;''bodegones''&quot;; they consist of an ensemble of plates containing cubes of cheese (typically from Mar del Plata or Chubut), pieces of [[salame]], [[olive]]s in brine, french fries, ''maníes'' ([[peanut]]s), etc.; ''picada''s are eaten accompanied by an alcoholic beverage (&quot;''fernet''&quot;, beer, wine with [[soda]], to give some common examples).

To conclude, it should be noted that the people of Argentina greatly enjoy ''helado'' ([[ice cream]], [[sorbet]], etc.), especially the Italian kind. This fondness is not new: from the time of the Spanish colonies there has existed a type of sorbet made from fallen hail or snow. (This has been documented; desserts were made with snow in Mendoza at the beginning of the 19th century.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''ad hominem''' argument, also known as '''argumentum ad hominem''' ([[Latin]], literally &quot;argument to the man&quot;) or '''attacking the messenger''', is a [[logical fallacy]] that involves replying to an argument or assertion by attacking the person presenting the argument or assertion rather than the argument itself.

The derived [[neologism]] ''ad feminam'' is more specifically used to refer to sexist prejudice directed towards women. (For example, &quot;Their recourse ... to ad feminam attacks evidences the chilly climate for women's leadership on campus.&quot;) ''Ad hominem'' does not pertain to the male sex, as ''[[Homo (genus)|homo]]'' in Latin refers to all humans; thus certain usage of &quot;ad feminam&quot; may be considered redundant, or even erroneous: 
*&quot;... in which both or multiple parties ... avoid ad hominem and ad feminam judgements ...&quot; (Barbara Levy Simon)
*&quot;Almost any ad hominem (or, in this case, ad feminam) response ...&quot; (Marsha M Linehan)

==''Ad hominem'' as logical fallacy==
A (fallacious) ad hominem argument has the basic form:

#''A'' makes claim ''B'';
#there is something objectionable about ''A'',
#therefore claim ''B'' is false.
The first statement is called a 'factual claim' and is the pivot point of much debate.
The last statement is referred to as an 'inferential claim' and represents the reasoning process. There are two types of inferential claim, explicit and implicit.
Arguments that (fallaciously) rely on the positive aspects of the person for the truth of the conclusion are discussed under ''[[appeal to authority]]''.

Ad hominem is one of the best-known of the logical fallacies usually enumerated in introductory [[logic]] and [[critical thinking]] textbooks. Both the fallacy itself, and accusations of having committed it, are often brandished in actual discourse (see also [[Argument from fallacy]]).  As a technique of [[rhetoric]], it is powerful and used often, despite its lack of subtlety.

==Usage==
An  ''ad hominem'' fallacy consists of asserting that someone's argument is wrong and/or they are wrong to argue at all ''purely'' because of something discreditable/not-authoritative about the person or those persons cited by them rather than addressing the soundness of the argument itself. The implication is that the person's argument and/or ability to argue correctly lacks authority. Merely insulting another person in the middle of otherwise rational discourse does not necessarily constitute an ad hominem fallacy. It must be clear that the purpose of the characterization is to discredit the person offering the argument, and, specifically, to invite others to discount his arguments. In the past, the term ''ad hominem'' was sometimes used more literally, to describe an argument that was based on an individual, or to describe any personal attack. But this is not how the meaning of the term is typically introduced in modern logic and rhetoric textbooks, and logicians and rhetoricians are widely agreed that this use is incorrect.  

'''Examples''':
:&quot;You claim that this man is innocent, but you cannot be trusted since you are a criminal as well.&quot;

:&quot;You feel that abortion should be legal, but I disagree because you are uneducated and poor.&quot;

Not all ''ad hominem'' attacks are insulting: 

'''Example''': 
:&quot;Paula says the umpire made the correct call, but this is false because Paula is too important to pay attention to the game.&quot;

This is an ''ad hominem'' fallacy, even though it is saying something positive about the person, because it is addressing the person and not the topic in dispute.

Ironically, accusing an opponent of ''ad hominem'' can itself be an example of ''ad hominem'' if it is worded as an insult: &quot;I'm not going to stand here and let him insult me!&quot; or &quot;My opponent is resorting to logical fallacy to win.&quot; or &quot;Since he is out of good argument, he's attacking me.&quot; (partial [[Argument from silence]])

==Validity==
''Ad hominem'' is fallacious when applied to deduction, and not the evidence (or premise) of an argument.  Evidence may be doubted or rejected based on the source for reasons of [[credibility]], but to doubt or reject a [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] based on the source is the ''ad hominem'' fallacy.

Premises discrediting the person can exist in [[validity|valid]] arguments, when the person being criticized is the sole source for a piece of evidence used in one of his arguments.

#''A'' committed perjury when he said ''Q''
#We should not accept testimony for which perjury was committed
#therefore, ''A'' 's testimony for ''Q'' should be rejected


==Subtypes==
Three traditionally identified varieties are '''ad hominem abusive''', '''ad hominem circumstantial''', and '''ad hominem tu quoque'''. 

===Ad hominem abusive===
Ad hominem abusive (also called ''argumentum ad personam'') usually and most notoriously involves insulting one's opponent, but can also involve pointing out factual but damning character flaws or actions. The reason that this is fallacious is that &amp;mdash; usually, anyway &amp;mdash; insults and even damaging facts simply do not undermine what logical support there might be for one's opponent's arguments or assertions; ''argumentum ad personam'' short-circuits these potential arguments from logic in favor of a direct attack on the opponent's authority.

'''Example:''' 
:&quot;You can't believe Jack when he says there is no [[god]] ''because'' he doesn't even have a job.&quot;

'''Example 2:'''
This can be called the internet example, or the childish example. Somebody disproves a [[internet troll|troll]], or a bully's argument, and they respond with: &quot;Yeah, but you're gay!.&quot; The logical fallacy is that because the person is accused of being homosexual, their argument is invalid.

===Ad hominem circumstantial===
Ad hominem circumstantial involves pointing out that someone is in circumstances such that he is disposed to take a particular position. Essentially, circumstantial ad hominem constitutes an attack on the bias of a person. The reason that this is fallacious is that it simply does not make one's opponent's arguments, from a logical point of view, any less credible to point out that one's opponent is disposed to argue that way. Such arguments are not necessarily ''[[Rationality|irrational]]'', but are not correct in strict logic. This illustrates one of the differences between rationality and logic.

'''Examples:'''
:&quot;Tobacco company representatives are wrong when they say smoking doesn't seriously affect your health, ''because'' they're just defending their own multi-million-dollar financial interests.&quot; 

:&quot;He's physically addicted to nicotine. Of course he defends smoking!”

The [[Mandy Rice-Davies]] ploy, &quot;Well, he would [say that], wouldn't he?&quot; is a superb use of this fallacy.

===Ad hominem tu quoque===
Ad hominem tu quoque (literally, &quot;at the person, you too&quot;) could be called the &quot;hypocrisy&quot; argument. It occurs when a person's claim is dismissed or concluded as false either because the claim is about actions the claimant or another individual has engaged in ''too'', or because the claim is inconsistent with other claims that the person has made. The tu quoque fallacy mimics the legitimate use of the principle of ethical symmetry. The error is that while expressing &quot;fair play&quot; sentiments, what the argument is actually advocating is &quot;equal rights for foul play.&quot; In &quot;fair play&quot;, if one reasoner is not entitled to use a particular appeal, then no other reasoner may use it either. It does not entitle reasoners to use illegitimate appeals because other reasoners have used, possibly without challenge, similar illegitimate appeals. That the illegitimate appeal has been used before does not make it legitimate. 

====You-too version====
This form of the argument is as follows:
:''A'' makes criticism ''P''.
:''A'' is also guilty of ''P''.
:Therefore, ''P'' is dismissed. 

This is an instance of the [[two wrongs make a right (fallacy)|two wrongs make a right]] fallacy.

Example:
:&quot;''You cannot accuse me of [[libel]] because you yourself have ''also'' been convicted of libel.''&quot;
:&quot;''You cannot complain about my [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] because you smoke ''too''.&quot;

:''[[United States]]: the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[human rights]] record is questionable.''&lt;br&gt;
:''Soviet Union: [[And you are lynching Negroes]].''

====Inconsistency version====
This form of the argument is as follows:
:A makes claim P.
:A has ''also'' made claims which are inconsistent with P.
:Therefore, P is false (or is dismissed).

If the conclusion is that &quot;P is false&quot;, then this is a ''logical fallacy'' because the conclusion that P is false does not follow from the premises; even if A has made past claims which are inconsistent with P, it does not necessarily prove that P is either true or false.

Example:
:''&quot;You say [[airplane]]s are able to fly because of the laws of [[physics]], but this is false because twenty years ago you also said airplanes fly because of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].&quot;''
:''&quot;US Democrats say that we shouldn't participate in war in Iraq, but they supported it after 9/11.&quot;''
:''&quot;US Republicans say that CIA intelligence is faulty, but they relied on it when we sent troops to Iraq.&quot;''

==Taxonomy==
This form of the ''argumentum ad hominem'' is a [[genetic fallacy]] and [[red herring (fallacy)|red herring]], and is often but not necessarily an [[appeal to emotion]]. Argumentum ad hominem includes [[poisoning the well]].

      <comment>Computational complexity theory</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">To '''analyze an [[algorithm]]''' is to determine the amount of resources (such as time and storage) necessary to execute it. Most algorithms are designed to work with inputs of arbitrary length. Usually the '''efficiency''' or '''[[Computational complexity theory|complexity]]''' of an algorithm is stated as a function relating the [[problem size|input length]] to the number of steps ('''time complexity''') or storage locations ('''space or memory complexity''') required to execute the algorithm. 

Algorithm analysis is an important part of a broader [[computational complexity theory]], which provides theoretical estimates for the resources needed by any algorithm which solves a given computational problem. These estimates provide an insight into reasonable directions of search of efficient algorithms.

In theoretical analysis of algorithms it is common to estimate their complexity in '''asymptotic sense''', i.e., to estimate the complexity function for reasonably large length of input. [[Big O notation]], [[Big O notation|omega]] notation and [[Big O notation|theta]] notation are used to this end. For instance, [[binary search]] is said to run an amount of steps proportional to a logarithm, or in O(log(n)), colloquially &quot;in logarithmic time&quot;. Usually asymptotic estimates are used because different [[implementation]]s of the same algorithm may differ in efficiency. However the efficiencies of any two &quot;reasonable&quot; implementations of a given algorithm are related by a constant multiplicative factor  called '''hidden constant'''.

Exact (not asymptotic) measures of efficiency can sometimes be computed but they usually require certain assumptions concerning the particular implementation of the algorithm, called [[model of computation]]. A model of computation may be defined in terms of an [[abstract machine|abstract computer]], e.g., [[Turing machine]], and/or by postulating that certain operations are executed in unit time.
For example, if the sorted set to which we apply [[binary search]] has n elements, and we can guarantee that a single binary lookup can be done in unit time, then at most log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; N + 1 time units are needed to return an answer.

Exact measures of efficiency are useful to the people who actually implement and use algorithms, because they are more precise and thus enable them to know how much time they can expect to spend in execution. To some people (e.g. game programmers), a hidden constant can make all the difference between success and failure.

Time efficiency estimates depend on what we define to be a step. For the analysis to make sense, the time required to perform a step must be guaranteed to be bounded above by a constant. One must be careful here; for instance, some analyses count an addition of two numbers as a step. This assumption may not be warranted in certain contexts. For example, if the numbers involved in a computation may be arbitrarily large, addition no longer can be assumed to require constant time (compare the time you need to add two 2-digit integers and two 1000-digit integers using a pen and paper).

'''Ælle ''' was  king of the [[Kingdom of Sussex|South Saxons]] from [[477]] to perhaps as late as [[514]], and was named [[Bretwalda]] by [[Bede]], who adds that he was overlord of the [[English people|English]] south of the [[Humber]] river.

Our source for the events of Ælle's life (besides the short mention in Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'') is the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]], compiled in 891.  It states that he landed in Britain in [[477]] with three ships and his three sons Cymen, Wlencing, and [[Cissa of Sussex|Cissa]] at Cymenes ora, where &quot;they killed many of the Welsh, and drove the rest into the wood that is called Anredsleage.&quot; For the year [[485]], the Chronicle records that he again fought the &quot;Welsh&quot; at the stream of Mearcread. Then in [[491]], Ælle with the help of Cissa successfully besieged [[Anderida]] (also identified as Pevensey), and slew all of the inhabitants. And with that last entry, the Chronicle contains no more records of this warchief; we have neither a record of the time that he died, nor the means, nor the events in the kingdom of the South Saxons that succeeded his death until the baptism of its king Æthelwalh around [[675]].

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle at this point begins narrating the events of the founding of the West Saxon kingdom, or [[Wessex]], so it is possible that the scribe assembling this chronicle forgot to return to the events of Ælle's life. Alaistar Campbell, in examining the chronology of this part of the Chronicle, notes that at several places events are duplicated at 28 year intervals, suggesting that the sources from which the composing scribe assembled the Chronicle were based on 28-year [[Easter]] Tables, and that the annal that mentioned the later events of Ælle's life were mislaid.

Ælle’s career may be largely fictional. He is said to have arrived in three ships, with three sons, and fought three battles. The three ships motif occurs in other myths: &quot;According to their own legend, reported by the mid-6th-century Gothic historian Jordanes, the Goths originated in southern Scandinavia and crossed in three ships under their king Berig to the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, where they settled…&quot; [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037486].

The story of Ælle is a heroic Old English legend which explains the acquisition of Sussex. An entirely different and equally implausible British (Welsh) story was preserved by Nennius. He stated that Hengist treacherously seized the British king Vortigern and demanded the cession of Essex and Sussex as ransom for the king: ''Hengistus sicut dixerat, vociferatus est et omnes seniores trecenti Guorthigirni regis iugulati sunt et ipse solus captus et catenatus est et regiones plurimas pro redemptione enimae suae illis tribuit, id est Estsaxum, Sutsaxum'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/histbrit.html].

It is probable that Saxon migrants had been colonizing the area for decades, and thus Saxons already heavily populated the region before the recorded dates of Hengist and Ælle. In late Roman times, the coast was already known as '''the Saxon Shore''': “The Saxon Shore Forts were built by the Romans in the late 3rd century AD along the southeast coast of Britain to guard against increasing invasion and piracy by Germanic tribes including the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes” [http://www.athenapub.com/saxshor1.htm]. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles were written in a dry, terse style for the purpose of informing rather than for entertaining, in contrast to the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] stories or the story of Beowulf. Although the Chronicle entry describing AElle were written many years later, it is a mistake to assume that it is entirely fiction.

There are no easy answers to questions such as 'Who invented the motor car’: it was a gradual process over decades. Likewise, the colonization of South East England by Germanic migrants was a gradual process. But there is a human need for simple answers to complex question. It is for this reason that myths arise. The British (Welsh) myths assume that the provinces were lost due to foul trickery by wicked rebel mercenaries, while the English myths revolve around heroic deeds by noble warriors.

Slightly more relevant is that German king Fraomar and his people were settled in Britain by the Emperor Valentinian a century before the supposed arrival of Ælle: “Another point of view which has grown up from unfortunately reading only the Saxon Chronicle, is that Continental immigration began suddenly with the ‘three keels’. The evidence of tradition, and of tribal names, shows that there had been a continual flow of population into Britain before the Roman age. The Atrebates, the Belgae, the Parisii, the Brigantes, and others, are equally familiar names on both sides of the channel. Nor was this process stopped even by Rome: it was only regulated. Rome brought over masses of troops largely recruited from the Continent, even to the Huns on the Wall. Aurelius brought multitudes of the Marcomanni to settle in Britain. Similarly did Probus, with the colonies of Vandals and Burgundians. The Franks raided the south and occupied London under Allectus. Constantine was accompanied by the king of the Alamanni - and doubtless a good following - when he came over to Britain. Valentinian removed Fraomar and his tribe of Alamanni into Britain.” [http://www.sedwards.demon.co.uk/kafs/news/Tysilio%20Flinders%20Petrie-uncut.rtf]. However, once independent Germanic (English) kingdoms were established, there was a large immigration of their tribespeople to the island of Britain.

:''For the concept ''Atari'' (&amp;#24403;&amp;#12383;&amp;#12426;) in the [[board game]] of [[Go (board game)|Go]], see [[Go terms#Atari|Atari (go term)]].''

'''Atari, Inc.''' {{NASDAQ|ATAR}} is a majority owned subsidiary of ''[[Infogrames Entertainment SA]]'' 
(IESA), encompassing its [[North America]]n operations. Atari develops, publishes and distributes games for all major [[video game console]]s, as well as for the [[personal computer]], and is currently one of the largest third-party publishers of [[Computer and video games|video games]] in the [[United States]].

The company that currently bears the Atari name was founded in 1993 under the name '''[[GT Interactive]]'''. GT Interactive was acquired by IESA in 1999 and renamed '''Infogrames, Inc.''' Infogrames acquired the Atari brand name from its purchase of [[Hasbro Interactive]], which in turn had acquired it from [[JT Storage|JTS Corporation]], which the original Atari had merged with in 1996. Infogrames, Inc. intermittently used the Atari name as a [[brand name]] for selected titles before IESA official changed the subsidiary's name to Atari, Inc. in 2003.

The original Atari was a pioneer in [[arcade game]]s, home [[video game console]]s, and [[personal computer]]s, and its dominance in those areas made it ''the'' major force in the [[computer]] entertainment industry in the early to mid-[[1980s]]. The brand has also been used at various times by [[Atari Games]], a separate company split off in 1984.

The name of the three-pronged Atari [[logo]] is &quot;Fuji&quot;.

==History==
[[Image:atari_logo.png|left|Original Atari logo]]
Since the early days of coin operated machines, Atari has been responsible for home consoles such as the [[Atari 2600]] (VCS); produced a series of [[Atari 8-bit family|eight-bit computers]] (Atari 400 &amp; 800); taken part in the 16 bit computer revolution with the [[Atari ST]]; made the revolutionary (for its time) 64-bit [[Atari Jaguar]]; and released a hand held video game console, the [[Atari Lynx]].

===The 1970s: The rise of a video game empire===
[[Image:Atari2600wood4.jpg|right|thumb| An early version of the Atari ''Video Computer System''.]]Founded in the United States in 1972 by [[Nolan Bushnell]] and Ted Dabney, Atari could be credited with starting the video arcade industry with the seminal [[PONG]]. The home version of PONG, which connected to a television set, was one of the first [[video game console]]s.

Atari Inc. was originally called [[Syzygy]], an astronomical term. However, as there already existed at least one company with that name (accounts varying as to whether it was a candle company or roofing company), Bushnell wrote down several words from the game [[Go (board game)|Go]], eventually choosing ''Atari'', a term that means that a [[Rules of go#Stones|stone]] or group of stones is in danger of being taken by one's opponent. The name &quot;Atari&quot; is arguably also rather more memorable in terms of spelling and pronunciation for most markets.

In 1973, Atari secretly spawned a &quot;competitor&quot; called [[Kee Games]], headed by long-time partner Joe Keenan, to circumvent the pinball distributor's insistence on exclusive distribution deals. Though the relationship to Atari was discovered in 1974, Joe Keenan did such a good job managing the subsidiary that he was promoted to president of Atari in 1974.

Bushnell sold Atari to [[Time-Warner|Warner Communications]] in 1976 for an estimated $28&amp;ndash;$32 million, using part of the money to buy the [[Folgers Mansion]]. He departed from the division in 1979. While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600 consoles. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and became the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States (at the time).

===The 1980s: Hurdles ahead===
Although the [[Atari 2600]] had garnered the lion's share of the home video game market, it experienced its first stiff competition in 1980 from [[Mattel|Mattel's]] [[Intellivision]], which featured ads touting its superior graphics capabilities relative to the 2600. Still, the 2600 remained the industry standard-bearer, due to its market superiority, and due to Atari featuring (by far) the greatest variety of game titles available.

However, Atari ran into problems in the early 1980s. Its [[home computer]], [[video game console]], and [[Video arcade|arcade]] divisions operated independently of one another and rarely cooperated. Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to follow on the success of the 2600. In 1982, Atari released disappointing versions of two highly publicized games, [[Pac-Man]] and [[E.T. (video game)|E.T.]], causing a pileup of unsold inventory and depressing prices. Also in 1982, Atari settled a court case with [[Activision]], a competing game developer primarily composed of disgruntled Atari ex-employees, officially opening the 2600 to third-party development. The market quickly became saturated, depressing prices further. In addition, in December 1982, Atari executives [[Ray Kassar]] and [[Dennis Groth]] were investigated for insider trading (later found to be false). Larry Emmons, employee No.3, retired in 1982. He was head of research and development of the small group of talented engineers in Grass Valley, California. The [[Atari 5200]] game console, released as a next-generation follow up to the 2600, was based on the [[Atari 800]] computer (but was incompatible with Atari 800 game cartridges), and its sales never met the company's expectations. It is rumored that in 1983, in response to a massive number of returned orders from distributors, [http://www.snopes.com/business/market/atari.asp Atari buried millions of unsold game cartridges] (the bulk of them consisting of two titles, Pac-Man and E.T.) in a [[New Mexico]] [[desert]] [[landfill]]. Howard Scott Warshaw (the programmer behind [[E.T. (video game)|E.T.]], [[Yars' Revenge]], [[Raiders of the Lost Ark (Atari 2600)|Raiders of the Lost Ark]], and [http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=2688 Saboteur]) [http://beepbopboop.heavysixer.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=67] still reflects fondly on his Atari days.

Still, Atari held a formidable position in the world video game market. They were the number one console maker in every market except [[Japan]], whose market belonged to [[Nintendo]], which had released their first game console, the [[Famicom]] (known to the rest of the world as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]) in 1983. The system took Japan by storm, and Nintendo began to look to other markets. They approached Atari and offered a licensing deal: Atari would build and sell the system, paying Nintendo a royalty. The deal was in the works, and the two companies tentatively decided to sign the agreement at the 1983 Summer [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]]. Unfortunately, at that same show [[Coleco]] was showing their new [[Coleco Adam|Adam computer]], and the display unit was running Nintendo's [[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]. But Atari owned the rights to publish Donkey Kong for computers. Atari CEO [[Ray Kassar]] had a fit, accusing Nintendo of double dealing with the Donkey Kong license. Nintendo in turn tore into Coleco, who only had the console rights to the game. In the coming month, Ray Kassar was forced to leave Atari, and executives involved in the Famicom deal were forced to start over again from scratch. 

These problems were followed by the infamous [[video game crash of 1983]], which caused losses that totaled more than $500 million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20, and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division. As for Nintendo, Atari could no longer afford the Famicom deal, and eventually Nintendo would be forced to go it alone.

In [[July 1984]], Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to [[Jack Tramiel]], the recently ousted founder of Atari competitor [[Commodore International]], under the name '''Atari Corporation''' for $240 million in stocks under the new company. Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name [[Atari Games]] and eventually selling it to [[Namco]] in 1985. Warner also sold the fledgling '''Ataritel''' to [[Mitsubishi]].

[[Image:Atari 1040STf.jpg|left|thumb|280px|Atari ST]]

Under Tramiel's ownership, '''Atari Corp.''' used the remaining stock of game console inventory to keep the company afloat while they finished development of their 16-bit computer system the [[Atari ST]]. In 1985 they released their update to the 8-bit computer line, the Atari XE series, as well as the 16-bit [[Atari ST]] line. Then, in 1986, Atari launched two consoles designed under the Warner Atari - Atari 2600jr and the [[Atari 7800]] console (which saw limited release in 1984). Atari rebounded, producing a $25 million profit that year. The Atari ST line proved very successful (but mostly in Europe, not the U.S.), ultimately selling more than 4 million units. It was especially popular among musicians, as it had built in [[MIDI]] ports. Still, its closest competitor in the marketplace, the [[Commodore Amiga]], outsold it 3 to 2. Atari eventually released a line of inexpensive [[IBM PC compatible]]s as well as an MS-DOS compatible palm computer called the Atari Portfolio.

In 1989, Atari also released the [[Atari Lynx]], a handheld console with color graphics, to critical acclaim. However, a shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season. As a result, the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo's [[Game Boy]], which had only a black and white display but was widely available. Also in 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly. Atari lost.

===The 1990s: Decline===
As the fortunes of Atari's ST and PC compatible computers faded, consoles and software again became the company's main focus. In 1993, Atari released its last console, the Jaguar. After a period of initial success, it, too, failed to meet expectations. It was not nearly as powerful as [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment's]] [[PlayStation]] or [[Sega|Sega's]] [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] and lacked the extensive third party support its Japanese competitors had easily secured for their consoles.

By 1996, a series of successful lawsuits followed by profitable investments had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank, but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari without any products to sell. In addition, Tramiel and his family wanted out. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. In July 1996, Atari merged with [[JT Storage|JTS Inc.]],a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, to form JTS Corp. Atari's role in the new company largely became a holder for the Atari properties and minor support, consequently the name largely disappeared from the market. 

Although the original Atari ceased to exist, a large amount of underground development remains for Atari's game systems and computers of the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]], and many of the retro-gaming conventions (such as World Of Atari, [[Classic Gaming Expo]], Philly Classic, and the Midwest Gaming Classic), focus largely on Atari. There are also websites dedicated to the release of new products for the original Atari consoles and computers, such as [[AtariAge]].

In [[March 1998]], JTS sold the Atari name and assets to Hasbro Interactive for $5 million&amp;mdash;less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. This transaction primarily involved the [[brand]] and [[intellectual property]], which now fell under the Atari Interactive division of Hasbro Interactive. The brand name changed hands again in [[December 2000]], when French software publisher [[Infogrames]] took over Hasbro Interactive.

In the meantime, [[Atari Games]] was bought out by its employees in 1986, who also founded [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]] to bring their arcade games in to the home. The new [[Time-Warner]] eventually started gaining more and more shares in the company until they eventually owned the company completely again by 1994. At that point Atari Games ceased to exist and became part of Time-Warner Interactive. By 1996, Time-Warner sold TWI to [[Williams (gaming company)|WMS Industries, Inc.]], owner of [[Midway Games|Midway]] at the time. WMS brought the properties under Midway (which it now renamed Midway Games Inc.), and re-instated the [[Atari Games]] name. In 1998, Midway was sold to its shareholders and spun off as a separate company. Over 1999-2000, Midway held closed door proceedings with Hasbro which ultimately led to Atari Games being renamed Midway Games West. Midway left the arcade industry in 2001, and shut down Midway Games West in 2003 - closing the chapter on what was left of the original Atari arcade division.

===The 2000s: Revival and re-release of Atari classics===
In [[October 2001]], [[Infogrames]] announced that it was &quot;reinventing&quot; the Atari brand with the launch of three new games. On [[May 7]], [[2003]], Infogrames officially reorganized its US subsidiary as a separate entity known as '''Atari, Inc.'''. It named its European operations to Atari Europe, and kept the main holdings company as Infogrames Entertainment.

[[Image:Atari Classics 10 in 1 TV Games.jpg|thumb|Atari 10-in-1 TV Game]]

In 2002, [[Jakks Pacific]], a toy making company, released a [[TV game|plug-and-play]] video game console called the Atari 10-in-1 TV Game, believed by many to arouse interest in the concept of self-contained entertainment devices that did not require separate hardware to operate. It was battery-operated and shaped similarly to an Atari 2600 joystick, and included A/V ports. In 2004, the same company created a device called Atari Paddle Games, in the shape of one of the 2600's &quot;paddle&quot; controllers with appropriate titles included. However, as stated, neither of the games were directly released by Atari.

[[Image:Atari Flashback Console.jpg|thumb|Atari Flashback Console]]

The same year that the Paddle Games were released, Atari released a TV game of their own which they called the [[Atari Flashback]] Console. The device they produced looked like a minute version of the Atari 7800 console originally released in 1984, 20 years previously. The two controllers were small as well, having a joystick and two red buttons on each side. Twenty titles were built into the system. Unlike most plug-and-plays, the Flashback was not powered by batteries, but an (included) AC adaptor instead. The Flashback did fairly well in sales; however, many Atari fans felt disappointed. Many people felt that the device itself was far too small, and the joysticks felt very dissimilar to those of the 7800. Since the games were all recreated on hardware more closely resembling the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] than the 7800, some of the aspects of certain games concerning the sound, graphics, or gameplay were either changed or omitted. Overall, many enthusiasts believed that the Flashback did not capture the true Atari experience.

Due to popular demand, Atari released a new version of the Flashback console, titled ''[[Atari Flashback 2]]'', in August 2005.

Also, in late October 2005, Atari released one of two collections of its classic arcade games only for the Nokia N-Gage console, titled Atari Masterpieces. Atari Masterpieces Volume I includes classic arcade games: Asteroids, Battlezone, Black Widow, Millipede, Missile Command, Red Baron, Lunar Lander and Super Breakout, and features an exclusive interview with Nolan Bushnell. Atari Masterpieces Volume II is scheduled to be released in March 2006.

==Atari's New Titles and Direction==
Recently, Atari's top-selling titles have been the [[Dragon Ball Z]] games based on the popular anime license from [[Toei Animation]] in [[Japan]]. These include the [[Dragon Ball Z: Budokai]] series of games for next-generation console systems and the [[Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku]] series of games for the Game Boy Advance. These games have topped the [[List of best selling computer and video games|best-seller charts]] for numerous console platforms since the release of Atari's first [[Dragon Ball Z]] game, [[Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku|The Legacy of Goku]] in 2002, which was the first [[Dragon Ball]] game to be made by an American company, [[Webfoot Technologies]], and is one of the [[List of best selling computer and video games|best-selling]] Game Boy Advance games of all time (#16). The best selling [[Budokai]] series is developed in Japan by [[Dimps]] and includes [[Dragon Ball Z: Budokai]], [[Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2]], [[Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3]] and [[Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi]]. Following the success of the Budokai and Legacy of Goku series, Atari has released numerous other Dragon Ball titles including [[Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors]], [[Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors 2]], [[Dragon Ball Z: Sagas]], [[Dragon Ball GT: Transformation]] and [[Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout]].

Atari also released a series of games based on the smash-hit [[The Matrix]] movie trilogy including [[Enter the Matrix]] and [[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]. These titles represent some of the most expensive video games ever developed. [[Enter the Matrix]] which was developed by [[Shiny Entertainment]] sold 1.38 million units for the Sony [[PlayStation 2]] and 1 million units for the [[Nintendo GameCube]], therefore it made the [[List of best selling computer and video games]].

Other currently popular titles for Atari include the [[RollerCoaster Tycoon]] and [[Driver (video game)|Driver]] series.

'''Acadia University''' is a [[university]] located in [[Wolfville, Nova Scotia|Wolfville]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. It began as Horton Academy (1828), which was founded by [[Baptists]] from Nova Scotia. The two major Universities of the day in Nova Scotia were heavily controlled by Denominational structures. King's College ([[University of King's College]]) was an [[Anglican]] School and [[Dalhousie University]], which was originally non-denominational, had placed itself under the control and direction of the [[Church of Scotland]]. It was the failure of Dalhousie to appoint a prominent Baptist pastor and scholar, Edmund Crawley, to the Chair of [[Classics]], as had been expected, that really thrust into the forefront of Baptist thinking the need for a College established and run by the Baptists.

In 1838, the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society founded Queen's College (named for Queen Victoria). The College began with 21 students in January 1839. The name &quot;Queen's College&quot; was denied to the Baptist school, so it was renamed &quot;Acadia College&quot; in 1841, in reference to the history of the area as an [[Acadian]] settlement. It became a university in 1891.

The Granville Street Baptist Church (now [[First Baptist Church Halifax]]) was an instrumental and determining factor in the founding of the University. It has played a supporting role throughout its history, and shares much of the credit for its survival and development. &quot;Together, we should feel a great sense of pride in what we have built,&quot; said former AU President Dr. [[Kelvin Ogilvie]] in some remarks to the congregation on April 16, 2000.

In marking the 50th anniversary of the latest church building, Dr. Ogilvie delivered a fitting tribute to the congregation. Many members are graduates of Acadia University and have been associated with the [[Acadia Divinity College]]. &quot;This unique relationship between [[Acadia Divinity College]] and Acadia University is an important one; one which we must work to preserve,&quot; commented Dr. Ogilvie.

Many individuals who have made significant contributions to Acadia University, including the first president [[John Pryor]], were members of the [[First Baptist Church Halifax]] congregation.

The original charter as a college stated:

''And be it further enacted, that no religious tests or subscriptions shall be required of the Professors Fellows, Scholars, Graduates or Officers of the said College; but that all the privileges and advantages thereof shall be open and free to all and every Person and Persons whomsoever, without regard to religious persuasion... And it shall and may be lawful for the trustees and Governors of the said College to select as Professors, and other Teaches or Officers, competent persons of any religious persuasion whatever, provided such person or persons shall be of moral and religious character.''

This was unique at the time, and a direct result of Baptists being denied entry into other schools that required religious tests of their students and staff. 

[[As of 2005]], Acadia has approximately 4,000 students. Some would consider Acadia University's most outstanding factor to be its Acadia Advantage programme.  The initiative (which was unique in Canada for several years after beginning in 1996) integrates the use of [[laptop computers]], which are loaned to all students, into the [[undergraduate]] curriculum.  Acadia also has the highest tuition in Canada, in part because of the additional fees students must pay to participate in the Acadia Advantage programme.

[[As of 2005]], Acadia's president is [[Gail Dinter-Gottlieb]]; she took on her position after the retirement of past president [[Kelvin Ogilvie]] in 2003.  In February and March of 2004, Acadia experienced its first ever [[Strike action|strike]] by the faculty.  Professors and librarians were off the job for two weeks before they reached a settlement.

The university is also home to the [[Baptist]] [[Seminary]] [[Acadia Divinity College]].

Acadia's sports teams are called the [[Acadia Axemen|Axemen]] and [[Acadia Axewomen|Axewomen]].  They participate in the Atlantic University Sports conference of [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]].

===The Acadia Advantage=== 
The Acadia Advantage is an academic programme unique in Canada whereby each of the undergraduate (and many of the graduate) students receive [[laptop]] computers to use from September to May. Honours students may use their computers in the summer before their last year. Other students have the option to rent their laptops over the summer months. From 1996-2004, the university had a contract with [[IBM]]; the 2004-2005 year saw a shift to the [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]] Lattitude D600 computers.

Throughout the entirety of the Acadia Advantage program, the following laptops have been employed, each for a two year &quot;turnover&quot; (lease) period:&lt;br&gt;

*IBM Thinkpad 365ED
*IBM Thinkpad 365XD
*IBM Thinkpad 385ED
*IBM Thinkpad iSeries (exact model unsure)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
*IBM Thinkpad a20m
*IBM Thinkpad r31
*Dell Lattitude D600

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;The iSeries based laptop was used as a stop-gap measure for the 98-99 semesters, as the 1998 enrollment numbers outstripped the number of available 385ED laptops already in use.

Currently, an insurance policy is available through the [http://bartleby.acadiau.ca:7778/pls/portal/usc.usc_home_proc USC] (User Support Centre), the university's first and only point of contact for hardware and software technical support.  This insurance policy, a &quot;total care package&quot; will cover most all accidental damage to the laptops.  This is a boon to the student body, as the fast pace of university life, coupled with general lack of regard towards the laptops, results in hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage each year.

Students come to Acadia with different computer backgrounds, but almost every student leaves with some highly developed computer skills. Students have access to resources like the User Support Centre, and faculty receive a lot of support from the [[Acadia Institute for Teaching and Technology]]. 

Most of the classrooms at Acadia are equipped with ergonomic chairs, [[acoustics|acoustic]] tile, data projectors, and network drops or wireless network access. There are over 7,000 data connections on the campus, and many areas support wireless internet access including the Student Union Building ([[Acadia Students' Union]]), the [[Vaughan Memorial Library]], the [[Acadia Divinity College]], and the [[KC Irving Centre]] (named for [[Kenneth Colin Irving|K.C. Irving]]).

Former Acadia President Dr. Kelvin Ogilvie, explains, &quot;We are moving the classroom into a new, dynamic, and exciting environment that brings students and faculty together in a fashion that has never before occurred. The dynamism of the classroom is unprecedented. The possibilities are limited only by the imagination.&quot;

The Acadia Advantage Programme has received recognition from the [[Smithsonian]] Institution, and is part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. In addition, [[Acadia University]] received the Pioneer Award for Ubiquitous Computing in 2001, it has achieved high rankings in the annual ''[[Maclean's]]'' University Rankings, including Best Overall for Primarily Undergraduate University in their opinion survey, and it received the Canadian Information Productivity Award in 1997 as it was praised as the first university in Canada to fully utilize information technology in the undergraduate curriculum.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AcousticGuitar.jpg|right|Acoustic Guitar]]
An '''acoustic guitar''' is a modern form of [[Guitar|guitar]] descended from the [[Classical guitar]], but generally strung with steel strings for a brighter, louder sound.  Much heavier construction is required to withstand the added tension.  Sometimes the term '''steel-stringed guitar''' or '''folk guitar''' is used to differentiate from the classical guitar. The term &quot;acoustic guitar&quot; is a [[retronym]], since before the invention of the [[electric guitar|electric]] instrument, &quot;guitar&quot; meant only the non-amplified variety.

[[Image:Playing acoustic guitar.jpg|right|thumb|Playing an acoustic guitar without a pick ([[fingerpicking]])]]

There are many different variations on the construction of and materials used in acoustic guitars. More expensive guitars feature solid wood tops (often [[spruce]]), sides and backs (often Indian [[rosewood]], [[maple]], or [[mahogany]]). Lower-priced guitars can combine solid tops with [[laminate]]d backs and/or sides. Entry-level guitars are usually made entirely of laminated wood. Necks are generally made of mahogany (either Phillipine or Honduras), and [[fingerboards]] are usually made of dense tropical hardwoods such as rosewood or [[ebony]]. The various combinations of the different woods and their quality, along with design and construction elements (for example, how the top is braced) are among the factors affecting the [[timbre]] or &quot;tone&quot; of the guitar. Due to decreasing availability and rising prices of the premium-quality woods, many manufacturers have begun experimenting with alternate species of woods or more commonly available variations on the standard species. For example, some makers have begun producing models with [[redcedar]] or mahogany tops. Some have also begun using non-wood materials, such as [[plastic]] or [[graphite]]. Most [[luthier]]s and experienced players agree that a solid top is the most important factor in the tone of the guitar, and that solid backs and sides can also contribute to a pleasant sound, although laminated sides and backs are acceptable alternatives.  Some [[jazz]] players prefer laminated backs and sides (please see [[Guitar]] for more details on the construction of acoustic guitars).

Another style of acoustic guitar is the [[archtop guitar]].  This is most commonly used by swing and jazz players, and often incorporates electronics in the form of a [[pickup (music)|pickup]].

There are several prominent [[United States of America|American]] makers of acoustic guitars.  [[Martin Guitars|Martin]], [[Guild]], [[Taylor Guitars|Taylor]], and [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] are known for both the quality and price of their instruments.
The [[Selmer-Maccaferri Guitar]] is an unusual looking guitar played by [[Django Reinhardt]] style musicians, distinctive by its &quot;D&quot; hole or longitudinal oval soundhole. 

The standard tuning for an acoustic guitar is EADGBE (low to high), although many players, particularly fingerpickers, use alternate tunings, such as &quot;Open G&quot; (DGDGBD), &quot;[[open D tuning]]&quot; (DADF#AD), or &quot;Drop D&quot; (DADGBE).

One variation on the standard acoustic guitar is the [[12 string guitar]], which sports an additional doubling string for each of the traditional six strings.  This guitar was made famous by artists such as Huddie Leadbetter (a.k.a. [[Leadbelly]]), [[Pete Seeger]], and [[Leo Kottke]].

Throughout the 20th century the predominant forms of music played on the most common type of acoustic guitar (the flattop steel-string guitar) remained relatively stable and included acoustic [[blues]], [[country music|country]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[folk music|folk]], and several genres of [[rock (music)|rock]].  In the last decade or two more intricate fingerstyle guitar music, rooted in [[European classical music|classical music]], [[Celtic music]], and American styles and characterized by musicians such as '''Al Petteway''', '''Alex de Grassi''', and [[Pierre Bensusan]], has become popular enough that several luthiers have been experimenting with redesigning the acoustic guitar.  These flat top steel-string guitars are constructed and voiced more for classical-like [[fingerpicking]] and less for chordal accompaniment.  Luthiers such as '''Kevin Ryan''', '''Stefan Sobell''', and '''George Lowden''' have increasingly focused their attention on the needs of fingerstylists and have developed unique guitars for this style of playing.

      <comment>disambiguation from [[Knights Templar]] to [[Knights Templar (military order)]] - ([[WP:DPL|You can help!]])</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Johannes XXIII Gegenpapst.jpg|thumb|Antipope John XXIII]]'''Antipope John XXIII''', [[antipope]] of the [[Pisa]]n party ([[1410]]&amp;ndash;[[1415]]), (about [[1370]] &amp;ndash; [[November 22]], [[1419]]), was born as '''Baldassare Cossa'''.

Cardinal Baldassare Cossa was one of the seven [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s who, in May of [[1408]], deserted [[Pope Gregory XII]], and, with those belonging to the obedience of [[Antipope Benedict XIII]], convened the [[Council of Pisa]], of which Cossa became the leader. They elected [[Pope Alexander V]] in [[1409]]. Cossa succeeded him a year later.

[[Edward Gibbon]] asserts in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' that John XXIII was charged with [[piracy]], [[murder]], [[rape]], [[sodomy]], and [[incest]], with the more serious charges being suppressed. Of course, this needs to be viewed in the light of the political situation of the time, as the charges were likely trumped up; note the similarity to the charges against the [[Knights Templar (military order)|Knights Templar]]. 

He should not be confused with [[Pope John XXIII]] of the [[20th century]]. The fact that for more than 500 years there was no Pope named John (vs. 23 in 1400 years) is probably due to the controversial figure this (anti)Pope represented.  When Pope John XXIII was elected, there was some confusion as to whether or not he would be ''John XXIII'' or ''John XXIV''. John then declared that he was John XXIII to put this question to rest. The decision of the 20th century Pope John XXIII not to be named John XXIV as might be expected serves as a confirmation of the antipope status of this first John XXIII. It should be noted, however, that the numbering of the Popes called John is debatable; for example, Gibbon refers to the Antipope John as John XXII.

The [[North America]]n student [[fraternity]] [[Kappa Sigma]] claims that its origins stem from Cossa's governorship of [[Bologna]], where his campaign of assault and robbery against the students of the [[University of Bologna]] led to a secret organization under the teacher [[Manuel Chrysoloras]] for mutual protection against Cossa's brigands.

After the events of the [[Council of Constance]] (1415), he was freed from prison in Germany by Martin V in 1418 and later died as cardinal bishop of [[Tusculum]] in 1419.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Astounding Stories''''' was a seminal [[science fiction]] [[magazine]] founded in [[1930]] and initially published by [[Street &amp; Smith]].  ''Astounding Stories of Super-Science'', first edited by [[Harry Bates (author)|Harry Bates]], is generally considered the forum where modern [[science fiction]] was created.  It has changed names repeatedly, most importantly in 1938 to ''Astounding Science-Fiction'', and then in the 1960s to '''''Analog Science Fiction and Science Fact''''', under which name it is still published. The word &quot;and&quot; was sometimes replaced in the logo by a pseudo-[[mathematical symbol]] comprising a horizontal right-pointing arrow piercing an inverted U-shape. The symbol, apparently invented by Campbell, was said to mean &quot;analogous to.&quot;

[[Image:Astounding Grey Lensman.png|thumb|180px|left|&quot;Grey Lensman&quot; by [[E. E. Smith]] in ''Astounding'', Oct. 1939]]
Following 8 years of publication under two different editors, the magazine's helm was assumed by [[John W. Campbell]], who took over in [[1937]].  Campbell retitled it ''Astounding Science-Fiction'' and brought an unprecedented insistence on placing equal emphasis on both words of &quot;science fiction.&quot; No longer satisfied with gadgetry and action alone, Campbell demanded that his writers think out how science and technology might really develop in the future - and, most important, how those changes would affect the lives of human beings.

The new sophistication soon made ''Astounding'' the undisputed leader in the field. Campbell later began to think the old title was too &quot;sensational&quot; or &quot;juvenile&quot; to reflect what the magazine was actually doing, so he initially de-emphasized the word &quot;Astounding&quot; by having it printed in narrow script above the bold words &quot;SCIENCE FICTION,&quot; and then renamed the magazine ''Analog'' in [[1960]]. Over the course of a year the title logo was changed; the large initial &quot;A&quot; stayed the same while the letters &quot;stounding&quot; were faded down and the letters &quot;nalog&quot; faded up on top of them. Bibliographers often abbreviate the magazine as ''ASF'', which can of course stand for either title.

[[Ben Bova]] took over as editor after Campbell died suddenly in [[1971]], and was himself succeeded by [[Stanley Schmidt]] in [[1978]].

Due to the economics of the magazine publishing industry (i.e. not much money in the budget), ''Analog'' frequently prints material from previously unknown authors, and has launched the careers of popular contributors within the genre (e.g. [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[Ender's Game]]'' in the [[1970s]], and early work by [[Harry Turtledove]] in the [[1980s]].)

Each year, ''Analog'' conducts a readers' poll—called the Analytical Laboratory, or AnLab—to determine the favorite stories, articles and cover art published in the magazine in the previous year.  Many recipients of the AnLab Award have gone on to receive the much-coveted [[Hugo Award]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:salieri.jpg|thumb|Antonio Salieri]]
'''Antonio Salieri''' ([[August 18]], [[1750]] &amp;ndash; [[May 7]], [[1825]]), born in [[Legnago]], [[Italy]], was a [[composer]] and [[Conducting|conductor]], as well as one of the most important and famous musicians of his time.

== Biography ==   
    
Raised in a prosperous family of merchants, Salieri studied [[violin]] and [[harpsichord]] with his brother Francesco, who was a student of [[Giuseppe Tartini]]. After the early death of his parents, he moved to [[Padua]], then to [[Venice]], where he studied [[thoroughbass]] with Giovanni Battista Pescetti. There he met Florian Leopold Gassmann in 1766, who invited him to attend the court of [[Vienna]] and there trained him in composition based on [[Johann Joseph Fux|Fux]]'s ''Gradus ad Parnassum''. He remained in Vienna for the remainder of his life. In 1774, after Gassmann's death, Salieri was appointed court composer by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]]. He met his wife, Therese von Helfersdorfer, in 1774. (The couple went on to have eight children.) Salieri became Imperial Royal [[Kapellmeister]] in 1788, a post which he held till 1824. He was president of the &quot;Tonkünstler-Societät&quot; (society of musical artists) from 1788 to 1795, vice-president after 1795, and in charge of its concerts until 1818.   
    
He attained an elevated social standing, and was frequently associated with other celebrated composers like [[Joseph Haydn]] or [[Louis Spohr]]. He had important roles in [[1800s|19th century]] [[European classical music|classical music]]: he taught famous composers like [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Carl Czerny]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], [[Ignaz Moscheles]], [[Franz Schubert]] and [[Franz Xaver Süssmayr]]. He also taught Mozart's younger son, [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart|Franz Xaver]].

Salieri was buried in the Matzleinsdorfer Friedhof (his remains were later transferred to the [[Zentralfriedhof]]) in [[Vienna, Austria]]. At his funeral service his own Requiem in C minor - composed in 1804 - was performed for the first time. His monument is adorned by a poem written by [[Joseph Weigl]], one of his pupils:   

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Rest in peace! Uncovered by dust'' &lt;br /&gt;
''eternity shall bloom for you.'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Rest in peace! In eternal harmonies'' &lt;br /&gt;
''your spirit now is dissolved.'' &lt;br /&gt;
''He expressed himself in enchanting notes,'' &lt;br /&gt;
''now he is floating to everlasting beauty.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Works ==
{{main|List of compositions by Antonio Salieri}}

During his time in Vienna, Salieri acquired great prestige as a composer and conductor, particularly of [[opera]], but also of [[chamber music|chamber]] and [[sacred music]]. The most successful of his more than 40 operas included ''Armida'' (1771), ''La scuola de' gelosi'' (1778), ''Der Rauchfangkehrer'' (1781), ''Les Danaïdes'' (1784), which was first presented as a work of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s, ''[[Tarare]]'' (1787), ''Axur, Re d'Ormus'' (1788), ''Palmira, Regina di Persia'' (1795), and ''Falstaff o sia Le tre burle'' (1799). He wrote comparatively little instrumental music, including two [[piano concerto]]s and a concerto for [[organ (music)|organ]] written in 1773, a concerto for [[flute]], [[oboe]] and orchestra (1774), and a set of 26 variations on ''La Follia di Spagna'' (1815).

== Salieri and Mozart ==

In Vienna in the 1790s, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] mentioned several &quot;cabals&quot; of Salieri concerning his new opera ''[[Così fan tutte]]''. As Mozart's music became more popular over the decades, Salieri's music was forgotten, and Mozart's allegations gained credence and tarnished Salieri's reputation. At the beginning of the 19th century, increasing [[nationalism]] led to a tendency to transfigure the [[Austria|Austrian]] Mozart's [[genius]], while the [[Italy|Italian]] Salieri was given the role of his evil [[antagonist]]. [[Albert Lortzing]]'s ''Singspiel'' ''Szenen aus Mozarts Leben'' LoWV28 (1832) uses the cliché of the jealous Salieri trying to hinder Mozart's career. While Italian by birth, Salieri had lived in imperial Vienna since he was 16 years old and was regarded as a German composer. In 1772, Empress [[Maria Theresia]] made a comment on her preference to Italian composers over Germans like Gassmann, Salieri or [[Gluck]]. Salieri saw himself as a German composer, which some of his German letters, operas, cantatas, and songs seem to prove.

The biographer Alexander Wheelock Thayer believes that Mozart's suspicions of Salieri could have originated with an incident in 1781 when Mozart applied to be the music teacher of the Princess of Württemberg, and Salieri was selected instead because of his good reputation as a singing teacher. In the following year Mozart once again failed to be selected as the Princess's piano teacher.

Later on, when Mozart's ''[[The Marriage of Figaro|Le Nozze di Figaro]]'' was not well received by either the Emperor Joseph II or by the public, Mozart blamed Salieri for the failure. ''&quot;Salieri and his tribe will move heaven and earth to put it down&quot;'', [[Leopold Mozart]] wrote to his daughter Nannerl. But at the time of the premiere of ''Figaro'', Salieri was busy with his new [[French language|French]] opera ''Les Horaces''. Thayer believes that the intrigues surrounding the failure of ''Figaro'' were instigated by the poet Giovanni Battista Casti against the Court Poet, [[Lorenzo da Ponte]], who wrote the ''Figaro'' [[libretto]].

Later, when da Ponte was in [[Prague]] preparing the production of Mozart's setting of his ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', the poet was ordered back to Vienna for a royal wedding for which Salieri's ''Axur, Re d'Ormus'' would be performed. Obviously, Mozart was not pleased by this. 

There is far more evidence of a cooperative atmosphere between the two composers than for a real enmity. For example, Mozart appointed Salieri to teach his son Franz Xavier, and when Salieri was appointed Kapellmeister in [[1788 in music|1788]], he revived ''Figaro'' instead of bringing out a new opera of his own, and when he went to the coronation festivities for Leopold II in 1790 he had no less than three Mozart masses in his luggage. Salieri and Mozart even composed a song for voice and piano together, called ''Per la ricuperata salute di Ophelia'', which was celebrating the happy return to stage of the famous singer Nancy Storace. This song has been lost, although it had been printed by Artaria in 1785. Mozart's ''Davidde penitente'' K.469 (1785), his piano concerto in E flat major K.482 (1785), the clarinet quintet K.581 (1789) and the great symphony in G minor K.550 had been premiered on the suggestion of Salieri, who even conducted a performance of it in 1791. In his last surviving letter from October 14th 1791, Mozart tells his wife about Salieri's attendance at his opera ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' K 620, speaking enthusiastically: ''&quot;He heard and saw with all his attention, and from the ouverture to the last choir there was no piece that didn't elicit a bravo or bello out of him [...]&quot;''

Salieri's health declined in his later years, and he was hospitalized shortly before his death. It was shortly after he died that rumors first spread that he had confessed to Mozart's murder on his deathbed. Salieri's two nurses, Gottlieb Parsko and Georg Rosenberg, as well as his family doctor Joseph Röhrig, attested that he never said any such thing. At least one of these three people were with him throughout his hospitalization.

After Salieri's death in 1825, [[Aleksandr Pushkin]]'s drama ''Mozart i Salieri'' (1831) and the opera setting of this work by [[Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] ([[1898]]) started a tradition of poetic license based on Mozart's allegations, continued and popularized by [[Peter Shaffer]]'s heavily fictionalized play ''[[Amadeus]]'' (1979) and the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning 1984 film by [[Milos Forman]] based on it, in which [[F. Murray Abraham]] played Salieri and [[Tom Hulce]] played the title character. Both Schaffer and Foreman expressly maintained the fictional nature of their respective works, and while it is never explicitly stated in the play that Salieri killed Mozart, he is portrayed as bitterly hating his rival, going so far as to renounce God for blessing Mozart (portrayed in the play as an immature dandy) with fantastic talent while refusing to let ''him'' be anything but &quot;a mediocrity.&quot;  

Due largely to Schaffer's play and its movie adaptation, the word &quot;Salieri&quot; has entered the public consciousness to mean a merely competent artist standing in the shadow of a genius.

== Recent Popularity ==

In 2003, [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Cecilia Bartoli]] released ''The Salieri Album'', a CD with 13 arias from Salieri's operas, most of which had never been recorded before. Since 2000 there have also been complete recordings issued of the operas [[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]], [[Les Danaides]], and [[La Grotta di Trofonio]]. Although he has yet to fully re-enter the standard repertory, performances of Salieri's works are becoming more and more common.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Activism''', in a general sense, can be described as intentional action to bring about [[social change|social]] or [[politics|political]] change. This action is in support of, or opposition to, one side of an often [[controversy|controversial]] argument.

The word &quot;activism&quot; is often used [[synonymous]]ly with [[protest]] or [[dissent]], but activism can stem from any number of political orientations and take a wide range of forms, from writing letters to newspapers or politicians, simply [[Economic activism|shopping ethically]], rallies and [[demonstration|street marches]], [[direct action]], or even [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]]. In the more confrontational cases, an activist may be called a [[freedom fighter]] by some, and a [[terrorism|terrorist]] by others, depending on which side of the political fence is making the observation.

Since the 2004 elections and controversy over [[gay marriage]] in the United States, &quot;activist&quot; has often been used as a [[pejorative]] for those who seek to redress [[social injustice|social ills]] through [[lawsuit|legal]] rather than [[legislation|legislative]] action. Thus many [[American conservatism|conservative]] politicians have sought to curb the power of those deemed &quot;activist [[judge]]s&quot; whom they claim are acting outside traditional boundaries of [[judicial review]] [http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0413/p15s02-usju.html]. Some [[American liberalism|liberal]]s contend that [[judicial activism]] is in a long-standing US legal tradition, while others have responded that judicial activism is more prevalent among judges deemed conservative [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/opinion/06gewirtz.html?ex=1278302400&amp;en=0e5fac7774080327&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Atomicclock.jpg|thumb|250px|Atomic clock]]
[[Image:ChipScaleClock2 HR.jpg|thumb|250px|Chip-Scale Atomic Clock Unveiled by NIST]]
An '''atomic clock''' is a type of [[clock]] that uses an [[atom]]ic resonance frequency standard as its counter.  Early atomic clocks were [[maser]]s with attached equipment. Today's best atomic frequency standards (or clocks) are based on more advanced physics involving cold atoms and atomic fountains.   
National standards agencies maintain an accuracy of 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt; seconds per day, and a precision equal to the frequency of the radio transmitter pumping the maser.  The clocks maintain a continuous and stable time scale, [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI).  For civil time, another time scale is disseminated, [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). UTC is derived from TAI, but synchronized with the passing of day and night based on astronomical observations.

The first atomic clock was built in [[1949]] at the U.S. [[National Bureau of Standards]]. The first accurate atomic clock, based on the transition of the [[caesium]]-133 atom, was built by [[Louis Essen]] in [[1955]] at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. This led to the internationally agreed definition of the [[second]] being based on atomic time.

In [[August 2004]], [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] scientists demonstrated a chip-scaled atomic clock. According to the researchers, the clock was believed to be one hundredth the size of any other. It was also claimed that it requires just 75 [[milliwatt|mW]], making it suitable for [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-driven applications.

Modern [[radio clock]]s are referenced to atomic clocks, and provide a way of getting high-quality atomic-derived time over a wide area using inexpensive equipment; however, radio clocks are not appropriate for high-precision, scientific work.

==How they work ==

Frequency reference [[maser]]s use glowing chambers of [[ion (physics)|ion]]ized gas, most often [[caesium]], because caesium is the [[Chemical element|element]] used in the official international definition of the [[second]].  

Since 1967, the International System of Units ([[SI]]) has defined the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation which corresponds to the transition between two energy levels of the ground state of the Caesium-133 atom. 
This definition makes the caesium oscillator (often called an atomic clock) the primary standard for time and frequency measurements (see [[caesium standard]]). Other physical quantities, like the [[volt]] and [[metre]], rely on the definition of the second as part of their own definitions.

The core of the atomic clock is a [[microwave]] cavity containing the ionized gas, a tunable microwave [[radio]] oscillator, and a [[PID loop|feedback loop]] which is used to adjust the oscillator to the exact frequency of the absorption characteristic defined by the behavior of the individual atoms.

The microwave transmitter fills the chamber with a standing wave of [[radio wave]]s. When the radio frequency matches the [[hyperfine transition]] frequency of caesium, the caesium atoms absorb the radio waves and emit [[light]].  The radio waves make the [[electron]]s move farther from their [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]].  When the electrons are attracted back closer by the opposite [[electric charge|charge]] of the nucleus, the electrons wiggle before they settle down in their new location.  This moving charge causes the light, which is a wave of alternating [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]].

A [[photocell]] looks at the light. When the light gets dimmer because the frequency of the excitation has drifted from the true resonance frequency, [[electronics]] between the photocell and radio transmitter adjusts the frequency of the radio transmitter. 

This adjustment process is where most of the work and complexity of the clock lies.  The adjustment tries to eliminate unwanted side-effects, such as frequencies from other electron transitions, distortions in quantum fields and temperature effects in the mechanisms. For example, the radio wave's frequency could be deliberately cycled sinusoidally up and down to generate a modulated signal at the photocell.  The photocell's signal can then be demodulated to apply feedback to control long-term drift in the radio frequency. In this way, the ultra-precise quantum-mechanical properties of the atomic transition frequency of the caesium can be used to tune the microwave oscillator to the same frequency (except for a small amount of experimental error). In practice, the feedback and monitoring mechanism is much more complex than described above.   
When a clock is first turned on, it takes a while for it to settle down before it can be trusted.  
[[Image:Clock accurcy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Historical accuracy of atomic clocks from [[NIST]].]]
A counter counts the waves made by the radio transmitter. 
A computer reads the counter, and does math to convert the number to something that looks like a digital clock, or a radio wave that is transmitted. 
Of course, the real clock is the original mechanism of cavity, oscillator and feedback loop that maintains the frequency standard on which the clock is based.

A number of other atomic clock schemes are in use for other purposes.  [[Rubidium]] clocks are prized for their low cost, small size (commercial standards are as small as 400 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and short term stability.  They are used in many commercial, portable and aerospace applications.  [[Hydrogen]] [[maser]]s (often manufactured in [[Russia]]) have superior short term stability to other standards, but lower long term accuracy.

Often, one standard is used to fix another.  For example, some commercial applications use a Rubidium standard slaved to a [[GPS]] receiver.  This achieves excellent short term accuracy, with long term accuracy equal to (and traceable to) the U.S. national time standards.

The lifetime of a standard is an important practical issue.  Modern Rubidium standard tubes last more than ten years, and can cost as little as $50 US.  Caesium reference tubes suitable for national standards currently last about seven years, and cost about $35,000 US.  Hydrogen standards have an unlimited lifetime.

==Research==

Most research focuses on way to make the clocks smaller, cheaper, more accurate, and more reliable.  These goals usually conflict.

A lot of research currently focuses on various sorts of ion traps.  Theoretically, a single ion suspended electromagnetically could be observed for very long periods, increasing the accuracy of the clock, while also reducing its size and power consumption.  

In practice, single-ion clocks have poor short term accuracy because the ion moves so much.  Current research uses [[laser cooling]] of ions, with optical resonators to increase the short term stability of the driving optics.  Much of the difficulty is related to eliminating temperature and mechanical [[Noise (physics)|noise effects]] in the resonators and lasers. No laser has achieved wide use.  The result is that the ion trap is very small, but the supporting equipment is still large.

Some researchers developed clocks with different geometries of ion traps, as well.  Linear clouds of ions usually have better short term accuracy than single ions.  There are trade-offs.

The best developed systems use [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] ions.  Some researchers experiment with other ions.  A particular isotope of [[Ytterbium]] has a particularly precise resonant frequency in one of its hyperfine transitions.  [[Strontium]] has a hyperfine transition that is not as precise, but can be driven by solid-state lasers.  This might permit a very inexpensive, long-lasting compact clock.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Atlantic Avenue Tunnel''' (or '''Cobble Hill Tunnel''' of the [[Long Island Rail Road]]) is an abandoned railroad tunnel beneath Atlantic Avenue in downtown [[Kings County, New York|Brooklyn, New York]]. When open, it ran for about 2750 feet (830&amp;nbsp;m) between Hicks Street and Boerum Place.

It was opened on [[December 3]], [[1844]] and was finished by [[January 1]], [[1845]], as an open cut--that is, a reinforced trench open to the sky. It was built to reduce the grade of the railroad line on its way to the South Ferry at the foot of Atlantic Street (now Avenue), from which passenger could catch ferries to [[Manhattan|New York County]].

Five years later a &quot;sturdy brick arch&quot; was placed over the cut, making it a true tunnel. As built, the tunnel was 21 feet (6.4&amp;nbsp;m) wide, 17 feet (5.1&amp;nbsp;m) high and 1,611 feet (491&amp;nbsp;m) long.

Insofar as it carried railroad trains under a city street, it could be described as a [[subway]] tunnel, though unlike a modern [[rapid transit]] subway, it had no stations. The similar [[Murray Hill Tunnel]] on the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] was roofed over in the [[1850s]]. The ends of the tunnel were sealed in the fall of [[1861]].

In March 1916, the FBI suspected German terrorists were making bombs in the tunnel, and broke through. They found nothing, installed an electric light, and resealed the tunnel.  In the 1920s the tunnel was reportedly used for both mushroom growing and bootleg whiskey stills. In 1936, New York City police broke into the tunnel with jackhammers to look for the body of a hoodlum supposedly buried there. In 1941 the tunnel was again inspected by the federal [[Works Progress Administration]] to determine its structural strength. A few years later, it was once again opened, this time by the FBI, in an unsuccessful search for spies. During the late 1950s it was inspected by two rail historians, George Horn and Martin Schachne.

It fell into myth, but was rediscovered by the then-18-year-old [[Bob Diamond|Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Diamond]] in 1981, who entered from a manhole at Atlantic and Court Street. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1989.

[[Walt Whitman]] wrote of the tunnel:
:The old tunnel, that used to lie there under ground, a passage of Acheron-like solemnity and darkness, now all closed and filled up, and soon to be utterly forgotten, with all its reminiscences; however, there will, for a few years yet be many dear ones, to not a few Brooklynites, New Yorkers, and promiscuous crowds besides. For it was here you started to go down the island, in summer. For years, it was confidently counted on that this spot, and the railroad of which it was the terminus, were going to prove the permanent seat of business and wealth that belong to such enterprises. But its glory, after enduring in great splendor for a season, has now vanished&amp;mdash;at least its Long Island Railroad glory has. The tunnel: dark as the grave, cold, damp, and silent. How beautiful look earth and heaven again, as we emerge from the gloom! It might not be unprofitable, now and then, to send us mortals&amp;mdash;the dissatisfied ones, at least, and that's a large proportion&amp;mdash;into some tunnel of several days' journey. We'd perhaps grumble less, afterward, at God's handiwork.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Annapolis Valley''' is a valley in western [[Nova Scotia]], formed by a trough between two parallel mountain ranges along the shore of the [[Bay of Fundy]].

==Geography==
The Annapolis Valley measures approximately 150 [[kilometre|km]] in length from [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]] and the [[Annapolis Basin]] in the west to [[Wolfville, Nova Scotia|Wolfville]] and the [[Minas Basin]] in the east, spanning the counties of [[Digby County, Nova Scotia|Digby]], [[Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Annapolis]] and [[Kings County, Nova Scotia|Kings]].

Some also include the western part of [[Hants County, Nova Scotia|Hants County]], including the towns of [[Hantsport, Nova Scotia|Hantsport]] and [[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]] even further to the east, but geographically speaking they are part of the [[Avon River (Nova Scotia)|Avon River]] valley.

The steep face of basaltic North Mountain shelters the valley from the adjacent Bay of Fundy and rises to almost 1000 feet in elevation in some parts.  The granitic South Mountain also rises to similar elevation and shelters the valley from the climate of the Atlantic Ocean approximately 100 kilometres further south on the province's [[South Shore (Nova Scotia)|South Shore]].

Within the valley itself are two &quot;major&quot; rivers, the [[Annapolis River]] which flows west from the Caribou Bog in the central part of the valley into the [[Annapolis Basin]], and the [[Cornwallis River]] which flows east from Caribou Bog into the [[Minas Basin]].

The resulting &quot;micro climate&quot; provides relatively mild temperatures for the region, and coupled with the fertile glacial sedimentary soils on the valley floor, the region is conducive to growing vegetable and fruit crops.  Particularly famous for its [[apple]] crop, the valley hosts in excess of 1,000 farms of various types, the majority being relatively small family-owned operations.

==History==

Long settled by the [[Mi'kmaq]] Nation, the valley experienced French settlement at the [[Habitation at Port-Royal]], near modern day Annapolis Royal in the western part of the valley, beginning in 1605 and continuing through to the British-ordered expulsion of [[Acadian|Acadians]] in [[1755]] and at [[Grand Pre, Nova Scotia|Grand Pré]] in the eastern part of the valley.  [[New England Planters]] moved in to occupy the abandoned Acadian farming areas and the region also saw subsequent settlement by [[United Empire Loyalists|Loyalist]] refugees of the [[American Revolutionary War]], as well as foreign Protestants.

==Economy==

Today, the valley is still largely dominated by agriculture but also has a growing diversity in its economies, partly aided by the importance of post-secondary education centres provided by [[Acadia University]] in Wolfville, and the [[Nova Scotia Community College]] campuses located in [[Kentville, Nova Scotia|Kentville]], [[Middleton, Nova Scotia|Middleton]], [[Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown]], and [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]].

[[Michelin]] has an important truck tire manufacturing plant in [[Waterville, Nova Scotia|Waterville]] and the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] has its largest [[Canadian Forces Air Command|air force]] base in [[Atlantic Canada]] located at [[CFB Greenwood]].

The valley is home to the annual [[Annapolis Valley Apple Blossom Festival|Apple Blossom Festival]], held in late spring.

==Communities==

Population centres in the valley from west to east include:

*[[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]]
*[[Cornwallis, Nova Scotia|Cornwallis]]
*[[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia|Annapolis Royal]]
*[[Bridgetown, Nova Scotia|Bridgetown]]

An '''analgesic''' (colloquially known as '''painkillers''') is any member of the diverse group of [[Medication|drug]]s used to relieve [[pain]] and to achieve '''analgesia'''. This derives from Greek ''an-'', &quot;without&quot;, and ''-algia'', &quot;pain&quot;. Analgesic drugs act in various ways on the [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] and [[central nervous system]]; they include [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), the [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) such as the [[salicylate]]s, [[narcotic]] drugs such as [[morphine]], synthetic drugs with narcotic properties such as [[tramadol]], and various others. Some other classes of drugs not normally considered analgesics are used to treat [[neuropathy|neuropathic]] pain syndromes; these include [[antidepressant|tricyclic antidepressants]] and [[anticonvulsant]]s.

==Stepwise use==
In [[1990]], the [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) approved an &quot;analgesic ladder&quot; which recommends the stepwise introduction of stronger painkillers if the more basic ones are ineffective. While originally introduced for managing pain in [[cancer]], these guidelines have found application in all fields of medicine, such as surgery and anaesthetics.
# The first step is [[paracetamol]] (500&amp;nbsp;mg to 1&amp;nbsp;g every 4&amp;ndash;6 hours).
# The second step involves the addition of an NSAID (e.g. [[ibuprofen]]) or a weak opioid (such as [[codeine]]).
# The third step comprises the addition of a strong opioid (such  as [[morphine]], [[oxycodone]] or a [[fentanyl]] preparation); if codeine is being taken the strong opioid replaces codeine.

==The major classes==
===Paracetamol and NSAIDs===
The exact mechanism of action of paracetamol is uncertain, but it appears to be acting centrally. [[Aspirin]] and the NSAIDs inhibit [[cyclooxygenase]], leading to a decrease in [[prostaglandin]] production; this improves pain and also [[inflammation]] (in contrast to paracetamol and the opioids).

Paracetamol has few side effects, but dosing is limited by possible [[hepatotoxicity]] (potential for [[liver]] damage). NSAIDs may predispose to [[peptic ulcer]]s, [[renal failure]], [[allergy|allergic reactions]], and [[hearing loss]]. They may also increase the risk of [[hemorrhage]].

===Opiates and morphinomimetics===
[[Tramadol]] and [[buprenorphine]] are thought to be [[partial agonist]]s of the [[opioid receptor]]s. [[Morphine]], the archetypical opioid, and various other substances (e.g. [[pethidine]], [[oxycodone]], [[hydrocodone]], [[diamorphine]]) all exert a similar influence on the cerebral opioid system. Dosing may be limited by opioid toxicity (confusion, [[myoclonus|myoclonic jerks]] and pinpoint pupils), but there is no dose ceiling in patients who tolerate this.

Opioids, while very effective analgesics, may have some unpleasant side-effects. Up to 1 in 3 patients starting morphine may experience [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] (generally relieved by a short course of [[antiemetic]]s). [[Pruritus]] (itching) may require switching to a different opioid. [[Constipation]] occurs in almost all patients on opioids, and [[laxative]]s ([[lactulose]], [[macrogol]]-containing or [[co-danthramer]]) are typically co-prescribed.

When used appropriately, opioids and similar [[narcotic]] analgesics are safe and effective, carrying relatively little risk of [[addiction]]. Occasionally, gradual tapering of the dose is required to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

===Specific agents===
In patients with chronic or neuropathic pain, various other substances may have analgesic properties. [[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s, especially [[amitriptyline]], have been shown to improve pain in what appears to be a central manner. The exact mechanism of [[carbamazepine]], [[gabapentin]] and [[pregabalin]] is similarly unclear, but these [[anticonvulsant]]s are used to treat neuropathic pain with modest success.

==Specific forms and uses==
===Combinations===
Analgesics are frequently used in combination, such as the paracetamol and [[codeine]] preparations found in many non-prescription pain relievers. They can also be found in combination with vasoconstrictor drugs such as [[pseudoephedrine]] for [[sinus]]-related preparations, or with [[antihistamine]] drugs for allergy sufferers.

===Topical or systemic===
Topical analgesia is generally recommended to avoid systemic side-effects. Painful joints, for example, may be treated with an [[ibuprofen]]- or [[diclofenac]]-containing gel; [[capsaicin]] also is used topically. [[Lidocaine]] and  [[glucocorticoid|steroids]] may be injected into painful joints for longer-term pain relief. [[Lidocaine]] is also used for painful [[mouth sore]]s and to numb areas for [[dentistry|dental]] work and minor medical procedures.

===Psychotropic agents===
[[Tetrahydrocannabinol]] and some other [[cannabinoids]], either from the ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' plant or synthetic, have analgesic properties, although the use of cannabis derivatives is illegal in many countries. Other analgesic agents include [[ketamine]] (an NMDA receptor antagonist), [[clonidine]] and other α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenoreceptor agonists, and [[mexiletine]] and other local anaesthetic analogues.

==Addiction==
In the [[United States]] in recent years, however, there has been a wave of new [[addiction]]s to prescription painkillers such as [[oxycodone]] (OxyContin, Percocet etc.) and [[hydrocodone]] (Vicodin, Lortab etc.).  The [[US Government|U.S. Government]] is now taking steps to reverse this epidemic, which it has blamed on easy access to prescription drugs over the [[Internet]].  The bigger problem however is doctors overprescribing these drugs.

'''Amphibious assault ships''', usually shortened to '''amphibs''', '''phibs''' or popularly known as '''gator freighters''', denotes a range of classes of [[warship]] employed to land and support ground forces on enemy territory by an [[amphibious assault]]. The largest fleet of these types is operated by the [[United States Navy]], including the [[Tarawa class amphibious assault ship|''Tarawa'' class]] dating back to the [[1970s]] and the newer and larger [[Wasp class amphibious assault ship|''Wasp'' class]] ships that debuted in [[1989]].  While grossly resembling [[aircraft carrier]]s, the role of an amphibious assault ship is fundamentally different:  its aviation facilities have the primary role of hosting helicopters to support forces ashore rather than to support strike aircraft.   

==History==
It is often said that amphibious assaults are the hardest of all military operations to coordinate. They need such fine control and such a large degree of coordination that it is only the top tier powers that have the ability to even attempt them seriously, let alone pull them off. The two nations that have made by far the most amphibious assaults during the past century are the United States and United Kingdom. From the great assaults of WWII to the recent attack on the [[Al-Faw Peninsula]] in [[Iraq]], both countries have been at the forefront of developing amphibious assault [[Military doctrine|doctrine]] and shipping. The UK maintains what many would call the second most powerful amphibious assault fleet in the world.

===World War I and interwar period===
The history of the specialist amphibious assault vessel really begins during [[World War II]]. Prior to [[World War I]], amphibious assaults had taken place using conventional boats. The disastrous Gallipoli landings of 1915 (see [[Battle of Gallipoli]]) showed that this type of operation was impossible in the face of modern weapons, especially the machine gun. The [[1920s]] and [[1930s]] did not see much progress in most of the world, the exception being the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]]. The small Corps operations of the period in central and south American lead to the development of amphibious assault doctrine much in advance of the rest of the world. By the late 1930s, concrete plans were beginning to form to build the first really specialised amphibious assault ships.

Specialised shipping can be divided into two types, most crudely described as ships and craft. In general the ships carry the troops from the port of embarkation to the drop point for the assault and the craft carry the troops from the ship to the shore. Amphibious assaults taking place over short distances can also involve the shore-to-shore technique where landing craft go directly from the port of embarkation to the assault point.

===World War II developments===
Many of the early types of shipping were converted cargo vessels. However, the [[Landing Ship Tank]] (LST) stands out. As the name suggests it is a specialised type for getting tanks or other large vehicles ashore. Unlike the other larger shipping, LSTs could beach and discharge directly onto shore. Beyond the ships carrying the troops, other vessels were needed. It was quickly appreciated that amphibious assaults were such complicated operations that a specialised flagship was needed, with facilities that a normal naval vessel simply could not provide. It was also realised that [[battleship]]s, [[cruiser (warship)|cruisers]] and [[destroyer]]s could not necessary provide all the [[fire support]] (including [[suppressive fire]]) that an assault would need. Therefore specialised shipping was developed that incorporated various direct and indirect fire weapons. These included guns and rockets which could be mounted on landing craft and landing ships. As part of the final barrage before an assault, the landing area would be plastered by these types.

Despite all the progress that was seen during WWII, there were still fundamental limitations in the types of coastline that were suitable for assault. Beaches had to be relatively free of obstacles, and have the right tidal conditions and the correct slope. However, the development of the helicopter changed the equation fundamentally.

==Developments in the 1950s, 1960s==
The first use of helicopters in an amphibious assault came during the [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-[[France|French]]-[[Israeli]] invasion of [[Egypt]] in 1956 (the [[Suez War]]). Two British light fleet carriers were pressed into service to carry helicopters, and a [[battalion]]-sized airborne assault was made. One of these [[HMS Bulwark (R08)|''Bulwark'']] was comissioned in the late 50s as a dedicated &quot;commando carrier&quot;. The techniques were developed further by [[United States|American]] forces in the [[Vietnam War]] and refined during training exercises. The modern amphibious assault can take place at virtually any point of the coast, making defending against them extremely difficult.

Earlier ships which played a similar role to the current vessels as the heart of an amphibious assault included five [[Iwo Jima class amphibious assault ship|''Iwo Jima'' class]] [[Landing Platform Helicopter]] vessels, built in the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]] and various converted fleet and escort carriers. The first of the type envisaged was the [[escort aircraft carrier]] [[USS Block Island (CVE-106)|USS ''Block Island'' (CVE-106/LPH-1)]], which never actually saw service as an amphibious assault ship. Delays in the construction of the ''Iwo Jima'' class saw other conversions made as a stopgap measure; three [[Essex class aircraft carrier|''Essex''-class aircraft carriers]] and one [[Casablanca class escort carrier|''Casablanca''-class escort carrier]] were converted into amphibs, the [[Boxer class amphibious assault ship|''Boxer'']] and [[Thetis Bay class amphibious assault ship|''Thetis Bay'' classes]].

The ''Tarawa'' and ''Wasp'' types and their ''Iwo Jima'' class forebears resemble [[aircraft carrier]]s. However, the role of an amphibious assault ship is fundamentally different to that of an aircraft carrier. Its aviation facilities are not to support strike or air defence aircraft, but for hosting helicopters to support forces ashore.

==Smaller ships==
Beyond the largest vessels in the fleet, a variety of other specialised types support amphibious assaults. These include the landing platform dock (LPD), landing ship dock (LSD) and command ships (LCC and AGF). Navies other than the USN operate still further types including the older [[tank landing ship|landing ship tank]] (LST), landing ship logistics (LSL) and landing ship medium (LSM).

==Recent innovations==
One of the most recent innovations is the [[LCAC]] or Landing Craft Air Cushioned. These large [[hovercraft]] further expand the range of conditions under which an amphibious assault can take place and increase the speed of transfer of assets from ship to shore.

==Wasp and Tarawa air complement==
The ''Wasp'' and ''Tarawa'' types do in fact carry a small number of [[AV-8 Harrier II|Harrier jump jet]] attack planes. They also have a secondary role as &quot;[[sea control ship]]s&quot;, carrying more Harriers, something that was first used in combat during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

    <title>Accusative case</title>
    <id>2251</id>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Table_Cases}}

The '''accusative case''' of a [[noun]] is the [[grammatical case]] used to mark the '''direct object''' of a [[verb]]. The same case is used in many languages for the objects of (some or all) [[preposition|prepositions]].

The accusative case exists (or existed once) in all the [[Indo-European languages]] (including [[Latin]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]]), in the [[Finno-Ugric languages]], and in [[Semitic languages]] (such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]]). It should be noted that [[Balto-Fennic languages]] such as Finnish and Estonian have two cases to mark objects, the accusative and the [[partitive case]]. In morphosyntactic alignment terms, both perform the accusative function, but the accusative object is [[Telicity|telic]], while the partitive is not.

Modern [[English language|English]], which lacks [[declension]] in its nouns, still has an explicitly marked accusative case in a few pronouns as a remnant of [[Old English language|Old English]], an earlier declined form of the language. &quot;Whom&quot; is the accusative case of &quot;who&quot;; &quot;him&quot; is the accusative case of &quot;he&quot; (the final &quot;m&quot; of both of these words can be traced back to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] accusative case suffix); and &quot;her&quot; is the accusative case of &quot;she&quot;. These words ''also'' serve as the [[dative case]] pronouns in English and could arguably be classified in the [[oblique case]] instead. Most modern English grammarians feel that due to the lack of declension except in a few pronouns, where accusative and dative have been merged, that making case distinctions in English is no longer relevant, and frequently employ the term &quot;[[Objective_(grammar)|objective case]]&quot; instead ''(see [[Declension in English]]).''

==Example==
In the sentence ''I see '''the car''''', the [[noun phrase]] ''the car'' is the direct object of the verb &quot;see&quot;. In English, which has mostly lost the case system, the definite article and noun &amp;mdash; &quot;the car&quot; &amp;mdash; remain in the same form regardless of the grammatical role played by the words. One can correctly use &quot;the car&quot; as the subject of a sentence also: &quot;The car is parked here.&quot;

In a declined language, the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the article and/or noun changes in some way according to the grammatical role played by the noun in a given sentence. For example, in [[German language|German]], one possible translation of &quot;the car&quot; is ''der Wagen''. This is the form in [[nominative case]], used for the subject of a sentence. If this article/noun pair is used as the object of a verb, it (usually) changes to the accusative case, which entails an article shift in German &amp;mdash; ''Ich sehe '''den Wagen'''.'' In German, masculine nouns change their definite article from ''der'' to ''den'' in accusative case. 

''See also [[Morphosyntactic alignment]].''

== The case in Latin ==
The Accusative case (''Accusativus'') can also mean direction (''domum'' - homewards, ''Romam'' - &quot;to Rome&quot; with no preposition needed), time duration (''multos annos'' - for many years, ''ducentos annos'' - for 200 years) and can be used with infinitive (''Accusativus cum infinitivo''), e.g. ''dico '''eum''' domi abesse'' - &quot;I say he isn't at home&quot;, ''suspecto '''eam''' hoc legisse'' - &quot;I suspect that she has read this&quot; or ''Romani antiqui putabant '''Martem''' bella regere'' - &quot;Ancient Romans thought that Mars directs the wars&quot;.

      <comment>/* Apostolicity as episcopal continuity */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Christianity]], the doctrine of '''Apostolic Succession''' (or the belief that the Church is 'apostolic') maintains that the Christian Church today is the spiritual successor of the Church of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostle]]s. Different Christian [[religious denomination|denominations]] interpret this doctrine in different ways.

While in many churches it is seen as the basis for [[bishop|episcopacy]] in general, the case of St. Peter's apostolic succession as head of the church is also the basis for the specific claim of universal primacy, notably in the Catholic papacy (where it implies supreme authority) and the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] tradition (where it is a more symbolic precedence, not unlike the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Patriarch of Constantinople]]).  In any event, all these communions recognize Apostolic succession as the determining factor of a particular group's legitimacy as a Christian church.

==Mainstream Christianity==
===Apostolicity as episcopal continuity===
The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] (including its Oriental and Eastern rites), [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]], Independent Anglican, [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]], and some [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Churches hold that apostolic succession is maintained through the consecration of their [[bishop]]s in unbroken personal [[historic episcopate|succession back to the apostles]] but these Churches do not necessarily interpret this &quot;succession&quot; identically. In Catholic and Orthodox theology, the unbrokenness of apostolic succession is significant because of Jesus Christ's promise that the &quot;gates of hell&quot; (Matthew 16:18) would not prevail against the Church, and his promise that he himself would be with the apostles to &quot;the end of the age&quot; ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28:20). According to this interpretation, a complete disruption or end of such apostolic succession would mean that these promises were not kept as would an apostolic succession which, while formally intact, completely abandoned the teachings of the Apostles and their immediate successors; as, for example, if all the bishops of the world agreed to abrogate the [[Nicene Creed]] or to repudiate the [[Bible]].

Both Orthodox and Catholics believe that each of their teachings today is the same as or is in essential harmony with the teaching of the first apostles, although each might deny this about the other, at least where the teachings of each are in conflict. This form of the doctrine was formulated by [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] in the second century, in response to certain [[gnosticism|Gnostics]]. These Gnostics claimed that Christ or the Apostles passed on some teachings secretly, or that there were some secret apostles, and that they (the Gnostics) were passing on these otherwise secret teachings. Irenaeus responded that the identity of the original Apostles was well known, as was the main content of their teaching and the identity of the apostles' successors. Therefore, anyone teaching something contrary to what was known to be apostolic teaching was not, in any sense, a successor to the Apostles or to Christ.

Catholics recognize the validity of the apostolic successions of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian, Old Catholic, and some Independent Catholic Churches (such recognition is not reciprocated by the Eastern Orthodox, who do not separate &quot;valid&quot; from &quot;licit&quot;). [[Pope Leo XIII]] clarified, in his [[1896]] [[Papal bull|bull]] that the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] church believes that the [[Anglican Church]]'s consecrations are invalid because of changes made to the rite of consecration under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], thus denying that Anglicans participate in the apostolic succession; the [[Church of Sweden]]'s apostolic succession is seen as having been maintained, and following the establishment of the [[Porvoo Communion]] an increasing number of Anglicans will also be able to trace their succession through Swedish bishops as well as [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]] bishops, whose [[holy orders]] are recognized as valid by Rome and who, at least those of the Union of Utrecht, are in full communion with [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] since the Bonn Agreement of 1931.  It should also be noted that since the issuance of &quot;[[Apostolicae Curae]]&quot;, many Anglican jurisdictions have revised their ordinals, bringing them more in line with ordinals emanating from the early Church.

In addition to a line of historic transmission, [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] churches additionally require that a hierarch maintain Orthodox Church doctrine, which they hold to be that of the Apostles, as well as communion with other Orthodox bishops. The [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] have permitted clergy ordained by Catholic and Anglican bishops to be rapidly ordained within Orthodoxy. However, this is a matter of [[Economy (Eastern Orthodoxy)|ekonomia]] and not recognition of Apostolic Succession, although in some cases, Catholic priests entering Eastern Orthodoxy have been received by &quot;vesting&quot; and have been allowed to function immediately within Orthodoxy as priests.

The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], which is one of the Oriental Orthodox churches, recognizes Catholic episcopal consecrations without qualification (and that recognition is reciprocated).

Some [[Protestant]] churches, such as Anglicans (including those known in the U.S. as Episcopalians), the [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of [[Latvia|Latvija]], do have Apostolic Succession (also known as the &quot;[[historic episcopate]]&quot;).  Bishops in the [[United Methodist Church]] do not claim to be within the historic episcopate.  Their succession derives from [[John Wesley]] who was  an ordained priest of the Church of England, but not himself a bishop and therefore had no power to consecrate others.  He justified his practice of ordaining &quot;elders&quot; (&quot;presbyters&quot;) for Methodism by appealing to a perceived need and by citing a minority opinion among the early Church Fathers (and possible ancient precedent from the Church of Alexandria) which held that presbyters (&quot;priests&quot; or &quot;elders&quot;) could, at least collectively, indeed ordain other such presbyters and even consecrate, or &quot;set apart&quot; bishops.

===Apostolicity as doctrinal continuity===

Most Protestant churches would deny that the apostolicity of the Church rests on an unbroken episcopacy.  They generally hold that one important qualification of the apostles was that they were chosen directly by [[Jesus]] and that they witnessed the resurrected Christ.  According to this understanding, the work of these twelve (and the Apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]), together with the prophets of the twelve tribes of Israel, provide the doctrinal foundation for the whole church of subsequent history through the Scriptures of the Bible. To share with the apostles the same faith, to believe their word as found in the Scriptures, to receive the same Holy Spirit, is the only sense in which apostolic succession is meaningful, because it is in this sense only that men have fellowship with God in the truth (an extension of the [[Reformation]] doctrines of ''[[sola fide]]'' and ''[[sola scriptura]]'').  The most meaningful ''apostolic succession'' for most Protestants, then, is the faithful succession of apostolic '''teaching'''.

It is worth noting, however, that some Protestant [[charismatic]] churches include &quot;apostles&quot; among the offices that should be evident into modern times in a true church, though they never trace an historical line of succession.

Those who hold to the importance of episcopal apostolic succession would counter the above by appealing to the [[New Testament]], which, they say, implies a personal apostolic succession (from [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] to [[Timothy]] and [[Apostle Titus|Titus]], for example) and which states that Jesus gave the Apostles a &quot;blank check&quot; to lead the Church as they saw fit under the guidance of the Holy Spirit ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 18:18 and [[Acts]] Chapter 15, for example).  They appeal as well to other documents of the very early Church, especially the Epistle of St. Clement to the Church at Corinth, written around 96 CE.  In it, [[Pope Clement I|Clement]] defends the authority and prerogatives of a group of &quot;[[elders]]&quot; or &quot;[[bishops]]&quot; in the Corinthian Church which had, apparently, been deposed and replaced by the congregation on its own initiative.  In this context, Clement explicitly states that the apostles both appointed bishops as successors and had directed that these bishops should in turn appoint their own successors; given this, such leaders of the Church were not to be removed without cause and not in this way.  Further, proponents of the necessity of the personal apostolic succession of bishops within the Church point to the universal practice of the undivided early Church (up to 431 CE), from which, as organizations, the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and the Assyrian Churches are all indisputably directly descended.

At the same time, no defender of the personal apostolic succession of bishops would deny the importance of doctrinal continuity in the Church.  As stated above, Ireneus explicitly ties the two together.

==Latter-day Saints (Mormons)==

The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) has a similar, but unique position.  Latter-day Saints believe that God directs his church at all times through [[Revelation#Latter_Day_Saint_concept_of_Revelation|revelation]] in response to prayer.  However, a person is entitled to revelation only for that [[Calling (Mormonism)|calling]] over which they have authority.  For example, anyone is entitled to revelation for concerning themselves, a head of household is entitled to revelation for their family, a bishop has the authority to receive revelation concerning the congregation over which they preside (e.g. Rome or Ephesus), though only ordained apostles had the authority from the Lord to receive revelation for doctrine for the entire church.  An excellent example of church-wide apostolic revelation is [http://scriptures.lds.org/acts/10 Acts 10:1-48] where Peter had prayed and received revelation from God that the gospel could now go forward to the Gentiles as well as the Jews.

Hence, Latter-day Saints have a different interpretation of the scripture where Christ says &quot;upon this rock I will build my church&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/matt/16 Matthew 16:13-18]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Christ asks his disciples who they think he is, Peter had the right answer because he prayed and received revelation: &quot;Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, ''but my Father which is in heaven.''&quot;  When Christ says upon this rock I will build my church&quot;, the rock of which he was speaking was ''revelation''.  As long as there were apostles with the authority from the Lord to receive revelation for the entire church, the church would continue to follow Christ.  Circumstances change and so must the church: at one time Christ said not to preach to the Gentiles, and later Peter was given revelation when it was time to start.[http://scriptures.lds.org/acts/10]  The need for constant ongoing revelation is critical to conduct the affairs of the church.

The LDS Church understands that Christ chose apostles and gave them the authority to receive revelation for the church by the laying on of hands.  As necessary, the apostles passed this authority to others by choosing and ordaining new apostles by the laying on of hands (such as Paul and Matthias).  Those individuals then had the appropriate authority to receive revelation for and officiate over the church in that office at that time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.&quot;&lt;br&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/acts/1 Acts 1:24-26]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, due to distance and persecution, the existing apostles were not able to meet frequently enough to choose and ordain new apostles, and eventually all of the apostles were killed, leaving nobody in the church with apostolic authority.  

At this point, for the church to continue properly, apostolic authority would have needed to be dispensed again from God, but this did not happen.  Instead, the bishops took over the leadership of the church, assuming authority that they did not possess - breaking the aspostolic succession.  An example of the resulting confusion is the [[First Council of Nicaea]] where [[Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine the Great]], a [[Solar deity|Sun god]] worshipper, presided over a meeting of bishops to determine church doctrine, instead of that doctrine being revealed by God to worthy apostles.  The LDS church refers to the resultant loss of revelation and falling away from the teachings of Jesus Christ as the [[Great Apostasy]].  Latter-day Saints believe that this was predicted when Amos said that there would be a &quot;famine of hearing the words of the Lord&quot; in [http://scriptures.lds.org/amos/8 Amos 8:11.]

The LDS Church maintains that the authority from God needed to be restored to the earth, which took place when God the Father and His son, Jesus Christ, [[First Vision|appeared]] to [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] near [[Palmyra, New York]] in [[1820]] and called Joseph as a prophet to restore Christ's church to the earth with correct doctrines and practices.  

Near the time that Joseph formally organized the church in [[1830]], the apostles Peter, James and John appeared to Joseph.  They laid hands on Joseph and restored to him the apostolic authority to govern the church.[http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/27/12#12]  Joseph was visited by other heavenly messengers at different times, each one conferring upon him the particular authority or keys for which they had stewardship.  John the Baptist restored the [[Aaronic Priesthood]], Peter James and John restored the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Mormonism)|Melchizedek Priesthood]], with other heavenly messengers such as Moses and Elijah restoring additional authority.  Joseph was given the authority like the apostles of old, to confer to others specific priesthood authority by the laying on of hands.  All of the various keys of this authority have been and are passed on to worthy, male members of the LDS Church according to their particular offices.  In this way, Latter-day Saints hold that apostolic authority was ''restored'' to the earth through the original twelve apostles and apostolic succession continues today through the ordination of new apostles as the older apostles pass away.

==Jehovah's Witnesses==
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] teach that apostolic succession is an erroneous doctrine. They base this teaching on the accounts of the replacement of Judas Iscariot and the death of the apostle James. In Acts Chapter 1, in the [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]], Peter says: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus, because he had been numbered among us and he obtained a share in this ministry... For it is written in the book of Psalms, &amp;#8216;Let his lodging place become desolate, and let there be no dweller in it,&amp;#8217; and, &amp;#8216;His office of oversight let someone else take.&amp;#8217;&quot; ''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]]''&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

They contrast this with the fact that Acts does not mention any successor being named for the ''faithful'' apostle James. (Acts 12:2; ''[[Insight on the Scriptures]]'' pg. 129 Vol. I)

      <text xml:space="preserve">:'' For other uses of Adam or Eve, see [[Adam (disambiguation)]] and [[Eve (disambiguation)]]. For the orchid species commonly called Adam and Eve, see [[Aplectrum hyemale]].''

According to the [[Book of Genesis]] in [[Judaism]]'s [[Torah]] and the [[Christian]] [[Bible]], and [[Islam]]'s [[Qur'an]], '''Adam'''  was the [[First man or woman|first man]] created by [[God]]. At Genesis 1:27, Adam's female [[Marriage|mate]] is said to have been created with Adam, and at Genesis 2:21-22 Adam's wife is named as '''[[Eve]]''' (or '''Chava-חוה''') and was created from his side. Hence, in modern times Eve has been thought of as the [[first woman]], though classical traditions recorded in the Midrash make her the second.

The Qur'an tells the story of Adam and Eve mainly in [[al-Baqara|2]]:30-39, [[al-A'raf|7]]:11-25, [[al-Hijr|15]]:26-44, [[al-Isra|17]]:61-65, [[Ta-Ha|20]]:115-124, [[Sad (sura)|38]]:71-85., and the Book of Genesis tells the story at chapters 2-3.  Also, in the Scriptures of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the story of Adam and Eve is explained in better detail in the Book of Mormon in the Second Chapter of 2nd Nephi, and in Chapters  2-5 in the Book of Moses and Chapters 3 through 4 in the Book of Abraham.  The latter two is found in the Pearl of Great Price.

==Interpretation of names==
{{Cleanup-date|January 2006}}
'''Adam'''&amp;mdash;אָדָם in [[Standard Hebrew]], ʾĀḏām in [[Tiberian Hebrew]], آدم (ʾĀdam) in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], አዳም ('Adam) in [[Geez]] (Ethiopic), and Adamus in [[Latin]] &amp;mdash; translates literally as ''red earth''. In the ancient cultures of the [[fertile crescent]], people were thought to have been created from the earth itself, and so the term ''red earth'' was used to refer to mankind generally. This is true today for the [[Kazak]] language, in which ''Adam'' means ''human'' and ''Adamshylyk'' is mankind, and for most other [[Turkic languages]], in which ''Adam'' also means ''man'' or ''human''.

However, in the [[Sibylline Oracles]], the name Adam is explained as a [[notaricon]] composed of the initials of the four directions; [[anatole]] (east), [[dusis]] (west), [[arktos]] (north), and [[mesembria]] (south). The Jews had their own [[acrostic]] interpretation of the name Adam. In the [[2nd century CE]], [[Rabbi Yohanan]] used the Greek technique of notarichon to explain the name אָדָם as the initials of the words ''afer'', ''dam'', and ''marah'', being dust, blood, and [[gall]].

'''Eve'''&amp;mdash;חַוָּה (Ḥavva) in [[Standard Hebrew]], Ḥawwāh in [[Tiberian Hebrew]], حواء (Hawwāʾ) in Arabic, ሕይዋን (Hiywan) in Geez, and Eva/Eua or Geva in Latin &amp;mdash; means simply ''living one'', or ''[[life]]''. Hence these names are literal descriptions of the purported parents of humanity.

==Adam and Eve of the Torah, Pseudepigraphic Books and other Jewish Traditions==

[[Image:AdamAndEve fx.png|200px|thumb|left|Traditional woodblock print portraying Adam and Eve in the [[Garden of Eden]] with many of the &quot;lower creatures.&quot;]]
[[Image:Michelangelo Buonarroti 017.jpg|thumb|left|Michelangelo's [[Creation of Adam|Adam]].]]

Adam is said, in the Torah, to have been created from the dust of the earth, and in the [[Talmud]] (Tractate Sanhedrin 38b) is, more specifically, described as having initially been a [[golem]] kneaded together from [[mud]].  In the Torah, God is initially described, at Genesis 1:26, as breathing the ''breath of life'' into the nostrils of the first man, and this is usually interpreted in Judaeo-Christian circles as having brought life immediately to the first man.

===Eve's creation===
At this point, in the Torah, [[Yahweh]] is described as causing a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and removing part of his body, usually interpreted as a [[rib cage|rib]] (though a more literal translation is non-specific), referring to &quot;side&quot;. From this body part, Eve is subsequently created, as a companion to alleviate Adam's loneliness.

===Traditions regarding Adam and other wives===
[[Image:Lilith (John Collier painting).jpg|thumb|''Lilith'' (1892), by [[John Collier]]]]

Thus in Genesis, there are two separate accounts of the creation &amp;mdash; one at Genesis 1-2:3, when woman was created with man and another after Genesis 2:4 giving the account of the creation of Eve from Adam's rib.  While the more traditional view holds these to be written by the same author as a fuller account supplementing the earlier one, most modern scholars support the [[documentary hypothesis]], which claims each account derived from separate source texts that were later combined, with Eve's name and story being present only in the [[Yahwist]] text. Even in ancient times, the presence of two distinct accounts was noted, and regarded with some curiosity. The first account says ''male and female [God] created them'', which has been assumed by critical scholars to imply simultaneous creation, whereas the second account states that God created Eve from Adam's rib because Adam was lonely. Thus to resolve this apparent discrepancy, mediaeval rabbis suggested that Eve and the woman of the first account were two separate individuals.

Preserved in the [[Midrash]], and the mediaeval [[Alphabet of Ben Sira]], this rabbinic tradition held that the first woman refused to take the submissive position to Adam in [[sexual intercourse|sex]], and eventually fled from him, consequently leaving him lonely. This first woman was identified in the Midrash as [[Lilith]], a figure elsewhere described as a night demon. 

The word ''liyliyth'' can also mean &quot;screech owl&quot;, as it is translated in the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Version]] of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 34:14, although some scholars take this to be a reference to the same demonic entity as mentioned in the Talmud. 

In the Talmud, Adam is said to have separated from Eve for 130 years, during which time his [[ejaculation]]s gave rise to ''ghouls, and demons''. Elsewhere in the Talmud, Lilith is identified as the mother of these creatures. The demons were said to prey on newborn males before they had been [[circumcised]], and so a tradition arose in which a protective amulet was placed around the neck of newborns. Traditions in the Midrash concerning Lilith, and her sexual appetite, have been compared to [[Sumerian mythology]] concerning the demon ''ki-sikil-lil-la-ke'', by scholars who postulate an intermediate [[Akkadian]] [[folk etymology]] interpreting the ''lil-la-ke'' portion of the name as a corruption of ''lîlîtu'', literally meaning ''female night demon''.

The ''Alphabet of Ben Sira'' Midrash goes even further and identifies a third wife, created after Lilith deserted Adam, but before Eve. This unnamed wife was purportedly made in the same way as Adam, from the &quot;dust of the earth&quot;, but the sight of her being created proved too much for Adam to take and he refused to go near her. It is also said that she was created from nothing at all, and that God created into being a skeleton, then organs, and then flesh. The Midrash tells that Adam saw her as &quot;full of blood and secretions,&quot; suggesting that he may have actually witnessed her creation and was horrified at seeing a body from the inside out. Ben Sira does not record this wife's fate. She was never named, and it assumed that she was allowed to leave the Garden a perpetual virgin, or was ultimately destroyed by God in favor of Eve, who was created when Adam was asleep and oblivous.  It should be noted here, that both Lilith and the Second Wife are free from any curse of the Tree of Knowledge, as they left long before the event occurred.

===The Fall of Man===
{{Main|Fall (religion)}}

[[Image:Domenichinoadam eve.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Domenichino]]'s portrayal of Genesis 3:12: &quot;The woman whom thou gavest [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat&quot; (1623&amp;ndash;1625).]]

The main story concerning Adam is traditionally regarded as extremely important in the major &quot;[[Abrahamic religions]]&quot;. This recounts how Adam and Eve are placed in the [[Garden of Eden]], and are allowed to cultivate and enjoy its fruit, living innocently. However, there was one tree they were explicitly forbidden from touching - the [[Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil]] - a tree otherwise unidentified, but it has been interpreted as a [[fig]], [[apple]], or [[pomegranate]] tree, or even a [[grape]] (see [[#Cultural influence]]). The Torah then records that a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], a creature described as having legs at that point, approached Eve and cajoled her into eating the [[forbidden fruit]], saying ''you won't die''. Later, Adam also ate.

They both became disturbed by their nudity, making aprons of [[fig]] leaves to cover themselves. The Torah goes on to state that God personally questioned them about this, and on discovering they had disobeyed, expelled them from Eden &amp; did not allow them to access the [[tree of life]], which grants immortality, and cursed the serpent to lose its legs so that it has to crawl, and to have mutual hatred for mankind.

===East of Eden===

The Torah states that Adam was expelled to the East, and that at the eastern entrance of the garden, God placed ''[[Cherubim]]'' and a flaming sword &quot;which turned every way&quot;. 

Genesis does not tell for how long Adam and Eve were in the [[Garden of Eden]], but the [[Book of Jubilees]] states that they were removed from the garden on the new moon of the fourth month of the 8th year after creation (Jubilees 3:33); other Jewish sources assert that it was less than a day. Shortly after their expulsion, Eve brought forth her first-born child, and thereafter their second &amp;mdash; [[Cain and Abel]], respectively. 

[[Image:Durer Adam and Eve.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''Adam and Eve'', by [[Albrecht Dürer]] ([[1507]]).]]

Only three of Adam's children (Cain, Abel, and Seth) are explicitly named in Genesis, although it does state that there were other sons and daughters as well (Genesis 5:4).

In [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]], two daughters are named - Azûrâ being the first, and Awân, who was born after Seth, Cain, Abel, nine other sons, and Azûrâ. Jubilees goes on to state that Cain later married Awân and Seth married Azûrâ, thus, despite the [[incest]], accounting for their descendants. However, according to ''[[Genesis Rabba]]'' and other later sources, either Cain had a twin sister, and Abel had two twin sisters, or Cain had a twin sister named Lebuda, and Abel a twin sister named Qelimath. In the [[Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan]], Cain's twin sister is named Luluwa, and Abel's twin sister is named Aklia.

Other [[pseudepigrapha]] give further details of their life outside of Eden, in particular, the [[Life of Adam and Eve]] (also known as the ''Apocalypse of Moses'') consisting entirely of a description of their life outside Eden. As the first man, Adam was traditionally a significant figure to whom was attributed prophecy and wisdom. 

After Cain killed Abel, and was cursed to wander, Adam and Eve conceived a third child named Seth, who, with Cain, gave rise to the two family lines of the [[Generations of Adam]]. 
According to the Bible, Adam finally died at the age of 930 years, the traditional Jewish view being that he and Eve are currently buried in the [[Cave of Machpelah]], in [[Hebron]].

==Separate Adam and Eve Traditions in Christianity==

Some branches of Christianity fully accept the tradition of Adam and Eve as portrayed in the Torah, and although some hold various views expressed in the Pseudepigrapha, they do not accept the later Jewish ''Midrash''.  For example, the serpent is generally equated with Satan, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah.  

The early Christian movement showed a toleration of women, although in the 2nd century, such Church Fathers as [[Tertullian]] held Eve especially responsible for the expulsion from Paradise.  In &quot;Memory of the Introduction of Sin into the World Through a Woman&quot;, he wrote:

:''&quot;If there dwelt upon earth a faith as great as is the reward of faith which is expected in the heavens, no one of you at all, best beloved sisters, from the time that she had first &quot;known the Lord,&quot; and learned (the truth) concerning her own (that is, woman's) condition, would have desired too gladsome (not to say too ostentatious) a style of dress; so as not rather to go about in humble garb, and rather to affect meanness of appearance, walking about as Eve mourning and repentant, in order that by every garb of penitence she might the more fully expiate that which she derives from Eve,-the ignominy, I mean, of the first sin, and the odium (attaching to her as the cause) of human perdition. &quot;In pains and in anxieties dost thou bear (children), woman; and toward thine husband (is) thy inclination, and he lords It over thee.&quot; And do you not know that you are (each) an Eve? The sentence of God on this sex of yours lives in this age: the guilt must of necessity live too. You are the devil's gateway: you are the unsealer of that (forbidden) tree: you are the first deserter of the divine law: you are she who persuaded6 him whom the devil was not valiant enough to attack. You destroyed so easily God's image, man. On account of your desert-that is, death-even the Son of God had to die.&quot;''

The [[Dominicans]] Kramer and Sprengler used similar tracts to justify the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (&quot;Hammer of the Witches&quot;) published in [[1486]], that led to three centuries of persecution of &quot;witches&quot;.  

With the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the garden, [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition holds that the sword preventing anyone from entering [[Paradise]] again was removed once [[Jesus]] was born, in order to allow [[humanity]] to return to Paradise.

==Adam and Eve in Gnostic and Manichaean Traditions==
{{Main|Gnostics}}

===The Role of Androgynic Adam===

While the [[Gnostic]]s used scriptural texts as teaching devices, rather than viewing them to be literal accounts genuinely written by early patriarchs, this was the converse of what was true of what became official Christianity. The [[Gnostic]]'s [[Nag Hamadi]] text &quot;[[Apocalypse of Adam]]&quot;, for instance contains the account of the enlightenment Adam received, for which certain angels became jealous. The &quot;[[Testament of Adam]]&quot;, for example takes a further step to produce a faked ancient prophecy, of events that had supposedly already occurred by the time it was published.

In certain forms of Christian [[Gnosticism]] the creation of Adam as Protanthropos - the original man, had a very important place.  The [[Apocalypse of Adam]] suggests that Adam and Eve were originally conjoined in a single androgynous being both male and female and greater than the eternal angels and higher than Samael, the God of the Aeon and Powers that had created them.  This seems to be what Irenaeus (I, xxix, 3) refers to when he states that the Aeon Autogenes (self-created Aeon) creates a true and perfect human Anthrôpos, also called Adamas, who has &quot;Perfect Knowledge.  In wrath of Samael, the God of the Aeon then separated Adam from Eve, causing their superior knowledge of God to flee from them.

The Perfection of the Protanthropos is also sometimes seen as a result of a non material emanation from God, called the Son of God and seen as the prefigurement for the appearance of [[Jesus]], who, even in Conventional Christian literature is often referred to as &quot;The Second Adam&quot;.  According to the Naassenes it is only when Adam and Eve are separated that they &quot;sink&quot; into material form.  The Genesis verse, that &quot;according to the image of God he made them, male and female he made them&quot;, implied that the first account of the creation of man and woman, according to Theodotus (c.160 CE), that both man and God were anthropogynous beings, later separated by God, the Father/Mother.  As [[Elaine Pagels|Pagels]] shows &quot;The followers of Valentinus suggested that the Mother herself had encouraged the God of Israel to think he was acting autonomously, but as they explain, &quot;It was because he was foolish and ignorant of his Mother that he said, 'I am (the only) God; there is noone beside me'&quot;&quot;. (p.69)  In the Secret Book of John, the creator of Adam and Eve, when he said 

:&quot;'I am a jealous God and there is no other God besides me.' But by announcing this he indicated to the angels ... that another God does exist; for if there were no other one, of whom would he be jealous?... Then the Mother began to be distressed.&quot;

===The Role of Eve as the opener of Adam's Eyes===

Eve too has different roles within Gnosticism.  For example she is often seen as the embodiment of the supreme feminine principle, called barbelo, barbeloth, or barthenos.  As such she is equated with the Light-Maiden of Sophia (Wisdom), creator of the word (Logos) of God, the &quot;thygater tou photos&quot; or simply the Virgin Maiden, &quot;parthenos&quot;.  Again, in conventional Christianity, this is a prefigurement of Mary, also sometimes called &quot;the Second Eve&quot;.  In other Gnostic texts, such as The Hypostasis of the Archons, (The Reality of the Rulers), the Pistis Sophia is equated with Eve's daughter, Norea, the wife of Seth.

As a result of such Gnostic beliefs, especially amongst [[Marcionites]], women were considered equal to men, being revered as prophets, teachers, travelling evangelists, faith healers, priests and even bishops.

{{Main|Manichaeans}}

This is taken up in [[Manichaean]] belief the Protanthropos is seen as &quot;the World Soul&quot;, ([[Anima Mundi]]), sent to fight against darkness.  The &quot;Fall&quot; is then seen as the primordial man being delivered up to evil and swallowed in darkness, with the Universe as a whole now existing as a means of delivering the primordial Adam from Darkness.  Here too the intercourse between Adam and Eve was seen as the way in which darkness overcame the light. 

:&quot;Mani said, 'Then Jesus came and spoke to the one who had been born, who was Adam, and explained to him (about) the gardens (of Paradise), the deities, Gehenna, the satans, earth, heaven, sun, and moon. He also made him fear Eve, showing him how to suppress (desire) for her, and he forbade him to approach her, and made him fear to be near her, so that he did (what Jesus commanded). Then that (male) archon came back to his daughter, who was Eve, and lustfully had intercourse with her. He engendered with her a son, deformed in shape and possessing a red complexion, and his name was Cain, the Red Man. Then that son had intercourse with his mother, and engendered with her a son of white complexion, whose name was Abel, the White Man. Then Cain again had intercourse with his mother, and engendered with her two girls, one of whom was named Hakimat al-Dahr and the other Ibnat al-Hirê . Then Cain took Ibnat al-Hirê as his wife and presented Hakimat al-Dahr to Abel, and he took her as his wife.'&quot; [[http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jcreeves/manichaean_version_of_genesis_2-4.htm]]

===Role of Satan===

Gnostics seem to have taken the Marcionite belief that the Wrathful Yahweh of the Torah and the loving Father of Christianity were two separate divinities.  In their book &quot;The Origin of the World&quot; for instance it states:-

:The heaven and his earth were destroyed by the troublemaker that was below them all. And the six heavens shook violently; for the forces of chaos knew who it was that had destroyed the heaven that was below them. And when Pistis (Faith) knew about the breakage resulting from the disturbance, she sent forth her breath and bound him and cast him down into Tartaros. Since that day, the heaven, along with its earth, has consolidated itself through Sophia (Wisdom) the daughter of Yaldabaoth, she who is below them all. 

:Now when the heavens had consolidated themselves along with their forces and all their administration, the prime parent became insolent. And he was honored by all the army of angels. And all the gods and their angels gave blessing and honor to him. And for his part, he was delighted and continually boasted, saying to them, &quot;I have no need of anyone.&quot; He said, &quot;It is I who am God, and there is no other one that exists apart from me.&quot; And when he said this, he sinned against all the immortal beings who give answer. And they laid it to his charge. 

:Then when Pistis saw the impiety of the chief ruler, she was filled with anger. She was invisible. She said, &quot;You are mistaken, Samael,&quot; (that is, &quot;blind god&quot;). &quot;There is an immortal man of light who has been in existence before you, and who will appear among your modelled forms; he will trample you to scorn, just as potter's clay is pounded. And you will descend to your mother, the abyss, along with those that belong to you. 

[[Gnostic]] accounts also turned the identification of the serpent with Satan on its head, and the serpent was seen as the hero, particularly to [[Ophite]]s, who was trying to help the couple gain knowledge to defeat evil Samael, whom the Gnostics saw as the jealous [[demiurge]] of the creation. 

There is also the tradition that Satan refused to bow to Adam as a result of his exclusive love of God, and felt that bowing to humankind was a form of idolatry.  This tradition informs the treatment of Satan in some forms of Christian [[gnosticism]].

More extended versions of the fall of Satan exist in which he leads a divine war, which, while in works such as the Book of Enoch is recorded as being in heaven after Satan turns away from God.

==Adam and Eve in Islamic Tradition==

The important early Islamic commentator [[Tabari]] adds a number of details to the Torah, based on claimed [[hadith]] as well as specific Jewish traditions (so-called ''[[isra'iliyyat]]''). Tabari records that when it came time to create Adam, God sent [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]] (Jibril), then [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] (Mika'il), to fetch clay from the earth; but the earth complained, saying ''I take refuge in God from you, if you have come to diminish or deform me'', so the angels returned empty-handed. Tabari goes on to state that God responded by sending the [[Angel of Death]], who took clay from all regions, hence providing an explanation for the variety of appearances of the different races of mankind.

Aaccording to Tabari's account, after receiving the breath of God, Adam remained a dry body for 40 days, then gradually came to life from the head downwards, sneezing when he had finished coming to life, saying ''All praise be to God, the Lord of all beings''. Having been created, Adam, the first man, is described as having been given dominion over all the lower creatures, which he proceeds to name. As one of the people to whom God is said to have spoken to directly, Adam is seen as a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet in Islam]].

===The fall of Satan===

At this point, Adam takes a prominent role in Islamic traditions concerning the fall of [[Satan]], which is not recorded in the Torah, or in Christianity though is present in the historically important [[Book of Enoch]]. In these, when God announces his intention of creating Adam, some of the angels express dismay, asking why he would create a being that would do evil. Teaching Adam ''the names'' reassures the angels as to Adam's abilities, though commentators dispute which particular names were involved; various theories say they were the names of all things animate and inanimate, the names of the angels, the names of his own descendants, or the [[99 Names of God|names of God]].

When God orders the angels to bow to Adam one of those present, Satan ([[Iblis]] in Islam, regarded as a [[jinn]] rather than an angel, and hence avoiding questions about angels having [[free will]]), refuses due to his pride, and is summarily banished from the heavens. [[Liberal movements within Islam]] have viewed God's commanding the angels to bow before Adam as an exaltation of humanity, and as a means of supporting [[human rights]].  

More extended versions of the fall of Satan also exist in works such as that of Tabari, and the [[Shia]] commentator al-[[Qummi]], is explained where he is sent against the jinn, who had angered God by sin and fighting. In such versions where Satan leads the battle on God's behalf, rather than his own, it is the pride and conceit resulting from his victory which results in his expulsion, since pride is here seen as a sin. Islamic traditions further record that, in vengeful anger, Iblis promises God that he will lead as many humans astray as he can, to which God replies that it is the choice of humans - those who desire to will follow Satan, while those who desire to will follow God.

===The Creation of Eve in Islam===

Eve, is not mentioned by name in the Qur'an, she is nevertheless referred to as Adam's spouse, and Islamic tradition refers to her by an etymologically similar name - Hawwa. In fact, although her creation is not recounted in the Qur'an, Tabari recounts the biblical tale of her creation, stating that she was named because she was created from a ''living'' thing (her name means ''living''). The torah gives an etymology for ''woman'', or rather the Hebrew equivalent (''ish-shah''), stating that she should be called ''woman'' since she was taken out of man (''ish'' in Hebrew). The etymology is regarded as implausible by most semitic linguists.

Al-[[Qummi]] records the opinion that Eden was not entirely earthly, and so, having been sent to earth, Adam and Eve first arrived at mountain peaks outside [[Mecca]]; Adam on [[Safa]], and Eve on [[Marwa]]. In this Islamic tradition, Adam remained weeping for 40 days, until he repented, at which point God rewarded him by sending down the [[Kaaba]], and teaching him the [[hajj]]. Other Islamic traditions hold that Adam was moved to [[Sri Lanka]], as the next best thing to Eden, and, viewing Adam as having been a giant, human size having shrunk drastically before the [[great flood]], [[Adam's Peak]] is said to contain his giant footprint.

The Qur'an also describes the two sons of Adam (named Qabil and Habil in Islamic tradition, but not mentioned by name in the Qur'an) that correspond to Cain and Abel.

==Historicity==  
Many Jewish scholars in the ancient world and today and some modern Christians consider Adam and Eve as an example of [[The Bible as myth|religous myth]] where the focus is on fundamental truths.  In their interpretation, the story conveys the truth of sin and human rebellion, regardless of historical accuracy. All, some, or none of the actual events of the narrative may have actually happened.

Adam and Eve are usually considered as real historical people as [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%205.3&amp;version=31 Genesis 5:4] records Adam in a geneaology. In the [[New Testament]], [[Paul]] references Adam and Eve many times, especially contrasting Adam with Jesus where Paul writes &quot;just as sin entered the world through one man.&quot; This seems to support a historical Adam as many theologians interpret [[Original sin|Adam's sin]] as a historical event that changed humankind.  However, Paul could be merely using the myth as a teaching method. Others view Adam and Eve as metaphorical for every person when they first sin and God seeks them out. Those who hold this view point out that ''adam'' can also be translated ''humankind.''

[[The Age of Reason]] prompted Christians to interpret the Bible as strict history rather than historical [[Mythology|myth]]; [[William Whiston]] was one such early scholar.  [[James Ussher]] calculated Adam and Eve's life at approximately 6,000 BCE, basing on the [[Genealogies of Genesis]] and [[Table of Nations]].  

In [[Modern Age|modern times]], with the advent of [[archaeology|archaeological]] discoveries, the theory of [[evolution]], and [[genetics|genetic science]], Christians believing in the historicity of Adam and Eve were challenged. Many denominations have rejected the historicity of Adam and Eve; others have retained it, including the [[Roman Catholic Church]][http://www.catholic.com/library/Adam_Eve_and_Evolution.asp] and [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]]. Several controversal organizations have formed that view the Bible as strict history and try to backup their beliefs through science.

===Ancestry and evolutionary biology===
{{main|Mitochondrial Eve}}
A theory of a single male and female human ancestor is almost completely contradictory to most modern synthesis of the theory of [[evolution]], which posits that humans evolved from ape-like creatures, gradually. Nevertheless, modern [[genetics|genetic]] studies has identified a single female, [[Mitochondrial Eve]], as the ancestor of every human. Similarly, a single male ancestor has been identified, [[Y-chromosomal Adam]], living many millennia after Mitochondrial Eve.

===The Sumerian connection===
[[Image:Blake Adam and Eve.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''Adam and Eve'', by [[English poetry|English poet]] and [[Painting|painter]] [[William Blake]] ([[1808]]).]]

Tales involving [[Enki]] (from En = Lord, Ki = Earth) and [[Ninhursag]] in [[Sumerian mythology]] (from Nin = Lady, (K)hur = Mountain, Sag = Sacred), and [[Adapa]] in later mythology, has been put forward by several scholars as a likely candidate for large parts of the story of Adam and Eve, most controversially by [[David Rohl]] in 2005, but also by established scholars of Sumeria such as [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], in 1981. In the Sumerian myth, Ninhursag creates at [[Dilmun]] a beautiful garden full of lush vegetation and fruit trees called ''Edinu'' (Sumerian = Wilderness), a name remarkably similar to ''Eden''. Ninhursag creates the garden for herself, but fearing for its protection while she is absent, charges Enki, her lover, with the responsibility to control wild animals, and tend the garden.

Enki, however, becomes curious, and desires to know about the plants. His assistant Adapa, selects seven plants (Akkadian &quot;Shappatu&quot;, hence Hebrew &quot;Sabbath&quot;) offering them to Enki, who eats them. In other versions of the same story, he seduces seven generations of the offspring of his [[hieros gamos|divine marriage]] with Ninhursag, in turn. This enranges Ninhursag, and she causes Enki to fall ill. Enki becomes increasingly ill, feeling pain in seven parts of his body, the eighth part of which is his rib (Sumerian = Ti, meaning &quot;Life&quot;). The other gods realise he is dying and so persuade Ninhursag to relent. In response Ninhursag creates a new goddess named Ninti (Nin = Lady, Ti = Life/Rib), a name which translates both as ''Lady of Living'' and ''Lady of the Rib'', to cure the sickness.

One of Ninhursag's other names was Nintu, and most scholars hence view the story of Ninti as deriving from a pun on her name, arising after ''Nintu'' became corrupted to ''Ninti''. Ninhursag has the epithet ''mother of all living offspring'', and hence holds the same position as Eve - ''mother of all living'' (Genesis 3:29). Another significant connection is in the name of Ninti, as Eve's name means ''living'', and Eve is produced from Adam's rib. If one story were derived from the other, because the [[pun]] with rib is present only in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], linguistic criticism places the Sumerian as the more original account.

Enki himself was both the divine lover of Ninhursag, who brought fertility to the earth, and both he and Ninhursag were the 6th generation of the Gods (called by the Sumerians, the Anunaki from Anu = Heaven, Na = And, Ki = Earth), hence having parallels with Adam in addition to the story of the rib, and his charge over the garden. Mankind was created in the 7th generation in order that the younger Igigi Gods could rest from their labours and is additionally described as being fashioned from clay in Sumerian myth, though by the Babylonian era, the clay was said to have had the added blood of [[Kingu]], who was captured by [[Marduk]] son of Enki and Ninhursag, and slain. This supernatural importance of blood is not present in early Sumerian myth, but is recorded in certain sections of the torah, for example [[Leviticus]] records that ''the life is in the blood''. While the Sumerian/Babylonian myth involves multiple deities in the creation of man, in the [[monotheism|monotheist]] account in the torah, this is not possible.

Knowledge generally was viewed in Sumerian myth as deriving from trees. This is explicitly present in a myth of [[Inanna]] and [[Utu]], explaining how Inanna, goddess of [[lust]], initially gained knowledge about [[sexual intercourse|sex]] by descending to earth and eating from various plants and trees, in particular [[Cedar]]s. The merging of this motif, with that of forbidden fruit in the story of Enki and Ninhursag, to produce that of genesis, the [[Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil]], has been suggested by scholars of ancient near eastern mythology, such as Leick&lt;!-- Assyriology PhD (Univ. Graz - Austria), lecturer at Richmond College and Univ. Glamorgan --&gt;.

By the Babylonian era, Enki had become viewed as more removed from humanity, and his place as the first leader of man was taken by an individual named Adapa U-an (the [[Oannes]] of [[Berossus]]), who was a human, but created by Enki as advisor (Apkallu, Akkadian for the Sumerian Abgallu, from Ab = Water, Gal = Great, Lu = Man) to the first king of Enki's city of [[Eridu]]. One 14th century BC tablet in fact refers to Adapa as ''the seed of humankind''. One myth recounts that Adapa broke the wings of the south wind of the desert (Sumerian [[Ninlil]], from Nin = Lady, Lil = Wind, wife of the King of the Gods, [[Enlil]], in Akkadian times called Lilitu) in anger at being disturbed fishing, and so was called to the heavens to answer for doing so. Once there, he was warned by Enki to apologise for his actions, but not to touch the food, in case it had been poisoned in revenge.  But the Gods, impressed by his repentence set the ''food and drink of immortality'' before him, but heeding Enki's warning, he refused the food and so lost out on immortality. The god which offered the ''food and drink of immortality'' was the wily serpent-god [[Ningishzida]] (Hebrew [[Nehushtan]]). While in the biblical account it is knowledge which the serpent offers, what the serpent actually remarks to Eve is that she ''shall not die''. The food and drink of the gods originated from the earth, and hence somewhere lay the source of the food and drink of immortality, a ''Tree of Life''.

Nevertheless, in the biblical account, the food is consumed, not rejected, and the couple are punished for it by being expelled from the garden. Thus any derivation of the biblical account from Sumerian and Babylonian ones involves the confusion of the tale of Adapa and the south wind and that of Enki in the garden. Such a conflation of these two separate tales may have been influenced by a story preserved in the prologue of ''[[Gilgamesh]], [[Enkidu]] and the Underworld''. In this, Inanna, transplants the ''huluppu'' tree from the [[Euphrates]] to her own garden, but a wicked serpent made its nest amongst the roots of the tree, the Anzu bird had nested in the Branches and [[Lilith|Lilitu]] had taken residence in the trunk, and could not be charmed out. This tale connects the serpent to the garden, as well as, due to the presence of Inanna, goddess of love, holding knowledge coming from trees, and the theme of lust. Removing the part about Enki's rib from the story, and moving it to the start, would have allowed the failure to gain immortality being seen as punishment for eating the fruit, rather than a failure to obtain a gift.

Another confusing point is that translation &quot;rib&quot; from the Hebrew text is inaccurate. It was not interpreted as &quot;rib&quot; until after the [[Septuagint]] in the first, second, or third centuries B.C.E. 

:The Hebrew word translated 'rib'. . . occurs forty-two times in the O. T., and in this instance alone is it translated 'rib.' In the majority of cases it is translated 'side' or 'sides,' in other places 'corners' or, 'chambers,' but never 'rib' or 'ribs.' [http://godswordtowomen.org/resources/onlinebooks/lessons%201-10.htm][http://www.jasher.com/Adamsrib.htm]

===[[Vedic]] (Hindu) Connection===
A [[Vedic]] story told in Mundakopanisad (Vedic text from about 1000BC) refers to two birds perched on a Pippala (Ficus religiosa) tree. One eats the fruit while the other watches, the one who eats fruit represents the individual self &quot;Jiva&quot; because it has sensual pleasure(taste) the second bird does not eat(denies the senses) and represents the Supreme Reality &quot;Atman&quot; [[sanskrit]]. They are both on the same &quot;tree of knowledge&quot; this symbolizes one body. In the Bible &quot;Jiva&quot; becomes [[Eve]]  &quot;Atman&quot; becomes [[Adam]] and Pippala becomes apple. This provides a philosophical interepretation for the origin of Adam and Eve, where Eve incurs sin for eating the fruit. &quot;Jiva&quot; in [[Sanskrit]] means &quot;life&quot; could also be the origins of the word &quot;live&quot;. In short only the complete control of the five senses leads to the Supreme Reality or [[God]] whereas sensual pleasure incurs ultimate unhappiness or [[sin]]. This theme runs through all the worlds major religions.

[[Image:Masaccio-TheExpulsionOfAdamAndEveFromEden-Restoration.jpg|thumb|When it was cleaned, [[Tommaso Masaccio]]'s [[fresco]] of ''The Expulsion'' (1426&amp;ndash;1427) lost the added fig leaves.]]
[[Early Renaissance art]]ists used the theme of Adam and Eve as a way to represent female and male nudes. Later, the nudity was objected to by more modest elements, and fig leaves were added to the older pictures and sculptures, covering their [[genital]]s. The choice of the [[fig tree|fig]] was a result of Mediterranean traditions identifying the unnamed ''Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil'' as a fig tree, and since figs leaves were actually mentioned in Genesis as being used to cover Adam and Eve's nudity.

In Northern Europe, the unnamed &quot;Forbidden fruit&quot; became considered a form of [[Apple (fruit)|apple]], partly since the [[germanic language|Germanic]] word ''apple'' originally meant any kind of fruit, only later becoming specialised. The [[larynx]] in the human throat, noticeably more prominent in males, was consequently called an ''[[Adam's apple]]'', from a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit sticking in Adam's throat as he swallowed, and the name has stuck. 

Some [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]] texts state that the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; was actually the [[grape]], that was later changed in its nature and made into something good, much as the serpent was changed by losing its legs and speech.

In [[Aramaic]], the spelling of the name of Eve - חיויה or חיווי - also means ''[[snake]]''. Perhaps coincidentally, there are some examples of iconography depicting Lilith with a snake wrapped around her. 

In late [[20th Century]] / early [[21st Century]] politics, the names of Adam and Eve are frequently invoked by those who oppose homosexuality on a religious basis, in the [[Anti-gay slogan|slogan]] &quot;God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve&quot;.

[[John Steinbeck]]'s [[1952]] novel ''[[East of Eden]]'' is based of the story of Adam, Eve, Cain and Abel.  It was later made in to a [[East of Eden (1955 film)|film]] starring [[James Dean]].

[[Cockney Rhyming Slang]] uses &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; to mean &quot;believe&quot; (e.g. &quot;Would you Adam and Eve it?&quot;, meaning &quot;Would you believe it?&quot;). This phrase is atypical, in that unlike most cockney rhyming slang, both the rhyming and non-rhyming parts are used.

In [[C.S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series of novels, the kings and queens that sit on Narnia's throne at the castle in Narnia's capital, Cair Paravel, are referred to as &quot;Sons of Adam&quot; and &quot;Daughters of Eve&quot;.  In the story, two male and two female humans are to sit on the four thrones of Cair Paravel to signify the return of peace to Narnia.

:''This article deals with the molecule ascorbic acid in General, for the nutrient see [[Vitamin C]]''

'''Ascorbic acid''' is an [[organic_chemistry| organic]] acid with [[antioxidant]] properties. Its appearance is  white to light yellow crystals or powder. It is water soluble. The L-[[enantiomer]] of ascorbic acid is commonly known as [[vitamin C]]. In [[1937]] the [[Nobel Prize]] for chemistry was awarded to [[Walter Haworth]] for his work in determining the structure of ascorbic acid (shared with [[Paul Karrer]], who received his award for work on vitamins), and the prize for Physiology or medicine that year went to [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] for his studies of the biological functions of L-ascorbic acid. 
__NOTOC__
== Chemistry ==
===Acidity===
The hydroxyls (OH) next to the bottom [[double bond]] are [[enol]]s. One enol loses an [[Lone pair|electron pair]], becoming an [[oxonium]] group (=OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), by creating a [[double bond]] to the carbon. Simultaneously, the carbon-carbon double bond (between the enols) transfers its electrons to form a double bond to the next (two-oxygen) carbon. To give way, the double bond electrons of the [[carbonyl]] are received by the carbonyl's oxygen, to produce an [[enolate]]. The oxonium promptly [[deprotonation|deprotonate]]s to produce a carbonyl, and this loss of protons gives ascorbic acid its [[acidity]]. The overall reaction is enol deprotonation to produce an [[enolate]], where the negative charge of the resulting enolate [[counterion]] is delocalized over the system of carbonyl (C=O) and the double bond (C=C). This delocalization makes the counterion more stable and less likely to regain the proton.
[[Image:Ascorbic acidity3.png|thumb|left|500px|Movement of electron pairs in deprotonation]]&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot;&gt;

===Tautomerism===
[[Image:Ascorbic diketone.png|frame|left|Attack of ascorbic enol on proton to give 1,3-diketone]]

Ascorbic acid also rapidly interconverts into two unstable [[diketone]] [[tautomer]]s by [[proton transfer]], although it is the most stable in the enol form. The proton of the enol is lost, and reacquired by electrons from the double bond, to produce a diketone. This is an [[enol]] reaction. There are two possible forms, 1,2-diketone and 1,3-diketone.&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

===Determination===
The concerntration of a solution of ascorbic acid can be determined in many ways, the most common ways involve [[titration]] with an [[oxidising agent]]. 
====Titrative Methods====
=====DCPIP=====
A commonly used oxidising agent is the dye 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol, or [[DCPIP]] for short. The blue dye is run into the ascorbic acid [[solution]] until a faint pink colour persists for 15 seconds.
=====Iodine=====
Another method involves using [[iodine]] and a [[starch]] [[indicator]], iodine reacts with ascorbic acid and when all the ascorbic acid has reacted the iodine is then in excess, forming a blue/black [[complex]] with the starch indicator. this indicates the end point of the titration.
=====Iodate and Iodine Ions=====
The above method involving iodine requires making up and standardising the iodine solution. One way round this is to generate the iodine in the presence of the ascorbic acid by the reaction of [[iodate]] and iodine ion in [[acid]] solution.
=====N-Bromosuccinimide=====
A much less common oxidising agent is [[N-bromosuccinimide]], (NBS). In this titration the NBS oxidises the ascorbic acid (in the presence of [[potassium iodide]] and starch). When the NBS is in excess (i.e. the reaction is complete) the NBS liberates the iodine from the potassium iodide which then form the blue/black complex with starch, indicating the end point of the titration.

== Uses ==

Ascorbic acid is easily oxidized and so is used as a reductant in photographic developer solutions (among others) and as a [[preservative]]. 

Exposure to oxygen, metals, light and heat destroy ascorbic acid, so it must be stored in dark and cold and not in a metal containment.  

The oxidized form of ascorbic acid is known as [[dehydroascorbic acid]].

The [[Optical isomerism|L-enantiomer]] of ascorbic acid is also known as [[vitamin C]] (the name &quot;ascorbic&quot; comes from its property of preventing and curing [[scurvy]]). [[Primate]]s (including humans) and a few other species in all divisions of the animal kingdom, notably the [[guinea pig]], have lost the ability to synthesise vitamin C and must obtain it in their food. 

Ascorbic acid and its sodium, potassium, and calcium [[salts]] are commonly used as [[antioxidant]] [[food additive]]s. These compounds are water soluble and thus cannot protect [[fats]] from oxidation: for this purpose, the fat-[[soluble]] [[ester]]s of ascorbic acid with long-chain [[fatty acid]]s (ascorbyl palmitate or ascorbyl stearate) can be used as food antioxidants.

The relevant European food additive [[E number]]s are:
E300 ascorbic acid,
E301 sodium ascorbate, E302 calcium ascorbate,
E303 potassium ascorbate, 
E304 fatty acid esters of ascorbic acid (i) [[ascorbyl palmitate]] (ii) [[ascorbyl stearate]].

==Antioxidant mechanism==

Ascorbate acts as an antioxidant by being itself available for energeticaly favourable oxidation. Oxidants (scientifically referred to as [[reactive oxygen species]]) such as the hydroxyl radical (formed from [[hydrogen peroxide]]), contain an unpaired electron and thus are highly reactive and damaging to humans and plants at the molecular level. This is due to their interaction with [[nucleic acid]], proteins and lipids. Reactive oxygen species can 'abstract' a hydrogen from ascorbate, which becomes monodehydroascorbate and soon gains another electron to become dehydroascorbate. The reactive oxygen species are reduced to water while the oxidized forms of ascorbate are relatively stable and unreactive, and do not cause cellular damage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ADSL standards}}
'''Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line''' ('''ADSL''') is a form of [[Digital Subscriber Line|DSL]], a data communications technology that enables faster data transmission over [[copper]] [[telephone]] lines than a conventional [[modem]] can provide. 

The distinguishing characteristic of ADSL over [[xDSL]] is that the volume of data flow is greater in one direction than the other, i.e. it is [[asymmetric]]. Providers usually market ADSL as a service for people to connect to the [[Internet]] in a relatively passive mode: able to use the higher speed direction for the &quot;[[download]]&quot; from the Internet but not needing to run servers that would require bandwidth in the other direction.

There are both technical and marketing reasons why ADSL is in many places the most common type offered to home users.  On the technical side, there is likely to be more [[crosstalk]] from other circuits at the [[Digital subscriber line access multiplexer|DSLAM]] end (where the wires from many local loops are close together) than at the customer premises.  Thus the upload signal is weakest at the noisiest part of the local loop, while the download signal is strongest at the noisiest part of the local loop.  It therefore makes technical sense to have the DSLAM transmit at a higher bit rate than does the modem on the customer end.  Since the typical home user in fact does prefer a higher download speed, the telephone companies chose to make a virtue out of necessity, hence ADSL.

For conventional ADSL, downstream rates start at 256 [[kbit/s]] and typically reach 8 [[Mbit/s]] within 1.5 km (5000 ft) of the DSLAM equipped central office or remote terminal. 
Upstream rates start at 64 kbit/s and typically reach 256 kbit/s but can go as high as 1024 kbit/s. The name [[ADSL Lite]] is sometimes used for the slower versions.

Note that distances are only approximations aimed at consumers of ADSL services. Signal [[attenuation]] and [[signal-to-noise ratio|Signal to Noise Ratio]] are defining characteristics, and can vary completely independently of distance (e.g., non-copper cabling, cable diameter). Real world performance is also dependent to the line impedance, which can change dynamically either dependent on weather conditions (very common for old overhead lines) or on the number and quality of joints or junctions in a particular cable length.

A newer variant called ADSL2 provides higher downstream rates of up to 12 Mbit/s for spans of less than 2.5 km (8000 ft). Higher [[symbol rate]]s and more advanced [[noise shaping]] are responsible for these increased speeds. ADSL2+, also referred to as [[ITU G.992.5]], boosts these rates to up to 24 Mbit/s for spans of less than 1.5 km (5000 feet). ADSL2+ also offers seamless bonding options, allowing lines with higher attenuation or lower signal to noise (SNR) ratios to be bonded together to achieve theoretically the sum total of the number of lines (i.e., up to 50 Mbit/s for two lines, etc.), as well as options in power management and seamless rate adaptation - changing the data rate used without requiring to resynchronize.

Because of the relatively low data-rate (compared to optical backbone networks), [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] is an appropriate technology for [[multiplexer|multiplexing]] time-critical data such as digital voice with less time-critical data such as [[web traffic]]; ADSL is commonly deployed  with ATM to ensure that this remains a possibility. In a [[triple play]] scenario, different ATM [[virtual circuit]]s (VCs) may be allocated for different services.

More recently, network operators are increasingly moving away from ATM, and towards [[Ethernet]]-based solutions, where [[IEEE 802.1Q|802.1Q]] and/or [[Virtual Private LAN Service|VPLS]] offer multiplexing solutions. The main reason for this switch is cost savings and the possibility of removing the older and more expensive ATM network.

ADSL service providers may offer either static or dynamic [[IP address]]ing. Static addressing is preferable for people who may wish to connect to their office via a [[virtual private network]], for some [[Internet]] gaming, and for those wishing to use ADSL to host a [[Web server]].

== How ADSL works ==

=== On the wire ===
ADSL uses two separate frequency bands. With standard ADSL, the band from 25.875 [[kHz]] to 138 kHz is used for upstream communication, while 138 kHz - 1104 kHz is used for downstream communication.

[[Image:ADSL_frequency_plan.svg|frame|Frequency plan for ADSL]]

Each of these is further divided into smaller chunks of 4.3125 kHz. During initial training, the ADSL modem tests which of the available chunks have an acceptable [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. The distance from the [[telephone exchange]], or noise on the copper wire, may introduce errors on some frequencies. By keeping the chunks small, an error on one frequency thus need not render the line unusable: the chunk will not be used, merely resulting in reduced throughput on an otherwise functional ADSL connection.

Vendors may support usage of higher frequencies as a proprietary extension to the standard. However, this requires matching vendor-supplied equipment on both ends of the line, and will likely result in crosstalk issues that affect other lines in the same bundle.

There is a direct relationship between the number of chunks available and the throughput capacity of the ADSL connection. The exact data capacity per chunk depends on the [[modulation]] method used.

A common error is to attribute the ''A'' in ''ADSL'' to the word [[asynchronous]]. ADSL technologies use a [[synchronous]] framed protocol for data transmission on the wire.

=== Modulation ===
ADSL initially existed in two flavors (similar to [[VDSL]]), namely [[Carrierless Amplitude Phase Modulation|CAP]] and [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|DMT]]. CAP was the ''de facto'' standard for ADSL deployments up until [[1996]], deployed in 90 percent of ADSL installs at the time. However, DMT was chosen for the first ITU-T ADSL standards, G.992.1 and G.992.2 (also called ''G.dmt'' and ''G.lite'' respectively). Therefore, all modern installations of ADSL are based on the DMT modulation scheme.

'''Amsterdamsche Football Club Ajax''' ({{Euronext|AJAX}}) also referred to as '''Ajax Amsterdam''', '''AFC Ajax''', or simply '''Ajax''' (pronounced ''Ah-yahx''), is a [[football (soccer)|football]] club from [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. The club is historically one of the top-10 football clubs in the world, and one of the 'Big Three' clubs that dominate Dutch football, the other two being [[Feyenoord Rotterdam]] and [[PSV Eindhoven]]. Ajax is one of only four clubs to have won all three major European trophies at least once (the European Champions Cup, the European Cup Winners Cup and the UEFA Cup). They were the first team to win what has become the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]].

==History==
The club was founded in Amsterdam on [[March 18]], [[1900]] by Floris Stempel, Carel Reeser and the brothers Han and Johan Dade. Ajax originally played in an all black uniform with a red sash tied around the players' waists, but that uniform was soon replaced by a red/white striped shirt and black shorts. Red, black and white are the three colours of the flag of [[Amsterdam]]. However, when the club got promoted to the top flight of Dutch football in 1911 (then the Eerste Klasse or First Class, later named the [[Eredivisie]]), Ajax were forced to change their colours, because [[Sparta Rotterdam]] already had the exact same outfit. Special kits for away fixtures did not exist at the time and according to football association regulations, the newcomers had to change their colours if two teams in the same league had identical uniforms. Loosely inspired by the kit of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], Ajax opted for white shorts and white shirt with a broad, vertical red stripe over chest and back, which still is Ajax's outfit. Today, it is one of the most recognised football jerseys in the world. 

Ajax dominated European club football during the early 1970's by winning the European Champion Club's Cup in 1971, 1972 and 1973. The success had two main causes: the highly disciplined coaching by [[Rinus Michels]] and the genius of [[Johan Cruijff]]. From the 1960's onwards Ajax had developed the concept of [[total football]], ending the traditional division of labour between defenders, midfielders and attackers. All players were to participate in all aspects of the game, in an organization that would fill gaps when a player moved to a different position.

The club is also famous for its excellent youth program and has introduced a many great footballers - Cruijff being the best example. Its satellite club is the [[Ajax Cape Town]] of [[South Africa]] from where youth players have been drafted into the [[Eredivisie]] squad, such as [[Steven Pienaar]] and [[Aaron Mokoena]]. In 1995, the year that they won the [[UEFA Champions League]], Ajax was the team that could best represent the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] in all departments, with [[goalkeeper]] [[Edwin van der Sar]], players such as [[Michael Reiziger]], [[Frank de Boer]] and [[Danny Blind]] in defense, [[Ronald de Boer]], [[Edgar Davids]] and [[Clarence Seedorf]] in midfield, and [[Patrick Kluivert]] and [[Marc Overmars]] in attack. The team was coached by [[Louis van Gaal]], and also featured foreign stars such as [[Jari Litmanen]], [[Nwankwo Kanu]] and [[Finidi George]]. Its current successes are mostly domestic, notwithstanding some minor successes in the 2002-03 Champions League. Its youth team continues to develop fairly talented individuals like [[Rafael van der Vaart]], [[Wesley Sneijder]], [[Nigel de Jong]], [[Johnny Heitinga]], [[Hedwiges Maduro]] and [[Ryan Babel]] who regularly represent their nation.

After their success with the 1995 Champions League, Ajax has since struggled to rediscover its European form but first they will need to dominate the Eredivisie. Players such as [[Shota Arveladze]] and [[Brian Laudrup]] have won over the fans in the late 1990s but have yet to make their abundance of talents count in major tournaments. Most recently in 2005, popular coach, [[Ronald Koeman]] resigned after Ajax's defeat to [[AJ Auxerre]] in the [[UEFA Cup]] tournament despite having a squad packed with international experience, declaring himself drained of any inspiration to further guide the team to any success. This resignation was also the aftermath of Koeman's long-standing spat with then football director [[Louis van Gaal]] who had questioned Koeman's managerial abilities after Ajax's dry spell in the domestic league which even saw them languishing in fifth position at the beginning of 2005. Koeman's replacement was widely tipped to be as of a manager with vast experience, so it may come as a surprise when former Ajax-player [[Danny Blind]] was unveiled as their new coach, with virtually no top-level manager experience although he had worked with Koeman as a technical coach and advisor. The season may also witness the restructuring of the club with key players [[Rafael van der Vaart]] and [[Nigel de Jong]] joining [[Hamburger SV]], while four others ([[Hatem Trabelsi]], [[Tomas Galasek]], [[Steven Pienaar]] and Maxwell) have already revealed that they will leave the club at the end of the 2005-2006 season. The recent addition of [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]] from [[SC Heerenveen]],as well as the improved play of [[Markus Rosenberg]] are reasons that the fans still have hope for success in the coming years.

==Stadium==
Ajax's first stadium was built in 1911 out of wood and was simply called The Stadium. Ajax later played in the stadium that was built for the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], held in Amsterdam. This stadium, designed by Jan Wils, is simply known as the [[Olympisch Stadion (Amsterdam)|Olympic Stadium]]. In 1934, Ajax moved to [[De Meer Stadion]] in east Amsterdam, where they would play until 1996.  De Meer stadium was an unusually small stadium for such a large club, but the small stadium also created a cozy atmosphere.  During big European fixtures the club would often play at the Olympic Stadium, where the capacity was higher.

In 1996, Ajax moved to a new home ground in the southeast of the city known as the [[Amsterdam ArenA]], that was built at the cost of $134 million.  The stadium is capable of holding approximately 52,000 people. The average attendance in 2004/05 was 48,600 people. The Arena has a retractable roof and was the example for other modern stadiums built in Europe in the following years. In the Netherlands, the Arena has earned a reputation for having a terrible grass pitch. The condition of the grass is caused by the roof that, even when open, takes away too much sunlight and ventilation from the ground. 

The much loved De Meer stadium was torn down and the land was sold to the city council.

==Jewish influence==


''Reference: [http://www.ajax-usa.com/desk/ajax-and-the-jewish-issue.html Ajax and the Jewish issue]''

The Ajax fans have the very remarkable tradition of using [[Jewish]] and [[Israeli]] symbols to express their allegiance. Regularly, the supporters wave large [[Star of David]] flags and scream ''Joden! Joden!'' (&quot;Jews! Jews!&quot;) to fire up their team.  Die-hard Ajax supporters call themselves &quot;Joden&quot; or &quot;Super-Joden&quot; -- Dutch for &quot;Super Jews&quot; -- a nickname that reflects the team's and Amsterdam's Jewish roots. The nickname for Ajax fans dates back to before World War II, when Amsterdam was home to many of the Netherlands' 140,000 Jews and the Ajax stadium was located near a Jewish neighborhood. Most Dutch Jews were killed in the Holocaust, and little remains of Amsterdam's old Jewish quarter. But the tradition survived.

The problem is that in an increasingly bizarre way, opposing supporters use [[anti-semitism]] to express their antipathy towards Ajax. When playing Ajax, opposing fans have been spotted to to imitate the whistling sound of [[gas chambers]] and to sing the extremely racist chant ''[[Hamas]], Hamas, alle Joden aan het gas'' (&quot;Hamas, Hamas, all the Jews [Ajax supporters] on the gas&quot;). On the other side, the hardcore Ajax fans are proud of their outsider image as &quot;Jews&quot; and feel encouraged to show more Israeli/ Jewish signs. The ''real'' Jews who support Ajax are split on this matter.

As of 2006, an evaluation on this matter is still highly debatable.

==Rivalry==

Although Ajax has fought with [[PSV]] for the championship in recent years, its main rivalry is with [[Feyenoord]], culminating  every year in the &quot;[[Klassieker (Ajax-Feyenoord)|Klassieker]]&quot;. It is a match between the two largest cities of the Netherlands, one of which identifies with artists and creativity (Amsterdam) and one with hard work. There have been many clashes between the supporters of both clubs, of which the Beverwijk clash in 1997 was the most infamous, leading to the death of [[Ajax Amsterdam|Ajax]]-supporter Carlo Picornie. 

Fans of [[FC Utrecht]] think of Ajax as its most hated opponent as well. Ajax fans didn't really care about this rivalry, although recently, following a few defeats, Utrecht has become more hated by Ajax fans as well.

Sir '''Arthur Stanley Eddington''', [[Order of Merit|OM]] ([[December 28]], [[1882]] &amp;ndash; [[November 22]], [[1944]]) was arguably the most important [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] from the early [[20th century]]. The [[Eddington limit]], the natural limit to the [[luminosity]] that can be radiated by accretion onto a compact object, is named in his honour. 

He is famous for his work regarding the [[Theory of relativity|Theory of Relativity]]. Eddington wrote an article in 1919, ''Report on the relativity theory of gravitation'', which announced [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] to the English-speaking world. Because of [[World War I]], new developments in German science were not well known in England.

==Biography==
===Early years===

Eddington was born in [[Kendal]], [[England]], son of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] parents. His father, Arthur Henry Eddington, taught at a Quaker training college in Lancashire before moving to Kendal to become headmaster of Stramongate School. He died in the [[typhoid]] epidemic which swept England in 1884. His mother, Sarah Ann Stout, came from Darlington and was also from a Quaker family. When his father died, she was left to bring up Arthur and his older sister with relatively little income. The family moved to [[Weston-super-Mare]] where at first Arthur was educated at home before spending three years at a preparatory school.

In 1893 Arthur entered Brymelyn School. He proved to be a brilliant scholar and excelled in mathematics and English literature. His records won him a 60 pounds scholarship in 1898, and was able to attend [[Victoria University of Manchester|Owens College]] in [[Manchester]] once he turned 16 later that year. He spent the first year in a general course, but turned to [[physics]] for the next three years. Eddington was greatly influenced by one of his mathematics teachers, [[Horace Lamb]]. His progress continued to be rapid, winning him several additional scholarships and allowing him to graduate with a B.Sc. with First Class Honours in 1902.

Based on his performance at Owens, he was awarded a 75 pound scholarship at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which he entered in 1903. He graduated with a masters in 1905, and entered the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] researching [[thermionic emission]]. This did not go well so he returned to mathematics, but appeared to not enjoy this very much.

===Astronomy===
[[Image:Eddington 5.jpeg|thumb|250px|Eddington helped to experimentally verify the theory of general relativity by observing the appearance of stars around the region of a solar eclipse.]]

After leaving university later in 1905, Eddington's first full-time position was as the chief assistant to the Astronomer Royal at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. He was put to work on the detailed analysis [[parallax]] of [[Eros]] on [[photographic plate]]s that had started in 1900. He developed a new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars, winning him the Smith's Prize in 1907.

The prize won him a Trinity College Fellowship. In December 1912 [[George Darwin]], son of [[Charles Darwin]], died suddenly and Eddington was promoted to his chair as the [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy]] in early 1913. Later that year, [[Robert Ball]], holder of the theoretical [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry|Lowndean chair]] also died, and Eddington was named the director of the entire [[Cambridge Observatory]] the next year. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] shortly thereafter.

During [[World War I]], Eddington was called up for [[military service]]. Being a member of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and a [[pacifism|pacifist]], he refused to serve in the army as a [[conscientious objector]], and wanted to be allowed to do alternative service instead. Scientific friends of his solved the problem by successfully arguing to relieve him from military duty because of his importance for science.

[[Image:1919 eclipse negative.jpg|250px|thumb|right|One of Eddington's photographs of the 1919 eclipse, presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success.]]

After the war, Eddington travelled to the island of [[Príncipe]] near Africa to watch the [[solar eclipse]] of [[May 29]] [[1919]]. During the eclipse, he took pictures of the stars in the region around the Sun. According to the theory of [[general relativity]], stars near the Sun would appear to have been slightly shifted because their light had been curved by its gravitational field. This effect is noticeable only during an eclipse, since otherwise the Sun's brightness obscures the stars. Newtonian gravitation predicted half the shift of general relativity.

Eddington's observations confirmed Einstein's theory, and were hailed at the time as a conclusive proof of general relativity over the Newtonian model; the news was reported in newspapers all over the world as a major story. It is also the source of the [[urban rumor]] that only three people understand relativity; when asked by a reporter who suggested this, Eddington jokingly replied &quot;Oh, who's the third?&quot;

However, recent historical examinations of the case have shown that the raw data was inconclusive, and that Eddington was arbitrarily selective in choosing which results to use. For a detailed account, see [[Predictive power#Relativity and the 1919 eclipse|predictive power]].

Eddington also investigated the interior of [[star]]s through theory, and developed the first true understanding of stellar processes. He modelled stars as gas in radiative equilibrium; the star was stabilized by gravity pulling in, and gas pressure (temperature) and radiation pressure pushing out. Noting that the temperatures meant that the atoms in stars would be almost entirely [[ion]]ized, he theorized that they would behave as almost-[[ideal gas]]es, thereby making the mathematics much more tractable.

With these assumptions, he demonstrated that the interior temperature of stars must be millions of degrees. He discovered the mass-luminosity relationship for [[star]]s, he calculated the abundance of hydrogen and he produced a theory to explain the pulsation of [[Cepheid variable]] stars.

In [[1920]],  Eddington, on the basis of the precise measurements of atomic weights by [[Francis William Aston|F. W. Aston]], was the first to suggest that stars obtained their energy from [[nuclear fusion]] of [[hydrogen]] to [[helium]]. This was the first suggestion that stars obtained their energy from nuclear fusion, over which he had a long running argument with [[James Jeans]]. Later, in 1938 and 1939, [[Hans Bethe]] introduced the theory for the fusion, which made the process seem rather &quot;natural&quot; and the debate generally ended.

Throughout this period Eddington lectured on relativity, and was particularly well known for his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific. He collected many of these into the ''Mathematical Theory of Relativity'' in 1923, which [[Albert Einstein]] suggested was ''the finest presentation of the subject in any language.''

===Fundamental theory===
During [[1920s]] until his death, he increasingly concentrated on what he called &quot;[[Theory of everything|fundamental theory]]&quot; which was intended to be a unification of [[quantum theory]], [[theory of relativity|relativity]] and [[gravitation]]. At first he progressed along &quot;traditional&quot; lines, but turned increasingly to an almost [[numerology|numerological]] analysis of the dimensionless ratios of fundamental constants. His work was increasingly seen as &quot;crankish&quot;, and he became something of a science pariah in his later years.

His basic approach was to combine several fundamental constants in order to produce a dimensionless number. In many cases these would result in numbers close to 10&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;40&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, its square, or its cube root. He was convinced that the mass of the [[proton]] and the charge of the [[electron]], were a ''natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe'' and that their values were not accidental. One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics, [[P. A. M. Dirac]], also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis]], and some scientists even today believe it has something to it.

A particularly damaging statement in his defence of these concepts involved the  [[fine structure constant]] α. At the time it was measured to be very close to 1/136, and he argued that the value should in fact be ''exactly'' 1/136 for various reasons. Later measurements placed the value much closer to 1/137, at which point he switched his line of reasoning and claimed that the value should in fact be exactly 1/137, the [[Eddington number]]. At this point most other researchers stopped taking his concepts very seriously. The current measured value is estimated at 1/137.03599911.

He did not complete this line of research before his death in 1944, and his book entitled ''Fundamental Theory'' was published posthumously in 1946. Eddington died in [[Cambridge]], [[England]].

It was rather unfortunate that he vehemently opposed the budding Indian scientist [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] about his theory on the maximum mass of stars known as white dwarfs, the mass above which the star collapses and becomes a [[neutron star]], quark star or [[black hole]]. Chandrasekhar was proven to be right, and went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983.

'''Anteaters''' are [[mammal]]s  of 4 species of the order [[Xenarthra]] and the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Myrmecophagidae''', commonly known for eating [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s. 
==Physiology==
The largest representative of the group is the Giant Anteater or Ant-bear (''Myrmecophaga tridactyla'' or ''jubata''), an animal measuring 4 feet (1.2 m) in length without the tail, and 2 feet (60 cm) in height at the shoulder. It has a long, thin head and a large, bushy tail.  Its prevailing color is grey, with a broad black band, bordered with white, starting on the chest, and passing obliquely over the shoulder, diminishing gradually in breadth as it approaches the loins, where it ends in a point.

It is extensively distributed in the tropical parts of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], frequenting low swampy savannas, along the banks of rivers, and the depths of the humid forests, but is nowhere abundant.

Its food consists mainly of [[termite]]s, which it obtains by opening their nests with its powerful sharp anterior (front) claws.  As the insects swarm to the damaged part of their dwelling, it draws them into its mouth by means of its long, flexible, rapidly moving tongue covered with sticky saliva. 

The Giant Anteater lives above ground, not burrowing underground like [[armadillo]]s. Though generally an inoffensive animal, when attacked it can defend itself with its sabre-like anterior claws. The female produces one offspring per birth.

The two tamandua anteaters, as typified by ''Tamandua'' (or ''Uroleptes'') ''tetradactyla'', are much smaller than the Giant Anteater, and differ essentially from it in their habits, being mainly arboreal. They inhabit the dense primeval forests of South and Central America. The usual colour is yellowish-white, with a broad black lateral band, covering nearly the whole of the side of the body.

The little or two-toed or Silky Anteater (''Cyclopes'' or ''Cyclotorus didactylus'') is a native of the hottest parts of South and Central America, and about the size of a [[rat]], of a general yellowish color, and exclusively arboreal in its habits.
==Family order==
* '''ORDER XENARTHRA'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexis Korner''' ([[April 19]], [[1928]] Paris - [[January 1]], [[1984]] London), was an English [[blues music]]ian. 

Korner is probably better remembered as a networker and blues historian alhough he was a proficient guitarist and singer himself. Often referred to as &quot;the father of British blues&quot;, Korner was instrumental in bringing together various English blues musicians, such as [[John Mayall]] as well as [[Brian Jones]], [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]], who went on to form the [[Rolling Stones]].  

He also brought previously unknown American blues artists to England to perform. There is an apocryphal story that the Rolling Stones went to stay at Korner's house late one night, in the early '60s, after a performance. They entered in the accepted way, by climbing in through the kitchen window, to find [[Muddy Waters]]'s band sleeping on the kitchen floor.

Always a blues purist, Korner criticised better-known British blues musicians, during the blues boom of the late '60s, for their blind adherence to [[Chicago blues]], as if the music came in no other form.  

Ironically, he would have his greatest commercial success in the early [[1970s]] with a [[jazz-rock]] band
called [[C. C. S. (pop group)|C. C. S.]] - short for ''The Collective Consciousness Society'', formed with musical director [[John Cameron]], singer [[Peter Thorup]] and record producer [[Mickie Most]].  They had hits with &quot;[[Walkin']]&quot;, &quot;[[Tap Turns on the Water]]&quot;, &quot;[[Brother (song)|Brother]]&quot; which later became the theme tune to the Top 20 (later Top 40) on [[BBC]] [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], &quot;[[The Band Played the Boogie]]&quot;, and the best-remembered, an instrumental version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s &quot;[[Whole Lotta Love]]&quot;. This version was used for many years as the theme music for the [[television]] show &quot;[[Top Of The Pops]]&quot;.  

After they disbanded in 1974 he formed another group, [[Snape (group)|Snape]].  In his last years, he turned more to broadcasting, and presented a weekly blues and soul show for [[BBC]] [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:M113.jpg|thumb|right|The [[M113]], one of the most common tracked APCs, on duty during the [[Vietnam War]].]]

'''Armoured personnel carriers''' (APCs) are light [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s for the transport of [[infantry]].  They usually have only a [[machine gun]] although variants carry [[recoilless rifle]]s, [[anti-tank guided missile]]s (ATGMs), or [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s.  They are not really designed to take part in a direct-fire battle, but to carry the troops to the battlefield safe from [[shrapnel]] and [[ambush]]. They may have [[wheel]]s or [[Caterpillar track|tracks]]. Examples include the American [[M113]] (tracked), the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[FV 432 AFV|FV 432]] (tracked), the [[France|French]] [[Véhicule de l'Avant Blindé|VAB]] (wheeled), the [[Germany|German]] [[Boxer MRAV]] (wheeled) and the Soviet [[BTR-60 |BTR]] (wheeled).

==History==
[[Image:Bt7 6.jpg|thumb|right|Before the advent of APCs, some forces practised very dangerous [[tank desant]] tactics]]

During [[World War I]], when the [[tank]] was developed, the British [[Mark I (tank)|Mark V]] tank was designed with a small passenger compartment to carry troops.  By some definitions this can be considered the first armoured personnel carrier.  The first specialised APC was the [[Mark IX tank|Mark IX]] of [[1918]].

Often, APCs were simply armoured cars with the capacity for carrying troops, but they evolved into purpose-built vehicles to suit the demands of motorised warfare from [[World War II]]. 

In [[1944]], the commander of [[2nd Canadian Corps]], General [[Guy Simonds]], ordered the conversion of 72 [[United States|US]]-produced [[M7 Priest]] self-propelled [[howitzer]]s to personnel carriers.  They were due for replacement anyway, as the howitzer barrels were worn out.  The howitzer was removed, and the resulting hole was plugged with whatever steel was available.  The vehicle was called [[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroo]], after the workshop which did the conversion. Later in the war Canadian-built [[Ram tank|Ram]] tanks were used as a basis for the majority of conversions, as they were then obsolete and the original Kangaroos were worn out.

After the war different specialised APCs were developed.  The United States developed a series of tracked vehicles, culminating in the M113 &quot;box on tracks&quot;, of which 80,000 were made.  The [[Soviet Union]] developed the wartime [[BTR-40]] into a series of 8-wheeled APC.

At the end of the [[1980s]], [[Israel]] converted captured [[T-55]] tanks to APCs, reminiscent of WWII conversions.  The result is one of the best protected APCs in the world, called [[IDF Achzarit]].

==Technology==
[[Image:VAB armoured personnel carrier DSC00846.jpg|right|thumb|A French VAB, one of the most common wheeled APCs]]

Most armoured personnel carriers use a [[diesel engine]] comparable to that used in a large [[truck]] or in a typical city [[bus]] (APCs are often known to troops as 'Battle Taxis' or 'Battle Buses').  The M113 for instance used the same engine as the standard [[General Motors]] urban bus.  A single M113 moving at top speed generates as much noise as a General Motors urban bus moving at top speed.  However, the typical armoured personnel carrier can carry only six to ten soldiers while a typical urban bus can carry thirty to fifty seated passengers, and hundreds when standing passengers are included.

Most APCs are amphibious.  Usually tracked APCs are powered by their tracks in the water, and wheeled APCs have propellors or [[water jet]]s.  Preparations for amphibious operations usually comprises checking the integrity of the hull and folding down a trim wane in front.  Swimming required fairly still waters, and good entry and exit points.  Speed in water is typically 3-6 km/h.

Armour on APCs are usually simple steel or [[aluminium]] armour, sufficient for protection against small arms fire and most shell fragments.  Just about any type of anti-tank weapon can defeat the armour of an APC.

The usual armament for an APC is a 12.7 (.50) or 14.5 mm heavy [[machine gun]].  This is mounted on top of the vehicle, either on a simple [[pintle mount]], sometimes with a gun shield, or a small turret.  Sometimes an automatic [[grenade launcher]] is used instead.

==The APC in action==
[[Image:BTR-80 and Bradley.jpg|right|thumb|APC vs. IFV: [[United States|US]] [[M2 Bradley]] IFV on the left and [[Russia|Russian]] [[BTR-80]] APC on the right]]
[[Image:Stryker deployment.jpg|right|thumb|US infantrymen de-bussing from a [[Stryker]] wheeled APC.  Note the lowered ramp for easy access.]]

[[Romania]]n Transporter Auto Blindat APCs that made infamous front-line news in 1989 were mostly eight-wheeled, massive Romanian clones of the Soviet [[BTR-60]] APC. Soldiers hated this machine, with uncomfortable access from above and heavy latches that seemed designed to snap one's fingers off. Limited visibility and clumsy manoeuvrability in an urban environment might have contributed (along with bad will, of course) to the numbers of deaths through crushing during the [[Romanian Revolution]].

The idea of the APC has arrived in the modern era to become the [[IFV]], from which troops can fight, firing their weapons from ports in the vehicle, instead of just being transported by it; examples being the US [[M2 Bradley]] or Russian [[BMP-1|BMP]] series. 

Actual combat experience has however shown that infantry cannot fight effectively from their vehicle and a mounted attack is practically suicidal. As a result, most infantry vehicles no longer have firing ports; most of those on the M2 Bradley for example have been covered over by additional armour protection. They have been omitted completely from newer designs. As a result the main distinction between an APC and IFV is now simply that an IFV mounts an automatic cannon of 20-40mm calibre for heavier fire support and anti armour capability, while an APC is armed only with machine guns. 

Many APC designs have been converted to IFVs by the addition of such an automatic cannon, and many chassis’s are produced in both machine gun and grenade launcher armed APC and cannon armed IFV form. The reason for doing this may be cost, or the need for more interior space on some vehicles, as automatic cannon and their ammunition supply may reduce the number of infantry that can be carried.

      <comment>/* World War II */ some minor additions and rephrasing; and BTW SU-85 was a tank destroyer, not an assault gun</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''assault gun''' is a [[gun]] or [[howitzer]] mounted on a motor vehicle or armored chassis, designed for use in the [[direct fire]] role in support of [[infantry]] when attacking other infantry or fortified positions.

Historically the custom-built fully armored assault guns usually mounted the gun or howitzer in a fully enclosed casemate on a tank chassis. The use of a casemate instead of a turret limited these weapons' field of fire, but provided a simpler construction that was cheaper to build and less prone to mechanical breakdowns. The increased space and reduced weight of the turretless design also allowed mounting a larger weapon and providing heavier frontal armor on any given chassis, and in most cases these turretless vehicles also presented a lower profile as a target for the enemy.

==History==

===World War II===
[[Image:KW-2 1940.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Soviet [[KV-2]] &quot;Heavy Assault Tank&quot; was really an assault gun, 1940.]]

Assault guns were primarily used during [[World War II]], in the hands of the [[Germany|Germans]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviets]]. Early in the war the Germans began to create makeshift assault guns by mounting their infantry support weapons on the bed of a truck or on obsolete [[tank]]s with the turret removed. Later in the war both the Germans and the Soviets introduced fully armored purpose-built assault guns into their arsenals.

Early on the Soviets built the KV-2, a variant of the [[KV-1]] heavy tank with a short-barreled 152mm howitzer mounted in an oversized turret. They later produced a very successful series of increasingly powerful turretless assault guns on the KV, the [[SU-76]], [[SU-122]], and the heavy [[SU-152]], which were followed by the [[ISU-122]] and [[ISU-152]] on the newer [[Iosif Stalin tank|IS]] heavy tank chassis.

[[Image:StugIII at Kursk.jpg|thumb|right|250px|German [[StuG III]] with high-velocity 75mm gun, 1943.]]

The primary German assault gun was the [[Sturmgeschütz III]] (StuG III). Armed with a high-velocity dual-purpose 75mm gun, late production StuG III variants blurred the line between assault guns and [[tank destroyer]]s. The Germans also built a number of other fully armored turretless assault guns, including the [[StuG IV]], [[Sturmgeschütz_III#Variants|StuH 42]], [[Brummbär]], [[Sturmtiger]]. The latter two were very heavy vehicles, built only in small quantities.

Battalions of assault guns, usually StuG IIIs, commonly replaced the intended panzer battalion in the German [[Panzergrenadier|panzergrenadier divisions]] due to the chronic shortage of tanks, and were sometimes used as makeshifts even in the [[panzer division]]s. Independent battalions were also deployed as 'stiffeners' for infantry divisions, and the StuG III's anti-tank capabilities contributed much to the German's ability to draw out the war long after they had lost the strategic initiative.

=== Postwar use ===

In the post-[[World War II|WWII]] era a second use was envisioned for the assault gun, as a light-weight air-deployable direct fire weapon for use with airborne troops. Current weapons were either based on [[jeep]]s or small [[Caterpillar track|tracked]] vehicles and the airborne troops thus always fought at a distinct disadvantage in terms of heavy weapons.

The US was the first to build an assault gun in this category, the 152mm armed [[M551 Sheridan]]. The Sheridan's gun was a low-velocity weapon suitable in the assault role, but with the addition of the [[Shillelagh missile]] could double in the anti-tank role as well. The Sheridan was generally considered a failure however, and largely detested by its crews.

An attempt to address the Sheridan's problems and provide the airborne divisions with a modern weapon system developed into the [[M8 Armored Gun System]] (or ''AGS''). However the AGS was continually stung with budget cuts and program changes, and was never produced. Instead a wheeled vehicle based on the standard LAV III wheeled chassis is being deployed with the 105mm gun as the [[Stryker]], with similar characteristics as the [[Centauro]] Wheeled Tank Destroyer of the [[Italian army|Italian Army]] and the French [[AMX 10 RC]].

Another country to 'retry' the assault gun after [[World War II]] was Sweden with the [[Stridsvagn_103|Stridsvagn 103]], developped in the 50's. After minor modifications, it came into service in 1966 and was used untill phased it in 1997 with the arrival of the [[Leopard II]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A self-propelled anti-tank gun, or '''tank destroyer''', is a type of [[armoured fighting vehicle]].  Tank destroyers are used primarily to provide [[antitank]] support for [[infantry]] or [[tank]] units, in [[defence (military) | defensive]] or [[withdrawal (military) |withdrawal]] operations. They may mount a high-velocity anti-tank gun or sometimes an [[antitank guided missile]] launcher, or ATGM.

Tank destroyers cannot fulfil the many roles of tanks; they are much less flexible, and usually lack a strong anti-infantry capability.  But they are much less expensive to manufacture, maintain, and resupply than tanks.

Gun-armed tank destroyers have been largely supplanted by the more general-purpose tanks since Second World War, but lightly-armoured ATGM carriers are used for supplementary long-range antitank capabilities.

== World War II ==

[[Image:ISU-122 skos RB.jpg|thumb|350px|Soviet [[ISU-122]] tank destroyer with Polish Army markings]]

Dedicated antitank vehicles made their first major appearance in [[the Second World War]], as combatants developed effective armoured vehicles and tactics.

These tank destroyers fell broadly into two categories. Some were designed to be faster and cheaper than medium tanks while still able to destroy heavy armour at long range. Some of these designs were clearly expedients rushed into production. The second design strategy was to create heavily-armoured vehicles that were more effective tank destroyers than enemy tanks.

[[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] designs mounted anti-tank guns, with limited traverse in turretless hulls.  The results were smaller, lighter, and simpler to build than tanks, but could carry larger guns.   This design methodology was used by both forces to provide heavier anti-tank capability at lower cost, during the rapid up-armoring of all AFVs that took place during the war.

For instance, the German [[Panzer I]] light tank was obsolete before the war even started, with thin armor and only machine guns for armament. Yet it was forced into battle during the invasion of [[Poland]], where it was found to be a death trap. Before the invasion of [[France]], 202 were rebuilt as [[Panzerjäger I]] self-propelled 47mm anti-tank guns. Soon the same sort of thing happened to [[Panzer II]] tanks during [[Operation Barbarossa]]: captured Soviet 76.2mm anti-tank guns were mounted on [[Panzer II]] chassis, producing [[Marder II]] anti-tank guns. The most common mounting was a German 75mm antitiank gun on the Czech [[Panzer 38(t)]] chassis to produce the [[Marder III]]. 

Whereas the [[Panzerjäger]]s (&quot;tank hunters&quot;) were based on the rebuilt chassis of obsolescent tanks, dedicated [[Jagdpanzer]] (&quot;hunting tank&quot;) versions of tanks were developed later in the war.  The [[Jagdpanther]] on the [[Panther tank]]'s chassis is considered the best of the Jagdpanzers. This vehicle mounted the L/71 version of the [[88mm gun]] on a reliable, highly mobile, well-armored chassis. The Soviets produced the 85mm [[SU-85]] and 100mm [[SU-100]] self-propelled guns based on the same chassis as the [[T-34]] medium tank, as well as the 122mm [[ISU-122]] and 152mm [[ISU-152]] which shared components with the [[IS-2]] heavy tank.  In 1943, the Soviets also shifted all production of light tanks like the [[T-70]] to much simpler and better-armed [[SU-76]] self-propelled guns, which used the same drive train.

The Germans became side-tracked into production of large numbers of tank-destroyers because they could be produced more cheaply than full tanks.   

=== US Army tank destroyer doctrine ===

[[U.S.]] and derivative [[United Kingdom|British]] designs were very different in conception. U.S. doctrine was based on the need to defeat German [[blitzkrieg]] tactics. U.S. units expected to be faced with large numbers of German tanks attacking on relatively narrow fronts. In actual practice, such attacks rarely happened. In pre–Second World War planning, U.S. tanks were not intended to fight enemy tanks directly. Instead they were dedicated to the roles of infantry support and exploitation in a fast moving battle. In order to deal with the enemy tanks U.S. forces would instead rely on separate tank destroyer units, which could deal with armor at long range.

The U.S. tank destroyer designs were intended to be very mobile and heavily armed. Most retained a turret, but left it open on top both to save weight and to accommodate a larger gun. The earliest expedient design was an [[M3 Half-track|M3 half-track]] mounting an M1897 75mm gun in a limited-traverse mount. The larger guns required a counterweight at rear of the turret, which can be seen on designs like the 3-inch gun [[M10 Wolverine]] and the 90 mm gun [[M36 Jackson]]. The [[M18 Hellcat|M18]] came closer to the U.S. ideal; the vehicle was very fast, small, and mounted a 76mm gun in a turret. The open top made these particularly vulnerable to artillery, air, and infantry assault, and the very idea of independent anti-tank groups was found unworkable. 

By [[1944]], a number of the &quot;basic&quot; [[Sherman tank|Sherman]]s in British use were being converted to [[Sherman Fireflies]] by adding [[17 pounder]] guns—giving each platoon of Shermans a dedicated anti-tank gun. In British service, 17-pounders were also mounted M10 Wolverine (&quot;Achilles&quot;) and [[Archer (tank destroyer)|Archer]] tank destroyers in the [[Comet tank|Comet]], the [[Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger|Challenger]] and the experimental [[Black Prince (tank)|Black Prince]] tanks.

Virtually every U.S. Infantry Division had an attached battalion of tank destroyers, and frequently also a tank battalion. In practice the two types of units were used interchangeably. In effect, the U.S. Army had a mix of vehicles that were either under-armed (the tanks) or under-armored (the tank destroyers). At the end of the war, the arrival of the more balanced [[M26 Pershing]] heavy tank design showed that the lesson had been learnt.

== Post–World War II development ==

In the face of the Warsaw Pact, a general need for extra firepower was identified. In the 1950s, the UK produced the Charioteer to beef up the tank regiments, mounting a 20 pounder gun in an oversize turret on the Cromwell tank hull - it lacked the all round capability of the Centurion tank.

With the development of flexible ATGMs which can be installed on almost any vehicle in the [[1960s]], the concept of the tank destroyer has waned.  
With the weight of main battle tanks growing to the forty to seventy-tonne range, airborne forces were unable to deploy reasonable antitank forces. The result was a number of attempts to make a light vehicle, including the conventional [[ASU-85]], the recoilless rifle–armed [[Ontos]], and missile-armed [[Malkara missile#FV1620 Humber Hornet|Hornet Malkara]] armoured car and [[M551 Sheridan|Sheridan]] light tank.

==Modern tank destroyers==
Many forces' [[IFV]]s carry ATGMs in every infantry platoon, and attack [[helicopter]]s have also added antitank capability to the modern battlefield.  But there are still dedicated antitank vehicles with very heavy long-range missiles, and ones intended for airborne use. 

[[Image:NM142 x 3.jpg|thumb|250px|A Norwegian antitank platoon equipped with [[NM142]] TOW missile launchers]]

There have also been dedicated antitank vehicles built on ordinary [[armoured personnel carrier]] or [[armoured car]] chassis. Examples include the U.S. M901 &quot;Improved TOW Vehicle&quot; and the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[NM142]], both on an [[M113]] chassis, several [[Soviet]] ATGM launchers based on the [[BRDM]] reconnaissance car, and the [[Germany|German]] [[Raketenjagdpanzer]] series built on the chassis of the [[HS 30]] and [[Marder (IFV)|Marder]] IFV.

A [[United States Army|US Army]] mechanized infantry battalion has four infantry companies with TOW missile–armed [[M2 Bradley |Bradley IFVs]] and can bring a large concentration of accurate and lethal fire to bear on an attacking enemy unit that uses AFVs.

Some gun-armed tank destroyers continue to be used.  The German army had specialized [[Kanonenjagdpanzer]], similar in design to the WWII tank destroyers, from the mid-1960s until the 1980s.  [[China]] has developed the [[PTL02]] tank destroyer. This wheeled assault tank destroyer armed with a 100mm rifled gun was developed by NORINCO for the PLA new light (rapid reaction) mechanised infantry divisions. The vehicle has a three-man turret derived from the [[Type 96  |Type 88]] MBT, and a 6×6 wheeled chassis based on the [[WZ551]] APC.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''armored car''' ( or '''armoured car''' in [[British English]]) is one of several types of wheeled armoured vehicles: a civilian bullet-proof limousine, a military wheeled armored vehicle, or a special-purpose armored vehicle, for example for transporting valuables.

==Military armoured cars==

A military '''armoured car''' is a type of [[armoured fighting vehicle]] having [[wheel]]s (from four to eight large off-road wheels) instead of [[Caterpillar track|tracks]], and usually light [[vehicle armour|armor]]. Armoured cars are typically inexpensive and have superior speed and range compared to more heavily armoured military vehicles.  Their normal use is for [[reconnaissance]], command, control, and communications (liaison between forward units). They may have a [[machine gun]], an [[autocannon]], a small gun, or may even be unarmed.

At the beginning of the twentieth century a number of military armoured vehicles were manufactured by adding armour and weapons to existing vehicles: [[tractor|armoured tractors]], armoured cars, and [[armoured train]]s are known.  Most of the early designs were a large car chassis to which an body made of steel plates had been added.  A spectacularly impractical early armoured ‘car’ was the [[Russia]]n [[Tsar Tank]] of 1915, a sort of tricycle with nine-metre wheels.

Armoured cars have their use in peacekeeping or internal security duties where their appearance is less confrontational or threatening than tanks, their size and mobility fits better with an urban environment with good roads.

==Civilian armoured cars==
Civilian '''armoured cars''' are modified versions of normal cars, made by replacing the windows with [[bulletproof glass]] and inserting layers of armour under the outer skin of the car, a labor-intensive process that takes a few weeks and costs about $100,000 in the U.S. There is typically no apparent external difference between a non-armoured and armoured version of the same car, in order to not look conspicuous. In most cases [[aramid]] [[composite material|composite]] and ballistic [[steel]] plates are used and the increased mass is offset by a souped-up engine and brakes, as [[composite armour]] is considerably more expensive. The cars may also be equipped for their role: with a [[fire extinguisher]], rims in the wheels allowing to drive on empty tires for typically 15 to 50 km, an explosion-resistant fuel tank, remote starting of the car, pressure and temperature control of the tires, a siren or alarm, and an intercom between the exterior and interior of the car. Sometimes they can also be sealed air-tight from inside, and carry an oxygen bottle, to protect against gas attacks (tear gas, etc).

Armoured cars are in common use by people who feel at risk and can afford them, for example politicians, enterpreneurs, ambassadors, or in higher-risk areas including Colombia, Iraq, Moscow, and Washington DC. They are very popular in [[Mexico City]] due to the level of violence there. Armoured cars can also help protect the passengers in a [[car accident]].

Civilian armoured cars can be divided into two types:

# [[automobile|cars]] or [[truck]]s used in [[transport]]ing valuables, such as large quantities of money which are armored and equipped to resist attempts at [[highway]] [[robbery]] or the [[hijacking]] of the cargo. They may be manned with armed guards but do not mount weapons. Armoured cars are usually operated by [[security]] firms, which provide secure transport for clients' property.
# Armoured versions of cars or [[Sport utility vehicle|SUVs]] used as protection from crime or violence either by individuals who fear they may become victims, or in high risk environments. Diplomatic missions typically use armoured cars as standard vehicles, and many manufacturers or after market firms offer armoured versions of their vehicles. They are typically indistinguishable from the regular version on casual inspection from a distance.

A '''self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon''' (SPAA, also ''self-propelled air defense'', SPAD) is an [[anti-aircraft]] gun or missile mounted on a vehicle [[chassis]].  

Specific weapon systems include [[machine gun]]s, [[autocannon]], larger guns, or [[missile]]s, and some mount both guns and longer-ranged missiles.  The vehicle mount may be based on a [[truck]].  Weapons meant for deployment in the forward battle area may be mounted on [[armoured fighting vehicles]], such as an [[armoured personnel carrier|APC]] or [[tank]], for protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire.  

Anti-aircraft guns are usually mounted in a quickly-traversing [[turret]] with a high range of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft.  They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire.  The concept was pioneered mainly by [[Germany]] during [[World War II]], with their [[flakpanzer]] series.  Today, [[missile]]s have largely replaced medium and heavy antiaircraft guns.

The [[Russian language|Russian]] equivalent of ''SPAAG'' is ''ZSU'', for ''zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka'', (&quot;anti-aircraft self-propelled mount&quot;).

German WWII self-propelled anti-aircraft guns include [[Möbelwagen]], [[Wirbelwind]], [[Ostwind]], [[Kugelblitz]], ''Coelian''.  Modern weapons include the [[Russia|Russian]] [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], [[China|Chinese]] [[Type 88 SPAAG]], [[United States|American]] [[M163 VADS]], German [[Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard|Gepard]] and similar versions with the British Marksman turret (which was also adapted for a number of other users), [[Italy|Italian]] [[SIDAM-25]] and [[Otomatic]] and versions of the [[France|French]] [[AMX-13]]. Older post-war examples include the [[ZSU-57-2]], the failed [[M247 Sergeant York]], [[M16 Quad Fifty]] and [[M42 40 mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun|M42 Duster]].

Other examples include:
* [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], Soviet Union
* [[Gepard]], Germany
* [[PZA Loara]], Poland

'''AZ Alkmaar''' is a [[Football (soccer)|football]] club from [[Alkmaar]], [[the Netherlands]]. It was founded on [[May 10]], [[1967]] as '''AZ '67''', the result of a merger of ''Alkmaar '54'' and ''FC Zaanstreek''. In the Netherlands the club is known as just ''AZ'', but in Europe ''Alkmaar'' is often added. However, very few people outside the Netherlands know the meaning of AZ and it might be better to call the club ''Alkmaar Zaanstreek'' and not ''AZ Alkmaar''.

Owing to the commitment of businessmen Cees and Klaas Molenaar, AZ '67 was successful in the late seventies and early eighties. In 1981 they became Dutch champions and UEFA Cup finalists. After the Molenaar brothers left the club, things went downhill. In 1988 AZ were relegated from the &quot;Eredivisie&quot; (Dutch premier league).

The involvement of businessman [[Dick Scheringa]] in the late nineties marked the revival of the club. AZ returned to the Eredivisie in 1998. In 2004-05 they reappeared in the UEFA Cup tournament, advancing to the semifinals. They also finished third in the Eredivisie that season, again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, after spending most of the season in the top two spots. That is a remarkable achievement, since AZ is not a very big club and it does not have a very large fanbase, even by Dutch standards. AZ's home ground is the [[Alkmaarder Hout]] which has a spectator capacity of 8390. AZ is the only club in the Dutch top flight that does not yet play in a new or renovated stadium. The Alkmaarderhout is an old but very romantic stadium and a reminder of times long gone. It is however not appropiate for a club that has managed to become a force to be reckoned with in recent years, both in the Netherlands and in Europe. The average attendance in 2004/05 was 8,300, but in the summer of 2006 the club will finally move to a new 13,500 (or 16,000) capacity stadium which, due to a much larger demand than expected, will probably be expanded to 30,000 in 2008 by adding a second tier.

The club manager is [[Louis van Gaal]], who succeeded [[Co Adriaanse]] after the 2004-05 season. One of the starting eleven of the team were locally born in [[Alkmaar]]. This season the team is performing very well, and some people even think they might reach the [[Champions League]] next season.
