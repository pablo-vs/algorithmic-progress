==Conflicts with the Roman Empire==
The Alamanni were continually engaged in conflicts with the [[Roman Empire]]. They launched a major invasion of Gaul and northern [[Italy]] in [[268]], when the Romans were forced to denude much of their German frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion of the [[Goths]]. Their depredations in the three parts of Gaul remained traumatic: [[Gregory of Tours]] (died ca 594) mentions their destructive force at the time of [[Gallienus|Valerian and Gallienus]] (253&amp;ndash;260), when the Alemanni assembled under their &quot;king&quot;, whom he calls [[Chrocus]], &quot;by the advice, it is said, of his wicked mother, and overran the whole of the Gauls, and destroyed from their foundations all the temples which had been built in ancient times. And coming to [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]] he set on fire, overthrew and destroyed that shrine which they call ''Vasso Galatae'' in the Gallic tongue,&quot; martyring many Christians ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.html#book3 ''Historia Francorum'' Book I.32&amp;ndash;34]). Thus [[6th century]] Gallo-Romans of Gregory's class, surrounded by the ruins of [[Roman temple]]s and public buildings, attributed the destruction they saw to the plundering raids of the Alemanni.

In the early summer of 268, the [[Roman Emperors|Emperor]] [[Gallienus]] halted their advance in Italy, but then had to deal with the Goths. When the Gothic campaign ended in Roman victory at the [[Battle of Naissus]] in September, Gallienus' successor [[Claudius II|Claudius II Gothicus]] turned north to deal with the Alamanni, who were swarming over all Italy north of the [[Po River]].

After efforts to secure a peaceful withdrawal failed, Claudius forced the Alamanni to battle at the [[Battle of Lake Benacus]] in November. The Alamanni were routed, forced back into Germany, and did not threaten Roman territory for many years afterwards.

Their most famous battle against Rome took place in Argentoratum ([[Strasbourg]]), in [[357]], where they were defeated by [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], later Emperor of Rome, and their king Chnodomar (&quot;[[Chonodomarius]]&quot;) was taken prisoner. 

On [[January 2]], [[366]] the Alamanni crossed the frozen [[Rhine]] in large numbers, to invade the Gallic provinces. 

In the great mixed invasion of [[406]], the Alamanni appear to have crossed the [[Rhine|Rhine river]], conquered and then settled what is today [[Alsace]] and a large part of [[Switzerland]]. [[Fredegar]]'s Chronicle gives an account. At ''Alba Augusta'' ([[Aps]]) the devastation was so complete, that the Christian bishopric was removed to [[Viviers]], but Gregory's account that at Mende in [[Lozère]], also deep in the heart of Gaul, bishop Privatus was forced to sacrifice to idols in the very cave where he was later venerated may be a generic literary trope epitomizing the horrors of barbarian violence.

==Alamanni and Franks==
{{main|Alamannia}}
The kingdom (or duchy) of [[Alamannia]] between Strasbourg and Augsburg lasted until [[496]], when the Alamanni were conquered by [[Clovis I]] at the [[Battle of Tolbiac]]. The war of Clovis with the Alamanni forms the setting for the conversion of Clovis, briefly treated by [[Gregory of Tours]] ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/gregory-clovisconv.html#n30 Book II.31]) Subsequently the Alamanni formed part of the [[Franks|Frankish]] dominions and were governed by a Frankish duke.

In 746, [[Carloman%2C_son_of_Charles_Martel|Carloman]] ended an uprising by summarily executing all Alemannic nobility at the [[blood court at Cannstatt]], and for the following century, Alamannia was ruled by Frankish dukes. Following the [[treaty of Verdun]] of [[843]], Alamannia became a province of the eastern kingdom of [[Louis the German]], the precursor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The duchy persisted until [[1268]].

==Christianization==
[[Christianization]] of the Alamanni took place during [[Merovingian]] times (6th to 8th centuries). Sources are sparse, but in the mid-6th century, the Byzantine chronicler [[Agathias of Myrina]] records, in the context of the wars of the Goths and Franks against Byzantium, that the Alamanni fighting among the troops of Frankish king [[Theudebald]] were like the Franks in all respects except religion, since they
:&quot;worship trees, rivers, hills and gorges as gods, and decapitate horses and cows, and innumerable other animals, as if it were a holy rite,&quot;
also adding the particular ruthlessness of the Alamani in destroying Christian sanctuaries and plundering churches while the genuine Franks were respectful towards those sanctuaries. Agathias expresses his hope that the Alamanni would assume better manners through prolongued contact with the Franks, which is by all appearances what eventually happened.

Apostles of the Alamanni were [[Saint Columbanus]] and his disciple [[Saint Gall]]. [[Jonas of Bobbio]] records that Columbanus was active in [[Bregenz]], where he disrupted a beer sacrifice to [[Wodan]]. For some time, the Alamanni seem to have continued their pagan cult activities, with only superficial or [[Syncretism|syncretistic]] Christian elements. In particular, there is no change in burial practice, and tumulus warrior graves continued to be erected throughout Merovingian times. Syncretism of traditional Germanic [[theriomorph|animal-style]] with Christian symbolism is also present in artwork, but Christian symbolism becomes more and more prevalent during the 7th century. Unlike the later Christianization of the Saxon and of the Slavs, the Alamanni seem to have adopted Christianity gradually, and voluntarily, spread by emulation of the Merovingian elite. 

From ca. the 520s to the 620s, there was a surge of Alamannic [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions. About 80 specimens have survived, roughly half of them on [[fibula]]e, others on belt buckles (see [[Pforzen buckle]]) and other jewellry and weapon parts. Use of runes subsides with the advance of Christianity.

The establishment of the bishopric of [[Constance]] cannot be dated exactly and was possibly undertaken by Columbanus himself (before 612). In any case, it existed by [[635]], when [[Gunzo]] appointed [[John of Grab]] bishop. Constance was a missionary bishopric in newly converted lands, and did not look back on late Roman church history (unlike [[Basel]], episcopal seat from [[740]], which continued the line of Bishops of [[Augusta Raurica]], see [[Bishop of Basel]], and the Raetian bishopric of [[Chur]], established [[451]]). The establishment of the church as an institution recognized by worldly rulers is also visible in legal history. The early 7th century ''[[Pactus Alamannorum]]'' marginally mentions special privileges of the church, while [[Lantfrid]]'s ''[[Lex Alamannorum]]'' of [[720]] has an entire chapter reserved for ecclesial matters.

==Modern Alemanni==
''Allemania'' lost its distinct jurisdictional identity when [[Charles Martel]] absorbed it into the Frankish empire, early in the 8th century. Today, ''Alemannic'' is a linguistic term, referring to [[Alemannic German]], encompassing the dialects of the southern two thirds of [[Baden-Württemberg]] (German State), in western [[Bavaria]] (German State), in [[Vorarlberg]] (Austrian State), [[Swiss German]] in Switzerland and the [[Alsatian language]] of the [[Alsace]] (France).

The word &quot;Frankish&quot; eventually gave its name to [[France]] and [[Franconia]], while the Alamanni gave their name for &quot;German&quot; in French (''Allemand''), Spanish (''Alemán'') and Portuguese (''Alemão'').

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''American Stock Exchange''' ('''AMEX''') is a [[stock exchange]] operated by American Stock Exchange LLC, a subsidiary of the [[NASD]], in the [[United States|United States of America]].

[[Image:AMEX.jpg|250px|thumb|right|American Stock Exchange]]

The Exchange traces its roots back to [[colonial]] times when [[stock broker]]s created outdoor markets to trade new government [[security (finance)|securities]]. The AMEX started out as such a market at the curbstone on Broad Street near Exchange Place. The curb brokers gathered around the lamp posts and mail boxes, resisting wind and weather, putting up lists of [[stock]]s for sale. As trading activity increased, the shouting reached such a high level that special hand signals had to be introduced so that the brokers could continue trading. In [[1921]] the market was moved indoors into the building where it still resides, and the hand signals remained in place for decades even after the move.

In 1998, the American Stock Exchange merged with the National Association of Securities Dealers (operators of [[NASDAQ]]) to create &quot;The Nasdaq-Amex Market Group&quot; where AMEX is an independent entity of the NASD parent company.

Out of the three major American stock exchanges, the AMEX is known to have the most liberal policies concerning company listing, as most of its companies are generally smaller compared to the NYSE and NASDAQ. The Amex also specialises in the trading of ETFs, and hybrid/structured securities. Located next to the [[World Trade Center]], it was tragically affected by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], but has recovered well since then.

==Emergence of the Commonwealth of Australia==
''Main article:'' [[Federation of Australia|Australian federation]]

After European settlement in 1788, [[Australia]] was politically organized as a number of separate British [[colonies]], eventually six in all. By the middle of the nineteenth century, these had achieved virtually complete internal self-government under their own colonial Parliaments, with the &quot;mother country&quot; looking after their defence and such foreign relations as they had, and making only the occasional more direct intervention in their affairs. (These arrangements were confirmed by the Colonial Laws Validity Act of 1865.) One result of this was that they each had their own laws, and applied customs duties at the borders between them, which was a significant impediment to Australia's overall economic development.

Following the formation of the [[Australasian Federal Council|Federal Council of Australasia]] in 1885 (a weak non-executive, non-legislative federation of Western Australia, Fiji, Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria) the movement for full Federation developed in the late nineteenth century, proposing that the six colonies join together as one federation of several States and territories (it was envisaged that New Zealand might join). In the 1890s, two [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|constitutional conventions]] were called, which ultimately adopted a constitution based on a combination of British, American and other models (monarchy and parliamentary government from Britain, federalism from the United States, the use of the referendum from Switzerland). This constitution was then approved by the voters in each of the six colonies. (At the time women had the vote in only one of them: South Australia, and Aboriginal Australians in South Australia and Queensland only). It was then passed (with an amendment allowing for some appeals to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] in London) as an Act of the British Parliament: the [[Constitution of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act]] 1900. The Act entered into force on [[January 1]] [[1901]], at which point the Commonwealth of Australia came into being.

==The Commonwealth is born==

The establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia is commonly taken as the date of Australia's independence from the [[United Kingdom]], but matters are more complicated than that. The Constitution provided the Commonwealth with all the powers associated with a sovereign state, including the power to engage in foreign affairs and to raise its own army. But the United Kingdom still retained the power to engage in foreign affairs on behalf of Australia, and to make laws for it. In the early years Australia continued to be represented by the United Kingdom as part of the British Empire at international conferences.

Also, the Constitution provided that the British monarch be represented in Australia by a Governor-General, who was originally appointed on the advice of the British, not the Australian, government, and was generally a British aristocrat. Finally, the Constitution provided that any law of the Australian Parliament could be disallowed within a year by the British monarch (acting on the advice of British ministers), though this power was never in fact exercised. In summary, the constitutional position of the Commonwealth as a whole in relation to the United Kingdom was, originally, the same as that of the individual colonies before Federation.

==From a united empire crown to a shared monarch==

A fundamental change in the constitutional structures of the British Commonwealth (formerly the British Empire, and not to be confused with the Commonwealth of Australia) did occur, however, in the late [[1920s]]. Under the British [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]], which implemented a decision of an earlier Commonwealth conference, the unified Crown that had heretofore been the centre point of the Empire was replaced by multiple crowns worn by a ''shared monarch''. Before 1927, King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] reigned as king ''in'' Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], the [[Irish Free State]], [[South Africa]], etc., each of these states, in effect, as dominions, amounting to a subset of the United Kingdom. After 1927, he reigned as King ''of'' Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, etc.  The form of use in the royal title as issued by King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/britstyles.htm#1927] did not mention the dominions by name, except 'Ireland', which changed from being referred to as ''Great Britain and Ireland'' to ''Great Britain, Ireland'', indicating that it was no longer part of the United Kingdom, but a separate state of which the monarch was now directly the head, rather than through linkage with Great Britain. Though unnamed, except through reference to the 'British Dominions beyond the Seas', the ground-breaking move shattered the previous concept of the shared monarch to one of multiple monarchies, all held by the one monarch. 

Though this principle was implicit in the Act and in the King's new titles, and came out of a Commonwealth Conference, neither the British government nor the dominion governments seemed initially to grasp its significance. So while the Irish ''immediately'' put the principle into effect by assuming the right to select their own governor-general and to demand a direct right of audience with the King (excluding British ministers), other dominions were much slower to go down this path, and when they did so, they were faced with determined, though ultimately futile, attempts to block such evolution in London. 

Whereas before 1927, it was correct in law to talk about the ''British monarch'' reigning in the dominions, after 1927, there was technically a 'King of Australia', etc., even if that title was never used formally, with the only link being that that monarch ''was'' British and resident outside the Commonwealth of Australia. Curiously, while the Irish asserted the title '[[King of Ireland]]' by having King George V sign an international treaty on behalf of his Irish realm as early as 1931 (where he was formally advised by the Irish Minister for External Affairs who formally 'attended' His Majesty, with no British minister present), the formal title 'Queen of Australia' was only adopted through the ''Royal Style and Titles Act'' [http://www.statusquo.org/royalstyle.html] enacted by the Parliament of Australia in 1973.

==The Statute of Westminster==

The next major constitutional change came about with the Act of the British Parliament known as the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] of [[1931]]. This was associated with the transformation of the British Empire into the British Commonwealth. The UK government recognized Australia (and its other dominions, such as Canada and New Zealand) as independent, and agreed that the British Government and Parliament would only make laws for them if they specifically requested it, with the various dominions having the legal right to adopt and amend past legislation enacted in Westminster. (This allowed the Irish Free State, for example, to remove the requirement that the then Irish constitution be limited by the contents of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. Once that was removed, the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]], appeals to the Privy Council, Senate, [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|governor-generalship]] and [[The Crown|Crown]] were all abolished.) 

However, for various reasons, the Statute of Westminster did ''not'' apply to the Australian States (at their own request), so that they remained, in relation to the United Kingdom, in the position of substantially self-governing colonies, subject, in theory at least, to any legislation specifically directed at them by the British Parliament. Also, their Governors, representing the monarch, were formally appointed on the advice of British ministers, though these increasingly merely relayed advice given to them by the Australian State Premiers.

On the other hand, at the Commonwealth level, the practice was established that the Governor-General was to be appointed by the monarch on the advice of Australian, not British ministers, when the Australian government successfully insisted, against considerable British opposition (including from the King himself), on the appointment of the native-born Sir Isaac Isaacs as Governor-General in 1931.

In April [[1933]], a [[referendum]] in [[Western Australia]] produced a 68% yes vote to leave the Commonwealth of Australia with the aim of returning to the [[British Empire]] as an autonomous territory.  No action was taken in the British Parliament because no request was received from the Australian Government in line with the Statute of Westminster.

==The Australia Act==

The power under the Statute of Westminster to request the British Parliament to make laws for Australia was used on several occasions, primarily in order to enable Australia to acquire new territories. But its most significant use was also its last. This was when the procedure was used to pass the [[Australia Act 1986|Australia Act]] 1986. The Australia Act effectively terminated the ability of the British Parliament or Government to make laws for Australia or its States, even at their request; and provided that any law which was previously required to be passed by the British Parliament on behalf of Australia could now be passed by Australia and its States by themselves. It also removed the right of the monarch personally (that is, not through the local Governor) to exercise his or her powers in the states, except when personally present in them. And it severed the last judicial link with the United Kingdom, by abolishing the right of appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].

==An evolving independence==

Thus the independence of Australia from the United Kingdom, rather than occurring as a single event, has, in legal terms, been a continuing process. Some of the significant milestones discussed above have been the following:

* mid-1800s: acquisition of substantial internal self-government by the colonies
* 1901: establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia
* 1927: development of the &quot;shared&quot; monarchy
* 1931: passing of the Statute of Westminster
* 1986: passing of the Australia Act

Since the Australia Act, the only remaining constitutional link with the United Kingdom (if it is one) is in the person of the monarch (see [[Queen of Australia]]). But even that connection may not be automatic. In an important constitutional case (''Sue v Hill'' (1999) 163 ALR 648), three justices of the [[High Court of Australia]] (the ultimate court of appeal) expressed the view that if the British Parliament were to alter the law of succession to the throne, such a change could ''not'' have any effect on the monarchy in Australia, because of the Australia Act: succession to the throne would continue in Australia according to the existing rule, unless and until that was altered ''in Australia''. None of the other four justices in that case disagreed with this reasoning. (Because it was not strictly necessary to decide the case at hand, this is not strictly a binding judicial determination; but it is almost certainly correct given the [[precedent]] of the [[Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII|Abdication Crisis of 1936]].)  

The same case decided (and on this point the decision ''is'' binding) that the United Kingdom is a &quot;foreign power&quot; within the meaning of the Constitution, and therefore that holders of British citizenship are ineligible for election to the Federal Parliament (though a special &quot;grandfathering&quot; arrangement merely phases out the right of British citizens to vote).

==Crisis in 1975==
The elections of the [[Australian Labor Party]] in [[1972]] and [[1974]] under its leader [[Gough Whitlam]] led to several constitutional issues being tested.  For two weeks in 1972, the Government had only two ministers, Whitlam and [[Lance Barnard]].  Although it had a majority in the lower House, the ALP faced a hostile Senate, and the defeat of Government bills led to a double dissolution and a consequent [[Joint Sitting, Australian parliament, 1974|joint sitting]] and the passing of the bills into law as allowed under section 57. The political situation however was not improved much by the 1974 election, and the Senate later failed to provide &quot;supply&quot; (i.e. to pass tax and expenditure acts).  The resulting [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975]] raised a series of issues: 
* Must a State Governor appoint a party's nomination as a replacement in the Senate? 
* Can the Senate refuse supply or refuse to discuss supply? 
* Should the Prime Minister resign in such a situation? 
* If he does not, should the Governor-General dismiss him?
* How can the Governor-General and Prime Minister have a sensible discussion when each is able to have the other dismissed immediately provided that the other has not already acted?        

Of these, only the first has been partly resolved; an amendment in 1977 changed the procedure for casual appointment.  while the State Parliaments can still require a state Governor to appoint somebody who is not the party's nominee, by stripping that nominee of their party membership the party can deny them appointment to the Senate.  The State parliament can still refuse to appoint the party's nominee; in this case, a standoff can develop where the vacancy goes unfilled.  This occurred in 1987, when the Tasmanian state parliament refused to appoint the Labor Party's nominee for a casual vacancy ([http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/2001-02/02rp18.pdf], reference 99).

==Towards an Australian republic?==
As already seen, the only remaining constitutional connection with the United Kingdom is through the monarch, who is the monarch not only of the UK, but also of Australia and of each of its States. The main function of the monarch is to appoint and dismiss the Governor-General and the State Governors, and this function is exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or the relevant State Premier. (The monarch is also sometimes asked to perform some function, such as giving the Royal Assent to an Act of Parliament, for ceremonial purposes during a Royal visit.)

On recent moves to replace the current constitution with a republic, and the defeat of the referendum for this purpose in 1999, see [[Australian republicanism]].

:''for the [[Cornwall|Cornish]] painter see [[Alfred Wallis]]''
'''Alfred Russel Wallace,''' [[Order of Merit|OM]] , [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ([[January 8]] [[1823]] &amp;ndash; [[November 7]] [[1913]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Natural history|naturalist]], [[geographer]], [[anthropologist]] and [[biologist]].  Wallace's independent proposal of a theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] prompted [[Charles Darwin]] to reveal his own more developed and researched, but unpublished, theory sooner than he had intended.  He is sometimes called the &quot;[[List of people known as father or mother of something#W|father of biogeography]]&quot;.

==Early life==

Wallace was born at [[Usk]], [[Monmouthshire]]. He was the eighth of nine children of Thomas Vere Wallace and Mary Anne Greenell. He attended grammar school in [[Hertford]], but left when his family lost their remaining property. He worked for his older brother William in his surveying business, and between [[1840]] and [[1843]] spent his time surveying in the west of [[England]] and [[Wales]]. In [[1844]] he was hired as a master at the Collegiate School in [[Leicester]]. In [[1845]] his brother William died and Wallace returned to run the [[surveying]] business.

[[Image:Alfred Russel Wallace 1862 - Project Gutenberg eText 15997.png|thumbnail|right|200px|A. R. Wallace in [[Singapore]] in [[1862]]]]
==Exploration and study of the natural world==

In [[1848]], Wallace, together with another naturalist, [[Henry Walter Bates]] (whom he had met in [[Leicester]]), left for [[Brazil]] to collect specimens in the [[Amazon Rainforest]], with the express intention of gathering facts in order to solve the riddle of the origin of species.  Unfortunately, a large part of his collection was destroyed when his ship caught fire and sank while returning to Britain in [[1852]].

From [[1854]] to [[1862]], he travelled through the [[Malay Archipelago]] or [[East Indies]] (now [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]), to collect specimens and study nature. His observations of the marked zoological differences across a narrow zone in the archipelago led to his hypothesis of the zoogeographical boundary now known as the [[Wallace line]]. One of his better known species descriptions during this trip is the gliding tree [[frog]] ''Rhacophorus nigropalmatus'', Wallace's flying frogs.  His studies there were eventually published in [[1869]] as ''The Malay Archipelago''.

==Theory of evolution==

: See also [[Publication of Darwin's theory]].

In [[1855]], Wallace published a paper, [http://www.wku.edu/%7Esmithch/wallace/S020.htm &quot;On the Law Which has Regulated the Introduction of Species&quot; (1855)], in which he gathers and enumerates general observations regarding the geographic and geologic distribution of species ([[biogeography]]), and concludes that &quot;Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species.&quot;  The paper was a foreshadowing of the momentous paper he would write three years hence.

Wallace had once briefly met Darwin, and was one of Darwin's numerous correspondents from around the world, whose observations Darwin used to support his theories.  Wallace knew that Darwin was interested in the question of how species originate, and trusted his opinion on the matter.  Thus, he sent him his essay, [http://www.wku.edu/%7Esmithch/wallace/S043.htm &quot;On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type&quot; (1858)], and asked him to review it. On [[18 June]] [[1858]] Darwin received the manuscript from Wallace. In it, Wallace described a novel theory of what is now known as &quot;natural selection,&quot; and he proposed that it explains the diversity of life.  It was essentially the same as the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years, but had yet to publish.  Darwin wrote in a letter to [[Charles Lyell]]: &quot;he could not have made a better short abstract!  Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters!&quot;  Although Wallace had not requested that his essay be published, Charles Lyell and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] decided to present the essay, together with excerpts from a paper that Darwin had written in [[1844]], and kept confidential, to the [[Linnean Society of London]] on [[1 July]] [[1858]], highlighting Darwin's priority. 

Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, grateful that he had been included at all. Darwin's social and scientific status was at that time far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken as seriously. Though relegated to the position of co-discoverer, and never the social equal of Darwin or the other elite British natural scientists, Wallace was granted far greater access to tightly-regulated British scientific circles after the advocacy on his part by Darwin. When he returned to England, Wallace met Darwin and the two remained friendly afterwards.

==Religious views, and application of the theory to mankind==

In a letter to a relative in [[1861]], Wallace wrote: &quot;I think I have fairly heard and fairly weighed the evidence on both sides, and I remain an utter disbeliever in almost all that you consider the most sacred truths...  I can see much to admire in all religions... But whether there be a God and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal soul or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can have no fear of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth....&quot;

In [[1864]], before Darwin had publicly addressed the subject&amp;mdash;though others had&amp;mdash;Wallace published a paper, ''The Origin of Human Races and the Antiquity of Man Deduced from the Theory of 'Natural Selection''', applying the theory to mankind.  Wallace subsequently became a [[spiritualism|spiritualist]], and later maintained that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humor; and that something in &quot;the unseen universe of Spirit&quot; had interceded at least three times in history: 1. The creation of life from inorganic matter. 2. The introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. 3. The generation of the above-mentioned faculties in mankind.  He also believed that the raison d'être of the universe was the development of the human spirit.  (See Wallace (1889)). These views greatly disturbed Darwin in his lifetime, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that [[sexual selection]] could easily explain such apparently non-adaptive phenomena. 

In many accounts of the history of evolution, Wallace is relegated to a role of simply being the &quot;stimulus&quot; to Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a chief thinker on evolution in his day whose ideas could not be ignored. He is among the most cited naturalists in Darwin's ''[[Descent of Man]]'', often in strong disagreement.

==Precursor of ecology, and awards==
Wallace was the first to propose a [[biogeography|&quot;geography&quot;]] of animal species, and as such is considered one of the [[ecology#The_notion_of_biocenose:_Darwin_and_Wallace|precursors of ecology]] and [[biogeography|biogeography]].

==Awards==
Among the many awards presented to Wallace were the [[Order of Merit]] ([[1908]]), the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Copley Medal]] ([[1908]]), the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s Founder's Medal ([[1892]]) and the Linnean Society's Gold Medal ([[1892]]).

He is also honored by having [[Impact crater|crater]]s on [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and the [[Moon]] named after him.  Having sometimes been referred to as &quot;Darwin's Moon&quot; it is amusing that Wallace has a crater on the Moon named after himself.

The '''Australian Labor Party''' or '''ALP''' is [[Australia]]'s oldest [[political party]]. It is so-named because of its origins in and close links to the [[labor union|trade union]] movement. While it is standard practice in [[Australian English]] to spell the word ''[[Wiktionary:labour|labour]]'' with an &quot;-our&quot; ending, the name of the party ends with &quot;-or&quot;.

==Policy==
Like other [[social democratic]] parties, Labor tends to believe that government is generally a positive force in the community and that it is the responsibility of governments to intervene in the operation of the economy (and society in general) to improve outcomes. Labor believes that the government should ensure that all members of society receive a basic income in order to have a &quot;decent quality of life&quot;. Labor also believes that the government should ensure that all members of society are able to access quality and affordable housing as well as education and health services [http://www.alp.org.au/about/values.php]. 

Taking these objectives into account, like most social democratic parties around the world, Labor has embraced more free market principles since the beginning of the [[1980s]]. For example, Labor supports and implemented the dismantling of trade barriers and deregulation of industry. However, the party argues that it made these changes more moderately and with greater concern for those made worse off from these changes than the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] would have. Labor's policy shift has had critics from both the [[Left-wing politics|left]] and the [[Right-wing politics|right]] of the political spectrum. The left says that Labor has abandoned its traditional base and values and that its policies are indistinguishable from those of the Coalition. The right argues that Labor doesn't embrace enough neo-liberal economics and that it is sticking to a tired, union-dominated ideology. 

Since the 1970s and 1980s Labor has supported [[multiculturalism]] and generally is more likely to approve of higher immigration levels than the Coalition. Labor is the primary supporter of issues that affect [[indigenous Australians]] such as land rights and supports a formal apology on the issue of the [[stolen generation]]. Labor is also more likely to support additional rights for gay and lesbian people and it is a stronger supporter of equal opportunity legislation than the Coalition. Labor MPs are more likely to support [[pro-choice]] positions on [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]], but the party almost always provides MPs with a [[conscience vote]] on these matters. Many MPs use this option to take a [[pro-life]] position, and the ALP has traditionally had a &quot;Catholic Right&quot; element (since Roman Catholics in Australia were traditionally working-class and thus inclined to support Labor) which continues to defend socially conservative positions on the family, abortion, euthanasia and homosexuality; however, its influence has declined somewhat. Many of the more socially liberal positions which often characterise the party today reflect the transformation of the ALP begun in the late 1960s and early 1970s under [[Gough Whitlam]] from a party dominated by the socially conservative working class to a party drawing a large slab of support from the new socially liberal middle class. 

Internationally, Labor generally believes in [[multilateralism]], but is often more critical of Australia's relationship with large international powers like the [[United States]] and historically the [[United Kingdom]] than the Liberal Party. However, many members of the Labor Party, especially those affiliated with right-wing factions, are strong supporters of the alliance with the United States. This support is also official party policy. However, Labor opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] (though it did support the [[2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]). In his welcome speech to [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George W. Bush]], former leader [[Simon Crean]] said:

:''The Australian perspective is bound to differ, from time to time, with the perspective of the United States. Of course, on occasions, friends disagree, as we on this side did with you on the war in Iraq. But, such is the strength of our shared values, interests and principles, those differences can enrich rather than diminish, strengthen rather than weaken, our partnership. Our commitment to the Alliance remains unshakeable, as does our commitment to the [[War on Terror]], but friends must be honest with each other.''[http://www.australianpolitics.com/news/2003/10/03-10-23b.shtml]

Labor also supports a greater level of Australian integration with Asia than the Liberal Party, but this distinction is starting to narrow with increasing Liberal Party support for stronger Asian relationships, especially with [[Indonesia]].

==Structure==
The Australian Labor Party is a democratic and federal party, which consists of both individual members and affiliated trade unions, who between them decide the party's policies, elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office. The great majority of trade unions in Australia are affiliated to the party, and their affiliation fees, based on the size of their memberships, makes up a large part of the party's income. The party consists of six state and two territory branches, each of which consists of local branches which any Australian citizen or permanent resident can join, plus affiliated trade unions. Individual members pay a membership fee, which is graduated according to income. Members are expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year. In practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings. Many members only become active during election campaigns. The party has about 50,000 individual members, although this figure tends to fluctuate along with the party's electoral fortunes.

[[Image:ac.kimbeazleynew.jpg|thumb|300px|Hon Kim Beazley, Leader of the Australian Labor Party 1996-2001 and since 2005]]

The members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences (usually held annually, although more frequent conferences are often held). These conferences decide policy, and elect state or territory executives, a state or territory president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state or territory secretary (a full-time professional position). The larger branches also have full-time assistant secretaries and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches.

The party holds a National Conference every three years, which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches (many coming from affiliated trade unions, although there is no formal requirement for unions to be represented at the National Conference). The National Conference approves the party's Platform and policies, elects the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive]], and appoints office-bearers such as the National Secretary, who also serves as national campaign director during elections. The current National Secretary is [[Tim Gartrell]]. The next National Conference will be held in January [[2007]].

The national Leader of the Labor Party is elected by the Labor members of the national Parliament (the [[Caucus]]), not by the conference. Until recently the national conference elected the party's National President, a largely honorary position, but since [[2003]] the position has rotated among people directly elected by the party's individual members. The current National President is [[Warren Mundine]], who assumed the past in January 2006. The two Vice-Presidents are [[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]], a veteran party figure who was a minister in the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] government, and Dr [[Carmen Lawrence]], a former Premier of Western Australia and minister in the [[Paul Keating|Keating]] government.

The Labor Party contests national, state and territory elections. In some states it also contests local government elections: in others it does not, preferring to allow its members to run as non-endorsed candidates. The process of choosing Labor candidates is called '''pre-selection'''. Candidates are pre-selected by different methods in the various states and territories. In some they are chosen by ballots of all party members, in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference, in still others by a combination of these two. Labor candidates are required to sign a pledge that if elected they will always vote in Parliament in accordance with decisions made by a vote of the Caucus. They are also sometimes required to donate a portion of their salary to the party, although this practice has declined with the introduction of public funding for political parties.

The Labor Party has always had a left wing and a right wing, but since the 1970s it has been organised into formal factions, to which many party members belong and often pay an additional membership fee. The two largest factions are [[Labor Unity]] (on the right) and the [[Socialist Left|National Left]]. Labor Unity generally supports free-market policies and the U.S. Alliance. The National Left, although it seldom openly espouses [[socialism]], favours more state intervention in the economy and is generally opposed to the U.S. Alliance. The factions are themselves divided into sub-factions, and there is a constantly changing pattern of factional and sub-factional alliances around particular policy issues or around particular pre-selection disputes. Frequently these alliances and disputes reflect power struggles between or within trade unions.

The trade unions are also factionally aligned. The largest unions supporting the right are the [[Australian Workers Union]] (AWU), the [[National Union of Workers]] (NUW), the [[Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association]] (SDA). Important unions supporting the left include the [[Australian Manufacturing Workers Union]] (AMWU), the [[Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union]] (LHMU), the [[Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]] (CFMEU), the [[Australian Services Union]] (ASU) and the [[Maritime Union of Australia]] (MUA). But these affiliations are seldom unconditional or permanent. The AWU and the NUW, for example, are bitter rivals and the NUW sometimes aligns itself with the left to further its conflict with the AWU. On some issues, such as opposition to the Howard government's industrial relations policy, all the unions are in agreement and work as a block within the party.

Pre-selections are usually conducted along factional lines, although sometimes a non-factional candidate will be given preferential treatment (this happened with [[Cheryl Kernot]] in [[1998]] and again with [[Peter Garrett]] in [[2004]]). Deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them are also common. Pre-selections, particularly for safe Labor seats, are often bitterly contested, and have frequently involved practices such as '''[[branch stacking]]''' (signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in pre-selection ballots), [[personation]], multiple voting and even fraudulent electoral enrolment. Trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over pre-selections, but party rules changes have stamped out this practice. Pre-selection results are frequently challenged, and the National Executive is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes.

==History==

No exact date can be given for the founding of the Australian Labor Party, originating as it did from the various colonial labour movements. Labour Leagues and similar electoral organisations existed in [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]] from about [[1890]]. Party mythology says the first Labour branch was founded at a meeting of striking pastoral workers under a tree (the &quot;Tree of Knowledge&quot;) in [[Barcaldine, Queensland]] in [[1891]]. The [[Balmain, New South Wales]] branch of the party also claims to be the oldest in Australia. The party as a serious electoral force dates from [[1893]] in Queensland, [[1894]] in New South Wales, and later in the other colonies. In [[1899]], [[Anderson Dawson]] formed a minority Labour government in [[Queensland]], the first in the world, which lasted one week.

After [[Australian Federation|Federation]], the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party (informally known as the [[caucus|Caucus]]) first met on the [[8 May]] [[1901]] at [[Parliament House, Melbourne]], the meeting place of the first Federal Parliament. This is now taken as the founding date of the federal Labor Party, but it was some years before there was any significant structure or organisation at a national level. (The formal name '''Australian Labor Party''' was adopted in [[1908]].)

The ALP during its early years was distinguished by its rapid growth and success at a national level, first forming a minority national government under [[Chris Watson]] in April [[1904]], and forming its first majority government under [[Andrew Fisher]] in [[1910]]. The state branches were also successful, except in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], where the strength of [[Alfred Deakin|Deakinite]] [[liberalism]] inhibited the party's growth. The first majority Labor state governments were formed in [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]] in [[1910]], in [[Western Australia]] in [[1911]] and in [[Queensland]] in [[1915]]. Such success eluded equivalent social democratic and labour parties in other countries for many years.

One of the party's early innovations was the establishment of a federal [[arbitration]] system for the resolution of industrial disputes, which formed the basis of the industrial relations system for many decades. 

The party was historically committed to [[socialist]] economic policies, but this term was never clearly defined, and no Labor government ever attempted to implement &quot;socialism&quot; in any serious sense. Labor supported national wage fixing and a strong welfare system, it did not [[nationalisation|nationalise]] private enterprise. The single exception to this was [[Ben Chifley]]'s attempt to nationalise the private banks in the [[1940s]], but this was ruled unconstitutional by the [[High Court of Australia]]. The commitment to nationalisation was dropped by [[Gough Whitlam]].

In the [[1970s]] and beyond, the party, through the efforts of [[Gough Whitlam]] and his supporters within the party, gave up its theoretical commitment to socialism and became a [[social democrat]]ic party. (Some references to [[democratic socialism]] still remain in the party's constitution, but they are generally regarded as a relic). Indeed, during the [[1980s]] the party was responsible for the introduction of many economic policies such as [[privatization|privatisation]] of government enterprises (such as the [[Commonwealth Bank]], which was itself established by an earlier Labor government), and [[deregulation]] of many previously tightly-controlled industries, which are normally the province of [[conservative]] governments.

From its formation until the 1950s Labor and its affiliated unions were the strongest defenders of the [[White Australia Policy]], which banned all non-European migration to Australia. This policy was partly motivated by 19th-century theories about &quot;racial purity&quot; (shared by most Australians at this time), and partly by fears of economic competition from low-wage labour. In practice the party opposed all migration, on the grounds that immigrants competed with Australian workers and drove down wages, until after [[World War II]], when the [[Ben Chifley|Chifley]] government launched a major immigration program. The party's opposition to non-European immigration did not change until after the retirement of [[Arthur Calwell]] as leader in [[1967]]. Subsequently Labor has become an advocate of [[multiculturalism]], although some of its trade union base continue to oppose high immigration levels.

The Labor Party has suffered three major splits: 

*In [[1915]] over the issue of conscription, when Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] supported the introduction of [[conscription]], while the majority of the party opposed it. After failing to persuade the Australian voters to support a [[referendum]] approving of conscription which bitterly divided the country in the process, Hughes and his followers were expelled from the Labor Party. He formed the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] in alliance with the conservatives and remained Prime Minister until [[1923]]. 

*In [[1931]] over economic issues revolving around how to handle the [[Great_Depression|depression]]. The ALP was split between those who believed in radical policies such as NSW Premier [[Jack Lang (Australia)|Jack Lang]], who wanted to repudiate Australia's debt to British bondholders, proto-[[Keynesian economics|Keynesians]] such as federal Treasurer [[Ted Theodore]], and believers in orthodox finance such as Prime Minister [[James Scullin]] and a senior minister in his government, [[Joseph Lyons]]. In [[1931]] Lyons left the party and joined the conservatives, becoming Prime Minister in [[1932]].

*The [[1954]] split on [[communism]]. During the [[1950s]] the issue of communism and support for communist causes or governments caused great internal conflict in the Labor party and the trade union movement in general. During the 1950's, staunchly [[anti-Communist]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] members (Catholics being an important traditional support base) became suspicious of Communist infiltration of unions and formed Industrial Groups to gain control of them, fostering intense internal conflict. After Labor's loss of the [[1954]] election, federal leader [[H.V. Evatt|Dr H.V. Evatt]] blamed the subversive activities of the &quot;Groupers&quot; for the defeat. They were expelled from the ALP and formed the [[Democratic Labor Party]] (DLP) whose intellectual leader was [[B.A. Santamaria]]. The DLP was heavily influenced by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] social teachings and had the support of the Catholic Archbishop of [[Melbourne]], [[Daniel Mannix]]. The DLP helped the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] remain in power for almost two decades but was successfully undermined by the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Labor Government during the [[1970s]] and ceased to exist as a parliamentary party after the [[1974]] election. 

The Labor Party thus served as a development ground for several conservative leaders. Conservative Prime Ministers [[Joseph Cook]], [[Billy Hughes]] and [[Joseph Lyons]] were all ex-members of the Labor Party, with both Hughes and Lyons holding very senior positions in the party (Prime Minister and Premier respectively). Non-Labor premiers such as [[William Holman]] also began their careers in the Labor Party.

Labor, like parties of the broad centre in most countries, draws criticism from both left and right. Critics from the left say Labor has abandoned its traditional base and values and that its policies are indistinguishable from those of the conservative parties. Right-wing critics accuse Labor of sticking to a tired, union-dominated ideology. Many members of the party are critical of the role of the factions and of union leaders, who they accuse of colluding to stifle party democracy. The party has also been criticised for accepting political donations from real estate interests, particularly in NSW, and for its links to gambling industries.

Through its membership of the [[Socialist International]], the ALP is affiliated with other democratic socialist, social democratic and labour parties in many countries.

The '''Dodo''' is a fictional character appearing in Chapters 2 and 3 of the book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]] (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson). It is a reference to Dodgson himself who had a stutter and very frequently pronounced his name &quot;Do-do-dodgson&quot;.

In this passage Lewis Carroll incorporated references to everyone present on the original boating expedition of [[July 4]], [[1862]] during which Alice's Adventures were first told, with [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] as herself, and the others represented by birds: the [[Lory]] was Lorina Liddell, the [[The Eaglet|Eaglet]] was Edith Liddell, the Dodo was Carroll, and the [[Duck]] was Rev. [[Robinson Duckworth]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Albert''' or '''Albrecht''' ([[March 28]] [[1522]]-[[1557]]), prince of [[Bayreuth]], ([[Germany]]), surnamed '''the Warlike''', and also '''Alcibiades''', was a son of [[Kasimir, Margrave of Bayreuth]], and a member of the [[Franconia|Franconian]] branch of the [[Hohenzollern]] family.  

He was born at [[Ansbach]] and having lost his father in 1527 he came under the guardianship of his uncle George, prince of Ansbach, a strong adherent of [[Protestantism]].  
In 1541 he received Bayreuth as his share of the family lands, and as the chief town of his principality was [[Kulmbach]] he is sometimes referred to as the margrave of 
Brandenburg-Kulmbach.  

His restless and turbulent nature marked him out for a military career; and having collected 
a small band of soldiers, he assisted the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in his war with France in 1543.  
The [[Peace of Crepy]] in September 1544 deprived him of this employment, but he had won 
a considerable reputation, and when Charles was preparing to attack the [[Schmalkaldic League]], he took pains to win Albert's assistance.  
Sharing in the attack on the Saxon electorate, Albert was taken prisoner at [[Rochlitz]] in March 1547 by [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]], but was released as a result of the emperor's victory at the [[Battle of Mühlberg]] in the succeeding April.  

He then followed the fortunes of his friend [[Maurice of Saxony]], deserted Charles, and joined the league which proposed to overthrow the emperor by an alliance with [[Henry II of France]].  He took part in the subsequent campaign, but when the [[Peace of Passau]] was signed in August 1552 he separated himself from his allies and began a crusade of plunder in [[Franconia]].  Having extorted a large sum of money from the citizens of [[Nuremberg]], he quarrelled with his supporter, the French king, and offered his services to the emperor.  Charles, anxious to secure such a famous fighter, gladly assented to Albert's demands and gave the imperial sanction to his possession of the lands taken from the bishops of [[Würzburg]] and [[Bamberg]]; and his conspicuous bravery was of great value to the emperor on the retreat from [[Metz]] in January 1553.  

When Charles left Germany a few weeks later, Albert renewed his depredations in Franconia.  These soon became so serious that a league was formed to crush him, and Maurice of Saxony led an army against his former comrade.  The rival forces met at Sievershausen on [[July 9]] [[1553]], and after a combat of unusual ferocity Albert was put to flight.  
Henry II, duke of Brunswick, then took command of the troops of the league, and after Albert had been placed under the imperial ban in December 1553 he was defeated by Duke Henry, and compelled to flee to France.  
He there entered the service of Henry II of France and had undertaken a campaign to regain 
his lands when he died at [[Pforzheim]] on [[January 8]] [[1557]]. 

He is defined by [[Carlyle]] &quot;a failure of a Fritz,&quot; with &quot;features&quot; of a Frederick the Great in him, &quot;but who burnt away his splendid qualities as a mere temporary shine for the able editors, and never came to anything, full of fire, too much of it wildfire, not in the least like an Alcibiades except in the change of fortune he underwent&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Adalbertus Siegel.JPG|thumb|175px|left|The seal of Albert I]]'''Albert I''' (c. 1100-1170), [[Margrave]] of [[Brandenburg]], also called, '''The Bear''' (Ger: '''Albrecht der Bär'''), was the only son of Otto the Rich, count of [[Ballenstedt]], and [[Eilika of Saxony|Eilika]], daughter of [[Magnus, Duke of Saxony|Magnus Billung]], [[Rulers of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]].  He inherited the valuable estates in northern Saxony of his father in [[1123]], and on his mother's death, in [[1142]], succeeded to one-half of the lands of the house of [[Billung]].  
[[Image:Albrecht gesamt.JPG|thumb|Monument commemorating Albrecht, [[Spandau|Spandau Citadel]], Berlin]]
Albrecht was a loyal [[vassal]] of his relation, [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar I, duke of Saxony]], from whom, about [[1123]], he received the margravate of [[Lusatia]], to the east; after Lothar became king of the Germans, he accompanied him on a disastrous expedition to [[Bohemia]] in [[1126]], when he suffered a short imprisonment.  

Albert's entanglements in Saxony stemmed from his desire to expand his inherited estates there. In [[1128]] his brother-in-law, Henry II, who was margrave of a small area on the Elbe called the Saxon [[Northern March]], died, and Albert, disappointed at not receiving this fief himself, attacked Udo, the heir, and was consequently deprived of Lusatia by Lothar.  In spite of this, he went to [[Italy]] in [[1132]] in the train of the king, and his services there were rewarded in [[1134]] by the investiture of the North Mark, which was again without a ruler.   

Once he was firmly established in the[[ Nordmark]], Albert's covetous eye lay also on the thinly populated lands to the north and east. Three years he was occupied in campaigns against the Slavic [[Wends]], who as pagans were considered fair game, and whose subjugation to Christianity was the aim of the &quot;Wendish crusade&quot; of 1147 in which Albert took part; diplomatic measures were more successful, and by an arrangement made with [[Pribislav]], the last of the Wendish dukes of Brandenburg, Albert secured this district when the duke died in [[1150]]. Taking the title &quot;Margrave of Brandenburg&quot;, he pressed the &quot;crusade&quot; against the Wends, extended the area of his mark, encouraged German migration, established bishoprics under his protection, and so became the founder of the [[Margraviate]] of Brandenburg in [[1157]], which his heirs&amp;mdash;the [[Ascanian]]s&amp;mdash;held until the line died out in 1320. 

In [[1137]] his cousin and nemesis, [[Henry II, Duke of Saxony|Henry the Proud]] was deprived by the Hohenstaufen [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III, King of the Germans]] of his Saxon duchy, which was awarded to Albert, if he could take it. After some initial success in his efforts to take possession, he was driven from Saxony, and also from his Nordmark by Henry, and compelled to take refuge in South Germany. When peace was made with Henry in [[1142]] Albert renounced the Saxon dukedom and received the counties of [[Weimar]] and [[Orlamunde|Orlamünde]].  It was possibly at this time that Albert was made Arch-Chamberlain of the Empire, an office which afterwards gave the Margraves of Brandenburg the rights of a [[prince-elector]]. 

A feud with Henry's son, [[Henry the Lion]], Duke of Saxony, was interrupted, in [[1158]], by a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and in [[1162]] Albert accompanied the Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] to [[Italy]], where he distinguished himself at the storming of [[Milan]].  

In [[1164]] he joined a league of princes formed against Henry the Lion, and peace being made in [[1169]], Albert divided his territories among his six sons, and died on [[November 13]] [[1170]], and was buried at Ballenstedt.

His personal qualities won for him the surname of ''the Bear,'' &quot;not from his looks or qualities, for he was a tall handsome man, but from the cognisance on his shield, an able man, had a quick eye as well as a strong hand, and could pick what way was straightest among crooked things, was the shining figure and the great man of the North in his day, got much in the North and kept it, got Brandenburg for one there, a conspicuous country ever since,&quot; says [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], who called Albert &quot;a restless, much-managing, wide- warring man.&quot;  He is also called by later writers &quot;the Handsome.&quot;

==Family and children==
He was married in [[1124]] to [[Sofie of Winzenburg]] (d. [[25 March]] [[1160]]) and they had the following children:

Having studied at the university of [[Frankfurt an der Oder]], 
Albert entered the ecclesiastical profession, and in [[1513]] became 
[[archbishop]] of [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]] and administrator of the [[Diocese of Halberstadt]].  

In [[1514]] he obtained the [[Electorate of Mainz]], 
and in [[1518]] was made a [[Cardinal_(Catholicism)|cardinal]].  Meanwhile to pay for the [[pallium]] of the see of Mainz and to discharge the other 
expenses of his elevation, Albert had borrowed 21,000 [[ducat]]s  from [[Jacob Fugger]], and had obtained permission from [[Pope Leo X]] to conduct the sale of [[indulgences]] in his diocese to 
obtain funds to repay this loan, as long as half the collection was forwarded to the Papacy. An agent of the Fuggers subsequently traveled in the Cardinal's retinue in charge of the cashbox.  For this work he procured 
the services of [[John Tetzel]], and so indirectly exercised a 
potent influence on the course of the [[Reformation]].  

When the imperial election of [[1519]] drew near, the elector's vote was 
eagerly solicited by the partisans of Charles (afterwards 
the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]) and by those of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], King of France, and he appears to have received a large amount of 
money for the vote, which he cast eventually for Charles.  

Albert's large and liberal ideas, his friendship with [[Ulrich von Hutten]], and his political ambitions, appear to have raised 
hopes that he would be won over to [[Protestantism]]; but 
after the [[Peasants' War]] of [[1525]] he ranged himself definitely 
among the supporters of [[Catholicism]], and was among the princes 
who met to concert measures for its defence at [[Dessau]] in July 
[[1525]].  

His hostility towards the reformers, however, was 
not so extreme as that of his brother Joachim I, Elector of 
Brandenburg; and he appears to have exerted himself in the 
interests of peace, although he was a member of the [[League of Nuremberg]], which was formed in [[1538]] as a counterpoise to the [[League of Schmalkalden]].  

The new doctrines nevertheless 
made considerable progress in his dominions, and he was 
compelled to grant religious liberty to the inhabitants 
of Magdeburg in return for 500,000 [[German florin|florin]]s.  During his 
latter years indeed he showed more intolerance towards the 
Protestants, and favoured the teaching of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in his 
dominions.  

Albert adorned the [[collegiate church]] (''Stiftskirche'')  at [[Halle (Saale)]] and 
the [[Mainz Cathedral|cathedral at Mainz]] in sumptuous fashion, and took as his 
motto the words ''Domine, dilexi decorem domus tuae'' (Latin for: &quot;Lord, I admired the adornment of your house.&quot;). A generous 
patron of art and learning, he counted [[Erasmus]] among his 
friends.  

He died at [[Aschaffenburg]] on September 24, 1545.

[[Image:Albert_of_Prussia.jpg|right|]]
'''Albert''' ([[May 16]], [[1490]] - [[March 20]], [[1568]]), ('''Albertus''' in [[Latin]], '''Albrecht''' in [[German language|German]]) Grand Master of the [[Teutonic Order]] and first duke of [[Ducal Prussia]], was the third son of [[Frederick I Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|Frederick of Hohenzollern]], prince of [[Ansbach]] and [[Bayreuth]], and Sophia, daughter of [[Casimir IV Jagiello]] Grand Duke of [[Lithuania]] and King of [[Poland]] and his wife Elisabeth of [[Habsburg]]. 

Born at [[Ansbach]] on May 16, 1490, he was intended for the church, and spent some time at the court of Hermann, elector of [[Cologne]], who appointed him canon in his cathedral.

Duke Albrecht's Titles (on his proclamation of 1561, Koenigsberg): ''Albrecht the Elder, Margrave of Brandenburg, in Prussia, Stettin in Pomerania Duke of the Cassuben (Kashubs) and Wends, Burggrave of Nuremberg and Count of Ruegen etc''. 

Turning to a more active life, Albrecht accompanied the emperor [[Maximilian I]] to [[Italy]] in 1508, and after his return spent some time in [[Hungary]]. 

In December, [[Friedrich of Saxony (1473-1510)|Frederick]], Grand Master of the [[Teutonic Order]], died, and Albert was chosen as his successor early in [[1511]] in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle [[Sigismund I of Poland|Sigismund I the Old]] Grand Duke of [[Lithuania]] and King of Poland, would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over east Prussia, which had been held by the Order under Polish suzerainty since the [[Second Treaty of Thorn]] in 1466, but this was not acknowledged by pope or emperor and had been circumvented by the Grand Masters. 

The new Grand Master, aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy, refused to submit to the crown of Poland and as war to retain independence appeared inevitable, he made strenuous efforts to secure allies, and carried on protracted negotiations with Emperor Maximilian I. 

The ill-feeling, influenced by the ravages of members of the Order in Poland, culminated in a struggle which began in [[December]] [[1519]]. During the ensuing year Prussia was devastated, and Albert was granted a four-year truce early in [[1521]]. 

The dispute was referred to the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and other princes, but as no settlement was reached he continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war. For this purpose he visited the [[Diet of Nuremberg]] in [[1522]], where he made the acquaintance of the [[Protestant reformation|reformer]], [[Andreas Osiander]], by whose influence he was won over to the new faith. 

He then journeyed to [[Wittenberg]], where he was advised by [[Martin Luther (religious leader)|Martin Luther]] to abandon the rules of his Order, to marry, and to convert Prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself. This proposal, which was understandably appealing to Albert, had already been discussed by some of his relatives, but it was necessary to proceed cautiously, and he assured [[Pope Adrian VI]] that he was anxious to reform the Order and punish the knights who had adopted [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] doctrines. Luther for his part did not stop at the suggestion, but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the Prussians, while Albert's brother, [[Georg Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|Georg]], Prince of Ansbach, laid the scheme before their uncle [[Sigismund I of Poland|Sigismund of Poland]]. After some delay the king assented to it, with the proviso that [[Ducal Prussia|Prussia]] should be treated as a Polish fiefdom, and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a treaty concluded at [[Kraków]], Albert pledged a personal oath to Sigismund I and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on February 10, 1525.

[[Albrecht Hohenzollern]] and his brothers receive the [[Duchy of Prussia]] as a [[fiefdom]] from the Polish King, [[Sigismundus I the Elder]] in [[1525]].]] 

The [[Estates of the realm | Estates]] of the land then met at [[Kaliningrad|Königsberg]] and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke, who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of Luther. This transition did not, however, take place without protest. Summoned before the imperial court of justice, Albert refused to appear and was proscribed, while the Order, having deposed the Grand Master, made a feeble effort to recover Prussia.  But as the German princes were experiencing the tumult of the Reformation, the peasants' revolt, and the wars against the conquering Turks, they did not attack the duke, and agitation against him soon died away. 

In imperial politics Albert was fairly active. Joining the [[League of Torgau]] in [[1526]], he acted in unison with the Protestants, and was among the princes who banded together to overthrow Charles V after the issue of the [[Augsburg Interim]] in May [[1548]]. For various reasons, however, poverty and personal inclination among others, he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period. 

The early years of Albert's rule in Prussia were fairly prosperous. Although he had some trouble with the peasantry, the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court. 

He did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life. In 1544, in spite of some opposition, he founded the [[Königsberg University|university at Königsberg]], where he appointed his friend [[Osiander]] to a professorship in [[1549]]. Albert also paid for the  printing of the Astronomical Tables (&quot;Prutenische Tafeln&quot;) compiled by [[Erasmus Reinhold]].

This step was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of Albert's reign. Osiander's divergence from Luther's doctrine of justification by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with [[Melanchthon]], who had adherents in Königsberg, and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town. The duke strenuously supported Osiander, and the area of the quarrel soon broadened. There were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles, the burden of taxation was heavy, and Albert's rule became unpopular. 

After Osiander's death in [[1552]] he favoured a preacher named [[Johann Funck]], who, with an adventurer named [[Paul Skalic | Paul Scalich]], exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense. The state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the possibility of Albert's early death and the need, should that happen, to appoint a [[regent]], as his only son, [[Albert Frederick]] was still a mere youth. The duke was consequently obliged to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of Osiander, and the climax came in 1566 when the [[Estates of the realm | Estates]] appealed to [[Sigismund II]], Albert's cousin, son of Sigismund I and Elisabeth Habsburg, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, who sent a commission to Königsberg. Scalich saved his life by flight, but Funck was executed. The question of the regency was settled, and a form of Lutheranism was adopted, and declared binding on all teachers and preachers. 

Virtually deprived of power, the Duke lived for two more years, and died at [[Tapiau]] on [[March 20]], [[1568]]. He had married Dorothea, daughter of [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick]], King of [[Denmark]] in [[1526]], and following her death in [[1547]], married Anna Maria, daughter of [[Eric I of Brunswick|Eric I]], Duke of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]]. 

Albert was a voluminous letterwriter, and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time. 

For switching to Protestantism Albrecht had been excommunicated by the Pope. The [[Habsburg]] rulers of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] continued to claim the office of Grand Master of the [[Teutonic Knights]] as administrators of Prussia.

In [[1891]] a statue was erected to his memory at [[Kaliningrad|Königsberg]].

'''Aachen''' ([[French language|French]] ''Aix-la-Chapelle'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''Aken'', [[Latin]] ''Aquisgranum'', [[Ripuarian]] ''Oche'') is a spa city in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]], on the border with [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], 65 km to the west of [[Cologne]], and the westernmost city in Germany.

[[RWTH Aachen]], established in 1870, is one of the major Institutes of Technology, especially for electrical and mechanical engineering, computer sciences and physics. As a part of it, the [[Klinikum Aachen]] is the biggest single-building hospital in Europe. Over time, a host of software and computer industries have developed around the university.

==History==
A quarry on the Lousberg, where flint was obtained in Neolithic times attests to the long occupation of the site of Aachen. 

The [[Roman empire|Romans]] named the [[hot spring|hot sulphur springs]] of Aachen ''Aquis-Granum''. For the origin of the ''Granus'' several theories were developed, but it is now widely accepted that it derives from a local Celtic god of healing water, not elsewhere attested. Many other Celtic [[toponym]]s are identifiable in the immediate locale. Since [[Roman empire|Roman]] times, the hot springs have been channeled into baths (which are still in use). ''âh-'' is an [[German language|Old German]] cognate with [[Latin]] ''aqua'', both meaning &quot;water&quot;. In French-speaking areas of the former [[Roman Empire|Empire]] the word ''aquas'' was turned into ''aix'', hence Aix-la-Chapelle or [[Aix-en-Provence]], an old Roman spa in [[Provence]], [[France]].
[[Image:Construction d Aix-la-Chapelle.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of Aix-la-Chapelle, by [[Jean Fouquet]]]]
After Roman times the place passed without comment but could not have been totally abandoned, for [[Einhard]] mentioned that in 765-66 [[Pippin the Younger|Pippin]] spent both Christmas and Easter at ''Aquis villa'' (''Et celebravit natalem Domini in Aquis villa et pascha similiter'') [http://www.noctes-gallicanae.org/Charlemagne/Annales/Pepin_le_Bref.htm], which must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months. In the year of his coronation [[768]] [[Charlemagne]] came to spend Christmas at Aachen for the first time. He liked the place and twenty years later he began to build a palace. The sole surviving remnant of the palace, its magnificent chapel constructed in 796, later became [[Aachen Cathedral]]. Charlemagne spent most winters between [[800]] and his death in [[814]] in Aachen in order to enjoy the hot springs. Afterwards the king was buried in the chapel, where his tomb can still be found.

In [[936]] [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] was crowned emperor in the cathedral. From then on the emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were crowned &quot;[[King of the Germans]]&quot; in Aachen, for the next 600 years. The last king to be crowned here was [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in 1531.
 
During the [[Middle Ages]] Aachen was one of the largest cities of the Empire. Aachen remained a free city within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In the [[Imperial Circle Estates]] of the [[Imperial Reform|Reichsreform]] (Imperial Reform) concluded at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in 1495, Aachen was represented in the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian circle. 

After the [[Thirty Years War]] Aachen only had regional importance. However, the city became the site of several important congresses and peace treaties: the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|first congress of Aachen]] (often referred to as ''congress of Aix-la-Chapelle'' in English) in 1668, leading to the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|First Treaty of Aachen]] in the same year which ended the [[War of Devolution]]. The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second congress]] ended with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second treaty]] in 1748, finishing the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|third congress]] took place in 1818 to decide the fate of occupied France.

By 1880, the population was 80,000. Several important [[railway]]s met in Aachen. The city became a site for the manufacturing of railroad [[iron]], [[pin]]s, [[needle]]s, [[button]]s, [[tobacco]], [[wool]]en goods and [[silk]] goods. 

Badly damaged in [[World War II]], on [[October 21]] [[1944]] Aachen was the first German city to be overrun by [[Allies#World War II|Allied]] troops, the [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division]](aka the [[Big Red One]]).

While Charlemagne's palace does not exist anymore, the cathedral is still the main attraction of the city. After its construction it was the largest church north of the [[Alps]] for 400 years. The tombs of Charlemagne and [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] can be found in the church. The cathedral of Aachen is listed in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage]].

==Miscellaneous==
Aachen is an industrial centre and a major railway junction, including the [[Thalys]] high-speed train network. A major industry of the past was needle production, which led to the distinctive mark of the people from Aachen, the ''Klenkes''. The small finger of the right hand is spread from the hand, which was originally the way women sorted the needles.

[[Robert Browning]]'s poem &quot;How they brought the good news from Ghent to Aix&quot; refers to Aachen, but not to any historical fact.

The annual CHIO (short for the French ''Concours Hippique International Officiel'') is the biggest [[equestrianism|equestrian]] meeting of Germany and among horsemen considered to be as prestigious for equitation as the tournament of [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for tennis. Aachen will also be host of the 2006 [[World Equestrian Games]].

[[Image:GermanyNetherlansBelgiumBORDER.jpg|thumb|200px|German-Netherland-Belgian border is easily seen from the west edge of town]]

The local football team [[Alemannia Aachen]] plays in Germany's second division. Their stadium is called [[Tivoli, Aachen|Tivoli]].

Since 1950 the city annually awards the [[Karlspreis]] (German for ''Charlemagne Award'') to persons who did extraordinary service for the unification of Europe. In 2003 the medal was awarded to [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]]. In 2004, [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]'s efforts to unite Europe were honored with an ''Extraordinary Charlemagne Medal'', which was awarded for the first time ever.

The local speciality of Aachen are cookies called ''Printen'', a local version of [[gingerbread]]. Unlike [[gingerbread]] (German:''[[Lebkuchen]]''), which is sweetened with honey, ''Printen'' are sweetened with sugar.

In 1372, Aachen became the first coin issuing city in the world to regularly place an [[Anno Domini]] date on a general circulation [[coin]], a [[groschen]]. It is written MCCCLXXII. None with this date are known to be in existence any longer. The earliest date for which an Aachen coin is still extant is dated 1373.

'''Agate''' is a term applied not to a distinct [[mineral]] species, but to an aggregate of various forms of [[silicon dioxide|silica]], chiefly [[chalcedony]]. 

According to [[Theophrastus]], the agate (achates) was named from the river Achates, now the [[Drillo]], in [[Sicily]], where the stone was first found.  

== Formation and characteristics ==
Most agates occur as nodules in eruptive rocks or ancient [[lava]]s where they represent cavities originally produced by the disengagement of vapour in the molten mass which were then filled, wholly or partially, by siliceous matter deposited in regular layers upon the walls. Such agates, when cut transversely, exhibit a succession of parallel lines, often of extreme tenuity, giving a banded appearance to the section. Such stones are known as banded agate, riband agate and striped agate.  

In the formation of an ordinary agate, it is probable that waters containing silica in solution -- derived, perhaps, from the decomposition of some of the silicates in the lava itself -- percolated through the rock and deposited a siliceous coating on the interior of the vapour-vesicles. Variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposit may cause corresponding variation in the successive layers, so that bands of chalcedony often alternate with layers of crystalline [[quartz]]. Several vapour-vesicles may unite while the rock is [[Viscosity|viscous]], and thus form a large cavity which may become the home of an agate of exceptional size; thus a [[Brazil|Brazilian]] [[geode]] lined with [[amethyst]] and weighing 35 tons was exhibited at the [[Dusseldorf Exhibition]] of [[1902]]. 

The first deposit on the wall of a cavity, forming the &quot;skin&quot; of the agate, is generally a dark greenish mineral substance, like [[celadonite]], [[delessite]] or &quot;[[green earth]],&quot; which are  rich in [[iron]] probably derived from the decomposition of the [[augite]] in the mother-rock. This green silicate may give rise by alteration to a brown [[oxide]] of iron ([[limonite]]), producing a rusty appearance on the outside of the agate-nodule. The outer surface of an agate, freed from its matrix, is often pitted and rough, apparently in consequence of the removal of the original coating. The first layer spread over the wall of the cavity has been called the &quot;priming,&quot; and upon this base zeolitic minerals may be deposited.  

[[Image:Agate banded 750pix.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Banded agate. The specimen is one inch (2.5 cm) wide.]]

Many agates are hollow, since deposition has not proceeded far enough to fill the cavity, and in such cases the last deposit commonly consists of quartz, often amethyst, having the apices of the [[crystal]]s directed towards the free space so as to form a crystal-lined cavity, or geode. 

On the disintegration of the matrix in which the agates are embedded, they are set free. Being a siliceous material, which is extremely resistant to the action of air and water, they remain as nodules in the [[soil]] and [[gravel]], or become rolled as pebbles in streams. 

== Types of agate ==

A [[Mexico|Mexican]] agate, showing only a single [[eye]], has received the name of &quot;[[cyclops (rock)|cyclops]] agate.&quot; Included matter of a green, golden, red, black or other colour or combinations embedded in the chalcedony and disposed in filaments and other forms suggestive of vegetable growth, gives rise to dendritic or [[moss agate]] (named varieties include Maury Mountain, Richardson Ranch, Sheep Creek and others). 
'''Dendritic''' agates have beautiful fern like patterns on them formed due to the presence of manganese and iron ions. Other types of included matter deposited during agate-building include sagenitic growths (radial mineral crystals) and chunks of entrapped detritus (such as sand, ash, or mud). Occasionally agate fills a void left by decomposed vegatative material such as a tree limb or root and is called limb cast agate due to its appearance.

Turritella agate is formed from [[fossil]] Turritella shells silicified in a chalcedony base. Turritella are spiral marine [[gastropod]]s having elongated, spiral shells composed of many whorls. Similarly, [[coral]], [[petrified wood]] and other organic remains or porous rocks can also become agatized. Agatized coral is often referred to as [[Petoskey stone|Petoskey]] agate or stone.

Certain stones, when examined in thin sections by transmitted light, show a diffraction spectrum due to the extreme delicacy of the successive bands, whence they are termed [[rainbow agates]]. Often agate coexists with layers or masses of opal, jasper or crystaline quartz due to ambient variations during the formation process.

Other forms of agate include carnelian agate (usually exhibiting redish hues), Botswana agate, blue lace agate, plume agate (such as Carey, Graveyard Point, Sage, St. Johns, Teeter Ranch and others), tube agate (with visible flow channels), fortification agate (which exhibit little or no layered structure), fire agate (which seems glow internally like an opal) and Mexican crazy-lace agate (which exhibits an often brightly colored, complex banded pattern).

== Agate beliefs ==
[[Image:Agatebots.jpg|thumb|right|Faceted Botswana agate]]
In [[Islam]], agates are deemed to be very precious stones. According to tradition, the wearer of an agate ring, for example, is believed to be protected from various mishaps and will enjoy longevity, among other benefits. In other traditions agate is believed to cure the stings of [[scorpion]]s and the bites of [[snake]]s, soothe the mind, prevent [[Disease|contagion]], still [[thunder]] and [[lightning]], promote [[eloquence]], secure the favour of the powerful, and bring victory over enemies. Persian [[magi]] are also known to have prized agate rings in their work and beliefs.

The [[Shia]] Book of collected prayers, ''Mafatih Al-janan'', quotes the fifth Shia saint Imam [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] on agates, as such:

''&quot;Whosoever endures the night 'til sunrise wearing an agate ring on his/her right hand, before seeing or being seen by any human that morning, turns the agate ring toward the palm side of his/her hand, and while looking at the gem recites the 97th chapter of the Qur'an followed by this prayer [specified], then the God of the Universe shall grant him/her immunity on that day from any danger that falls from the sky, or rises up to it, or which disappears into the earth, or rises out of it, and he/she shall remain protected by the power of God and the agents of God until dusk.&quot;'' (p1212 of version by Haj Sheikh Abbas Qomi)

'''Aspirin''' or '''acetylsalicylic acid''' is a [[Medication|drug]] in the family of [[salicylate]]s, often used as an [[analgesic]] (against minor pains and aches), [[antipyretic]] (against [[fever]]), and anti-[[inflammation|inflammatory]]. It has also an [[anticoagulant]] (blood-thinning) effect and is used in long-term low-doses to prevent [[heart attack]]s.

Low-dose long-term aspirin irreversibly blocks formation of [[thromboxane]] A2 in  [[platelet]]s, producing an inhibitory effect on [[platelet aggregation]], and this blood-thinning property makes it useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks. Aspirin produced for this purpose often comes in 75 or 81 [[Milligram|mg]] dispersible [[tablet]]s and is sometimes called &quot;Junior aspirin.&quot; High doses of aspirin are also given immediately after an acute heart attack. These doses may also inhibit the synthesis of [[prothrombin]] and may therefore produce a second and different anticoagulant effect.

Several hundred fatal overdoses of aspirin occur annually, but the vast majority of its uses are beneficial.  Its primary undesirable side effects, especially in stronger doses, are [[gastrointestinal]] distress (including [[gastric ulcer|ulcers]] and stomach bleeding) and [[tinnitus]]. Another side effect, due to its anticoagulant properties, is increased bleeding in [[menstruating]] women. Because there appears to be a connection between aspirin and [[Reye's syndrome]], aspirin is no longer used to control flu-like symptoms in minors.

Aspirin was the first discovered member of the class of drugs known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ([[NSAID]]s), not all of which are salicylates, though they all have similar effects and a similar action mechanism.

== ASPIRIN ==

The brand name ''Aspirin'' was coined by the [[Bayer]] company of [[Germany]]. In some countries the name is used as a [[genericized trademark|generic term]] for the drug rather than the manufacturer's [[trademark]]. In countries in which Aspirin remains a trademark, the [[initialism]] '''ASA''' is used as a generic term ('''ASS''' in German-language countries, for ''Acetylsalicylsäure''; '''AAS''' in Spanish- and Portuguese-language countries, for ''ácido acetilsalicílico'').
[[Image:Aspirin.jpg|thumb|Aspirin]]
The name &quot;aspirin&quot; is composed of ''a-'' (from the [[acetyl group]]) ''-spir-'' (from the ''[[spiraea]]'' flower) and ''-in'' (a common ending for drugs at the time). On [[March 6]], [[1899]][[Bayer]] registered it as a [[trademark]].

However, the German company lost the right to use the trademark in many countries as the [[Allies]] seized and resold its foreign assets after [[World War I]]. The right to use &quot;Aspirin&quot; in the United States (along with all other Bayer trademarks) was purchased from the U.S. government by Sterling Drug, Inc. in [[1918]]. Even before the [[patent]] for the drug expired in [[1917]], Bayer had been unable to stop competitors from copying the formula and using the name elsewhere, and so, with a flooded market, the public was unable to recognize &quot;Aspirin&quot; as coming from only one manufacturer. Sterling was subsequently unable to prevent &quot;Aspirin&quot; from being ruled a [[genericized trademark]] in a U.S. federal court in [[1921]]. Sterling was ultimately acquired by Bayer in 1994, but this did not restore the U.S. trademark.  Other countries (such as [[Canada]]) still consider &quot;Aspirin&quot; a protected trademark.

== Discovery ==

[[Image:Acetylsalicylicacid.jpg|thumb|180px|Acetylsalicylic acid crystals]]
[[Hippocrates]], a [[Hellenic civilization|Greek]] physician, wrote in the [[5th century BC]] about a bitter powder extracted from [[willow]] bark that could ease aches and pains and reduce fevers. This remedy is also mentioned in texts from ancient [[Sumeria]], [[Egypt]] and [[Assyria]]. Native Americans claim to have used it for headaches, fever, sore muscles, rheumatism, and chills. The Reverend [[Edward Stone]], a vicar from Chipping Norton in [[Oxfordshire]] [[England]], noted in [[1763]] that the bark of the willow was effective in reducing a fever.

The active extract of the bark, called ''salicin'', after the [[Latin]] name for the White willow (''[[Salix alba]]''), was isolated to its crystalline form in [[1828]] by [[Henri Leroux]], a [[France|French]] pharmacist, and [[Raffaele Piria]], an [[Italy|Italian]] chemist, who then succeeded in separating out the acid in its pure state. Salicin is highly acidic when in a saturated solution with water ([[pH]] = 2.4), and is called [[salicylic acid]] for that reason.

This chemical was also isolated from [[meadowsweet]] flowers (genus ''[[Filipendula]]'', formerly classified in ''[[Spiraea]]'') by German researchers in 1839. While their extract was somewhat effective, it also caused digestive problems such as irritated stomach and diarrhea, and even death when consumed in high doses. In 1853, a French chemist named Charles Frederic Gerhardt neutralized salicylic acid by buffering it with sodium (sodium salicylate) and acetyl chloride, creating acetosalicylic anhydride. Gerhardt's product worked, but he had no desire to market it and abandoned his discovery. In 1897, [[Felix Hoffmann]], a researcher at [[Bayer|Friedrich Bayer &amp; Co.]] in [[Germany]], derivatized one of the [[hydroxy|hydroxyl]] [[functional group]]s in salicylic acid with an [[acetyl]] group (forming the acetyl [[ester]]), which greatly reduced the negative effects.  This was the first synthetic drug, not a copy of something that existed in nature, and the start of the pharmaceuticals industry.  Hoffmann
made some of the formula and gave it to his father, who was suffering from the pain of arthritis and could not stand the side effects of salicylic acid. With good results, he then convinced [[Bayer]] to market the new wonder drug. Aspirin was patented on March 6, 1899. It was marketed alongside another of Hoffmann's products, an acetylated synthetic of [[morphine]] called [[Heroin]].  Heroin was initially the more successful of the two painkillers, but, as Heroin's shortcoming of addictiveness became more obvious, Aspirin stepped to the forefront.  Aspirin was originally sold as a powder and was an instant success; in 1915, Bayer introduced Aspirin tablets.

[[Image:BayerHeroin.png|thumb|right|150px|Advertisement for Aspirin, Heroin, Lycetol, Salophen]]

Several claims to invention of aspirin have arisen.  Acetylsalicylic acid was already being manufactured by the Chemische Fabrik von Heyden Company in [[1897]], although without a brand name.  [[Arthur Eichengrün]] claimed in [[1949]] that he planned and directed the synthesis of aspirin while Hoffmann's role was restricted to the initial lab synthesis using Eichengrün's process.  In [[1999]], Walter Sneader of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of [[Strathclyde]] in [[Glasgow]] reexamined the case and agreed with Eichengrün's account. Bayer continues to recognize Felix Hoffmann as aspirin's official inventor.  Despite its argued origin, Bayer's marketing was responsible for bringing it to the world.

It was not until the [[1970]]s that the mechanism of action of aspirin and similar drugs called [[NSAID]]s was elucidated (see below).

==Synthesis of aspirin==

[[Image:Aspirin-synthesis.gif]]

Aspirin is commercially synthesized using a two-step process.  First, [[phenol]] (generally extracted from coal tar) is treated with a sodium base generating sodium phenoxide, which is then reacted with [[carbon dioxide]] under high temperature and pressure to yield salicylate, which is acidifed, yielding [[salicylic acid]].

Salicylic acid is then acylated using [[acetic anhydride]], yielding aspirin.  It is a common experiment performed in organic chemistry labs, and generally tends to produce low yields due to the relative difficulty of its extraction from an aqueous state.

Formulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell of vinegar, this is because aspirin can undergo autocatalytic degradation to salicylic acid in moist conditions, yielding salicylic acid and [[acetic acid]].

== How it works ==

In a piece of research for which he was awarded both a [[Nobel prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine| Physiology or Medicine]] in 1982 and a knighthood, [[John Robert Vane]], who was then employed by the Royal College of Surgeons in London, showed in 1971 that aspirin suppresses the production of [[prostaglandins]] and [[thromboxanes]]. This happens because [[cyclooxygenase]], an [[enzyme]] that participates in the production of  prostaglandins and thromboxanes, is irreversibly inhibited when aspirin acetylates it. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDS (such as [[diclofenac]] and [[ibuprofen]]), which are reversible inhibitors.

Prostaglandins are local [[hormone]]s (paracrine) produced in the body and have diverse effects in the body, including but not limited to transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] thermostat, and inflammation.
Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of [[platelet]]s that form [[clot|blood clots]]. Heart attacks are primarily caused by blood clots, and their reduction with the introduction of small amounts of aspirin has been seen to be an effective medical intervention. The side-effect of this is that the ability of the blood in general to clot is reduced, and excessive bleeding may result from the use of aspirin.
[[Image:Aspirin-rod-povray.png|thumb|right|3D model of chemical structure of aspirin]]
More recent work has shown that there are at least two different types of cyclooxygenase: COX-1 and COX-2. Aspirin inhibits both of them. Newer [[NSAID]] drugs called [[COX-2 selective inhibitor]]s have been developed that inhibit only COX-2, with the hope for reduction of gastrointestinal side-effects.

However, several of the new [[COX-2 selective inhibitor]]s have been recently withdrawn, after evidence emerged that COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack. It is proposed that endothelial cells lining the arteries in the body express COX-2, and, by selectively inhibiting COX-2, prostaglandins (specifically PGF2) are downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as COX-1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anti-coagulative effect of PGF2 is decreased, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new COX once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, rendering them &quot;useless&quot;: an important difference with reversible inhibitors.

Furthermore, aspirin has 2 additional modes of actions, contributing to its strong analgesic, antipyretic and antiinflammatory properties:

* It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria.
* It induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body that enable the white blood cells (leukocytes) to fight infections more effectively. This has been found recently by Dr. Derek W. Gilroy, winning Bayer's International Aspirin Award 2005.

Also, recently aspirin has been proven to prevent carcinoma of the colon, if given in low doses over years.

== Indications ==

Aspirin, as with many older drugs, has proven to be useful in many conditions, and, despite its well-known toxicity, it is widely used, since physicians are familiar with its properties. Indications for its use include:

* [[Fever]]
* [[Pain]] (especially useful for conditions involving osteoid [[osteoma]], [[arthritis]] and chronic pain)
* [[Migraine]]
* [[Myocardial infarction]] prophylaxis (low dose)
* [[Rheumatic fever]] (drug of choice)
* [[Kawasaki's Disease]] (along with IVIG)

== Contraindications and warnings ==

* Do ''not'' take this medicine if you are allergic to aspirin, [[ibuprofen]] or [[naproxen]].
* Talk to your doctor if your symptoms do ''not'' improve after a few days of therapy.
* If you have [[kidney disease]], [[ulcer]]s, mild [[diabetes]], [[gout]] or [[gastritis]], talk to your doctor before using this medicine.
* Taking aspirin with [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] increases the chance of stomach bleeding. Avoid alcohol with this medicine.
* Giving aspirin to children, including teenagers having a cold or flu can cause a serious condition known as [[Reye's syndrome]].
* Patients with [[hemophilia]], other bleeding tendencies, or a bleeding ulcer should not take salicylates.
* Some sources recommend that patients with [[hyperthyroidism]] avoid aspirin because it elevates T4 levels. [http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40001339/]

== Common side-effects ==

* Gastrointestinal complaints (stomach upset, [[dyspepsia]], heartburn, small blood loss). To help avoid these problems, it is recommended that aspirin be taken at or after meals. Undetected blood loss may lead to [[hypochromic anemia]].
* Severe gastrointestinal complaints (gross bleeding and/or ulceration), requiring discontinuation and immediate treatment. Patients receiving high doses and/or long-term treatment should receive gastric protection with high-dosed antacids, [[ranitidine]] or [[omeprazole]].
* Frequently, central effects (dizziness, [[tinnitus]], hearing loss, [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], centrally mediated vision disturbances, and headaches). The higher the daily dose is, the more likely it is that central nervous system side effects will occur.
* Sweating, seen with high doses, independent from antipyretic action
* Long-term treatment with high doses (arthritis and rheumatic fever): often increased liver enzymes without symptoms, rarely reversible liver damage. The potentially fatal [[Reye's syndrome]] may occur, if given to pediatric patients with fever and other signs of infections. The syndrome is due to fatty degeneration of liver cells. Up to 30 percent of those afflicted will eventually die. Prompt hospital treatment may be life-saving.
* Chronic [[nephritis]] with long-term use, usually if used in combination with certain other painkillers. This condition may lead to chronic renal failure.
* Prolonged and more severe bleeding after operations and post-traumatic for up to 10 days after the last aspirin dose. If one wishes to counteract the bleeding tendency, fresh [[thrombocyte]] concentrate will usually work.
* Skin reactions, [[angioedema]], and [[bronchospasm]] have all been seen infrequently.

== Overdose ==
Aspirin overdose has serious consequences and is potentially lethal. Possible effects of overdose include [[tinnitus]], abdominal pain, [[hypokalemia]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[pyrexia]], [[hyperventilation]], [[cardiac arrhythmia|dysrhythmia]], [[hypotension]], [[hallucination]], [[renal failure]], [[Mental confusion|confusion]], [[seizure]], [[coma]] and [[death]].

Overdose can be acute or chronic; that is, a person can overdose by taking one very large dose or smaller doses over a period of time. Acute overdose has a [[mortality rate]] of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal with a mortality rate of 25%. The most common cause of death during an aspirin overdose is [[pulmonary edema|noncardiogenic pulmonary edema]].

An acute-overdose patient must be taken to a hospital immediately. Contrary to the [[urban legend]], you can die from eating a bottle of pills, even if you subsequently throw up. Treatment of an acute overdose requires ingestion of [[activated charcoal]] to neutralize the acetylsalicylic acid in the [[gastrointestinal tract]], followed by a [[stomach pump]] with subsequent re-ingestion of [[activated charcoal]].  Patients are then monitored for at least 12 hours and typically given [[intravenous]] [[potassium chloride]] to counteract [[hypokalemia]], [[sodium bicarbonate]] to neutralize [[salicylate]] in the blood and restore the blood's sensitive pH balance, and [[glucose]] to restore [[blood sugar]] levels. Frequent blood work is performed to check [[metabolic]], [[salicylate]], and [[blood sugar]] levels; [[arterial blood gas]] assessments are performed to test for [[alkalosis|respiratory alkalosis]] and [[metabolic acidosis]]. If the overdose was intentional, the patient will undergo psychiatric
evaluation, as with any [[suicide]] attempt.

Fifty-two deaths involving single-ingredient aspirin were reported in the United States in the year 2000.{{ref|litovitz-2001}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the [[Book of Samuel]], '''Abner''' ([[Biblical Hebrew]] for &quot;father of [or is a] light&quot;), is first cousin to [[Saul the King|Saul]] and commander-in-chief of his army (1 Samuel 14:50, 20:25).  He is only referred to incidentally in Saul's history (1 Samuel 17:55, 26:5), and is not mentioned in the account of the disastrous [[battle of Gilboa]] when Saul's power was crushed.  Seizing the youngest but only surviving of Saul's sons, [[Ishbaal]], Abner set him up as king over [[Kingdom of Israel|Israel]] at [[Mahanaim]], east of the [[Jordan River|Jordan]]. [[David]], who was accepted as king by [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] alone, was meanwhile reigning at [[Hebron]], and for some time war was carried on between the two parties.  

The only engagement between the rival factions which is told at length is noteworthy, inasmuch as it was preceded by an encounter at [[Gibeon]] between twelve chosen men from each side, in which the whole twenty-four seem to have perished (2 Samuel 2:12).  In the general engagement which followed, Abner was defeated and put to flight.  He was closely pursued by [[Asahel]], brother of [[Joab]], who is said to have been &quot;light of foot as a wild roe&quot; (2 Samuel 2:18).  As Asahel would not desist from the pursuit, though warned, Abner was compelled to slay him in 
self-defence.  This originated a deadly [[feud]] between the leaders of the opposite parties, for Joab, as next of kin to Asahel, was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood.

For some time afterwards the war was carried on, the advantage being invariably on the side of David.  At length, Ishbaal lost the main prop of his tottering cause by remonstrating with Abner for marrying [[Rizpah]], one of Saul's [[concubine]]s, an alliance which, according to contemporary notions, implied pretensions to the [[throne]] (cf. 2 Samuel 16:21ff.).

Abner was indignant at the deserved rebuke, and immediately opened negotiatons with David, who welcomed him on the condition that his wife [[Michal]] should be restored to him. This was done, and the proceedings were ratified by a feast.  Almost immediately after, however, Joab, who had been sent away, perhaps intentionally returned and slew Abner at the gate of Hebron.  The ostensible motive for the [[assassination]] was a desire to avenge Asahel, and this would be a sufficient justification for the deed according to the moral standard of the time.  The conduct of David after the event was such as to show that he had no complicity in the act, though he could not venture to punish its perpetrators (2 Samuel 3:31-39; cf. 1 Kings 2:31ff.).

Soon however, Ishbaal/Ishbosheth was assassinated as he slept, and David became king of the reunited kingdoms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Sultan ahmed I.jpg|frame|Sultan Ahmed I]]

'''Ahmed I''' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] أحمد الأول) ([[April 18]], [[1590]] &amp;ndash; [[November 22]], [[1617]]) was the [[sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from [[1603]] until his death.

He succeeded his father [[Mehmed III]] in [[1603]] and became the first Ottoman sultan who reached the throne before attaining his majority. He was of kindly and humane disposition, as he showed by refusing to put to death his brother Mustafa (later [[Mustafa I]]), who eventually succeeded him.  He was known for his skills in fencing, horseback riding, and fluency in numerous languages.  

In the earlier part of his reign he showed decision and vigour, which were belied by his subsequent conduct. The wars which attended his accession both in [[Hungary]] and in [[Iran|Persia]] terminated unfavourably for the Empire, and her prestige received its first check in the [[Treaty of Sitvatorok]], signed in [[1606]], whereby the annual tribute paid by [[Austria]] was abolished. [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] was ceded to Persia.

Ahmed gave himself up to pleasure during the remainder of his reign, which ended in [[1617]], and demoralization and corruption became as general throughout the public service as indisciplin in the ranks of the army.  The use of [[tobacco]] is said to have been introduced in the Empire during his reign. Ahmed I died of [[typhus]] in [[1617]].

Today Ahmed I is remembered mainly for the construction of the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] (also known as the [[Blue Mosque]]), one of the masterpieces of [[Islamic architecture]]. The area in [[Istanbul]] around the Mosque is today called Sultanahmet. He is buried in a masoleum right outside the walls of the famous mosque.

'''Ahmed III''' (Arabic {{ar|أحمد الثالث}}) (born [[December 30]], [[1673]], died [[1736]]) was a [[sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and a son of sultan [[Mehmed IV]]. He succeeded to the throne in 1703 on the abdication of his brother [[Mustafa II]].

Ahmed cultivated good relations with [[England]], in view doubtless of [[Russia]]'s menacing attitude. He afforded a refuge in Turkey to [[Charles XII of Sweden]] after the Swedish defeat at the hands of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. Forced against his will into war with Russia, he came nearer than any Turkish  sovereign before or since to breaking the power of his northern rival, whom his [[grand vizier]] [[Baltaji Mahommed Pasha]] succeeded in completely surrounding near the [[Prut River]] in 1711.

In the treaty which Russia was compelled to sign, the Ottoman Empire obtained the restitution of [[Azov]], the destruction of the forts built by Russia and the undertaking that the [[tsar]] should abstain from future interference in the affairs of the [[Poland|Poles]] or the [[Cossacks]]. Discontent at the leniency of these terms was so strong at [[Constantinople]] that it nearly brought on a renewal of the war.

In 1715 the [[Morea]] was taken from the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]]. This led to hostilities with [[Austria]], in which the Ottoman Empire was unsuccessful, and [[Belgrade]] fell into the hands of Austria in 1717. Through the mediation of England and the [[Netherlands]] the [[peace of Passarowitz]] was concluded in 1718, by which Turkey retained her conquests from the Venetians, but lost [[Hungary]].

A war with [[Persian Empire|Persia]] terminated in disaster, leading to a revolt of the [[Janissary|janissaries]], who deposed Ahmed in September 1730. He died in captivity six years later. 

Nevsehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha directed the government from 1718 to 1730.
{{Details|Nevsehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha}}

The course of the Persian war, in which the Turks had at made successive conquests with little check from the armies, though often impeded by the nature of the country the fierce spirit of the native tribes, became after a few years less favourable to Ottoman ambition. The celebrated Nadir Konli Khan (who afterwards reconquered and conquered states for himself), gained his first renown by exploits against the enemies of Shah Tahmasp. A report reached Constantinople that the lately despised Persians were victorious, and were invading the Ottoman Empire. This speedily caused excitement and tumult. Sultan Ahmet had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged; and on [[20 September]], [[1730]], a mutinous riot of seventeen janissaries, led by the Albanian Patrona Khalil, was encouraged by the citizens as well as the soldiery, till it swelled into an insurrection, before which the Sultan quailed, and gave up the throne. Ahmet voluntarily led his nephew Mahmut to the seat of sovereignty, and made obeisance to him as Padischah of the empire. He then retired to the apartments in the palace from whence his successor had been conducted, and died after a few years of confinement.

The reign of Ahmet III, which had lasted for twenty-seven years, though marked by the deep disasters of the Austrian war, was, on the whole, neither inglorious nor unprosperous. The recovery of Azov and the Morea, and the conquest of part of Persia, more than counterbalanced the territory which had been given up to the Austrian Emperor at the peace of Passarowitz. Ahmet left the finances of the Ottoman Empire in a flourishing condition, which had been obtained without excessive taxation or extortionate rapacity. He was a liberal and discerning patron of literature and art; and it was in his time that the first printing press was set up in Constantinople. It was in this reign that an important change in the government of the Danubian Principaiitics was introduced. Hitherto, the [[Porte]] had employed Voivode.s, or native [[Moldavia]]n and [[Wallachia]]n nobles, to administer those provinces. But after the war with [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in 1711, in which Prince Cantcinir betrayed the Turkish and aided the Russian interests, the Porte established the custom of deputing Greeks from Constantinople as [[Hospodar]]s, or viceroys, of Moldavia and Wallachia. These were generally selected from among the wealthy Greek families that inhabited the quarter of Constantinople called the [[Fanar]], and constituted a kind of Raya Noblesse, which supplied the Porte with functionaries in many important departments of the state. The Moldo-Wallachians called the period of their history, during which they were under Greek viceroys (and which lasted till 1821), the Fanariote period.

The '''Ainu''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] {{IPA|/ˈainu/}}, &quot;eye-noo&quot;, アイヌ / aynu) are an ethnic group [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] to [[Hokkaido]], the northern part of [[Honshu]] in Northern [[Japan]], the [[Kuril Islands]], much of [[Sakhalin]], and the southernmost third of the [[Kamchatka peninsula]]. The word &quot;ainu&quot; means &quot;human&quot; in the [[Ainu language]]; '''[[Emishi]]''', '''[[Ezo]]''' or '''[[Yezo]]''' (&amp;#34662;&amp;#22839;) are [[Japanese language|Japanese]] terms; and '''[[Utari]]''', &amp;#12454;&amp;#12479;&amp;#12522;, (meaning &quot;comrade&quot; in Ainu) is now preferred by some members. There are most likely over 150,000 Ainu today, however the exact figure is not known as many Ainu hide their origins or in many cases are not even aware of them, their parents having kept it from them so as to protect their children from racism.

==Origins==
The origins of the Ainu are uncertain. Some commentators believe that they derive from an ancient proto-Asian stock that may have occupied most of Asia before the [[Han Chinese|Han]] expansion (see [[Jomon|Jomon people]]). Various other Asian [[indigenous peoples]], from the [[Ryukyu]]s to the [[Taiwanese]] are also thought to be related to them.

In the early 20th century [[anthropology|anthropologists]] debated what [[Typology#Anthropology|typological classification]] (such as [[Mongoloid]] or [[Caucasoid]]) the Ainu belonged to.  The typological models of [[Race (historical definitions)|racial classification]] in use at that time have since undergone significant revision, in the light of developments in fields such as [[genetics]]. Many physical characteristics which had been employed to distinguish &quot;Mongoloid&quot;, &quot;Caucasoid&quot; or other racial-types are viewed by many contemporary authorities to arise more typically from climatic or environmental selection, rather than necessary indicators of relatedness/distinctiveness. While a minority still hold to the view that race typology usefully reflects underlying biological differences, the classification of &quot;Mongoloid&quot; versus other groups is mostly seen as being problematic. ''See also [[Tocharians]] and [[Sami]]''

The prevailing mythology in Japan has been of the Ainu as a race of &quot;noble savages,&quot; a proud but reclusive culture of hunter-gatherers.  This mythology became a useful defense for the Japanese expropriation of Ainu lands.  In fact, the Ainu were farmers from the earliest centuries of the [[Common Era]].[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/ainu.html]

==North American Connection==
In the late 20th Century, much speculation arose that the Ainu may have been one of the first groups to settle [[North America]].  This theory is based largely on skeletal and cultural evidence among tribes living in the western part of North America and certain parts of [[Latin America]].  It is quite possible that North America had several peoples among its early settlers--the Ainu being one of them, perhaps even the first.  The most well known instance supporting this theory is probably [[Kennewick Man]].

Genetic mapping studies by [[Cavalli-Sforza]] have shown a pattern of genetic expansion from the area of the [[Sea of Japan]] towards the rest of eastern Asia and the American continent. This appears as the third most important genetic movement in Eastern Asia (after the &quot;Great expansion&quot; from the African continent, and a second expansion from the area of Northern Siberia), which would make it consistent with the early [[Jomon]] period &lt;ref&gt;&quot;The synthetic maps suggest a previously unsuspected center of expansion from the Sea of Japan but cannot indicate dates. This development could be tied to the Jomon period, but one cannot entirely exclude the pre-Jomon period and that it might be responsible for a migration to the Americas. A major source of food in those pre-agricultural times came from fishing, then as now, and this would have limited for ecological reasons the area of expansion to the coastline, perhaps that of the Sea of Japan, but also father along the Pacific Coast&quot; &quot;The History and Geography of Human Genes&quot; p253, Cavalli-Sforza ISBN 0691087504&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
At first, contact with the [[Japanese people]] was friendly and both were equals in a trade relationship. However, eventually the Japanese started to dominate the relationship, and soon established large settlements on the outskirts of Ainu territory. As the Japanese moved north and took control over their traditional lands, the Ainu often gave up without resistance, but there was occasional resistance as exemplified in wars in [[1457]], [[1669]], and [[1789]], all of which were lost by the Ainu. Japanese policies became increasingly aimed at assimilating the Ainu in the [[Meiji period]], outlawing their language and restricting them to farming on government-provided plots. Ainu were also used in near-slavery conditions in the Japanese fishing industry. The island of Hokkaido was called ''Ezo'' or ''Ezo-chi'' during the [[Edo period]]. Its name was changed to Hokkaido during the [[Meiji Restoration]] as part of the programme to &quot;unify&quot; the Japanese national character under the aegis of the Emperor, thus reducing the local identity and autonomy of the different regions of Japan.

As Japanese citizens, the Ainu are now governed by Japanese laws (though one Ainu man was acquitted of murder because he asserted that he was not a Japanese citizen and the judge agreed{{fact}}) and judged by Japanese tribunals, but in the past, their affairs were administered by hereditary chiefs, three in each village, and for administrative purposes the country was divided into three districts, [[Saru]], [[Usu (district)|Usu]] and [[Ishikari]], which were under the ultimate control of Saru, though the relations between their respective inhabitants were not close and intermarriages were avoided. The functions of judge were not entrusted to these chiefs; an indefinite number of a community's members sat in judgement upon its criminals. Capital punishment did not exist, nor was imprisonment resorted to, beating being considered a sufficient and final penalty, except in the case of murder, when the nose and ears of the culprit were cut off or the tendons of his feet severed. Intermarriages between Japanese and Ainu are not infrequent, and at [[Sambutsu]] especially, on the eastern coast, many children of such marriages may be seen.

Today, many Ainu dislike the term Ainu and prefer to identify themselves as ''Utari'' (''comrade'' in the Ainu language). In official documents both names are used.

==Geography==
For historical reasons (primarily the [[Russo-Japanese War]]), nearly all Ainu live in Japan.

There is, however, a small number of Ainu living on [[Sakhalin]], most of them descendants of Sakhalin Ainu who were evicted and later returned. There is also an Ainu minority living at the southernmost area of the Kamchatka Peninsula and on the Kurile Islands. However, the only Ainu speakers remaining (besides perhaps a few partial speakers) live solely in Japan. There, they are concentrated primarily on the southern and eastern coasts of the island of [[Hokkaido]].

Due to intermarriage with the Japanese and ongoing absorption into the predominant culture, few living Ainu settlements exist. Many &quot;authentic Ainu villages&quot; advertised in Hokkaido are simply tourist attractions.

==Language==
The [[Ainu language]] is significantly different from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in its [[syntax]], [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and vocabulary. Although there have been attempts to show that they are related, the vast majority of modern scholars reject that the relationship goes beyond contact, i.e., mutual borrowing of words between Japanese and Ainu. In fact, no attempt to show a relationship with Ainu to any other language has gained wide acceptance, and Ainu is currently considered to be a [[language isolate]].
&lt;!--ethnologue data is incorrect; see [[ainu language]]--&gt;
==Culture==
Traditional Ainu culture is quite different from Japanese culture. Never shaving after a certain age, the men had full [[beard]]s and [[moustache]]s. Men and women alike cut their [[hair]] level with the shoulders at the sides of the head, but trimmed it semicircularly behind. The [[women]] [[tattoo]]ed their [[mouth]]s, [[arm]]s, [[Clitoris|clitorides]], and sometimes their [[forehead]]s, starting at the onset of [[puberty]]. The soot deposited on a pot hung over a fire of birch bark was used for [[colour]]. Their traditional [[dress]] is a robe spun from the bark of the elm tree. It has long sleeves, reaches nearly to the feet, is folded round the body, and is tied with a girdle of the same material. Women also wear an undergarment of Japanese cloth. In winter the skins of animals were worn, with leggings of deerskin and boots made from the skin of dogs or [[salmon]]. Both sexes are fond of earrings, which are said to have been made of [[grape]]vine in former times, as also are bead necklaces called [[tamasay]], which the women prized highly. Their traditional cuisine consists of the flesh of [[bear]], [[fox]], [[wolf]], [[badger]], [[ox]] or [[horse]], as well as [[fish]], [[fowl]], [[millet]], [[vegetable]]s, [[herb]]s, and [[root]]s. They never ate raw [[fish]] or flesh, but always either boiled or roasted it. Their traditional habitations were reed-thatched huts, the largest 20 ft. square, without partitions and having a fireplace in the centre.  There was no chimney, but only a hole at the angle of the roof; there was one window on the eastern side and there were two doors. The house of the village head was used as a public meeting place when one was needed. Instead of using furniture, they sat on the floor, which was covered with two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of flag; and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and employing skins for coverlets. The men used [[chopstick]]s when eating; the women had wooden [[spoon]]s. [[Ainu cuisine]] is uncommonly eaten outside Ainu communities; there are only a few Ainu restaurants in Japan, all located in [[Tokyo]] and [[Hokkaido]].

===Religion===
The Ainu believe in [[Animism]], or that everything in nature has a ''[[kami|kamuy]]'' (spirit or god) on the inside. There is a hierarchy of the ''kamuy''. The most important is grandmother hearth ([[fire]]), then ''kamuy'' of the [[mountain]] (animals), then ''kamuy'' of the [[sea]] ([[Marine biology|sea animals]]), lastly everything else. They have no [[priests]] by profession. The village chief performs whatever religious ceremonies are necessary; ceremonies are confined to making libations of [[sake|rice beer]], uttering [[prayers]], and offering [[willow]] sticks with wooden shavings attached to them. These sticks are called [[Inau]] (singular) and [[Inau|nusa]] (plural).  They are placed on an altar used to sacrifice the heads of killed animals. The Ainu people give thanks to the gods before eating and pray to the deity of fire in time of [[sickness]]. They believe their spirits are [[immortal]], and that their spirits will be rewarded hereafter by ascending to ''kamuy mosir'' (Land of the Gods).

Some Ainu in the north are members of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

===Sport===
The Ainu excel at many competitive physical activities. Due to their taller physical build, the Ainu have outshone the ethnic Japanese in typically Western sports like [[baseball]], [[football (soccer)|football]] (soccer), and [[track and field]] events. This has engendered much resentment from the ethnic Japanese but the athletic feats of the Ainu people are still celebrated throughout Asia nonetheless (Fitzhugh, 364-366)

==Institutions==
There are many different organizations of Ainu trying to further their cause in many different ways. There is an umbrella group of which most Hokkaido Ainu and some other Ainu are members, called the [[Hokkaido Utari Association]], originally controlled by the government with the intention of speeding Ainu assimilation and integration into the Japanese nation-state but which now operates mostly independently of the government and is run exclusively by Ainu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about '''acropolis''' in general. For the best-known example of the kind, see [[Acropolis, Athens]].''

[[image:Athens_Acropolis.jpg|thumb|250px|Acropolis in [[Athens]].]]
'''Acropolis''' (Gr. ''akros,'' top, ''polis,'' city), literally the upper part of a town. For purposes of defence early settlers naturally chose elevated ground, frequently a hill with precipitous sides, and these early citadels became in many parts of the world the nuclei of large cities which grew up on the surrounding lower ground. 

The word &quot;Acropolis&quot;, though Greek in origin and associated primarily with Greek cities ([[Athens]], [[Argos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and [[Corinth]] with its [[Acrocorinth]]), may be applied generically to all such citadels ([[Rome]], [[Jerusalem]], Celtic [[Bratislava]], many in [[Asia Minor]], or even Castle Hill at [[Edinburgh]]). 

The most famous example of the kind is the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis of Athens]], which, by reason of its historical associations and the famous buildings erected upon it, is generally known without qualification as simply &quot;The Acropolis&quot;.

Because of its classical Greco-Roman style, the ruins of [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|Mission San Juan Capistrano's]] &quot;Great Stone Church&quot; (in [[California|California, United States]]) have been dubbed the &quot;American Acropolis&quot;.

Other parts of the world developed other names for the high [[citadel]] or [[alcázar]], which often reinforced a naturally strong site. In Central [[Italy]], many small rural [[comune|commune]]s still cluster at the base of a fortified habitation known as &quot;La Rocca&quot; of the commune.

The term ''Acropolis'' is also used to described the central complex of overlapping structures, such as plazas and pyramids, in many [[Maya]]n cities, including [[Tikal]] and [[Copán]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Acupuncture chart 300px.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Acupuncture chart from the [[Ming dynasty]].]]
'''Acupuncture''' (from Lat. ''acus,'' &quot;needle&quot; (noun), and ''pungere,'' &quot;prick&quot; (verb) or in [[Standard Mandarin]], zhēn jiǔ (針灸) is one of the main branches of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]], or TCM (others being [[herbal medicine]] and [[tui na]]). It is a [[therapy|therapeutic]] technique from that framework intended to restore health and well-being. The technique involves the insertion of needles into &quot;[[acupuncture point]]s&quot; on the body by trained practitioners. The needles most commonly used in present-day practice are made of [[stainless steel]] and are of approximately the same diameter as a medium thickness guitar string (approximately .01&quot; to .02&quot;).  Acupuncture and related practices predate modern concepts of [[science]], and most but not all of its claims are not yet verified in modern studies and clinical practice to the standards of the [[Cochrane Collaboration]].

==History==
In [[China]], the practice of acupuncture can perhaps be traced as far back as the [[1st millennium BC|1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; millennium BC]], and archeological evidence has been identified with the period of the [[Han dynasty]] (from 202 [[Anno Domini|BC]] to 220 [[Anno Domini|AD]]). The practice spread centuries ago into many parts of Asia; in modern times it is a component of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM), and forms of it are also described in the literature of [[traditional Korean medicine]] where it is called ''chimsul''. It is also important in [[Kampo]], the traditional medicine system of [[Japan]].

The earliest Chinese medical texts (Ma-wang-tui graves 68 BC) do not mention acupuncture. Later in Chinese history, 365 points along the meridians were spoken of, not because they were anatomically identified, but because there are 365 days in a year. Different acupuncture charts give different numbers and locations of points. 

The Chinese medical text that first describes acupuncture is The Yellow Emperor’s ''Classic of Internal Medicine (History of Acupuncture)''.  Some hieroglyphics have been found dating back to 1000 BC that may indicate an early use of acupuncture.  Bian stones, sharp pointed stones used to treat diseases in ancient times, have also been discovered in ruins (History of Acupuncture in China) but are not directly related to acupuncture.

RC Crozier in the book ''Traditional medicine in modern China'' (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1968) says the early Chinese Communist Party expressed considerable antipathy towards TCM, ridiculing it as superstitious, irrational and backward, and claiming that it conflicted with the Party’s dedication to science as the way of progress. Acupuncture was included in this criticism.  Reversing this position, Communist Party Chairman [[Mao]] later said that &quot;Chinese medicine and pharmacology are a great treasure house and efforts should be made to explore them and raise them to a higher level&quot;[http://www.healthy.net/scr/article.asp?ID=1708].  [[Barefoot doctors]] were trained to provide inexpensive health care in rural Chinese communities.  After the [[Cultural Revolution]], TCM instruction was incorporated into university medical curricula under the &quot;Three Roads&quot; policy, wherein TCM, biomedicine and a synthesis of the two would all be encouraged and permitted to develop.

==Acupuncture in modern medicine==
Medical law in the [[United States]] regarding acupuncture varies widely from state to state. Notably, states furthest to the west ([[Hawaii]] most particularly, [[California]], etc.) have the most comprehensive laws and regulations regarding acupuncture.  In many U.S. states -- those furthest to the east -- medical doctors (M.D.s) are permitted to practice acupuncture with no specific training in acupuncture.  In some states, acupuncturists are required to work with an M.D. in a subservient relationship, even if the M.D. has no training in acupuncture.  Contrastingly, Hawaii forbids M.D.s to practice acupuncture unless they have received specific training in it and have demonstrated related competency.

Acupuncture is becoming accepted today.  Over fifteen million Americans in 1994 tried acupuncture.  In 1996, the [[FDA]] changed the status of acupuncture needles from Class III to Class II medical devices, meaning that needles are regarded as safe and effective when used appropriately by licensed practitioners [http://www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/596_upd.html] [http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pmapage.html].  Acupuncture is also in the curriculum of many colleges today.  

In Australia, the legalities of practicing acupuncture also vary by state. In 2000, an independent government agency was established to oversee the practice of Chinese Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture in the state of Victoria. The Chinese Medicine Registration Board of Victoria [http://www.cmrb.vic.gov.au/] aims to protect the public, ensuring that only apropriately experienced or qualified practitioners are registered to practice Chinese Medicine. The legislation put in place stipulates that only practitioners who are state registered may use the following titles: Acupuncture, Chinese Medicine, Chinese Herbal Medicine, Registered Acupuncturist, Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioner, Registered Chinese Herbal Medicine Practitioner. 

Warming an acupuncture point, typically by [[moxibustion]] (the burning of [[mugwort]]), is a different treatment than acupuncture itself and is often, but not exclusively, used as a supplementing treatment. The Chinese term zhēn jǐu (針灸), commonly used to refer to acupuncture, comes from ''zhen'' meaning &quot;needle&quot;, and ''jiu'' meaning &quot;moxibustion&quot;. Moxibustion is still used in the [[21st century|21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century]] to varying degrees among the schools of traditional Chinese medicine. For example, one well known technique is to insert the needle at the desired acupuncture point, attach dried mugwort to the external end of an acupuncture needle, and then ignite the mugwort. The mugwort will then smolder for several minutes (depending on the amount adhered to the needle) and conduct heat through the needle to the tissue surrounding the needle in the patient's body.

Most modern acupuncturists use disposable [[stainless steel]] needles of very fine [[diameter]] (approximately .015&quot;), sterilized with [[ethylene oxide]] or by [[autoclave]]. The upper third of these needles is wound with a thicker wire (typically bronze) to stiffen the needle, provide a handle for the acupuncturist to grasp while inserting the needle, and also provide a surface to which dried mugwort will more easily adhere.

==Theory==
Acupuncture treats the human body as a whole that involves several &quot;systems of function&quot; that are in many cases associated with (but not identified on a one-to-one basis with) physical organs. Some systems of function, such as the &quot;triple heater&quot; ([[San Jiao]], also called the &quot;triple burner&quot;) have no corresponding physical organ.  Disease is understood as a loss of homeostasis among the several systems of function, and treatment of disease is attempted by modifying the activity of one or more systems of function through the activity of needles, pressure, heat, etc. on sensitive parts of the body of small volume traditionally called &quot;acupuncture points&quot; in English, or &quot;xue&quot; (穴, cavities) in Chinese.

Treatment of acupuncture points may be performed along the twelve main or eight extra [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], located throughout the body. Of the eight extra meridians, only two have acupuncture points of their own. The other six meridians are &quot;activated&quot; by using a master and couple point technique which involves needling the acupuncture points located on the twelve main meridians that correspond to the particular extra meridian. Ten of the main meridians are named after organs of the body (Heart, Liver, etc.), and the other two are named after so called body functions (Heart Protector or [[Pericardium]], and ''San Jiao''). The two most important of the eight &quot;extra&quot; meridians are situated on the midline of the anterior and posterior aspects of the trunk and head.
The twelve primary meridians run vertically, bilaterally, and symmetrically and every channel corresponds to and connects internally with one of the twelve [[Zang Fu]] (&quot;organs&quot;).  This means that there are six [[yin]] and six [[yang]] channels. There are three [[yin]] and three [[yang]] channels on each arm, and three [[yin]] and three [[yang]] on each leg.

The three [[yin]] channels of the hand ([[Lung]], [[Pericardium]], and [[Heart]]) begin on the chest and travel along the inner surface (mostly the anterior portion) of the arm to the hand.

The three [[yang]] channels of the hand ([[Large intestine]], [[San Jiao]], and [[Small intestine]]) begin on the hand and travel along the outer surface (mostly the posterior portion) of the arm to the head.

The three [[yang]] channels of the foot ([[Stomach]], [[Gallbladder]], and [[Urinary bladder|Bladder]]) begin on the face, in the region of the eye, and travels down the body and along the outer surface (mostly the anterior and lateral portion) of the leg to the foot.

The three [[yin]] channels of the foot ([[Spleen]], [[Liver]], and [[Kidney]]) begin on the foot and travel along the inner surface (mostly posterior and medial portion)  of the leg to the chest or flank.

The movement of [[qi]] through each of the twelve channels is comprised of an internal and an external pathway.  The external pathway is what is normally shown on an acupuncture chart and it is relatively superficial.  All the acupuncture points of a channel lie on its external pathway.  The internal pathways are the deep course of the channel where it enters the body cavities and related Zang-Fu organs.  The superficial pathways of the twelve channels describe three complete circuits of the body.

The distribution of [[psuedoscience|energy]] through the meridians is said to be as follows:
Lung channel of hand [[taiyin]] to Large Intestine channel of hand [[yangming]] to Stomach channel of foot [[yangming]] to Spleen channel of foot [[taiyin]] to Heart channel of hand [[shaoyin]] to Small Intestine channel of hand [[taiyang]] to Bladder channel of foot [[taiyang]] to Kidney channel of foot [[shaoyin]] to Pericardium channel of hand [[jueyin]] to [[San Jiao]] channel of hand [[shaoyang]] to Gallbladder channel of foot [[shaoyang]] to Liver channel of foot [[jueyin]] then back to the Lung channel of hand [[taiyin]]

Traditional Chinese medical theory holds that acupuncture works by normalizing the balance of  ''[[qi]]'' &quot;vital energy&quot; throughout the body. Pain or illnesses are treated by attempting to remedy local or systemic accumulations or deficiencies of qi. Pain is considered to indicate blockage or stagnation of the flow of qi, and an axiom of the medical literature of acupuncture is &quot;no pain, no blockage; no blockage, no pain&quot;.

Many patients claim to experience the sensations of stimulus known in Chinese as &quot;deqi&quot; (得氣 &quot;obtaining the qi&quot;). This kind of sensation was historically considered to be evidence of effectively locating the desired point.  There are some electronic devices now available which will make a noise when what they have been programmed to describe as the &quot;correct&quot; acupuncture point is pressed.

The [[acupuncturist]] will decide which points to treat by thoroughly questioning the patient, and utilizing the diagnostic skills of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] which include observation of the left and right radial pulses at three levels of imposed pressure and analysis of the tongue coating, color and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge.

There are also theories being developed to explain effects observed for acupuncture within the orthodox Western medical paradigm.

According to the NIH consensus statement on acupuncture[http://consensus.nih.gov/1997/1997Acupuncture107html.htm]:
: Despite considerable efforts to understand the anatomy and physiology of the &quot;acupuncture points&quot;, the definition and characterization of these points remains controversial. Even more elusive is the basis of some of the key traditional Eastern medical concepts such as the circulation of [[Qi]], the meridian system, and the five phases theory, which are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information but continue to play an important role in the evaluation of patients and the formulation of treatment in acupuncture.

==An example of acupuncture practice==

[[Image:Acupuncture.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Acupuncture]]
In western medicine, vascular headaches (the kind that are accompanied by throbbing veins in the temples) are typically treated with analgesics such as aspirin and/or by the use of agents such as niacin that dilate the affected blood vessels in the scalp, but in acupuncture a common treatment for such headaches is to stimulate the sensitive points that are located roughly in the center of the webs between the thumbs and the palms of the patient, the ''hé gǔ'' points. These points are described by acupuncture theory as &quot;targeting the face and head&quot; and are considered to be the most important point when treating disorders affecting the face and head.  The patient reclines, and the points on each hand are first sterilized with alcohol, and then thin, disposable needles are inserted to a depth of approximately 3-5 mm until a characteristic &quot;twinge&quot; is felt by the patient, often accompanied by a slight twitching of the muscle between the thmb and hand.  Most patients report a pleasurable &quot;tingling&quot; sensation and feeling of relaxation while the needles are in place.  The needles are retained for 15-20 minutes while the patient rests, and then are removed. 

In the clinical practice of acupuncturists, patients frequently report one or more of certain kinds of sensation that are associated with this treatment, sensations that are stronger than those that would be felt by a patient not suffering from a vascular headache: (1) Extreme sensitivity to pain at the points in the webs of the thumbs. (2) In bad headaches, a feeling of nausea that persists for roughly the same period as the stimulation being administered to the webs of the thumbs. (3) Simultaneous relief of the headache. (See ''Zhen Jiu Xue'', p. 177f et passim.)

The [[Cochrane Collaboration]], an international organization dedicated to [[evidence-based medicine]], concluded from [[peer-reviewed]] research that &quot;(o)verall, the existing evidence supports the value of acupuncture for the treatment of idiopathic headaches. However, the quality and amount of evidence are not fully convincing. There is an urgent need for well-planned, large-scale studies to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture under real-life conditions.&quot; [http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001218.html].

==Indications and research==

In 1979, an interregional seminar in [[Beijing]] sponsored by [[World Health Organization]] drew up the following provisional list of diseases that lend themselves to acupuncture treatment. The list is based on clinical experience, and not necessarily on controlled clinical research: furthermore, the inclusion of specific diseases are not meant to indicate the extent of acupuncture's efficacy in treating them [http://www.aaom.org/default.asp?pagenumber=47494].

In [[1997]], the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] issued a [[Consensus (medical)|consensus statement]] on acupuncture that concluded that
:there is sufficient evidence of acupuncture's value to expand its use into conventional medicine and to encourage further studies of its physiology and clinical value[http://consensus.nih.gov/1997/1997Acupuncture107html.htm].

The NIH consensus statement noted that
: the data in support of acupuncture are as strong as those for many accepted Western medical therapies
and added that
:the incidence of adverse effects is substantially lower than that of many [[medication|drug]]s or other accepted medical procedures used for the same condition. For example, [[musculoskeletal]] conditions, such as [[fibromyalgia]], [[myofascial]] pain, and [[tennis elbow]]... are conditions for which acupuncture may be beneficial. These painful conditions are often treated with, among other things, [[Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory drug|anti-inflammatory medication]]s (aspirin, ibuprofen, etc.) or with [[steroid]] injections. Both medical interventions have a potential for deleterious side effects but are still widely used and are considered acceptable treatments.
Further,
: there is clear evidence that needle acupuncture is efficacious for adult postoperative and [[chemotherapy]] nausea and vomiting and probably for the nausea of pregnancy... There is reasonable evidence of efficacy for postoperative dental pain... reasonable studies (although sometimes only single studies) showing relief of pain with acupuncture on diverse pain conditions such as menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, and fibromyalgia...
However,
: acupuncture does not demonstrate efficacy for cessation of smoking and may not be efficacious for some other conditions.

In [[1999]], clinical researchers reported that inserting the fine needles into specific body points triggers the production of [[endorphin]]s [http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s27924.htm].

In 2005, researchers at [[Hull York Medical School]] reported the effect of acupuncture on perception of pain, noting that acupuncture led to a decrease in activity of part of the [[brain]]'s [[limbic system]] that is responsible for the body's awareness of pain. [http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article340079.ece]

The NIH consensus statement summarizes:
:Acupuncture as a therapeutic intervention is widely practiced in the United States. While there have been many studies of its potential usefulness, many of these studies provide equivocal results because of design, sample size, and other factors. The issue is further complicated by inherent difficulties in the use of appropriate controls, such as placebos and sham acupuncture groups. However, promising results have emerged, for example, showing efficacy of acupuncture in adult postoperative and chemotherapy nausea and vomiting and in postoperative dental pain. There are other situations such as addiction, stroke rehabilitation, headache, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, osteoarthritis, low back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and asthma, in which acupuncture may be useful as an adjunct treatment or an acceptable alternative or be included in a comprehensive management program. Further research is likely to uncover additional areas where acupuncture interventions will be useful.

==Criticisms==
One of the major criticisms of studies which purport to find acupuncture is anything more than a placebo is that most such studies are not properly conducted.  They are not double blinded and are not randomised.  However, since acupuncture is a procedure and not a pill, it is difficult if not impossible to design studies in which the person providing treatment is blinded as to the treatment being given.  The same problem arises in double-blinding procedures used in biomedicine, including virtually all surgical procedures, dentistry, physical therapy, etc.

The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] reports [http://www.cochrane.org/cochrane/revabstr/ab003527.htm] &quot;(t)here is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the use of acupuncture (either needle or laser) in the treatment of lateral elbow pain.&quot;  Oxford University reported [http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/alternat/AT008.html] &quot;There were no high quality trials of acupuncture for stroke that showed that it was beneficial.&quot;  Using stricter criteria (e.g., double-blinding) than those used in formulating the NIH consensus statement, the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] evaluated studies on acupuncture's efficacy in treating a number of conditions, usually but not always finding evidence to be lacking or inconclusive [http://sun21.imbi.uni-freiburg.de/cc_bin/mno?q=acupuncture&amp;ul=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2F&amp;m=all].

For the following conditions, the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] reports there is insufficient evidence that acupuncture is beneficial:

[http://www.cochrane.org/Cochrane/revabstr/AB000009.htm giving up smoking]

[http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab000008.html chronic asthma]

[http://www.cochrane.org/cochrane/revabstr/AB002914.htm bell's palsy]

[http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab005319.html shoulder pain]

[http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003317.html acute stroke]

[http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003788.html rheumatoid arthritis]

[http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab004046.html depression]

[http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001351.html low back pain]

[http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001218.html ideopathic headache](although the review recommended more research be done)

[http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab002962.html induction of labour]

However the Cochrane Collaboration reported some cases where acupuncture might be better than a placebo. For example: [http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003281.html &quot;P6 acupoint stimulation seems to reduce the risk of nausea but not vomiting after surgery.&quot;]

==Potential risks==
Some forms of acupuncture can be [[Invasive (medical)|invasive]], and therefore not without risk, although injuries are rare among patients treated by trained practitioners.  

[[Hematoma]] may result from accidental puncture of any [[circulatory]] structure.  [[Nerve]] injury can result from the accidental puncture of any nerve.  [[Brain damage]] or [[stroke]] is possible with very deep needling at the base of the skull.  Also rare but possible is [[pneumothorax]] from deep needling into the [[lung]], and [[kidney]] damage from deep needling in the low back.  Needling over an occult sternal foramen (an undetectable hole in the breastbone which can occur in up to 10% of people) may result in a potentially fatal haemopericardium.  

Certain acupuncture points have been shown to stimulate the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and oxytocin; these points are contraindicated for use on pregnant women to avoid inducing abortion or harming the fetus.

Needles that are not properly sterilized can transfer diseases such as [[HIV]] and [[hepatitis]]. 

Sometimes, when treating pain or using acupuncture as an anesthetic, a mild electrical current is applied to the needles. This stimulates the nerve cells in the area of the needles so that they become depleted of the chemicals needed to transmit signals. Prolonged stimulation of nerve cells in this way can cause irreversible damage.

Severe injury from acupuncture is extremely rare, but not unheard-of.  

The NIH consensus panel made the following statement about the risks associated with acupuncture: “Adverse side effects of acupuncture are extremely low and often lower than conventional treatments.  In a UK study of almost 2000 practitioners covering over 34,000 treatments, there were no serious adverse events and only 43 minor adverse events [http://www.medical-acupuncture.co.uk/journal/2001(2)/093.shtml].

Most acupuncturists in the USA use sterile one-time-use needles. Some still use reusable needles and an autoclave but this practice is declining due to its cost, time and the possibility of failure in sterilizing the needles.

==Acupuncture accreditation and controls==
In many countries anyone can call himself an acupuncturist, there are no legal requirements with regard to training and education, nor are licensing boards regulated in any way, making it very hard to assess the actual value of licenses and training of acupuncturists. 

In the USA the [http://www.nccaom.org/aboutus.htm National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine] tests practitioners to ensure they are knowledgeable about Chinese medicine. Many states require this test for licensing, but each state has its own laws and requirements.

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved acupuncture needles for use by licensed practitioners in 1996. The FDA requires that sterile, nontoxic needles be used and that they be labeled for single use by qualified practitioners only.[http://nccam.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/#safe]

In the United Kingdom, British Acupuncture Council (BAcC) members observe the Code of Safe Practice which lays down stringent standards of hygiene and sterilisation for other equipment - members use single-use pre-sterilised disposable needles, which are permanently withdrawn from service after being used in treatment.  Similar standards apply in most jurisdictions in the United States and Australia.

'''Adder''' is another name for the [[viper]]. Most snakes called '''adders''' belong to the family Viperidae, more precisely to subfamily viperinae (by contrast to [[pit vipers]]). An exception is the Australian [[Death adder]], which despite its name is not a viperid at all, but rather a member of the cobra family, Elapidae.

''[[Etymology]]'': The word was ''nædre'' in [[Old English]], which developed into ''nadder'' or ''naddre''; in the 14th century ''a nadder'' was, like ''a napron'', reinterpreted as ''an adder''. It appears with the generic meaning of [[snake|serpent]] in the older forms of many Germanic languages, including [[Old High German]] ''natra'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''nadrs''. It is thus used in the Old English version of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Scriptures]] for the devil, the ''serpent'' of [[Genesis]]. The Old English word ''nædre'' is assumed to derive in turn from the [[Old Norse]] word [[eitr]], synonymous with [[snake poison]].

[[Image:BarocciAeneas.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Aeneas flees burning Troy'', [[Federico Barocci]], [[1598]].]] 

'''Aeneas''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Αινείας, ''Aineías'') was a [[Troy|Trojan]] hero, the son of prince [[Anchises]] and the goddess [[Aphrodite]] ([[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] in Roman sources). He was also the cousin of King [[Priam]] of Troy. The journey of Aeneas from Troy, which led to the founding of the city that would one day become [[Rome]], is recounted in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. He is considered an  important figure in [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Rome|Roman]] legend and history. Aeneas is a character in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''.

== Legend ==
In the ''Iliad'', Aeneas is the leader of the [[Dardan]]s (allies of the Trojans), and a principal lieutenant of [[Hector]], son of the Trojan king [[Priam]]. In the poem, Aeneas's mother [[Aphrodite]] frequently comes to his aid on the battlefield: he is also a favorite of [[Apollo]]. Even [[Poseidon]], who normally favors the Greeks, comes to Aeneas's rescue when the latter falls under the assault of [[Achilles]], noting that Aeneas, though from a junior branch of the royal family, is destined to become king of the Trojan people.

When Troy was [[looting|sacked]] by the Greeks, Aeneas gathered a group, collectively known as the [[Aeneads]], traveled to [[Italy]] and became a progenitor of the [[Roman Kingdom|Romans]]. The Aeneads included his trumpeter [[Misenus]], his father [[Anchises]], his friends [[Achates]], [[Sergestus]] and [[Acmon]], the healer [[Iapyx]], his son [[Ascanius]], and their guide [[Mimas]]. He carried with him the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]], the statues of the household gods of Troy, and transplanted them to [[Italy]]. 

[[Image:Pierre-Narcisse Guérin 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Aeneas tells Dido about the fall of Troy, by Pierre-Narcisse Guérin.]]

During his journey, Aeneas and his fleet made landfall at [[Carthage]]. It is at this point that the poem of the ''Aeneid'' begins. Aeneas had a brief affair with the [[Carthaginian]] queen Elissa, also known as [[Dido]], who proposed that the Trojans settle in her land and that she and Aeneas reign jointly over their peoples. However, the messenger god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] was sent by [[Jupiter]] and Venus to remind Aeneas of his journey and his purpose, thus compelling him to leave secretly and continue on his way. When Dido learned of this, she ordered a funeral pyre to be constructed for herself; and standing on it, she uttered a famous curse that forever would pit Carthage against the Trojans. She then committed suicide by stabbing herself in the chest. When Aeneas later traveled to [[Hades]], he called to her ghost but she neither spoke or acknowledged him.

The company stopped on the island of [[Sicily]] during the course of their journey. There Aeneas was welcomed by [[Acestes]], king of the region and son of the river [[Crinisus]] by a [[Dardania]]n woman. When the ship left, [[Achaemenides]], one of [[Odysseus]]' crew who had been left behind, traveled with them.  

Soon after arriving in Italy, Aeneas made war against the city of [[Falerii]]. [[Latinus]], king of the [[Latin]]s, welcomed Aeneas's army of exiled [[Trojan War|Trojans]] and let them reorganize their life in [[Latium]]. His daughter [[Lavinia]] had been promised to [[Turnus]], king of the [[Rutuli]], but Latinus received a prophecy that Lavinia would be betrothed to one from another land &amp;mdash; namely, Aeneas. Latinus heeded the prophecy, and Turnus consequently declared war on Aeneas at the urging of [[Juno_(mythology)|Juno]], who was aligned with King [[Tarchon]] of [[Etruscan civilization|the Etruscans]] and Queen [[Amata]] of the [[Latins]]. Aeneas' forces prevailed, and Turnus was killed.  Aeneas founded the of city [[Lavinium]], named after his wife. He later welcomed Dido's sister, [[Anna Perenna]], who then committed suicide after learning of Lavinia's jealousy. 
 
After his death, his mother, [[Aphrodite]] asked [[Zeus]] to make her son immortal. [[Zeus]] agreed and the river god [[Numicius]] cleansed Aeneas of all his mortal parts and [[Aphrodite]] anointed him with Ambrosia and Necar, making him a god. Aeneas was recognized as the god [[Indiges]]. Inspired by the work of [[James Frazer]], some have posited that Aeneas was originally a [[life-death-rebirth]] deity.

== Family and legendary descendants ==
Aeneas had an extensive [[Aeneas's family tree|family tree]]. Aeneas' [[wet-nurse]] was named [[Caieta]]. He was the father of [[Ascanius]] with [[Creusa]], and of [[Silvius]] with Lavinia. [[Ascanius]], the son of Aeneas, also known as [[Iulus]] (or Julius), founded [[Alba Longa]] and was the first in a long series of kings.

According to the mythology outlined by Virgil in the ''Aeneid,'' [[Romulus and Remus]] were both descendants of Aeneas through their mother, and thus Aeneas was responsible for founding the Roman people. Some early sources call him their father or grandfather [http://www.4literature.net/Plutarch/Romulus/], but, considering the commonly accepted dates of the fall of Troy ([[1184 BC]]) and the founding of [[Rome]] ([[753 BC]]), this seems unlikely.

The Julian family ([[Gens Julia]]) of Rome, whose most famous member was [[Julius Caesar]], traced their lineage to Aeneas's son Ascanius and, in turn, to the goddess Venus.

The legendary [[King of the Britons|kings of Britain]] also trace their family through a grandson of Aeneas, [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]].

The '''amaranths''' (also called '''pigweeds''') comprise the [[genus]] '''''Amaranthus''''', a widely distributed genus of short-lived [[herb]]s, occurring mostly in temperate and tropical regions.  Although there remains some confusion over the detailed taxonomy, there are about 60 ''Amaranthus'' species.  Several of them are cultivated as [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[cereal]]s, or [[ornamental plant]]s.

Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus ''[[Celosia]]''.

==Cultivation and uses==
Several species are raised for '''amaranth grain''' in [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]].  Amaranth grain is a crop of moderate importance in the [[Himalaya]].  It was one of the staple foodstuffs of the [[Inca]]s, and it is known as '''kiwicha''' in the [[Andes]] today. It was also used by the ancient [[Aztec]]s, who called it '''huautli''', and other Amerindian peoples in [[Mexico]] to prepare ritual drinks and foods. To this day, amaranth grains are toasted much like [[popcorn]] and mixed with [[honey]] or [[molasses]] to make a treat called ''alegría'' (literally &quot;joy&quot;) in [[Mexican Spanish]].

Amaranth was used in several Aztec ceremonies, where images of their gods (notably [[Huitzilopochtli]]) were made with amaranth mixed with honey. The images were cut to be eaten by the people. This looked like the [[Christian]] [[eucharist|communion]] to the [[Catholic]] priests, so the cultivation of the grain was forbidden for centuries.

Because of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, and because it is very palatable, easy to cook, and its protein particularly well suited to human [[nutrition]]al needs, interest in [[Amaranth grain|grain amaranth]] (especially ''A. cruentis'' and ''A. hypochondriaca'') was revived in the [[1970s]].  It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated.   It is a popular snack sold on almost every block of [[Mexico City]], sometimes mixed with [[chocolate]] or [[puffed grain|puffed rice]], and its use has spread to [[Europe]] and [[North America]].  Besides [[protein]], [[Amaranth grain|amaranth grain]] provides a good source of [[dietary fiber]] and [[dietary mineral]]s such as [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[phosphorus]], [[copper]], and especially [[manganese]].

'''Amaranth greens''', also called '''Chinese spinach''', '''hinn choy''' or '''yin tsoi''' ({{zh-sp|s=苋菜|p=xiàncài}}), '''callaloo''', '''tampala''', or '''quelite''', are a common leaf vegetable throughout the tropics and in many warm temperate regions.  They are a very good source of [[vitamin]]s including [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin B6]], [[vitamin C]], [[riboflavin]], and [[folate]], and dietary minerals including [[calcium]], [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], and [[manganese]].  However their moderately high content of [[oxalic acid]] inhibits the absorption of calcium, and also means that they should be avoided or eaten in moderation by people with [[kidney]] disorders, [[gout]], or [[rheumatoid arthritis]].

The flowers of the Hopi Red Dye amaranth were used by the Hopi Indians as the source of a deep red dye. This dye has been supplanted by a coal tar dye known as [[Red No. 2]] in North America and E123 in the [[European Economic Community|E.E.C.]], also known as amarynth.

The genus also contains several well-known ornamental plants, such as ''A. caudatus'' (love-lies-bleeding), a native of [[India]] and a vigorous, hardy annual with dark purplish [[flower]]s crowded in handsome drooping spikes. Another Indian annual, ''A. hypochondriacus'' (prince's feather), has deeply-veined lance-shaped leaves, purple on the under face, and deep crimson flowers densely packed on erect spikes.

Amaranths are recorded as food plants for some [[Lepidoptera]] species including [[Nutmeg (moth)|The Nutmeg]] and various case-bearers of the genus ''[[Coleophora]]'': ''C. amaranthella'', ''C. enchorda'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. immortalis'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. lineapulvella'' and ''C. versurella'' (recorded on ''A. spinosus'').

== Myth, legend and poetry ==
'''Amaranth''', or Amarant (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''amarantos'', unwithering), a name chiefly used in poetry, and applied to Amaranth and other plants which, from not soon fading, typified immortality. Thus, in [[John Milton|Milton's]] [[Paradise Lost]], iii. 353:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:&quot;Immortal amarant, a flower which once 
:In paradise, fast by the tree of life,
:Began to bloom; but soon for man's offence
:To heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows,
:And flowers aloft, shading the fount of life,
:And where the river of bliss through midst of heaven
:Rolls o'er elysian flowers her amber stream:
:With these that never fade the spirits elect
:Bind their resplendent locks.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The progessive metal band, Opeth, refers to Amaranth in the extent of immortallity in the song Blackrose Immortal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:&quot;Lullaby of the crescent moon took you
:Mesmerized, its kaleidoscopic face
:Granted you a hollow stare
:Another soul within the divine herd
:I have kept it
:The amaranth symbol
:Hiddin inside the golden shrine
:Until we rejoice in the meadow
:Of the end
:When we both walk the shadows
:It will set ablaze and vanish
:Black rose immortal&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The original spelling is ''amarant''; the more common spelling ''amaranth'' seems to have come from a [[folk etymology]] assuming that the final syllable derives from the Greek word ''anthos'' (&quot;flower&quot;), common in botanical names. 

In ancient [[Greece]] the amaranth (also called chrusanthemon and elichrusos) was sacred to Ephesian [[Artemis]]. It was supposed to have special healing properties, and as a symbol of 
immortality was used to decorate images of the gods and tombs. In legend, [[Amarynthus]] (a form of Amarantus) was a hunter of Artemis and king of [[Euboea]]; in a village of Amarynthus, of which he was the eponymous hero, there was a famous temple of Artemis Amarynthia or Amarysia (Strabo x. 448; Pausan. i. 31, p. 5).

''Amaranth'' is also the name of the otherworldly pantheon that amuses itself by toying with individuals' luck in [[Tim Lebbon]]'s novella &quot;The Unfortunate&quot;.

&quot;Amaranth&quot; is also the name of a long [[Sapphic]] poem by the great [[imagiste]] [[H.D.]], and is based on [[Sappho]]'s fragment 131.

In [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf Game Studio]]'s [[Vampire: The Dark Ages]] [[book]]s and [[role-playing game]]s, ''Amaranth'' is the medieval name of what then was widely known as ''[[Diablerie]]'' (consuming the blood and soul of another vampire).

''Amarantine'' is the name of a 2005 album and single by Irish vocal artist [[Enya]].

&quot;Love-Lies-Bleeding&quot; is the title of a 2005 play by [[Don DeLillo]].

The '''African lily''' (''Agapanthus umbellatus'') is a member of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Alliaceae]] and a native of the [[Cape of Good Hope]], from where it was introduced to [[Europe]] at the close of the [[17th century]].

== Description ==

The African lily has a short stem bearing a tuft of long, narrow, arching leaves 1/2 to 2 ft. long and a central flower stalk 2 to 3 ft. high, ending in an umbel of bright blue, funnel-shaped flowers.

Several cultivars are known, such as albidus (white flowers), aureus (leaves striped with yellow), and variegatus (leaves almost entirely white with a few green bands). There are also double-flowered and larger- and smaller-flowered forms.

== Cultivation ==

The African lily is a handsome greenhouse plant and is hardy in the south of [[England]] and [[Ireland]] if protected from severe frosts. The plants are easy to cultivate and (in areas that have winter) are generally grown in large pots or tubs that can be protected from frost.

During the summer they require plenty of water and are very effective on the margins of lakes or by running streams, where they thrive.

== Propagation ==

They may be propagated from offsets or by dividing the rootstock in early spring or autumn.

[[Image:MaskeAgamemnon.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The so-called '[[Mask of Agamemnon]]'. Discovered by [[Heinrich Schliemann]] in [[1876]] at [[Mycenae]].]]

'''Agamémnon''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: '''{{polytonic|Ἀγαμέμνων}}''') (&quot;very resolute&quot;), one of the most distinguished heroes of [[Greek mythology]], was the son of King [[Atreus]] of [[Mycenae]] (or [[Argos]]) and Queen [[Aerope]], and brother of [[Menelaus]]. 
==Early life==
Agamemnon's father Atreus was murdered by [[Aegisthus]], who took possession of the throne of Mycenae and ruled jointly with his father [[Thyestes]]. During this period Agamemnon and Menelaus took refuge with [[Tyndareus]], king of [[Sparta]]. There they respectively married Tyndareus' daughters [[Clytemnestra]] and [[Helen]].  Agamemnon and Clytemnestra had four children: three daughters, [[Iphigeneia]], [[Electra]], and [[Chrysothemis]], and one son, [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]].  

Menelaus succeeded Tyndareus in Sparta, while Agamemnon, with his brother's assistance, drove out Aegisthus and Thyestes to recover his father's kingdom. He extended his dominion by conquest and became the most powerful prince in Greece.  

However, Agamemnon's family history, dating back to legendary king [[Pelops]], had been marred by [[rape|pederastic rape]], [[murder]], [[incest]], and [[treachery]]. The Greeks believed this violent past brought misfortune upon the entire [[House of Atreus]].

==The Trojan War==
[[Image:300px-Iphigenia.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The sacrifice of [[Iphigenia]].]]

Agamemnon gathered together the Greek forces to sail for Troy. Preparing to depart from [[Aulis]], a port in [[Boeotia]], Agamemnon's army incurred the wrath of the goddess [[Artemis]] by slaying an animal sacred to her, and by Agamemnon boasting that he was Artemis' equal in hunting.  Misfortunes including a plague and a lack of wind prevented the army from sailing; finally, the prophet [[Calchas]] announced that the wrath of the goddess could only be propitiated by the sacrifice of [[Iphigeneia]] (daughter of Agamemnon). Classical dramatizations differ on how willing either father or daughter were to this fate, but Agamemnon did eventually sacrifice Iphigenia. Her death appeased Artemis and the Greek army set out for Troy. Several alternatives to the human sacrifice have been presented in Greek mythology. Other sources claim Agamemnon was prepared to kill his daughter, but Artemis accepted a deer in place of Iphigenia, and whisked her to Taurus in the [[Crimea]]. [[Hesiod]] said she became the goddess [[Hecate]].

Agamemnon was the commander-in-chief of the Greeks during the [[Trojan War]]. During the fighting, Agamemnon killed [[Antiphus]]. Agamemnon's teamster, [[Halaesus]], later fought with [[Aeneas]] in [[Italy]]. The ''[[Iliad]]'' tells the story of the quarrel between Agamemnon and [[Achilles]] in the final year of the war.  Agamemnon took an attractive slave and spoil of war [[Briseis]] from Achilles. [[Achilles]], the greatest warrior of the age, withdrew from battle in revenge and nearly cost the Greek armies the war.

Although not the equal of [[Achilles]] in bravery, Agamemnon was a dignified representative of kingly authority.  As commander-in-chief, he summoned the princes to the council and led the army in battle. He took the field himself, and performed many heroic deeds until he was wounded and forced to withdraw to his tent. His chief fault was his overweening [[haughtiness]]. An over-exalted opinion of his position led him to insult [[Chryses]] and [[Achilles]], thereby bringing great disaster upon the Greeks.  

After the capture of Troy, [[Cassandra]], doomed prophetess and daughter of [[Priam]], fell to his lot in the distribution of the prizes of war.

==Return to Greece==
[[Image:The Return Of Agamemnon - Project Gutenberg eText 14994.png|thumbnail|right|300px|The return of Agamemnon, from an [[1879]] illustration from ''Stories from the Greek Tragedians'' by [[Alfred Church]].]]

[[Image:The Murder Of Agamemnon - Project Gutenberg eText 14994.png|thumbnail|right|300px|The murder of Agamemnon, from an 1879 illustration from ''Stories from the Greek Tragedians'' by Alfred Church]]

After a stormy voyage, Agamemnon and Cassandra landed in [[Argolis]] or were blown off course and landed in Aegisthus' country. Aegisthus, who in the interval had seduced Clytemnestra, invited him to a banquet at which he was treacherously slain. According to the account given by [[Pindar]] and the tragedians, Agamemnon was slain by his wife alone in a bath, a piece of cloth or a net having first been thrown over him to prevent resistance.  Clytemnestra also killed Cassandra. Her wrath at the sacrifice of Iphigenia, and her jealousy of Cassandra, are said to have been the motives of her crime. Aegisthus and Clytemnestra then ruled Agamemnon's kingdom for a time, but the murder of Agamemnon was eventually avenged by his son [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] (possibly with the help of Electra).

==Other stories==
[[Athenaeus]] tells a story of [[Argynnus]], an [[eromenos]] of Agamemnon: &quot;Agamemnon loved Argynnus, so the story goes, having seen him swimming in the [[Cephisus]] river; in which, in fact, he lost his life (for he constantly bathed in this river), and Agamemnon buried him and founded there a temple of [[Aphrodite]] Argynnis.&quot; (The Deipnosophists of Athenaeus of Naucratis; Book XIII Concerning Women, p.3) This episode is also found in [[Clement of Alexandria]] (Protrepticus II.38.2) and in [[Stephen of Byzantium]] ''(Kopai'' and ''Argunnos),'' with minor variations.
 
The fortunes of Agamemnon have formed the subject of numerous [[tragedy|tragedies]], ancient and modern, the most famous being the [[Oresteia]] of [[Aeschylus]]. In the legends of the [[Peloponnesus]], Agamemnon was regarded as the highest type of a powerful monarch, and in [[Sparta]] he was worshipped under the title of ''Zeus Agamemnon''. His tomb was pointed out among the ruins of [[Mycenae]] and at [[Amyclae]].

Another account makes him the son of [[Pleisthenes]] (the son or father of [[Atreus]]), who is said to have been Aerope's first husband.  

In works of art there is considerable resemblance between the representations of [[Zeus]], king of the gods, and Agamemnon, king of men. He is generally characterized by the [[sceptre]] and [[diadem]], the usual attributes of kings.

==Agamemnon in modern fiction and film==
Modern writers of time travel and historical novels often attempt to show the Trojan War &quot;as it really happened&quot;, based on the archeological evidence of [[Mycenaean]] civilization. Such authors frequently use Agamemnon as the archetypical Mycenaean king, bringing life to old artifacts by dressing a familiar face in them. Of particular interest is [[S. M. Stirling]]'s time-travel trilogy ''[[Island in the Sea of Time]]'', ''[[Against the Tide of Years]]'' and ''[[On the Oceans of Eternity]]'', where the fate that befalls the House of Atreus is every bit as horrific as that portrayed in traditional myth. The horror is arranged by a time-travelling villain who is very well aware of the mythology. 

Agamemnon is also said to have been the ancient [[ancestor]] or relative of the [[nobility|noble]] [[family]] the [[Atreides]] of the [[classic]] [[science fiction]]  series ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' by [[Frank Herbert]] (Note that the surname, [[Atreides]] is derived from Agamemnon's father's name, ''[[Atreus]]''). There are many [[parallels]] with the story of Agamemnon and in Dune, such as with the [[protagonist]] [[Paul Atreides]] in that both are [[Tragic hero|tragic heroes]]. 

Agamemnon makes an appearance in the film ''[[Time Bandits]]'', played by [[Sean Connery]], although his depiction in the film seems more reminiscent of [[Odysseus]].

He also appeared in the 2004 film ''[[Troy (movie)|Troy]]'', played by [[Scotland|Scottish]] actor [[Brian Cox]].

Agamemnon was the name of the Earth fleet Destroyer that John Sheridan commanded near the end of season 4 of Babylon 5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aga Khan I''' ({{lang-ar|أغا خان}})

([[1800]]-[[1881]]), was the title accorded by general consent to '''Hasan Ali Shah''' (born in [[Iran|Persia]], [[1800]]), when, in early life, he first settled in [[Bombay]] under the protection of the [[United Kingdom|British]] government. He was believed to have descended in direct line from [[Ali Ben Abu Talib|Ali]] by his wife [[Fatima Zahra]], the daughter of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]. Ali's son, Husain, having married a daughter of one of the rulers of Persia before the time of Muhammad, the Aga Khan traced his descent from the royal house of [[Iran|Persia]]  from the most remote, almost prehistoric, times. His ancestors had also ruled in [[Egypt]] as ''[[caliphs]]'' of the [[Fatimids|Fatimid]] dynasty for a number of years, at the same time as the [[Crusade|Crusades]].

Before the Aga Khan emigrated from Persia, he was appointed by the emperor [[Fateh Ali Shah]] to be [[governor-general]] of the extensive and important province of [[Kerman]]. His rule was noted for firmness, moderation and high political sagacity, and he succeeded for a long time in retaining the friendship and confidence of his master the Shah, although his career was beset with political intrigues and jealousy on the part of rival and court favourites, and with internal turbulence. At last, however, the fate usual to statesmen in oriental countries overtook him, and he incurred the mortal displeasure of Fateh. He fled from Persia and sought protection in British territory, preferring to settle down eventually in [[India]], making Bombay his headquarters. At that period the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] was at its height, and in crossing over from Persia through [[Afghanistan]] the Aga Khan found opportunities of rendering valuable services to the British army, and thus cast in his lot forever with the British. A few years later he rendered similar conspicuous services in the course of the [[Sindh]] campaign, when his help was utilized by [[Charles James Napier]] in the process of subduing the frontier tribes, a large number of whom acknowledged the Aga's authority as their spiritual head. Napier held his Muslim ally in great esteem, and entertained a very high opinion of his political acumen and chivalry as a leader and soldier. The Aga Khan reciprocated the British commander's confidence and friendship by giving repeated proofs of his devotion and attachment to the British government, and when he finally settled down in India, his position as the leader of the large [[Ismailis|Ismaili]] section of Muslim British subjects was recognized by the government, and the title of His Highness was conferred on him, with a large pension.  

From that time until his death in 1881 the Aga Khan, while leading the life of a peaceful and peacemaking citizen, under the protection of British rule, continued to discharge his sacerdotal functions, not only among his followers in India, but towards the more numerous communities which acknowledged his religious sway in distant countries, such as Afghanistan, [[Khorasan]], Persia, [[Arabia]], [[Central Asia]], and even distant [[Syria]] and [[Morocco]]. He remained throughout unflinchingly loyal to the [[British Raj]], and by his vast and unquestioned influence among the frontier tribes on the northern borders of India he exercised a control over their unruly passions in times of trouble, which proved of invaluable service in the several expeditions led by British arms on the northwest frontier of India. He was also the means of checking the fanaticism of the more turbulent Muslims in British India, which in times of internal troubles and misunderstandings finds vent in the shape of religious or political riots. 

He was succeeded by his eldest son, '''[[Aga Khan II]]'''. This prince continued the traditions and work of his father in a manner that won the approbation of the local government, and earned for him the distinction of a knighthood of the [[Order of the Indian Empire]] and a seat in the legislative council of Bombay.
