He wrote, apparently about the year 1143, a [[chronicle]] entitled ''Annales sive Historia de gestis regum Britanniae'',  which begins with [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] and carries the history of [[England]] down to 1129.  

[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] and [[Simeon of Durham]] are Alured's chief sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autpert Ambrose (Ambroise)''' (d. [[778]]), was a [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Benedictine]] monk.

He became abbot of San Vicenzo on the Volturno in South Italy in the time of [[Desiderius]], king of the [[Lombards]].  Autpert's election as [[abbot]] caused internal dissent at St. Vicenzo, and both [[Pope Stephen III]] and [[Charlemagne]] intervened.  The disagreement was based both on objections to Autpert's personality and to his Frankish origin.

He wrote a considerable number of works on the Bible and religious subjects generally. Among these are commentaries on the [[Apocalypse]], on the [[Psalms]], and on the [[Song of Solomon]]; Lives of Saints Paldo, Tuto and Vaso; [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] of the Virgin; and a ''Combat between the Virtues and the Vices''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Islam}}
:''For the entry on Persian philosopher Abū Bakr Muhammad Ibn Zakarīya al-Rāzi, see [[Al-Razi]].''

'''Abu Bakr''' ({{lang-ar|&amp;#1575;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1608; &amp;#1576;&amp;#1603;&amp;#1585;}}, alternative spellings, '''Abubakar''', '''Abi Bakr''', '''Abu Bakar''') (''ca''. [[573]] &amp;ndash; [[August 23]], [[634]]) ruled as the first of the [[Muslim]] [[caliph]]s ([[632]] &amp;ndash; [[634]]).

==Early life==
Abu Bakr was born in [[Mecca]] (Makkah), a [[Quraish]]i of the [[Banu Taim]] clan. According to early Muslim historians, he was a [[merchant]], and highly esteemed as a [[judge]], as an interpreter of [[dream]]s, and as one learned in Meccan traditions. He was one of the last people anyone would have expected to convert to the faith preached by his kinsman [[Muhammad]]. Yet he was one of the [[Identity of first male Muslim | first converts]] to [[Islam]]  and instrumental in converting many of the Quraish and the residents of Mecca.

Originally called ''Abd-ul-Ka'ba'' (&quot;servant of the [[Kaaba]]&quot;), on his conversion he assumed the name of ''Abd-Allah'' (servant of God). However, he is usually styled ''Abu Bakr'' (from the Arabic word ''bakr'', meaning a young [[camel]]) due to his interest in raising camels. [[Sunni]] Muslims also honor him as Al-Siddiq (&quot;the truthful&quot;).  His full name was '''Abd-Allah ibn Abi Quhaafah'''.

==During the lifetime of Muhammad==
Abu Bakr was one of Muhammad's companions. When Muhammad fled from Mecca in the [[migration to Medina]] of [[622]], Abu Bakr alone accompanied him. Abu Bakr was also linked to Muhammad by marriage: Abu Bakr's daughter [[Aisha]] married Muhammad soon after the migration to [[Medina]]. He was a trusted lieutenant, high in Muhammad's councils.

==Rise to the Caliphate==
During the prophet's last illness, it is said by some traditions that Muhammad allowed Abu Bakr to lead prayers in his absence, and that many took this as an indication that Abu Bakr would succeed Muhammad. Soon after the latter's death (on [[8 June]] [[632]]), a gathering of prominent ''[[Ansar]]'' and some of the ''[[Muhajirun]]'', in Medina, acclaimed Abu Bakr as the new Muslim leader or ''[[caliph]]''. What happened at this meeting, called [[Saqifah]], is much disputed. 

Abu Bakr's assumption of power is an extremely controversial matter, and the source of the first [[schism]] in Islam, between [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam]]. Shi'a believe that Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]], was his designated successor, while Sunnis believe that Muhammad deliberately declined to designate a successor. They argue that Muhammad endorsed the traditional Arabian method of ''[[shura]]'' or ''consultation'', as the way for the community to choose leaders. Designating one's successor was the sign of kingship, or ''[[mulk]]'', which the independence-minded tribesmen disliked. Whatever the truth of the matter, Ali gave his formal ''[[bay'ah]]'', or submission, to Abu Bakr and to Abu Bakr's two successors. (The Sunni depict this ''bay'ah'' as enthusiastic, and Ali as a supporter of Abu Bakr and [[Umar]]; the Shi'a argue that Ali's support was only ''pro forma'', and that he effectively withdrew from public life in protest). The Sunni/Shi'a schism did not erupt into open warfare until much later. Many volumes have been written on the affair of the succession. A detailed treatment can be found at [[Succession to Muhammad]].

==The Ridda Wars==
Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr's succession, threatening the unity and stability of the new community and state. Various Arab tribes of [[Hejaz]] and [[Nejd]] rebelled against the ''caliph'' and the new system. Some withheld the ''[[zakat]]'', the alms tax, though they did not challenge the prophecy of Muhammad. Others [[apostatize]]d outright and returned to their pre-Islamic religion and traditions, classified by Muslims as [[idolatry]]. The tribes claimed that they had submitted to Muhammad and that with Muhammad's death, their allegiance was ended. Abu Bakr insisted that they had not just submitted to a leader but joined the Muslim religious community, of which he was the new head. Apostasy is a capital offense under traditional interpretations of [[Islamic law]], and Abu Bakr declared war on the rebels. This was the start of the ''[[Ridda wars]]'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for the Wars of [[Apostasy]]. The severest struggle was the war with [[Ibn Habib al-Hanefi]], known as &quot;Musailimah the Liar&quot;, who claimed to be a prophet and Muhammad's true successor. The Muslim general [[Khalid bin Walid]] finally defeated al-Hanefi at the [[Battle of Akraba]].

==Expeditions to the north==

After suppressing internal dissension and completely subduing [[Arabia]], Abu Bakr directed his generals towards the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] empires. Khalid bin Walid conquered [[History of Iraq|Iraq]] in a single campaign, and a successful expedition into [[History of Syria|Syria]] also took place. [[Fred Donner]], in his book ''The Early Islamic Conquests'', argues that Abu Bakr's &quot;foreign&quot; expeditions were merely an extension of the Ridda Wars, in that he sent his troops against Arab tribes living on the borders of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. Given that the [[steppe]]s and [[desert]]s over which [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking tribes roamed extended without break from southern Syria down to [[Yemen]], any polity that controlled only the southern part of the steppe was inherently insecure.

==The ''Qur'an''==

Some traditions about the origin of the ''Qur'an'' say that Abu Bakr was instrumental in preserving Muhammad's revelations in written form. It is said that after the hard-won victory over Musailimah, [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] (the later ''Caliph'' Umar), saw that many of the Muslims who had memorized the ''Qur'an'' from the lips of the prophet had died in battle. Abu Bakr asked Umar to oversee the collection of the revelations. The record, when completed, was deposited with [[Hafsa bint Umar]], daughter of Umar, and one of the wives of Muhammad. Later it became the basis of [[Uthman ibn Affan]]'s definitive text of the ''Qur'an''. However, other historians give Uthman the principal credit for collecting and preserving the ''Qur'an''. Shi'as strongly refute the idea that Abu Bakr or Umar had anything to do with the collection or preservation of the ''Qur'an''.

==Death==
Abu Bakr died on [[August 23]], [[634]] in [[Medina]]. Shortly before his death, likely of natural causes (one tradition ascribes it to [[poison]]), he urged the Muslim community to accept [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] as his successor. The community did so, without serious incident. However, this succession is also a matter of controversy. Shi'a Muslims believe that the leadership should have been assumed by Ali ibn Abu Talib, without any recourse to shura (consultation). 

Abu Bakr initially served without pay. His followers insisted that he take an official stipend. At his death, his will returned all these payments to the treasury (''Age of Faith'', Durant, p. 187).

Abu Bakr lies buried in the [[Masjid al Nabawi]] mosque in Medina, alongside Muhammad and Umar ibn al-Khattab.

==First man to adopt Islam?==
Muslim scholars agree that the first woman to adopt Islam was [[Khadijah]], Muhammad's first wife. However, there is some disagreement over the identity of  the first male to convert. Some Muslim historians have claimed that it was Abu Bakr, or perhaps Muhammad's adopted son Zayd ibn Harithah. Shi'a Muslims, as well as some other Muslim historians, believe that the first male convert (after Muhammad) was Ali ibn Abi Talib. This matter is discussed at greater length in [[Identity of first male Muslim]].

==Shia view==
:''{{Main|Shia view of Abu Bakr}}

Shi'as believe that Abu Bakr, far from being a devout Muslim and wise and humble man, was a schemer who seized the Islamic state for himself, displacing the proper heir, Ali. They believe that Abu Bakr and Umar persecuted Ali, his family, and his followers, and in so doing, caused the death of Ali's wife and Muhammad's daughter, [[Fatima Zahra]], and her unborn child, [[Al Muhsin]]. For a fuller discussion, see [[Succession to Muhammad]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ambrose the Camaldulian,''' (Ambrogio Traversari) ([[1386]]-[[1439]]), was a [[theology|theologian]], born near [[Forlì]] at the village of Portico di [[Romagna]].

At the age of fourteen he entered the [[Camaldulian]] Order in the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli, and rapidly became a leading theologian and Hellenist. In Greek literature his master was [[Manuel Chrysoloras|Emmanuel Chrysoloras]]. He became general of the order in 1431, and was a leading advocate of the [[papacy]].
This attitude he showed clearly when he attended the [[Council of Basel]] as legate of [[Pope Eugenius IV]].
So strong was his hostility to some of the delegates that he described Basel as a western [[Babylon]]. He likewise supported the pope at [[Ferrara]] and Florence, and worked hard in the attempt to reconcile the Eastern and Western Churches.

Though this cause was unsuccessful, Ambrose is interesting as typical of the new humanism which was growing up within the church. Thus while among his own colleagues he seemed merely a hypocritical and arrogant priest, in his relations with his brother humanists, such as [[Cosimo de Medici]], he appeared as the student of classical antiquities and especially of Greek theological authors.

His chief works are: -- ''Hodoeporicon'', an account of a journey taken at the pope's command, during which he visited the monasteries of Italy; translations of [[Palladius]]' ''Life of Chrysostom;'' of ''Nineteen Sermons of Ephraem Syrus''; of the St Basil ''On Virginity.''  A number of his manuscripts remain in the library of St Mark at Venice.

He died on [[October 20]] [[1439]].

Only the oldest of the Catholic Ambrosians, the Fratres S. Ambrosii ad Nemus, had anything more than a very local significance. This order is known from a bull of [[Pope Gregory XI]] addressed to the [[monk]]s of the church of St Ambrose outside Milan.

Saint Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, certainly did not found religious orders, though he took an interest in the monastic life and watched over its beginnings in his diocese, providing for the needs of a monastery outside the walls of Milam, as Saint Augustine recounts in his ''Confessions''. Ambrose also made successful efforts to improve the moral life of women in the Milan of his time by promoting the permament institution of Virgins, as also of widows. His exhortations and other interventions have survived in various writings: ''De virginibus'', ''De viduis'', ''De virginitate'', ''De institutione virginis'', ''De exhortatione virginitatis'', and ''De lapsu virginis consecratae''. Ambrose was the only Father of the Church to leave behind so many writings on the subject and his attentions naturally enough led to the formation of  communities which later became formal monasteries of women. 

It is against this background that two religious orders or congregations, one of men and one of women, when founded in the Milan area during the [[13th century|13th]] and [[15th century|15th centuries]], took Saint Ambrose as their patron and hence adopted his name.
 
===The Order of St Ambrose=== 
The first of these groups was formed in a wood outside Milan by three noble Milanese, Alexander Grivelli, Antonio Petrasancta, and Albert Besuzzi, who were joined by others, including some  priests. In [[1375]] [[Pope Gregory XI]] gave them the Rule of St Augustine, with set of constitutions. As a canonically recognized order they took the name &quot;Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus&quot; and adopted a habit consisting of a brown tunic, scapular, and hood. The brethren elected a superior with the title of prior who was then instituted by the Archbishop of Milan. The priests of the congregation undertook preaching and other tasks of the ministry but were not allowed to accept charge parishes. In the liturgy they followed the [[Ambrosian Rite]]. Various monasteries were founded on these lines, but without any formal bond between them. In [[1441]] [[Pope Eugene IV]] merged them into one congregation called &quot;Congregatio Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus&quot;, made the original house the main seat, and laid down a system of government whereby a general chapter met every three years, elected the priors who stayed in office till the next chapter. There was a rector, or superior general, who was assisted by two &quot;visitors&quot;.

Saint Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, successfully reformed their discipline, grown lax, in [[1579]]. In [[1589]] [[Pope Sixtus V]] united to the Congregation of St Ambrose the monasteries of a group known as the &quot;Brothers of the Apostles of the Poor Life&quot; (or  &quot;Apostolini&quot; or &quot;Brothers of St. Barnabas&quot;), whose houses were in the province of Genoa and in the March of Ancona. This was an order that had been founded by Giovanni Scarpa at the end of the [[15th century]]. The union  was confirmed by [[Pope Paul V]] in [[1606]], at which time the congregation added the name of St. Barnabas to its title, adopted new constitutions, divided its houses into four provinces, two of them, St Clement's and St Pancras's, being in Rome. Published works have survived from the pen of Ascanio Tasca and Michele Mulozzani, each of whom was superior-general, and of Zaccaria Visconti, Francesco-Maria Guazzi and Paolo Fabulotti. Although various Ambrosians were given the title of Blessed in recognition of their holiness: Antonio Gonzaga of Mantua, Filippo of Fermo, and Gerardo of Monza, the order was eventually dissolved by [[Pope Innocent X]] in [[1650]]. 

===Ambrosian Nuns===
The Nuns of St Ambrose (Ambrosian Sisters) wore a habit of the same colour as the Brothers of St Ambrose, conformed to their constitutions, and followed the [[Ambrosian Rite]], but were independent in government. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] gave the nuns canonical status in [[1474]]. Their one monastery was on the top of Monte Varese, near Lago Maggiore, on the spot where their foundress, the Blessed Catarina Morigia (or Catherine of Palanza), had first led a solitary life.  Other early nuns were the Blessed Juliana of Puriselli, Benedetta Bimia, and Lucia Alciata. The nuns were esteemed by St Charles Borromeo. 

Another group of cloistered &quot;Nuns of St Ambrose&quot;, also called the Annunciatae (Italian: ''Annunziate'') of Lombardy or &quot;Sisters of St Marcellina&quot;, were founded in [[1408]] by three young women of Pavia, Dorothea Morosini, Eleonora Contarini, and Veronica Duodi. Their houses, scattered throughout Lombardy and Venetia, were united into a congregation by St Pius V, under the Rule of St Augustine with a mother-house, residence of the prioress general, at Pavia. One of the nuns in this group was Saint Catharine Fieschi Adorno, who died on [[September 14]], [[1510]].


===The [[Oblates of St Ambrose and of St Charles]]===
In some sense also &quot;Ambrosians&quot; are the members of a diocesan religious society founded by St Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan. All priests or destined to become priests, they took a simple vow of obedience to their bishop. The model for this was a society that already existed at Brescia, under the name of &quot;Priests of Peace&quot;. In August [[1578]] the new society was inaugurated, being entrusted with the church of the Holy Sepulchre and given the name of &quot;Oblates of St. Ambrose.&quot; They later received the approbation of Gregory XIII. St Charles died in [[1584]]. These Oblates were dispersed by [[Napoleon I]] in 1810, while another group called the Oblates of Our Lady of Rho escaped this fate. In 1848 they were reorganized and given the name of &quot;Oblates of St. Charles&quot; and reassigned the house of the Holy Sepulchre. In the course of the [[19th century]] similar groups were founded in a number of countries, including the &quot;Oblates of St Charles&quot;, established in London by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ambrosiaster''', a commentary on St [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]'s epistles, &quot;brief in words but weighty in matter,&quot; and valuable for the criticism of the [[Latin]] text of the [[New Testament]], was long attributed to St [[Ambrose]].

[[Erasmus]] in 1527 threw doubt on the accuracy of this ascription, and the author is usually spoken of as Ambrosiaster or pseudo-Ambrose. Because [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] cites part of the commentary on [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] as by &quot;Sanctus Hilarius&quot; it has been ascribed by various critics at different times to almost every known Hilary. Dom G. Morin (''Rev. d'hist. et de litt. religieuses'', tom. iv. 97 f.) broke new ground by suggesting in 1899 that the writer was Isaac, a converted Jew, writer of a tract on the Trinity and Incarnation, who was exiled to [[Spain]] in 378-380 and then relapsed to [[Judaism]], but he afterwards abandoned this theory of the authorship in favour of [[Decimus Hilarianus Hilarius]], proconsul of [[North Africa during the Classical Period|Africa]] in 377.

With this attribution Professor Alex. Souter, in his ''Study of Ambrosiaster'' (Cambridge Univ.  Press, 1905), agrees. There is scarcely anything to be said for the possibility of Ambrose having written the book before he became a bishop, and added to it in later years, incorporating remarks of [[Hilary of Poitiers]] on Romans. The best presentation of the case for Ambrose is by P. A. Ballerini in his complete edition of that father's works. 

In the book cited above Professor Souter also discusses the authorship of the ''Quaestiones Veteris et Novi Testamenti,'' which the manuscripts ascribe to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. He concludes, on very thorough [[philology|philological]] and other grounds, that this is with one possible slight exception the work of the same &quot;Ambrosiaster.&quot; The same conclusion had been arrived at previously by Dom Morin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ambrosius Aurelianus''' (incorrectly referred to in the ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' as '''Aurelius Ambrosius ''') was a leader of the [[Romano-British]], who won important battles against the [[Anglo-Saxons]] in the [[5th century]], according to [[Gildas]] and to the legends preserved in the ''[[Historia Britonum]]''. According to the Annal ''Chronicon Maiora'' Ambrosius came to power in [[479]]. Some scholars have speculated that he was the leader of the Romano-British at the [[Battle of Mons Badonicus]] and as such may have become a [[historical basis for King Arthur]].

== Aurelianus according to Gildas ==
Ambrosius Aurelianus is one of the few people Gildas identifies by name in his sermon [[Gildas#De Excidio Britanniae|De Excidio Britanniae]]. Following the destructive assault of the Saxons, the survivors gather together under the leadership of Ambrosius, who is described as &quot;a gentleman who, perhaps alone of the Romans, had survived the shock of this notable storm. Certainly his parents, who had worn the purple, were slain in it. His descendants in our day have become greatly inferior to their grandfather's [''avita''] excellence.&quot; According to Gildas, Ambrosius organised the survivors into an armed force, and achieved the first military victory over the Saxon invaders. However, this victory was not decisive: &quot;Sometimes the Saxons and sometimes the citizens [meaning the Romano-British inhabitants] were victorious.&quot; 

Two points in this brief description have attracted much scholarly commentary. The first is what Gildas meant by saying Ambrosius' parents &quot;had worn the purple&quot;: does this mean that Ambrosius was related to one of the [[Roman Emperors]], perhaps the [[House of Theodosius]] or a usurper like [[Constantine III (usurper)|Constantine III]]? The second question is the meaning of the word ''avita'': does it mean &quot;ancestors&quot;, or did Gildas intend it to mean more specifically &quot;grandfather&quot; — thus indicating Ambrosius lived about a generation before the Battle of [[Mons Badonicus]]? The lack of information for this period prevents us from decisively answerering these questions.

== Other accounts of Aurelianus ==
The ''Historia Britonum'' preserves several snippets of lore about Ambrosius. The most significant of these is the story about Ambrosius, [[Vortigern]], and the two dragons beneath [[Dinas Emrys]] 'Fortress of Ambrosius' in Chapters 40&amp;ndash;42.  This story was later retold with more detail by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his fictional ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', conflating the personage of Ambrosius with the Welsh tradition of [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] the visonary, known for oracular utterances that foretold the coming victories of the native [[Celt]]ic inhabitants of Britain over the [[Saxons]] and the [[Normans]].

But there are smaller snippets of tradition preserved in ''Historia Brittonum'': in Chapter 31, we are told that Vortigern ruled in fear of Ambrosius; later, in Chapter 66, various events are dated from a battle of Guoloph (often identified with Wallop, 15km ESE of [[Amesbury]] near [[Salisbury, England|Salisbury]]), which is said to have been between Ambrosius and Vitolinus;  lastly, in Chapter 48, it is said that Pascent, the son of Vortigern, was granted rule over the kingdoms of [[Buellt]] and [[Gwrtheyrion]]. It is not clear how these various traditions relate to each other or that they come from the same tradition, and it is very possible that these references are to a different Ambrosius. The ''Historia Brittonum'' dates the battle of Guoloph to 439, forty to fifty years before the battles that Gildas says were commanded by Ambrosius Aurelianus.

Because Ambrosius and Vortigern are shown in the ''Historia Brittonum'' as being in conflict, some historians have suspected that this preserves a historical core of the existence of two parties in opposition to one another, one headed by Ambrosius, and the other by Vortigern. J.N.L. Myres built upon this suspicion and put forth the hypothesis that belief in [[Pelagianism]] reflected an actively provincial outlook in Britain, and that Vortigern represented the Pelagian party, while Ambrosius led the Catholic one. Some later historians accepted this hypothesis as fact, and have created a narrative of events in  fifth-century Britain with various degrees of elaborate detail. Yet a simpler alternative interpretation of this conflict between these two figures is that the ''Historia Brittonum'' is preserving traditions hostile to the purported descendants of Vortigern, who at this time were a ruling house in [[kingdom of Powys|Powys]]. This interpretation is supported by the negative character of all of the stories retold about Vortigern in the ''Historia Brittonum'', which include his alleged practice of [[incest]].

Ambrosius Aurelianus appears in later pseudo-chronicle tradition beginning with [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''Historiae Regum Britanniae'' with the slightly garbled name ''Aurelius Ambrosius'', now presented as son of a King Constantine. When King Constantine's eldest son Constans is murdered at Vortigern's instigation, the two remaining sons, Ambrosius and Uther, still very young, are quickly hustled into exile in [[Brittany]]. (Note that this does not fit with Gildas' account in which Ambrosius' family perished in the turmoil of the Saxon uprisings.) Later, when Vortigern's power has faded, the two brothers return from exile with a large army, destroy Vortigern and become friends with Merlin. The Welsh possibly had traditions of two different Ambrosianii, whom Geoffrey of Monmouth confused.

In Welsh Ambrosius appears as ''Emrys Wledig''. In [[Robert de Boron]]'s ''Merlin'' he is called simply ''Pendragon'' and his younger brother is named ''Uter'', a name which Uter changes after the death of Pendragon to ''Uterpendragon''. This is probably a confusion that entered oral tradition from [[Robert Wace|Wace]]'s ''Brut''. Wace usually only refers to ''li roi'' 'the king' without naming him and someone has taken an early mention of Uther's epithet ''Pendragon'' as the name of his brother.

S. Appelbaum has suggested that [[Amesbury]] in [[Wiltshire]] might preserve in it the name of Ambrosius, and perhaps Amesbury was the seat of his power base in the later fifth century.  Place name scholars have found a number of [[Toponymy|place names]] through the Midland dialect regions of Britain with placenames incorporating the ''ambre-'' element: [[Ombersley]] in [[Worcestershire]], [[Ambrosden]] in [[Oxfordshire]], Amberley in [[Herefordshire]], and Amberley in [[Gloucestershire]]. These scholars have claimed this element rerpresents an [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''amor'', the name of a woodland bird. However, [[Amesbury]] in Wiltshire is in a different dialect region, and does not easily fit into the pattern of the Midland dialect place names. This makes Appelbaum's suggestion more likely. If we combine this etymology with the tradition reported by Geoffrey of Monmouth stating Ambrosius Aurelianus ordered the building of [[Stonehenge]] &amp;mdash; which is located within the parish of Amesbury (and where Ambrosius was supposedly buried) &amp;mdash; and with the presence of an [[Iron age]] [[hill fort]] also in that parish, then it is extremely tempting to connect this shadowy figure with Amesbury.

== Aurelianus in fiction ==
In [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', Aurelianus is depicted as the aging High King of Britain, a &quot;too-ambitious&quot; son of a Western Roman Emperor. His sister's son is Uther Pendragon, but somehow, Uther is described as not having any Roman blood in him. Strangely, Aurelianus is unable to gather the leadership of the native Celts, who refuse to follow any but their own race.

In [[Stephen R. Lawhead]]'s ''[[Pendragon Cycle]]'', Ambrosius Aurelianus (referred to as &quot;[[Aurelius]]&quot;) is a minor character, being assassinated soon after becoming [[High King]] of [[Prydein]]. Lawhead alters the standard Arthurian story somewhat, in that he has Aurelius marry [[Igraine]] and become the true father of [[King Arthur]].

In [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]]'s ''[[The Last Legion]]'', Aurelianus is a major character that is shown as the last loyal Roman that goes to enormous lengths for his boy emperor [[Romulus Augustus]] , whose power has been wrested by the barbarian [[Odoacer]]. In this story [[Romulus Augustus]] marries [[Igraine]], and ''[[Caliban]]'', the sword of [[Julius Caesar]], becomes the legendary [[Excalibur]] in Britain.

In [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s ''[[The Lantern Bearers (Sutcliff novel)|The Lantern Bearers]]'' Prince Ambrosius Aurelianus drives out the Saxons by training his British army with Roman techniques and making effective use of cavalry.  By the end of the novel, the elite cavalry wing is led by a dashing young warrior prince named Artos, who Sutcliff postulates to be the real Arthur.

[[Mary Stewart]]'s ''The Crystal Cave'' follows Geoffrey of Monmouth in calling him Aurelius Ambrosius and portrays him as the father of Merlin, the elder brother of Uther (hence uncle of Arthur), an initiate of [[Mithras]], and generally admired by everyone except the Saxons. Much of the book is set at his court in Brittany or during the campaign to retake his throne from Vortigern. Later books in the series show that Merlin's attitude toward Arthur is influenced by his belief that Arthur is a reincarnation of Ambrosius, who is seen through Merlin's eyes as a model of good kingship.

Judging by his situation (a Romano-British living in post-Roman Britain and fighting Mons Badonicus), the titular character from the 2004 movie ''[[King Arthur (2004 movie)|King Arthur]]'' was based on Aurelianus, despite the fact that his name ([[Lucius Artorius Castus|Artorius Castus]]) comes from another historical source for Arthur.

'''Amun''' (also spelt '''Amon''', '''Amoun''', '''Amen''', and rarely '''Imenand''', and spelt in [[Greek language|Greek]] as '''Ammon''', and '''Hammon''') was the name of a [[deity]], in [[Egyptian mythology]], who gradually rose to become one of the most important deities, before fading into obscurity.

{{Hiero|Amun|&lt;hiero&gt;i-mn:n-C12&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
==God of Air==
Originally, he was simply nothing more than a deification of the concept of air, and thus [[wind]], one of the four fundamental concepts held to have composed the primordial universe, in the [[Ogdoad]] [[cosmogeny]], whose cult was strongest in [[Hermopolis]]. His name reflects this function, since it means ''the hidden one'', reflecting the invisibility of the air, and of the wind. Like all other members of the Ogdoad, his male aspect was usually depicted as a frog, or frog-headed. Symbolically, invisibility was represented by the [[colour]] [[blue]], since it was the colour of the [[sky]], seen through the air, and so this was the colour usually given to Amun's image.

As with the other concepts in the Ogdoad, he was dualistically considered to have a female aspect, referred to as '''[[Amunet]]''' (also spelt '''Amentet''', '''Amentit''', '''Imentet''', '''Imentit''', '''Amaunet''', and '''Ament'''), which was simply the [[feminine]] form of the word ''Amun''. The other female aspects of the Ogdoad were all depicted as snakes, thus Amunet was depicted likewise.

==Creator==
[[Image:Amon and mut.png|170px|thumb|left|Amun and Mut]]

Gradually, as god of air, he came to be associated with the ''breath of life'', which created the [[Egyptian soul|ba]], particularly in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. By the [[First Intermediate Period]] this had led to him being thought of, in these areas, as the creator god, titled ''father of the gods'', preceding the Ogdoad, although also part of it. As he became more significant, he was assigned a wife (Amunet being his own female aspect, more than a distinct wife), and since he was the creator, his wife was considered the divine mother from which the cosmos emerged, who in the areas where Amun was worshipped was, by this time, [[Mut]].

Amun became depicted in [[human]] form, seated on a throne, wearing on his head a plain deep circlet from which rise two straight parallel plumes, possibly symbolic of the tail [[feather]]s of a [[bird]], a reference to his earlier status as a wind god. 

Having become more important than [[Menthu]], the local [[war]] [[god]] of Thebes, Menthu's authority became said to exist because he was the son of Amun. However, as Mut was infertile, it was believed that she, and thus Amun, had adopted Menthu instead. In later years, due to the shape of a [[pool]] outside the sacred temple of Mut at Thebes, Menthu was replaced, as their adopted son, by [[Chons]], the [[lunar deity|moon god]].

==King==
[[Image:Amun5.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bas-relief depicting Amun as king.]]
With the eviction of the [[Hyksos]] rulers from Egypt, by the [[army|armies]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]], Thebes, where the victors were based, became the most important city, and so Amun became nationally important. To Amun the [[Pharaoh]]s attributed all their successful enterprises, and on his temples they lavished their wealth and captured spoil. And so, when the Greeks reported back on their [[tourism|visits]] to Egypt, Amun, as king of the gods, became identified by the Geeks with [[Zeus]], and so his consort [[Mut]] with [[Hera]].

As the Egyptians considered themselves opressed during he period of Hyksos rule, the victory under the supreme god Amun, was seen as his championing of the [[underdog]]. Consequently, Amun was viewed as upholding the rights to justice of the poor, being titled ''[[Vizier]] of the poor'', and aiding those who travelled in his name,as the ''Protector of the road''. Since he upheld [[Ma'at]], those who prayed to Amun were required first to demonstrate that they were worthy, by confessing their sins.

==Fertility God==
[[image:Chem.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Amun-Min]]
When, subsequently, Egypt conquered [[Kush]], they identified the chief deity of the Kushites as Amun. This deity was depicted as [[Ram]] headed, specifically a [[wool]]ly Ram with curved [[horn (anatomy)|horns]], and so Amun started becoming associated with the Ram. Indeed, due to the aged appearance of it, they came to believe that this had been the original form of Amun, and that Kush was where he had been born.

However, since rams, due to their [[rutting]], were considered a symbol of [[virility]], Amun became thought of as a fertility deity, and so started to absorb the identity of [[Min (god)|Min]], becoming ''Amun-Min''. This association with virility lead to ''Amun-Min'' gaining the [[epithet]] ''Kamutef'', meaning ''Bull of his mother'', in which form he was often found depicted on the walls of [[Karnak]], [[ithyphallic]], and with a [[scourge]].

==Sun God==
{{Hiero|Amun-Ra|&lt;hiero&gt;i-mn:n-ra:Z1-C1&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=left|era=egypt}}
As Amun's cult grew bigger, Amun rapidly became identified with the chief God that was worshipped in other areas, ''Ra-Herakhty'', the merged identities of [[Ra]], and [[Horus]]. This identification led to a merger of identities, with Amun becoming ''Amun-Ra''. As [[Ra]] had been the father of [[Shu]], and [[Tefnut]], and the remainder of the [[Ennead]], so Amun-Ra was likewise identified as their father.

Ra-Herakhty had been a [[solar deity|sun god]], and so this became true of Amun-Ra as well, Amun becoming considered the ''hidden'' aspect of the sun (e.g. during the night), in contrast to Ra-Herakhty as the ''visible'' aspect, since Amun clearly meant ''the one who is hidden''. This complexity over the sun led to a gradual movement towards the support of a more pure form of deity. Thus the pharaoh, [[Akhenaten|Amenhotep IV]] introduced the worship of [[Aten]], the sun's [[disc]] itself, identifying it as Amun-Ra.

Although [[Atenism]], the worship of Aten, had started out as standard [[henotheism]], it very quickly became, for reasons that are not very clear, entirely [[monotheism|monotheistic]]. Indeed, it is even possible that this is the first instance of monotheism in the world. Subsequently, Amenhotep IV started persecuting the worship of Amun, and erased the name from monuments, even changing his own name to [[Akhenaten]] in favour of Aten. 

However, this abrupt change was unpopular, particularly with the previous [[priesthood]]s, who had now suddenly found themselves without power. Consequently, when Akhenaten died, his name was struck out, and all his changes undone, almost as if they had not occurred. The correct form of mentioning about Akhenaten were figures akin to 'crazy one from Akhetaten'. Worship of Aten was replaced, and that of Amun-Ra restored. The priests persuaded the new underage pharaoh [[Tutankhaten]] (most likely Akhenaten's son), the &quot;live image of  Aten&quot;,  to change his name to [[Tutankhamun]], the &quot;live image of Amun&quot;.

==Decline==
After the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth dynasty]] moved the centre of power back to Thebes, the powerbase of Amun's cult had been renewed, and the authority of Amun began to stack. Under the [[Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first dynasty]] the secondary line of priest kings of Thebes upheld his dignity to the best of their power, and the [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second]] favoured Thebes. 

As the sovereignty weakened the division between Upper and Lower Egypt asserted itself, and thereafter Thebes would have rapidly decayed had it not been for the piety of the kings of [[Nubia]] towards Amun, whose worship had long prevailed in their country.  Thebes was at first their Egyptian capital, and they honoured Amun greatly, although their wealth and culture were not sufficient to affect much.

However, in the rest of Egypt, his cult was rapidly overtaken, in popularity, by the less divisive cult of the [[Legend of Osiris and Isis]], which had not been associated with Akhenaten's actions. And so there, his identity became first subsumed into Ra (''Ra-Herakhty''), who still remained an identifiable figure in the [[Osiris]] cult, but ultimately, became merely an aspect of [[Horus]].

In areas outside of Egypt, where the Egyptians had previously brought the worship of Amun, Amun's fate was not as bad. In Nubia, where his name was pronounced '''Amane''', he remained the national god, with his priesthoods at [[Meroe]] and [[Nobatia]], via an [[oracle]], regulating the whole government of the country, choosing the king, and directing his military expeditions. According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], they were even able to compel kings to commit suicide, although this behaviour stopped when [[Arkamane]], in the [[3rd century BC]], [[slaughter|slew]] them.

Likewise, in [[Libya]], there remained an oracle of Amun in [[Libyan Desert|the desert]], at the [[oasis]] of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]]. Such was its reputation among the Greeks that [[Alexander the Great]] journeyed there, after the [[battle of Issus]], and during his occupation of Egypt, in order to be acknowledged the son of the god. Even during this occupation, Amun, identified as a form of [[Zeus]], continued to be the great god of Thebes, in its decay.

==Derived Terms==

Several words derive from Amun via the Greek form Ammon: [[ammonia]] and [[ammonite]]. Ammonia, as well as being the chemical, is a genus name in the [[foraminifera]]. Both these foraminiferans (shelled [[Protozoa]]) and ammonites (extinct shelled [[cephalopod]]s) have/had spiral shells resembling a ram's, and Ammon's, horns.  Ammonia the chemical derives its name in a more round-about way &amp;ndash; see end of article [[ammonia]]. The regions of the [[hippocampus]] in the [[brain]] are called the ''[[cornu ammonis]]'' &amp;ndash; literally &quot;Amun's Horns&quot;, due to the horned appearance of the dark and light bands of [[cell (biology) | cellular]] layers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ammon''' or '''Ammonites''' ('''&amp;#1506;&amp;#1463;&amp;#1502;&amp;#1468;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1465;&amp;#1503;''' &quot;People&quot;, [[Standard Hebrew]] '''&amp;#699;Ammon''', [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''&amp;#699;Ammôn'''), also referred to in the [[Bible]] as the &quot;children of Ammon,&quot; were a people living east of the [[Jordan river]], who along with the [[Moabites]] traced their origin to [[Lot (biblical)|Lot]], the nephew of the patriarch [[Abraham]], and who were regarded as close relatives of the [[Israelites]] and [[Edomites]].  

==Territory==

The borders of the Ammonite territory are not clearly defined in the Bible. In [[Book of Judges|Judges]] xi. 13, the claim of the king of Ammon, who demands of the Israelites the restoration of the land &quot;from [[Arnon]] even unto [[Jabbok]] and unto [[Jordan River|Jordan]],&quot; is mentioned only as an unjust claim (xi. 15), inasmuch as the Israelite part of this tract had been conquered from the [[Amorite]] king [[Sihon]] who had, in turn, displaced the Moabites; in Judges xi. 22 it is stated that the Israelites had possession &quot;from the wilderness even unto Jordan,&quot; and that they laid a claim to territory beyond this, so as to leave no room for Ammon. The [[Book of Numbers]] xxi. 24 describes the Hebrew conquest (compare Judges, xi. 19) as having reached &quot;even unto the children of Ammon, for the border of the children of Ammon was [[Jazer]]&quot; (read the last word, with [[Septuagint]], as &quot;Jazer,&quot; instead of &quot;'az,&quot; strong, A. V.; compare Judges, xi. 32). Josh. xiii. 25, defines the frontier of the tribe of Gad as being &quot;Jazer ... and half the land of the children of Ammon.&quot; The latter statement can be reconciled with Num. xxi. 24 (Deut. ii. 19, 37) only by assuming that the northern part of Sihon's Amorite kingdom had formerly been Ammonite. This explains, in part, the claim mentioned above (Judges, xi. 13). According to Deut. ii. 37, the region along the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill-country formed the border-line of Israel. On the authority of Deut. ii. 20, their territory had formerly been in the possession of a mysterious nation, the Zamzummim (also called Zuzim), and the war of [[Chedorlaomer]] (Gen. xiv. 5) with this nation may be connected with the history of Ammon. When the Israelites invaded Canaan, they passed by the frontier of the Ammonites (Num. xxi. 24; Deut. ii. 19, 37; Josh. xiii. 25).

From their original territory the Ammonites are supposed to have been expelled by [[Sihon]], king of the [[Amorites]], who was said to have been found by the Israelites, after their deliverance from [[Egypt]], in possession of [[Gilead]], that is, of the whole country on the left bank of the Jordan, lying to the north of the Arnon ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 21:13). By this invasion, the Ammonites were driven out of Gilead across the upper waters of the Jabbok where it flows from south to north, which henceforth continued to be their western boundary (Numbers 21:24; Deuteronomy 2:37 and 3:16). The other limits of the Ammonitis, or country of the Ammonites ('Lmmanitis chora', [[2 Maccabees]] 4:26) were not exactly defined.  On the south it probably adjoined the land of Moab; on the north it may have met that of the king of [[Geshur]] ([[Joshua]] 12:5); and on the east it may have melted away into the desert peopled by [[Kedarites]] and other nomadic tribes. 

The chief city of the country was ''[[Rabbah]]'' or ''Rabbath Ammon'', i.e. the metropolis of the Ammonites (Deut. 3:11), called ''Rabbathammana'' by the later [[Greeks]] ([[Polybius]] v. 7. 4).  [[Ptolemy Philadelphus]] changed its name to Philadelphia, and made it a large and strong city with an [[acropolis]], situated on both sides of a branch of the Jabbok, today known as Nahr `Amman, the river of Ammon -- whence the designation &quot;city of waters&quot; ([[2 Samuel]] 12:27); see Survey of E. Pal (Pal. Explor. Fund), pp. 19ff. The city of [[Amman, Jordan]] is located on roughly the same site. The country to the south and east of Amman is distinguished by its fertility; and ruined towns are scattered thickly over it, attesting that it was once occupied by a population that, however fierce, was settled and industrious; a fact indicated also by the tribute of grain paid annually to [[Jotham of Judah|Jotham]] (2 Chr. 27:5).

==In the [[Torah]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]]==

===Descent===

According to the pedigree given in [[Genesis]] xix. 37-38, the Ammonites were closely related to the Israelites and still more closely to their neighbors in the south, the Moabites. This relationship is supported by the fact that all names of Ammonitish persons show a pure [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] character. But the above passage indicates also the contempt and hatred for the Ammonites felt by the Hebrews ([[Deuteronomy]] xxiii. 4). The Torah excludes the progeny of Ammonites from the assembly of the Lord (but cf. Deut. ii. 19, 37, in which the consciousness of relationship seems to be at the root of the regard shown to Ammon).

Both the Ammonites and Moabites are sometimes spoken of under the common name of the children of Lot ([[Deuteronomy]] 2:19; [[Psalms]] 83:8).  Both tribes hired [[Balaam]] to curse [[Israel]], which he instead blessed (Deut. 23:4).  Also known as the ''Beni-ammi'' ([[Genesis]] 19:38), the Ammonites and the Israelites, throughout the Old Testament and recorded history, were antagonists.

===Role in the Israelite Exodus===

When the Israelites of the Exodus paused before their territory, the Ammonites prohibited them from passing through their lands. For this act, they were denied entry into &quot;the congregation of the Lord&quot; until ten generations had passed (Deuteronomy 23:3). 

Sometimes a slight distinction only seems to be made between the Ammonites and their southern brothers, the Moabites. Deut. xxiii. 4, 5, for instance, states that the Ammonites and Moabites hired [[Balaam]] to curse the Israelites, while in Num. xxii. 3 et seq. Moab alone is mentioned. Some authorities overcome this discrepancy by the help of the emended text of Num. xxii. 5, according to which Balaam came &quot;from the land of the children of Ammon.&quot; This is the reading of most ancient versions; the Septuagint, however, has it like the present Hebrew text: &quot;the children of his people&quot; (&quot;ammo&quot;) (see Balaam). 

===In the time of the Judges===

In Judges, iii. 13, the Ammonites appear as furnishing assistance to King [[Eglon]] of Moab against Israel; but in Judges, x. 7, 8, 9, in which not only Gilead is oppressed but a victorious war is waged also west of the Jordan, Ammon alone is mentioned. The speech of Jephthah which follows, however, is clearly addressed to the Moabites as well, for he speaks of their god [[Chemosh]] (Judges, xi. 18-24). Some scholars find that these varying statements conflict (compare Deut. xxiii. 3); others conclude that the brother-nations still formed a unit. The small nation of Ammon could face Israel only in alliance with other non-Israelites (compare II Chron. xx. and Ps. lxxxiii. 7). The attack of King [[Nahash]] upon the frontier city Jabesh in Gilead was easily repulsed by Saul (I Sam. xi., xiv. 47).

==During the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Israel|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]==

Attacks by the Ammonites on Israelite communities east of the Jordan were the impetus behind the unification of the tribes under [[Saul the King|Saul]], who defeated them. ([[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 11:11). 

From II Sam. x. 2, it may be concluded that [[Nahash]] assisted David out of hatred for Saul; but his son [[Hanun]] provoked David by ill-treating his ambassadors, and brought about the defeat of the Ammonites, despite assistance from their northern neighbors in [[Aram]] (ibid. x. 13). Their capital Rabbah was captured (ibid. xii. 29), and numerous captives were taken from &quot;all the cities of the children of Ammon.&quot; 

In 2 Samuel 12:31, King David is described slaughtering Ammonites:
:''And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under [[axe]]s of iron, and made them pass through the [[brick]]-[[kiln]]: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon.''
 
David's treatment of the captives (ibid. xii. 31) was not necessarily barbarous; the description may be interpreted to mean that he employed them as laborers in various public works. Some scholars claim that these passages recount symbolic gestures of submission common to the times rather than actual reports of massacres. The Chronicler, however, takes it in the most cruel sense (I Chron. xx. 3). The Ammonites, themselves, had a reputation for exceeding cruelty in warfare (I Sam. xi. 2; [[Amos]], i. 13). The new king, [[Shobi]], a brother of Hanun, evidently appointed by David, kept peace, his attitude being even friendly (II Sam. xvii. 27). There were Ammonite [[mercenaries]] in David's army (ibid. 23, 27) and Solomon's chief wife, the mother of his heir, was Naamah, the Ammonitess (I Kings, xiv. 21; compare xi. 1), probably a daughter of Shobi. She became the mother of [[Rehoboam]] ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 14:31; [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 12:13).

After this, hostilities again broke out, under [[Jehoshaphat]] (II Chron. xx.), [[Jeroboam II]] (Amos, i. 13) and under [[Jotham]], who subjected the Ammonites (II Chron. xxvii. 5).

From the [[Assyria|Assyrian]] inscriptions, we learn that the Ammonite king [[Baasha ben Ruhubi| Ba'sa (Baasha)]] son of [[Ruhubi]], with 1000 men, joined [[Ahab]] and the Syrian allies against [[Shalmaneser III]] at the [[Battle of Karkar]] in [[853 BC]]. They may at this time have been [[vassal]]s of [[Bar-Hadad II]], the Aramaean king of [[Damascus]]. In [[734 BC|734]] their king [[Sanipu]] was a vassal of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] and his successor, [[Pudu-ilu]], held the same position under [[Sennacherib]] and [[Esarhaddon]]. An Assyrian [[tribute]]-list from this period, showing that Ammon paid one-fifth of Judah's tribute, gives evidence of the scanty extent and resources of the country (see Schrader, &quot;K.A.T.&quot; pp. 141 et seq.; Delitzsch, &quot;Paradies,&quot; p. 294; Winckler, &quot;Geschichte Israels,&quot; p. 215).

Somewhat later, their king [[Amminadab (Ammon)|Amminadab I]] was among the tributaries who suffered in the course of the great Arabian campaign of [[Assurbanipal]]. Other kings attested to in contemporary sources are [[Barakel]] (attested to in several contemporary [[seal (device)|seal]]s and [[Hissalel]] who reigned about 620 BCE (and who is mentioned on an inscription on a bottle found at [[Tel Siran]], Jordan along with his son, King Amminadab II, who reigned around 600 BCE.)

With the neighbouring tribes, the Ammonites under King [[Baalis]] helped the [[Babylonian]] monarch [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadrezzar]] against [[Jehoiakim]] (2 Kings 24:2); and if they joined [[Zedekiah]]'s conspiracy ([[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 27:3), and were threatened by the [[Babylonian]] army ([[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 21:20), they do not appear to have suffered greatly.

==Subsequent History==

[[Image:Levant 800.png|thumb|400px|right|Map of the southern [[Levant]], c.[[800 BCE]].]]

In the time of [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], the Ammonites seem to have been fickle in their political attitude. They assisted the [[Babylonia]]n army against the Jews (II Kings, xxiv. 2); encroached upon the territory of the [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]]; and occupied [[Heshbon]] and [[Jazer]] ([[Jeremiah]] xlix. 1; ''cf.'' [[Zephaniah]] ii. 8); but the prophetic threatenings in Jer. ix. 26, xxv. 21, xxvii. 3, and [[Ezra]], xxi. 20, point to rebellion by them against Babylonian supremacy. They received [[Jew]]s fleeing before the Babylonians (Jer. xl. 11), and their king, [[Baalis]], instigated the murder of [[Gedaliah]], the Babylonians' Jewish governor of Jerusalem and its environs (ibid. xl. 14, xli. 15). 

At the time of the rebuilding of Jerusalem by Ezra and [[Nehemiah]], they were hostile to the Jews, and [[Tobiah]], an Ammonite (possibly the governor of Ammon), incited them to hinder the work (Neh. iii. 35). But inter-marriages between Jews and Ammonites were frequent (Ezra, ix. 1; I Esd. viii. 69, and elsewhere). 

Little mention is made of the Ammonites through the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and early [[Hellenistic]] periods. Their name appears, however, during the time of the [[Maccabees]]. The Ammonites, with some of the neighbouring tribes, did their utmost to resist and check the revival of the Jewish power under [[Judas Maccabaeus]] ([[1 Maccabees]] v. 6; cf.  [[Josephus]] ''Ant. Jud.'' xii. 8. 1.). 

It is stated (I Macc. v. 6) that the Ammonites under [[Timotheus (Ammon)|Timotheus]] were defeated by Judas; but it is possible that, after the exile, the term Ammonite denoted all peoples living in the former country of Ammon and Gad. [[Ezekiel]] xxv. 4-5 seems to mark the beginning of an immigration of tribes from the [[Arabian]] desert (''cf.'' Neh. ii. 19, iv. 7, Josephus, &quot;Ant.&quot; xiii. 9, § 1).

The last notice of the Ammonites themselves is in [[Justin Martyr]] (''Dial. cum Tryph.'' sec.  119), where it is affirmed that they were still a numerous people.

==[[Language]]==
''Main Article: [[Ammonite language]]''

The few Ammonite names that have been preserved (Nahash, [[Hanun]], and those mentioned above; [[Zelek]] in 2 Samuel 23:37 is textually uncertain) testify, in harmony with other considerations, that their language was [[Semitic]], closely allied to the [[Hebrew language]] and the [[Moabite language]].

==[[Religion]]==

Of the customs, religion, and constitution of the Ammonites, little is known. The frequent assumption that, living on the borders of the desert, they remained more pastoral than the Moabites and Israelites, is unfounded (Ezek. xxv. 4, II Chron. xxvii. 5); the environs of Rabbah, at least, were fertile and were tilled. In regard to other cities than Rabbah, see Judges, xi. 33; II Sam. xii. 31. Of their gods the name of only the chief deity, [[Milcom]] (sometimes given as [[Moloch]]), as in I Kings, xi. 5 [LXX. 7], 33; I Kings, xi. 7; II Kings, xxiii. 13). In Jer. xlix. 1, 3, &quot;Malcam&quot; is to be translated by &quot;Milcom&quot; (the god) and not as in A. V., &quot;their king.&quot; In the Bible Milcom is described as having been worshipped with [[human sacrifice]].

From the names of their kings, it seems logical that the [[cult]] of the [[Baal]]im probably coexisted in Ammon, as, possibly, that of [[El (god)|El]]. The name Tobiah suggests that [[YHWH]] may have been worshipped in Ammon as well; possibly this was an import from the era of Israelite domination. Other inscriptions and names suggest the possibility that such gods as the [[Edomite]] deity [[Kaus]] had Ammonite cults.

==Economy==

Like its sister-kingdom of Moab, Ammon was the source of numerous natural resources, including [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]]. It had a productive agricultural sector and occupied a vital place along the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]], the ancient trade route connecting Egypt with [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria]], and [[Anatolia]]. As with the Edomites and Moabites, trade along this route gave them considerable revenue.

==In [[Jewish law]]==

The Ammonites, still numerous in the south of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the second Christian century according to Justin Martyr (&quot;Dialogus cum Tryphone,&quot; ch. cxix.), presented a serious problem to the [[Pharisees]] because many marriages with Ammonite and Moabite wives had taken place in the days of Nehemiah (Neh. xiii. 23). Still later, it is not improbable that when Judas Maccabeus had inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Ammonites, Jewish warriors took Ammonite women as wives, and their sons, sword in hand, claimed recognition as Jews notwithstanding the law (Deut. xxiii. 4) that &quot;an Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord.&quot; Such a condition or a similar incident is reflected in the story told in the [[Talmud]] (Yeb. 76b, 77a; Ruth R. to ii. 5) that in the days of King Saul the legitimacy of David's claim to royalty was disputed on account of his descent from Ruth, the Moabite; whereupon [[Ithra]], the Israelite (II Sam. xvii. 25; compare I Chron. ii. 17), girt with his sword, strode like an Ishmaelite into the schoolhouse of [[Jesse]], declaring upon the authority of [[Samuel]], the prophet, and his [[bet din]] (court of justice), that the law excluding the Ammonite and Moabite from the Jewish congregation referred only to the men—who alone had sinned in not meeting Israel with bread and water—and not to the women. The story reflects actual conditions in pre-Talmudic times, conditions that led to the fixed rule stated in the [[Mishnah]] (Yeb. viii. 3): &quot;Ammonite and Moabite men are excluded from the Jewish community for all time; their women are admissible.&quot;

The fact that Rehoboam, the son of King Solomon, was born of an Ammonite woman (I Kings, xiv. 21-31) also made it difficult to maintain the [[Messiah|messianic]] claims of the [[Davidic line|house of David]]; but it was adduced as an illustration of divine [[Divine providence|Providence]] which selected the &quot;two doves,&quot; [[Ruth]], the Moabite, and Naamah, the Ammonite, for honorable distinction (B. Ḳ. 38b).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ammonius Hermiae''' ([[5th century]] AD) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Greek]] [[philosopher]], and the son of [[Hermias]] or Hermeias, a fellow-pupil of [[Proclus]]. He taught at [[Alexandria]], and had among his scholars [[Asclepius]], [[John Philoponus]], [[Damascius]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]]. 

Of his reputedly numerous writings, his commentaries on [[Plato]] and [[Ptolemy]] are lost, but we have:
#A commentary on the ''Isagoge'' of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (Venice, 1500 fol.);
#A commentary on the ''Categories'' (Venice, 1503 fol.), the authenticity of which is doubted by [[C. A. Brandis]]; 
#A commentary on the ''De Interpretatione'' (Venice, 1503 fol.). They are printed in Brandis's [[scholia]] to Aristotle, forming the fourth volume of the [[Berlin]] Aristotle; they are also edited (1891-1899) in A. Busse's ''Commentaria in Aristot. Graeca''. The special section on fate was published separately by [[J. C. Orelli]], ''Alex. Aphrod., Ammonii, et aliorum de Fato quae supersunt'' (Zurich, 1824).  
#Other commentaries on the Topics and the first six books of the [[Metaphysics]] of [[Aristotle]] still exist in manuscript. 

A life of Aristotle, ascribed to Ammonius, but with more accuracy to [[John Philoponus]], is often prefixed to editions of Aristotle. It has been printed separately, with Latin translation and scholia, at [[Leiden]], 1621, at [[Helmstedt]], 1666, and at [[Paris]], 1850.

Of the value of the logical writings of Ammonius there are various opinions.  K. Prantl speaks of them with great, but hardly merited, contempt.

For a list of his works see [[Johann Albert Fabricius|J. A. Fabricius]], ''Bibliotheca Graeca,'' v. 704-707: [[C. A. Brandis]], ''Uber d.  Reihenf. d. Bucher d. Aristot. Org.,'' 283 f.; [[K. Prantl]], ''Gesch. d.  Logik,'' i. 642.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ammonius Saccas''' ([[3rd century|3rd century AD]]) was a Greek [[philosopher]] of [[Alexandria]], often called the founder of the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic school]].

Of humble origin, he appears to have earned a livelihood as a [[Porter (carrier)|porter]] at the docks of Alexandria; hence his nickname of &quot;Sack-bearer&quot; (''Sakkas,'' for ''sakkoforos''). The details of his life are unknown. After long study and meditation, Ammonius opened a school of philosophy in Alexandria, where his principal pupils were [[Herennius]], the two [[Origen]]s, [[Cassius Longinus]] and [[Plotinus]]. As he designedly wrote nothing, and, with the aid of his pupils, kept his views secret after the manner of the [[Pythagoreans]], his philosophy must be inferred mainly from the writings of Plotinus. As [[Eduard Zeller]] points out, however, there is reason to think that his doctrines were closer to those of the earlier [[Platonic idealism|Platonists]] than to those of Plotinus. [[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]], writing in the [[5th century]], states that Ammonius' fundamental doctrine was an eclecticism, derived from a critical study of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. His admirers credited him with having reconciled the quarrels of the two great schools. His death is variously given between AD [[240]] and [[245]], at a great age.

The details of the life of the philosopher Ammonius Saccas are so unclear that he has frequently been confused with a Christian philosopher of the [[Ammonius of Alexandria (Christian)|same name]].

The '''Book of Amos''' is one of the books of the [[Nevi'im]] and of the [[Old Testament]].

==Who wrote it?==
'''[[Amos (prophet)|Amos]]''' was a [[prophet]] during the reign of Jeroboam ben Joash (Jeroboam II), ruler of [[Israel]] from 793 BCE to 753 BCE, and the reign of Uzziah, King of Judah, at a time when both kingdoms (Israel in the North and Judah in the South) were peaking in prosperity. He was a contemporary of the prophet [[Hosea]], but likely preceded him. Many of the earlier accounts of prophets found in the [[Old Testament]] are found within the context of other accounts of Israel's history. Amos, however, is the first prophet whose name also serves as the title of the corresponding biblical book in which his story is found.

It is unlikely that Amos  was a &quot;professional prophet&quot;, trained to work in the king's court. Rather, he gives the account of being called by God while working in his trade as a herdsman and farmer. The food that he farmed (sycamore figs) is thought to be a food most widely known as part of an [[Ancient Egyptian|Egyptian]] commoner's diet. Therefore, scholars assume that Amos was not a member of the wealthy elite who he, by God's command, condemns in his prophesy.  Rather he appears to be a working-class shepherd. Amos pointed out that he was not trained as a professional prophet, but did not condemn prophecy in itself.

==When was it written?==
Most scholars believe that [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] gave his message in the autumn of 750 BCE or 749 BCE. It is generally understood that his preaching at [[Bethel]] lasted only a single day at the least and a few days at the most. Leading up to this time, Assyrian armies battled against [[Damascus]] for a number of years, which greatly diminished Syria's threat to [[Israel]]. As a result of the fighting amongst its neighbors, Israel had the benefit of increasing its borders almost to those of the time of [[David]] and [[Solomon]]. 

It should also be noted that Amos preached about two years before a very large earthquake, and made reference to it twice in his book. [[Zechariah]] remembers this earthquake over 200 years later (Zech. 14:5).

==Where was it written?==
Some scholars believe that [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]]' message was recorded after he delivered it to the Northern Kingdom, upon returning to his southern homeland of [[Tekoa]], a town eight kilometres south of [[Bethlehem]]. It is mentioned many times in the [[Old Testament]] ([[Joshua]] 15:39, [[2 Samuel]] 14:9 and 23:26, [[1 Chronicles]] 11:28). [[Rehoboam]] is reported to have fortified Tekoa along with other cities in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] in [[2 Chronicles]] 11:5-6. 

There are some differing opinions as to the location of the Tekoa Amos was presumably from. It is believed by most that Amos was a southern farmer, called by [[God]] to deliver his prophetic message in the North. However, some believe that Amos was actually from a Tekoa in the North, near [[Galilee]], but this is most likely not true. They believe that it is more probable that Amos was from the North because it has conditions more suitable for the cultivation of sycamore figs than the Tekoa of the South. Sycamore figs grow at a low elevation, lower than the Tekoa of Judah, which is at a relatively high elevation of 850 metres (overlooking both [[Jerusalem]] and [[Bethlehem]]). Others have discredited the theory about the Galilean Tekoa, citing that the difference in elevation between the two locations is not significant. Scholars in support of the idea of Amos being from the North also say it makes more sense because of Amaziah's accusation of conspiracy in chapter seven, verse 10. A conspirator, they argue, is more likely to be a national. 

Two other opinions of where Amos' writings were recorded deserve mention. They are that 1) disciples of Amos followed him and recorded his message and 2) that someone in his audience in the North recorded his message.

==Why was it written?==
The Book of Amos is set in a time when the people of [[Israel]] have reached a low point in their devotion to [[Yahweh]] - the people have become greedy and have stopped following and adhering to their values. The wealthy elite are becoming rich at the expense of others. Peasent farmers who once practiced subsistence farming are being forced to farm what is best for foreign trade, mostly wine and oil. 

Yahweh speaks to Amos, a farmer and herder and tells him to go to [[Samaria]], the capital of the Northern kingdom. Through Amos, Yahweh tells the people that he is going to judge Israel for its sins, and it will be a foreign nation that will enact his judgement. 

The people understand judgment as the coming of &quot;the Day of the Lord.&quot; &quot;The Day of the Lord&quot; was widely celebrated and highly anticipated by the followers of Yahweh. However, Amos came to tell the people that &quot;the Day of the Lord&quot; was coming soon and that it meant divine judgment and justice for their own iniquity.

==What are the themes of the books?==
Many scholars break the book of Amos up into three sections. Chapters one and two look at the nations surrounding [[Israel]] and then Israel itself through a moral/ethical filter. Chapters three to six are a collection of verses that look more specifically at Israel's transgressions. Chapters seven to nine include visions that [[Yahweh]] gave Amos as well as Amaziah's rebuke of the prophet. The last section of the book (7:1 to 9:8), commonly referred to as the Book of Visions, contains the only narrative section. 

In the first two visions, [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] is able to convince Yahweh not to act out the scenes of discipline presented to him. The ideas of discipline and justice, although not enacted here, corresponds to the central message in what some refer to as the Book of Woes (5:1 to 6:14). This message can be seen most clearly in verse 24 of chapter five. The plagues in the preceding chapter, chapter four, were supposed to be seen as acts of discipline that turned Israel back to Yahweh. However, the people did not interpret the acts this way and the discipline turned into judgment for the people's disobedience. In the second set of visions (7:7-9), there is no intercession by Amos and Yahweh says that he &quot;will never pass by them again.&quot; The plight of Israel has become hopeless. [[God]] will not hold back judgment because Israel refuses to listen to the prophets and even goes so far as to try to silence them (2:12, 3:8, 7:10-17). 

The central idea of the book of Amos according to most scholars is that Yahweh puts his people on the same level as the nations that surround it -- Yahweh expects the same morality of them all. As it is with all nations that rise up against the kingdom of Yahweh, even Israel and Judah will not be exempt from the judgment of Yahweh because of their idolatry and unjust ways. The nation that represents Yahweh must be made pure of anything or anyone that profanes the name of Yahweh. Yahweh's name must be exalted. 

Other major themes in the book of Amos include: social justice and concern for the disadvantaged; the idea that Israel's [[covenant]] with Yahweh did not exempt them from his standards of morality; Yahweh is [[God]] of all nations; Yahweh is judge of all nations; Yahweh is God of moral righteousness; Yahweh made all people; Yahweh elected Israel and then redeemed Israel so that he would be known throughout the world; election by Yahweh means that those elected are responsible to live according to the purposes clearly outlined to them in the law; Yahweh will only destroy the unjust and a remnant will remain and; Yahweh is free to judge, redeem and act as savior to Israel.

'''Amphipolis''' (modern Greek: '''Amfipoli'''; see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]), was an ancient city of [[Macedon]]ia, on the east bank of the river [[Strymon]], where it emerges from Lake Cercinitis, about 3 m. from the sea.

Originally a [[Thracian]] town, known as ''Ennea Odoi'' (&quot;Nine Roads&quot;), it was [[colonized]] by Athenians with other Greeks under [[Hagnon]] in [[437 BC]], previous attempts--in [[497 BC|497]], [[476 BC|476]] (Schol. [[Aeschines|Aesch.]] ''De fals. leg.'' 31) and [[465 BC|465]]--having been unsuccessful.

In [[424 BC]] it surrendered to the Spartan [[Brasidas]] without resistance, owing to the gross negligence of the historian [[Thucydides]], who was with the fleet at [[Thasos]].  In [[422 BC]] [[Cleon]] led an unsuccessful expedition to recover it, in which both he and Brasidas were slain (see [[Battle of Amphipolis]]).

The importance of Amphipolis in ancient times was due to the fact that it commanded the bridge over the Strymon, and consequently the route from northern [[Greece]] to the [[Hellespont]]; it was important also as a depot for the gold and silver mines of the district, and for timber, which was largely used in shipbuilding.  This importance is shown by the fact that, in the [[peace of Nicias]] ([[421 BC]]), its restoration to [[Athens]] is made the subject of a special provision, and that about [[417 BC|417]], this provision not having been observed, at least one expedition was made by Nicias with a view to its recovery.

[[Philip of Macedon]] made a special point of occupying it ([[357 BC|357]]), and under the early empire it became the headquarters of the Roman propraetor, though it was recognized as independent.
Many inscriptions, coins, etc., have been found here, and traces of the ancient fortifications and of a [[Roman aqueduct]] are visible. 

==Amphipolis in other media==

[[Xena]], the main fictional character in the [[TV]] series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', was of Amphipolis.

'''Amram''' ('''&amp;#1506;&amp;#1463;&amp;#1502;&amp;#1456;&amp;#1512;&amp;#1464;&amp;#1501;''' &quot;Friend of the most high ([[Elohim|God]]&quot;), or &quot;People are Exalted&quot; [[Standard Hebrew]] '''&amp;#703;Amram''', [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''&amp;#703;Amr&amp;#257;m''') is a [[Levite]], a son of [[Kohath]], the husband of [[Jochebed]] (Ex 6,20 and Num 26,59) and father of [[Aaron]], [[Miriam]] and [[Moses]]. He is mentioned in the [[Book of Exodus]].

According to the [[Talmud]], Amram promulgated the laws of [[marriage]] and [[divorce]] amongst the Jews in Egypt.

The Arabic version refers to the father of Moses as Imran - and the Israeli/Jewish people are referred to as &quot;Aale Imran&quot; (Children of Imran) in the [[Qur'an]], the third [[Surah]] of which is titled ''The House of Imran''. &quot;Imran&quot; is also the name attributed by Muslims to the father of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] (he is not named in the Bible, but called &quot;Joachim&quot; in Catholic and Orthodox Tradition).

The Testament of Amram ([[2nd century BC]]) is the name assigned to one of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (4Q535, Manuscript B). It is related to the [[Watchers]]:

''[[Enoch]]: &quot;I saw Watchers in my vision, the dream-vision. Two men were fighting over me ... holding a great contest over me. I asked them, 'Who are you, that you are thus empowered over me?' They answered, 'We have been empowered and rule over all mankind.' They said to me, 'Which of us do you choose to rule you?' I raised my eyes and looked. One of them was terrifying in his appearance, like a serpent, his cloak, many-colored yet very dark. ... And I looked again, and in his appearance, his visage like a [[viper]]. ... I replied to him, 'This Watcher, who is he?' He answered, 'This Watcher ... his three names are [[Belial]] and [[Prince of Darkness]] and [[King of Evil]].' I said (to the other Watcher), 'My lord, what dominion (have you?)' He answered, 'You saw (the viper), and he is empowered over all Darkness, while I (am empowered over all Light.) ... My three names are [[Michael]], [[Prince of Light]] and [[King of Righteousness]].'&quot;'' (translation  Prof. Robert Eisenman)

'''Amyntas III''' (or '''II'''), son of Arrhidaeus, grandfather of [[Alexander the Great]], was king of [[Macedon]] from [[393 BC|393]] (or 389) to [[369 BC]].

He came to the throne after the ten years of confusion which followed the death of [[Archelaus II of Macedon|Archelaus II]], the patron of art and literature. But he had many enemies at home; in [[383 BC|383]] he was driven out by the [[Illyria]]ns, but in the following year, with the aid of the [[Thessalia]]ns, he recovered his kingdom.

He concluded a treaty with the [[Sparta]]ns, who assisted him to reduce [[Olynthus]] ([[379 BC|379]]).  He also entered into a league with [[Jason of Pherae]], and assiduously cultivated the friendship of [[Athens]].

By his wife, [[Eurydice II of Macedon|Eurydice]], he had three sons, the youngest of whom was the famous [[Philip II of Macedon]].

:''&quot;He marvelled that among the Greeks, those who were skillful in a thing vie in competition; those who have ''no'' skill, judge&quot;'' &amp;mdash;[[Diogenes Laertius]], of Anacharsis.

'''Anacharsis''' was a [[Scythian]] philosopher who travelled from his homeland on the northern shores of the [[Black Sea]] to Athens in the early [[6th century BCE]] and made a great impression as a forthright, outspoken &quot;[[barbarian]],&quot; apparently a forerunner of the [[Skepticism|Skeptics]] and [[Cynics]], though none of his authentic works have survived. 

Anacharsis was half Greek and the son of a Scythian chief, from a mixed Hellenistic culture, apparently in the region of the [[Cimmerian Bosporus]]. He cultivated the outsider's knack of seeing the illogic in familiar things. His conversation was droll and frank, and Solon and the Athenians took to him as a natural philosopher, not unlike the way the French took to [[Benjamin Franklin]]. His rough and free discourse became proverbial among Athenians as 'Scythian discourse'. 

Arriving in Athens about 589 BCE, he came to the house of [[Solon]] the philosopher and lawgiver, and told Solon's slave that Anacharsis was come to visit, desired to see Solon, and wanted to enter into hospitable relations. The servant returned with Solon's quintessentially Greek answer, &quot;Men generally limit such hospitality to their own countrymen.&quot; Thereupon the Scythian stepped significantly across the threshold, and said that, now that he was in Solon's country, it would be quite suitable.

Anacharis was the first stranger who received the privileges of Athenian citizenship. He was reckoned one of the [[Seven Sages of Athens]], and it is said that he was initiated into the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] of the Great Goddess, a privilege denied to those who did not speak fluent Greek. 

His book paralleling the laws of the Scythians with the laws of the Greeks has been lost. It was he who compared laws to spiders' webs, which catch small flies and allow wasps and hornets to escape. 

He exhorted moderation in everything, saying that the vine bears three clusters of grapes: the first wine, pleasure; the second, drunkenness, the third, disgust. So he became a kind of [[emblem]] to the Athenians, who inscribed on his statues: 'Restrain your tongues, your appetites, your passions.' (Compare the philosophy of [[Epicurus]].)

His famous ''Letter to [[Croesus]]'', the proverbially rich king of [[Lydia]], is apocryphal, but typical of his quality:

:&quot;Anarcharsis to Croesus: O king of the Lydians, I am come to the country of the Greeks, in order to become acquainted with their customs and institutions; but I have no need of gold, and shall be quite contented if I return to Scythia a better man than I left it. However I will come to Sardis, as I think it very desirable to become a friend of yours.&quot;

When he did return to the Scythians, he was killed, Herodotus (iv, 76) reported, by his own brother, for his Greek ways and especially for the impious attempt to sacrifice to the Mother Goddess [[Cybele]], whose role was unwelcome among the patriarchal Scythians.

[[Strabo]] makes him the (probably legendary) inventor of the [[anchor]] with two flukes.

==The revival of Anacharsis in the 18th century== 
In [[1788]] [[Jean Jacques Barthelemy]] (1716-95), a highly esteemed classical scholar and Jesuit, published ''The Travels of Anacharsis the Younger in Greece,'' a learned imaginary travel journal, one of the first [[historical novel]]s, which a modern scholar has called &quot;the encyclopedia of the new cult of the antique&quot; in the late 18th Century; it had a high impact on the growth of [[philhellenism]] in France at the time. The book went through many editions, was reprinted in the United States and translated into German and other languages. It later inspired European sympathy for the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek struggle for independence]] and spawned sequels and imitations through the [[19th century]].

'''Anacreon''' (born ca. [[570 BC]]) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[lyric poem|lyric]] [[poet]], notable for his drinking songs and hymns.  Later Greeks included him in the canonical list of [[nine lyric poets]].

== Life ==
He was born at [[Teos]], an [[Ionia]]n city on the coast of [[Asia Minor]]. Little more is known of his life, but it is likely that he shared the voluntary exile of the mass of his fellow-townsmen who sailed to [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] in [[Thrace]], where they founded a colony, rather than remaining behind to surrender their city to [[Harpagus]], one of [[Cyrus the Great]]'s generals. Cyrus was, at the time ([[545 BC]]), besieging the Greek cities of [[Asia Minor]]. Anacreon seems to have taken part in the fighting, in which, on his own admission, he did not distinguish himself.  

From Thrace he removed to the court of [[Polycrates of Samos]]. He is said to  have acted as [[tutor]] to Polycrates; that he enjoyed the [[tyrant]]'s confidence we learn on the authority of [[Herodotus]] (iii.121), who represents the poet as sitting in the royal chamber when audience was given to the [[Iran|Persia]]n herald. In return for his favour and protection, Anacreon wrote many complimentary [[ode]]s upon his patron. Like his fellow-lyric poet, [[Horace]], who was one of his great admirers, and in many respects a kindred spirit, Anacreon seems to have been made for the society of courts. On the death of Polycrates, [[Hipparchus (son of Pisistratus)|Hipparchus]], who was then in power at [[Athens]] and inherited the literary tastes of his father [[Pisistratus|Peisistratus]], sent a special embassy to fetch the popular poet to Athens in a galley of fifty oars. Here he became acquainted with the poet [[Simonides]], and other members of the brilliant circle which had gathered round Hipparchus. When this circle was broken up by the assassination of Hipparchus, Anacreon seems to have returned to his native town of Teos, where, according to a metrical epitaph ascribed to his friend Simonides, he died and was buried. According to others, before returning to Teos, he accompanied Simonides to the court of [[Echecrates]], a [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] dynast of the house of the [[Aleuadae]]. [[Lucian]] mentions Anacreon amongst his instances of the longevity of eminent men, as having completed eighty-five years. If an anecdote given by [[Pliny the Elder]] (''Nat. Hist.'' vii. 7) is to be trusted, he was choked at last by a grape-stone, but the story has an air of mythical adaptation to the poet's habits, which makes it somewhat [[apocryphal]].  

Anacreon was for a long time popular at Athens, where his statue was to be seen on the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]], together with that of his friend [[Xanthippus]], the father of [[Pericles]]. On several coins of Teos he is represented holding a lyre in his hand, sometimes sitting, sometimes standing. A marble statue found in [[1835]] in the [[Sabine]] district, and now in the [[Villa Borghese]], is said to represent Anacreon.  

== Poetry ==
Anacreon had a reputation as a composer of hymns, as well as of those [[bacchanalian]] and amatory   lyrics - some of a [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic]] nature - which are commonly associated with his name. Two short hymns to [[Artemis]] and [[Dionysus]], consisting of eight and eleven lines respectively, stand first amongst his few undisputed remains, as printed by recent editors. But pagan hymns, especially when addressed to such deities as [[Aphrodite]], [[Eros (god)|Eros]] and [[Dionysus]], are not so very unlike what we call &quot;Anacreontic&quot; poetry as to make the contrast of style as great as the word might seem to imply. The tone of Anacreon's lyric effusions has probably led to an unjust estimate, by both ancients and moderns, of the poet's personal character. The &quot;triple worship&quot; of the [[Muses]], Wine and Love, ascribed to him as his religion in an old Greek epigram (''Anthol.'' iii. 25, 51), may have been as purely professional in the two last cases as in the first, and his private character on such points was probably neither much better nor worse than that of his contemporaries. [[Athenaeus]] remarks acutely that he seems at least to have been sober when he wrote; and he himself strongly repudiates, as Horace does, the brutal characteristics of intoxication as fit only for [[barbarian]]s and [[Scythian]]s (Fr. 64). 

Of the five books of lyrical pieces by Anacreon which the ''[[Suda]]'' and Athenaeus mention as extant in their time, we have now but the merest fragments, collected from the citations of later writers. Those graceful little poems (most of them first printed from the MSS. by [[Henry Estienne]] in [[1554]]), which long passed among the learned for the songs of Anacreon, and which are well-known to many English readers in the translations of [[Abraham Cowley]] and Moore, are really of much later date, though possibly here and there genuine fragments of the poet are included. Modern critics, however, regard the entire collection as imitations belonging to different periods--the oldest probably to [[Alexandria]]n times, the most recent to the last days of [[paganism]]. They will always retain a certain popularity from their lightness and elegance, and some of them are fair copies of Anacreon's style, which would lend itself readily enough to a clever imitator. A strong argument against their genuineness lies in the fact that the peculiar forms of the [[Ionic Greek]], in which Anacreon wrote, are not to be found in these reputed odes, while the fragments of his poems quoted by ancient writers are full of Ionicisms.  Again, only one of the quotations from Anacreon in ancient writers is to be found in these poems, which further contain no references to contemporaries, whereas [[Strabo]] (xiv. p. 638) expressly states that Anacreon's poems included numerous allusions to [[Polycrates]]. In particular, Anacreon addresses a poem to the boy Smerdis, with whom he had fallen in love, and whom Polycrates, in a fit of jealousy had shorn of his locks (Athenaeus (12.540e) and Aelian (VH 9.4). The character of Love as a mischievous little boy is quite different from that given by Anacreon, who describes him as &quot;striking with a mighty [[axe]], like a [[smith]],&quot; and is more akin to the conceptions of later literature.

==A Poem==
'''The Wounded Cupid. Song'''

Cupid as he lay among&lt;br /&gt;
Roses, by a Bee was stung.&lt;br /&gt;
Whereupon in anger flying&lt;br /&gt;
To his Mother, said thus crying;&lt;br /&gt;
Help! O help! your Boy's a dying.&lt;br /&gt;
And why, my pretty Lad, said she?&lt;br /&gt;
Then blubbering, replied he,&lt;br /&gt;
A winged Snake has bitten me&lt;br /&gt;
Which Country people call a Bee.&lt;br /&gt;
At which she smil'd; then with her hairs&lt;br /&gt;
And kisses drying up his tears:&lt;br /&gt;
Alas! said she, my Wag! if this&lt;br /&gt;
Such a pernicious torment is:&lt;br /&gt;
Come, tell me then, how great's the smart&lt;br /&gt;
Of those, thou woundest with thy Dart!&lt;br /&gt;

Translated from the Greek by [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]] ([[1591]]-[[1674]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This article is about the town of Anah. For the character in the Book of [[Genesis]], see [[Minor characters in the Book of Genesis]].''

'''Anah''', or '''`Ana''', a town on the [[Euphrates]], about mid-way between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the [[Persian Gulf]]. It is called '''Hanat''' in a Babylonian letter (about [[2200 BC]]), and '''An-at''' by the scribe of Assur-nasir-pal (879 B.C.), Anatho (Isidore Charax), Anatha (Ammianus Marcellinus) by Greek and Latin writers in the early Christian centuries, 
`Ana (sometimes, as if plural, `Anat) by Arabic writers. The name has been connected with that of the deity Anat.

Whilst `Ana has thus retained its name for forty-one centuries the site is variously described. Most early writers concur in placing it on an island; so [[Assur-nasir-pal]], [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]], [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], [[Ibn Serapion]], [[al-Istakri]], [[Abulfeda]] and [[al-Karamani]]. Ammianus (lib. 24, c. 2) calls it a munimentum, Theophylactus Simocatta (iv. 10, v. 1, 2) to 'Anathon frourion, [[Zosimus]] (iii. 14) a frourion, opp. Fathusai, which may be the Beth(th)ina of Ptolemy (v. 19).&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Leonhart Rauwolff, in AD 1574, found it &quot;divided ... into two towns,&quot; the one &quot;Turkish,&quot; &quot;so surrounded by the river, that you cannot go into it but by boats,&quot; the other, much larger, on the Arabian side of the river.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; GA Olivier in the beginning of the 19th century describes it as a long street (5 or 6 m. long), parallel to the right bank of the Euphrates--some 100 yards from the water's edge and 300 to 400 paces from the rocky barrier of the Arabian desert--with, over against its lower part, an island bearing at its north end the ruins of a fortress (p. 451).

This southernmost town of [[Mesopotamia]] proper (Gezira) must have shared the chequered history of that land. Of `Ana's fortunes under the early Babylonian 
empire the records have not yet been unearthed; but in a letter dating from the third millennium BC, six men of Hanat (Ha-na-atK1) are mentioned in a statement as to certain disturbances which had occurred in the sphere of the Babylonian 
Resident of Suhi, which would include the district of `Ana.

How `Ana fared at the hands of the Mitanni and others is unknown.  The suggestion that [[Amenhotep I|Amenophis (Amenhotep) I]]. ([[16th century BC]]) refers to it is improbable; but we seem to be justified in holding `Ana to be the town &quot;in the middle of the Euphrates&quot; opposite (ina put) to which 
Assur-nasir-pal halted in his campaign of 879 BC. The supposed reference to `Ana in the speech put into the mouth of [[Sennacherib]]'s messengers to Hezekiah (2 Kings xix. 13, Is. xxxvii. 13) is exceedingly improbable.  The town may be mentioned, however, in four 7th century documents edited by [[Claude Hermann Walter Johns]].&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

It was at `Ana that the emperor Julian met the first opposition on his disastrous expedition against [[Iran|Persia]] (363), when he got possession of the place and transported the people; and there that Ziyad and Shureih with the advanced guard of `Ali's army were refused passage across the Euphrates (36/657) to join `Ali in Mesopotamia (Tabari i. 3261).

Later `Ana was the place of exile of the caliph Qaim (al-qaim bi-amr-illah) when [[Basisiri]] was in power (450/1058.) In the 14th century `Ana was the seat of a 
Catholicos, primate of the Persians (Marin Sanuto). In 1610 [[Della Valle]] found a [[Scotland|Scot]], George Strachan, resident at `Ana (to study Arabic) as physician to the amir (i. 671-681).  In 1835 the steamer &quot;Tigris&quot; of the English Euphrates expedition went down in a hurricane just above `Ana, near where Julian's force had suffered from a similar storm.  Della Valle described `Ana as the chief Arab town on the Euphrates, an importance which it owes to its position on one of the routes from the west to [[Baghdad]]; Texeira said that the power of its amir extended to [[Palmyra]] (early 17th century); but Olivier found the ruling prince with only twenty-five men in his service, the town becoming more depopulated every day from lack of protection from the Arabs of the desert.  
[[Von Oppenheim]] (1893) reported that Turkish troops having been recently stationed at the place, it had no longer to pay blackmail (huwwa) to the Arabs.  [[FR Chesney]] reported some 1800 houses, 2 mosques and 16 water-wheels; WF Ainsworth (1835) reported the Arabs as inhabiting the northwestern part of the town, the Christians the centre, and the Jews the southeast; Della Valle (1610) found some sun-worshippers still there.

Modern `Ana lies from west to east on the right bank along a bend of the river just before it turns south towards Hit, and presents an attractive appearance. It extends, chiefly as a single street, for several miles along a narrow strip 
of land between the river and a ridge of rocky hills. The houses are separated from one another by fruit gardens. `Ana marks the boundary between the olive (north) and the date (south). Arab poets celebrated its wine (Yuqut, iii. 593 
f.), and Mustaufi (8/14th century) tells of the fame of its palm-groves. In the river, facing the town, is a succession of equally productive islands. The most easterly contains the ruins of the old castle, whilst the remains of the ancient Anatho extend from this island for about 2 miles down the left bank. Coarse cloth is almost the only manufacture.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Steph. Byz. (sub Turos) says that [[Arrian]] calls Anatha Turos. 

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Texeira (1610) says that &quot;Anna&quot; lay on both banks of the river, and so Della Valle (i. 671).

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''Note: the word'' '''Ananda''' ''means [[Bliss (feeling)|bliss]] in [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit language]] and is quite often part of a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Sanyasa|monastic]] name.''
{{buddhism}}
'''Ananda''' (Ch:阿難) was one of many principal disciples of the [[Shakyamuni Buddha|Buddha]], a devout attendant and was renowned as the ''Guardian of the Dharma.''

Ananda was the first cousin of the Buddha, and 
was devotedly attached to him.  Once he entered the Order 
in the second year of the Buddha's ministry, he became one 
of his personal attendants, accompanying him on most of his 
wanderings and being the interlocutor in many of the recorded 
dialogues.  He is the subject of a special [[panegyric]] delivered 
by the Buddha just before his death ([[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]], 
[[Digha Nikaya]] 16); but it is the panegyric of an unselfish 
man, kindly, thoughtful for others and popular; not of the 
intellectual man, versed in the theory and practice of the 
Buddhist system of self-culture.  So in the long list of 
the disciples given in the [[Anguttara]] (i. xiv.) where each 
of them is declared to be the chief in some gift, Ananda is 
mentioned five times (which is more often than any other), 
but it is as chief in conduct and in service to others and 
in power of memory, not in any of the intellectual powers 
so highly prized in the community.  This explains why he had 
not attained to arahatship; and in the earliest account of 
the convocation said to have been held by five hundred of 
the principal disciples immediately after the Buddha's death, 
he was the only one who was not an [[arahat]] ([[Cullavagga]], 
book xi.).  In later accounts this incident is explained 
away.  Thirty-three verses ascribed to Ananda are preserved 
in a collection of lyrics by the principal male members of the order ([[Theragatha]], 1017-1050).  They 
show a gentle and reverent but simple spirit.

Ananda is often called the disciple of the Buddha who &quot;heard much&quot;; because he attended personally upon the Buddha and often traveled with him, Ananda overheard and memorized many of the discourses delivered by the Buddha to various audiences.  At the [[Buddhist councils|First Council]], convened shortly after the death of the Buddha, Ananda was called upon to recite many of the discourses that later became the [[Sutta Pitaka]] of the [[Pāli Canon]].

Despite his long association and close proximity to the Buddha, Ananda is depicted as being slow to develop along the Buddhist path.  Prior to the First Council, it was proposed that Ananda not be permitted to attend on the grounds that he was not yet an [[arhat]].  According to legend, this prompted Ananda to focus his efforts on the attainment of [[nibbana]], and he was able to reach the specified level of attainment before the calling of the conclave.  Ananda was, however, rebuked by the First Council for failing to request that the Buddha remain in the world for a longer period of time; in the [[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]], the Buddha is depicted dropping a number of hints to Ananda that he can remain in the world as long as is required if it is requested by one of his disciples.  Ananda fails to pick up on the intimation, and the Buddha soon after passes from the world.

In contrast to most of the figures depicted in the [[Pāli Canon]], Ananda is depicted as an imperfect, if sympathetic, figure.  He mourns the deaths of both [[Sariputta]], with whom he enjoyed a close friendship, and the [[Buddha]].  A verse of the [[Theragatha]] [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/theragatha/thag-17-03-ao0.html] reveals his loneliness and isolation following the death of the Buddha.

In the [[Zen]] tradition, Ananda is considered to be the second Indian patriarch.  He is often depicted with the Buddha alongside [[Mahakashyapa]], the first Indian patriarch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ananias''' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] form of '''Hananiah''' (Hebrew for &quot;Yahweh is gracious&quot;), or '''Ananiah''', a name occurring several times in the [[Old Testament]] and [[Apocrypha]] ([[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 3:23, [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 15:23, [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] 5:12. etc.), and three times in the [[New Testament]]. Special mention need be made only of the bearers of the name in the New Testament:

#A member of the first Christian community, who dropped dead suddenly after attempting to deceive the Holy Spirit by withholding part of the profit from the sale of a piece of land. A few moments later his wife, Sapphira also lied and also suffered the same fate.  They both lied to Peter about the amount they had received and individually dropped dead upon hearing Peter's rebuke.([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 5:1-10; cf. [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 7:1 ff.). See [[Ananias and Sapphira]].
#'''Saint Ananias''' (d. ''c.'' [[70]]), A disciple at [[Damascus]] who figures in the story of the conversion and [[baptism]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] (Acts 9:10-17, 22:12-16.) 
#Son of Nedebaios ([[Josephus]], ''Antiquites'' xx. 5. 2), a high priest who presided during the trial of Paul at [[Jerusalem]] and [[Caesarea Palaestina|Caesarea]] (Acts 23:2, 24:1-5). He officiated as high priest from about AD [[47]] to [[59]]. Quadratus, governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], accused him of being responsible for acts of violence. He was sent to [[Rome]] for trial (AD [[52]]), but was acquitted by the emperor [[Claudius]]. Being a friend of the Romans, he was murdered by the people at the beginning of the Jewish war.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dablink|This article is about the philosopher Anaxagoras.  For the mythical Greek King Anaxagoras of [[Argos]], see [[Anaxagoras (mythology)]].}}

[[Image:Anaxagoras.png|thumb|300px|Anaxagoras]]'''Anaxagoras''' (c. [[500 BCE]]&amp;ndash;[[428 BCE]]) was a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] who was likely born about 500 BCE (Apollodorus ap. Diog.  Laert. ii. 7.).  He was a member of what is now often called the [[Ionian School]] of philosophy.

At his native town of [[Clazomenae]] in [[Asia Minor]], he appears to have had some amount of property and prospects of political influence; he supposedly surrendered both of these out of a fear that they would hinder his search for knowledge.  Although a Greek, he was probably a Persian citizen, perhaps even a soldier of the Persian army since Clazomenae was suppressed during the [[Ionian Revolt]].  

In early manhood (c. 464-462 BCE) he went to [[Athens]], which was rapidly becoming the centre of Greek culture.  There he is said to have remained for thirty years.  [[Pericles]] learned to love and admire him, and the poet [[Euripides]] derived from him an enthusiasm for science and humanity.  Some authorities assert that even [[Socrates]] was among his disciples.

Anaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of scientific inquiry from [[Ionia]] to [[Athens]].  His observations of the celestial bodies led him to form new theories of the universal order; he attempted to give a scientific account of [[eclipse]]s, [[meteor]]s, [[rainbow]]s and the [[sun]], which he described as a mass of blazing metal, larger than the [[Peloponnesus]]. The heavenly bodies, he asserted, were masses of stone torn from the earth and ignited by rapid rotation. However, these theories brought him into collision with the popular faith.
  
Anaxagoras was arrested by his friend Pericles' political opponents on a charge of contravening the established [[dogma]]s of religion (some say the charge was one of [[Medism]]), and it required all the eloquence of Pericles to secure his release.  Even so he was forced to retire from Athens to Lampsacus in Ionia (434-433 BCE), where he died about [[428 BCE]].  Citizens of Lampsacus erected an altar to Mind and Truth in his memory, and observed the anniversary of his death for many years afterward.

Anaxagoras wrote a book of philosophy, but only fragments of the first part of this have survived through the preservation of [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] (6th century CE).

== Cosmological theory ==
All things have existed from the beginning.  But originally they existed in infinitesimally small fragments of themselves, endless in number and inextricably combined.  All things existed in this mass, but in a confused and indistinguishable form.  There were the seeds (''spermata'') or miniatures of corn and flesh and gold in the primitive mixture; but these parts, of like nature with their wholes (the ''omoiomere'' of [[Aristotle]]), had to be eliminated from the complex mass before they could receive a definite name and character.

Thought arranged the segregation of like from unlike; ''panta chremata en omou eita nous elthon auta diekosmese''.  This peculiar thing, called Thought (''nous''), was no less illimitable than the chaotic mass, but, unlike the ''[[logos]]'' of [[Heraclitus]], it stood pure and independent (''mounos ef eoutou''), a thing of finer texture, alike in all its manifestations and everywhere the same.  This subtle agent, possessed of all knowledge and power, is especially seen ruling in all the forms of life. 
 
Thought causes motion.  It rotated the primitive mixture, starting in one corner or point, and gradually extended till it gave distinctness and reality to the aggregates of like parts, working something like a centrifuge, and eventually creating the known cosmos.  But even after it had done its best, the original intermixture of things was not wholly overcome.  No one thing in the world is ever abruptly separated, as by the blow of an axe, from the rest of things.  

It is noteworthy that Aristotle accuses Anaxagoras of failing to differentiate between ''nous'' and ''psyche'', while Socrates ([[Plato]], ''Phaedo'', 98 B) objects that his ''nous'' is merely a ''[[deus ex machina]]'' to which he refuses to attribute design and knowledge. 

Anaxagoras proceeded to give some account of the stages in the process from original chaos to present arrangements.  The division into cold mist and warm ether first broke the spell of confusion.  With increasing cold, the former gave rise to water, earth and stones.  The seeds of life which continued floating in the air were carried down with the rains and produced vegetation.  Animals, including man, sprang from the warm and moist clay.  If these things be so, then the evidence of the senses must be held in slight esteem.  We seem to see things coming into being and passing from it; but reflection tells us that decease and growth only mean a new aggregation (sugkrisis) and disruption (''diakrisis'').  Thus Anaxagoras distrusted the senses, and gave the preference to the conclusions of reflection.  Thus he maintained that there must be blackness as well as whiteness in snow; how otherwise could it be turned into dark water? 

Anaxagoras marked a turning-point in the history of philosophy.
With him speculation passes from the colonies of Greece to settle at Athens.  By the theory of minute constituents of things, and his emphasis on mechanical processes in the formation of order, he paved the way for the atomic theory.  However, his enunciation of the order that comes from reason suggested the theory that nature is the work of design.

The conception of thought causing movement in the world passed from him to Aristotle, who postulated a [[Prime mover]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anaxarchus''' (flourished around [[340 BC]]), a [[Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] of the school of [[Democritus]], was born at [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] in [[Thrace]].

He was the companion and friend of [[Alexander the Great]] in his Asiatic campaigns. According to [[Diogenes Laertius]] (Lives 9.10.2), in response to Alexander's claim to have been the son of Zeus-Ammon, Anaxarchus pointed to his bleeding wound and remarked, &quot;See the blood of a mortal, not [[ichor]], such as flows from the veins of the immortal gods.&quot;

[[Plutarch]] tells a story that at [[Bactra]], in [[327 BC]] in a debate with [[Callisthenes]], he advised all to worship Alexander as a god even during his lifetime, is with greater probability attributed to the Sicilian [[Cleon]].

Diogenes Laertius (Lives 9.10.3) also says that [[Nicocreon]], the tyrant of [[Cyprus]], commanded him to be pounded to death in a mortar, and that he endured this torture with fortitude and [[Cicero]] relates the same story.

His philosophical doctrines are not known, though some have inferred from the epithet ''eudaimonikos'' (&quot;fortunate&quot;), usually applied to him, that he held the end of life to be ''[[eudaimonia]].''

[[Image:Arnoldmathew.jpg|thumb|right|Bishop Arnold Harris Mathew]]
'''Arnold Harris Mathew''' ([[1852]]&amp;ndash;[[1919]]) was the first [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]] [[bishop]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. He was a suspended [[Roman Catholic]] priest who became the leading prelate of the Old Catholic sect in the U.K. 

Mathew was appointed in [[1908]] after the Utrecht Union of Churches approved the establishment of a mission in the U.K.  Mathew convinced the continental Old Catholic prelates that he had a significant following in the U.K. which, in fact, was a rather small following.  He was consecrated by Archbishop [[Gerardus Gul]] of Utrecht on [[April 28]], [[1908]]. Assisting Gul was Bishop J. J. Van Thiel of Haarlem, Bishop N. B. P. Spit of Deventer and Bishop J. Demmel of Bonn, Germany. 

He then returned to England and eventually raised a number of men to the episcopacy himself, including two former Catholic priests, Howarth and Beale, who had been excommunicated by the Bishop of Nottingham for embezzling. Mathew then sent documents to [[Pope Pius X]] attesting to the consecrations.  Upon receipt of these documents, Pope Pius X published the ''Bull Cravi Iamdiu Scandalo'' in which he excommunicated Mathew and condemned him as a &quot;pseudo-bishop&quot; and declared him ''vitandus'', a term in church law which meant that Catholics were subject to censure if they had anything to do with Mathew. Pius X also extended his sentence of excommunication to include those who had been consecrated by Mathew.

On [[December 29]], [[1910]] Mathew declared his autonomy from the continental Old Catholics due to disagrements with certain practices and disciplines that Mathew felt deviated from Catholic tradition.

Mathew later consecrated Prince Rudolph Edward de Landes Berghes, an [[Austrian]] nobleman, in [[1913]] for work in [[Scotland]]. 

In [[January 1916]], he announced that he would be reconciled to the [[Holy See]], but changed his mind two months later. He then sought union with the [[Church of England]] but the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] refused to give Mathew any position as an Anglican clergyman. Mathew retired to a village in the countryside and contented himself with assisting at services in an Anglican parish church as a layman.
 
By this time, he had been deserted by his wife and abandoned by virtually all the priests and bishops he had made. He died suddenly in [[December 1919]] and was buried as an Anglican layman. His episcopal seal and other documents disappeared after his death.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anaximenes of Lampsacus''' (fl. [[380 BC|380]] - [[320 BC]]), [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]] [[rhetoric]]ian and historian, was a favourite of [[Alexander the Great]], whom he accompanied in his Persian campaigns.  He wrote histories of [[Greece]] and of [[Philip of Macedon]], and an epic on Alexander (fragments in Muller, ''Scriptores Rerum Alexandri Magni''.) As a rhetorician, he was a determined opponent of 
[[Isocrates]] and his school.  The ''Rhetorica ad Alexandrum'' (&quot;Address to Alexander&quot;), traditionally included among the works of [[Aristotle]], is now generally admitted to be by Anaximenes, although some consider it a much later production.

'''Anaximenes''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]]: &amp;#902;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#958;&amp;#953;&amp;#956;&amp;#941;&amp;#957;&amp;#951;&amp;#962;) of Miletus ([[585 BC]] - [[525 BC]]) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] from the latter half of the [[6th century BC|6th century]], probably a younger contemporary of [[Anaximander]], whose pupil or friend he is said to have been.  

He held that the [[Air (classical element)|air]], with its variety of contents, its universal presence, its vague associations in popular fancy with the phenomena of life and growth, is the source of all that exists.  Everything is air at different degrees of density, and under the influence of heat, which expands, and of cold, which contracts its volume, it gives rise to the several phases of existence.  The process is gradual, and takes place in two directions, as heat or cold predominates.  In this way was formed a broad disk of earth, floating on the circumambient air.  Similar condensations produced the sun and stars; and the flaming state of these bodies is due to the velocity of their motions. He states: 

&quot;Just as our soul, being air, holds us together, so do breath and air encompass the whole world.&quot;


What makes the three [[Miletus|milesic]] philsophers, [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]] and Anaximenes, stand out is that the theoretical human has become a reality. The way of thinking has in its basic form moved away from the mythological thinking (or ''mythos'') and into the domain of the theoretical thinking (or ''logos''). From now on it is about explaining the universal and the general. Everything in the universe can now be approached by the thoughts of humans. This notably influenced the Pythagoreans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ancus Marcius''' (r. [[640 BC]]-[[616 BC]]), fourth of the [[Kings of Rome]], and possibly legendary.  Like [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]], his reputed grandfather, he was a friend of peace and religion, but was obliged to make war to defend his territories. He conquered the [[Latin_(disambiguation) | Latins]], and a number of them he settled on the [[Aventine Hill]] formed the origin of the [[Plebeians]]. He fortified the [[Janiculum]], threw a wooden bridge across the [[Tiber]], the [[pons sublicius]], founded the port of [[Ostia]], established salt-works and built a prison which was founded in 625 B.C. and was used to hold people until they decided what to do with them. Before this time, a popular punishment was to exile people.  

Ancus Marcius is merely a duplicate of Numa, as is shown by his second name, Numa Marcius, the confidant and pontifex of Numa, being no other than [[Numa Pompilius]] himself, represented as priest.  The identification with Ancus is shown by the legend which makes the latter a bridge-builder (pontifex), the constructor of the first wooden bridge over the Tiber. It is in the exercise of his priestly functions that the resemblance is most clearly shown. Like Numa, Ancus died a natural death. He was succeeded by [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]].

The '''Andaman Islands''' are a group of [[island]]s in the [[Bay of Bengal]], and are part of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] [[Union Territory]] of [[India]]. [[Port Blair]] is the chief community on the islands, and the administrative center of the Union Territory. The Andaman Islands form a single [[Districts of India|administrative district]] within the Union Territory, the [[Andaman district]] (the [[Nicobar district]] was separated and established as a new district in [[1974]]). The [[population]] of the Andamans was 314,084 in 2001.

==Physical Geography==
There are approximately 550 islands in the group, 26 of which are inhabited. They are located 950 [[kilometre|km]] from the mouth of the [[Hooghly River]], 193 km from [[Cape Negrais]] in [[Myanmar]], the nearest point of the mainland, and 547 km from the northern extremity of [[Sumatra]]. The length of the island chain is 352 km and its greatest width is 51 km. The total land area of the Andamans is 6408 [[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]].

The five chief islands over a distance of 251 km, are known collectively as [[Great Andaman]]. These are from north to south, [[North Andaman]], [[Middle Andaman]], [[South Andaman]], [[Baratang]] and [[Rutland Island]]. Four narrow straits part these islands, [[Austin Strait]], between North and Middle Andaman, [[Homfray's Strait]] between Middle Andaman and Baratang, and the north extremity of South Andaman, [[Middle Strait|Middle (or Andaman) Strait]] between Baratang and South Andaman and [[Macpherson Strait]] between South Andaman and Rutland Island. Of these only the last is navigable by ocean-going vessels.

Together with the chief islands are, on the extreme north, [[Landfall Islands]], separated by the navigable [[Cleugh Passage]]; [[Interview Island]], separated by the navigable [[Interview Passage]], off the West coast of the Middle Andaman; the [[Labyrinth Island]] off the southwest coast of the South Andaman, through which is the navigable [[Elphinstone Passage]]; [[Ritchie's Archipelago|Ritchie's (or the Andaman) Archipelago]] off the East coast of South Andaman and Baratang, separated by the wide and safe [[Diligent Strait]] and intersected by [[Kwangtung Strait]] and the [[Tadma Juru]] (Strait). Little Andaman, roughly 42 km by 26 km, forms the southern extremity of the whole group and lies 50 km south of Rutland Island across the Manners Strait, the main shipping route between the Andamans and the [[Chennai|Madras]] coast. Besides these are a great number of islets lying off the shores of the main islands. 

The principal outlying islands include the [[North Sentinel]], a dangerous island of about 73 km&amp;sup2;, lying about 29 km off the west coast of the South Andaman. About 29 km west of the Andamans are the dangerous Western Banks and Dalrymple Bank, rising to within a few [[fathom]]s of the surface of the sea and forming, with the two [[Sentinel Islands]], the tops of a line of submarine hills parallel to the Andamans. 

Andamans is the only place in India with an [[active volcano]]. [[Barren Island (Andaman Islands)|Barren Island]], northeast of Port Blair, became active in [[1990s]] after being quiescent for almost two hundred years. It erupted again in May 2005, experts pointing to the post-tsunami change in tectonic plates as the likely cause. The isolated extinct volcano of [[Narcondam Island|Narcondam]], rising 710 m out of the sea, is 114 km east of North Andaman. Plans are afoot to make volcano tourism popular. Also 64 km to the east is the [[Invisible Bank]], with one rock just awash, and 55 km southeast of Narcondam is a submarine hill rising to 689 m below the surface of the sea. Narcondam, Barren Island and the Invisible Bank, a great danger of these seas, are in a line almost parallel to the Andamans inclining towards them from north to south.

===Topography===
The Andamans, unlike the Lakshadweep-Chagos chain, are high volcanic islands, arising from a submerged mountain chain that follows the southward extension of the continental shelf.

Extensive fringing reefs exist here, as well as a 320 kilometers-long barrier reef on the west coast. Much of the wildlife on these islands is endemic, including 112 species of endemic birds. While poorly known scientifically, these reefs may prove to be the most diverse and best preserved in the Indian Ocean.

The islands forming Great Andaman consist of a mass of hills enclosing very narrow valleys, the whole covered by dense tropical jungle. The hills rise to a considerable elevation: 
the chief heights being in the North Andaman, Saddle Peak (732 m); in the Middle Andaman, Mount Diavolo behind Cuthbert Bay (511 m); in the South Andaman, Koiob (459 m), Mount Harriet (364 m) and the Cholunga range (324 m); and in Rutland Island, Ford's Peak (433 m). Little Andaman is practically flat. There are no rivers and few perennial streams in the islands. The whole of the Andamans and the outlying islands were completely surveyed topographically by the Indian Survey Department under Colonel Hobday in [[1883]]-[[1886]], and the surrounding seas were charted by Commander Carpenter in [[1888]]-[[1889]].

===Harbours===
The coasts of the Andamans are deeply indented, giving existence to a number of safe harbours, which are often surrounded by mangrove swamps. The chief harbours are (starting northwards from Port Blair, the great harbour of South Andaman) on the East coast: Port Meadows, Colebrooke Passage, Elphinstone Harbour (Homfray's Strait), Stewart Sound and Port Cornwallis. The last three are very large. On the West coast: Temple Sound, Interview Passage, Port Anson or Kwangtung Harbour (large), Port Campbell (large), Port Mouat and Macpherson Strait. There are many other safe anchorages about the coast, notably Shoal Bay and Kotara Anchorage in South Andaman; Cadell Bay and the Turtle Islands in North Andaman; and Outram Harbour and Kwangtung Strait in the archipelago.

==Geology==
The Andaman Islands and the [[Nicobar Islands]] to the south form part of a range of submarine mountains, 1130 km long, running from Cape Negrais in the Arakan Yoma range of Burma, to Achin Head in Sumatra. This range separates the Bay of Bengal from the Andaman Sea, and it contains much that is geologically characteristic of the Arakan Yoma. The older rocks are early Tertiary or late Cretaceous. The newer rocks are in Ritchie's Archipelago chiefly, and contain fossils of radiolarians and foraminifera. There is coral along the coasts everywhere, and the Sentinel Islands are composed of the newer rocks with a superstructure of coral. A theory of a still continuing subsidence of the islands was formed by Kurz in [[1866]] and confirmed by Oldham in [[1884]]. Signs of its continuance are found on the east coast in several places.

==Climate==
The climate of the Andamans themselves may be described as normal for tropical islands of similar latitude. It is always warm, but with sea-breezes; very hot when the sun is northing; irregular rainfall, but usually dry during the north-east, and very wet during the south-west monsoon. Not only does the rainfall at one place vary from year to year, but there is an extraordinary difference for places quite close to one another. The Islands are barely affected by the often disastrous cyclones that come up the Bay of Bengal, though they are within the influence of practically every one. The Andamans thus were once of great importance for monitoring weather in the region for the benefit of the Indian mainland and ships at sea in the Indian Ocean. A meteorological station was established at Port Blair in [[1868]].

==Flora==
A section of the Forest Department of India was established in the Andamans in [[1883]], and in the neighbourhood of Port Blair 400 km&amp;sup2; were set apart for regular forest operations to be carried on by convict labour. The chief timber of indigenous growth is [[padouk]] ''(Pterocarpus dalbergioides'') used for buildings, boats, furniture, fine joinery and all purposes to which teak, mahogany, hickory, oak and ash are applied. This tree was widespread and formed a valuable export to European markets. Other first-class timbers are koko (''Albizzia lebbek''), white chuglam (''Terminalia bialata''), black chugiam (''Myristica irya''), marble or zebra wood (''Diospyros kurzii'') and satin-wood (''Murraya exotica''), which differs from the satin-wood of Ceylon (''Chloroxylon swietenia''.) All of these timbers are used for furniture and similar fine purposes, but many are now endangered. In addition there are a number of second- and third-class timbers, which are used locally and for export to Calcutta. Gangaw (''Messua ferrea'') the Assam iron-wood, is suitable for railway sleepers; and didu (''Bombax insigne'') is used for tea-boxes and packing-cases. 

Among the introduced flora are tea, Siberian coffee, cocoa, Ceará rubber (which has not done well), Manila hemp, teak, cocoanut and a number of ornamental trees, fruit-trees, vegetables and garden plants. Tea is grown in considerable quantities and the cultivation was once under a department of the penal settlement. The general character of the forests is Burmese with an admixture of Malay types. Great mangrove swamps supply unlimited fire-wood of the best quality. The great peculiarity of Andaman flora is that, with the exception of the Cocos islands, no coconut palms are found in the archipelago.

==Fauna==
The Andamans are home to a wide variety of bird, animal and marine life, with many [[species]] [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the islands, or even locations on the islands, to a large degree owing to the islands' relative isolation from nearby landmasses. Several of these species are also to be found in the Nicobar islands, whilst others are found only in one or the other island groups.

Endemic [[bird]] species include the [[Nicobar scrubfowl]] (''Megapodius nicobariensis'', a type of  [[megapode]]), [[Nicobar green imperial pigeon]] (''Ducula aenea nicobarica''), and the [[Nicobar emerald dove]] (''Chancophaps indica augusta''). 

[[Reptile|Reptilian]] species include the [[saltwater crocodile]] (''Crocodylus porusus'') which nests in [[estuary|estuarine]] regions. Several species of endangered [[Sea turtle]] (family ''Cheloniidae'') are also found in the islands' waters, such as [[Hawksbill turtle]]s (''Eretmochelys imbricata''), [[Leatherback Sea Turtle]]s (''Dermochelys coriacea''), and [[Olive Ridley]] sea turtles (''Lepidochelys olivacea''). Terrestrial- and arboreal-dwelling reptiles include several species of [[lizard]], such as the [[Coryphophylax subcristatus|Bay Island forest lizard]] (''Coryphophylax subcristatus''), a species from the [[Agamidae]] Family of lizards.

Marine mammals include [[Dugong]] (''Dugong dugon''), Finless porpoise (''Neophocaena hocaenoides''), and [[Blainville's Beaked Whale]] (''Mesoplodon densirostris''), a wide-ranging but non-migratory species of [[mesoplodont whale]]s. Rich fish and invertebrate faunas exist on the reefs; fish families include Labridae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, and Blenniidae. Nine species of seagrass are also present.

Fish are very numerous and many species are endemic to the Andaman seas. Turtles are abundant and supply the Calcutta market. Of imported animals, cattle, goats, asses and dogs thrive well, ponies and horses indifferently, and sheep badly, though some success has been achieved in breeding them.

==History==
It is uncertain whether any of the names of the islands given by [[Ptolemy]] ought to be attached to the Andamans; yet it is probable that his name itself is traceable in the Alexandrian geographer. Andaman first appears distinctly in the Arab notices of the [[9th century]], already quoted. But it seems possible that the tradition of marine nomenclature had never perished; that the ''Agathou daimonos nesos'' was really a misunderstanding of some form like ''Agdaman'', while ''Nesoi Baroussai'' survived as ''Lanka Balus'', the name applied by the Arabs to the [[Nicobar Islands]]. The islands are briefly noticed by [[Marco Polo]], who may have seen them without visiting, under the name ''Angamanain'', seemingly an Arabic dual, &quot;the two Angamans&quot;, with the exaggerated  picture of the natives as dog-faced [[anthropophagi]]. 

Another notice occurs in the story of [[Nicolo Conti]] (c. 1440), who explains the name to mean ''Island of Gold'', and speaks of a lake with peculiar virtues as existing in it. The name is probably derived from the [[Malay language|Malay]] ''Handuman'', coming from the ancient ''Hanuman'' (monkey god). Later travellers repeat the stories, too well founded, of the &quot;ferocious hostility&quot; of the people; of whom we may instance [[Cesare Federici]] ([[1569]]), whose narrative is given in ''Ramusio'', vol. iii. (only in the later editions), and in ''Purchas''. A good deal is also told of them in the vulgar and gossiping but useful work of [[Captain A. Hamilton]] ([[1727]]). 

In [[1788]]-[[1789]] the government of Bengal sought to establish in the Andamans a penal colony, associated with a harbour of refuge. Two officers, Colebrooke of the Bengal Engineers, and Blair of the sea service, were sent to survey and report. In the sequel the settlement was established by Captain Blair, in September [[1789]], on Chatham Island, in the southeast bay of the Great Andaman, now called Port Blair, but then Port Cornwallis. There was much sickness, and after two years, urged by [[Admiral Cornwallis]], the government transferred the colony to the northeast part of Great Andaman, where a naval arsenal was to be established. With the colony the name also of Port Cornwallis was transferred to this new locality. The scheme did ill; and in [[1796]] the government put an end to it, owing to the great mortality and the embarrassments of maintenance. The settlers were finally removed in May [[1796]]. 

In [[1824]] Port Cornwallis was the ''rendezvous'' of the fleet carrying the army to the first Burmese war. In [[1839]], Dr Helfer, a German savant employed by the Indian government, having landed in the islands, was attacked and killed. In [[1844]] the troop-ships ''Briton'' and ''Runnymede'' were driven ashore here, almost close together. The natives showed hostility, killing all stragglers. Outrages on shipwrecked crews continued so rife that the question of occupation had to be taken up again; and in [[1855]] a project was formed for such a settlement, embracing a convict establishment. This was interrupted by the [[Indian Mutiny of 1857]], but as soon as the neck of that revolt was broken, it became more urgent than ever to provide such a resource, on account of the great number of prisoners falling into British hands. Lord Canning, therefore, in November [[1857]], sent a commission, headed by Dr F. Mouat, to examine and report. The commission reported favourably, selecting as a site Blair's original Port Cornwallis, but pointing out and avoiding the vicinity of a salt swamp which seemed to have been pernicious to the old colony. To avoid confusion, the name of Port Blair was given to the new settlement. 

For some time sickness and mortality were excessively large, but the [[Land reclamation|reclamation of swamp]] and clearance of jungle on an extensive scale by Colonel Henry Man when in charge ([[1868]]-[[1870]]), had a most beneficial effect, and the health of the settlement has since been notable. The Andaman colony obtained a tragical notoriety from the murder of the viceroy, the earl of Mayo, by a Muslim convict, when on a visit to the settlement on [[February 8]], [[1872]]. In the same year the two groups, Andaman and Nicobar, the occupation of the latter also having been forced on the British government (in [[1869]]) by the continuance of outrage upon vessels, were united under a chief commissioner residing at Port Blair.

The Andaman islands were later occupied by Japan during [[World War II]]. The islands were nominally put under the authority of the [[Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind]] of Netaji [[Subhash Chandra Bose]]. Netaji visited the islands during the war, and renamed them as Shaheed (Martyr) &amp; Swaraj (Self-rule). General Loganathan of the [[Indian National Army]] , was Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands which had been annexed to the Provisional Government.  After the end of the war they briefly returned to British control, before becoming part of the newly independent state of India.

On [[26 December]] [[2004]] the coast of the Andaman Islands was devastated by a 10 metre high [[tsunami]] following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].

===Penal Settlement===
The point of enduring interest as regards the Andamans is the [[penal colony]], the object of which is to turn the life-sentence and few long-sentence convicts, who alone are sent to the settlement, into honest, self-respecting men and women, by leading them along a continuous course of practice in self-help and self-restraint, and by offering them every inducement to take advantage of that practice. After ten years' graduated labour the convict is given a ticket-of-leave and becomes self-supporting. He can farm, keep cattle, and marry or send for his family, but he cannot leave the settlement or be idle. With approved conduct, however, he may be absolutely released after twenty to twenty-five years in the settlement; and throughout that time, though possessing no civil rights, a [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] procedure controls all punishments inflicted upon him, and he is as secure of obtaining justice as if free. There is an unlimited variety of work for the labouring convicts, and some of the establishments are on a large scale. Very few experts are employed in supervision; practically everything is directed by the officials, who themselves have first to learn each trade. Under the chief commissioner, who is the supreme head of the settlement, are a deputy and a staff of assistant superintendents and overseers, almost all Europeans, and sub-overseers, who are natives of India. All the petty supervising establishments are composed of convicts. 

The garrison consists of 140 British and 300 Indian troops, with a few local European volunteers. The police are organized as a military battalion 643 strong. The number of convicts has somewhat diminished of late years and in [[1901]] stood at 11,947. The total population of the settlement, consisting of convicts, their guards, the supervising, clerical and departmental staff, with the families of the latter, also a certain number of ex-convicts and trading settlers and their families, numbered 16,106. The labouring convicts are distributed among four jails and nineteen stations; the self-supporters in thirty-eight villages. The elementary education of the convicts' children is compulsory. There are four hospitals, each under a resident medical officer, under the general supervision of a senior officer of the Indian medical service, and medical aid is given free to the whole population. The net annual cost of the settlement to the government is about six pounds per convict. The harbour of Port Blair is well supplied with buoys and harbour lights, and is crossed by ferries at fixed intervals, while there are several launches for hauling local traffic. On Ross Island there is a lighthouse visible for 19 miles. A complete system of signalling by night and day on the Morse system is worked by the police. Local posts are frequent, but there is no telegraph and the mails are irregular.

The above accounts, written while Britain still controlled India, may leave the impression that these settlements were a model of progressive penal reform. Indian accounts, however, paint a different picture. From the time of its development in [[1858]] under the direction of [[James Pattison Walker]], and in response to the mutiny and rebellion of the previous year, the settlement was first and foremost a repository for political prisoners. The [[Cellular Jail]] at Port Blair when completed in [[1910]] included 698 cells designed to better accommodate solitary confinement; each cell measured 4.5 by 2.7 metres with a single ventilation window 3 metres above the floor. [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]] had been one of the illustrious prisoners there. The Viper Chain Gang Jail on Viper Island was reserved for troublemakers, and was also the site of hangings. In the 20th century it became a convenient place to house India's freedom fighters, and it was here that on [[December 30]], [[1943]] during Japanese occupation, that [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] first raised the flag of Indian independence. The penal colony was closed on [[August 15]], [[1947]] when India gained its freedom. It has since served as a museum to the freedom fighters.

==Demographics==
The population of the Andaman Islands has increased rapidly, from roughly 2000 in 1901 to 157,821 in 1981, 241,453 in 1991, and 314,239 in 2001. These increases are mostly attributable to migration from the Indian mainland. It is estimated that less than ten percent of the population of the Andaman Islands is indigenous Andamanese including in 2005, only 99 [[Onge]], 250 [[Sentinelese]], 39 [[Andamanese]] and 350 [[Jarawa (Andaman Islands)|Jarawas]].

==Indigenous Andamanese==    
[[Image:Andaman tribal &amp; linguistic map.jpg|thumb|300px|Ethnolinguistic map of the precolonial Andaman Islands]]
The various [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Andamanese]] peoples [[list of subsistence techniques|subsisted]] mostly as [[hunter-gatherer]] communities, supplemented by [[fishing]] and limited [[agriculture|agricultural]] practices. The Sentinelese, Önge, and Jarawa peoples continue in this way of life in the southern part of the archipelago. 

The indigenous Andamanese are slightly built, dark-skinned, with tightly-curled hair, and physically resemble the [[Semang]] of the [[Malay Peninsula]] and the [[Aeta]] of the [[Philippines]]. The Andamanese, Semang, and Aeta are probably descendants of a people who were more widespread in [[Southeast Asia]] before they were displaced or assimilated by the ancestors of today's [[Austronesian]]-speakers.

Their antiquity is attested by the remains found in their kitchen-[[midden]]s. These are of great age, and rise sometimes to a height exceeding 5 metres. The fossil shells, pottery and primitive stone implements, found alike at the base and at the surface of these middens, show that the habits of the islanders have varied little since the remote past, and lead to the belief that the Andamans were settled by their present inhabitants some time during the [[Pleistocene]] period, and certainly no later than the [[Neolithic]] age. The oldest [[archaeological]] evidence for occupation yet obtained is dated to [[3rd century BC|2,200 years ago]]; however, the investigations which have been made are not extensive, and it is most likely that much earlier dates will be attested. 

The Andamans may have been linked to Myanmar by a land bridge during the [[ice age]]s, and it is possible that the ancestors of the Andamanese reached the islands without crossing the sea. Whether an original sea-crossing was required or not, linguistic and genetic studies indicate that the Andamanese peoples have lived in almost complete isolation for 30,000 to 70,000 years. For example, a report in the journal &quot;Science&quot; [Vol 308, Issue 5724, 996, [[13 May]] [[2005]]] by Thangaraj et al. identifies M31 and M32 [[mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] types among indigenous Andamanese, which show that these populations became genetically isolated about 50,000 to 70,000 years ago, apparently after their initial migration from Africa.

The indigenous Andamanese spoke several related languages, the [[Andamanese languages]], a distinct [[language family]] unrelated to languages found outside the islands. Of the 13 languages spoken at the beginning of the century, nine are now extinct. The extinct languages were spoken on Great Andaman, and the Great Andamanese now mostly speak [[Hindi]]. The [[Jarawa (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]], [[Onge|Önge]], and [[Sentinelese]] mostly speak their own languages, and limit their contact with outsiders.

The earliest European notice of the Andamanese is in a remarkable collection of early [[Arab]] notes on India and China from the year [[851]] which influenced the view of this people until modern times. The traditional charge of [[cannibalism]] has been very persistent; but it is entirely denied by the islanders themselves, and is now and probably always has been untrue. Of their massacres of shipwrecked crews, there is no doubt, but that the policy of conciliation has secured a friendly reception for shipwrecked crews at any port of the islands.

The historic population of the islands is difficult to estimate, but it has probably always been small. The estimated total at a census taken in [[1901]] was only 2,000. Though all descended from one stock, there are twelve distinct [[Tribes of India|tribes]] of the Andamanese, each with its own clearly-defined locality, its own distinct variety of the one fundamental language and to a certain extent its own separate habits. Every tribe is divided into fairly well defined septs. The tribal feeling may be expressed as friendly within the tribe, courteous to other Andamanese if known, hostile to every stranger, Andamanese or other. 

The Andaman languages are extremely interesting from the philological standpoint. They are [[agglutinative]] in nature, show hardly any signs of syntactical growth though every indication of long etymological growth, give expression to only the most direct and the simplest thought, and are purely colloquial and wanting in the modifications always necessary for communication by writing. The sense is largely eked out by manner and action. Mincopie is the first word in Colebrooke's vocabulary for &quot;Andaman Island, or native country&quot;, and the term - though probably a mishearing on Colebrooke's part for Mongebe (&quot;I am an Onge&quot;, i.e. a member of the Onge tribe) - has thus become a persistent book-name for the people.

Another division of the natives is into [[Aryauto]] or long-shore-men, and the [[Eremtaga]] or jungle-dwellers. The habits and capacities of these two differ, owing to surroundings, irrespectively of tribe. Yet again the Andamanese can be grouped according to certain salient characteristics: the forms of the bows and arrows, of the canoes, of ornaments and utensils, of [[tattoo]]ing and of language. 

The average height of males is 149 cm; of females, 137 cm. The only artificial deformity is a depression of the skull, chiefly among one of the southern tribes, caused by the pressure of a strap used for carrying loads. 

The women's heads are shaved entirely and the men's into fantastic patterns. Yellow and [[red ochre]] mixed with grease are coarsely smeared over the bodies, grey in coarse patterns and white in fine patterns resembling tattoo marks. Tattooing is of two distinct varieties. In the south the body is slightly cut by women with small flakes of glass or quartz in zigzag or lineal patterns downwards. In the north it is deeply cut by men with pig-arrows in lines across the body. 

The male is said to reach adulthood when about fifteen years of age, typically marries when about twenty-six, and lives onto sixty or sixty-five if he reaches old age. Except as to the marrying age, these figures fairly apply to women. Before marriage, free intercourse between the sexes is the rule, though certain conventional precautions are taken to prevent it. Marriages rarely produce more than three children and often none at all. Divorce is rare, unfaithfulness after marriage uncommon and incest virtually unknown. 

By preference the Andamanese are exogamous as regards sept and endogamous as regards tribe.

There is no idea of government, but in each sept there is a head, who has attained that position by degrees on account of some tacitly admitted superiority and commands a limited respect and some obedience. The young are deferential to their elders. Offences are punished by the aggrieved party. Property is communal and theft is only recognized as to things of absolute necessity, such as arrows, pork and fire. Fire is the one thing they are really careful about, not knowing how to renew it. A very rude barter exists between tribes of the same group in regard to articles not locally obtainable. 

The religion consists of beliefs in spirits of the wood, the sea, disease and ancestors, and of avoidance of acts traditionally displeasing to them. There is neither worship nor propitiation. An anthropomorphic deity, [[Puluga]], is the cause of all things, but it is not necessary to propitiate him. There is an idea that the &quot;soul&quot; will go somewhere after death, but there is no heaven nor hell, nor idea of a corporeal resurrection. There is much faith in dreams, and in the utterances of certain &quot;wise men&quot;, who practise an embryonic magic and witchcraft. 

The great amusement of the Andamanese is a formal night dance, but they are also fond of games. The bows differ altogether with each group, but the same two kinds of arrows are in general use: (1) long and ordinary for fishing and other purposes; (2) short with a detachable head fastened to the shaft by a thong, which quickly brings pigs up short when shot in the thick jungle. Bark provides material for string, while baskets and mats are neatly and stoutly made from canes and buckets out of bamboo and wood. 

None of the tribes ever ventures out of sight of land, and they have no idea of steering by sun or stars. Their canoes are simply hollowed out of trunks with the adze and in no other way, and it is the smaller ones that are outrigged; they do not last long and are not good sea-boats. The story of raids on Car Nicobar, out of sight across a stormy and sea-rippled channel, must be discredited. 

Honour is shown to an adult when he dies by wrapping him in a cloth and placing him on a platform in a tree instead of burying him. At such a time the encampment is deserted for three months.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexander Anderson''' (c. [[1582]]-[[1620]]?) was a Scottish [[mathematician]] born in [[Aberdeen]].  In his youth he went to the continent and taught mathematics in [[Paris]], where he published or edited, between the years [[1612]] and [[1619]], various [[geometric]] and [[algebraic]] tracts.

He was selected by the executors of [[François Viète]] to revise and edit Viete's manuscript works. The works of Anderson amount to six thin quarto volumes, and as the last of them was published in [[1619]], it is probable that the author died soon after that year, but the precise date is unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andocides''', or '''Andokidès ''', ([[440 BC|440]]&amp;ndash;[[390 BC]]) one of the ten [[Attic orators]].

He was implicated during the [[Peloponnesian War]] in the mutilation of the [[Herms]] on the eve of the departure of the [[Sicilian expedition|Athenian expedition]] against [[Sicily]] in [[415 BC]]. Although he saved his life by turning informer, he was condemned to partial loss of civil rights and went into exile.  He engaged in commercial pursuits, and returned to [[Athens]] under the general amnesty that followed the restoration of the democracy ([[403 BC]]), and filled some important offices.  In [[391 BC]] he was one of the ambassadors sent to [[Sparta]] to discuss peace terms, but the negotiations failed. Oligarchical in his sympathies, he offended his own party and was distrusted by the democrats. Andocides was no professional orator; his style is simple and lively, natural but inartistic. 

'''Speeches extant'''--''De Reditu,'' his plea for his return and removal of civil disabilities; ''De Mysteriis,'' his defence against the charge of impiety in attending the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]; ''De Pace,'' advocating peace with Sparta; ''Contra [[Alcibiades|Alcibiadem]],'' generally considered spurious.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andrew II''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''II. András'' or ''II. Endre'', [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Ondrej II'') ([[1175]]-[[1235]]) was a son of [[Béla III of Hungary|Béla III]] and succeeded his nephew, the infant [[Ladislaus III of Hungary|Ladislaus III]], as King of Hungary in [[1205]].

Few other royal reigns were as detrimental to the Hungarian realm as Andrew's. Valiant, enterprising, pious as he was, all these fine qualities were ruined by a reckless good nature which never thought of the future. He declared in a decree that the generosity of a king should be limitless, and he followed this principle throughout his reign. He gave away everything - money, villages, domains, whole counties - to the utter impoverishment of the treasury, thereby rendering the crown, for the first time in Hungarian history, dependent upon the great [[nobility]] eager for personal gain. In all matters of  government, Andrew was equally reckless and haphazard. He was directly responsible for the beginnings of the feudal anarchy which led to the extinction of the [[Árpáds|Árpád]] [[dynasty]] at the end of the [[13th century]]. The great nobles did not even respect the lives of the royal family, for Andrew was recalled from a futile attempt to reconquer [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] through the murder of his first wife [[Gertrude of Meran]] in [[1213]] by rebellious nobles jealous of the influence of her relatives. 

In [[1215]] he married Iolanthe (Yolande) of [[France]], but in [[1217]] was compelled by [[Pope Honorius III]] to lead the [[Fifth Crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]], which he undertook in hopes of being elected [[Latin Empire|Latin emperor]] of [[Constantinople]].  The crusade was not popular in Hungary, but Andrew contrived to collect 15,000 men together, whom he led to [[Venice]]. After the surrender of Hungarian claims on Zara ([[Zadar]]), about two-thirds of the crusaders were conveyed to [[Acre (city)|Acre]]. Nevertheless the whole expedition was a forlorn hope. The [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] was by this time reduced to a strip of coast about 440 mi² in extent, and after a drawn battle with the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] on the [[Jordan River]] on [[November 10]] 1217 and fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the [[Lebanon]] and on [[Mount Tabor]], Andrew started home ([[January 18]], [[1218]]) through Antioch ([[Antakya]]), Iconium ([[Konya]]), Constantinople, and [[Bulgaria]]. On his return he found the feudal barons in the ascendant, and they extorted from him the [[Golden Bull of 1222|Golden Bull]].

Andrew's last exploit was to defeat an invasion of [[Frederick II of Austria|Frederick II]] of [[Austria]] in [[1234]]. That same year he married his third wife, Beatrice of [[Este]].

==Family==

Andrew had five children by his first wife, Gertrude:
# Maria of Hungary (1203-1221), married Tsar [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]]
# [[Bela IV of Hungary]] (1206-1270)
# [[Elisabeth of Hungary|Saint Elizabeth of Hungary]] (1207-1231)
# Kálmán, Duke of [[Croatia]] (1208-1241)
# András, King of Galicia (1210-1234)

From his second marriage to Yolande de Courtney, he had one daughter:
# Jolán (Yolande) of Hungary (1215-1251), married [[James I of Aragon]]

Andrew's third marriage to Beatrice d'Este produced one posthumous son:
# István (1236-1271), who was himself father of King [[Andrew III of Hungary]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding''''' is a book by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[philosopher]] [[David Hume]], published in [[1748]].

This is the book that woke [[Immanuel Kant]] from his self-described &quot;dogmatic slumber&quot;. It was a simplification of an earlier effort, Hume's ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', published anonymously in [[London]] in [[1739]]&amp;ndash;[[1740]]. Hume was disappointed with the reception of the ''Treatise'' (it &quot;fell dead-born from the press&quot;, as he put it) and so tried again to get his ideas before the public in this ''Enquiry''. Among the changes from the ''Treatise'' included a removal of Hume's theories of [[personal identity]].

== Summary ==
The argument of the Enquiry proceeds following these steps:

# '''Of the different species of philosophy.''' In the first section of the Enquiry, Hume provides a rough introduction to philosophy as a whole. For Hume, philosophy can be split into two general parts: natural and moral philosophy. By &quot;moral philosophy&quot; Hume means the philosophy of human nature, which investigates both actions and thoughts. He emphasizes in this section, by way of warning, that philosophers with nuanced thoughts will likely be cast aside in favor of those who weild flowery rhetoric. However, he insists, precision helps art and craft of all kinds.
# '''Of the origin of ideas.''' In this section, Hume discusses the distinction between impressions and ideas. By &quot;impressions&quot;, he means sensations, while by &quot;ideas&quot;, he means memories and imaginings. According to Hume, the difference between the two is that ideas are less vivacious than impressions. Along with the empiricist's program, he argues that the source of all ideas are impressions, combined with the operations of the imagination. One noteworthy consequence which he gives some treatment of is the &quot;missing blue shade&quot; problem.
# '''Of the association of ideas.''' In this chapter, Hume discusses how thoughts tend to come in sequences, as in trains of thought. He explains that there are at least three kinds of associations between ideas: resemblance, contiguity, and cause-and-effect. He argues that there must be some universal principle that must account for the various sorts of connections that exist between ideas, but does not immediately show what this principle might be.
# '''Skeptical doubts concerning the operations of the understanding (in two parts)'''. In the first part, Hume discusses how the objects of inquiry are either &quot;relations of ideas&quot; or &quot;matters of fact&quot;, which is roughly the distinction between [[analytic proposition|analytic]] and [[synthetic proposition]]s. In part two, Hume inquires into how anyone can justifiably believe that experience yields any conclusions about the world. He shows how a satisfying argument for experience can be based neither on principles (since no principle exists) nor experience (since that would be a [[circular argument]]).
# '''Skeptical solution of these doubts (in two parts).''' For Hume, we assume that experience tells us something about the world because of habit or custom, which human nature forces us to take seriously. This is also, presumably, the principle that organizes the connections between ideas. Indeed, one of the many famous passages of the ''Enquiry'' was on the topic of the incorrigibility of human custom. Hume wrote:''&quot;The great subverter of Pyrrhonism or the excessive principles of skepticism is action, and employment, and the occupations of common life. These principles may flourish and triumph in the schools; where it is, indeed, difficult, if not impossible, to refute them. But as soon as they leave the shade, and by the presence of the real objects, which actuate our passions and sentiments, are put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our nature, they vanish like smoke, and leave the most determined skeptic in the same condition as other mortals.&quot;''
# '''Of probability.'''
# '''Of the idea of necessary connection (in two parts).'''
# '''Of liberty and necessity (in two parts).'''
# '''Of the reason of animals (comparable to man).'''
# '''Of miracles (in two parts).'''
# '''Of a particular providence and of a future state.'''
# '''Of the academical or sceptical philosophy (in three parts).''' The first section of the last chapter is organized as an outline of various skeptical arguments. The treatment includes the arguments of atheism, Cartesian skepticism, &quot;light&quot; skepticism, and rationalist critiques of empiricism. Hume shows that even light skepticism leads to crushing doubts about the world which - while ultimately are more philosophically justifiable - may only be combatted through the non-philosophical adherance to custom or habit. He ends the section with his own reservations towards Cartesian and Lockean epistemologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andrew of Longjumeau''' (also Longumeau, Lonjumel, etc.) was a [[13th century]] [[France|French]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], [[exploration|explorer]] and diplomat.

He accompanied the mission that was sent by [[Pope Innocent IV]] to the [[Mongols]] in [[1247]] under Friar Ascelin or Anselm, which was chronicled by [[Simon of St Quentin]]. At the [[Tatars]]' camp near [[Kars]] he met a certain David, who next year ([[1248]]) appeared at the court of King [[Louis IX of France]] in [[Cyprus]].  Andrew, who was now with Saint Louis, interpreted David's message to the King, a real or pretended offer of alliance from the Mongol general [[Ilchikdai]] (Ilchikadai), and a proposal of a joint attack upon the [[Islam]]ic powers for the conquest of [[Syria]].

In reply to this the French sovereign dispatched Andrew as his ambassador to the great [[Guyuk|Kuyuk Khan]]; with Longjumeau went his brother (a [[monk]]) and several others — John Goderiche, John of Carcassonne, Herbert &quot;Le Sommelier,&quot; Gerbert of Sens, Robert (a clerk), a certain William, and an unnamed clerk of [[Poissy]].

The party set out about [[February 16]], [[1249]], with letters from King Louis and the [[papal legate]], and rich presents, including a chapel-tent, lined with scarlet cloth and embroidered with sacred pictures.  From Cyprus they went to the port of [[Antioch]] in Syria, and thence travelled for a year to the Khan's court, going ten leagues (55.56 kilometers) per day.  Their route led them through [[Iran|Persia]], along the southern and eastern shores of the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] (whose inland character, unconnected with the outer ocean, their journey helped to demonstrate), and probably through [[Talas, Kyrgyzstan|Talas]], north-east of [[Tashkent]].

On arrival at the supreme Mongol court — either that on the [[Imyl river]] (near [[Lake Ala-kul]] and the present Russo-Chinese frontier in the [[Altai]]), or more probably at or near [[Karakorum]] itself, south-west of [[Lake Baikal]] — Andrew found Kuyuk Khan dead, poisoned, as the envoy supposed, by [[Batu Khan]]'s agents. The regent-mother [[Ogul Gaimish]] (the &quot;Camus&quot; of [[William of Rubruck]]) seems to have received and dismissed him with presents and a letter for Louis IX, the latter a fine specimen of Mongol insolence.  But it is certain that before the friar had quitted &quot;Tartary&quot; [[Mangu Khan]], Kuyuk's successor, had been elected.

Andrew's report to his sovereign, whom he rejoined in [[1251]] at [[Caesarea Palaestina|Caesarea]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], appears to have been a mixture of history and fable; the latter affects his narrative of the Mongols' rise to greatness, and the struggles of their leader, evidently [[Genghis Khan]], with [[Prester John]]; it is still more evident in the position assigned to the [[Tatars]] homeland, close to the prison of [[Gog and Magog]].  On the other hand, the envoy's account of Tatar manners is fairly accurate, and his statements about [[Mongolia|Mongol]] Christianity and its prosperity, though perhaps exaggerated (e.g. as to the 800 chapels on wheels in the nomadic host), are based on fact.

Mounds of bones marked his road, witnesses of devastations which other historians record in detail. He found [[Christianity|Christian]] prisoners, from [[Germany]] in the heart of &quot;Tartary&quot; (at Talas), and was compelled to observe the ceremony of passing between two fires, as a bringer of gifts to a dead Khan, gifts which were of course treated by the Mongols as evidence of submission.  This insulting behaviour, and the language of the letter with which Andrew reappeared, marked the mission a failure: King Louis, says [[Jean de Joinville|Joinville]], &quot;''se repenti fort''&quot; (&quot;felt very sorry&quot;).

We only know of Andrew through references in other writers: see especially [[William of Rubruck]]'s in ''Recueil de voyages'', iv. (Paris, 1839), pp. 261, 265, 279, 296, 310, 353, 363, 370; Joinville, ed. Francisque Michel (1858, etc.), pp. 142, etc.; Jean Pierre Sarrasin, in same vol., pp. 254–235; [[William of Nangis]] in ''Recueil des historiens des Gaules'', xx. 359–367; [[Charles de Rémusat|Rémusat]], ''Mémoires sur les relations politiques des princes chrétiens… avec les… Mongols'' (1822, etc.), p. 52.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andronicus III Palaeologus''' (c. [[1296]] - [[June 15]], [[1341]]), [[Byzantine emperor]], was the son of [[Michael IX Palaeologus]] and Princess [[Rita of Armenia]].

His conduct during his youth was so violent that, after the death of his father Michael in [[1320]], his grandfather [[Andronicus II]] resolved to deprive him of his right to the crown.  Andronicus rebelled; he had a powerful party, and the first period of civil war ended in his being crowned and accepted as colleague by his grandfather, [[1325]].  The quarrel broke out again and, notwithstanding the help of the [[Bulgaria]]ns, the older emperor was compelled to abdicate in [[1328]].

His chief minister during this period was John Cantacuzenus, later Emperor [[John VI Cantacuzenus|John VI]].  During his reign Andronicus III was engaged in constant war, chiefly with the [[Ottoman Turks]], who greatly extended their territory, conquering almost all of [[Asia Minor]] before his coming to power. Under Andronicus's rule, [[Nicaea]] fell to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[emir]] [[Orhan I]] in 1331, with [[Nicomedia]] following in 1337. After that, in Asia Minor only Philadelphia and a handful of ports remained under Byzantine control. He annexed large regions in [[Thessaly]] and [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], but they were lost few years after his death in period of new civil war to the rising power of [[Serbia]] under [[Stefan Dusan]].  Andronicus worked on the reorganization of the navy, and recovered [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], [[Phocaea]], and [[Chios]] from the [[Genoa|Genoese]].  He died in [[1341]], and was succeeded by his son, [[John V Palaeologus|John V]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andronicus II Palaeologus''' ([[1260]] &amp;ndash; [[February 13]], [[1332]]), [[Byzantine emperor]], was the elder son of [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]], whom he succeeded in [[1282]]. He ruled until 1328.

He allowed the fleet, which his father had organized, to fall into decay; and the empire was thus less able than ever to resist the exacting demands of the rival powers of [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]].

During his reign the [[Ottoman Turks]] under [[Osman I|Osman]] conquered nearly the whole of [[Bithynia]]; and to resist them the emperor called in the aid of the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[Roger de Flor]], who commanded a body of [[Aragon]]ese and [[Catalonia|Catalan]] adventurers known as [[Almogavars]]. The Turks were defeated, but Roger was found to be nearly as formidable an enemy to the imperial power. He was [[assassination|assassinated]] by Andronicus's son and colleague (sometimes referred to as emperor Michael IX, though he never ruled in his own name), in [[1305]]. His adventurers (known as the [[Catalan Grand Company]] or ''Companyia Catalana'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) declared war upon Andronicus, and, after devastating [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], conquered the [[Duchy of Athens]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]].

From [[1320]] onwards the emperor was engaged in war with his grandson [[Andronicus III|Andronicus]]. He abdicated in [[1328]] and died in [[1332]].

In [[1274]] he married Anne of Hungary, a daughter of King [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen V]], with whom he had two sons:
# [[Michael IX Palaeologus]]
# Constantine  
After she died in [[1281]] Andronicus married a daughter of Wilhelm IX of Montferrat, Yolande, who took the name of Irene and bore him:
# John (c. 1286 - 1308) 
# [[Theodore I of Montferrat|Theodore I, Marquis of Montferrat]] (1291-1338) 
# Demetrius (d. after 1343)
# Simonis (1294 - after 1336) (married King of [[Serbia]] [[Stefan Milutin|Stephen II Urosh Milutin]])
He also had at least two illegitimate daughters:
# Irene, wife of John II despot of [[Thessaly]] 
# Maria, wife of [[Tokhta]] Khan of the [[Golden Horde]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ByzantineBillonTrachy.jpg|frame|Billon trachy (a cup-shaped coin) of Andronicus I Comnenus (1183-1185)]]

'''Andronicus I Comnenus''' (c.1118 - September 12th 1185), [[Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperor]], son of prince [[Isaac Comnenus (d. 1152)|Isaac Comnenus]], and grandson of [[Alexius I Comnenus|Alexius I Comnenus]], was born about the beginning of the [[12th century]].  His birth has been estimated to c. [[1118]]. He was endowed by nature with the most remarkable gifts both of mind and body.  He was handsome and eloquent, but licentious; and at the same time active, hardy, courageous, a great general and an able politician.

Andronicus' early years were spent in alternate pleasure and military service.  In [[1141]] he was taken captive by the [[Seljuk Turks]] and remained in their hands for a year.  On being ransomed he went to [[Constantinople]], where was held the court of his cousin, the emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus|Manuel]], with whom he was a great favourite.  Here the charms of his niece, the princess Eudoxia, attracted him.  She became his mistress, while her sister Theodora stood in a similar relation to the emperor Manuel.  

In [[1152]], accompanied by Eudoxia, he set out for an important command in [[Cilicia]].  Failing in his principal enterprise, an attack upon [[Mopsuestia]], he returned, but was again appointed to the command of a province.  This second post he seems also to have left after a short interval, for he appeared again in [[Constantinople]], and narrowly escaped death at the hands of the brothers of Eudoxia.  

About this time ([[1153]]) a conspiracy against the emperor, in which Andronicus participated, was discovered and he was thrown into prison.  There he remained for about twelve years, during which time he made repeated but unsuccessful attempts to escape.  At last, in [[1165]], he was successful; and, after passing through many dangers, reached the court of [[Yaroslav]], grand prince of [[Ruthenia]], at [[Kyiv]].  While under the protection of the grand prince, Andronicus brought about an alliance between him and the emperor Manuel, and so restored himself to the emperor's favour.  With a Russian army he joined Manuel in the invasion of [[Hungary]] and assisted at the siege of [[Semlin]].

After a successful campaign Manuel and Andronicus returned together to Constantinople ([[1168]]); but a year after, Andronicus refused to take the oath of allegiance to the prince of Hungary, whom Manuel desired to become his successor.  He was removed from court, but received the province of [[Cilicia]].  

Being still under the displeasure of the emperor, Andronicus fled to the court of [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond]], [[Principality of Antioch|prince of Antioch]].  While residing here he captivated and seduced the beautiful daughter of the prince, Philippa, sister of the empress [[Maria of Antioch|Maria]].  The anger of the emperor was again roused by this dishonour, and Andronicus was compelled to flee.  

He took refuge with [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]], whose favour he gained, and who invested him with the [[Principality of Galilee|Lordship of Beirut]].  In Jerusalem he saw [[Theodora Comnena|Theodora]], the beautiful widow of the late King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]] and niece of the emperor Manuel.  Although Andronicus was at that time fifty-six years old, age had not diminished his charms, and Theodora became the next victim of his artful seduction.  To avoid the vengeance of the Emperor, she fled with Andronicus to the court of the Sultan of [[Damascus]]; but not deeming themselves safe there, they continued their perilous journey through [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Turkestan]], round the [[Caspian Sea]] and across [[Mount Caucasus]], until at length they settled in the ancestral lands of the Comneni at [[Oinaion]],  on the shores of the [[Black Sea]], between [[Trebizond]] and [[Sinope]]. 

While Andronicus was on one of his incursions, his castle was surprised by the governor of Trebizond, and Theodora with her two children were captured and sent to Constantinople.  To obtain their release Andronicus made abject submission to the Emperor and, appearing in chains before him, implored pardon.  This he obtained, and was allowed to retire with Theodora into banishment at Oinaion.

In [[1180]] the emperor Manuel died, and was succeeded by his son [[Alexius II Comnenus]], who was under the guardianship of the empress Maria.  Her conduct excited popular indignation, and the consequent disorders, amounting almost to civil war, gave an opportunity to the ambition of Andronicus.  He left his retirement in [[1182]], secured the support of the army and marched upon Constantinople, where his advent was stained by a cruel massacre of the Latin inhabitants, which was focused on the [[Venice|Venetian]] merchants who virtually controlled the economy of the city.  Alexius was compelled to acknowledge him as colleague in the empire, but was soon put to death.  

Andronicus, now ([[1183]]) sole emperor, married [[Agnes of France]], widow of Alexius II and a child twelve years of age. Agnes was a daughter of [[Louis VII of France]] and his third wife [[Adèle of Champagne]]. 

His short reign was characterized by strong and wise measures.  He resolved to suppress many abuses, but, above all things, to check [[feudalism]] and limit the power of the nobles.  The people, who felt the severity of his laws, at the same time acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors.  The aristocrats, however, were infuriated against him, and summoned to their aid [[William II of Sicily]].  This prince landed in [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] with a strong force, and marched as far as [[Thessalonica]], which he took and destroyed; but he was shortly afterwards defeated, and compelled to return to [[Sicily]].

Andronicus seems then to have resolved to exterminate the aristocracy, and his plans were nearly crowned with success.  But in [[1185]], during his absence from the capital, his lieutenant ordered the arrest and execution of [[Isaac II Angelus|Isaac Angelus]], a descendant of the first Alexius.  Isaac escaped and took refuge in the church of [[Hagia Sophia]].  He appealed to the populace, and a tumult arose which spread rapidly over the whole city.  When Andronicus arrived he found that his power was overthrown, and that Isaac had been proclaimed emperor.  Isaac delivered him over to his enemies, and for three days he was exposed to their fury and resentment. His punishments included flogging, being tied to the back of a sick camel and having boiling water thrown in his face. At last they hung him up by the feet between two pillars.  His dying agonies were shortened by an [[Italy|Italian]] soldier, who mercifully plunged a sword into his body.  He died on [[September 12]], 1185.  Andronicus was the last of the [[Comnenus|Comneni]] to rule Constantinople, although his grandsons [[Alexius I of Trebizond]] and his brother [[David (co-emperorof Trebizond)|David]] founded the [[Empire of Trebizond]] in [[1204]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andronicus of Cyrrhus''' was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[astronomer]] who flourished about 100 BC.

He built a [[horologium]] at [[Athens]], the so-called [[Tower of the Winds]], a considerable portion of which still exists. It is octagonal, with figures carved on each side, representing the eight principal winds. In antiquity a bronze figure of [[Triton (god)|Triton]] on the summit, with a rod in his hand, turned round by the wind, pointed to the quarter from which it blew. From this model is derived the custom of placing weathercocks on steeples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andronicus of Rhodes''' (c. 70 B.C.), was the eleventh scholarch 
of the [[Peripatetics]].  His chief work was the arrangement of 
the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Theophrastus]] with materials 
supplied to him by [[Tyrannion]]. Before his time, Aristotle's dialogues were widely known, but his treatises had been lost in obscurity.  Besides arranging the works, 
he seems to have written paraphrases and commentaries, none 
of which is extant.  Two treatises are sometimes erroneously 
attributed to him, one on the Emotions, the other a commentary 
on Aristotle's Ethics (really by Constantine Palaeocappa 
in the 16th century, or by John Callistus of Thessalonica).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ammianus Marcellinus''' was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historian who wrote during [[Late Antiquity]].

He was born about [[325]]&amp;#8209;[[330]], probably at [[Antioch]] (the probability hinges on whether he was the recipient of a surviving letter to a Marcellinus from a fellow citizen of Antioch). The date of his death is unknown, but he must have lived till [[391]], as he mentions [[Aurelius Victor]] as the city [[prefect]] for that year. The surviving books of his valuable history cover the years [[353]]&amp;#8209;[[378]]; the work is sometimes referred to by a Latin title as ''Res Gestae'', a usage best avoided, however, since it leads to confusion with the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]''.

He was &quot;a [[soldier]] and a [[Greek people|Greek]]&quot; he tells us, and his enrollment among the elite ''protectores domestici'' (household guards) shows that he was of noble birth. He entered the army at an early age, when [[Constantius II]] was emperor of the East, and was sent to serve under [[Ursicinus]], governor of [[Nisibis]] in [[Roman Mesopotamia]], and ''magister militiae.''  

He returned to Italy with Ursicinus, when he was recalled by Constantius, and accompanied him on the expedition against [[Silvanus the Frank]], who had been forced by the unjust accusations of his enemies into proclaiming himself emperor in [[Gaul]]. With Ursicinus he went twice to the East, and barely escaped with his life from Amida or Amid (modern [[Diyarbakir]]), when it was taken by the Persian king [[Shapur II of Persia|Shapur II]].  When Ursicinus lost his office and the favour of Constantius, Ammianus seems to have shared his downfall; but under [[Julian the Apostate]], Constantius's successor, he regained his position. He accompanied this emperor, for whom he expresses enthusiastic admiration, in his campaigns against the [[Alamanni]] and the [[Sassanid dynasty|Persians]]; after his death he took part in the retreat of [[Jovian]] as far as Antioch, where he was residing when the conspiracy of [[Theodorus]] ([[371]]) was discovered and cruelly put down.  

Eventually he settled in Rome, where, at an advanced age, he wrote (in Latin) a history of the Roman empire from the accession of [[Nerva]] ([[96]]) to the death of [[Valens]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] ([[378]]), thus forming a continuation of the work of [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]]. This history (''Res Gestae Libri XXXI'') was originally in thirty-one books, but the first thirteen are lost. The surviving eighteen books cover the period from [[353]] to 378. As a whole it has been considered extremely valuable, being a clear, comprehensive and impartial account of events by a contemporary of soldierly honesty, independent judgement and wide reading. Recent studies have, however, shown the [[rhetoric]]al power in his histories. Like all ancient historians, he did not even attempt to produce a history in the modern style: he had a strong political and pagan religious agenda to pursue, and he contrasted Constantius II with Julian to the former's constant disadvantage.

[[Edward Gibbon]] judged Ammianus as &quot;an accurate and faithful guide, who composed the history of his own times without indulging the prejudices and passions which usually affect the mind of a contemporary.&quot; Ammianus was a [[paganism|pagan]], and when he marginalises [[Christianity]] repeatedly in his account, we are reminded that making Christianity the state religion did not make all Romans Christians. His style is generally harsh, often pompous and extremely obscure, occasionally even journalistic in tone, but the author's foreign origin and his military life and training partially explain this.  

Further, the work being intended for public recitation, some rhetorical embellishment was necessary, even at the cost of simplicity. It is a striking fact that Ammianus, though a professional soldier, gives excellent pictures of social and economic problems, and in his attitude to the non-Roman peoples of the empire he is far more broad-minded than writers like [[Livy]] and Tacitus; his digressions on the various countries he had visited are particularly interesting.  

In his description of the Empire &amp;mdash;the exhaustion produced by excessive taxation, the financial ruin of the middle classes, the progressive decline in the morale of the army&amp;mdash; we find the explanation of its fall before the [[Goths]] twenty years after his death.

==Quote==
Famous '''mis'''quote: &quot;''Houston, we have a problem''&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Actual quote: &quot;''Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here''&quot; [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Timeline/apollo13chron.html], uttered by Swigert to ground. Lovell then uttered this similar phrase: &quot;''Houston, we've had a problem.''&quot;

==Mission highlights==
The Apollo 13 mission began with a lesser known malfunction which could have been equally catastrophic. During second stage burn the center engine shut down prematurely. Engineers later discovered that this was due to dangerous [[pogo oscillation]]s which might have torn the second stage apart; the engine was experiencing 68g vibrations at 16 hertz, flexing the thrust frame by 3 inches. Luckily the oscillations caused a low pressure reading to register, and the computer shut the engine down automatically. This was later traced to amplification of the pogo that had occurred on previous flights by an unexpected interaction with the cavitation in the turbopumps. Later missions had anti-pogo devices as had already been planned since before Apollo 13 which solved the problem.

When Apollo 13 was 321,860 kilometers (199,990 mi) from Earth, an oxygen tank in the service module exploded. The only solution was for the crew to cancel their planned landing, swing around the Moon and return on a trajectory back to Earth. However, because their command/service module &quot;Odyssey&quot; was severely damaged,  the three astronauts had to use the lunar module &quot;Aquarius&quot; as a crowded lifeboat for the return home. The four-day return trip was cold, uncomfortable, and tense. But Apollo 13 proved the program's ability to weather a major crisis and bring the crew back home safely. 

===Problem=== 
As the [[spacecraft]] was on its way to the Moon, the number two oxygen tank in the [[Service Module]] (SM) exploded when [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Mission Control]] requested that the crew perform a &quot;cryo stir&quot;, in which the oxygen &quot;slush&quot; is stirred to prevent it from stratifying. Teflon insulation covering damaged electrical wires powering the stirrer motor caught fire when power was applied. The fire caused a pressure increase above the tank's nominal 1,000 lbf/in&amp;sup2; (7 MPa), and the tank exploded. This explosion damaged other parts of the service module, including the number 1 oxygen tank. At the time of the explosion, however, the true cause was not known; one  conjecture was a [[meteoroid]] impact. The loss of both oxygen tanks in the service module and thus the oxygen required to create electrical power for the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Modules]] (CSM) meant that the CSM had to be completely shut down. The [[Command Module]] (CM) contained batteries for use during re-entry, after the Service Module was jettisoned, but these would only last about ten hours, and needed to be saved for re-entry. The crew survived by using the [[Lunar Module]] (LM, still attached to the CM) as a &quot;lifeboat&quot;. 

[[Image:Apollo 13 SM.jpg|thumb|250px|Apollo 13 damaged Service Module (NASA)]]
The damage to the CSM meant that the Moon-landing mission (originally intended to land at the [[Fra Mauro formation|Fra Mauro]] Highlands) had to be aborted; a single pass around the Moon was made and the spacecraft returned to [[Earth]]. Considerable ingenuity under extreme pressure was required from both the crew and the [[flight controller]]s to figure out how to [[jury rig]] the craft for the crew's safe return, with much of the world watching the drama on television. One of the major stumbling blocks in this was that the LM &quot;lifeboat&quot; was equipped to sustain two people for two days, and it would now have to sustain three people for four days. One of the most critical problems was that the [[lithium hydroxide]] [[carbon dioxide]] filters in the LM would not last for all four days, and the CM's spare filters were the wrong shape for the LM's filter receptacle; an adapter had to be fabricated from materials in the spacecraft. 

To accomplish a safe return to Earth, a significant course correction to place the spacecraft on a [[free return trajectory]] was required. This would normally be a simple procedure using the [[service module]] [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] engine. However, the [[flight controller]]s did not know the extent of the damage the service module had suffered and did not want to risk firing the main engine. Instead, the course correction would have to be performed by firing the lunar module's descent engine. After extensive discussion, engineers on the ground found it was possible. The initial maneuver to change to a free return trajectory was made within hours of the accident.  The descent engine was fired again after passage around the Moon in order to accelerate the spacecraft's return to Earth, and later for a minor course correction.

As re-entry to Earth's atmosphere approached, NASA took the unusual step of jettisoning the Service Module first, while the Lunar Module was still attached to the Command Module.  The LM thrusters were used to maneuver the CM/LM stack to point its windows at the departing SM, and photos were taken.  When the crew saw the damaged service module, they reported that the access panel covering the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tanks and fuel cells had been blown off. 

There was some fear that the extensive condensation in the CM, due to reduced temperatures during the return leg, might have seriously damaged the electronics of the Command Module, which would become apparent upon activation.  But the equipment worked perfectly when activated, at least partly due to the extensive design modifications made to the CM after the [[Apollo 1]] fire.

[[Image:Apollo13 splashdown.jpg|left|thumb|160px|A successful splashdown (NASA)]]

The crew returned unharmed to Earth, although Haise had a [[urinary tract infection]] resulting from the scarcity of potable water on the damaged ship and the difficulty of disposing of urine, and had to be treated in an infirmary. 

While the crew was unfortunate to have this kind of major malfunction, they were still extremely lucky that it occurred on the first leg of the mission when they had a maximum of supplies, equipment, and power to use in the emergency. If the explosion had occurred while in orbit around the moon, or on the return leg after the LM had been jettisoned, the crew probably would not have survived.

After the completion of the mission, there was a full investigation of the incident and the craft was modified to prevent future occurrences of the fault.

[[Jim Lovell]] and [[Jeffrey Kluger|Jeffrey Kluger's]] book about the mission, ''[[Lost Moon]]'', was later turned into a successful movie, ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', starring [[Tom Hanks]], [[Bill Paxton]] and [[Kevin Bacon]] as the Apollo crewmen.

===Cause of the accident===
The explosion on Apollo 13 led to a lengthy investigation of the underlying cause.  Thanks to detailed manufacturing records and logs of mission problems, the failure of the faulty oxygen tank was 
tracked to multiple faults that were not problems individually, but nearly led to disaster on this mission.

Liquid gases are very difficult to handle, and most storage containers holding them are unsealed so that pressure from expanding gas will not cause the container to fail (much like freezing water in even the strongest sealed container will shatter it).  Apollo's liquid oxygen tank was a marvel of [[engineering]], able to hold several hundred pounds of highly pressurized liquid gas to supply the craft with oxygen, fuel for [[electricity]] (along with hydrogen) and [[water]] from the by-product of the [[fuel cells]].  Left alone, the tank was capable of safely holding liquid oxygen under high pressure for years before it evaporated because of its design and insulation.  Unfortunately, the very characteristic that made the tank useful made internal inspection impossible.

The tank was made of several basic components that were relevant to the accident:
* A [[thermostat]] to control the heater within the tank that sped the evaporation of the liquid into gaseous oxygen;
* A [[thermometer]] to determine the temperature of the heater;
* Valves and piping that were designed to allow the tank to be completely emptied of liquid by forcing gas into the tank; 
* An interior coating of [[teflon]] that protected the wiring from the extremely cold gas; and
* An internal fan to stir the liquid oxygen (liquid oxygen will turn into a &quot;slush&quot; at these pressures if it is allowed to sit for a long period of time).

These were the basic design, manufacturing and operational problems that led to the accident.
* The thermostat was originally designed to handle the 28 [[volt]] supply that would be used in the command module.  However, the specification for the tank was changed so that it had to handle 65 [[volt]]s on the launch pad.  Most of the wiring was changed to handle the higher voltage, but the thermostat was not.
* The thermometer was designed to read out at the highest operational temperature of the heater, about 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  Higher temperatures registered at 100 °F, but the thermostat was supposed to cut out at 80 °F (27 °C), making higher temperatures impossible.
* During assembly, the structure carrying the tank that failed was dropped about 2 inches (5 cm).  The exterior was undamaged, but the pipes that directed flow within the tank became misaligned. 
* For ground testing the tank was filled.  However, when it came time to empty it, the problem with the piping was discovered.  As such, the tank could not be properly emptied except by running the heater to evaporate the liquid gas. Not using this tank would have delayed the mission and there was no alternative tank available.  Lovell was aware of the decision to use the heater to evaporate the oxygen, which was calculated to take a few days at the highest operational temperature of 80 °F (27 °C).
* However, when the heater was turned on continuously, the higher voltage fused the thermostat, which allowed the heater to keep heating up.  Because the thermometer did not register temperatures higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), the monitoring equipment did not pick this up.  The current recorder in the power supply showed that the heater was not cycling on and off, but no-one noticed it at the time.  Instead of taking several days, the gas evaporated in hours, and the interior of the tank kept heating up, reaching an estimated 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 °C).  This burned off the teflon coating, leaving the wires inside the tank exposed.
* The rest was inevitable.  When the tank was refilled with oxygen, it became a bomb waiting to go off.  The order to run the &quot;cryo stir&quot; to run the fans set off sparks inside the tank which led to the explosion.
* Disaster might have been averted, had not the oxygen tanks been adjacent. Although the second tank survived the explosion, its valves were damaged which allowed the oxygen within to leak out.  In future Apollo missions, the two oxygen tanks were separately located.

==Mission notes==
*There was no time to properly replace the original [[lunar plaques|lunar plaque]] on ''Aquarius'' (which bore Mattingly's name), so Jim Lovell was given a replacement (with Swigert's name) to place over the original plaque once they landed on the moon.  However, because the lunar landing was never made, Lovell kept the plaque, which is one of the few mementos from the mission that he has on display at his home.

*As a result of following the free return trajectory, the altitude of Apollo 13 over the [[Far side (Moon)|lunar far side]] was approximately 100 km greater than the corresponding orbital altitude on the remaining Apollo lunar missions. This could mean an all-time [[altitude]] record for human spaceflight&amp;mdash;not even superseded [[as of 2006]]&amp;mdash;but this may well not be the case: the variation in distance between Earth and the Moon owing to the [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] of the Moon's orbit about Earth is much larger than this 100 km.  The [[Guinness Book of Records]] listed this flight as having the absolute altitude record for a manned spacecraft, and Lovell should have received a certificate from them attesting to this record (Lovell stated in the book ''Lost Moon'' that apart from the plaque and a couple of other pieces of salvage, the only other item he has regarding this mission was a letter from [[Charles Lindbergh]]).

*The splashdown point was {{coor dm|21|38|S|165|22|W|}}, SE of American Samoa and 6.5 km (4 mi) from the recovery ship, [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']].

*Superstitious people have associated the [[Triskaidekaphobia|belief that 13 is an unlucky number]] to the mission, especially due to the fact that the mission began at 13:13 [[Central Standard Time Zone|CST]], the problems began on [[April 13]], and the mission is called Apollo 13.

==Insignia==
The Apollo 13 logo featured three flying horses, and the motto ''Ex luna, scientia'' (from the Moon, knowledge), and the number of the mission in Roman numerals.  It is one of two Apollo insignias (the other being ''[[Apollo 11]]'''s) not to include the names of the crew (which was fortunate, considering one of the original crew was replaced not long before the mission began).

==Relics==
The command module is currently displayed at the [[Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center]], [[Hutchinson, Kansas]]. It was formerly at the [[Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace]], [[Paris]]. The lunar module burned up in Earth's atmosphere [[17 April]], [[1970]], having been targeted to enter over the Pacific Ocean to reduce the possibility of contamination from a [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG) on board (had the mission proceeded as planned, the RTG would have been used to power the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package]], and then remained on the Moon). The RTG survived reentry (as designed) and landed in the [[Tonga Trench]]. While it will remain radioactive for approximately 2000 years, it does not appear to be releasing radioactive material.

==Dramatization==
* ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' - the 1995 [[film]] directed by [[Ron Howard (American director)|Ron Howard]] and starring, as the astronauts, [[Tom Hanks]], [[Bill Paxton]], and [[Kevin Bacon]], with [[Ed Harris]] as [[flight director]] [[Gene Kranz]], [[Kathleen Quinlan]], and [[Gary Sinise]] in supporting roles.  The film was based on ''Lost Moon'', Jim Lovell's book about the incident.
* In the [[1993]] film ''[[Falling Down]]'', [[Michael Douglas]]' character compares himself to the crew of Apollo 13, claiming that he had passed the &quot;point of no return&quot; as they had, thus causing them to circle the moon.

==Games==
* ''[[Apollo 13 Solarquest]]'' was a [[1995]] board game released by Universal Games. It was based on the popular [[1986]] &quot;space-age&quot; [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] variant, [[Solarquest]].

==Mission Highlights==
Apollo 7 was a confidence-builder. After the January 1967 [[Apollo 1|Apollo launch pad fire]], the Apollo command module had been extensively redesigned. Schirra, who would be the only astronaut to fly [[Mercury program|Mercury]], [[Gemini program|Gemini]] and Apollo missions, commanded this Earth-orbital shakedown of the command and service modules. Since it was not carrying a [[lunar module]], Apollo 7 could be launched with the [[Saturn IB]] booster rather than the much larger and more powerful [[Saturn V]]. 

The Apollo hardware and all mission operations worked without any significant problems, and the Service Propulsion System (SPS), the all-important engine that would place Apollo in and out of lunar orbit, made eight nearly perfect firings. Even though Apollo's larger cabin was more comfortable than Gemini's, eleven days in orbit took its toll on the astronauts. The food was bad, and all three developed colds. As a result Schirra became irritable with requests from Mission Control and all three began &quot;talking back&quot; to the [[capsule communicator|Capcom]] leading to none of the crew being selected for further missions. But the mission successfully proved the spaceworthiness of the basic Apollo vehicle. 

Goals for the mission included the first live [[television]] broadcast from an American spacecraft ([[Gordon Cooper]] had broadcast slow scan television pictures from [[Mercury 9|Faith 7]] in 1963) and testing the [[lunar module]] docking maneuver. 

First orbit: [[Perigee]] 231 km, [[Apogee]] 297 km, Period 89.78 min, Inclination 31.63 deg. Weight: C/SM 14,781 kg. 

The splashdown point was 27 deg 32 min N, 64 deg 04 min W, 200 nautical miles (370 km) SSW of Bermuda and 13 km (8 mi) north of the recovery ship [[USS Essex (CV-9) | USS Essex]].  

For nearly 30 years the Apollo 7 module was on loan (renewable every two years) to the National Museum of Science and Technology of Canada, in [[Ottawa]], along with the space suit worn by [[Wally Schirra]].  In November 2003 the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. requested them back for display at their new annex at the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]].

The Apollo 7 Capsule is currently on display at the Frontiers of Flight Museum located next to Love Field in Dallas Texas.  The spacecraft is on loan from the Smithsonian.

Apollo 7 was the only manned Apollo launch to take place from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Launch Complex 34, as all subsequent Apollo (including Apollo-Soyuz) and Skylab missions were launched from [[Launch Complex 39]] at the nearby [[Kennedy Space Center]].

==Original mission profile==
In October 1967, it was planned that following the first manned orbital flight of the CSM ([[Apollo 7]], also known as the C Mission), the second manned Apollo mission (D Mission) would have a manned CSM launched on a Saturn 1B, and a few days later the Lunar Module launched on a second Saturn 1B to practise the first orbit rendezvous. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart were given this mission, with [[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]] and [[William Anders]] being assigned to a later, similar Earth-orbit test (E Mission), this time using the [[Saturn V]] to carry both the CSM and LM. 

However, production problems with the LM meant that the D Mission would not be able to fly until the spring of [[1969]], so NASA officials created another &quot;C-Prime&quot; mission to go inbetween the C and D missions, involving the CSM (with no LM) making the first manned flight to the Moon. This flight became [[Apollo 8]], and was given to Borman, Lovell and Anders. Although he was in the rotation for it, McDivitt claims he was never offered the &quot;C-Prime&quot; mission as he was already experienced with the LM - but if he had been offered it, he probably would have declined, as he wanted to fly the LM. The original E Mission was subsequently scrubbed - Apollo 9 was the only Earth-orbit test of the full Apollo spacecraft, and was launched on a Saturn V instead of two Saturn 1Bs. This had long lasting consequence - when the crew rotation for Apollos 8 and 9 were swapped, their backup crews were also swapped, putting [[Neil Armstrong]] and his crew (who were Borman, Lovell and Anders' backups) in line for the first manned landing mission instead of [[Pete Conrad]] and his crew.

==Mission highlights==
Apollo 9 was the first space test of the complete Apollo spacecraft, including the third critical piece of Apollo hardware - the [[lunar module]]. For ten days, the astronauts put all three Apollo vehicles through their paces in Earth orbit, undocking and then redocking the lunar lander with the command module, just as they would in lunar orbit. Apollo 9 gave proof that the Apollo machines were up to the task of orbital rendezvous and docking. 

For this and all subsequent Apollo flights, the crews were allowed to name their own spacecraft. The gangly lunar module was named &quot;Spider,&quot; and the command module was labelled &quot;Gumdrop&quot; on account of the blue cellophane wrapping in which the craft arrived at KSC. 

Schweickart and Scott performed an EVA - Schweickart checked out the new Apollo spacesuit, the first to have its own life support system rather than being dependent on an umbilical connection to the spacecraft, while Scott filmed him from the command module hatch. Schweickart was due to carry out a more extensive set of activity to test the suit, and demonstrate that it was possible for astronauts to perform an EVA from the lunar module to the command module in an emergency, but as he had been suffering from [[space sickness]], this was restricted to the stand up test in the Lunar Module hatch. 

McDivitt and Schweickart later testflew the LM, and practiced separation and docking maneuvers in earth orbit. They flew the LM up to 111 miles from &quot;Gumdrop&quot;, using the engine on the descent stage to propel them originally, before jettisoning it and using the ascent stage to return.

The splashdown point was 23 deg 15 min N, 67 deg 56 min W, 180 miles (290 km) east of Bahamas and within sight of the recovery ship [[USS Guadalcanal (LPH-7)|USS ''Guadalcanal'']]. 

The command module was displayed at the [[Michigan Space and Science Center]], [[Jackson, Michigan]] until April 2004 when the center closed. In May, 2004, the command module '''Gumdrop''' was moved to San Diego Aerospace Museum in southern California. The LM ascent stage orbit decayed on [[23 October]] [[1981]], the LM descent stage (1969-018D) orbit decayed [[22 March]] [[1969]]. The S-IVB stage J-2 engine was restarted after Lunar Module extraction and propelled the stage into solar orbit by burning to depletion.

'''Arthritis''' (from Greek ''arthro-'', joint + ''-itis'', inflammation) is a group of conditions that affect the health of the [[bone]] [[joint]]s in the body. One in three adult Americans suffer from some form of arthritis and the disease affects about twice as many women as men.

Arthritic [[disease]]s include [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[psoriatic arthritis]], which are [[autoimmune disorder|autoimmune diseases]]; [[septic arthritis]], caused by joint infection; and the more common [[osteoarthritis]], or degenerative joint disease.  Arthritis can be caused from strains and injuries caused by repetitive motion, sports, overexertion, and falls. Unlike the autoimmune diseases, osteoarthritis largely affects older people and results from the degeneration of joint cartilage. Other forms are discussed below.

Arthritic joints can be sensitive to weather changes. The increased sensitivity is thought to be caused by the affected joints developing extra nerve endings in an attempt to protect the joint from further damage.

==Signs and symptoms==
All arthritides feature [[pain]], which is generally worse in the morning and on initiating movement, and resolves in the course of time. In elderly people and children, the pain may not be the main feature, and the patient simply moves less (elderly) or refuse to use the affected limb (children).

When faced with joint pain, a doctor will generally ask about several other medical symptoms (such as [[fever]], skin symptoms, breathlessness, [[Raynaud's phenomenon]]) that may narrow down the [[differential diagnosis]] to a few items, for which testing can be done.

Arthritis and fever together are pointers towards ''septic arthritis'' (see below). This is a [[medical emergency]], and requires urgent referral to a [[rheumatology|rheumatologist]].

==Diagnosis==
The various types of arthritis can be distinguished by the pace of onset, the age and sex of the patient, the amount of (and which) joints affected, additional symptoms such as [[psoriasis]], [[iridocyclitis]], [[Raynaud's phenomenon]], and rheumatoid nodules, and other clues.

[[Blood test]]s and [[X-ray]]s of the affected joints are often performed to make the diagnosis. X-rays can show erosions or bone appositions.

Screening blood tests: [[full blood count]], [[electrolytes]], [[renal function]], [[liver enzyme]]s, [[calcium]], [[phosphate]], [[protein electrophoresis]], [[C-reactive protein]] and the [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR). Specific tests are the [[rheumatoid factor]], [[antinuclear factor]] (ANF), [[extractable nuclear antigen]] and specific antibodies whenever the ANF is found to be positive.

==Treatment==
Treatment options vary depending on the precise condition, but include [[surgery]], and drug treatment, reduction of joint stress, [[Physical therapy|physical]] and [[Occupational therapy|occupational therapy]], and [[pain management]]. There are also numerous herbal remedies that purportedly treat arthritis, including ''[[Harpagophytum procumbens]]''. For specifics, see the articles on the individual conditions listed below.

In March 2005, researchers at [[Harvard Medical School]] and [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] in the USA found that a diet rich in [[oily fish]] raised the body's production of an anti-inflammatory fat, and may thus reduce the effects of arthritis. According to their study published in the [[Journal of Experimental Medicine]], this diet worked best when combined with low [[aspirin]] doses.

==Types of arthritis==
Primary forms of arthritis:
* [[Septic arthritis]]
* [[Rheumatoid arthritis]]
* [[Osteoarthritis]]
* [[Gout]] and [[pseudogout]]
* [[Juvenile arthritis]]
* [[Still's disease]]
* [[Ankylosing spondylitis]]

Secondary to other diseases:
* [[Lupus erythematosus|Systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE)
* [[Henoch-Schönlein purpura]]
* [[Psoriatic arthritis]]
* [[Reiter's syndrome]]
* [[Reactive arthritis]]
* [[Hemochromatosis]]
* [[Hepatitis]]
* [[Wegener's granulomatosis]] (and many other [[vasculitis]] syndromes)
* [[Familial Mediterranean fever]] (FMF), [[Hyperimmunoglobinemia D with recurrent fever|HIDS]] (hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome) and [[TRAPS]] ([[TNF-alpha]] receptor associated periodic fever syndrome).

Diseases that can mimic arthritis:
* [[Pierre Marie-Bamberger syndrome]] (hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, a [[paraneoplastic phenomenon]] of [[lung cancer]])
* [[multiple myeloma]]
* [[osteoporosis]]
* ''others''

==History==
While evidence of primary ankle osteoarthritis has been discovered in dinosaurs, the first known traces of human arthritis date back as far as [[4500 BC]]. It was noted in skeletal remains of [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] found in [[Tennessee]] and parts of what is now Olathe, Kansas.  Evidence of arthritis has been found throughout history from Otzi, the name of a mummy (circa 3000 BC) found along the border of modern Italy and Austria, to the Egyptian mummies circ 2590 BC.  Around 500 BC willow bark gained popularity when it was discovered that this bark could help relieve some of the aches and pains of arthritis.  It wasn't until over 2000 years later in the early 1820s that European scientists began to scientifically study what the chemical compound was in willow bark that alleviated the arthritis symptoms.  They discovered the compound was salicin.  When they isolated salicin, however, they found it was very noxious to the stomach.  Almost 80 years later, in 1897, an employee of Bayer Company -- then a dye production company -- named Felix Hoffman discovered how to isolate the compound and make it less irritating to the stomach.  Hoffman was attempting to make the drug in order to help his father who was suffering with arthritis.  In 1899, Bayer Company trademarked Hoffman's discovery under the name &quot;Aspirin.&quot;  Today it is believed that over a trillion tablets of aspirin have been sold worldwide.

The [[chemical compound]] and [[alkyne|unsaturated]] [[hydrocarbon]]  '''acetylene''', also known under [[IUPAC nomenclature]] (see [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry]]) as '''ethyne''', was discovered in 1836 by [[Edmund Davy]], in [[England]].

==Preparation==
The principal raw materials for acetylene manufacture are [[calcium carbonate]] ([[limestone]]) and [[coal]]. The calcium carbonate is first converted into calcium oxide and the coal into [[coke (fuel)|coke]], then the two are reacted with each other to form [[calcium carbide]] and [[carbon monoxide]]:

:CaO + 3C &amp;rarr; CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO

Calcium carbide (or calcium acetylide) and water are then reacted by any of several methods to produce acetylene and [[calcium hydroxide]].

:CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Acetylene can also be manufactured by the partial [[combustion]] of [[methane]] with [[oxygen]], or by the [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of [[hydrocarbon|hydrocarbons]].

==Safety and handling==

===Compression===

Acetylene can explode with extreme violence if the pressure of the gas exceeds about 100 kPa as a gas or when in liquid or solid form, so it is shipped and stored dissolved in [[acetone]]. The majority of acetylene's chemical energy is contained in the carbon-carbon triple bond.

===Toxic effects===

Inhaling acetylene may cause dizziness, headache and nausea&lt;ref name=&quot;HitCL&quot;&gt;Muir, GD (ed.) 1971, ''Hazards in the Chemical Laboratory'', The Royal Institute of Chemistry, London.&lt;/ref&gt;. It may also contain toxic impurities: the [http://www.cganet.com/publication_detail.asp?id=G-1.1 Compressed Gas Association Commodity Specification for acetylene] has established a grading system for identifying and quantifying [[phosphine]], [[arsine]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]] content in commercial grades of acetylene in order to limit exposure to these impurities.

===Fire hazard===

Mixtures with air containing between 3% and 82% acetylene are explosive on ignition. The minimum ignition temperature is 335°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;HitCL&quot; /&gt;

==Reactions==
Above 400 °C (which is quite low for a hydrocarbon), the [[pyrolysis]] of acetylene will start. The main products are the [[dimer]] [[vinylacetylene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[benzene]]. At  temperatures above 900 °C, the main product will be [[soot]].

Polymerization with [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]s produces [[polyacetylene]] films.

==Uses==
Approximately 80 percent of the acetylene produced annually in the [[United States]] is used in chemical synthesis. The remaining 20 percent is used primarily for [[oxyacetylene]] [[gas welding]] and [[blowtorch|cutting]]. Combustion with oxygen produces a flame of over 3300°C, releasing 11,800 [[Joule|J]]/g.

Acetylene is also used in the [[carbide lamp|acetylene ('carbide') lamp]], formerly found in mines (not to be confused with the [[Davy lamp]]), and on vintage [[automobile|cars]]; it is still sometimes used by [[spelunker]]s. In this context, the acetylene is generated by adding [[calcium carbide]] (CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) pellets to [[water]].

In former times a few towns used acetylene for lighting, including [[Tata_(Hungary)|Tata]] in [[Hungary]] where it was installed on [[24 July]] [[1897]], and [[North Petherton]], [[England]] in 1898.

Nowadays acetylene is used for [[carburization]] (that is, [[carburization|hardening]]) of [[steel]]. Research in the last ten years has concluded that acetylene is the best hydrocarbon available for this purpose.

Acetylene has been proposed as a carbon feedstock for [[Molecular Manufacturing]] using Nanotechnology. Since it does not occur naturally, using acetylene could limit out-of-control self-replication.

==Other meanings==
Sometimes the plural &quot;acetylenes&quot; is used to more generally mean organic chemical compounds that contain the -C&lt;u&gt;=&lt;/u&gt;C= group: see [[-yne]].

{{WivesMuhammad}}
'''Aisha''', '''Ayesha''', ''''A'isha''', or ''''Aisha''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic ]]عائشة ''`ā'isha'', &quot;she who lives&quot;) was a wife of [[Muhammad]], whom Muslims regard as the final prophet of [[Islam]].

== Early life ==
It is not clear when Aisha was born. Most scholars calculate her age by reference to the date of her marriage to Muhammad ([[622]]) and then subtracting her age at marriage. However, there are many theories as to [[Aisha#Young marriage age controversy|her age at marriage]].

Aisha was the daughter of [[Abu Bakr]] of [[Mecca]]. They belonged to the [[Bani Tamim]] clan of the tribe of the [[Quraysh]], the tribe to which Muhammad also belonged. Aisha is said to have followed her father in accepting Islam when she was still young. She also joined him in his migration to [[Ethiopia]] in [[615]] CE; a number of Mecca's Muslims emigrated then, seeking refuge from persecution by the Meccans who still followed their pre-Islamic religions. 

According to the early Islamic historian [[al-Tabari]], Aisha's father tried to spare her the dangers and discomfort of the journey by solemnizing her marriage to her fiance, Jubair, son of Mut`am ibn `Adi. However, Mut’am refused to honor the long-standing betrothal, as he did not wish his family to be connected to the Muslim outcasts. The emigration to Ethiopia proved temporary and Abu Bakr's family returned to Mecca within a few years. Aisha was then betrothed to Muhammad.

== Aisha's marriage to Muhammad ==
The marriage was delayed until after the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]], or migration to [[Medina]], in 622. Aisha and her older sister [[Asma]] only moved to Medina after Muhammad had already fled there. Abu Bakr gave Muhammad the money to build a house for himself. After this, the wedding was celebrated very simply, by the bride and groom drinking a bowl of milk in front of witnesses. 

=== Status as &quot;favorite wife&quot; ===
Even though the marriage may have been politically motivated, to mark the ties between Muhammad and his companion Abu Bakr, most early accounts say that Muhammad and Aisha became sincerely fond of each other. Aisha is usually described as Muhammad's favorite wife. [[Shi'a]] Muslims would disagree with this description, regarding it as politically motivated. They adduce the following episodes as proof that Muhammad and Aisha's marriage did not always go smoothly. 

==== Aisha accused of adultery ====
Aisha was traveling with her husband Muhammad and some of his followers. She left camp in the morning to search for her lost necklace; when she returned, she found that the company had broken camp and left without her. She waited patiently for half a day, until she was rescued by a man named Safwan and taken to rejoin the caravan. 

Malicious tongues started to wag, claiming that she must have been having an affair with Safwan. Some urged Muhammad to divorce his wife. He then received a revelation directing that adultery be proven by four eyewitnesses, rather than simply inferred from opportunity.  One passage of the Qur'an, &quot;Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you...&quot; (Qur'an 24.11), is usually taken as a rebuke to those who slandered Aisha.

====The story of the honey====
According to one widely-accepted tale, Muhammad's wife Zainab bint Jahsh was given a skin filled with honey, which she shared with her husband. He was fond of sweets and stayed overlong with Zainab bint Jash; at least in the opinion of Aisha and her co-wife [[Hafsa]]. Aisha and Hafsa conspired. Each of them was to tell Muhammad that the honey had given him bad breath. When he heard this from two wives, he believed that it was true and swore that he would eat no more of the honey. Soon afterwards, he reported that he had received a revelation, in which he was told that he could eat anything permitted by God (Qur'an 66:1).  In the following verses, Muhammad's wives are rebuked for their unruliness: &quot;your hearts are inclined (to oppose him)&quot;.

Word spread in the small Muslim community that Muhammad's wives were tyrannizing over the mild-mannered man, speaking sharply to him and conspiring against him. Umar, Hafsa's father, scolded his daughter and also spoke to Muhammad of the matter. Muhammad, saddened and upset, separated from his wives for a month, sleeping by himself on a lumpy mattress. By the end of this time, his wives were humbled and harmony, of a sort, was restored.

When Muslim commentators on the [[Qur'an]] explicate [[Surah]] 66, it is usually this story that is told to explain the &quot;occasion of revelation&quot;. 

There is a similar but alternative explanation of [[At-Tahrim|Surah 66]], also involving Aisha. In this story, Aisha and her co-wives were unhappy because Muhammad was infatuated with [[Maria al-Qibtiyya]], the Christian Coptic woman who bore Muhammad a brief-lived son. (Some accounts say that she was a slave, some that she converted to Islam, was freed, and was taken as a wife.)

==== The death of Muhammad ====
Ibn Ishaq, in his ''Sirat Rasulallah'', states that during Muhammad's last illness, he sought Aisha's apartments and died with his head in her lap. The Sunni take this as evidence of Muhammad's fondness for Aisha. 

Aisha never remarried after Muhammad's death. A passage in the Qur'an forbids any Muslim to marry the prophet's widows. 

: ''Nor is it right for you that ye should annoy God's Apostle, or that ye should marry his widows after him at any time. Truly such a thing is in God's sight an enormity.'' (Al-Ahzab 33: 53)

==After Muhammad ==
=== Aisha's father becomes the first caliph ===
After Muhammad's death in 632 C.E., Aisha's father Abu Bakr became the first [[caliph]], or leader of the Muslims. This matter is extremely controversial. Shi'a believe that Ali should have been chosen to lead; Sunni maintain that the community chose Abu Bakr, and did so in accordance with Muhammad's wishes. This is discussed in much greater detail in the article [[Succession to Muhammad]].

===The battle of the camel===
Abu Bakr's reign was short, and in 634 C.E. he was succeeded by [[Umar ibn al-Khattab|Umar]], as caliph. Umar reigned 10 years, and was then  followed by [[Uthman ibn Affan|Uthman]] in 644 C.E. Both of these men had been among Muhammad's earliest followers, were linked to him by clanship and marriage, and had taken prominent parts in various military campaigns. 

Aisha, in the meantime, lived in Medina and made several pilgrimages to Mecca.  
In 656 C.E. Uthman was killed by rebellious Muslim soldiers. The rebels then asked Ali to be the new caliph. Many reports absolve Ali of complicity in the murder. He is reported to have refused the caliphate, saying, &quot;You are not a people fit for my rulership nor am I a master fit for you people&quot;. He agreed to rule only after his followers persisted. 

Aisha raised a small army which confronted [[Ali]]'s army outside the city of [[Basra]]. Battle ensued and Aisha's forces were defeated. Aisha was directing her forces from a howdah on the back of a camel; this [[656]] battle is therefore called the [[Battle of the Camel]]. 

Ali captured Aisha but declined to harm her. He sent her back to Medina under military escort. She lived a retired life until she died in approximately [[678]].

== Young marriage age controversy ==
The age of Aisha at marriage is an extremely contentious issue. On the one hand, there are several [[hadith]]s (said to have been narrated by Aisha herself) which state she was six or seven years old when betrothed and nine when the marriage was consummated.  On the other hand, calculations based on information found in an early Muslim chronicler, [[Ibn Ishaq]], indicate that Aisha was at least fourteen to sixteen years old, thus past the age of [[puberty]]. Other [[hadith]]s suggest that Aisha may have been nineteen or twenty years old when she married. 

Many Muslim scholars have accepted the tradition that Aisha was nine years old when the marriage was consummated. This has in turn led critics to denounce Muhammad for having sexual relations with a girl so young, which in modern times would be classified as [[child sexual abuse]]. Some respond to this criticism by claiming that Aisha was post-pubescent at nine and that early [[marriageable age|marriages]] were common in most cultures until fairly recent times. 

However, other Muslim scholars point to other traditions that conflict with those attributed to Aisha in this matter. If the other traditions are right, this would imply that Aisha was either confused in her dating, was exaggerating her youth at marriage, or that her stories (which were not written down until more than 100 years after her death) had been garbled in transmission.  If we believe traditions that say she was post-pubescent when married, then these other traditions, from [[Ibn Ishaq]] and [[Tabari]] and others, seem much more convincing.  

From the viewpoint of the Islamic clergy, the [[ulema]], this explanation, while relieving them of one difficulty, poses another. The &quot;late marriage&quot; argument values the biographical and historical literature, the [[sira]], over the canonical [[hadith]], or oral traditions accepted by the ulema. However, anything that threatens the value of the hadith, and especially hadith narrated by Aisha, threatens the whole elaborate structure of Islamic law, or [[sharia]].  The [[Shi'a]] version of shari'a is less at risk in this one instance, as the Shi'a deprecate anything sourced to Aisha.

Liberal Muslims do not see any problem with saving Muhammad's character at the expense of shari'a. Conservative Muslims, and the ulema, tend to embrace the &quot;early puberty&quot; theories.

=== Evidence that Aisha was nine when the marriage was consummated === 
These traditions are from the hadith collections of [[Bukhari]] (d. [[870]]) and [[Muslim b. al-Hajjaj]] (d. [[875]]).  These two collections are in general regarded as the most authentic by [[Sunni]] Muslims. 

* Sahih Muslim Book 008, Number 3310: 'Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house when I was nine years old. 

* Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 88 Narrated 'Urwa: The Prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with 'Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).

* Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64 Narrated 'Aisha: that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).  

* Sahih Bukhari 8:151, Narrated 'Aisha: &quot;I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet , and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Apostle used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fateh-al-Bari page 143, Vol.13) 

* Sahih Bukhari vol. 5, Book 58, Number 234  Narrated 'Aisha:  The prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six. We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Harith Kharzraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends.  She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became all right, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, &quot;Best wishes and Allah's blessing and a good luck.&quot; Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage).

Other hadith in Bukhari repeat this information.

History from [[Tabari]], volume 9, page 131

* &quot;Then the men and women got up and left.  The Messenger of God consummated his marriage with me in my house when I was nine years old.  Neither a camel nor a sheep was slaughtered on behalf of me&quot;......(The Prophet) married her three years before the Emigration, when she was seven years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine years old, after he had emigrated to Medina in Shawwal.  She was eighteen years old when he died.

=== Evidence that Aisha was older than nine ===
* According to [[Ibn Hisham]]'s recension of [[Ibn Ishaq]]'s (d. [[768]]) biography of Prophet Muhammad, the ''Sirat Rashul Allah'', the earliest surviving biography of Muhammad, Aisha accepted Islam before [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]]. If true, then Aisha accepted Islam during the first few years of Islam. She could not have been less than 14 years in 1 AH - the time she got married (Al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah, Ibn Hisham, Vol 1, Pg 227 - 234, Arabic, Maktabah al-Riyadh al-hadithah, Al-Riyadh).

* [[Tabari]] reports that when Abu Bakr planned on migrating to [[Ethiopia]] (8 years before [[Hijrah]]), he went to Mut`am - with whose son Aisha was engaged at that time - and asked him to take Aisha as his son's wife. Mut`am refused because Abu Bakr had converted to Islam. If Aisha was only six years old at the time of her betrothal to Muhammad, she could not have been born at the time Abu Bakr decided on migrating to [[Ethiopia]].  ''Tehqiq e umar e Siddiqah e Ka'inat, Habib ur Rahman Kandhalwi'', p. 38.

* Tabari in his treatise on Islamic history reports that Abu Bakr had four children and all four were born during the [[Jahiliyyah]] - the pre Islamic period. If Aisha was born in the period of jahiliyyah, she could not have been less than 14 years in 1 AH. ''Tarikh al-umam wa al-mamloo'k'', Al-Tabari, Vol. 4, p. 50.

* According to Ibn Hajar, [[Fatima Zahra|Fatima]] was five years older than Aisha. Fatima is reported to have been born when Muhammad was 35 years old. Muhammad migrated to Medina when he was 52, making Aisha 14 years old in 1 AH. ''Tamyeez al-Sahaabah'', Ibn Hajar al-Asqalaniy'', Vol. 4, p. 377.

* According to Abd ar Rahman ibn Abi Zannad, Aisha was 10 years younger than her sister Asma. (Siyar a´lâm an-nubalâ', adh-Dhahabî, Vol. 2, p. 289, Mu'assat ar-Risâla, Beirut, 1992). That is also confirmed by Ibn Kathir (al-Bidâya wa-n-nihâya, Ibn Kathîr, Bd. 8, S. 371, Dâr al-Fikr al-´Arabî, al-Dschîza, 1933). Virtually all other historical reports also agree in this matter. Ibn Kathir also reports that Asma was present when her son died in 73 AH and she herself died 5 days thereafter (other reports differ slightly, giving between 5 and 100 days between the deaths of the two). At the time of her death she was 100 years old (al-Bidâya wa-n-nihâya, Ibn Kathîr, Vol. 8, p. 372, Dâr al-Fikr al-´Arabî, al-Dschîza, 1933). This is also confirmed by Ibn Hadschar al-´Asqalânî who reports that she died in 73 or 74 AH at the age of 100 years. (Taqrîb at-tahdhîb, Ibn Hadschar al-´Asqalânî, p. 654, Bâb fi-n-nisâ', harfu l-alif, Lucknow). But this means, of course, that Asma was 27 or 28 years old at 1 AH and the 10 years youger Aisha already 17 or 18, so when Muhammad and Aisha started to live together she was already 19 or 20.

* Aisha has become known for having at the side of Muhammad in the battle of Badr (see for example hadiths by Muslim) as well as in the battle of Uhud (see e.g. hadiths by Bukhari). Bukhari also reports (Kitâb al-maghâzî, Bâb Ghazawat al-Khandaq wa-hiya l-Ahzâb) that the Prophet did not allow 14 year olds to participate but allowed them to join on their 15th birthday. This implies that Aisha was older at that time of these battles. However, it's also possible that the age restriction was not applied to Aisha as a wife of Muhammad.   

* In a hadith of Bukhari, Aisha says: &quot;I was a young girl (dschâriya) when Surah al-Qamar was revealed (Sahîh al-Bukhârî, Kitâb at-tafsîr, Bâb qaulihî Ta´âlâ &quot;Bali-s-sâ´atu mau´iduhum wa-s-sâ´atu ad-hâ wa-amarr&quot;). That Surah was revealed 8 years before Hijra and at that time Aisha would have been at most a baby (sabiyya) had she been only 9 years old at the age of her marriage. The word dschariya is most fitting for a 6-13 year old which would mean her age of marriage would be anywhere between 14 and 21. However, the exact dates of when al-Qamar was revealed is disputed. Thus, making this a weak argument. 

* Most Muslims generally agree that Aisha had reached the age of puberty at her marriage. This would be unlikely for a 9 year old. In addition, Aisha was already termed 'bikr', meaning virgin adult woman even when the marriage was discussed, i.e. 3 years before the actual marriage. (Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Vol. 6, p. 210, Dâr Ihyâ' at-Turâth al-´Arabî, Beirut).

* Some Muslim scholars{{fact}} say that the hadith collectors Bukhari and Muslim applied less stringent standards to hadith relating to history than they did to hadith relating directly to prayer and family law. Hence a historical tradition included in Bukhari or Muslim cannot be presumed to be &quot;strong&quot;.

== Sunni and Shia views of Aisha ==
[[Sunni]] historians praise Aisha as a Mother of Believers and a learned woman, who tirelessly recounted stories from the life of Muhammad and explained Muslim history and traditions. She is considered to be one of the foremost scholars of Islam's early age and is revered as a role model by millions of women.

[[Shi'a]] historians take a much dimmer view of Aisha. They believe that Ali should have been the first caliph, and that the other three caliphs were usurpers. Aisha not only supported [[Umar]], [[Uthman]] and her father [[Abu Bakr]], she also raised an army and fought against [[Ali]], her step-son-in-law. The Shia believe that in opposing Ali, the divinely appointed successor of Muhammad, she committed a grievous sin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ac.pnyx.jpg|thumb|400px|The speaker's platform in the [[Pnyx]], the meeting ground of the assembly where all the great political struggles of Athens were fought during the &quot;Golden Age&quot;. Here Athenian statesmen stood to speak, such as [[Pericles]] and [[Aristides]] in the 5th century BC and [[Demosthenes]] and [[Aeschines]] in the 4th — along with countless humbler citizens as well.  In the background high on the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]] is the [[Parthenon]], the temple of [[Athena]], the city's protective goddess, looking down upon their deliberations.]]

The '''Athenian democracy''' (sometimes called '''classical democracy''') was the [[democracy|democratic]] system developed in the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city-state]] of [[Athens]] (comprising the central city-state of Athens and its surrounding territory [[Attica, Greece|Attica]]). Athens was one of the very first known democracies, and probably the most important in ancient times. Other Greek cities set up democracies, most but not all following an Athenian model, but none were as powerful or as stable (or, relatively speaking, as well-documented) as that of Athens. It remains a unique and intriguing experiment in direct democracy where the people do not elect representatives to vote on their behalf but vote on legislation and executive bills in their own right. Participation was by no means open to all inhabitants of Attica, but the in-group of participants was constituted with no reference to economic class and they participated on a scale that was truly phenomenal. Never before had so many people spent so much of their time in governing themselves.

The dates traditionally given for it are from around 508 BC with its foundation under [[Cleisthenes]] to its suppression under the [[Macedon|Macedonia]]ns in 322 BC. The Athenians themselves however were more likely to talk about it as going back to [[Solon]] almost a century before Cleisthenes, or even to retroject it into their remotest past ([[Theseus]]). There was also a short period of revival in the 4th century BC. Nor was the democratic period entirely continuous; there were two brief takeovers by [[oligarch]]ic [[revolution]]aries.

The word &quot;democracy&quot; combines the elements ''demos'' (&quot;the people&quot;) and ''kratos'' (&quot;force, power&quot;). ''Kratos'' is an unexpectedly brutish word. In the words &quot;monarchy&quot; and &quot;oligarchy&quot;, the second element ''arche'' means rule, leading, or being first. It is possible that the term &quot;democracy&quot; was coined by its detractors who rejected the possibility of, so to speak, a valid &quot;demarchy&quot;. Whatever its original tone, the term was adopted wholeheartedly by Athenian democrats. (The word is attested in some of the earliest Greek prose to survive, but even this may not have been written before 440 or 430 BC. It is not at all certain that the word goes back to the beginning of the democracy, but from around 460 BC at any rate an individual is known whose parents had decided to name him 'Democrates', a name evidently manufactured as a gesture of democratic loyalty.)

==Overview==
===Assembly===
The central events of the Athenian democracy were the meetings of the assembly. Unlike a [[parliament]], the assembly's 'members' were not elected, but attended by right when and if they chose. Members of the Assembly were chosen by lot. It was open only to adult male citizens over the age of 30, but to all of them: unlike earlier schemes there was no property qualification. Although the entire citizen body never gathered in one place at one time, this body did not represent the people — it was them. That is to say, the version of Greek democracy created at Athens was a [[direct democracy]] and not [[representative democracy]]: there was no electorate selecting representatives to decide for them. Members were chosen annually by a form of lottery. It was an honor and a privilege to be part of the Assembly. It was the duty of the individual to attend. 

The ''ekklesia'' had at least four functions: it made executive pronouncements (decrees, such as deciding to go to war or granting citizenship to a foreigner); it elected some officials; it legislated; and it tried political crimes. As the system evolved these last two functions were shifted to the law courts. The standard format was that of speakers making speeches for and against a position followed by a general vote (usually by show of hands) of yes or no. Unlike in modern parliaments, the speeches were actually attempts to persuade those present. Though there might be blocs of opinion, sometimes enduring, on crucial issues, there were no political parties and likewise no [[government]] or [[opposition]] (as in the [[Westminster system]]). In effect, the 'government' was whatever speaker(s) the assembly agreed with on a particular day. Voting was by simple [[majority rule|majority]]. In the 5th century at least there were scarcely any limits on the power exercised by the assembly. If the assembly broke the law, the only thing that might happen is that they would punish those who had made the proposal that they had agreed to. If a mistake had been made, from their viewpoint it could only be because they had been 'misled'.

===Officeholders===
Administration was in the hands of officeholders, over a thousand each year. They were mostly chosen by [[sortition|lot]], with a much smaller (and more prestigious) group [[elected]]. Neither was compulsory; individuals had to nominate themselves for both selection methods. By and large the power exercised by these officials was routine administration and quite limited. In particular, those chosen by lot were citizens acting without particular expertise. This was almost inevitable since, with the notable exception of the generals ([[strategoi]]), each office could be held by the same person only once. Part of the ethos of democracy, however, was the building of general competence by ongoing involvement. In the 5th century version of the democracy, the ten annually elected generals were often very prominent, but for those who had power, it lay primarily in their frequent speeches and in the respect accorded them in the assembly, rather than their vested powers. While citizens voting in the assembly ''were'' the people and so were free of review or punishment, those same citizens when holding an office ''served'' the people and could be punished very severely. All of them were subject to a review beforehand that might disqualify them for office and an examination after stepping down. Officeholders were the agents of the people, not their representatives.

===Council of 500===
The council (''boule'') of 500, the largest board of officeholders, formed a steering committee for the assembly, drafting legislation and setting its agenda. The 500 was selected by a lottery, held each year. A citizen could serve on the council twice in their lifetime. Any citizen could submit proposals to the council for drafting. Technically it was forbidden for the assembly to vote on measures without a pre-proposal (''probouleuma'') from the council. These might be concrete, worked-out proposals or 'open', that is little more than items on the agenda. The council, or rotating sections of it, also served as a kind of front desk for the state, on duty in the council chamber 24 hours a day. Every day of the year one of these councillors was head of state for the day (for instance, holding the keys to the treasury and the seal of the city and being responsible for greeting foreign envoys, and in the 5th century presiding over the assembly and council meetings). It has been calculated that one quarter of all citizens must at one time in their lives have held the post. This head of state position could be held once only in a lifetime.

===Courts===
Courts consisting of massive juries (smallest 200, largest 6000) heard cases argued by litigants (both citizen and non-citizen) without the involvement of lawyers or judges. In particular there was no state prosecutor: all cases, even the most public (e.g. for treason) had to be brought by citizens acting on their own initiative. These juries formed a second site for the expression of popular sovereignty: as in the assembly, citizens acting as jurors acted as the people and were immune from review or punishment. (Notably when the jurors are addressed by speakers as &quot;you&quot;, they can be referred to as having committed any act ever committed by the 'Athenian people', such as battles fought before any of them were born or court decisions made by other juries whose membership may have had no overlap with those currently addressed.) Jurors however had a minimum age of 30 and they were under oath. From an Athenian perspective, where the young are rash and age brings wisdom and where an oath is a serious matter, both of these requirements gave jurors more weight than the citizens attending the assembly. Here only the legislative function of courts will be described, though this by no means exhausts the relevance of the courts to the workings of the democracy.

===Shifting balance between Assembly and Courts===
As the system evolved, the courts (that is, citizens under another guise) intruded upon the power of the assembly. From 355 BC political trials were no longer held in the assembly, but only in a court. In 416 BC the [[graphe paranomon]] (&quot;indictment against measures contrary to the laws&quot;) was introduced. Under this anything passed by the assembly or even proposed but not yet voted on, could be put on hold for review before a jury — which might annul it and perhaps punish the proposer as well. Remarkably, it seems that a measure blocked before the assembly voted on it did not need to go back to the assembly if it survived the court challenge: the court was enough to validate it. Once again it is important to bear in mind the lack of 'neutral' state intervention. To give a schematic scenario by way of illustration: two men have clashed in the assembly about a proposal put by one of them; it passed, and now the two of them go to court with the loser in the assembly prosecuting both the law and its proposer. The quantity of these suits was enormous: in effect the courts became a kind of upper house.

In the 5th century there was in effect no procedural difference between an executive decree and a law: they were both simply passed by the assembly. But from 403 BC they were set sharply apart. Henceforth laws were made not in the assembly, but by special panels of 1000 citizens drawn from the annual jury pool of 6000. They were known as the ''nomothetai'', the lawmakers. Here again it is not anything like a legislative commission sitting down to discuss the pros and cons and drafting proposals, but the format is that of a trial, voting yes or no after a clash of speeches.

===Citizen-initiator===
The institutions sketched above — assembly, officeholders, council, courts — are incomplete without the figure that drove the whole system, ''Ho boulomenos'', he who wishes, or anyone who wishes. This expression encapsulated the right of citizens to take the initiative: to stand to speak in the assembly, to initiate a public  law suit (that is, one held to affect the political community as a whole), to propose a law before the lawmakers or to approach the council with suggestions. Unlike officeholders, the citizen initiator was not vetted before taking up office or automatically reviewed after stepping down — it had after all no set tenure and might be an action lasting only a moment. But any stepping forward into the democratic limelight was risky and if someone chose (another citizen initiator) they could be called to account for their actions and punished. 

The degree of participation among citizens varied greatly, along a spectrum from doing virtually nothing towards something like a fulltime committent. But for even the most active citizen the formal basis of his political activity was the invitation issed to everyone (every qualified free male Athenian citizen) by the phrase &quot;whoever wishes&quot;. There are then three functions: the officeholders organized and saw to the complex protocols; ''Ho boulomenos'' was the initiator and the proposer of content; and finally the people, massed in assembly or court or convened as lawmakers, made the decisions, either yes or no, or choosing between alternatives.

==Participation and exclusion==
===Size and make-up of the Athenian population===
The population of Attica can only be roughly guessed at as the Athenians themselves never conducted a complete census. Numbers of [[slaves]] and [[metic]]s (resident aliens) in particular will have fluctuated. During the [[4th century BC]], the population of Athens may well have comprised some 250,000—300,000 people. Citizen families may have amounted to 100,000 people and out of these some 30,000 will have been the adult male citizens entitled to vote in the assembly. In the mid-5th century the number of adult male citizens was perhaps as high as 60,000, but this number fell precipitously during the Peloponnesian war. This slump was permanent due to the introduction of a stricter definition of citizen described below. From a modern perspective these figures seem pitifully small, but in the world of Greek city-states Athens was huge: most of thousand or so Greek cities could only muster 1000-1500 adult male citizens and Corinth, a major power, had at most 15,000.

The non-citizen component of the population was divided between metics and slaves, with the latter perhaps somewhat more numerous. Around 338 BC the orator [[Hyperides]] (fragment 13) claimed that there were 150,000 slaves in Attica, but this figure is probably not more than an impression: slaves outnumbered those of citizen stock but did not swamp them.

===Citizenship in Athens===
Only adult male Athenian citizens who had completed their military training as [[ephebe]]s &amp;ndash; effectively twenty years and over &amp;ndash; had the right to vote in Athens. This excluded a majority of the population, namely [[Slavery#Slavery in Greece|slaves]], women and resident foreigners ([[metic]]s). Also disallowed were citizens whose rights were under suspension (typically for failure to pay a debt to the city: see [[Atimia (loss of citizen rights)|atimia]]); for some Athenians this amounted to permanent (and in fact inheritable) disqualification. Still, in contrast with oligarchical societies, there were no real property requirements limiting access. (The property classes of [[Solon]]'s constitution remained on the books, but they were a dead letter). Given the exclusionary and ancestral conception of citizenship held by Greek [[city-states]], a relatively  large portion of the population took part in the government of Athens and of other radical democracies like it. At Athens some citizens were far more active than others, but the vast numbers required just for the system to work testify to a breadth of particpation among those eligible that greatly exceeded any present day democracy. 

Athenian citizens had to be legitimately descended from citizens&amp;mdash;after the reforms of Pericles in [[450 BC]] on both sides of the family, excluding the children of Athenian men and foreign women. Although the legislation was not retrospective, five years later the Athenians removed 5000 from the citizen registers when a free gift of corn arrived for all citizens from an Egyptian king. Citizenship could be granted by the assembly and was sometimes given to large groups (Plateans in 427 BC, Samians in 405 BC), but by the 4th century only to individuals and by a special vote with a quorum of 6000. This was generally done as a reward for some service to the state. In the course of a century the numbers involved were in the hundreds rather than thousands. This reflected the general conception of the ''polis'' as a community, somewhat like an extended family, rather than as a territorial state.

Modern democracies too have their own exclusions: resident foreigners (legal and otherwise), individuals below a certain age and in some cases incarcerated citizens and those who have committed felonies.  The modern form has other limitations as well: the right of voting is usually restricted to once every several years, and voters merely get to choose their representatives in the legislative or executive branches&amp;mdash;and it is these representatives, not the voters themselves, who make policy decisions (with the exception of occasional [[referendum|referenda]]).

==Main bodies of governance==
There were three political bodies where citizens gathered in numbers running into the hundreds or thousands. These are the assembly (in some cases with a quorum of 6000), the council of 500 (''[[boule]]'') and the courts (a minumum of 200 people, but running at least on some occasions up to 6000). Of these three bodies it is the assembly and the courts that were the true sites of power — although courts, unlike the assembly, were never simply called the ''demos'' (the People) as they were manned by a subset of the citizen body, those over thirty. But crucially citizens voting in both were not liable to review and prosecution as were council members and all other officeholders. In the 5th century BC we often hear of the assembly sitting as a court of judgement itself for trials of political importance and it is not a coincidence that 6000 is the number both for the full quorum for the assembly and for the annual pool from which jurors were picked for particular trials. By the mid-4th century however the assembly's judicial functions were largely curtailed, though it always kept a role in the initiation of various kinds of political trial.

===Council of 500===
The council (''boule'') of 500, the largest board of officeholders, formed a steering committee for the assembly, drafting legislation and setting its agenda. A citizen could serve on the council twice in their lifetime. Any citizen could submit proposals to the council for drafting. Technically it was forbidden for the assembly to vote on measures without a pre-proposal (''probouleuma'') from the council. These might be concrete, worked-out proposals or 'open', that is little more than items on the agenda. The council, or rotating sections of it, also served as a kind of front desk for the state, on duty in the council chamber 24 hours a day. Every day of the year one of these councillors was head of state for the day (for instance, holding the keys to the treasury and the seal of the city and being responsible for greeting foreign envoys, and in the 5th century presiding over the assembly and council meetings). It has been calculated that one quarter of all citizens must at one time in their lives have held the post. This head of state position could be held once only in a lifetime.

===Assembly===
As usual in ancient democracies, one had to physically attend a gathering in order to vote. Military service or simple distance prevented the exercise of citizenship. Voting was usually by show of hands (cheirotonia, &quot;arm stretching&quot;) with officials 'judging' the outcome by sight. With thousands of people attending, counting was impossible. For a small category of votes a quorum of 6000 was required, principally grants of citizenship, and here coloured balls were used, white for yes and black for no. Probably at the end of the session, each voter tossed one of these into a large clay jar which was afterwards cracked open for the counting of the ballots. ([[Ostracism]] required to voters to scratch names onto pieces of broken pottery, though this did not occur within the assembly as such.) 

In the 5th century BC, there were 10 fixed assembly meetings per year, one in each of the ten [[Attic calendar#State calendar|state months]], with other meetings called as needed. In the following century the meetings were set to forty a year, with four in each state month. (One of these was now as the main meeting, ''kuria ekklesia''.) Additional meetings might still be called, especially as up until 355 BC there were still political trials that were conducted in the assembly rather than in court. The assembly meetings did not occur at fixed intervals, as they had to dodge the annual festivals that were differently placed in each of the twelve lunar months. There was also a tendency for the four meetings to bunch up toward the end of each state month.

Attendance at the assembly was voluntary. In the 5th century public slaves forming a cordon with a red-stained rope herded citizens from the [[agora]] into the assembly meeting place (''[[pnyx]]''), with a fine for those who got the red on their clothes. This, however, cannot compare with the compulsory voting schemes of some modern democracies. It was rather an immediate measure to get enough people rapidly in place, like an aggressive form of ushering. After the restoration of the democracy in 403 BC, pay for assembly attendance was introduced for the first time. At this there was a new enthusiasm for assembly meetings. Only the first 6000 to arrive were admitted and paid, with the red rope now used to keep latecomers at bay. These two uses of the red rope are known from [[Aristophanes]]'s comedy ''Acharnians'' 17-22, the forcing in, and his ''Ekklesiazousai'' 378-9 for the keeping out.

===Athenian Courts===
Athens had an elaborate legal system centred on the '''''dikasteria''''' or jury courts: the word is derived from '''''dikastes''''', 'judge/juror.' These [[Athenian law court (classical period)|jury courts]] were manned by large panels selected by lot from an annual pool of 6,000 citizens. To be eligible to serve as juror, a citizen had to be over 30 years of age and in possession of full citizen rights (see [[atimia (loss of citizen rights)|atimia]]). The age limit, the same as that for office holders but ten years older than that required for participation in the assembly, gave the courts a certain standing in relation to the assembly: for the Athenians older was wiser. Added to this was the fact that jurors were under oath, which was not a feature of attendance at the assembly. However, the authority exercised by the courts had the same basis as that of the assembly: both were regarded as expressing the direct will of the people. Unlike office holders (magistrates) who could be impeached and prosecuted for misconduct, the jurors could not be censured, for they, in effect, were the people and no authority could be higher than that. A corollary of this was that, at least in words spoken before the jurors, if a court had made an unjust decision, it must have been because it had been misled by a litigant

Essentially there were two grades of suit, a smaller kind known as ''dike'' or private suit, and a larger kind known as ''graphe'' or public suit. For private suits the minimum jury size was 201 (increased to 401 if a sum of over 1000 drachmas was at issue), for public suits 501. For particularly important public suits the jury could be increased by adding in extra allotments of 500. One thousand and 1500 are regularly encountered as jury sizes and on at least one occasion, the first time a new kind of case was brought to court (see [[graphe paranomon]]), all 6,000 members of the juror pool were put onto the one case. In public suits the litgants each had something like three hours to speak, less in private suits.

The cases were put by the litigants themselves in the form of an exchange of single speeches timed by water clock, first prosecutor then defendant. In a public suit the litigants each had three hours to speak, much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake). Decisions were made by voting without any time set aside for deliberation. Nothing, however, stopped jurors from talking informally amongst themselves during the voting procedure and juries could be rowdy shouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants. This may have had some role in building a consensus. The jury could only cast a 'yes' or 'no' vote as to the guilt and sentence of the defendant. For private suits only the victims or their families could prosecute, while for public suits anyone (''ho boulomenos'', 'whoever wants to' i.e. any citizen with full citizen rights) could bring a case since the issues in these major suits were regarded as affecting the community as a whole. 

Justice was rapid: no case could last no longer than one day. Some convictions triggered an automatic penalty, but where this was not the case the two litgants each proposed a penalty for the convicted defendant and the jury chose between them in a further vote. No appeal was possible. There was however a mechanism for prosecuting the witnesses of a successful prosecutor, which it appears could lead to the undoing of the earlier verdict.

Payment for jurors was introduced around 462 BC and is ascribed to [[Pericles]], a feature described by Aristotle as fundamental to radical democracy (''Politics'' 1294a37). Pay was raised from 2 to 3 [[obol]]s by [[Cleon]] early in the Peloponnesian war and there it stayed; the original amount is not known. Notably this was introduced more than fifty years before payment for attendance at assembly meetings. Running the courts was one of the major expenses of the Athenian state and there were moments of financial crisis in the 4th century when the courts, at least for private suits, had to be suspended.

The system shows a marked anti-professionalism. No judges presided over the courts nor was there anyone to give legal direction to the jurors, as the magistrates in charge of the courts had only an administrative function and were themselves in any case amateurs (most of the annual magistracies at Athens could only be held once in a lifetime). There were no lawyers as such, but the litigants acted solely in their capacity as citizens. Whatever professionalism there was tended to disguise itself: it was possible to pay for the services of a speechwriter (''logographos'') but this was not advertised in court (except as something your opponent in court has had to resort to), and even politically prominent litigants made some show of disowning special expertise.

==Officeholders== 
Citizens active as office holders served in a quite different capacity from when they voted in the assembly or served as jurors. The assembly and the courts were regarded as the instantiation of the people of Athens: they were the people, no power was above them and they could not be reviewed, impeached or punished. However, when an Athenian took up an office, he was regarded as 'serving' the people. As such, he could be regarded as failing in his duty and be punished for it. There were two methods of selecting people as officeholders, lottery or election. Something like 1100 citizens (including the memebrs of the council of 500) held office each year and about a 100 of these were elected. 

===Selection by lot (Allotment)===
Selection by lottery was the standard means as it was regarded as the more democratic: elections will favour those who are rich, noble, eloquent and well-known, while [[sortition|allotment]] spreads the work of administration throughout the whole citizen body, engaging them in the crucial democratic experience of, to use Aristotle's words (Politics 1317b28-30), &quot;ruling and being ruled in turn.&quot; The allotment of an individual was based on citizenship rather than merit or any form of personal popularity which could be bought. Allotment therefore was seen as a means to prevent the corrupt purchase of votes and it gave citizens a unique form of political equality as all had an equal chance of obtaining government office.

Individuals who were interested in holding office had to nominate themselves as available for selection the year before. Officeholders were paid a stipend, but it was intended as a small sum to cover loss of income fixed at the lowest end of the scale. That is, virtually anyone able to work could earn more elsewhere. Payment is confirmed for the 5th century; was cancelled under the oligarchs in 404; may or may not have been restored after democracy was reinstituted. 

The random assignment of responsibility to individuals who may or may not be competent has obvious risks, but the system included features meant to obviate possible problems. Athenians selected for office served as teams (boards, panels). In a group someone will know the right way to do things and those that do not may learn from those that do. During the period of holding a particular office everyone on the team is observing everybody else. There were however officials such as the nine archons, who while seemingly a board carried out very different functions from each other.

There were in fact some limitations on who could hold office. Age restrictions were in place with thirty (and in some cases forty) years as a minimum, rendering something like a third of the adult citizen body ineligible at any one time. An unknown proportion of citizens were also subject to disenfranchisement ([[Atimia (loss of citizen rights)|atimia]]), excluding some of them permanently and others temporarily (depending on the type). Furthermore, all citizens selected were reviewed before taking up office (''dokimasia'') at which they might be disqualified. Competence does not seem to have been the main issue, but rather, at least in the 4th century BC, whether they were loyal democrats or had oligarchic tendencies. After leaving office they were subject to a scrutiny (''euthunai'', literally 'straightenings') to review their performance. Both of these processes were in most cases brief and formulaic, but they opened up in the possibility, if some citizen wanted to take some matter up, of a contest before a jury court. In the case of a scrutiny going to trial, there was the risk for the former officeholder of suffering severe penalties. Finally, even during his period of office, any officeholder could be impeached and removed from office by the assembly. In each of the ten &quot;main meetings&quot; (''kuriai ekklesiai'') a year, the question was explicitly raised in the assembly agenda: were the office holders carrying out their duties correctly?

No office appointed by lot could be held twice by the same individual. The only exception was the boule or council of 500. In this case, simply by demographic necessity, an individual could serve twice in a lifetime. This principle extended down to the secretaries and undersecretaries who served as assistants to magistrates such as the archons. To the Athenians it seems what had to be guarded against was not incompetence but any tendency to use office as a way of accumulating ongoing power.

The powers of officials were precisely defined and their capacity for imitative limited. They administered rather than governed. When it came to penal sanctions, no officeholder could impose a fine over fifty drachmas fine. Anything higher had to go before a court.

===Elected===
Something like a hundred officials were elected rather than chosen by lot. There were two main categories in this group: those required to handle large sums of money, and the 10 generals, the ''[[strategoi]]''. One reason that financial officials were elected was that any money [[embezzled]] could be recovered from their estates; election in general strongly favoured the rich, but in this case wealth was virtually a prerequisite. 

Generals were elected not only because their role required expert knowledge but also because they needed to be people with experience and contacts in the wider Greek world where wars were fought. In the [[5th century BC]], principally as seen through the figure of [[Pericles]], the generals could be among the most powerful people in the state. Yet in the case of Pericles it is wrong to see his power as coming from his long series of annual generalships (each year along with nine others). His office holding was rather an expression and a result of the influence he wielded. That influence was based on his relation with the assembly, a relation that in the first instance lay simply in the right of any citizen to stand and speak before the people. Under the [[4th century|4th century]] version of democracy the roles of general and of key political speaker in the assembly tended to be filled by different persons. In part this was a consequence of the increasingly specialised forms of warfare practiced in the later period.

Elected officials too were subject to review before holding office and scrutiny after office. And they too could be removed from office any time the assembly met. In one case from the [[5th century BC]] the 10 treasurers of the [[Delian]] league (the ''hellenotamiai'') were accused at their scrutinies of misappropriation of funds. Put on trial, they were condemned and executed one by one until before the trial of the tenth and last an error of accounting was discovered, allowing him to go free. ([[Antiphon]] 5.69-70)

==Individualism in Athenian democracy==
Another interesting insight into Athenian democracy comes from the law that excluded from decisions of war those citizens who had property close to the city walls - on the basis that they had a personal interest in the outcome of such debates because the practice of an invading army was at the time to destroy the land outside the walls. A good example of the contempt the first democrats felt for those who did not participate in politics can be found in the modern word 'idiot' that finds its origins in the ancient Greek word {{polytonic|&amp;#x1f30;&amp;#948;&amp;#953;&amp;#x1f7d;&amp;#964;&amp;#951;&amp;#962;}} (idi&amp;#333;t&amp;#275;s) meaning a private person, a person who is not actively interested in politics; such characters were talked about with contempt and the word eventually acquired its modern meaning.

==Criticism of the democracy==
Athenian democracy has had many critics, both ancient and modern. Modern critics are more likely to find fault with the narrow definition of the citizen body, but in the ancient world the complaint if anything went in the opposite direction. Ancient authors were almost invariably from an elite background for whom giving poor and uneducated people power over their betters seemed a reversal of the proper, rational order of society. For them the ''demos'' in democracy meant not the whole people, but the people as opposed to the elite. Instead of seeing it as a fair system under which 'everyone' has equal rights, they saw it as the numerically preponderant poor tyrannising over the rich. They viewed society like a modern stock company: democracy is like a company where all shareholders have an equal say regardless of the scale of their holding; one share or ten thousand, it makes no difference. They regarded this as manifestly unjust. In Aristotle this is categorised as the difference between 'arithmetic' and 'geometric' (i.e. proportional) equality. Democracy was far from being the normal style of governance and the beliefs on which it was based were in effect a minority opinion. Those writing in later centuries generally had no direct experience of democracy themselves. 

To its ancient detractors the democracy was reckless and arbitrary. They had some signal instances to point to, especially from the long years of the Peloponnesian war.
*In 406 BC, after years of defeats in the wake of the annihilation of their vast invasion force in Sicily, the Athenians at last won a naval victory at [[Battle of Arginusae| Arginusae]] over the Spartans. After the battle a storm arose and the eight [[strategoi|generals]] in command failed to collect survivors: the Athenians sentenced all of them to death. Technically, it was illegal, as the generals were tried and sentenced together, rather than one by one as Athenian law required. [[Socrates]] happened to be the citizen presiding over the assembly that day and refused to cooperate, though to little effect. Standing against the idea that it was outrageous for the people to be unable to do whatever they wanted. Later they repented the executions, but made up for it by executing those who had accused the generals before them. (A long account in [[Xenophon]] ''Hellenica'' 1.7.1-35)
*Years earlier, the ten treasurers of the [[Delian league]] (''Hellenotamiai'') had been accused of embezzlement. They were tried and executed one after the other until, when only one was still alive, the accounting error was discovered and that last surviving treasurer was acquitted. Perfectly legal in this case, but an example of the extreme severity with which the people could punish those who served them. ([[Antiphon]] 5.69-70)
*In 399 BC [[Socrates]] himself was put on trial and executed for 'corrupting the young and believing in strange gods'. His death gave Europe its first ever intellectual hero and martyr, but guaranteed the democracy an eternity of bad press at the hands of his disciple [[Plato]]. In the [[Gorgias]] written years later Plato has [[Socrates]] contemplating the possibility of himself on trial before the Athenians: he says he would be like a doctor prosecuted by a pastry chef before a jury of children.

Two right wing coups briefly interrupted democratic rule during the Peloponnesian war, both named by the numbers in control: the Four Hundred in 411 BC and the [[Thirty Tyrants|Thirty]] in 404 BC. The focus on number speaks to the drive behind each of them: to reduce the size of the electorate by linking the franchise with property qualifications. Though both ended up as rogue governments and did not follow through on their constitutional promises, they began as responses from the Athenian elite to what they saw as the inherent arbitrariness of government by the masses. (Plato in the ''Seventh Epistle'' does remark that the Thirty made the preceding democratic regime look like a Golden Age.) 

Whether the democratic failures should be seen as systematic, or as a product of the extreme conditions of the Peloponnesian war, there does seem to have been a move toward correction. A new version of democracy was established from 403 BC, but it can be linked with both earlier and subsequent reforms ([[graphe paranomon]] 416 BC; end of assembly trials 355 BC). For the first time a conceptual and procedural distinction was made between laws and decrees. Increasingly, responsibility was shifted from the assembly to the courts, with laws being made by jurors and all assembly decisions becoming reviewable by courts. That is to say, the mass meeting of all citizens lost some ground to smaller gatherings (of only a thousand or so!) which were under oath, free of men in their impetuous 20's and with more time to focus on just one matter (though never more than a day). One downside was that the new democracy was less capable of rapid response.

Another tack of criticism is to notice the disquieting links between democracy and a number of less than appealing features of Athenian life. Although it predated it by over thirty years, democracy is strongly bound up with Athenian imperialism. For much of the 5th century at least democracy fed off an empire of subject states. [[Thucydides son of Milesias|Thucydides]] the son of Milesias (not the historian), an aristocrat, stood in opposition to these policies, for which he was ostracised in 443 BC. At times the imperialist democracy acted with extreme brutality, as in the decision to execute the entire male population of [[Melos]] and sell off its woman and children simply for refusing to became subjects of Athens. The common people were numerically dominant in the navy, which they used to pursue their own interests in the form of work as rowers and in the hundreds of overseas administrative positions. Further they used the income from empire to fund payment for officeholding. This is the position set out by the anti-democratic pamphlet known whose anonymous author is often called the [[Old Oligarch]]. On the other hand the empire was, more or less, defunct in the 4th century BC so it cannot be said that it was democracy was not viable without it. Only then in fact was payment for assembly attendance, the central event of democracy. (Similarly for the period before the Persian wars, but for the very early democracy the sources are very meagre and it can be thought of as being in an embryonic state.)

A case can be made that discriminatory lines came to be drawn more sharply under Athenian democracy than before or elsewhere, in particular in relation to woman and slaves, as well as in the line between citizens and non-citizens. By so strongly validating one role, that of the male citizen, it has been argued that democracy compromised the status of those who did not share it.
*Male citizenship had become a newly valuable, indeed profitable, possession, to be jealously guarded. Under [[Pericles]] in 450 BC restrictions were tightened so that a citizen had to be born from citizen parentage on both sides. ''Metroxenoi'', those with foreign mothers, were now to be excluded. Traditionally for the poorer citizens local marriage was the norm, while the elite had been much more likely to marry abroad as a part of aristocratic alliance building. A habit of one group in society was thus codified as a law for the whole citizen body, which thus lost one axis of openness. Many Athenians prominent earlier in the century would have lost citizenship, had this law applied to them: [[Cleisthenes]], the founder of democracy, had a non-Athenian mother, and the mothers of [[Cimon]] and [[Themistocles]] were not Greek at all, but [[Thrace|Thracian]]. As Athens attracted an increasing number of resident aliens (''[[metic]]s''), this shift in the definition of citizen worked to keep the immigrant population more sharply distinguished politically.
*Likewise the status of women seems lower in Athens than in many Greek cities. At Sparta women competed in public exercise — so in [[Aristophanes]]' ''Lysistrata'' the Athenian women admire the tanned, muscular bodies of their Sparten counterparts — and women could own property in their own right, as they could not at Athens. [[Misogyny]] was by no means an Athenian invention, but it has been claimed that in regard to gender democracy generalised a harsher set of values derived, again, from the common people. Democracy may well have been impossible without the contribution of women's labour (Hansen 1987: 318).
*[[Slavery in antiquity|Slave]] use was more widespread at Athens than in other Greek cities. Indeed the extensive use of imported non-Greeks (&quot;[[barbarian]]s&quot;) as [[chattel slavery|chattel slaves]] seems to have been an Athenian development. This triggers the parodoxical question: Was democracy &quot;based on&quot; slavery? It does seem clear that possession of slaves allowed even poorer Athenians — owning a few slaves was by no means equated with wealth — to devote more of their time to political life. But whether democracy depended on this extra time is impossible to say. The breadth of slave ownership also meant that the leisure of the rich (the small minority who were actually free of the need to work) rested less than it would have on the exploitation of their less well-off fellow citizens. Working for wages was clearly regarded as subjection to the will of another, but at least debt servitude had been abolished at Athens (under the reforms of Solon at the start of the 6th century BC). By allowing a new kind of equality among citizens this opened the way to democracy, which in turn called for a new means, chattel slavery, to at least partially equalise the availability of leisure between rich and poor. In the absence of reliable statistics all these connections remain speculative. However, as [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] pointed out, other societies also kept slaves, yet did not develop democracy. Even with respect to slavery the new citizen law of 450 BC may have had effect: it is speculated that originally Athenian fathers had been able to register for citizenship offspring had with slave women (Hansen 1987:53). This will have rested on an older, less categorical sense of what it meant to be a slave.

Contemporary opponents of [[majoritarianism]] (arguably the principle behind Athenian democracy) call it an illiberal regime (in contrast to [[liberal democracy]]) that allegedly leads to [[anomie]], [[balkanization]] and [[xenophobia]]. Proponents (especially of majoritarianism) deny these accusations, and argue that any faults in Athenian democracy were due to the fact that the franchise was quite limited (only male citizens could vote - women, slaves and non-citizens were excluded). Despite this limited franchise, Athenian democracy was certainly the first - and perhaps the best - example of a working [[direct democracy]].

[[Image:Numerals.png|thumb|240px|right|Numerals [[sans serif]]]]
'''Arabic numerals''', also known as '''[[Hindu-Arabic numerals]]''', '''[[Indian numerals]]''', '''[[Hindu numerals]]''', '''[[European numerals]]''', and '''Western numerals''', are the most common [[Symbol|symbolic]] representation of [[number]]s around the world. They are considered an important milestone in the development of [[mathematics]].

One may distinguish between the [[decimal]] system involved, also known as the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]], and the precise [[glyph]]s used. The glyphs most commonly in conjunction with the [[Latin alphabet]] since [[Early modern Europe|Early Modern]] times are &lt;big&gt;[[0 (number)|0]] [[1 (number)|1]] [[2 (number)|2]] [[3 (number)|3]] [[4 (number)|4]] [[5 (number)|5]] [[6 (number)|6]] [[7 (number)|7]] [[8 (number)|8]] [[9 (number)|9]]&lt;/big&gt;. 

The system was developed in [[India]] by the [[Hindus]] around [[400 BCE]], found its way to [[Persia]], and was relayed to Europe by Arabs. Hence, they became known in the West as &quot;Arabic numerals&quot;. The glyphs underwent some modifications en route from India to Europe.

==Description==
{{main articles|[[Algorism]] and [[glyphs used with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system]]}}

The numeral system employed, known as [[Algorism]], is [[positional notation|positional]] [[decimal]] notation.

Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the [[Hindu-Arabic numerals (system)|Hindu-Arabic numeral system]], all of which evolved from the [[Brahmi numerals]]. The symbols used to represent the system have split into various typographical variants since the [[Middle Ages]]:
*the widespread Western &quot;Arabic numerals&quot; used with the [[Latin alphabet]], in the table below labelled &quot;European&quot;, descended from the &quot;West Arabic numerals&quot; which were developed in [[al-Andalus]] and the [[Maghreb]] (There are two [[typographic]] styles for rendering European numerals, known as lining figures and [[text figures]]).
*the &quot;Arabic-Indic&quot; or &quot;'''[[Eastern Arabic numerals]]'''&quot; used with the [[Arabic alphabet]], developed primarily in what is now [[Iraq]].   A variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals used in Persian and Urdu languages as shown as &quot;East Arabic-Indic&quot;. 
*the &quot;Devanagari numerals&quot; used with [[Devanagari]] and related variants grouped as '''[[Indian numerals]]'''.

==History==

===Origins===
{{main|History of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system}}
[[Buddhist]] inscriptions from around 300 BCE use the symbols which became 1, 4 and 6. One century later, their use of the symbols which became 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 was recorded.
[[Image:Indian numerals 100AD.gif|frame|left|[[Brahmi numeral]]s  in [[India]] in the first century CE]]
The system was adopted by the Arabs in the [[8th century]]. The first certain positional use of zero dates to the [[9th century]], in  an inscription at [[Gwalior]] dated to [[870]], and in the work of [[Al-Khwarizmi]].

[[Image:EgyptphoneKeypad.jpg|right|thumb|Modern day Arab telephone keypad with Hindu-Arabic numerals and corresponding Arabic-language numerals]]
The numeral system came to be known to both the [[Persians|Persian]] mathematician [[Al-Khwarizmi]], whose book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'' written about [[825]], and the [[Arab]] mathematician [[Al-Kindi]], who wrote four volumes, &quot;On the Use of the Indian Numerals&quot; (Ketab fi Isti'mal al-'Adad al-Hindi) about [[830]], are principally responsible for the diffusion of the Indian system of numeration in the [[Middle-East]] and the West [http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html]. In the [[10th century]], [[Middle-East]]ern mathematicians extended the decimal numeral system to include fractions, as recorded in a treatise by [[Syrian]] mathematician [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] in [[952]]-[[953]].

In the Arab World&amp;mdash;until modern times&amp;mdash;the Arabic numeral system was used only by mathematicians. Muslim scientists used the [[Babylonian_numerals|Babylonian numeral system]], and merchants used the [[Abjad numerals]]. Therefore, it was not until [[Fibonacci]] that the Arabic numeral system was used by a large population.

===West Arabic numerals===
A distinctive &quot;West Arabic&quot; variant of the symbols begins to emerge in ca. the [[10th century]] in the [[Maghreb]] and [[Al-Andalus]], called the ''ghubar'' (&quot;sand-table&quot; or &quot;dust-table&quot;) numerals.

The first mentions of the numerals in the West are found in the Codex Vigilanus of [[976]] [http://www.mathorigins.com/V.htm]. From the [[980s]], [[Pope Silvester II|Gerbert of Aurillac]] began to spread knowledge of the numerals in Europe. Gerbert studied in [[Barcelona]] in his youth, and he is known to have requested mathematical treatises concerning the [[astrolabe]] from [[Lupitus of Barcelona]] after he had returned to France.

===Adoption in Europe===
[[Image:Talhoffer_Thott_140r.jpg|thumb|300px|German manuscript page teaching use of Arabic numerals ([[Hans Talhoffer|Talhoffer]] Thott, [[1459]]). At this time, knowledge of the numerals was still widely seen as esoteric, and Talhoffer teaches them together with the [[Hebrew alphabet]] and [[astrology]].]]
[[Image:Petrus Astronomus Astronomical clock in Uppsala Cathedral.jpg|thumb|300px|Woodcut showing the 16th century [[astronomical clock]] of [[Uppsala]] cathedral, with two clockfaces, one with Arabic and one with Roman numerals.]]
[[Image:Horloge-republicaine1.jpg|thumb|250px|Late 18th century French revolutionary &quot;decimal&quot; clockface.]] 

[[Al-Khwarizmi]]'s [[825]] treatise ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'' was  translated into Latin in the [[12th century]], as ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum'' (''Algoritmi'' being the translator's rendition of the author's name, ''{{Unicode|al-ḫwārizmī}}'',  ultimately leading to the term [[algorithm]]).

[[Leonardo of Pisa|Fibonacci]], an [[Italy|Italian]] mathematician who had studied in [[Bejaia]] ([[Bougie]]), [[Algeria]], promoted the Arabic numeral system in [[Europe]] with his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', which was published in [[1202]], still describing the numerals as &quot;Indian&quot; rather than &quot;Arabic&quot;.  

:&quot;When my father, who had been appointed by his country as public notary in the customs at Bugia acting for the Pisan merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned me to him while I was still a child, and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and receive instruction in the school of accounting. There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it..&quot; 

The numerals are arranged with their lowest value digit to the right, with higher value positions added to the left. This arrangement was adopted identically into the numerals as used in Europe. The Latin alphabet running from left to right, unlike the Arabic alphabet, this resulted in an inverse arrangement of the place-values relative to the direction of reading.

The European acceptance of the numerals was accelerated by the invention of the [[printing press]], and they became commonly known during the [[15th century]]. The first known use in [[England]] was on a 1487 inscription (the date being written in Arabic numerals) at [[Piddletrenthide]] church, [[Dorset]]. By the mid [[16th century]], they were in common use in most of Europe.[http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52545.html.] Roman numerals remained in use mostly for the notation of years of the [[Common Era]], and for numbers on clockfaces. Sometimes, Roman numerals are still used for enumeration of lists (as an alternative to alphabetical enumeration), and numbering pages in prefatory material in books.

==Encodings==

The Arabic numerals are encoded in [[ASCII]] (and [[Unicode]]) at positions 48 to 57:
