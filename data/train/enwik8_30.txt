Moore's most popular comic work, ''Watchmen'' , is about superheroes who have been affected by real world politics.  [[McCarthyism]], the [[Vietnam War]], and the [[Cold War]] have unhinged the current superhero generation.

''Watchmen'' deconstructed the superhero, looking at the moral, psychological, and sexual implications of their activities.  His most far reaching work to date, ''Watchmen'' addressed such issues as free will, the nature of time, human psychology, global politics, and moral relativism.

''Watchmen'' incorporated cinema style transitions and voice overs.  It avoided the then typically-used comic book thought bubble.

''Watchmen'' is the only comic to be granted an honorary [[Hugo award]]. Moore said it was his final statement on superheroes, and, upon completing his commitment of ''Miracleman'', retired from mainstream comics.

The copyright of ''Watchmen'' would revert to Moore and artist Dave Gibbons if it is ever taken out of print; it has been constantly successful&amp;ndash;it remains in print (and under the control of DC) to this day.

===Supreme===
{{main|Supreme (comics)}}
Moore was asked by publisher Rob Liefeld to write further adventures of ''Supreme'', Liefeld's violent, inconsistently-written Superman knockoff.  Moore agreed on the condition that he could throw out everything previously done with the character, as he felt the comic was not very good, and turned the series into a post-modern homage to the innocence and imagination of [[Mort Weisinger]]'s Superman.

Beginning with issue #41, Moore began developing a new approach to comic storytelling and the Superhero.  ''Supreme'' is a complex comic, containing layers upon layers of metafiction, each issue containing further comment on the nature of comics history, storytelling, and the Superman mythos.

Supreme's secret identity is Ethan Crane, a mild-mannered artist for Dazzle Comics.  When not saving the world as the archetypical superhero, he illustrates the adventures of Omniman, an ultra-violent Supreme-like character going under a relaunch with a change of writers.  In the first issue, Supreme discovers he is living in the most recent &quot;revision,&quot; as reality is an ever-changing story and there have been many versions of himself who came before.  Retired Supremes live in the &quot;Supremacy&quot;, an afterlife for characters whose stories have come to an end.  

Supreme learns that his memories are &quot;backstory&quot; gradually being filled in until his real memories are indistinguishable from the filled-in, never-happened ones of the past.  Flashback Supreme sequences are told in the comic style of the era, reflecting different periods of comics history.

Moore's run on Supreme has been collected in two trade paperback volumes, &quot;Story Of The Year&quot; and &quot;The Return&quot;.

===From Hell===
{{main|From Hell}}

[[Image:From hell tpb.jpg|right|thumb|The cover of the ''From Hell'' collected edition. Art by [[Eddie Campbell]].]]

''From Hell'' is, in a different way, as intricately constructed as ''Watchmen'', but this time the intricacy is not of form but of message. It was partly inspired by [[Douglas Adams]]' novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]''; to solve a crime [[holism|holistically]], one would need to solve the entire society it occurred in. Moore's take on the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders is not a &quot;[[whodunit]]&quot;: he spells out his (fictional) culprit and the reasons for his actions very early on. ''From Hell'' takes [[Stephen Knight]]'s largely discredited ''Final Solution'', slightly modified, as its starting point (see [[Jack the Ripper royal conspiracy theories]]): the killer is Sir [[William Withey Gull]], the royal surgeon, silencing all those who knew about [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence|Prince Albert Victor]]'s illegitimate child. But as Gull remarks, &quot;Averting Royal embarrassment is but the fraction of my work that's visible above the waterline.&quot;

The murders are an occult ritual, a complex sacrifice using Victorian [[London]] itself as an altar. The symbolism of London's landmarks is explored in a ''tour de force'' chapter, in which Gull explains his motives to his uncomprehending coachman. Women had power over men once, Gull believes, and the irrational, [[Dionysus|Dionysian]] unconscious mind once dominated the rational, [[Apollo|Apollonian]] conscious mind. Gull is reason's lunatic, carrying out an act of magic to enforce the rational, masculine hegemony. Following the murder of Marie Kelly, Gull claims to have &quot;delivered&quot; the twentieth century, a mysterious statement perhaps clarified by the conception of [[Adolf Hitler]], depicted at the beginning of Chapter 5, which must have taken place in the month of the murders.

On a more prosaic level, Moore indicts the inequalities of Victorian society, contrasting Gull and the wealthy circles he moves in with the hand-to-mouth existence of the women he targets, the moral disgust shown at the peccadilloes of the poor with the depths the rich are prepared to sink to to protect the appearance of propriety, the imaginary [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] conspiracy theories which divert the police's investigations with the real conspiracy that controls them. Just about every notable figure of the period is connected with the events in some way, from [[Joseph Merrick]], the &quot;Elephant Man&quot;, to [[Oscar Wilde]], from the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] writer [[Black Elk]] to [[William Morris]], the artist [[Walter Sickert]] to [[Aleister Crowley]], who makes a brief appearance as a young boy in short trousers, sucking on a candy cane, and lecturing the police about magic.

Almost none of this made it into the film adaptation, which merely dramatised Knight's theory as a &quot;whodunnit&quot;, with the addition of a psychic, [[opium]]-addicted police detective, who bears some superficial similarities to Sherlock Holmes.  The finished film thus has many points of comparison with the 1979 [[Bob Clark]]-directed ''[[Murder by Decree]]'', which featured Holmes catching the Ripper in a dramatisation of the Knight theory.

Moore has always been at pains to point out that ''From Hell'' is fiction, and that he used Knight's theory for its artistic potential rather than its accuracy, yet he included an &quot;author's statement&quot; in the serialised publication of the epilogue which consisted of a blown-up panel from the prologue, depicting the psychic [[Robert Lees (psychic)|Robert Lees]] confessing that although his visions were accurate, they were fraudulent: &quot;I made it all up, and it all came true anyway. That's the funny part.&quot;

==Prose==
Moore has written a novel, ''[[Voice of the Fire]]'', a set of short stories about linked events in his home-town of Northampton through the centuries, from the [[Bronze Age]] to the present day.

==Film==
Moore has written one [[screenplay]], the unmade ''Fashion Beast'', a recreation  of ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' commissioned by [[Malcolm McLaren]]. Two of his comics, ''From Hell'' and ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'', have been made into Hollywood movies, and the film ''Constantine'' was based upon the character John Constantine, which Moore created during his ''Swamp Thing'' run; however, Moore has been disappointed by the adaptations and refused to accept any money for any future film adaptations of his work, donating it instead to the artists with whom he created the respective characters. Nonetheless, a film of ''V for Vendetta'' is due for release in March 2006, written by the [[Wachowski brothers]] and starring [[Natalie Portman]]. Again, Moore requested that his name not be associated with the film, after seeing the script and calling it &quot;imbecilic&quot;. After a press release falsely reported that Moore supported the film, Moore cut all of his ties with [[DC Comics]], removing the last project he had with the company, ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'', from their lineup.

==Music and performance art==
Alan Moore has also made brief forays into music. Notably, with ex-[[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] musician [[David Jay]] and [[Max Akropolis]], he formed a band known as [[The Sinister Ducks]] and released a single, &quot;March of the Sinister Ducks&quot;, under the pseudonym Translucia Baboon. Moore and Jay also released a [[12-inch single]] featuring a recording of &quot;Vicious Cabaret&quot;, from ''V for Vendetta''. He has also performed with the Northampton band Emperors of Ice Cream.

Moore is a practising magician, having become a [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] in the mid-1990s, and part of a [[performance art]] group, the Moon and Serpent Grand Egyptian Theatre of Marvels. Several of their pieces have been released on CD, and two, ''[[The Birth Caul]]'' and ''[[Snakes and Ladders]]'', have been adapted for comics by [[Eddie Campbell]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">General '''Abdul Rashid Dostum''' (also '''Abdurrashid Dostum''', born 1954), a powerful ethnic [[Uzbek]] [[warlord]] is the principal leader of Afghanistan's Uzbek community. He current holds the honorific position of &quot;Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Afghan Armed Forces&quot;.

He is leader of Junbish Milli / [[Junbesh-i Melli]]-i Islami, Jombesh-e Melli Islami ([[National Islamic Movement Afghanistan]]).  He later joined the communist government, serving as defense minister for President Muhammad Najibullah, until the mujahideen defeated it in 1992.

One of the best-organized and powerful of the militia groups operated under the command of Abdul Rashid Dostum in the area around [[Sheberghan]] in [[Jawzjan province]], northern Afghanistan. Dostum had been in the Army at the time of the 1978 coup, and was a member of the [[Parcham]] faction of the PDPA. 

== Soviet - Afghan war ==

Dostum completed his national service, and had trained as a [[paratrooper]] in the 1970s, as was required by law. Following his demobilization he found employment in the oil fields around [[Sheberghan]] where he was
working at the time of the '''Saur Revolution'''. 

As the government started to arm the staff of the [[petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] refineries—creating “groups for the defense of the revolution” - he was, on the basis of his military training, encouraged to enlist. His group, in response to increasing conflict, was deployed in the rural areas around [[Sheberghan]], under the auspices of the '''Ministry of National Security'''. 

By the mid 1980s his platoon had grown in stature, reaching a company level by at least 1987 and a regimental level, Regiment 734, by 1988. While the unit recruited throughout Jauzjan and had a relatively broad base, many of its early troops and commanders came from Dostum’s home village, Khoja Dukoh, and these represented the core of the unit at that juncture and again when it was reconstituted after 2001.

He left the army after the purge of [[Parcham]]is, and returned after the [[Soviet]] occupation began, commanding a militia battalion that became a regiment and ultimately was incorporated into the defense foces as the '''53rd Infantry Division''', but reporting directly to President [[Mohammad Najibullah]]. He then joined the '''Ministry of State Security''' and became commander of unit 374 in Jozjan. 

He defended the communist [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] against the [[United States]]-backed [[mujahedin]] in the [[1980s]]. Although he was only a regional commander, he had largely raised the militia he fought with on his own.

The Jauzjani militia, as it became known, was one of the few militia forces to be used outside of its region. They were deployed in [[Qandahar]] in 1988 when Soviet forces withdrew. He also supported the [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]]-era Communist reforms in [[Afghanistan]].  

On [[April 18]], [[1992]], he revolted against the government of President [[Najibullah]], allying with [[Ahmed Shah Massoud]]. Together, they captured [[Kabul]], the Afghan [[capital]]. He commanded the principal militia force in [[Kabul]] that ousted Najibullah, creating episodes of [[kidnapping]], [[looting]] and [[fighting]].

== Afghan Civil War ==

In 1994, Dostum again switched sides, allying with forces of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], in once more laying siege on Kabul, this time against the government of [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and Massoud.  

In 1996, following the rise of the [[Taliban]] and their capture of [[Herat]] and [[Kabul]], Dostum realigned himself with Rabbani against the Taliban.  Along with General [[Mohammed Fahim]] and [[Ismail Khan]], Dostum was one of three factional leaders that comprised the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]]. Facing capture and death by Taliban forces, Dostum fled to Iran as an exile.

In 2001, he returned from exile on the heels of a [[United States|U.S.]]-led bombing campaign that drove the Taliban from power.  Since then, he has run parts of the country's north as his own [[fiefdom]], nominally serving as a deputy defense minister in the national government in Kabul but operating almost totally independent of the government.

In November of 2002, the [[United Nations]] began an investigation of alleged [[human rights]] abuses by Dostum. Witnesses claimed that Dostum jailed and tortured witnesses to prevent them from testifying in a war crimes case. Dostum is also under suspicion for the events of the [[Dasht-i-Leili massacre]].

In March 2003, he established a [[North Zone of Afghanistan]], against the wishes of interim president [[Hamid Karzai]].   On [[May 20]], [[2003]], Dostum signed an agreement to no longer serve as  Karzai's special envoy for the northern regions.  Later, Dostum reached a political compromise with Karzai, assuming the position of &quot;Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Afghan Armed Forces&quot;.  

In the aftermath of the Taliban's removal from northern Afghanistan, forces loyal to Dostum frequently clashed with forces loyal to [[Tajiks|Tajik]] General [[Mohammed Atta (Afghan warlord)|Mohammed Atta]]. Through the political mediations of the Karzai regime, the U.S.-led international military Coalition, and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, as well as the UN-run Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration program, the Dostum-Atta feud has largely ended.  The two are now generally politically allied as part of a larger ideological effort to protect the interests of Afghanistan's war veterans and to preserve their own power.

In most ethnic-Uzbek dominated areas in which Dostum has control or influence, he encourages women to live and work freely, as well as music, sports, alcohol, and allows for people of other religions. However it is claimed that during the civil war he financed his army through [[opium]] trading. He has also been accused by people fleeing Afghanistan of being involved in human rights violations: arresting and killing people all over the country through government infrastructure. 

On March 1, 2005 he was appointed chief of staff to the head of the Afghan armed forces, by President [[Hamid Karzai]].

'''Andhra Pradesh''' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]: ఆంధ్ర ప్రదేశ్; ''Āndhra Prādesh''), is a [[States and territories of India|state]] in south-eastern [[India]] and is part of the linguistic-cultural region of [[South India]]. It lies between 12°41' and 22°N latitude and 77° and 84°40'E longitude, and is bounded by [[Maharashtra]], [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Orissa]] in the north, the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the East, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the south and [[Karnataka]] to the west. Andhra Pradesh is the fifth largest state in India and it forms the major link between the north and the south of India. It is the biggest and most populous state in the south of India. It is considered the [[rice]] bowl of India. The state is crisscrossed by two major rivers, the [[Godavari River|Godavari]] and [[Krishna River|Krishna]]. (&quot;Pradesh&quot; means &quot;region&quot; or &quot;state&quot;.)

==Prehistory==
Andhra society is one of the ancient societies of India. One can encounter several tales about Andhras in epics like Mahabharatam and Ramayanam, in great puranas, and Buddhist Jataka Tales. This confirms the ancient nature of Andhra society. The name Andhra is ancient and remained unchanged throughout history. [[Sanskrit]] writings from the [[7th century BCE]] describe the Andhra people as [[Aryan]]s from the north who migrated south of the [[Vindhya Range]] and mixed with [[Dravidian race|Dravidians]].

==History==
[[Image:charminar.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|''Charminar'' or Four [[Minaret]]s in [[Hyderabad]]. Hyderabad was the capital of the Nizam kingdom and later the Nizam dominion.]]

It is only in the [[Mauryan]] age that there is historical evidence of the existence of Andhras as a political power in the southeastern Deccan. [[Megasthenese]], who visited the Court of [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (322-297 BCE), mentioned that Andhra country had 30 fortified towns and an army of a million infantry, 2000 cavalry and 1000 elephants. Buddhist books reveal that Andhras established their kingdoms on the [[Godavari]] belt at that time. [[Asoka]] referred in his [[13th rock edict]] (232 BCE) that Andhra region is under his rule.   

After the fall of the Mauryan Empire, the history of the Andhras, as a continuous account of political and cultural events, commences with the rise of the [[Satavahana]]s as a political power. According to [[Matsya Purana]] there were 29 rulers of this dynasty. They ruled over the Andhradesa including [[Deccan]] for about 400 years from the 2nd century BCE to beyond the 2nd century CE.

The decline and fall of the Satavahana empire left the Andhra country in a political chaos. Local rulers as well as invaders tried to carve out small kingdoms for themselves and to establish dynasties. During the period from 180 to 624 CE, [[Ikshvakus]], [[Brihatphalayanas]], [[Salankayanas]], [[Vishnukundins]], [[Vakatakas]], [[Pallavas]], [[Anandagotras]], [[Kalingas]] and others ruled over the Andhra area with their small kingdoms.  Perhaps most important among these small dynasties were the Ikshvakus. [[Nagarjunakonda]] was their capital and they patronised [[Buddhism]], though they followed the [[vedic]] [[ritualism]]. 

The period of Andhra history, between 624 and 1323, spanning over seven centuries, is significant for the sea-change it brought in all spheres of the human activity; social, religious, linguistic and literary. During this period, [[Desi]], the indigenous [[Telugu]] language, emerged as a literary medium overthrowing the domination of [[Prakrit]] and [[Sanskrit]]. As a result, Andhradesa achieved an identity and a distinction of its own. This change was brought by strong historical forces, namely, the Eastern and Western Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas and the early Cholas.

The [[Eastern Chalukyas]] was a branch of the [[Chalukyas]] of [[Badami]]. [[Pulakesin II]], the renowned ruler of Chalukyas conquered [[Vengi]] (near [[Eluru]]) in 624 CE and installed his brother [[Kubja Vishnuvardhana]] (624-641 CE) as its ruler. His dynasty, known as the Eastern Chalukyas, ruled for nearly four centuries. Vishnuvardhana extended his dominions up to [[Srikakulam]] in the north and [[Nellore]] in the south.

The Eastern Chalukyas occupied a prominent place in the history of Andhra Pradesh. Since the time of [[Gunaga Vijayaditya]], inscriptions show Telugu stanzas, culminating in the production of literary works. Later on, in the 11th century, the great epic [[Mahabharata]] was translated partly by the court poet [[Nannaya]] under the patronage of the then-Eastern Chalukya king [[Rajaraja]]

The 12th century was a period of chaos. The [[Western Chalukyas]] of [[Kalyani]], who were at first successful in overthrowing the Eastern Chalukyas, were driven out after 17 years by the [[Imperial Cholas]] with the help of local chiefs. But the latter did not rule directly and thought it prudent to leave the kingdom to the feudatories themselves in lieu of nominal allegiance. The [[Velanati Cholas]] of [[Tsandavolu]] ([[Guntur]] district) were the foremost among the feudatories. Between 1135 and 1206, several minor dynasties ruled over parts of Andhra Pradesh recognising the authority of the Velanati Cholas nominally. 

The 12th and the 13th centuries saw the emergence of the [[Kakatiyas]]. They were at first the feudatories of the Western Chalukyas of Kalyana, ruling over a small territory near [[Warangal]]. A ruler of this dynasty, [[Prola II]], who ruled from 1110 to 1158, extended his sway to the south and declared his independence. His successor [[Rudra]] (1158-1195) pushed the kingdom to the north up to the [[Godavari delta]]. He built a fort at [[Warangal]] to serve as a second capital and faced the invasions of the [[Yadavas]] of [[Devagiri]]. The next ruler [[Mahadeva]] extended the kingdom to the coastal area. In 1199, [[Ganapati]] succeeded him. He was the greatest of the Kakatiyas and the first after the Satavahanas to bring the entire Telugu area under one rule. He put an end to the rule of the Velanati Cholas in 1210.

The [[Kakatiya]] period was rightly called the brightest period of the Telugu history. The entire Telugu speaking area was under the kings who spoke Telugu and encouraged Telugu. They established order throughout the strife torn land and the forts built by them played a dominant role in the defence of the realm. Kakatiya art preserved the balance between architecture and sculpture, that is, while valuing sculpture, it laid emphasis on architecture where due. The Kakatiya temples, dedicated mostly to [[Siva]], reveal in their construction a blending of the styles of [[North India]] and [[South India]] which influenced the political life of the Deccan.

In 1323, the [[Delhi]] [[Sultan]] [[Ghiaz-ud-din Tughlaq]] sent a large army under [[Ulugh Khan]] to conquer the [[Telugu]] country and lay siege to [[Warangal]]. The disastrous fall of the [[Kakatiya]] capital in 1323 brought the [[Andhras]], for the first time in their history, under the yoke of an alien ruler, the [[Muslim]]s. In 1347, an independent Muslim state, the [[Bahmani]] kingdom, was established in south India by [[Alla-ud-din Hasan Gangu]] in a revolt against the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. By the end of the 15th century, the [[Bahmani]] rule was plagued with faction fights and there came into existence the five [[Shahi]] kingdoms. Of these, it was the [[Qutbshahi]] dynasty that played a significant and notable role in the history of Andhras.

The [[Qutb Shahi]] dynasty held sway over the Andhra country for about two hundred years from the early part of the 16th century to the end of the 17th century. [[Sultan Quli Qutb Shah]], the founder of the dynasty, served the [[Bahmanis]] faithfully and was appointed governor of [[Telangana]] in 1496. He declared independence after the death of his patron king, [[Mahmud Shah]], in 1518. [[Qutb Shahi]] rulers adopted religious tolerance and local customs to a great extent. They treated Hindus equal with Muslims as well and maintained cordial relations between the two throughout. They encouraged the local language Telugu besides the Deccani [[Urdu]]. The socio-cultural life of the people during the rule of the Qutb Shahis was marked by a spirit of broad-mindedness and [[catholicity]] based on sharing and adopting of mutual traditions and customs. The [[Deccani architecture]], is a combination of [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[Hindu]] and [[Pathan]] styles. [[Charminar]], [[citadel]] of [[Hyderabad]], is the most remarkable of all the Qutb Shahi monuments.   

[[Aurangazeb]], the [[Mughal]] emperor, invaded [[Golconda]] in 1687 and annexed it to the Mughal empire. He appointed a [[Nizam]] (governor) and thus for about a period of 35 years this region was ruled by Mughal [[Nizam]]s. Aurangazeb died in 1707 and the administrative machinery of the Mughal imperial regime began to crumble and it gradually lost control over the provinces. It enabled two foreign mercantile companies to consolidate themselves as political powers capable of subsequently playing decisive roles in shaping the destiny of the nation. They were the [[East India Company]] of [[England]] and the [[Compagnie de Inde Orientale]] of [[France]].

===The Colonial Era===
During the [[17th century]], the British acquired the [[Coastal Andhra]] region along the [[Bay of Bengal]], then known as the [[Northern Circars]], from the [[Nizam]]s, which became part of the British [[Madras Presidency]]. The [[Nizam]]s retained control of the interior provinces as the [[princely state]] of [[Hyderabad]], acknowledging British rule in return for local autonomy. 

The provinces were at the time governed in a feudal manner, with [[zamindar]]s in areas such as Kulla and other parts of the Godavari acting as lords under the Nizam. The feudal or zamindari system was removed after independence.

The Andhra (or [[Telugu people|Telugu]]) were at the forefront of Indian nationalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Potti Sriramulu]] fought for independence alongside [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and later fought for Andhra unification.

===Post-Independence===
[[Independence of India|India became independent]] from the [[United Kingdom]] in [[1947]]. The [[Muslim]] [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] wanted to retain his independence from India, but his state was [[History of Hyderabad#The Liberation of Hyderabad|forcibly integrated]] into India in [[1948]] as [[Hyderabad state]]. In 1953, the northern, Telugu-speaking portion of [[Madras State]] voted to become the new state of Andhra Pradesh, the first of India's linguistic states. The state acquired its present boundaries on [[November 1]], [[1956]], when Hyderabad State was partitioned along linguistic lines and its [[Telangana]] region was added to Andhra Pradesh.

==Geography==
===Regions===
Andhra Pradesh can be broadly divided into three regions, namely [[Coastal Andhra]] (Konaseema), [[Telangana]] and [[Rayalaseema]].

[[Coastal Andhra]] occupies the coastal plain between [[Eastern Ghats]] ranges, which run the length of the state, and the [[Bay of Bengal]]. 

[[Telangana]] lies west of the Ghats on the [[Deccan]] plateau. The [[Godavari River|Godavari]] and [[Krishna River|Krishna]] rivers rise in the [[Western Ghats]] of [[Karnataka]] and [[Maharashtra]] and flow east across Telangana to empty into the Bay of Bengal in a combined [[river delta]]. 

[[Rayalaseema]] lies in the southeast of the state on the Deccan plateau, in the basin of the [[Penner River]]. It is separated from Telangana by the low [[Erramala]] hills, and from Coastal Andhra by the Eastern Ghats.

The Krishna and Godavari rivers together irrigate thousands of square kilometres of land, and create the largest perennial cultivable area in the country. Andhra Pradesh leads in the production of [[rice]] ([[paddy]]) and is called India's Rice Bowl.

===Languages in Andhra Pradesh===
[[Telugu language|Telugu]] is the regional and official language of the state, spoken by 84.86% of the population.

==Politics==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:APLegislativeAssembly.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|The [[Andhra Pradesh]] State Legislative Assembly at the center of the [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] City. This white building was originally a [[Nizam]] construction.]] --&gt;

Andhra Pradesh has a [[Legislative Assembly]] of 294 seats. The state has 60 members in the [[Indian national parliament]]: 18 in the [[Rajya Sabha]] (upper house) and 42 in the [[Lok Sabha]] (lower house).

Andhra Pradesh had a row of Congress governments till 1982. Kasu Bramhananda Reddy held the record for the longest serving chief minister which was broken by [[Nara Chandrababu Naidu]]. [[P.V. Narasimha Rao]] also served as the chief minister for the state, who later went on to become the Prime Minister of India. Among the notable chief ministers of the state are Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy, Kasu Bramhananda Reddy, Dr. Marri Chenna Reddy , Kotla Vijaya Bhasker Reddy , [[N T Rama Rao]] and Nara Chandrababu Naidu.

===The Beginning of Multi-Party Politics===
1982 saw the rise of NT Rama Rao (or NTR) as the chief minister of the state for the first time introducing a formidable second political party to Andhra politics and thus breaking the virtually-single party monopoly on Andhra politics. Nadendla Bhaskar Rao attempted a hijack when NTR was away to the United States for a medical treatment. After coming back, NTR successfully convinced the governor to dissolve the Assembly and call for a fresh election. NTR won by a large majority. His government's policies included investment in education and rural development and in holding corrupt government offices accountable.

1989 assembly elections ended the 7-year rule of NTR with the congress being returned to power and Dr. Marri Chenna Reddy at the helm. He was replaced by N. Janardhan Reddy who was in turn replaced by Kotla Vijaya Bhasker Reddy.

In 1994 Assembly saw NTR becoming the chief minister again, but he was soon thrown out of power by his finance minister and son-in-law N Chandrababu Naidu. Naidu won a second term before he was defeated by the Congress-led coalition in the May 2004 polls.

[[Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy]] of the Indian National Congress (INC) is the current chief minister of the states. Rajasekhara Reddy fought the 2004 Assembly elections in an alliance with a new party called Telangana Rashtra Samithi (or TRS), which hopes to form a separate state called Telangana.

==Economy==
[[Image:Map_AP_dist_NH_roads.png|thumb|right|300px|Major road links of Andhra Pradesh]]
===Recent Economic Progress===
In the last decade, the state has emerged at the forefront of India's progress in fields like 

* [[Information Technology]],	
* [[Biotechnology]], 	
* [[Pharmaceuticals]], 
* [[Business Management]], and 
* [[Construction]],
and has emerged as a land of immense business opportunities.

In spite of some liberalization since 1990, Andhra's economy still faces many challeges, especially in the  drought-hit agricultural sector.

Agriculture has been the chief source of income for the state's economy. Two important rivers of India, the [[Godavari]] and [[Krishna]], flow through the state. [[Rice]], [[sugarcane]], [[cotton]], [[Chilli pepper|mirchi]], and [[tobacco]] are the local [[agriculture|crops]]. The state has also started to focus on the fields of [[information technology]] and [[biotechnology]].

===Urban Centers of Economic Importance=== 

[[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], the capital of Andhra Pradesh, is the fifth largest cosmopolitan city in India, rich in culture, enduring history and industrial growth. It is unique in being one of the few cities where tradition and technology co-exist. [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], like [[Bangalore]], has become a center for [[outsourcing]]. Notable amongst the multinational companies in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] are [[Microsoft]], Google, [http://www.rediff.com/money/2004/may/10bpo5.htm Bank of America], Intergraph and Oracle. 

[[Vizag]], Andhra's main port, is home to the Indian Navy's Eastern Naval Command. The city's shipyards, fisheries, docks, and steel works make it an economic powerhouse. Recently, Vizag has seen a rise in investment as industry in Andhra begins to turn towards the lucrative export market. Also, because of its highly valuable geographic location, and because of recent political movement towards a creation of a separate [[Telangana]] state, Vizag has seen a massive rise in investment in the city's real estate market.

==Culture==

Classical dance in Andhra can be performed by both men and women, however women tend to learn it more often.

[[Kuchipudi]] is the state's best-known and widely practiced classical [[dance]] form. 

Another classical dance form, [[Andhra Naatyam]], was historically a dance that defined Andhra's culture. Danced since antiquity at both Buddhist and Hindu temples, it has seen a resurgence in recent years, after nearly dying out.

===Cultural Institutions===
Andhra Pradesh has many museums, including the [[Salar Jung Museum]] in Hyderabad, which features a varied collection of sculptures, paintings, and religious artifacts, and the [http://www.vizagcityonline.com/visakha_museum/ Visakha Museum] in Vizag, which displays the history of the pre-Independence [[Madras Presidency]] in a rehabilitated Dutch bungalow.

==Food==
The cuisine of Andhra Pradesh is reputedly the spiciest of all Indian cuisine. Foods include both the original spicy Andhra cooking and [[Muslim]]-influenced Hyderabadi cuisine.

[[Pickle|Pickles]] and [[chutney|chutneys]] are particularly popular in Andhra Pradesh and many varieties of pickles and chutneys are unique to the state. Chutneys are made from practically every vegetable including  tomatoes, brinjals and an aromatic green called '[[Gongura]]'. A mango pickle, 'Aavakaya', is probably the best known of the Andhra pickles.

Rice is the staple diet and is used in a wide variety of ways. Typically, rice is either boiled and eaten with curry, or made into a batter for use in a [[crepe]]-like dish called [[dosa|dosas]], or rice cakes called [[idli|idlis]]. 

Meat, vegetables and greens are prepared with different masalas into a variety of strongly flavoured dishes. 

Hyderabadi cuisine is influenced by the Muslim population, which arrived in Andhra centuries ago. Much of the cuisine revolves around meat. It is rich and aromatic, with a liberal use of exotic spices and ghee, not to speak of nuts and dry fruits. Lamb, chicken and fish are the most widely used meats in the non-vegetarian dishes. The [[biryani|biryanis]] are perhaps the most distinctive and popular of Hyderabadi dishes.

==Tourism==
[[Image:tirumala.jpg|thumbnail|right|220px|The temple town [[Tirumala]] lit during the night]]
Andhra Pradesh is the home of many religious pilgrim centers. [[Tirupati]], the abode of [[Lord Venkateswara]], has the richest and most visited Hindu temple in India. [[Srisailam]], the abode of ''Sri Mallikarjuna'', is one of the twelve ''[[Jyothirlingam|Jyothirlingams]]'' in India and Yadagirigutta, the abode of an avatara of Vishnu, Sri Lakshmi Narasimha. [[Puttaparthi]] hosts the ashram of popular guru Sri [[Sathya Sai Baba]]. The Ramappa temple at Warangal is famous for some fine temple carvings. The state has numerous Buddhist centers at [[Amaravati]], Bhattiprolu, Nagarjuna Konda, and Phanigiri.

The one-million-year old limestone caves at Borra, picturesque Araku Valley, hill resorts of Horsley Hills, [[Godavari]] racing through a narrow gorge at ''Papi Kondalu'', waterfalls and rich bio-diversity at Talakona, the beaches of Vizag are some of the natural attractions of the state.

[[Charminar]], [[Golconda]] Fort, Chandragiri Fort, and Falaknuma Palace are some of the monuments in the state.

      <comment>/* AGP vs PCI */ remove nonsense about the hard drive, and &quot;tricking&quot; the CPU.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AGP_slot.jpg|right|thumb|400px|AGP slot (maroon), although the color is usually brown.]]
The '''Accelerated Graphics Port''' (also called '''Advanced Graphics Port''') is a high-speed point-to-point channel for attaching a [[graphics card]] to a [[computer]]'s [[motherboard]], primarily to assist in the acceleration of [[3D computer graphics]]. AGP is a type of [[computer bus]]. Some [[motherboard]]s have been built with multiple independent AGP slots.  AGP is slowly being phased out in favour of [[PCI Express]]. 

==Versions of AGP==
[[As of 2004]], newer versions of AGP increase the transfer rate from two to eight times.  Available versions include:
*'''AGP 1x''', using a [[32-bit]] channel operating at 66 [[Megahertz|MHz]] resulting in a maximum data rate of 266 [[megabyte]]s per second (MB/s), doubled from the 133 MB/s transfer rate of [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus 33 MHz / 32-bit; 3.3 V signaling.
*'''AGP 2x''', using a [[32-bit]] channel operating at 66 MHz [[double pumped]] to an effective 133 MHz resulting in a maximum data rate of 533 MB/s; signaling voltages the same as AGP 1x;
*'''AGP 4x''', using a [[32-bit]] channel operating at 66 MHz quad pumped to an effective 266 MHz resulting in a maximum data rate of 1066 MB/s (1 GB/s); 1.5 V signaling;
*'''AGP 8x''', using a [[32-bit]] channel operating at 66 MHz, strobing eight times per clock, delivering an effective 533 MHz resulting in a maximum data rate of 2133 MB/s (2 GB/s); 0.8 V signaling.

In addition, '''AGP Pro''' cards of various types exist.  They require more power and are often longer than standard AGP cards (though they only connect to one AGP slot).  These cards are usually used to accelerate the professional [[computer-aided design]] applications employed in the fields of architecture, machining, engineering, and similar fields.

There are two versions of the AGP physical interface, for 3.3 V and 1.5 V cards respectively. The 1.5 V version has a key further away from the external connector, while the 3.3 V version is the opposite.

*'''64 bit AGP''', using a [[64 bit]] channel. Used in high end professional graphic cards.
*'''AGP Express'''. This is not a true AGP interface, but rather a way to allow an AGP card to be connected over the [[PCI bus]].  It is a technology found on [[Elitegroup Computer Systems|ECS]] motherboards, and is used as a selling point for AGP card owners who want a new motherboard but do not want to be forced to buy a [[PCI Express]] graphics card as well (most new motherboards do not provide AGP slots, only PCI Express slots).  An &quot;AGP Express&quot; slot is basically two PCI slots wired together in the AGP form factor.  While it offers backward compatibility with AGP cards, its disadvantages include [http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWeb/Support/agp.aspx incomplete support] (some AGP cards do not work with AGP Express) and reduced performance (the card is forced to use the shared PCI bus at its lower bandwidth, rather than having exclusive use of the faster AGP bus).

*'''AGI'''. The [[ASRock]] Graphics Interface (AGI) is a proprietary variant of the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) standard. Its purpose is to provide AGP-support for those of Asrock's motherboards that use chipsets lacking native AGP-support. However, it's not fully compatible and several videocard chipsets are known to not be supported. The performace and the quality of that interface is somehow questionable.

==Compatibility==
AGP cards are [[Backward compatibility|backwards]] and [[Forward compatibility|forwards compatible]] within limits. 1.5 V cards will not go into 3.3 V slots and vice versa, though &quot;Universal&quot; slots exist which accept either type of card.  AGP Pro cards (rarely used) will not fit into standard slots, but standard AGP cards will work in a Pro slot.

It should be noted that there are some proprietary exceptions to this rule. For example, [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[Power Macintosh]] computers with the [[Apple Display Connector]] have an extra connector which delivers power to the attached display. Additionally, moving cards between computers of various [[CPU design|architectures]] may not work due to [[firmware]] issues.

==AGP vs PCI==
As computers became increasingly graphically-oriented, the graphics card became far more important than other PCI devices, and, thus, the AGP slot was developed. AGP slots are superior to PCI for graphics cards because they provide a dedicated pathway between the slot and the processor, allowing for faster communication between the two. In addition, AGP uses sideband addressing, meaning that addressing for packets is carried outside of the packet, meaning that the entire packet does not need to be read to get addressing information. In addition, to load a texture, a PCI graphics card must copy it from the system's RAM into the card's framebuffer. An AGP card is capable of reading textures directly from system RAM using the Graphics Address Remapping Table (GART). GART reapportions main memory for texture storage, allowing the graphics card to access them directly.

The two main reasons graphics cards with the PCI interface are produced is that firstly they can be used in nearly any PC, as very few modern desktop PCs do not have PCI slots - though some motherboards with built-in graphics adaptors lack an AGP slot. Secondly, a user with an appropriate [[operating system]] can use several PCI graphics cards (or several PCI graphics cards in combination with one AGP card) simultaneously - to give many different video outputs (for the use of many screens). This cannot be done with AGP cards, as very few (if any) [[motherboard|motherboards]] are equipped with more than one AGP slot.

==Use today==
Although AGP is still incorporated into many motherboards today, it is gradually being phased out by  
[[PCI Express]]. PCI Express allows much faster data transfer and also supports other devices. It is expected that AGP will be gone in the next few years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andreas Aagesen''' ([[1826]] &amp;ndash; [[1879]]) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] jurist.

He was educated for the law at Christiania (now [[Oslo]]) and [[Copenhagen]], and interrupted his studies in 1848 to take part in the first [[Schleswig]] war, in which he served as the leader of a reserve battalion. In 1855 he became professor of [[jurisprudence]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In 1870 he was appointed a member of the commission  for drawing up a maritime and commercial code, and the navigation  law of 1882 is mainly his work. In 1879 he was elected a member  of the [[Landsting]] (Upper House of the Danish Parliament); but it is as a teacher at the university that he won his reputation. Among his numerous juridical works may be mentioned: ''Bidrag til Læren om Overdragelse af Ejendomsret, Bemærkinger om Rettigheder over Ting'' 
(Copenhagen, 1866, 1871-1872); ''Fortegnelse over Retssamlinger, Retslitteratur i Danmark, Norge, Sverige'' (Copenhagen, 1876). Aagesen was [[Carl Christian Hall]]'s successor as lecturer on [[Roman law]] at the university, and in this department his researches were epoch-making. All his pupils were profoundly impressed by his examination of the sources, his demonstration of his subject and his search after truth. 

See C. F. Bricka, ''Dansk Biog. Lex.'' vol. i. (Copenhagen, [[1887]]); ''Samlede Skrifter,'' edited by F. C. Bornemann (Copenhagen, [[1883]]).

'''Aalen''' is a [[town]] in the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Baden-Württemberg]]. It is the seat of the [[Ostalbkreis]] district.

Aalen is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with [[Saint-Lô]], [[France]], [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], [[England]], [[Tatabanya|Tatabánya]], [[Hungary]] and [[Antakya]], [[Turkey]].

==Geography==

Aalen is situated on the river [[Kocher]], at the foot of the [[Swabian Alb]] to the south and south east and close to the hilly landscape of the [[Ellwanger Berge]] to the north. Aalen is at about 70 kilometres east of [[Stuttgart]] and 50 kilometres north of [[Ulm]].

==History==
From about 150/160 [[Anno Domini|AD]] a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fort housed the equestrian unit ''Ala II Flavia miliaria'' at the site of present-day Aalen. The location was strategically important at the time, in the direct vicinity of the [[Germanic Limes|Rhaetian Limes]]. It has been suggested that the name of Aalen traces back to the Roman fort, but this was disproved by later research. Today's town of Aalen did not emerge until more than a millennium later.

Aalen was probably founded in the [[13th century]], though it is not certain whether by the [[Staufian]]s or by the counts of [[Oettingen]]. It was first mentioned in written records in the 14th century when it was subject to the counts of Oettingen. Aalen was an [[Imperial City]] (often misreferred to as [[Imperial Free City]]) from [[1360]] to [[1802]], when it was annexed to [[Württemberg]]. It then became the seat of an [[Oberamt]] from which the district (''Kreis'') Aalen emerged in 1938. The latter merged with the district of [[Schwäbisch Gmünd]] to the newly formed [[Ostalbkreis]] in 1973, though Aalen remained the district seat.

==Economy and transport==

In the early [[20th century]] the population was 10,000. Woolen and linen goods were manufactured, and there were ribbon looms and tanneries in the town, and large iron works in the neighbourhood. The economy of Aalen is today dominated by metal processing. Besides machine construction, the optical sector plays an important role, as well as the textile and paper industries. There are several [[Microbrew|micro-breweries]], of which the one in Wasseralfingen is the most popular. Their beer is called ''Wasseralfinger''.

Aalen is a health resort, with hot springs and an old mine which now offers therapy for asthma illnesses. A mine railway takes visitors deep into the Braunenberg mountain, where once ore was mined for the iron works, but now is in use for the above-mentioned asthma therapy.

Aalen has several sports teams; its wrestling team is one of the top clubs in all of Germany.

Aalen is located directly on the [[Autobahn]] A7 and is also well connected to the network of federal roads (''Bundesstraßen''). It is a regional railway hub, with frequent service to [[Stuttgart]] Hbf, [[Nürnberg]] Hbf and [[Ulm]] Hbf.  Interregional trains run directly as far as [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Dresden]]. The local bus system is of high quality; its [[double-decker bus|double-decker buses]] are among the few extant outside England.

==Boroughs of Aalen==

* Dewangen
* Ebnat
* Fachsenfeld
* Hofen
* Unterkochen
* Waldhausen
* Wasseralfingen.

'''Aloysius &quot;Alois&quot; Alzheimer''' (b. [[June 14]] [[1864]] in [[Marktbreit]], [[Bavaria]]; d. [[December 19]] [[1915]] in Breslau, now [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[neuropathologist]] and a colleague of [[Emil Kraepelin]] who first identified the symptoms of what is now known as [[Alzheimer's Disease]].  He observed the disease in a patient he first saw in [[1901]], and published his findings from his postmortem examination of her brain in [[1906]]. His father served in the office of notary public in the family's hometown. Alzheimer attended [[Aschaffenburg]], [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[Berlin]], and [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] universities. He received a medical degree at Würzburg University in [[1887]]. In the following year, he spent five months assisting mentally ill women, before he took an office in the city mental asylum in [[Frankfurt am Main]]: the Städtische Anstalt für Irre und Epileptische (asylum for lunatics and epileptics). [[Emil Sioli]] was the dean of that asylum ([[1852]]-[[1922]]). Another neurologist, [[Franz Nissl]] ([[1860]]-[[1919]]), began to work in that same asylum with Alzheimer, and they knew each other. Much of Alzheimer's later work on brain pathology made use of Nissl's method of silver staining of the histological sections. Alzheimer was the co-founder and co-publisher of the journal ''Zeitschrift für die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie''. He never wrote a book that he could call his own. He fell ill on the train on the way to the University of Breslau where he had been appointed professor of psychiatry in [[1912]]. Most probably he had a [[streptococcal]] infection and subsequent [[rheumatic fever]] and [[kidney failure]]. He died of [[heart failure]] at the age of 51, in Breslau.

'''Aedile''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] '''''Aedilis''''', from ''aedes, aedis'' &quot;temple,&quot; &quot;building&quot;) was an office of the [[Roman Republic]].  Based in [[Rome]], the aediles were responsible for maintenance of public buildings and regulation of public [[festival]]s.  They also had powers to enforce public order. Half of the aediles were from the ranks of [[plebeian]]s and half were [[patrician]]s. The latter were called ''curule aediles'' (''aediles curules'') and they were considered [[Magistratus Curulis|curule magistrates]].

The office was generally held by young men intending to follow the ''[[cursus honorum]]'' to high political office.  However it was not a legal part of the cursus, merely an advantageous starting point which demonstrated the aspiring politician's commitment to public service.

They were created in the same year as the [[Tribune|tribunes of the people]] (494 B.C.). Originally intended as assistants to the tribunes, they exercised certain police functions, were 
empowered to inflict fines and managed the plebeian and Roman games.  According to [[Livy]] (vi. 42), after the passing of the [[Licinian rogation]]s, an extra day was added to the Roman 
games; the aediles refused to bear the additional expense, whereupon the patricians offered to undertake it, on condition that they were admitted to the aedileship.  The plebeians 
accepted the offer, and accordingly two ''curule'' aediles were appointed--at first from the patricians alone, then from patricians and plebeians in turn, lastly, from either--at the 
Comitia Tributa under the presidency of the consul.  Although not sacrosanct, they had the right of sitting in a curule chair and wore the distinctive toga praetexta.  They took over 
the management of the [[ludi Romani|Roman]] and [[ludi Megalenses|Megalesian]] games, the care of the patrician temples and had the right of issuing edicts as superintendents of the markets.  But although the curule 
aediles always ranked higher than the plebeian, their functions gradually approximated and became practically identical. 

[[Cicero]] (Legg. iii. 3, 7) divides these functions under three heads:--(1) Care of the city: the repair and preservation of temples, sewers and aqueducts; street cleansing and paving; 
regulations regarding traffic, dangerous animals and dilapidated buildings; precautions against fire; superintendence of baths and taverns; enforcement of sumptuary laws; punishment of gamblers and usurers; the care of public morals generally, including the prevention of foreign superstitions.  They also punished those who had too large a share of the ager publicus, or kept too many cattle on the state pastures. (2) Care of provisions: 
investigation of the quality of the articles supplied and the 
correctness of weights and measures; the purchase of corn for 
disposal at a low price in case of necessity. (3) Care of 
line games: superintendence and organization of the public 
games, as well as of those given by themselves and private 
individuals (e.g. at funerals) at their own expense.  
Ambitious persons often spent enormous sums in this manner to 
win the popular favor with a view to official advancement. 

In [[44 B.C.]] [[Julius Caesar]] added two patrician aediles, called ''Cereales'', whose special duty was the care of the corn-supply.  
Under [[Augustus]] the office lost much of its importance, its juridical functions and the care of the games being transferred to the praetor, while its city responsibilities were limited by the appointment of a [[Prefect|praefectus urbi]]. In the 3rd century A.D. it disappeared altogether.

'''American Airlines''' is the largest [[airline]] in the world in terms of total passengers transported, and the second-largest airline in the world (behind [[Air France-KLM]]) in terms of total operating revenues. A subsidiary of the [[AMR Corporation]], the airline is headquartered in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], adjacent to the [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]]. American operates scheduled flights throughout the [[United States]], as well as flights to [[Canada]], [[Latin America]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Western Europe]], [[Japan]] and [[India]]. The [[chairman]] and [[CEO]] of AA is [[Gerard Arpey]]. In 2005 the airline netted over 98 million [[Revenue passenger mile|RPMs]].

As of February 2006, American serves 171 cities with a fleet of 707  aircraft. American carries more passengers between the US and Latin America (12.1 million in 2004) than any other airline, and is also strong in the transcontinental market.

American has seven hubs: [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Lambert-Saint Louis International Airport|St. Louis]], [[Logan International Airport|Boston]], [[LaGuardia Airport|LaGuardia]], and [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York JFK]]. [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]] is the airline's largest hub, with AA operating over 84 percent of flights at the airport and traveling to more destinations than from any of its other hubs. [[Los Angeles International Airport]] and [[Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport|San Juan]] serve as a focus cities and international gateways.  American operates maintenance bases at [[Tulsa International Airport|Tulsa]], [[Kansas City International Airport|Kansas City]], and [[Fort Worth Alliance Airport|Fort Worth Alliance]].

[[American Eagle Airlines]] is an airline based in Fort Worth, Texas, USA. It is a regional airline partner of American Airlines (both are wholly owned by AMR Corporation).

American is a founding member of the [[Oneworld (airlines)|oneworld]] [[airline alliance]].

== History ==
===Formation===
American Airlines developed from a conglomeration of about 82 small airlines through a series of corporate acquisitions and reorganizations: initially, the name '''American Airways''' was used as a common brand by a number of independent air carriers. These included Southern Air Transport in Texas, Southern Air Fast Express (SAFE) in the western US, Universal Aviation in the Midwest (which operated a transcontinental air/rail route in 1929), and Colonial Air Transport in the Northeast.

On [[January 25]], [[1930]], American Airways was incorporated as a single company, with routes from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Chicago, Illinois]] to [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], and a transcontinental route from Dallas to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. The airline operated its routes with all-metal [[Fokker Trimotor]]s and [[Ford Trimotor]]s. In 1934 American began flying [[Curtiss Condor]] biplanes fitted with sleeping berths.

===American Airlines before World War II===
In 1934, American Airways Company, in financial straits, was acquired by [[E.L. Cord]], who renamed the company &quot;American Airlines&quot;. Cord hired Texas businessman [[C. R. Smith|C.R. (Cyrus Rowlett) Smith]] to run the company. Early in its history, the company was headquartered at [[Midway Airport]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. American's innovations during this period included the introduction of [[flight attendant]]s.
[[Image:American DC-3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|American played a major role in the development of the [[Douglas DC-3]], dubbed &quot;Flagship&quot; in the American fleet]]
Smith worked closely with [[Donald Douglas]] to develop the [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]], which American Airlines started flying in 1936. With the DC-3, American began to brand itself using nautical terms, calling its aircraft &quot;Flagships&quot; and establishing the &quot;Admirals Club,&quot; an honorary club for valued passengers. The DC-3s had a four-star &quot;admiral's pennant&quot; which would fly outside the cockpit window while the aircraft was parked, one of the most well-known images of the airline at the time.

American was the first airline to cooperate with [[Fiorello LaGuardia]]'s plans to build an airport in [[New York City]], and partly as a result became the owner of the world's first [[Airport lounge|airline lounge]] at the new [[LaGuardia Airport]], which became known as the &quot;[[Admirals Club]].&quot; Membership was initially by invitation only, but a discrimination suit decades later changed the club into a paid membership club, creating the model for other airline lounges.

===Postwar developments===
After [[World War II]], American launched an international subsidiary, [[American Overseas Airways]] to serve [[Europe]]; however, AOA was sold to rival [[Pan Am]] in 1948. AA launched another subsidiary around the same time, American Airlines de Mexico S.A., to operate flights to [[Mexico]], and built several airports in northern Mexico to serve as diversion points for aircraft bound for [[Mexico City]].

American Airlines introduced the first transcontinental jet service on [[25 January]] [[1959]]. With the introduction of [[Boeing 707|707]] &quot;Astrojet&quot; service in the 1960s, American's focus shifted to nonstop coast-to-coast flights, although it maintained feeder connections to other cities along its old route using smaller [[Convair 990]]s and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra|Lockheed Electras]]. The company also launched the first electronic booking system, named [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], together with [[IBM]].

During the 1970s, American acquired its first [[Boeing 747]]s; depressed passenger numbers at the time led American to fit many of its 747s with [[Wurlitzer]] [[piano]]s in the main cabin. Following the [[Transpacific Route Case]], AA began 747 flights to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], although it traded these routes to [[Pan Am]] in 1975 in exchange for routes to the Caribbean. The 747s were soon moved to cargo service, and replaced in passenger service with [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]s.

Following a financial slump in the 1970s under the leadership of former [[General Counsel|general counsel]] [[George Spater]], American hired seasoned manager [[Albert Casey]]. Casey decided to move American's corporate headquarters from [[New York City]] to [[Fort Worth, Texas]] in 1979. American opened a new corporate campus on the site of the closed [[Greater Southwest International Airport]], just south of the new [[Dallas Fort Worth International Airport]].

On C.R. Smith's advice, American also hired a young finance executive, [[Robert Crandall]], who had previously worked for [[Bloomingdale's]] and [[TWA]]. Crandall introduced, among other innovations, the world's first frequent flyer miles (AAdvantage) and corporate travel card (AAirpass). After discovering several thousand unused [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] terminals in a Tulsa hangar, Crandall ordered them refurbished and provided to [[travel agent]]s, creating the first airline-owned agent-accessible [[computer reservations system]].  Crandall was named American's President in 1980, and succeeded [[Albert Casey]] as CEO and Chairman in 1985.

===Expansion in 1980s and 1990s===
[[image:americanairlines.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|250px|In the 1990s, American switched to an all-twinjet fleet. [[Boeing 767]] aircraft replaced older [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]]s on many transatlantic routes]]
American changed its routing to a [[spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke system]] starting in 1981, opening its first hubs at DFW and Chicago O'Hare. American began flights to [[Europe]] and [[Japan]] from these hubs in the mid-1980s.

In the late 1980s, American opened three new hubs for north-south traffic. [[Norman Y. Mineta San José International Airport|San Jose International Airport]] was added as a hub after American purchased [[Air California]]. American also built a new terminal and runway at [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport]] to take advantage of the rapidly-growing [[Research Triangle Park]] nearby, as well as compete with USAir's hub in [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]]. [[Nashville International Airport|Nashville]] was also chosen as a hub. 

Lower fuel prices in the era and a favorable management climate at the time led to higher than average airline industry profits that were not necessarily shared by non-stockholding employees.  The industry's expansion was not lost on the American Airline's existing employees who on [[February 17]], [[1997]] struck for higher wages.  President [[Bill Clinton]] invoked the Taft-Hartley Amendment to the [[Wagner Act]] citing economic impact to the United States a few minutes later quashing the strike.[http://www.iht.com/articles/1997/02/17/fly.t_1.php]  Pilots settled for substantially lower wage increases than their demands as a result. 

The three new hubs were all abandoned in the 1990s: San Jose was sold to [[Reno Air]], and RDU to [[Midway Airlines]]. Midway went out of business in 2001. American purchased Reno Air in February 1999 and fully integrated its operations on [[31 August]] [[1999]], but did not resume hub operations in San Jose.

[[Miami International Airport|Miami]] also became a hub after American bought Central and South American routes from [[Eastern Airlines]] in 1990. Through the 1990s, American expanded its route network in Latin America to become the dominant U.S. carrier in the region.

On [[15 October]] [[1998]] American Airlines became the first airline to offer electronic ticketing in all 44 countries it serves.

===TWA merger, 9/11, and aftermath===
[[image:american.b777-200er.n780an.arp.jpg|thumb|250px|American Airlines Boeing 777-200ER landing]]
Crandall left the company in 1998 and was replaced by [[Donald J. Carty]], who negotiated the purchase of [[Trans World Airlines]] and its hub in St. Louis in April 2001.

The merger of the different labor unions was a contentious issue. The TWA pilots belonged to the [[Air Line Pilots Association]] ([[ALPA]]) and the American Airlines pilots belonged to the [[Allied Pilots Association (APA)]]. The pilots of the APA took a position that the TWA pilots could not get something for nothing. Namely, job security and retirement benefits without giving up something -- seniority. The ALPA pilots felt they deserved a more fair distribution within the APA seniority list.

As a result, 60 percent of all former TWA pilots were moved to the bottom of the seniority list at American Airlines. For example, the senior-most former TWA captain, hired in 1963 was integrated at the same seniority level as a 1985-hire American captain. To keep some relative seniority, the TWA pilots were given &quot;super-seniority&quot; and a specified ratio of captain's jobs (relative to other domiciles) if they stayed within the St. Louis pilot domicile. If they decided to leave the St. Louis pilot domicile, they would have to compete for jobs on the basis of their integrated seniority number. The result was that most former TWA pilots stayed in the St. Louis domicile and roughly maintained their same relative seniority; albeit stuck within the St. Louis domicile. A few former TWA pilots flew in the co-pilot seat next to AA pilots with significantly less seniority and experience when they decided to transfer to one of the other American Airlines pilot domiciles.

Of the appoximately 2300 TWA pilots who were integrated, approximately 400 were slated for mandatory retirement before the integration actually took place.

As of [[July 2]], [[2003]], 100% of all former TWA flight attendants were furloughed by American Airlines (approximately 4,200 employees). This was due to the American Airlines flight attendant union putting all the former TWA flight attendants at the bottom of their seniority list.

In the wake of the TWA merger and the roughly concurrent [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] (which claimed two of AA's aircraft), American began losing money. Carty negotiated new wage and benefit agreements with the airline's labor unions, but was forced to resign after union leaders discovered that Carty was planning to award handsome executive compensation packages at the same time.  St. Louis' hub was also downsized afterwards.
[[image:AA bird logo.svg|thumb|right|100px|Logo as pictured on their tail fin and when referring to the website aa.com]]
In Carty's wake, American has undergone additional cost-cutting measures, including rolling back its &quot;More Room in Coach&quot; program (which eliminated several seats on certain aircraft types), ending three-class service on many international flights, and standardizing its fleet at each hub (see below). However, the airline has rebounded and expanded its service into new markets, including [[Ireland]], western [[Japan]], and [[India]].  American Airlines is also expanding to [[China]] in [[2006]].

On [[July 20]], [[2005]], for the first time in 17 quarters, American announced a quarterly profit; the airline earned $58 million in Q2 2005. American is reliant upon its dominant position at Dallas/Fort Worth for its continuing financial solvency, and is lobbying for the preservation of the [[Wright Amendment]], which regulates [[Southwest Airlines]]' operations at [[Love Field]] in Dallas.

==Codesharing agreements==
American currently has [[Code sharing|codesharing]] agreements with [[Aer Lingus]], [[Air Pacific]], [[Air Sahara]], [[Alaska Airlines]], [[British Airways]], [[Cathay Pacific Airways]], [[China Eastern Airlines]], [[Deutsche Bahn]] ([[AiRail Service]]), [[EVA Air]], [[Finnair]], [[TACA (airline)|Grupo TACA]], [[Gulf Air]], [[Hawaiian Airlines]], [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]], [[Japan Airlines]], [[LAN (airline)|LAN Airlines]], [[Mexicana]], [[Qantas Airways]], [[SN Brussels Airlines]], [[SNCF]], [[Swiss International Air Lines]], [[TAM Linhas Aéreas|TAM Airlines]], [[Turkish Airlines]] and [[Vietnam Airlines]]. [[AmericanConnection]], which feeds American's hub at [[Lambert Saint Louis International Airport]], is also a codesharing operation with three regional carriers.

===New services/Future destinations===
American Airlines has begun to expand its network internationally, especially [[Asia]]. Major hubs such as [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] and [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport]] are constantly introduced to new destinations.

Nonstop services from [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare]] to
*[[Shanghai]] ([[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]]), [[China]] (starting [[April 3]], [[2006]])

==Incidents and Accidents ==

* [[American Airlines Flight 587]], an [[Airbus A300]] crashed in [[New York City]] on [[November 12]], [[2001]].
* American almost lost [[American Airlines Flight 63|Flight 63]] to &quot;shoe bomber&quot; [[Richard Reid (terrorist)|Richard Reid]] on [[December 22]] of the same year, but the plot was foiled.  The flight was en route from [[Charles De Gaulle International Airport|Paris Charles De Gaulle]] to [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], and was diverted to Boston's [[Logan International Airport|Logan Airport]].
*A passenger on [[American Airlines Flight 924]] who officials said claimed to have a bomb in a carry-on bag was shot and killed by a team of federal [[Federal Air Marshal Service|air marshals]] on a jetway as the plane boarded at [[Miami International Airport]] for a flight to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]] on [[December 7]], [[2005]].

== Fleet ==
American operates a relatively young fleet, with an average age of 10.5 years [http://www.airsafe.com/events/airlines/fleetage.htm]. Almost half of its fleet is comprised of [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9#MD-80 series|MD-82]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9#MD-80 series|MD-83]] series twinjets, referred to by AA as &quot;Super 80,&quot; denoting the type's original name, &quot;DC-9 Super 80.&quot;  Much of the Super 80 fleet dates back to the early 1980s, although they own some newer examples acquired from TWA. Regardless of age, most of AA's aircraft have been refitted with new interiors in the last few years, with the exception of many [[Boeing 757]]s. AA has also introduced  new aircraft to its fleet: the newest are the [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes|Boeing]] [[Boeing 777|777-200ER]]s, which replaced [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]]s on key transoceanic routes in the late 1990s such as Tokyo Narita, and [[Boeing 737|737-800]]s, which replaced [[Boeing 727|727]]s and the [[BAC-111]]s on some domestic and Caribbean routes.

American has discontinued three-class service on most aircraft, but continues to offer business class on 777 and 767-200 aircraft. First class passengers on 777 routes to London and Frankfurt enjoy the &quot;American Flagship Suite,&quot; a first class seat that can swivel inwards toward a personal work area and also recline 90 degrees to become a bed. 767-200 flights between [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK]], [[San Francisco International Airport|SFO]], and [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] offer three-class &quot;American Flagship Service&quot; which replicates the passenger service offered on long international flights.

[[Image:IMG 1265r.jpg|thumb|250px|An American Airbus A300 inbound to JFK.]]

On all American aircraft (except ex-TWA 757s), passengers in all cabins have a cigarette port DC power port at select seats. All classes of service on the 777-223ER have personal video screens, although they lack Audio/Video On Demand (AVOD) systems. These personal video screens offer GateConnect, a feature which allows passengers to view maps of the destination airports (gates, security checkpoints, baggage claims, etc) and find out information on connecting flights from that same airport such as gate, aircraft, etc.

Most recently, American has taken the unique step of redesigning its schedules so that each hub city receives certain aircraft types more often than others, which is intended to simplify maintenance and last-minute fleet substitutions. Currently, Chicago, DFW and St. Louis get most Boeing MD-80(S80), 757-2Q8, and 757-231 service, Miami gets most 757-223 and 737 service, and JFK gets most A300 and 767-200 service.  [[Boeing 777|777-223ER]]'s and [[Boeing 767|767-323ER]]'s are usually reserved for high density domestic markets and international flights.

American Airlines was one of three carriers ([[Continental Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]] being the other two) to sign an exclusivity agreement with Boeing in the late 1990s. When Boeing acquired [[McDonnell Douglas]], the [[European Union]] forced Boeing to void the contracts. However, both parties have been adhering to and intend to adhere to the terms under a [[gentlemen's agreement]].

== Livery ==
American's early [[livery|liveries]] varied widely, but a common livery was adopted in the 1930s that featured a large [[eagle]] painted on the fuselage of each aircraft. The eagle became a widely-recognized symbol of the company and inspired the name of [[American Eagle Airlines]]. Propeller aircraft featured an [[international orange]] lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage, which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets.

In the late 1960s, American commissioned an industrial designer to develop a new livery. The original design called for a red, white, and blue stripe on the fuselage, and a simple &quot;AA&quot; logo, without an eagle, on the tail. However, American's employees revolted when the livery was made public, and launched a &quot;Save the Eagle&quot; campaign similar to the &quot;Save the Flying Red Horse&quot; campaign at [[Mobil]]. Eventually, the designer caved in and created a highly stylized eagle, dubbed &quot;the bug,&quot; which remains the company's logo to this day. In 1999, American painted a new [[Boeing 757]] in its 1959 international orange livery.

American is the only major U.S. airline that leaves the majority of its aircraft surfaces unpainted. Originally, this was because C. R. Smith hated painted aircraft, and refused to use any liveries that involved painting the entire plane. Crandall later justified the bare-metal design by noting that less paint reduced the aircraft's weight, thus saving on fuel costs. [[Eastern Airlines]] and [[USAir]] have also maintained unpainted airplanes in the past.

==Miscellaneous==
*In the 1960s, [[Mattel]] released a series of ''American Airlines stewardess'' [[Barbie]] dolls.
*An American Airlines Space Freighter, the ''Valley Forge'', was the setting for the 1971 [[science fiction]] movie [[Silent Running]], starring [[Bruce Dern]] and directed by [[Douglas Trumbull]].
*AA was featured prominently in the first two ''[[Home Alone]]'' movies.
*In the early 1990s, singer [[Janet Jackson]] made a commercial for AA.
*AA has been a long-time promotional sponsor of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', broadcast from AA's hub city of Chicago.
*AA is one of the few companies to have purchased [[naming rights]] for two sporting venues: the [[American Airlines Arena]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] and the [[American Airlines Center]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]].
*AA was the first airline to offer [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]] cocktails on its aircraft. The airline's contract with the garage-based makers of &quot;Mr. and Mrs. T&quot; mix eventually exhausted the small factory's supply and forced Mr. and Mrs. T to sell itself to [[Del Monte]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''antidepressant''' is a [[medication]] designed to treat or alleviate the symptoms of [[clinical depression]]. Some antidepressants, notably the [[tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclics]], are commonly used [[off-label use|off-label]] in the treatment of [[neuropathy|neuropathic pain]], whether or not the patient is depressed. Smaller doses are generally used for this purpose, and they often take effect more quickly. Many antidepressants also are used for the treatment of [[anxiety disorder]]s, and tricyclic antidepressants are used in the treatment of [[chronic pain]] disorders such as [[chronic functional abdominal pain]] (CFAP), [[myofascial pain syndrome]], and [[post-herpetic neuralgia]].

The main classes of antidepressants have similar efficacy, but the newer types are generally regarded to have a more benign side-effect profile and less risk of lethality if taken in overdose.

== History ==
Like many psychiatric drugs, antidepressants were discovered by accident. The first usefull antidepressants, belonged to a group called Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and were discovered in the early 1950's. The original member of this group was Iproniazid. It was originally developed as a drug to treat tuberculosis. The next group were the Tricyclic antidepressants. The first was Imipramine. They were effective and safer than the MAOI but still quite dangerous in overdose. They are still used to-day but have been largely replaced by another group. This most recent group are called SSRI's, '''S'''elective '''S'''erotonin '''R'''euptake '''I'''nhibitors. The first SSRI was fluoxetine (Prozac). Drugs from all three groups have been found to improve the depressed patients' mood. 
The SSRI antidepressants were early examples of [[rational drug design]].

Well-known antidepressants are:
* [[Fluoxetine]] - of the [[SSRI]] class (Prozac, Sarafem, Fluctin, Fontex, Prodep, Fludep, Lovan)
* [[Sertraline]] - of the [[SSRI]] class (Zoloft, Lustral, Apo-Sertral, Asentra, Gladem, Serlift, Stimuloton)
* [[Venlafaxine]] - of the [[SNRI]] class (Effexor)
* [[Citalopram]] - of the [[SSRI]] class (Celexa, Cipramil, Talohexane)
* [[Paroxetine]] - of the [[SSRI]] class (Paxil, Seroxat, Aropax)
* [[Escitalopram]] - of the [[SSRI]] class (Lexapro, Cipralex)
* [[Fluvoxamine]] - of the [[SSRI]] class (Luvox, Faverin)
* [[Duloxetine]] - of the [[SNRI]] class (Cymbalta)
* [[Bupropion]] - of the [[DRI]] class (Wellbutrin, Zyban)

==Mechanism of action==
The therapeutic effects of antidepressants are believed to be related to an effect on [[neurotransmitter]]s, particularly by inhibiting the [[monoamine transporter]] proteins of [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]]. [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) specifically prevent the reuptake of serotonin (thereby increasing the level of serotonin in [[synapse|synapses]] of the [[brain]]), whereas earlier [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) blocked the destruction of neurotransmitters by [[enzyme]]s which normally break them down. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) prevent the reuptake of various [[neurotransmitters]], including [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]]. Although these drugs are clearly effective in treating depression, the current theory still leaves unanswered questions. For example, concentrations in the [[blood]] build to therapeutic levels in only a few days and begin affecting neurotransmitter activity immediately. Changes in mood, however, often take four weeks or more to appear. One explanation holds that the &quot;down-regulation&quot; of neurotransmitter [[Transmembrane receptor|receptors]]&amp;mdash;an apparent consequence of excess signaling and a process that takes several weeks&amp;mdash;is actually the mechanism responsible for the alleviation of depressive symptoms. Another theory, based on recent research published by the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the [[United States]], suggests that antidepressants may derive their effects by promoting [[neurogenesis]] in the [[hippocampus]].[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11124987&amp;query_hl=4][http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11137860&amp;query_hl=2]. Recent research suggests that antidepressants act on transcription factors termed &quot;clock genes&quot; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15994025&amp;query_hl=24], which also are involved in actions of drugs of abuse and possibly in obesity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16094306&amp;query_hl=27][http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16288309&amp;query_hl=24].

==Treatment strategies==
On efficacy measures, a successful antidepressant trial involves just 50 % or more of the test subjects on the drug responding to the medication. “Response” signifies a mere 50 % or greater reduction in depression symptoms as opposed to “remission,” which indicates a virtual elimination of depression symptoms. A number of different treatment strategies, however, may produce better results:

===Switching===
The [[American Psychiatric Association]] 2000 Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Major Depressive Disorder advises that where no response is achieved following six to eight weeks of treatment with an antidepressant to switch to an antidepressant in the same class, then to a different class of antidepressant.

A series of open-label studies by Michael Thase MD of the University of Pittsburgh found that more than half the patients who failed on their initial antidepressant achieved a response on their second antidepressant from the same class. (Thase ME et al. &quot;Fluoxetine treatment of patients with major depressive disorder who failed initial treatment with sertraline.&quot; J Clin Psychiatry. 1997 Jan;58(1):16-21.)

A 2002 double-blind study by the same author found a positive benefit among treatment-resistant patients switching either from an SSRI to a tricyclic or from a tricyclic to an SSRI. (Thase ME et al. &quot;Double-blind switch study of imipramine or sertraline treatment of antidepressant-resistant chronic depression.&quot; Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2002 Mar;59(3):233-9.)

===Augmentation and combination===
For a partial response, the American Psychiatric Association advises augmenting an antidepressant with a different pharmaceutical agent. These agents may include [[lithium]], thyroid supplementation, atypical [[antipsychotics]], and dopamine agonists, among others. [[Symbyax]] a combination olanzapine-fluoxetine (Zyprexa-Prozac) pill is approved in the US for treating bipolar depression, and is being investigated for other depression indications. In general, however, there are no major augmentation studies to guide psychiatrists.

Combination strategy involves using two or more antidepressants from different classes to target more than one neurotransmitter in order to hopefully achieve a more beneficial result. Again, this is a little-studied area of antidepressant treatment. (See [http://www.mcmanweb.com/article-180.htm  article].)

===Combining with psychotherapy===
A 2000 study  found that those on nefazadone (Serzone) plus a form of short-term psychotherapy called Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) fared significantly better (85 % response, 42 % remission) than those on Serzone alone (55 % response, 22 % remission) or CBASP alone (52 % response, 24 % remission). (Keller MB et al. &quot;A comparison of nefazadone, the cognitive behavioral-analysis system of psychotherapy, and their combination for the treatment of chronic depression.&quot; N Engl J Med. 2000 May 18;342(20):1462-70.)

===Preventing relapse===
A 2003 meta-analysis of 31 placebo-controlled antidepressant trials found that continuing with antidepressants reduced the risk of relapse by 70 %. (Geddes JR et al. &quot;Relapse prevention with antidepressant drug treatment in depressive disorders: a systematic review.&quot; Lancet. 2003 Feb 22;361(9358):653-61.)

The American Psychiatric Association advises four to five months of continuation treatment on an antidepressant following the resolution of symptoms. For patients with a history of depressive episodes, the British Association for Psychopharmacology's 2000 Evidence Based Guidelines for Treating Depressive Disorders with Antidepressants advises remaining on an antidepressant for at least six months and as long as five years or indefinitely.

==Tolerance and dependence==
Antidepressants are not thought to produce [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], although sudden [[withdrawal]] may produce adverse effects. Antidepressants create little if any immediate change in mood and require between several days and several weeks to take effect.

Antidepressants do not seem to have all of the same [[addiction|addictive]] qualities as other substances such as nicotine, caffeine, cocaine, or other [[stimulant]]s. (There is, however, controversy on the definition of ''addiction''.) Some argue that antidepressants do not meet the general requirements for the commonly-established view. While some antidepressants may cause dependence and withdrawal they do not seem to cause uncontrollable urges to increase the dose due to euphoria or pleasure. For example, if an [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] medication is suddenly discontinued, it may produce both [[withdrawal|somatic]] and [[addiction|psychological withdrawal]] symptoms, a phenomenon known as &quot;SSRI discontinuation syndrome&quot; (Tamam &amp; Ozpoyraz, 2002). When the decision is made to stop taking antidepressants it is common practice to &amp;#8220;wean&amp;#8221; off of them by slowly decreasing the dose over a period of several weeks.

It is generally not a good idea to take antidepressants without a prescription. The selection of an antidepressant and dosage suitable for a certain case and a certain person is a lengthy and complicated process, requiring the knowledge of a professional. Certain antidepressants can initially make depression worse, can induce [[anxiety]], or can make a patient aggressive, dysphoric or acutely [[suicidal]]. In certain cases, an antidepressant can induce a switch from depression to [[mania]] or [[hypomania]], can accelerate and shorten a manic cycle (i.e. promote a rapid-cycling pattern), or can induce the development of [[psychosis]] (or just the re-activation of latent psychosis) in a patient with depression who wasn't psychotic before the antidepressant.

==Side effects==
Antidepressants can often cause [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s, and an inability to tolerate these is the most common cause of discontinuing the medication.

===General=== 
Although recent drugs may have fewer side effects, patients sometimes report severe side effects associated with their discontinuation, particularly with [[paroxetine]]. Additionally, a certain percentage of patients do not respond to antidepressant drugs. Another advantage of some newer antidepressants is they can show effects within as few as five days, whereas most take four to six weeks to show a change in mood. However, some studies show that these medications might be even more likely to result in moderate to severe sexual dysfunction.  However, there are medications in trials that appear to show an improved profile in regard to sexual dysfunction and other key side effects. 

MAO inhibitors can produce a lethal hypertensive reaction if taken with foods that contain high levels of [[tyramine]], such as cheese and wine. Likewise, lethal reactions to both prescription and over the counter medications have occurred. Any patient currently undergoing therapy with an MAO inhibiting medication should be monitored closely by the prescribing physician and always consulted before taking an over the counter or prescribed medication. Such patients should also inform emergency room personnel and information should be kept with one's identification indicating the fact that the holder is on MAO inhibiting medications. Some doctors even suggest the use of a medical alert ID bracelet. 

Antidepressants often make the [[mania|manic]] component of [[bipolar disorder]] worse, and should be used with great care in the treatment of that disorder, usually in conjunction with [[mood stabilisers]]. Their use should be monitored by a psychiatrist, but in countries such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[New Zealand]], and the United States, primary care physicians are able to prescribe antidepressants without consulting a psychiatrist. 

In particular, it has been noted that the most dangerous period for [[suicide]] in a patient with depression is immediately after treatment has commenced, as antidepressants may reduce the symptoms of depression such as [[psychomotor retardation]] or lack of motivation before mood starts to improve. Although this appears to be a paradox, studies indicate the suicidal ideation is a relatively common component of the initial phases of antidepressant therapy, and it may be even more prevalent in younger patients such as pre-adolescents and teenagers. It is strongly recommended that other family members and loved ones monitor the young patient's behavior, especially in the first eight weeks of therapy, for any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviors.

===Sexual===
[[Sexual dysfunction]] is a very common side effect, especially with [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]]. [[Bupropion]], a DRI, in many cases results in a moderately increased libido. Some clinicians have found that adding bupropion to a regimen of SSRI medications can sometimes alleviate some degree of sexual dysfunction. However, the mechanism of action for bupropion appears to be unique and quite different from other mood elevators, among these being a stimulant-like effect and concurrent insomnia, especially in the first few weeks of use. Moreover, some patients, as seen with most psycho-active drugs, cannot tolerate it at all.

==Opioids==
Opium has been known as an antidepressant since Biblical times.[http://opioids.com/red.html] Various [[Opiates]] were commonly used as antidepressants until the mid-1950s, when they fell out of favor with medical orthodoxy due to their addictive nature. A [[clinical trial]] conducted at Harvard Medical School in 1995,[http://opioids.com/buprenorphine/buprefdep.html] demonstrated that a majority of treatment-refractory, unipolar, non[[psychotic]], major depression patients could be successfully treated with an opioid medication called [[Buprenorphine]]. While opioids have been proven to substantially relieve symptoms of depression, re-acceptance of this fact has been severely hampered by governmental narcotic [[Prohibition (drugs)|prohibition]] efforts.

==Controversy==
Several studies have stimulated doubt about the effectiveness of antidepressants. The studies cite that the difference between antidepressants and placebo is negligible. Antidepressants work only slightly better than placebo, and the Food and Drug Administration has not informed physicians of how little benefit most of these depression drugs offer (Kirsch I, Moore TJ, Scoboria A, Nicholls SS (2002a), The emperor's new drugs: an analysis of antidepressant medication data 
submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Prevention &amp; Treatment 5:Article 23[http://journals.apa.org/prevention/volume5/toc-jul15-02.html]).

Through a Freedom of Information Act request, two psychologists obtained 47 studies used by the FDA for approval of the six antidepressants prescribed most widely between 1987-99. Overall, antidepressant pills worked 18 % better than placebos, a  statistically significant difference, &quot;but not meaningful for people in clinical settings,&quot; says University of Connecticut  psychologist Irving Kirsch. He and co-author Thomas Moore released their findings in &quot;Prevention and Treatment,&quot; an e-journal of the American Psychological Association.

More than half of the 47 studies found that patients on antidepressants improved no more than those on placebos, Kirsch says. &quot;They should have told the American public about this. The drugs have been touted as much more effective than they are.&quot; He says studies finding no benefit have been mentioned only on labeling for [[Celexa]], the most recently approved drug. The others included in his evaluation: [[Prozac]], [[Paxil]], [[Zoloft]], [[Efexor]] and [[Serzone]].

Additional papers have been published regarding the benefits of atypical vs. typical antidepresants.  These are timely papers given the need for [[Evidence based medicine | evidence based medicine]], as well as the cost of health care.  Discussion of a key paper reviewing this topic titled &quot;Quantitative analysis of sponsorship bias in economic studies of antidepressants&quot; can be found at an [http://journalreview.org/view_pubmed_article.php?pmid=14645020&amp;specialty_id=18 an on line journal club]

==Alternative medicine==
Despite controversy, alternative treatments for depression such as the herbal remedy [[St John's wort]] and the amino acid derivative [[S-adenosyl methionine|SAM-e]] have also gained popularity in recent years, although their effectiveness varies.  Clinical trials have shown SAM-e to be as effective as standard antidepressant medication, with many fewer side effects (Delle Chiaie et al., 2002; Mischoulon and Fava, 2002).  Most studies conclude that St. John's wort is usually as effective against depressions as other modern medication, again with fewer side effects, and it is widely prescribed for depression in [[Europe]].  However, a recent study showed St. John's wort to be no more effective than a placebo in cases of severe depression (Hypericum Depression Trial Study Group, 2002).  [[Tryptophan]] dietary supplements, although banned in many countries due to impurities that caused a blood disease, have also been used as natural antidepressants. Dietary supplements of [[5-HTP]], a chemical the body forms from tryptophan and uses to make serotonin, have shown some promising research results but need further study.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Auger emission''' (pronounced Oh-jhay) is a phenomenon in [[physics]] in which the emission of an [[electron]] from an [[atom]] causes the emission of a second electron.  This second ejected electron is called an '''Auger electron'''.

The name ''Auger electron'' comes from one of its discoverers, [[Pierre Victor Auger]]. The name does not come from the similarly-named device, the [[auger]].

When an [[electron]] is removed from a core level of an [[atom]], leaving a vacancy, an electron from a higher energy level may fall into the vacancy, resulting in a release of [[energy]]. Although sometimes this energy is released in the form of an emitted [[photon]], the energy can also be transferred to another electron, which is then ejected from the atom. 

Upon ejection the [[kinetic energy]] of the Auger electron corresponds to the difference between the energy of the initial electronic transition and the ionization energy for the shell from which the Auger electron was ejected. These energy levels depend on the type of atom and the chemical environment in which the atom was located. [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] stimulates the emission of Auger electrons by bombarding a sample with either [[X-ray]]s or energetic electrons and measures the intensity of Auger electrons as a function of the Auger electron energy. The resulting spectra can be used to determine the identity of the emitting atoms and some information about their environment.

A similar Auger effect occurs in [[semiconductor]]s. An electron and [[electron hole]] can recombine giving up their energy to an electron in the conduction band, increasing its energy. 

The reverse effect is known as [[impact ionization]].

==History==

The Auger emission process was discovered in the 1920s by [[Lise Meitner]], an Austrian physicist. Subsequently [[Pierre Victor Auger]], a French Physicist, also discovered the process. Auger reported the discovery in the journal ''Radium'' in 1925 and it was Auger that had the process named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the business definition. For the definition as used by intelligence agencies, see [[Asset (Intelligence)]]''
In [[business]] and [[accounting]] an '''asset''' is anything owned which can produce future economic benefit, whether in [[possession]] or by right to take possession, by a person or a group acting together, e.g. a [[types of companies|company]], the measurement of which can be expressed in monetary terms.  Asset is listed on the [[balance sheet]].  It has a [[normal balance]] of [[debit]].  

Similarly, in [[economics]] an asset is any form in which [[wealth]] can be held.

==Classification of assets==
Assets may be classified in many ways. In a company's [[balance sheet]] certain divisions are required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which vary from country to country.
===US GAAP===
The following is an example of classification according to [[US GAAP]].
====Current assets====
Current assets are cash and other assets expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed either in a year or in the operating cycle. These assets are continually turned over in the course of a business during normal business activity. There are 5 major items included into current assets:
# '''Cash''' - it is the most liquid asset, which includes currency, [[bank deposit]]s, and [[negotiable instrument]]s (e.g., money orders, checks, bank drafts). 
# '''Short-term investments''' - include securities bought and held for sale in the near future to generate income on short-term price differences (trading securities).
# '''Receivables''' - usually reported as net of allowance for uncollectible accounts.
# '''[[Inventory]]''' - trading these assets is a normal business of a company. The inventory value reported on the [[balance sheet]] is usually the historical cost or fair market value, whichever is lower. This is known as the &quot;lower of cost or market&quot; rule.
# '''Prepaid expenses''' - these are expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used or consumed (a common example is insurance). See also [[adjusting entries]].

The phrase ''net current assets'' (also called ''[[working capital]]'') is often used and refers to the total of current assets less the total of current [[liability|liabilities]].

====Long-term investments====
Often referred to simply as &quot;investments.&quot; Long-term investments are to be held for many years and are not intended to be disposed in the near future. This group usually consists of four types of investments:
# Investments in securities, such as bonds, common stock, or long-term notes.
# Investments in fixed assets not used in operations (e.g., land held for sale).
# Investments in special funds (e.g., sinking funds or pension funds).
# Investments in subsidiaries or affiliated companies.

====Fixed assets====
Also referred to as PPE (property, plant, and equipment). Assets which are purchased for continued and long-term use in earning [[profit]] in a business. This group includes [[Land (economics)|land]], [[building]]s, [[machinery]], furniture, tools, wasting resources (timberland, minerals), etc. They are written off against [[profit]]s over their anticipated life by charging [[depreciation]] expenses (with exception of land). Accumulated depreciation is shown in the face of the balance sheet or in the notes.

These are also called [[capital asset]]s in [[management accounting]], especially when [[intangibles]] are considered.

====Intangible assets====
Intangible assets lack physical substance and usually are very hard to evaluate. They include [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, [[franchising|franchise]]s, [[goodwill]], [[trademark]]s, trade names, etc. These assets are (according to US GAAP) amortized to expense over 5 to 40 years with exception of goodwill.

====Other assets====
This section includes a high variety of assets, most commonly:
*long-term prepaid expenses
*long-term receivables
*intangible assets (if they represent just a very small fraction of total assets)
*property held for sale.
In a lot of cases this section is too general and broad, because assets could be classified into four above categories.

==Definition of asset==

An asset has potential to earn revenue, its value is managed over life cycle and its failure leads to irrecoverable commercial loss. 'Human asset' is a new term for knowledge economy where professionals are not in problem solving mode but in opportunity creation state. For knowledge economy, achievement is not the term; contribution is the key to success. Human asset can assure that. 

Knowledge economy perceives knowledge as the key driver of economic processes. It
involves weaving knowledge acquisition, enhancement and innovation into the fabric of
the organizations operating in the knowledge zone. The professional domain being a
superset of the organizational domain offers limitless opportunities to explore, enhance
and innovate. Presence of an asset stresses on exploration, innovation in the domain space to bring excellence and exhibit the domain spirit for opportunity creation. Every organization is
being faced with a fresh set of challenges and the solution lies in devising newer ways of
harnessing knowledge, leveraging the extended knowledge base to deliver previously
unoffered solutions. The key enabler in such a scenario will be a pool of experts or assets
who by interaction with the industry and commitment to a particular domain will be in a
position to forecast market trends and develop products and, or solutions in line with such
trends. In order to further understand the advantage of opportunity creation against problem
solving we need to understand the key differences between the concepts. Problem
solving, an approach Indian knowledge workers often adopt involves investing in “made
to order” solutions. It is basically a quick-fix, adhoc approach wherein a given problem is
attacked and solved without resort to in depth analysis or study. While the approach does
solve the problem at hand and generates immediate revenue with reduced risk it may not
ensure future business in a similar domain. Since the emphasis is on the problem at hand,
implicit possibilities are overlooked; the whole approach becomes delivery-centric. As
innovation is not encouraged per se creative people are discouraged and lose their
excellence committing their energy towards often performing mundane repetitive tasks.
Opportunity creation on the other hand requires a long term commitment and investment.
Suppose a problem at hand is automating process X for XYZ industry. While problem
solving would stop at automating X, opportunity creation would take this a step further to
study and analyze the domain, to determine if there is equivalent need for automation in
industries operating in similar domain, maybe determine if a customizable solution may
be provided which may then be reused in future to solve such a problem should it recur.

The difference between problem solving and opportunity creation may be likened to the
difference between buying and renting a house: one aims at creation of a permanent asset
that may be a source of potential income, the other devises a low risk, low gain solution
that in the long run kills the more important aim of building the house.
Opportunity creation requires expertise, skill and commitment, it calls for the creation of
a pool of experts with their key specializations who are conscious of the industry at large,
who can utilize their awareness to unlock new avenues of earning revenue. 

Human Assets are a set of motivated and talented individuals, build them up through the various stages so that they may become rain makers in the industry perceiving and tackling new challenges and creating opportunities, the worth of which may be judged in the open competitive space of knowledge intensive industries.

'''Akio Morita''' (&amp;#30427;&amp;#30000;&amp;#26157;&amp;#22827; ''Morita Akio'', [[January 26]], [[1921]] in [[Nagoya, Japan]] - [[October 3]], [[1999]] in [[Tokyo]]) was a co-founder of [[Sony]] Corporation.

Trained as a physicist, Morita was an officer in the Japanese [[navy]] during [[World War II]].  His family was involved in [[sake]] production. He met [[Masaru Ibuka]] in the [[Wartime Research Committee]]; on [[May 7]], [[1946]], they founded [[Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo K.K]]. (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, later [[Sony]]) with approximately 20 employees and initial capital of 190,000 yen. Ibuka was 38 years old at the time and Morita was 25.

In [[1949]] the company developed magnetic recording tape and in [[1950]] sold the first tape recorder in [[Japan]]. In [[1957]] it produced a pocket-sized [[radio]] and a year later renamed itself Sony (sonus is [[Latin]] for [[sound]], and ''Sonny-boys'' is Japanese [[slang]] for &quot;[[whiz kid]]s&quot;). In [[1960]] it produced the first [[transistor]] [[television]] in the world. 

In [[1961]] Sony Corporation of America was the first Japanese company to be listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. In [[1989]] Sony bought [[Columbia Pictures]].

In the early 1990's, he was famous for co-authoring an essay ''[[The Japan that Can Say No]]'' with politician [[Shintaro Ishihara]], which was critical of United States business practices, and encouraged Japanese to take a more independent role in business and foreign affairs.

On [[November 25]], [[1994]], Morita announced his resignation as Sony chairman, after suffering a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] while playing [[tennis]]. His successor, [[Norio Ohga]], had joined the company after sending Morita a letter denouncing the poor quality of the company's tape recorders.

Morita also wrote a book called ''[[Never Mind School Records]]'' in the '60s, which stressed that school records are not important in one's success or ability to do business. He was also Vice Chairman of the [[Keidanren]] ([[Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]]) and was a member of the [[Japan-U.S. Economic Relations Group]], (also known as the &quot;[[Wise Men's Group]]&quot;).

He was awarded the [[Albert Medal]] from the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1982; he was the first Japanese to receive the honour. Two years later, he received the prestigious [[Légion d'honneur | National Order of the Legion of Honor]] and in 1991, he was awarded the [[First Class Order of the Sacred Treasure]] from H. M. the Emperor of Japan.

He died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 78.

      <comment>corrected polarity of electrolytic cell</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Zinc anode.png|thumb|Diagram of a [[zinc]] anode in a [[galvanic cell|Daniell's cell]].]]

An '''anode''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''άνοδος'' = 'going up') is the [[electrode]] in a device that electrons flow out of to return to the circuit.  Literally, the path through which the [[electron]]s ascend out of an [[electrolyte]] solution. The other charged electrode in the same cell or device is the [[cathode]].  For electrons to flow through the anode, a positive charge is applied to the anode (attracting electrons).

== Flow of electrons ==
The flow of electrons is '''always''' from '''''anode–to–cathode''''' '''outside''' of the cell or device, and from '''''cathode–to–anode''''' '''inside''' the cell or device, regardless of the cell or device type.  Inside a chemical cell, ions are carrying the electrons, but the flow is still from '''''cathode–to–anode''''' '''inside''' the cell.
Note that most [[electronics|electronic]] circuit diagrams, and their symbols for diodes and transistors, show &quot;conventional&quot; current, which flows from positive to negative, but the actual '''electrons''' in the circuit flow the '''OPPOSITE''' way.

== Electrolytic anode ==
In [[electrochemistry]], the '''anode''' is where [[oxidation]] occurs, and is the positive polarity contact in an [[electrolytic cell]]. At the anode, anions are forced by the electrical potential to react chemically and give off electrons (oxidation) which then flow up and into the driving circuit.

== Battery or galvanic cell anode ==
In a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[galvanic cell]], the anode is the negative contact from which electrons flow towards the circuit. Internally the anions are flowing to the anodic material inside the cell which is connected to the negative contact of the cell; but, external to the cell in the circuit, electrons are being pushed out through the negative contact and thus through the circuit by the voltage potential of the cell.

== Vacuum tube anode ==
In electronic vacuum devices such as a [[cathode ray tube]], the anode is the positively-charged electron collector.  In a tube, the anode is a charged positive plate that collects the electrons emitted by the cathode through electric attraction. 

== Diode anode ==
In a [[semiconductor]] [[diode]], the anode is the P-doped layer which initially supplies '''[[electrons]]''' to the junction.  In the junction region, the electrons supplied by the anode combine with holes supplied from the N-doped region, creating a depleted zone.  As the P-doped layer supplies electrons to the depleted region, positive dope ions are left behind in the P-doped layer ('P' for positive charge-carrier ions).  This creates a base positive charge on the anode.  When a positive voltage is applied to anode of the diode from the circuit, more '''[[electrons]]''' are able to be transferred to the depleted region, and this causes the diode to become conductive, allowing current to flow through the circuit.  The terms anode and cathode should not be applied to a zener diode, since it allows flow in either direction, depending on the polarity of the applied potential (i.e. voltage).

== Sacrificial anode ==
In [[cathodic protection]], a metal anode that is more reactive to the corrosive environment of the system to be protected is electrically linked to the protected system, and partially [[corrosion|corrodes]] or dissolves, which protects the metal of the system it is connected to.  As an example, an [[iron]] or [[steel]] [[hull (watercraft)|ship's hull]] may be protected by a zinc sacrificial anode, which will dissolve into the seawater and prevent the hull from being corroded.  Sacrificial anodes are particularly needed for systems where a [[electrostatics|static charge]] is generated by the action of flowing liquids, such as pipelines and watercraft.

== Related antonym ==
The opposite of an anode is a [[cathode]].  When the charge on the system is reversed, the [[electrodes]] switch functions, so [[anode]] becomes [[cathode]], while [[cathode]] becomes [[anode]], as long as the reversed charge is applied.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Analog television''' (or '''analogue television''') encodes [[television]] picture information as an [[analog signal]], that is, by varying the and/or [[Frequency|frequencies]] of the [[Signal (information theory)|signal]]. All systems preceding [[digital television]] can be considered analog.

Analog signals will cease to operate in the United States starting on [[February 17]], [[2009]], making all television sets without a digital tuner unable to receive television broadcasts without an external digital broadcast receiver.

Starting in 2008, the analogue service in the [[United Kingdom]] will cease to operate with the entire country have analogue switched off by 2012. The [[BBC]] have been encouraging viewers to get digital television by broadcasting digital television programs on their terrestial channels. London will be hosting the [[London 2012|Olympic Games]] in [[2012]] so all British coverage of the games will be in digital.

Common analog television systems:
* [[NTSC]]
* [[PAL]]
* [[SÉCAM]]
* [[Slow-scan television]]
* [[Narrow-bandwidth television]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:LocationAfricaEurasia.png|thumb|300px|right|Africa-Eurasia]]
The [[supercontinent]] of '''Africa-Eurasia''', or '''Afro-Eurasia''', is the world's largest land mass and contains around 85% of the human population. It is typically subdivided into the [[continent|continents]] [[Africa]] and [[Eurasia]] (which is culturally, but not geographically, divided into [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]) by drawing a line at the [[Suez Canal]]. Historians of the [[cultural materialism]] school may subdivide it into Eurasia-[[North Africa]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], based on differing agricultural systems. (See [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]] for example.) 
 
Some geographers and historians have referred to it as '''Eurafrasia''' or '''Afrasia''' (omitting the European [[peninsula]]), although these terms have never come into general use. In [[geopolitics]] the mainland of Africa-Eurasia (excluding islands such as the [[British Isles]], [[Japan]] and [[Madagascar]]) is sometimes it has also been referred as the '''World Island'''.

The [[Old World]] includes Africa-Eurasia and its surrounding islands.

An '''adhesive''' is a compound that [[adhesion|adheres]] or bonds two items together. Adhesives may come from either natural or synthetic sources.  Some modern adhesives are extremely strong, and are becoming increasingly important in modern construction and industry.

The first adhesives were [[gum]]s and other plant [[resin]]s.  Archaeologists have found 6000-year-old [[ceramic]] vessels that had broken and been repaired using plant resin.  Most early adhesives were [[animal glue]]s made by rendering animal products such as the Native American use of [[American Bison|buffalo]] hooves. Native Americans in what is now the eastern United States used a mixture of [[spruce]] gum and fat as adhesives and as [[caulk]] to waterproof seams in their birchbark canoes.  During the times of Babylonia, tar-like glue was used for gluing statues.  Also, Egypt was one of the most prominent users of adhesives. The Egyptians used animal glues to adhere tombs, furniture, ivory, and papyrus.  Also, the Mongols used adhesives to make their short bows.  In Europe in the Middle Ages, egg whites were used to decorate parchments with gold leaves.  In the [[1700s]], the first glue factory was founded in Holland, which manufactured hide glue.  Later, in the [[1750s]], the British introduced fish glue.  As the modernization continued, new patents were issued by using rubber, bones, starch, fish, and casein. Modern adhesives have improved flexibility, toughness, curing rate, temperature and chemical resistance. (HSL)

==Categories of adhesives==

===Natural Adhesives===

Adhesives based on vegetable (natural resin), food (animal hide and skin), and mineral sources (inorganic materials). (HSL)

===Synthetic Adhesives===

Adhesives based on elastomers, thermoplastic, and thermosetting adhesives.

=== Drying adhesives ===
These adhesives are a mixture of ingredients (typically [[polymers]]) dissolved in a [[solvent]]. [[Glue]]s and [[rubber cement]]s are members of the ''drying adhesive'' family. As the solvent evaporates, the adhesive hardens. Depending on the chemical composition of the adhesive, they will adhere to different materials to greater or lesser degrees. These adhesives are typically weak and are used for [[household]] applications. Some intended for small children are now made non-toxic.

===Hot adhesives (Thermoplastic adhesive)===
[[Image:MVC-013F.JPG|right|thumbnail|200px|A glue gun, an example of a hot adhesive]]
Also known as &quot;hot melt&quot; adhesives, these adhesives are generally [[thermoplastic]]s; they are applied hot and simply allowed to harden as they cool. These adhesives have become popular for crafts because of their ease of use and the wide range of common materials to which they can adhere. A glue gun, pictured right, is one method of applying a hot adhesive. The glue gun melts the solid adhesive and then allows the liquid to pass through the &quot;barrel&quot; of the gun onto the material where it solidifies.

=== Reactive adhesives ===
Reactive adhesives are generally [[thermosetting plastic]]s. [[Epoxy resin]]s are the most common example of this kind of adhesive. Reactive adhesives generally come in two separate containers. The two ingredients of the adhesive must be mixed in certain proportions immediately before application.  Generally one ingredient is a [[monomer]], or [[resin]], and the second is a reaction initialiser. When the two are mixed together, a [[polymer]]isation reaction occurs which solidifies the adhesive.

Reaction adhesives may also react with the surface of the materials to be stuck together. This process is called [[bonding]], in which the adhesive forms chemical bonds with the material, and is distinct from sticking, the action of common glues.

A special case of this kind of adhesive is [[cyanoacrylate]] (more commonly known by the brand name &quot;super glue&quot;) which reacts with trace moisture on the surfaces being bonded and therefore does not need any mixing before application.

Reactive adhesives are very strong and are used for high-stress applications such as attaching wings to aircraft. Because the strength of a reactive adhesive is a result of chemical bonding with the surface material, reactive adhesives are applied in thin films. Reactive adhesives are less effective when there is a secondary goal of filling gaps between the surfaces..

Such adhesives are frequently used to prevent loosening of bolts and screws in rapidly moving assemblies, such as automobile engines. They are largely responsible for the quieter running modern car engines.

=== Temporary adhesives ===
Temporary adhesives are designed to repeatedly or easily stick and unstick. They have low adhesion and generally can not support much weight. They are commonly used on paper, but can be used on many other things. They have common applications such as bookmarks, informal notes, and office supplies. Brands include [[Blu-Tack]], a gum-like adhesive (a.k.a. &quot;sticky tak&quot;), [[Sticking plaster|adhesive bandages]], and the pressure-activated adhesive applied to the back of [[3M]]'s [[Post-it note]]s. The adhesives on items such as [[duct tape]] can generally adhere longer than these other products. 

Also see [[adhesive tape]] and [[gaffer tape]].

[[Plastic wrap]] displays temporary adhesive properties as well.

== Adhesive failure ==
{{cleanup-date|February 2006}}
Adhesives may fail in one of two ways:

Adhesive failure is the failure of the adhesive to stick or bond with the material to be adhered (also known as the substrate or adherend).

Cohesive failure is structural failure of the adhesive.  Adhesive remains on both substrate surfaces, but the two items separate.

Two substrates can also separate through structural failure of one of the substrates; this is not a failure of the adhesive.  In this case the adhesive remains intact and is still bonded to one substrate and the remnants of the other.

For example, when one removes a price label, adhesive usually remains on the label and the surface.  This is cohesive failure.  If, however, a layer of paper remains stuck to the surface, the adhesive has not failed.

As another example, when someone tries to pull apart [[Oreo]] cookies with the filling all on one side.  The goal is an adhesive failure, rather than a cohesive failure.

[[Image:Anothony hopkins in fastest indian.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hopkins in ''[[The World's Fastest Indian]]'']]
[[Image:Heyes.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hopkins in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs]]'']]
'''Sir''' '''Anthony Hopkins''' ({{IPA2|'æntəni 'hɒpkɪnz}}) [[Commander of the British Empire|CBE]] (born [[December 31]], [[1937]]) is a [[Welsh]]-born  [[actor]] who was born '''Philip Anthony Hopkins''' in Margam, near [[Port Talbot]], [[Wales]]. His parents were the late Richard Arthur Hopkins and Muriel Yeats, who is a distant relation of poet [[William Butler Yeats]]. He was influenced and encouraged to become an actor by fellow Welshman [[Richard Burton]], whom he met briefly at the age of fifteen.  Hopkins eventually moved to London where he trained as an actor at [[RADA]].

He is an acknowledged [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who has been abstinent since [[1975]]. He now resides in the United States where he became a [[naturalization|naturalized citizen]] on [[April 12]], [[2000]]. However, as a dual national, he retains his [[British honours system|knighthood]] and can use the title 'Sir' in the UK, but not in the US, since it is considered 'inappropriate' according to the British consulate. Proud of his [[United States|American]] citizenship, Hopkins stated that as soon as he became a citizen of the country, he went on a 3,000 mile road trip across [[United States|America]].

Hopkins has been married three times. His first two wives were Petronella Barker (1967-[[1972]]) and Jennifer Lynton (1973-[[2003]]). He is now married to [[Stella Arroyave]]. He has a daughter named Abigail Hopkins (born 1968) from his first marriage.

His most famous role was the portrayal of the [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[serial killer]] [[Hannibal Lecter]] in the film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (for which he won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]) opposite [[Jodie Foster]] as [[Clarice Starling]], who also won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] that year. In fact the film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] as well that year, no doubt due to the electrifying interplay between Hopkins and Foster. It is the shortest lead acting Oscar-winning performance ever, as Hopkins is only on the screen for about sixteen minutes. Hopkins reprised the role of Dr. Lecter twice in ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' and ''[[Red Dragon]]''. Lecter first appears in the film ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'', in which the role was played by [[Brian Cox]]. ''Red Dragon'' was a remake of ''Manhunter'', which allowed Hopkins to play Lecter in adaptations of all three Lecter novels. Lecter's slurping sound from ''Silence of the Lambs'' was apparently improvised; although, Hopkins admits during the Criterion Laserdisc commentary track it may have been influenced by [[Bela Lugosi]] (with no remembrance which movie it would be from). All three films were based on the bestselling novels by [[Thomas Harris]], who reportedly was very pleased with Hopkins' portrayal of Lecter.

Hopkins has also been Oscar-nominated for ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'' (1993), which was based on the award-winning novel by [[Kazuo Ishiguro]].  Other Oscar-nominated performances include ''[[Nixon (movie)|Nixon]]'' (1995) and ''[[Amistad (1997 movie)|Amistad]]'' (1997).  He also won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor]] for his perfomances in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs]]'' and ''[[The Remains of the Day]]''.

He has played many famous historical and fictional characters including: [[Zorro]] (''The Mask of Zorro'' 1998), [[Quasimodo]] (''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1982 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' [[1982]]), [[Othello]] (''Othello'' 1981), [[Pablo Picasso]] (''Surviving Picasso'' 1996), [[Richard Nixon]] (''Nixon'' 1995), [[Titus Andronicus]] (''Titus'' 1999), [[John Quincy Adams]] (''[[Amistad (1997 movie)|Amistad]]'' [[1997]]), [[Adolf Hitler]] (''The Bunker'' 1981), [[John Dutton Frost|John Frost]] (''A Bridge Too Far'' 1977) [[Charles Dickens]] (''The Great Inimitable Mr. Dickens'' 1970), [[William Bligh]] (''The Bounty'' 1984), [[Richard Lionheart]] (''[[The Lion in Winter]]'' [[1968]]), [[David Lloyd George]] (''Young Winston'' 1972),  [[Abraham Van Helsing]] (''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' [[1992]]), [[Yitzak Rabin]] (''[[Victory at Entebbe]]'' [[1976]]) and [[C. S. Lewis]] (''[[Shadowlands]]'' [[1993]]).

He was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1987, and knighted in 1993.

Today, Hopkins also takes time to support various [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] groups. Hopkins was past Gala Fundraiser Guest of Honour for Women in Recovery, Inc., a [[Venice, California]]-based non-profit organization offering rehabilitation for women in need. He is also a volunteer teacher at the Ruskins School of Acting in Santa Monica, California where he also resides.

He has offered his support to various charities and appeals, notably becoming President of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]'s [[Snowdonia]] Appeal, raising funds for the preservation of the [[Snowdonia National Park]] and to aid the Trust's efforts to purchase parts of [[Snowdon]]. A book celebrating these efforts ''Anthony Hopkins' Snowdonia'' was published together with Graham Nobles.

In [[2006 in film|2006]], Hopkins was the recipient of the [[Golden Globe]] [[Cecil_B._DeMille_Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for lifetime achievement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the computer software usage of API. For other uses, see [[API (disambiguation)]].''

An '''application programming interface''' ('''API''') is the [[Interface (computer science)| interface]] that a computer system, library or application provides in order to allow requests for service to be made of it by other computer programs, and/or to allow data to be exchanged between them.

==Description==
One of the primary purposes of an '''API''' is to describe how to access a set of [[Subroutine|functions]] - for example, an API might describe how to draw [[Window (computing)|windows]] or [[icon (computing)|icon]]s on the screen using a library that has been written for that purpose.  APIs, like most interfaces, are abstract.  Software that may be accessed via a particular API is said to ''implement'' that API.

For instance, a computer program can (and often must) use its [[operating system]]'s API to allocate memory and access files. Many types of systems and applications implement APIs, such as graphics systems, databases, networks, web services, and even some computer games.

In many instances, an API is often a part of a ''[[Software development kit]]'' (SDK). An SDK may include an API as well as other tools and perhaps even some hardware, so the two terms are not strictly interchangeable.

There are various design models for APIs. Interfaces intended for the fastest [[execution (computers)|execution]] often consist of sets of [[Subroutine|functions]], [[procedure]]s, [[variable]]s and [[data structure]]s. However, other models exist as well, such as the [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] used to evaluate expressions in [[ECMAScript]]/[[JavaScript]].  or abstraction layer, which relieves the programmer from needing to know how the functions of the API relate to the lower levels of abstraction. This makes it possible to redesign or improve the functions within the API without breaking code that relies on it.

Two general lines of policies exist regarding publishing APIs:

# Some companies guard their APIs zealously. For example, [[Sony]] used to make its official [[PlayStation 2]] API available only to licensed PlayStation developers. This is because Sony wanted to restrict how many people could write a PlayStation 2 [[game]], and wanted to profit from them as much as possible. This is typical of companies who do not profit from the sale of API implementations (in this case, Sony broke even on the sale of PlayStation 2 consoles and even took a loss on [[marketing]], instead making it up through game royalties created by API [[licensing]]). However, [[PlayStation 3]] is based entirely on open and publicly available APIs.
# Other companies propagate their APIs freely. For example, [[Microsoft]] deliberately makes most of its API information public, so that software will be written for the Windows [[System platform|platform]]. The sale of the third-party software sells copies of Microsoft Windows. This is typical of companies who profit from the sale of API implementations (in this case, [[Microsoft Windows]], which is sold at a gain for Microsoft).

Some APIs, such as the ones standard to an [[operating system]], are implemented as separate [[Library (software) | code libraries]] that are distributed with the operating system.  Others require [[software publisher]]s to integrate the API functionality directly into the application. This forms another distinction in the examples above. Microsoft Windows APIs come with the operating system for anyone to use. Software for [[embedded system]]s such as [[video game console]]s generally falls into the application-integrated category. While an official PlayStation API document may be interesting to read, it is of little use without its corresponding [[implementation]], in the form of a separate [[Library (computer science)|library]] or [[Software development kit|software development kit]].

An API that does not require royalties for [[access]] and [[usage]] is called &quot;open.&quot; The APIs provided by [[Free software]] (such as all software distributed under the [[GNU General Public License]]), are open by definition, since anyone can look into the [[source]] of the software and figure out the API. Although usually authoritative &quot;[[reference implementation]]s&quot; exist for an API (such as [[Microsoft Windows]] for the [[Win32]] API), there's nothing that prevents the creation of additional implementations. For example, most of the Win32 API can be provided under a [[Unix|UNIX]] system using software called [[Wine (software)|Wine]].

It is generally lawful to analyze API implementations in order to produce a compatible one. This technique is called [[reverse engineering]] for the purposes of [[interoperability]]. However, the legal situation is often ambiguous, so that care and [[lawyer|legal counsel]] should be taken before the reverse engineering is carried out. For example, while APIs usually do not have an obvious legal status, they might include [[patent|patents]] that may not be used until the patent holder gives permission.

'''Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.''' ('''AMD''') {{nyse|AMD}} is a manufacturer of [[integrated circuits]] based in [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], [[California]]. It is the second-largest supplier of [[x86]]-compatible [[Central Processing Unit|processor]]s, and a leading supplier of [[flash memory|non-volatile flash memory]]. It was founded in 1969 by a group of defectors from [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], including [[Jerry Sanders]]. AMD's current CEO is [[Héctor Ruiz|Dr. Héctor Ruiz]]. The current president and Chief Operating Officer is [[Dirk Meyer]].

AMD is best known for the [[Athlon]], [[Opteron]], [[Turion64]], [[Sempron]] and [[Duron]] lines of x86-compatible processors. 
== Financial information ==
AMD is publicly traded at [[NYSE]] with the symbol AMD. Its [[market capitalization]] was around US$13 billion at the end of 2005.

== General history ==
[[Image:AMD C8080A.jpg|thumb|Early AMD 8080 Processor (AMD AM9080ADC / C8080A), 1977]]The company started as a producer of logic chips in 1969, then entered the [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] chip business in 1975. That same year, it introduced a [[reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] clone of the [[Intel]] [[Intel 8080|8080]] [[microprocessor]]. During this period, AMD also designed and produced a series of [[bit-slice]] processor elements ([[Am2900]], Am29116, Am293xx) which were used in various minicomputer designs.

During this time, AMD attempted to embrace the perceived shift towards [[RISC]] with their own [[Am29000|AMD 29K processor]], and they attempted to diversify into graphics and audio devices as well as flash memory. While the AMD 29K survived as an [[embedded processor]] and AMD continues to make industry leading [[flash memory]], AMD was not as successful with its other endeavours.  AMD decided to switch gears and concentrate solely on Intel-compatible microprocessors and flash memory.  This put them in direct competition with Intel for x86 compatible processors and their flash memory secondary markets.

== 8086, 80286, 80386, Am486 ==
[[Image:Amd_intel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|AMD 80286 1982]] 

In February 1982, AMD signed a contract with [[Intel]], becoming a licensed second-source manufacturer of [[Intel 8086|8086]] and [[Intel 8088|8088]] processors. [[International Business Machines|IBM]] wanted to use the Intel 8088 in its [[IBM PC]], but IBM's policy at the time was to require at least two sources for its chips. AMD later produced the [[80286]], or 286, under the same arrangement, but Intel cancelled the agreement in 1986, and refused to hand over technical details of the i386 part. The growing popularity of the [[IBM PC compatible|PC clone]] market meant Intel could produce CPUs on its own terms, rather than IBM's. 

AMD challenged this decision, and subsequently won under arbitration. A long legal dispute followed, ending in 1991 when the [[Supreme Court of California]] sided with AMD and forced Intel to pay over $1 billion in compensation for violation of contract. Subsequent legal disputes centered on whether AMD had legal rights to use derivatives of Intel's microcode. Rulings were made in both directions. In the face of uncertainty, AMD was forced to develop &quot;[[Clean room design|clean room]]&quot; versions of Intel code. In this fashion, one engineering team described the function of the code, and a second team without access to the source code itself had to develop microcode that performed the same functionality.

In 1991 AMD released the [[Am386]], its clone of the later Intel [[80386]] processor. It took less than a year for AMD to sell a million units. AMD's [[Am386|386DX-40]] was very popular with smaller, independent clone manufacturers. AMD followed in 1993 with the [[Am486]]. Both sold at a significantly lower price than the Intel versions. The [[Am486]] was used by a number of large [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]]s, including [[Compaq]], and proved popular, but again was just a clone of Intel's processor technology. But as product cycles shortened in the PC industry, cloning Intel's products became an ever less viable strategy for AMD, as it meant their technology would always be behind Intel. 

On [[December 30]] [[1994]] the Supreme Court of California finally formally denied AMD rights to use the i386's microcode. Afterwards AMD and Intel concluded an agreement, the details of which remain largely secret, which gave AMD the right to produce and sell microprocessors containing the microcodes of Intel 286, 386, and 486. The agreement appears to allow for full cross-licensing of [[patent]]s and some [[copyright]]s, allowing each partner to use the other's technological innovations without charge. Whatever the details, no significant legal action had resulted between AMD and Intel (until the 2005 antitrust suits in Japan and the U.S.), and the agreement evidently provided a &quot;clean break&quot;.

== K5 ==
AMD's first completely in-house processor was the [[AMD K5|K5]], launched belatedly in 1995. The &quot;K&quot; was a reference to &quot;[[Kryptonite]]&quot; which from comic book lore was the only substance that could harm Superman (a clear reference to Intel which was dominant in the market). 

It was intended to compete directly with the Intel [[Pentium]] CPU, which had been released in 1993, but architecturally it had more in common with the newly-released [[Pentium Pro]] than the Pentium or [[Cyrix]]'s [[Cyrix 6x86|6x86]], decoding x86 instructions into micro-ops and executing them on a RISC core. There were a number of problems. Many consumers were upset to learn the clock speed of their processor did not match the [[PR rating]] used to label some of the parts, and this was especially obvious at boot time, when the clock speed was posted to the main screen on many systems. 

More tellingly, the K5 couldn't match the 6x86's integer performance, nor the Pentium's [[FPU]] performance. AMD tended to use benchmarks for its rating systems that avoided FPU intensive tasks. This, combined with the large [[die]] size and the fact that the design scaled badly, doomed the K5 to near-total failure in the marketplace. To its credit, the K5 did not suffer from the compatibility problems of the 6x86 nor did it run as hotly.

While the K5 was arguably better than the Pentium classic technologically, with modern features such as out of order execution and micro-ops RISC core, AMD was slow by two years compared to Intel. Missing schedule deadlines and lack of manufacturing expertise in scaling designs would continue to plague AMD until the K7. With a new fabrication plant in Austin, they could not afford to wait for another inhouse design.

== NexGen / K6 ==
[[Image:AMD-K6-2-300.jpg|thumb|right|200px|AMD-K6-2-300]] 

In 1996, AMD purchased [[NexGen]] specifically for the rights to their Nx series of x86 compatible processors. It is fair to say the technology gained in this acquisition saved AMD, which is somewhat ironic when one considers [[NexGen]] had been founded by ex-Intel employees.

AMD gave the NexGen design team their own building, left them alone, and gave them time and money to rework the Nx686. The result was branded the [[AMD K6|K6]] processor, introduced in 1997. The redesign included a feedback dynamic instruction reordering mechanism, [[MMX]] instructions, and added the missing floating point unit (FPU). It was also made pin-compatible with Intel's Pentium, enabling it to be used in the widely available &quot;[[Socket 7]]&quot;-based motherboards. Like the Nx686 and Nx586 before it, the K6 translated the Pentium compatible x86 instruction set to [[RISC]]-like micro-instructions. In the following year, AMD released the [[AMD K6-2|K6-2]] which added a set of floating point multimedia instructions called [[3DNow!]], preceding Intel's SSE instructions, as well as a new socket standard called &quot;[[Super Socket 7]]&quot;, that extended the front side bus frequency from 66 to 100&amp;nbsp;MHz.

In January 1999, the final iteration of the K6-x series, the 450 MHz [[AMD K6-III|K6-III]], was extremely competitive with Intel's top of the line chips. This chip was essentially a K6-2 with 256&amp;nbsp;kilobytes of full-speed level 2 cache integrated into the core and a better [[branch prediction]] unit. While it matched (generally beating) the Pentium II/III in integer operations, the FPU was a non-pipelined serial design and could not compete with Intel's more advanced FPU architecture. Although [[3DNow!]] could theoretically compensate for this weakness, few game developers made use of it, the most notable exception being [[id Software]]'s ''[[Quake II]]''.

Throughout its lifetime, the [[AMD K6|K6]] processor came close, but never equalled the performance of processor offerings from Intel. While there were brief periods when AMD announced a clock speed advantage, volume availability of products was limited as AMD suffered from manufacturing and yield problems. Furthermore, having deviated from the official Intel motherboard specifications with the [[Super Socket 7]] format, the motherboards that worked with the K6 were of varying quality, especially as regards implementation of the graphical [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] specification. 

Overall the K6 proved popular with consumers, especially in markets outside North America, offering decent performance and a comparatively low price. But the problems surrounding the platform, and lack of availability for the announced high end parts, failed to establish AMD as a player in the corporate market. Intel responded to AMD's lower prices with the lower budget &quot;Celeron&quot; version of their Pentiums. While the Celerons were not as popular as Intel had hoped, this effectively left AMD struggling with low margins, chasing the low end of the market.

== Athlon / K7 ==
[[Image:amd_athlon_classic.jpg|thumb|right|200px|AMD Athlon &quot;Classic&quot; SlotA]] 
It was clear that if AMD was to survive, the company had to change strategy. CEO and founder Jerry Sanders recognized this, and developed a famous &quot;Virtual Gorilla&quot; strategy. This utilized strategic industry partnerships, to enable AMD to compete with Intel on a more equal technological footing.

The fruits of this were shown in [[August]] of 1999, when AMD released the [[Athlon]] (K7) processor. Notably, the design team was led by [[Dirk Meyer]], one of the lead engineers on the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] project. Jerry Sanders had approached many of the engineering staff to work for AMD as DEC wound the project down, in this fashion acquiring a genuine world-class-enterprise-level processor design team, for a bargain basement price.  It should be noted, though, that the Athlon design team included those who worked on both the K5 and K6.

The Athlon had an advanced micro-architecture geared towards overall performance, with a notably powerful FPU.  When compared to the [[i686#Intel|P6]] the Athlon was superior, solving many of the problems and bottlenecks that were inherent in the Intel design.  The Athlon had a higher average execution per clock throughput.  The fundamental reason that such a large design discrepancy was possible is that the original [[i686#Intel|P6]] had a much smaller transistor budget, since it was fabricated on a much earlier design process than the Athlon.  Early samples of the Athlon had branch predictor problems as well as low clock rates, but when it shipped with all architectural fixes at an amazing (for the time) 650&amp;nbsp;MHz, it sent shockwaves through the industry.

Intel was immediately forced into a panicked internal re-design of the P6 core, which fixed many of the pipeline stalls that compromised its performance. The result was called the &quot;[[Coppermine (microprocessor)|Coppermine]]&quot; revision.  However, the rushed nature of the work put enormous pressure on Intel's manufacturing facilities and, even after it was announced, availability of the improved Coppermine chips was poor.

In comparison, AMD found processor yields exceeded expectations. As a result, AMD announced 900-MHz and 1-GHz Athlons in early March 2000, and delivered them in volume that same month, again surprising the industry. Intel announced a 1-GHz Pentium a few days after AMD did, but was unable to ship the part in volume for several months. Working with [[Motorola]] as part of the &quot;Virtual Gorilla&quot; strategy, AMD also perfected copper interconnect manufacturing over a year before Intel, enjoying a clear advantage in manufacturing process technology, further improving clock speeds. Compounding Intel's embarrassment, an attempt to leapfrog AMD with a 1.13-GHz Pentium III resulted in an unreliable product that worked only on one specific customized motherboard and was heavily panned by prominent industry critics [http://www.tomshardware.com/2000/07/31/intel/index.html]. That chip was soon withdrawn from the market, having been installed in only a small handful of OEM systems [http://www.tomshardware.com/2000/08/28/intel_admits_problems_with_pentium_iii_1/index.html]. All of this greatly bolstered AMD's credibility in the market; what was formerly a producer of cut-rate clone chips was now increasingly being considered a viable competitor and rival to Intel.

AMD worked hard to increase the reliability and performance of motherboards for the Athlon with a quality assurance program. Confident with their unprecedented control of the performance end of the market, AMD was able to release a second line of budget processors, based on the Athlon core called the [[Duron]]. The combination of these astonishing technical and marketing successes did much to repair AMD's reputation, and the long time industry jokes about the company noticeably dried up.  AMD continued to undercut Intel on price at the low end with the K6, and as Intel suffered part shortages and yield problems, AMD's market share briefly rose to 23%.

From a marketing point of view, AMD made the most of its performance advantage, greater consistency in delivery, and better system stability.  The center point of its technical marketing strategy was a very large complement of easily reproducible performance benchmarks, based on a wide variety of applications.  These efforts were bolstered by review sites and magazines, which were able to add their own performance benchmarks which verified AMD's claims of performance superiority of the Athlon versus its competition from Intel for many years.  The importance of this publicity to AMD's credibility and reputation going forward cannot be overemphasized.

The spectacular success of the Athlon K7 processor started to diminish once Intel introduced the [[Pentium 4]] processor. Though the K7 was capable of much greater clock speeds than the [[Pentium 3]] line, the new [[Netburst]] architecture, designed to deliver all of its performance through deep pipeline, high clock speed methodologies started to outpace the Athlon Line. The early Pentium 4 did not quite realize the actual performance Intel had hoped for, and in some applications the original K7 Thunderbird architecture exceeded the P4 in per-cycle performance. Because the popular consensus was that the P4 was faster, the Athlon XP was released, although the chip itself was not tremendously improved (other than the progressional clock-speed increase). The Athlon XP remained competitive with overall performance until the release of the [[Pentium 4#Northwood | Pentium 4 Northwood]] CPU, which ran much more efficiently than the early Pentium 4s, and at even greater clock cycles, topping out at 3.4 GHz.

Unable to compete with the raw clock speeds offered by the P4, from the start of the Athlon XP Era, AMD began using a nomenclature that compares performance of the Athlon XP, with that of an earlier [[Athlon#Athlon Thunderbird .28T-Bird.29|Thunderbird]] core revision. In reality most people saw the model numbering scheme for what it was - an attempt to disguise AMD's clock speed disadvantage compared to the P4. It did, however, make some consumers wary of the idea that Intel's high clockspeeds did not necessarily yield superior performance over the Athlon XP. This definition began to be applied more loosely over time as AMD struggled to compete with the ramping clock speeds of the Northwood core (&gt;3.0 GHz). The credibility of the scheme was only saved by the arrival of the K8, where model numbers once again correlated more reasonably to actual performance.

== AMD64 / K8 ==
The K8 is a major revision of the K7 architecture, with the most notable features being the addition of a 64 bit extension to the x86-64 instruction set (called [[AMD64]]), incorporating an on-chip memory controller, and the implementation of an extremely high performance point to point multiprocessor capable interconnect called [[HyperTransport]].  The extension of the x86 to 64 bits was important to AMD, because it marked a true attempt to wrestle the leadership of the x86 standard away from Intel. 

This move by AMD was well timed to take advantage of a product hole in Intel's roadmap, namely a Pentium-compatible CPU that can deal with the inevitable transition to 64 bits.  Some viewed this transition as slightly premature; however it helped AMD to snatch the standard away from Intel and its quality 32-bit backwards compatibility made it a feasible chip even for home users. AMD's standard was adopted by Microsoft, Linux and even Sun Microsystems.  This left Intel in a position where they were forced to make an agreement with AMD to use the AMD64 extensions for their own 64-bit based ([[EM64T]]) processors. The K8 is also notable for its [[Direct Connect Architecture]].

The [[AMD64]] project can be seen as the culmination of Jerry Sanders' &quot;Virtual Gorilla&quot; strategy, in which he set a corporate goal for AMD to become a powerful research corporation in its own right, and not just a low-margin, low-value, commodity clone manufacturer.

The [[Opteron|AMD Opteron]] is the server version of the K8. AMD originally designed the Opteron to compete against Intel's [[IA-64]] [[Itanium]] architecture. But the failure of the [[IA-64]] project to leverage volume sales means it now competes with Intel's [[Xeon]] processor. AMD's technical leadership has considerably improved their credibility, and enabled AMD to make increasing market share inroads into the corporate sector.

On [[April 21]], [[2005]] AMD released the world's first x86 server chip built on [[dual core]] technology, which was in the plans of the K8 line of processors from 2001 onward.  The initial release were accompanied by the availability of the [[Opteron]] 865, 870, and 875 processors, and the 2xx version followed shortly afterwards.

On [[May 31]], [[2005]] AMD released its first desktop-based [[Multi-core (computing)|dual core processor]] family — the [[Athlon 64 X2]].  Unlike Intel's dual-core designs, the X2 mates two cores into a single chip, rather than two chips into a single package.  Intel's method may have theoretical yield advantages, but gives up some performance advantages since interprocessor communication still happens over external pins, rather than internally.  The X2 marks a significant step towards even greater productivity and scalability, especially for multi-threaded software applications.

== Geode ==
In August 2003 AMD also purchased the [[Geode (processor)|Geode]] business (originally the [[Cyrix]] [[MediaGX]]) from [[National Semiconductor]] to augment its existing line of embedded x86 processor products. During the second quarter of 2004, it launched new low-power Geode NX processors based on the K7 Thoroughbred architecture with speeds of 667MHz and 1GHz (fanless), and 1.4GHz (TDP 25W).

== Pacifica ==
AMD's Athlon series of processors are slated to include [[virtualization]] through the [[Pacifica]] technology specification. This technology stands in direct competition to [[Intel]]'s 'Silvervale' virtualization technology.

== Current production ==
AMD's main microprocessor manufacturing and design facilities are located in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]]. Between 2003 and 2005, they constructed a second manufacturing (300mm) plant nearby in order to increase the number of chips they can produce, thus becoming more competitive with [[Intel]]. The new plant has been named &quot;Fab 36&quot;, in recognition of AMD's 36 years of operation, and is expected to reach full production in mid 2006.

As part of its expanding microprocessor design program, AMD started an  engineering design center in [[Bangalore]]. The AMD India Engineering Centre Private Limited, which is started in July, will contribute to the design of future generations of AMD microprocessors. The standalone facility will occupy approximately 38,000 square feet (3,500 m&amp;sup2;) and is located in Richmond Road, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.

== Partnerships ==
[[Image:NVIDIA logo.png|right|150px|NVIDIA Logo]]
AMD continues to use industry partnerships as a means to counter Intel's superior financial resources. Notably [[nVidia]]'s [[nForce2]] chipset generated substantial revenues for nVidia as a popular enthusiast part.

[[HyperTransport]] is a point to point interconnect standard developed by AMD and Alpha Processor Incorporated, and then turned over to an industry standards body for finalization. It is used in the [[nForce3]] and [[nForce4]] chipsets. While not intended as a revenue-generating product line for AMD, by providing technological leadership, AMD enhances its standing within the computer industry. Again, innovation is key to AMD's &quot;Virtual Gorilla&quot; corporate strategy.

AMD has also formed a strategic partnership with IBM, under which AMD gained [[silicon on insulator]] (SOI) manufacturing technology, and detailed advice on 90-nm implementation. IBM holds many patents on SOI technology, and Intel is reluctant to implement the process for this reason, despite the significant reductions in power consumption offered.

AMD is also loosely partnered with end-user companies such as [[HP]], [[Compaq]], [[Asus]], [[Alienware]], [[Acer (company)|ACER]], [[Evesham Technology]] and several others in the area of processor distribution.  Due to recent events regarding the lawsuit filed against Intel, AMD has gained a significant amount of marketshare hold in the end-user market.

Unlike some other companies, AMD provided the technical details required for the open source BIOS project [[LinuxBIOS]] [http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/free-bios.html].

== Flash technology ==
While less visible to the general public than its CPU business, AMD is also a global leader in [[flash memory]]. To compete with [[Intel]], AMD established a 50-50 partnership with [[Fujitsu]] called [[FASL]] in 1993, with manufacturing facilities in [[Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima|Aizu-Wakamatsu]], [[Japan]]. In 2003 the long-term partnership was merged into a new company called [[FASL LLC]], globally branded as [[Spansion]][http://www.spansion.com/], headquartered in [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], [[California]], [[United States|USA]]. Under the deal, AMD took a 60 percent stake, Fujitsu 40 percent.   Spansion has recently been spun off into its own IPO where AMD now owns only about 37% of the company.

The new company sells flash memory products through AMD and Fujitsu and their respective sales forces. Notable product families include Mirrorbit flash. In periods the flash business has been extremely profitable, exceeding the financial performance of the CPU division, although the industry is somewhat prone to boom-bust cycles. AMD / Spansion claim a number of important milestones in Flash development [http://www.spansion.com/about/timeline.html].

== Lawsuits against Intel Corporation ==
AMD has a long history of litigation with former partner and x86 creator [[Intel]].  In 2005, following an investigation, the Japan Federal Trade Commission found Intel guilty of antitrust violations. On [[June 27]] [[2005]], AMD won an [[antitrust]] suit against Intel in [[Japan]], and on the same day, AMD filed a broad antitrust complaint against Intel in the U.S. Federal District Court in [[Delaware]].  The complaint alleges systematic use of secret rebates, special discounts, threats, and other means used by Intel to lock AMD processors out of the global market.

'''Albrecht Dürer''' ([[May 21]], [[1471]] – [[April 6]], [[1528]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[painter]], [[wood carver]], [[engraver]], and [[mathematician]]. Born in [[Nuremberg, Germany|Nuremberg]], [[Germany]], he is best known for his [[woodcuts]] in series, including the ''Apocalypse'' (1498), two series on the crucifixion of Christ, the ''Great Passion'' (1498-1510) and the ''Little Passion'' (1510-1511) as well as many of his individual prints, such as ''[[Knight, Death, and the Devil]]'' (1513), ''[[Saint Jerome in his Study]]'' (1514) and ''[[Melancholia I]]'' (1514). His ''[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'' (1497-1498), part of the ''Apocalypse'' series, is also celebrated. He is also known for his numerous self-portraits.

==First visit to Italy==

On [[July 7]], [[1494]] Dürer was married, according to an arrangement made during his absence, to Agnes Frey, the daughter of a local merchant. His relationship with his wife is unclear and her reputation has suffered from a posthumous assault by Dürer's friends. He did not remain in Nuremberg long; in the autumn of 1494 he travelled to [[Italy]], leaving his wife at Nuremberg. He went to [[Venice]], evidence of his travels being derived from drawings and engravings that are closely linked to existing northern Italian works by [[Mantegna]], [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], [[Lorenzo di Credi]] and others. Some time in 1495 Dürer must have returned to Nuremberg, where he seems to have lived and worked for possibly the next ten years, producing most of his notable prints.

==Return to Nuremberg==

During the first few years from 1495 onwards he worked in the established Germanic and northern forms but was open to the influences of the [[Renaissance]]. His best works in this period were for wood-block printing, typical scenes of popular devotion developed into his famous series of sixteen great designs for the ''Apocalypse'', first carved in [[1498]]. Counterpointed with the first seven of scenes of the ''Great Passion'' in the same year, and a little later a series of eleven on the Holy Family and of saints. Around 1504-1505 he carved the first seventeen of a set illustrating the life of the Virgin. Neither these nor the ''Great Passion'' were published till several years later.

Dürer trained himself in the more finely detailed and expensive copper-engraving. He attempted no subjects of the scale of his woodcuts, but produced a number of [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]s, single figures from scripture or of the saints, some nude mythologies, and groups, sometimes satirical, of ordinary people. The Venetian artist [[Jacopo de Barbari]], whom Dürer had met in Venice, came to Nuremberg for a while in 1500. He influenced Dürer with the new developments in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], [[anatomy]] and [[Body_proportions|proportion]], from which Dürer began his own studies. A series of extant drawings show Dürer's experiments in human proportion, up to the famous engraving of ''[[Adam and Eve]]'' (1504) which showed his firm and detailed grasp of landscape had extended into the quality of flesh surfaces by the subtlest use of the graving-tool known to him. Two or three other technical masterpieces were produced up to 1505, when he made a second visit to Italy.

==Second visit to Italy==

In Italy he turned his hand to painting, at first producing a series of works by [[tempera-painting]] on [[linen]], including portraits and altarpieces, notably the [[Paumgartner]] [[altarpiece]] and the ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]''. In early 1506, he returned to Venice, and stayed there until the spring of 1507. The occasion of this journey has been erroneously stated by [[Vasari]]. Dürer's engravings had by this time attained great popularity and had begun to be copied. In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of [[St. Bartholomew]]. The picture painted by Dürer was closer to the Italian style - the ''Adoration of the Virgin'', also known as the ''Feast of Rose Garlands''; it was subsequently acquired by the Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] and taken to [[Prague]]. Other paintings Dürer produced in Venice include ''The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch'', a ''Christ disputing with the Doctors'' (apparently produced in a mere five days) and a number of smaller works.

[[Image:Hase.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''A Young Hare'', 1502, Watercolor]]

==Nuremberg and the masterworks==
[[Image:Durer Adam and Eve.jpg|thumb|250px|''Adam and Eve'', 1507, Oil on Panel]]

Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians, Dürer was back in Nuremberg by mid-1507. He remained in Germany until 1520. His reputation spread all over [[Europe]]. He was on terms of friendship or friendly communication with all the masters of the age, and [[Raphael]] held himself honored in exchanging drawings with Dürer.

The years between his return from Venice and his journey to the [[Netherlands]] are commonly divided according to the type of work with which he was principally occupied. The first five years, 1507-1511, are pre-eminently the painting years of his life. In them, working with a vast number of preliminary drawings and studies, he produced what have been accounted his four best works in painting - ''Adam and Eve'' (1507), ''Virgin with the Iris'' (1508), the altarpiece the ''Assumption of the Virgin'' (1509), and the ''Adoration of the Trinity by all the Saints'' ([[1511]]). During this period he also completed the two woodcut series of the ''Great Passion'' and the ''Life of the Virgin'', both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the ''Apocalypse'' series.

From 1511 to 1514, Dürer concentrated on engraving, both on [[wood]] and [[copper]], but especially the latter. The major work he produced in this period was the thirty-seven subjects of the ''Little Passion'' on wood, published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small copper-engravings on the same theme in 1512. In 1513 and 1514 appeared the three most famous of Dürer's works in copper-engraving, ''The Knight, Death, and the Devil'' (or simply ''The Knight'', as he called it, 1513), ''Melancholia I'' and ''St. Jerome in his Study'' (both 1514).

In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works. Tempera on linen portraits in 1516. Engravings on many subjects, experiments in etching on plates of [[iron]] and [[zinc]]. A part of the Triumphal Gate and the Triumphal March for the Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]]. He also did the marginal decorations for the Emperor's [[prayer-book]] and a portrait-drawing of the Emperor shortly before his death in 1519.

==Journey to the Netherlands and beyond==
[[Image:chris.png|right|250px|thumb|St. Christopher, by [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
In the summer of 1520 the desire of Dürer to secure new [[patronage]] following the death of Maximilian and an outbreak of sickness in Nuremberg, gave occasion to his fourth and last journey. Together with his wife and her maid he set out in July for the Netherlands in order to be present at the coronation of the new Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. He journeyed by the [[Rhine]] to [[Cologne]], and then to [[Antwerp]], where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in [[silverpoint]], [[chalk]] or [[charcoal]]. Besides going to [[Aachen]] for the [[coronation]], he made excursions to Cologne, [[Nijmwegen]], [['s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Brussels]], [[Bruges]], [[Ghent]] and [[Zeeland]]. He finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness which afflicted him for the rest of his life.

==Final years in Nuremberg==
[[Image:AlbrechtDürer01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The title page of ''Vier Bücher von menschlicher Proportion'' (''Four Books of Human Proportion'', 1528), which features his famous signature.]]

Back in Nuremberg, Dürer began work on a series of religious pictures. Many preliminary sketches and studies survive, but no paintings on the grand scale were ever carried out. This was due in part to his declining health, but more because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on [[geometry]] and perspective, proportion and [[fortification]]. Though having little natural gift for writing, he worked hard to produce his works. 

The consequence of this shift in emphasis was that in the last years of his life Dürer produced, as an artist, comparatively little. In painting there was a portrait of [[commons:Image:Albrecht Dürer 035.jpg|Hieronymus Holtzschuher]], a [[commons:Image:Albrecht Dürer 061.jpg|''Madonna and Child'' (1526)]] and two panels showing [[John the Apostle|St. John]] with [[St. Peter]] in [[commons:Image:Albrecht Dürer 026.jpg|front]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] with [[St. Mark]] in the [[commons:Image:Albrecht Dürer 027.jpg|background]]. In copper-engraving Dürer produced only a number of portraits, those of the cardinal-elector of Mainz (''The Great Cardinal''), [[Frederick the Wise]], elector of Saxony, and his friends the [[humanist]] scholar [[Willibald Pirckheimer]], [[Philipp Melanchthon]] and [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]].

Of his books, Dürer succeeded in getting two finished and produced during his lifetime. One on geometry and perspective (''[[The Painter's Manual]]''), which was published at Nuremberg in 1525, and one on fortification, published in 1527. His work on human proportion was brought out shortly after his death in 1528 at the age of 56.

'''Australian football''', which is also known as '''Australian rules football''', or less formally as &quot;'''Aussie rules'''&quot; or simply as &quot;'''footy'''&quot; is a code of [[football]] which originated in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].

The game is played between two teams of 18 players (plus ''[[interchange (Australian rules football)|interchange]]'' players), on [[cricket]] ''[[oval]]s'' or similar-sized grassed arenas which vary in size and may be up to 185 [[metre]]s (200 [[yard]]s) long; these are much larger than those used by other codes of football. The game is also distinguished from other games by the fast, relatively free movement of the ball (partly due to the absence of an [[Offside law (football)|offside rule]]) and the awarding of a ''free kick'' for any clean catch – known as a ''[[Mark (Australian football) | mark]]'' – of a ball which has been kicked more than 15 metres. Spectacular high ''marks'', or &quot;[[specky|speccies]]&quot;, tackles and fast, fluid play are the game's main attributes as a spectator sport. Despite the game's sometimes rough physical nature players do not usually wear protective clothing. Although it is a [[winter]] sport, pre-season competitions usually begin in late February (that is, in the Australian summer); the ''football season'' proper is from March to August, with finals being held in September.

==Structure and competitions ==
The most powerful organisation and competition within the game is the elite, [[professional sport|professional]], [[Australian Football League]] (AFL). There are also seven state (and/or territory)-based organisations: [[AFL NSW/ACT]], [[Football Tasmania]], the [[Northern Territory Football League]], the [[South Australian National Football League]] (SANFL), the [[Queensland Australian Football League]], the [[Victorian Football League]] (VFL), and the [[West Australian Football League]] (WAFL). Most of these hold annual semi-professional club competitions, while the others oversee more than one league. Local semi-professional or amateur organisations and competitions are also affiliated to these state leagues.

Unlike most [[Football (soccer)|soccer]] competitions, there are usually no separate &quot;league&quot; and &quot;cup&quot; trophies. In the [[Australian Football League|AFL]], The McClelland Trophy is awarded to the team that finishes the league in first position (sometimes called the minor premiership), but this is not afforded a high level of prestige as the major objective is the Premiership. The teams that occupy the highest positions (usually four in most amateur leagues, but eight in the AFL) play off in a &quot;semi-knockout&quot; finals series (in the AFL, the top four sides get a second chance if they lose their first final), with the two successful teams meeting in the [[Grand Final]] to contest the ''premiership''. The winner is awarded the ''premiership cup''.

==Rules of the game==
{{main|Laws of Australian Football}}
[[Image:Sherrin.png|thumb|right|150px|An Australian [[football (ball)|football]]. The [[Sherrin]] brand is used for all official AFL matches, whilst the [[Burley football|Burley]] brand is endorsed by many state leagues and other countries.]]

Both the ball and the field of play are [[ellipsoid|oval]] in shape.  No more than 18 players of each team are permitted to be on the field at any time. Up to four ''interchange'' (reserve) players may be swapped for those on the field at any time during the game. There is no offside rule nor are there set positions in the rules - unlike many other forms of football, players from both teams disperse across the whole field before the start of play. The ball can be propelled in any direction by way of a foot, clenched fist (called a [[handball (Australian Rules Football) | handball]] or ''handpass'') or open hand tap, but it cannot be thrown under any circumstances. (Throwing is defined in the rules quite broadly.)

A player may run with the ball but it must be bounced or touched on the ground at least every 15 metres. Opposition players may [[bump (football)|bump]] or [[tackle (football)|tackle]] the player to obtain the ball, and when tackled, the player must dispose of the ball cleanly or risk being penalised for ''holding the ball''.

If a player takes possession of the ball that has travelled more than 15 metres from another player's kick (there are different styles of kicking, mainly revolving around how the ball is held in the hand, of which [[punt (football)|punt]] or [[drop punt]] are two) by way of a catch, it is claimed as a ''[[mark (Australian football)|mark]]'' and that player may then have a ''free kick'' (meaning that that the game stops while he prepares to kick from the point at which he marked).  Apart from free kicks, or when the ball is in the possession of umpires for a ball up or throw in, the ball is always in dispute and any player from either side can take possession of the ball.

===Scoring===
At each end of the field are four vertical posts. The middle two are the ''goal posts'', and the two on either side, which are shorter, are the ''behind posts''. A goal is scored when the football is propelled through the goal posts at any height (including above the height of the posts) by way of a kick from the attacking team. It may fly through on the full or bounce through, as long as it is not touched by any player from either team.  A goal cannot be scored from the foot of an opposition (defending) player. A behind is scored when the ball goes across the line between a goal post and a behind post, or if the ball hits a goal post or is touched (a ''rushed behind'') before passing between the goalposts. A goal is worth 6 points, whereas a behind is worth one.

The team that scores the most points at the end of play wins the game.  Thus a score of 10 goals and 10 behinds equals 70 points.  A score of 9 goals and 18 behinds equals 72 points.  The latter score would win the game despite the fact that that team scored one goal less. The result would usually be written as

'''Team A 9.18 (72)''' def Team B 10.10 (70).

==History==
===Origins of the game===
[[Tom Wills]] began to devise Australian rules in [[Melbourne]], in 1858. (Although [[H.C.A. Harrison]], Wills' cousin, was also named much later as an official &quot;father of the game&quot;, his role does not now seem to have been significant at this very early stage.) A letter by Wills was published in ''Bell's Life in Victoria &amp; Sporting Chronicle'' on [[July 10]], [[1858]],[http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&amp;articleid=37] calling for a &quot;foot-ball club&quot; with a &quot;code of laws&quot; to keep cricketers fit during winter. An experimental match, played by Wills and others at the Richmond Paddock (later known as [[Yarra Park]], next to the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]) on [[July 31]], [[1858]], was probably the first game of Australian football. However, few details of the match have survived.

On [[August 7]], [[1858]], two significant events in the development of the game occurred: the [[Melbourne Football Club]] was founded, one of the world's [[first football club]]s in any code, and a famous match between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]] began, umpired by Wills. A second day of play took place on August 21, and a third and final day on September 4. The two schools have competed annually ever since. However, the rules used by the two teams in 1858 could not have had much in common with the eventual form of Australian football, since Wills had not yet begun to write them..

[[Image:Australianfootball1866.jpg|thumb|290px|A game at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]] in the [[1860s]]. A pavilion at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] is on the left in the background. (A [[wood engraving]] made by Robert Bruce on July 27, 1866.)]]
The Melbourne Football Club rules of 1859 are the oldest surviving set of laws for Australian football. They were drawn up at the Parade Hotel, [[East Melbourne]] on [[May 17]], by Wills, W. J. Hammersley, J. B. Thompson and Thomas Smith (some sources include H. C. A. Harrison). The 1859 rules did not include some elements which soon became important to the game, such as the requirement to bounce the ball while running, and Melbourne's game was not immediately adopted by neighbouring clubs. Before each match, the rules had to be agreed by the two teams involved. By 1866, however, several other clubs had agreed to play by an updated version of Melbourne's rules.

It is often said that the founders were partly inspired by the ball games of the local [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] people in western Victoria. Aborigines did play a sport called ''[[Marn Grook]]'', which used a ball made out of [[possum]] hide, and included play resembling the ''high marking'' (&quot;speccie&quot;) in Australian football. There is considerable debate over the connection between the two. Wills did have a deep knowledge of Aboriginal culture, and Harrison had grown up in an area near present day [[Moyston, Victoria]] where he may have seen Marn Grook.

The influence of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[public school]] and [[university]] football codes, while also undetermined, was clearly substantial. Wills had been educated at [[Rugby School]] in England (where [[Rugby football]] had been codified since 1845). Wills had also, like W. J. Hammersley and J. B. Thompson, been to the [[University of Cambridge]]. The [[Cambridge Rules]], drawn up in 1848, included some elements which are important in Australian football, such as the mark. Thomas Smith was [[Ireland|Irish]] and had attended [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where the Rugby School rules were popular at a very early stage. These men would have been familiar with other public school and university games. They may also have been inspired by surviving forms of [[Medieval football]] and other traditional sports, played among the thousands of immigrants who poured into Victoria from the UK, Ireland and many other countries during the gold rushes of the [[1850s]].

===Similarities to Gaelic football===
While it is clear even to casual observers that Australian rules football is similar to [[Gaelic football]], the exact relationship is unclear, as the Irish game was not codified by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) until 1887. The historian B. W. O'Dwyer points out that Australian football has always been differentiated from [[rugby football]] by having no limitation on ball or player movement (in the absence of an offside rule), the need to bounce the ball (or toe-kick it, known as a ''solo'' in Gaelic football) while running, punching the ball (hand-passing) rather than throwing it, and other traditions. As O'Dwyer says:
:''These are all elements of Irish football. There were several variations of Irish football in existence, normally without the benefit of rulebooks, but the central tradition in [[Ireland]] was in the direction of the relatively new game [i.e. rugby]...adapted and shaped within the perimeters of the ancient Irish game of [[hurling]]... [These rules] later became embedded in Gaelic football. Their presence in Victorian football may be accounted for in terms of a formative influence being exerted by men familiar with and no doubt playing the Irish game. It is not that they were introduced into the game from that motive [i.e. emulating Irish games]; it was rather a case of particular needs being met...'' [B. W. O'Dwyer, March 1989, &quot;The Shaping of Victorian Rules Football&quot;, ''Victorian Historical Journal'', v.60, no.1.]
After 1887, the two games developed in isolation from each other. A number of players, most notably [[Jim Stynes]] have successfully made the transition from Gaelic football to Australian rules.

====International rules football====
{{main|International rules football}}

Since 1967, there have been many matches between Australian and Irish teams, under various sets of hybrid, compromise rules. In 1984, the first official representative matches of [[International Rules football]] were played, and these are now played annually each October.

In 1999, a record Australian International Rules crowd of 65,000 at the [[MCG]] attended a game that saw Ireland defeat Australia but Australia win the series. In 2002, a record Irish International Rules crowd of 71,532 at [[Croke Park]], [[Dublin]] witnessed a draw which also saw Australia win the series.

The rules are a compromise between the two codes, using the round ball and the rectangular field of Gaelic football. The fierce tackling of the Australian code is allowed, although this has often caused controversy with the Irish players, who play a mostly non-contact game.

===History of clubs and competitions===
The modern day [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) has many teams dating back to the beginnings of the game: apart from the Melbourne Football Club, other early clubs still in existence include: [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] ([[1860]]), [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] ([[1864]]), North Melbourne (aka Hotham, now [[Kangaroos Football Club|Kangaroos]]) ([[1869]]), [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] ([[1870]]), [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] ([[1873]]), South Melbourne (now [[Sydney Swans]]) ([[1874]]) and Footscray (now the [[Western Bulldogs]]) ([[1877]]).

===The first league===
In 1877, the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA), the game's first league, was formed by 14 clubs: Albert Park, Ballarat, Barwon, Beechworth, Carlton, Castlemaine, East Melbourne, Essendon, Geelong, Hotham (later North Melbourne), Inglewood, Melbourne, Rochester and St Kilda. Six of these clubs were from the Victorian country. At the time, Essendon was regarded as a semi-junior club rather than a full member, and was allowed concessions such as fielding teams of 25 players, instead of the standard 20.

===Leagues outside Victoria===
Gradually the game – known at first  as &quot;Melbourne Rules&quot;,  &quot;Victorian Rules or sometimes as &quot;Australasian Rules&quot; – spread from Victoria into other Australian colonies, especially [[South Australia]] (SA), [[Tasmania]] and [[Western Australia]] (WA). The first [[interstate matches in Australian rules football|intercolonial match]], between Victoria and SA, was held in 1879.

Competitions also began in [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]] in the 1880s. In [[Newcastle, New South Wales]] the Black Diamond league was founded by Victorian goldminers and the [[Black Diamond Challenge Cup]] remains Australia's oldest sporting trophy.

The precursors of the [[South Australian National Football League]] (SANFL) and the [[West Australian Football League]] (WAFL) were strong, separate competitions by the 1890s.

The game also spread to New Zealand in 1876, and grew to a formidable league of 115 clubs.  In 1908, New Zealand defeated both New South Wales and Queensland at the [[Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival]], an event held to celebrate 50 years of Australian Football.  The game was also introduced to England, Scotland and Japan. 

The outbreak of [[World War I]] signalled a hiatus in the game overseas in all countries but Australia (which lasted until the late 1980s), whilst factors such as interstate rivalry and the denial of access to grounds in Sydney caused the code to struggle in New South Wales and Queensland.[http://www.convictcreations.com/football/evolution.htm]

===Formation of the VFL===
A rift in the VFA led to the formation of the [[Victorian Football League]] (VFL), which commenced play in 1897 as an eight-team breakaway of the stronger clubs in the VFA competition: Carlton, [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], Essendon, [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]], Geelong, Melbourne, St Kilda and South Melbourne.

Another five VFA clubs joined the VFL later: [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] and [[University Football Club|University]] joined the VFL in 1908, although University withdrew in 1915. Footscray, [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and North Melbourne joined in 1925, by which time VFL had become the most prominent league in the game.

===Interstate competition===
{{main|Interstate matches in Australian rules football}}
For most of the 20th century, the absence of a national club competition – and the inability of players to compete internationally – meant that matches between state representative teams were regarded with great importance. Because VFL clubs increasingly recruited the best players in other states, Victoria dominated these games. However, [[State of Origin]] rules were introduced in 1977, and in the first such game, at [[Subiaco Oval]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Western Australia defeated Victoria, 23.13 (151) to 8.9 (57), a huge reversal of the results in most previous games. Western Australia and South Australia began to win many of their games against Victoria. However, during the 1990s, following the emergence of the Australian Football League,  state of origin games declined in importance especially after an increasing number of withdrawals by AFL players, who were under increasing pressure from clubs concerned by the risk of injuries. Australian football State of Origin matches ceased in 1999. The second-tier state and territorial leagues still contest interstate matches.

===A national league===
In 1982, in a move which heralded big changes within the sport, one of the original VFL clubs, [[South Melbourne Football Club]], relocated to the [[Rugby League]] stronghold of [[Sydney]] and became known as the [[Sydney Swans]]. In the late 1980s, strong interstate interest in the VFL led to a more national competition; two more non-Victorian clubs, the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the [[Brisbane Bears Football Club|Brisbane Bears]] began playing in 1987.

The league changed its name to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) following the 1989 season. In 1991, it gained its first South Australian team, [[Adelaide Crows|Adelaide]]. West Coast's [[local derby]] rival [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] was admitted in 1995. Fitzroy merged with Brisbane after 1996 due to financial difficulties to form the [[Brisbane Lions]] and the proud old SANFL club, [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] joined in 1997, immediately becoming fierce local rivals to Adelaide. The AFL, currently with 16 member clubs, is the sport's elite competition.

===Today's state leagues===
For much of the [[20th century]] the SANFL and the WAFL were considered peers of the VFL. Although the VFL was generally accepted as the strongest league, clubs from all three leagues frequently played each other on an even footing in challenge matches and occasional nationwide club competitions.

With the introduction of the AFL, the SANFL, WAFL and other state leagues rapidly declined to a secondary status. Apart from these there are many semi-professional and amateur leagues around Australia, where they play a very important role in the community, and particularly so in rural areas.

The VFA, still in existence a century after the original schism, merged with the former VFL reserves competition in 1998. The new entity adopted the VFL name.

===Traditions of the game===
====Gameday Traditions====
[[Image:Footybanner.jpg|thumb|250px|A banner for [[Essendon Football Club]]]]
At the elite level, the game still retains some links to its suburban roots. At the start of each game, AFL players run on to the field through a [[paper | crêpe paper]] banner depicting some message (for instance, congratulating players on a milestone number of games) constructed by volunteer supporter groups.

Games begin by [[tossing a coin]], for the winning captain to select the end of the field of their goal for the first quarter.  Unlike other forms of football, Australian football begins similarly to [[basketball]]. After the first [[siren]], the [[umpire]] bounces the ball on the ground, and the two [[ruckman|ruckmen]] (typically the tallest man from the each team), battle for the ball in the air on its way back down.

All AFL clubs also have a [[fight song|club song]], most of which were composed during the early [[20th century]], or mimic the musical styles of that era (exceptions being the newer teams of West Coast, Fremantle, Port Adelaide and the former [[Brisbane Bears]] each with non-traditional songs). Some teams use club songs set to the tunes of well-known [[United States|American]] marches.  Both teams songs are played as they enter the ground, and the winners song is sung at the end of the game.

The goal umpire signals a goal with 2 hands raised at elbow height, or one for a behind, and then confirms the signal with the other goal umpire by waving flags above his head.
Some traditions change, however, and the goal umpire no longer wears a white coat and broad brimmed hat.

====Supporter Traditions====
''See also [[List of nicknames used in Australian rules]].''

Australian rules is often referred to as the ''people's game'' [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/26/1064083189800.html?from=storyrhs] due to its ability to transcend class and racial boundaries, unify supporters and attract crowds.

Aussie rules fans ''barrack'' for their team rather than support or ''root for'' (in Australia, 'root' is slang for [[sexual intercourse]]).  The term ''barrack'' is believed to have from early matches between soldiers stationed in army barracks near the MCG.  One of the first things many Melburnians will ask when meeting someone new is which team they barrack for.

Typical supporter wear includes the team [[scarf]] and sometimes [[beanie]] (mostly in the cooler states) in the colours of the team.  These traditions originated from Melbourne where winters are colder than in most other parts of Australia. Team flags are sometimes flown by supporters, and official club cheersquads behind the goals will sometimes wave enormous coloured [[pompon]]s konwn as ''floggers'' after the umpire has signalled a goal.

[[Meat pie]]s and [[beer]] are the popular consumables for supporters at Australian rules matches. Mobile vendors walk around the ground selling such items (except for beer, as liquor licensing laws would not allow this), yelling out the well known call of &quot;hot pies, cold drinks!&quot;

At the end of the match, it is traditional for a ''[[pitch invasion]]'' where supporters run onto the field to celebrate the game and play games of kick-to-kick with their families.  In recent years, this has been more strictly controlled with [[security guards]] to ensure that players and officials can safely leave the ground.  Sometimes a mid-game ''pitch invasion'' is expected for various landmark achievements, such as a player kicking a record number of goals and players are protected by bodyguards.

==Popularity==
Australian rules football has attracted more overall interest among Australians than any other winter sport for at least several years.[http://www.sweeneyresearch.com.au/PDF/Interest.pdf][http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/22/1053196670542.html] 
A recent survey has suggested that the sport recently took over from [[swimming]] as the most popular sport in Australia [http://www.thesundaymail.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5936,17792967%255E23211,00.html].  

It is popular in two countries which are former Australian territories: [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Nauru]].

[[Cricket]] is the most common summer spectator sport in Australia, and is usually played on the same grounds as Australian football. In the past, many elite-level footballers also played representative cricket, but the increasingly professional nature of the game made this impossible by the [[1980s]].

Australian rules is the most popular form of football in the [[Northern Territory]] (NT), [[South Australia]] (SA), [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] (WA). In [[New South Wales]] (NSW) and [[Queensland]] overall, [[rugby league]] is the predominant winter sport. In the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) [[rugby union]] is arguably more popular. However, in both the ACT and south-western NSW, Australian football has rivalled the two varieties of rugby in popularity over many decades. In addition, ongoing net migration from Victoria, SA and Tasmania to Queensland and NSW, the winning of AFL premierships by teams in those states and the consequent growth of amateur football, means that the [[demography|demographics]] of Australian football are changing.

In recent years, Australian rules has become increasingly popular in Brisbane, undoubtedly due to the recent success of the [[Brisbane Lions]], who won three premierships in a row (2001-2003) and finished runner-up in 2004. Popularity in Sydney has increased since the [[Sydney Swans]] made their first Grand Final appearance in 1996.  In 2005, the team won their first premiership since relocating to Sydney in 1982, and the club's first since 1933 (as the [[South Melbourne Swans]]).  The increasing marketshare in these states has boosted the national popularity of the code.

===Audience===

====Attendance====
Australian football is the most highly attended spectator sport in Australia: government figures show that more than 2.5 million people (16.8% of the population) attended games in 1999 [http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/e298cee24565c911ca256def007248ff?OpenDocument]. In 2005, 6,283,788 people attended [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) premiership matches [http://www.smh.com.au/news/Sport/Aussie-Rules-sets-attendance-record/2005/08/28/1125167544791.html], a record for the competition. A further 307,181 attended [[NAB Cup]] pre-season matches and 117,552 attended Regional Challenge pre-season practice matches around the country [http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:QSxF-7E66dcJ:afl.com.au/default.asp%3Fpg%3Dwizardcup%26spg%3Ddisplay%26articleid%3D190187].  

As well as the AFL attendances, strong state competitions also drew crowds.  Although crowds for local leagues have suffered since the national competition, they continue to draw support, particularly for finals matches.  The South Australian [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]] drew an attendance of 303,354 in 2005, the Western Australian [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] drew an official attendance of 202,797 in 2004 and the Victorian [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] (including a Tasmanian side, the [[Tasmanian Devils|Devils]]) also drew strong crowds (but with no available attendance figures).

As of 2005 the AFL is one of only five professional sports leagues in the world with an average [[Sports attendance|attendance]] above thirty thousand (the others are [[NFL]] and [[Major League Baseball]] in the United States, and the top division soccer leagues in [[Bundesliga (football)|Germany]], and [[FA Premier League|England]]).

====Attendance records====
{{main|Australian rules football attendance records}}
The record attendance for a single game was 121,696 at the 1970  VFL Grand Final, between Carlton and Collingwood, at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. The record for a game outside Victoria was the 72,393 who attended a game between Sydney and Collingwood at [[Telstra Stadium]], [[Sydney]] in 2003. The record attendance for a non AFL/VFL match is 66,897 at the 1976 [[SANFL]] Grand Final, played between Sturt and Port Adelaide at [[Football Park]], [[Adelaide]]. The record for [[State of Origin]] representative games was 91,960 for [[Victoria, Australia | Victoria]] v. [[South Australia]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground | MCG]] in 1989. The record for a game outside Australia was 32,789 at an [[Australian Football Exhibition Match|exhibition match]] between Melbourne and Sydney at [[B.C. Place]], [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]] in 1987.

====Television====
The 2005 [[AFL Grand Final]] was watched by a television audience of more than 3.3 million people across five of Australia's most highly populated cities, including 1.2 million in Melbourne and 991,000 in [[Sydney]].[http://www.oztam.com.au/documents/2005/E_20050918.pdf]

Since Australian national television ratings were compiled in 2002, the AFL Grand Final has reached the top 5 of Australian programmes in  [[List of Australian television ratings for 2002|2002]], [[List of Australian television ratings for 2003|2003]], [[List of Australian television ratings for 2004|2004]] and [[List of Australian television ratings for 2005|2005]].  Australian rules football has achieved a #1 rating in the sports category in both [[List of Australian television ratings for 2004|2004]] and [[List of Australian television ratings for 2005|2005]].

===Participation===
With more than 400,000 participants, Australian football is also one of the most-played team sports in Australia. [http://www.ausport.gov.au/scorsresearch/table8ERASS2003.pdf] South Australia is said to be the state with the highest participation rate for people taking part in Australian football, with over 2.2% of the population aged 18 years and over participating in the sport [http://www.ausport.gov.au/fulltext/2000/ascpub/pdf/australian%20rules%20football%202.pdf], while the [[Tiwi Islands]] is said to have the highest participation rate in Australia (35%) [http://www.theage.com.au/news/northern-territory/even-a-cyclone-cant-stop-the-footy/2005/03/19/1111086063413.html].  

Australian football is also now played as an amateur sport in more than 20 countries around the world. (See [[Australian football around the world]]).

Many related games have emerged from Aussie Rules, mainly with variations of contact, including [[Auskick]], [[Rec Footy]], [[Women's Footy]], [[9-a-side Footy]] and [[Masters Australian Football]].  Players outside of Australia also engage in related games such as [[Metro Footy]] and [[Samoa Rules]] based on available fields.

===Australian football internationally===
{{main|Australian football around the world}}

Australian football is a major spectator sport only in [[Australia]] and [[Nauru]], although occasional [[Australian Football Exhibition Match |exhibition games]] are staged in other countries. However, amateur competition has grown in countries such as [[New Zealand]], [[Ireland]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] the [[United States|USA]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Samoa]], [[China]], [[South Africa]], [[Tonga]] and [[Indonesia]], since the late [[1980s]]. Many of these were initially established by Australian expatriates but collecting growing numbers of native players. The largest such competition is the [[Ontario Australian Football League]], in Canada, with 12 teams scheduled to compete in 2006. There are now youth development programs in several of these countries; since 1998, the [[Barassi International Australian Football Youth Tournament]], endorsed by the AFL as part of its International Policy, has hosted several of junior teams from other countries.

Australian football is not yet large enough internationally for a [[FIFA]]-style governing body, so the AFL is primarily responsible for funding and governance and provides around [[Australian dollar|A$]]500,000 annually for international development, especially junior programs.

The [[Arafura Games]], held in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Northern Territory]], [[Australia]] is a [[Multi-sport event]] for [[South East Asia]] and [[East Asia]]n island nations, northern Australia and the [[Pacific Islands]] which has Australian football as a permanent competition sport, rather than a [[demonstration sport]]. Papua New Guinea won the [[gold medal]] and retained it in subsequent games. Other teams that have competed at Australian Rules in the games include Japan, Nauru and a Northern Territory [[indigenous]] team.

The [[International Australian Football Council]] (IAFC) was formed after the 1995 Arafura Games. Following internal divisions in the IAFC, another organisation, [[Aussie Rules International]] was set up in [[London]].

Inspired by successful Arafura Games competitions, the inaugural [[Australian Football International Cup]] was held in Melbourne in 2002, an initiative of the newly formed IAFC. The 2002 cup was contested by 11 teams from around the world made up exclusively of non-Australians. [[Ireland]] won the 2002 cup, defeating [[Papua New Guinea]] in the final.

==Australian Football Hall of Fame==

:''Main article: [[Australian Football Hall of Fame]].''

For the centenary of the VFL/AFL in 1996, an [[Australian Football Hall of Fame]] was established. That year 136 identities were inducted, including 100 players, 10 coaches, 10 umpires, 10 administrators and 6 media representatives.

The selections have caused some controversy, partly because of the predominance of VFL players at the expense of those who played in other leagues, in the years before there was a national competition. [[Gary Ablett]]'s induction was deferred for several years until 2005 due to a controversy associated with the death of a young woman acquaintance shortly after his retirement, which was felt to be likely to bring the Hall into disrepute.

The elite ''Legend'' status was bestowed on 12 members of the Hall of Fame in 1996; seven other football identities have subsequently received this honour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alban Maria Johannes Berg''' ([[February 9]], [[1885]] &amp;ndash; [[December 24]], [[1935]]) was an [[Austria]]n [[composer]]. He was a member of the [[Second Viennese School]] along with [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Anton Webern]], producing works that combined [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]ian [[romantic music|romanticism]] with a highly personal adaptation of Schoenberg's [[twelve-tone technique]].

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:alban_berg.jpg|framed|right|Inset of portrait of Berg by [[Arnold Schoenberg]].]] --&gt;

==Life and work==
Berg was born in [[Vienna]], the third of four children of Johanna and Conrad Berg. His family lived quite comfortably until the death of his father in [[1900]]. 

He was more interested in [[literature]] than [[music]] as a child, and did not begin to compose until he was fifteen, when he started to teach himself music. He had very little formal music eduction until he began a six-year period of study with Arnold Schoenberg in October [[1904]] to [[1911]], studying [[counterpoint]], [[music theory]], and [[harmony]]; by [[1906]] he concentrated on his music studies full-time, and by [[1907]] he began [[musical composition|composition]] lessons. Among his compositions under Schoenberg were five [[piano sonata]] drafts and various songs, including his ''[[Seven Early Songs (Berg)|Seven Early Songs]]'' (''Sieben frühe Lieder''), three of which were Berg's first publicly performed work in a concert featuring the music of Schoenberg's pupils in Vienna that same year.

These early compositions would reveal Berg's progress as a composer under Schoenberg's tutelage. The early sonata sketches eventually culminated in Berg's [[Piano Sonata (Berg)|Piano Sonata]] (Op.1) (1907&amp;ndash;[[1908|8]]); while considered to be his &quot;graduating composition&quot;, is one of the most formidable initial works ever written by any composer (Lauder, 1986). Schoenberg was a major influence on him throughout his lifetime; Berg not only greatly admired him as a composer and mentor, but they remained close friends for the remainder of his life. Many people believe that Berg also saw him as a surrogate father, considering Berg's young age during his father's death.

An important idea of Schoenberg is his teaching was what would later be known as ''developing variation'', which stated that the unity of a piece is dependent on all aspects of the composition being derived from a single basic idea. Berg would then pass this idea down to one of his students, [[Theodor Adorno]], who stated: &quot;The main principle he conveyed was that of variation: everything was supposed to develop out of something else and yet be intrinsically different.&quot; The Sonata is a striking example of the execution of this idea &amp;mdash; the whole composition can be derived from the opening [[quartal and quintal harmony|quartal]] gesture and from the opening phrase.

Berg was a part of Vienna's cultural elite during the heady period of ''[[fin de siècle]]''. Among his circle included the musicians [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]] and [[Franz Schreker]], painter [[Gustav Klimt]], writer and satirist [[Karl Kraus]], architect [[Adolf Loos]], and poet [[Peter Altenberg]]. In 1906, Berg met [[Helene Nahowski]], singer and daughter of a wealthy family, and despite the outward hostility of her family, married on May 3, 1911.

In [[1913]], two of Berg's ''Five Songs on Picture Postcard Texts by [[Peter Altenberg]]'' (1912) were premiered in Vienna under Schoenberg's baton. The pieces - settings of unpoetic, aphoristic utterances accompanied by a very large orchestra - caused a riot, and the performance had to be halted; the work was not performed in full until [[1952]] (and its full score remained unpublished until 1966). 

From [[1915]] to [[1918]], he served in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian Army]] and it was during a period of leave in [[1917]] that he began work on his first [[opera]], ''[[Wozzeck]]''. Following [[World War I]], he settled again in Vienna where he taught private pupils. He also helped Schoenberg run the [[Society for Private Musical Performances]], which sought to create an ideal environment for the exploration of unappreciated and unfamiliar new music by means of open rehearsals, repeated performances, and the exclusion of all newspaper critics.

The performance in [[1924]] of three excerpts from ''Wozzeck'' brought Berg his first public success.  The opera, which Berg completed in [[1922]], was not performed in its entireity until [[December 14]], [[1925]], when [[Erich Kleiber]] directed a performance in [[Berlin]]. The opera is today seen as one of his most important works; a later opera, the critically acclaimed ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', was left with its third act incomplete at his death.

Berg's best-known piece is probably his elegiac [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]]. Like so much of his mature work, it employs a highly personal adaptation of Schoenberg's [[twelve tone technique]] that enables it to combine frank [[atonality]] with more traditionally tonal passages and harmonies; additionally, it uses actual quotations of pre-existing tonal music, including a [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] chorale and a [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] folk song. The Violin Concerto was dedicated to Manon, the deceased daughter of architect [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Alma Schindler]].

Other well known Berg compositions include the ''[[Lyric Suite]]'' (seemingly a big influence on the String Quartet No. 3 of [[Béla Bartók]]), ''Three Pieces for Orchestra'', and the [[Chamber music|Chamber]] [[Concerto]] for [[violin]], [[piano]] and 13 [[Woodwind instrument|wind]] instruments.

Berg died on Christmas Eve, 1935, in Vienna, apparently from [[blood poisoning]] caused by an insect bite. He was 50 years old.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Analytical chemistry''' is the [[:wikt:analysis|analysis]] of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[structure]].

==Types==
Analytical chemistry can be split into two main types, qualitative and quantitative:
#[[Qualitative inorganic analysis]] seeks to establish the presence of a given [[chemical element|element]] or [[inorganic compound]] in a sample.
#Qualitative organic analysis seeks to establish the presence of a given [[functional group]] or [[organic compound]] in a sample.
#[[Quantitative analysis]] seeks to establish the amount of a given element or compound in a sample.

Most modern analytical chemistry is quantitative. Quantitative analysis can be further split into different areas of study. The material can be analyzed for the amount of an element or for the amount of an element in a specific chemical species. The latter is of particular interest in biological systems; the molecules of life contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and others, in many complex

==Techniques==

There are a bewildering array of techniques available to separate, detect and measure chemical compounds. 

*[[Separation of chemicals]] in order to measure the weight or volume of a final product. This is an older process and can be quite painstaking, but is an essential first step when dealing with certain mixtures of substances, like extracts from organisms. Modern separation techniques such as [[HPLC]] often seek to separate and determine amount or identity in a single automated analysis by integrating a detector.

*[[Titration]] is a technique used to determine amounts present in solution or a physical characteristic of a molecule such as an [[equilibrium]] constant. 

*Analysis of substances with devices using [[spectroscopy]]. By measuring the absorption or emission of light, or other types of [[electromagnetic_spectrum|radiation]], by a substance we can calculate the amounts of species or characterize the chemical species, often without separation. Methods include [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]] (AAS), [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) and [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA).

*[[Mass spectrometry]] is used to determine the [[molecular mass]], the elemental composition, structure and sometimes amount of chemical species in a sample by [[ionize|ionizing]] the analyte molecules and observing their behavior in electric and magnetic fields.

*Many techniques combine two or more analytical methods (sometimes called &quot;hyphenated&quot; or &quot;hybrid&quot; methods). Examples of this include [[ICP-MS]](Inductively-Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry), where [[volatilisation]] of a sample occurs in the first step, and measuring of the concentration occurs in the second. The first step may also involve a separation technique, such as [[chromatography]], and the second a detection / measuring device.

*Techniques that involve volatilisation aim to produce free atoms of the elements making up the sample, which can then be measured in concentration by the degree to which they absorb or emit at a characteristic spectral frequency. These methods have the disadvantage of completely destroying the sample, and any species contained within it. These techniques include [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]] and [[ICP-MS]] / [[ICP-AES]]. These techniques can still be used to study speciation, however by the incorporation of a separation stage before volatilisation.

*Another example of a hybrid technique is Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry [GC/MS], which is primarily used for non-ionic, volatilizable organic compounds. The compounds are separated on a chromatographic column, and introduced directly, or via a specialized interface, to an ionization chamber in a mass spectrometer. The compounds are then ionized (typically by electron impact, or chemical ionization) and accelerated through a carefully controlled electromagnetic field. The time of flight, or the voltage applied at the exact moment of impact is unique for compounds of the same mass. In this manner, the retention time and mass are measured for each compound.

== Methods ==

Analytical methods rely on scrupulous attention to cleanliness, sample preparation, [[accuracy and precision]]. 

Many practitioners will keep all their glassware in acid to prevent contamination, samples will be re-run many times over, and equipment will be washed in specially pure solvents.

A standard method for analysis of concentration involves the creation of a [[calibration curve]]. 

If the concentration of element or compound in a sample is too high for the detection range of the technique, it can simply be diluted in a pure solvent. If the amount in the sample is below an instrument's range of measurement, the method of addition can be used. In this method a known quantity of the element or compound under study is added, and the difference between the concentration added, and the concentration observed is the amount actually in the sample.

== Trends==
Analytical chemistry research is largely driven by performance (sensitivity, selectivity, robustness, linear range, accuracy, precision, and speed), and cost (purchase, operation, training, time, and space).  

A lot of effort is put in shrinking the analysis techniques to [[chip]] size.  Although there are few examples of such systems competitive with traditional analysis techniques, potential advantages include size/portability, speed, and cost. ([[Total Analysis System]] or lab on a chip)

Much effort is also put into analyzing biological systems.  Examples of rapidly expanding fields in this area are:
*Proteomics - the analysis of protein concentrations and modifications, especially in response to various stresssors, at various developmental stages, or in various parts of the body.
*Metabolomics - similar to proteomics, but dealing with metabolites.
*Metalomics - similar to proteomics and metabolomics, but dealing with metal concentrations and especially with their binding to proteins and other molecules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the contemporary Christian singing group named Acappella, see [[Acappella (group)]].''
'''A cappella''' [[music]] is [[vocal music]] or [[singing]] without [[musical instrument|instrumental]] [[accompaniment]], or a piece intended to be performed in this way. ''A cappella'' is [[Italian language|Italian]] for ''like in the chapel (music)''; the term is due to restrictions on the use of instruments in medieval churches. It is often misspelled as ''a capella'', which is derived from the [[Latin]] spelling, or even ''acappella''.

== The roots of a cappella music ==

A cappella music was and is often used in [[church music]]. [[Gregorian chant]] is an example of a cappella singing, as is the majority of sacred vocal music from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]].  The [[madrigal (music)|Madrigal]], up until its development in the early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] into an instrumentally-accompanied form, is also usually an a cappella form.  The [[Amish]], [[Old Regular Baptist]]s, [[Primitive Baptist]]s, most congregations of the [[Church of Christ]], and the [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], as well as some [[Presbyterian]] churches devoted to exclusive [[Psalmody]], are religious bodies known for conducting their worship services without musical accompaniment. [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians (especially Russian and other Slavic groups) insist on singing unaccompanied by instruments. Similarly, many [[Muslim]]s have adopted the idiom of a cappella music since mainstream traditional Islam prohibits the use of instruments except for some basic percussion.  Muslim a cappella songs are known as [[nasheed]]s. [[Sacred Harp]], a type of religious &quot;folk&quot; music, is an a cappella style of religious singing. It is more often sung at singing conventions than at church services.

== Modern a cappella ==

Many standard choral works are a cappella in that no accompaniment is written in except perhaps for rehearsal purposes. But in the modern parlance, it applies to vocal performers who disdain instrumental accompaniment in all cases.

A cappella music attained renewed prominence from the late [[1970s]] onward, spurred by the success of songs by popular recording artists such as [[The Manhattan Transfer]], [[The Bobs]], [[Bobby McFerrin]], [[The Nylons]], [[Flying Pickets]], [[Die Prinzen]], [[Rockapella]], [[Take Six]], [[Wise Guys]] and [[Boyz II Men]]. This prominence in turn led to a resurgence in [[collegiate a cappella]] -- some larger universities now have a dozen groups or more.

Some of the major movements within modern a cappella are [[Barbershop music|Barbershop]], [[doo wop]], and [[contemporary a cappella]]. Contemporary a cappella includes many '''vocal bands''' who add [[vocal percussion]] or [[beatboxing]] to create a pop/rock sound. 

Arrangements of popular music for small a cappella ensembles usually include one voice singing the lead melody, one singing a rhythmic bass line, and the remaining voices contributing chordal or [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] accompaniment . (In Japan, these parts are known as '''vocal''', '''bass''', and '''chorus''', respectively.) 

A cappella can also describe the practice of using just the vocal track(s) from a [[multitrack]] recording to either [[remix]] or put onto vinyl records for DJ's. Artists will sometimes release the vocal tracks of their popular songs so fans can remix them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[music]], an '''arrangement''' loosely describes rewriting a piece of pre-existing [[music]] for a specific set of instruments or voices, often in harmony or with additional original material.  In [[jazz]] or [[Recording studio|studio]] settings, &quot;arranging&quot; is most commonly used to describe the process that is also called [[orchestration]], adaptation, setting, [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], or a variety of other terms. Orchestration differs in that it is only adapting music for an [[orchestra]] or [[musical ensemble]] while arranging &quot;involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings...Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety&quot; (Corozine 2002, p.3).

The [[American Federation of Musicians]] defines '''arranging''' as &quot;the art of preparing and adapting an already written composition for presentation in other than its original form. An arrangement may include reharmonization, paraphrasing, and/or development of a composition, so that it fully represents the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic structure&quot; (ibid).

A satisfactory musical arrangement will most likely (ibid, p.4):
*Provide &quot;contrast between high and low sounds&quot;
*Avoid heavily doubled parts with an emphasis on solo sections
*Be &quot;sufficiently transparent to allow the musical lines to be clearly heard&quot; and
*Not have all the instruments playing throughout.

An arrangement is often an adaptation of a previously arranged piece of music for a musical application other than that for which it was originally intended. This includes arrangements for different [[musical instrument|instruments]], for example an arrangement for piano or [[flute]], or a [[duet]], based on a [[symphony|symphonic]] piece, or an arrangement of instrumental [[accompaniment]] for [[vocal music]]). Or, it may be an adaptation for another musical style, for example adaptation of a classical piece for a jazz or [[Rock (music)|rock]] [[ensemble]], orchestration of a song written by a popular band, or an [[a capella]] setting of a [[song]] from a [[Musical theater|stage musical]] or an [[opera]].

An arrangement may specify or vary some or all of:

* [[Harmony|Harmonies]], including [[musical parts|parts]].
* Instrumentation.
* [[Musical style|Style]], dynamics and other instructions to the players.
* Sequence, including the order and number of repeats of sections such as [[verse]]s and [[refrain|chorus]]es, and provision of sections to be [[improvisation|improvised]] by instrumentalists.
* [[Introduction (music)|Introduction]], [[coda (music)|coda]], [[modulation]]s and other [[variation (music)|variations]].

As with composition, the ready availability of [[sound recording]] equipment has changed the understanding of what &quot;arrangement&quot; means. At one stage, credit for an arrangement would only be given to a person who had produced a written musical score of some sort. More recently, any original treatment of an existing work that is available for repeated performance by other players may qualify to be loosely called an arrangement. In jazz an unscored collaborative arrangement is called a &quot;'''head arrangement'''&quot; (Randel 2002, p.294; it is in the head of the musician(s)). Every time a piece of music is performed it has an arrangement, which may or may not have been done by a professional arranger. 

==Popular music==
In [[popular music]] an '''arrangement''' is a setting of a piece of music, which may have been [[musical composition|composed]] by the '''arranger''' or by someone else. Most commonly, this is a matter of providing [[instrumentation]] for the [[songwriter]] or [[composer]]'s basic [[melody]] and [[harmony]].  It may add details omitted by the [[composer]], or it may replace those originally given and be merely based on the original work.

==Classical music==
In [[European classical music]] an '''arrangement''' is a setting of any composition for a medium other than the one in which it was created: for example, a [[piano]] piece may be arranged for full [[orchestra]], or an orchestral composition may be arranged for solo piano.  Often arrangement involves considerable reworking of the original material, in conformance with the resources of the final medium.

==Jazz music==
In jazz music, an '''arrangement''' is a specific setting of a pre-existing composition, although in jazz, the arranger has a larger role: it is common for jazz arrangers to contribute additional original material of their own, to significantly alter the forms and structures of the pre-existing material, or to combine the pre-existing material with snippets or quotes from other pre-existing material.

Big bands such as those of Duke Ellington, Bennie Moten, and Count Basie performed head arrangements (ibid).

==Arrangers==
Commerical and jazz arrangers include:
*Gil Evans
*Robert Farnon
*Nelson Riddle
*Henry Mancini
*Gordon Jenkins
*John Williams
*Don Costa
*Eddie Sauter
*Quincy Jones
*Claude Thornhill
*Duke Ellington
*Bob Florence
*Fletcher Henderson
*Peter Matz
*Don Sebesky
*Thad Jones
*Gerry Mulligan
*Jimmy Giuffre
*Billy May
*Neil Hefti
*Billy Byers
*Bill Holman

'''Ascension Island''' is an [[island]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], around 1,000 [[mile]]s (1,600&amp;nbsp;[[kilometer|km]]) from the coast of [[Africa]]. It is a dependency of the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Saint Helena]], which is 750 miles (1,200&amp;nbsp;km) to the south. The Island is named after the day of its recorded discovery, [[Ascension Day]].

The Island is most known as the location of Wideawake Airfield, which is a joint facility of the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[United States Air Force]]. The Island was used extensively by the British military during the [[Falklands War]].

==History==

The Portuguese explorer [[Juan da Nova Castella]] is believed to be the first  person to discover the island (in [[1501]]), but did not report it. When in [[1503]] [[Alphonse d'Albuquerque]] (Afonso de Albuquerque, a [[portugal|portuguese]] navigator) saw the island on [[Ascension Day]] as listed on the Roman Catholic Church calendar, he named it for that day of its sighting. Dry and barren, it had little appeal for passing ships except as a provisioning station (local birds provided ample fresh meat), and remained uninhabited until [[1815]], when the British garrisoned it as a precaution after imprisoning [[Napoleon I of France]] on [[St Helena]] to the southeast. The [[Royal Navy]] officially designated the island as &quot;HMS Ascension&quot; with the classification of &quot;Sloop of War of the smaller class&quot;. A [[Stone frigate|Stone ship]] was a naval nickname for such land based establishments.

The location of the Island made it a useful stopping point for ships and communications. The [[Royal Navy]] used the Island as a victualling station for ships, particularly those of the [[West Africa Squadron]] working against the slave trade. A garrison of [[Royal Marines]] were based at Ascension from [[1923]]. [[1898]], the Eastern Telegraph Company (now part of [[Cable and Wireless]]), installed the first underwater cable from the Island, connecting the UK with its colonies in [[South Africa]]. In [[1922]], [[Letters Patent]] made Ascension a dependency of [[Saint Helena]], with the island being managed by the head of the Eastern Telegraph Company on the Island until [[1964]] when the British Government appointed an Administrator to represent the Governor of Saint Helena on Ascension. 
[[Image:View of Wideawake Airfield.jpg|thumb|300px|left|View of Ascension Island showing Wideawake Airfield]]
During [[World War II]], the [[United States]] built an airbase on Ascension, known as Wideawake after a neaby colony of sooty turns (locally called 'Wideawake' birds beacause of their distictive call, which sounds like they are saying &quot;wideawake! wideawake!&quot;). The airbase was used by the US military as a stopping point for American aircraft crossing the Atlantic on the way to theatres of operation in Europe and Africa. After the end of WW-2, and American departure, the airbase fell into disuse. 

With the &quot;space race&quot; and the &quot;cold war&quot; Americans began a return in [[1956]]. Wideawake airfield was expanded in the mid 1960's. The runway, with its strange hump, was extended, widened, and improved to allow its use by large aircraft, and acts as an emergency runway for the [[Space Shuttle]].  Ascension Island continues to serve as an important link in the American space projects. The [[NASA]] established a tracking station on Ascension Island in [[1967]], but has since abandonded it. The [[BBC]] installed a relay station for broadcasts to South America and Africa. 

In [[1982]], Ascension was used as a staging post for the British Task Force during the [[Falklands War]]. The [[Royal Air Force]] deployed a fleet of [[Avro_Vulcan|Vulcan]] bombers at the airfield. The opening shots of the British offensive were launched from Ascension by Vulcans in [[Operation Black Buck]]. The RAF also used the base to supply the Task Force. The increase in air traffic during the war saw Wideawake being classed as the busiest airfield in the world for a short period. The Royal Navy's fleet stopped at Ascension for refuelling on the way. Following the war, the British retained an increased presence on the island, establishing [[RAF Ascension Island]], and providing a refuelling stop for the regular airlink between [[RAF Brize Norton]] in Oxfordshire, and [[RAF Mount Pleasant]] in the [[Falkland Islands]].

==Politics==

Ascension is a dependency of Saint Helena, an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. Executive authority is vested in [[Queen Elizabeth II|The Queen]], who is represented by the [[Governor of Saint Helena]]. As the Governor resides in [[Jamestown]], Saint Helena, an [[Administrator of Ascension Island|Administrator]] is appointed to represent the Governor on Ascension Island.

In [[2002]], changes in the constitutional arrangements for Ascension Island, saw the first Island Council being elected. 

Ascension also has its own suite of local laws, based on the law of Saint Helena, and the UK.

==Geography==
[[Image:Ascension Island Map.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of Ascension Island]]
The main island has an area of approximately 35 [[square mile]]s (91&amp;nbsp;km²)&lt;!-- From http://www.ascension-island.gov.ac/ascension.htm --&gt;. A volcanic peak rising from just west of the [[mid-Atlantic Ridge]], much of the island is a wasteland of lava flows and cinder cones; no less than 44 distinct craters have been identified. While it was barren with very few plants as recently as [[1843]], Ascension Island's [[Green Mountain]] is now one of the few large-scale [[artificial forest]]s, and is gradually growing with each year. Its highest point is at 2,817&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (859&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]]).

Ascension's climate is subtropical, with temperatures at the coast ranging from about 68 to 88 [[Fahrenheit]] (20&amp;ndash;31&amp;nbsp;°C), and about 10 degrees cooler at the highest point. Rain showers may occur at any time during the year, but tend to be heavier between January and April.

==Demographics==

There is no indigenous population on the Island, although around 1,100 people live there as of 2005. The military and civilian contractors of the United States and the United Kingdom, along with citizen workers imported from Saint Helena, make up the bulk of the population. The United States of America has around 150 people who service the US Air Force facilities on the island and at Wideawake airfield. [[RAF Ascension Island]] is made up of 200 staff. Other residents include some British government employees including the island's British Administrator.

There are five settlements, the capital being '''[[Georgetown]]''':

#Georgetown (pop. 560)
#Cat Hill (Main Base, the U.S. base, pop. 150)
#The Residency
#Traveller's Hill (Wideawake, the Royal Air Force base, pop. 200)
#Two Boats Village

Additionally, there are some cottages on Green Mountain.

It is difficult to gain an entry to Ascension Island as one needs the written permission of the Administrator. Additionally, it is a near-impossibility to take up permanent residence. Employment is a requirement to stay on the island.  The UK government has asserted that no inhabitant of Ascension Island has a &quot;right to abode.&quot; It is a point now in dispute by Council members, long time employees, and their family members, as noted in the local newspaper &quot;The Islander.&quot;

==Economy==
[[Image:Stamp_Ascension_1937_1.5p.jpg|200px|thumb|View of &quot;The Pier&quot;, 1938]]

The main economic activity on the island is centered around the military bases at Wideawake Airfield. SERCO Ltd manages the airport with ESS Ltd providing catering and domestic facilities. A former feature of Ascension was the permanently moored 70,000 tonne tanker offshore run by the Maersk which served as a bulk fuel facility but in December 2002 this was replaced by an on-shore Petroleum Supply Depot under military management

The Island also hosts many communications and relay stations, exploiting the Island's strategic position in the middle of Atlantic Ocean. Both the [[BBC]] and [[Cable and Wireless]] have communications posts there. 

The main export item is [[Postage stamps of Ascension Island|Ascension Island postage stamps]], first issued in [[1922]]. Typically 5 to 6 sets of stamps are issued each year.

Very limited tourism exists, mostly for sportfishing. Further restricting access is the inaccessability of the island to transport, and restrictive permissions required for entry.

==Transport==
[[Image:Ascension_Island_Location.jpg|200px|thumb|Ascension Island Location]]

The Island has a regular airlink with the United Kingdom and the Falkland Islands, with weekly flights to [[RAF Brize Norton]], west of [[London]] and to [[RAF Mount Pleasant]] in the [[Falkland Islands]]. Although these are operated by the Royal Air Force, civilians are permitted to fly at their own expense. The United States maintains a weekly flight between the Island and [[Patrick Air Force Base]] in [[Florida]]. Past UK and US governments have reached an agreement to allow civilan aircraft to land on Ascension Island. It was a move designed to improve tourist links-- and islanders economy--although no services have yet taken place, and the possibility of this is being reconsidered. 

The [[RMS Saint Helena|RMS ''Saint Helena'']] operates between Ascension Island and Saint Helena on a scheduled basis, and provides a connection to [[Cape Town]] and [[Cardiff]]. The US military service their base and facilities with a regular supply ship and air transport.

Within Ascension, there is no public transport and no taxis, any visitors requiring transport are required to hire a car.  There are about 25 miles (40 km) of roads on the island. &lt;!-- cia.gov --&gt;

== Flora and Fauna==

The protected [[Green turtle]] is perhaps the most notable of the wildlife, coming ashore to lay their eggs on the beaches from January to May. [[Sooty tern]] or &quot;Wideawake Bird&quot; nests in great seashore lava &quot;fairs,&quot; along with [[booby|boobies]], [[petrel]]s, [[noddie]]s, [[Ascension frigate bird]]s, and [[boatswain bird]]s. On land are found [[canary|canaries]], [[francolin]]s, [[mynah]]s, [[sparrow]]s, and [[waxbill]]s. A variety of mammals have been introduced: donkey, sheep, cats and rats among others. Reptiles consist of two species of lizards.  In summer flies are problematic.  Crowning Green Mountain is a lush halo of bamboo, while on one flank is a large stand of tall pine trees.  A few wild flowers narrowly abound [[periwinkle]], cactus is present with land crabs in several large colonies near the sea and mountains.  

Offshore, there is a variety of open-ocean fish, including [[shark]]s, [[wahoo]], [[tuna]], [[bonita]], [[barracuda]], [[marlin]], [[blackfish]] and [[sailfish]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Athanasian Creed''' (''Quicunque vult'') is a statement of [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine traditionally ascribed to [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius]], Archbishop of [[Alexandria]], who lived in the [[4th century]]. However most of today's historians agree that in all probability it was originally written in [[Latin]], not in [[Greek language|Greek]], and probably originated in Gaul around 500; if so, then Athanasius cannot have been the original author. Its [[theology]] is closely akin to that found in the writing of Western theologians, especially [[Ambrose of Milan]].

It was designed to overcome [[Arianism]]. Liturgically, this Creed was recited at the Sunday Office of [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]] in the Western Church; it is not used in the Eastern Church. 

Today the Athanasian Creed is rarely used even in the Western Church.  When used, one common practice is to use it once a year on [[Trinity Sunday]].

==English-Language Translations==

===The ICET English Language Translation===

The following translation was prepared by
the [[Consultation on Common Texts|International Consultation on English Texts]]:

:Whoever wants to be saved should above all cling to the catholic faith.

:Whoever does not guard it whole and inviolable will doubtless perish eternally.

:Now this is the catholic faith: We worship one God in trinity and the Trinity in unity, neither confusing the persons nor dividing the divine being.

:For the Father is one person, the Son is another, and the Spirit is still another.

:But the deity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is one, equal in glory, coeternal in majesty.

:What the Father is, the Son is, and so is the Holy Spirit.

:Uncreated is the Father; uncreated is the Son; uncreated is the Spirit.

:The Father is infinite; the Son is infinite; the Holy Spirit is infinite.

:Eternal is the Father; eternal is the Son; eternal is the Spirit:

:And yet there are not three eternal beings, but one who is eternal;

:as there are not three uncreated and unlimited beings, but one who is uncreated and unlimited.

:Almighty is the Father; almighty is the Son; almighty is the Spirit:

:And yet there are not three almighty beings, but one who is almighty.

:Thus the Father is God; the Son is God; the Holy Spirit is God:

:And yet there are not three gods, but one God.

:Thus the Father is Lord; the Son is Lord; the Holy Spirit is Lord:

:And yet there are not three lords, but one Lord.

:As Christian truth compels us to acknowledge each distinct person as God and Lord, so catholic religion forbids us to say that there are three gods or lords.

:The Father was neither made nor created nor begotten;

:the Son was neither made nor created, but was alone begotten of the Father;

:the Spirit was neither made nor created, but is proceeding from the Father and the Son.

:Thus there is one Father, not three fathers; one Son, not three sons; one Holy Spirit, not three spirits.

:And in this Trinity, no one is before or after, greater or less than the other;

:but all three persons are in themselves, coeternal and coequal; and so we must worship the Trinity in unity and the one God in three persons.

:Whoever wants to be saved should think thus about the Trinity.

:It is necessary for eternal salvation that one also faithfully believe that our Lord Jesus Christ became flesh.

:For this is the true faith that we believe and confess: That our Lord Jesus Christ, God's Son, is both God and man.

:He is God, begotten before all worlds from the being of the Father, and he is man, born in the world from the being of his mother --

:existing fully as God, and fully as man with a rational soul and a human body;

:equal to the Father in divinity, subordinate to the Father in humanity.

:Although he is God and man, he is not divided, but is one Christ.

:He is united because God has taken humanity into himself; he does not transform deity into humanity.

:He is completely one in the unity of his person, without confusing his natures.

:For as the rational soul and body are one person, so the one Christ is God and man.

:He suffered death for our salvation.

:He descended into hell and rose again from the dead.

:He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.

:He will come again to judge the living and the dead.

:At his coming all people shall rise bodily to give an account of their own deeds.

:Those who have done good will enter eternal life,

:those who have done evil will enter eternal fire.

:This is the catholic faith.

:One cannot be saved without believing this firmly and faithfully.

===Book of Common Prayer 1662 Church of England===

''(Note that this version contains an arguable borderline mistranslation when the Latin word &quot;immensus&quot;, meaning immeasurable or infinite, is rendered into English as &quot;incomprehensible&quot;, and uses some terms which probably convey very little specific meaning to the mind of the typical 21st-century English-speaker, such as when the Latin word &quot;divinitas&quot;, meaning divine nature or quality of divinity, is translated into English as &quot;godhead&quot;.)''

:At Morning Prayer

:Upon these Feasts; Christmas Day, the Epiphany, Saint Matthias, Easter Day, Ascension Day, Whitsunday, Saint John Baptist, Saint James, Saint Bartholomew, Saint Matthew, Saint Simon and Saint Jude, Saint Andrew, and upon Trinity Sunday, shall be sung or said, this Confession of our Christian Faith, commonly called the Creed of Saint Athanasius, by the Minister and people standing.

:QUICUNQUE VULT

:Whosoever will be saved : before all things it is necessary that he hold the Catholick Faith.

:Which Faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled : without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.

:And the Catholick Faith is this : That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;

:Neither confounding the Persons : not dividing the Substance.

:For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son : and another of the Holy Ghost.

:But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is all one : the Glory equal, the Majesty co-eternal.

:Such as the Father is, such is the Son : and such is the Holy Ghost.

:The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate : and the Holy Ghost uncreate.

:The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible : and the Holy Ghost incomprehensible.

:The Father eternal, the Son eternal : and the Holy Ghost eternal.

:And yet they are not three eternals : but one eternal.

:As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated : but one uncreated, and one incomprehensible.

:So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty : and the Holy Ghost Almighty.

:And yet they are not three Almighties : but one Almighty.

:So the Father is God, the Son is God : and the Holy Ghost is God.

:And yet they are not three Gods : but one God.

:So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord : and the Holy Ghost Lord.

:And yet not three Lords : but one Lord.

:For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity : to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord;

:So are we forbidden by the Catholick Religion : to say there be three Gods, or three Lords.

:The Father is made of none : neither created, nor begotten.

:The Son is of the Father alone : not made, nor created, but begotten.

:The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son : neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.

:So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons : one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.

:And in this Trinity none is afore, or after other : none is greater, or less than another;

:But the whole three Persons are co-eternal together : and co-equal.

:So that in all things, as is aforesaid : the Unity in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.

:He therefore that will be saved : must thus think of the Trinity.

:Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation : that he also believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.

:For the right Faith is that we believe and confess : that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man;

:God, of the Substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds : and Man, of the Substance of his Mother, born in the world;

:Perfect God, and Perfect Man : of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting;

:Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead : and inferior to the Father, as touching his Manhood.

:Who although he be God and Man : yet he is not two, but one Christ;

:One, not by the conversion of the Godhead into flesh : but by taking of the Manhood into God;

:One altogether, not by confusion of Substance : but by unity of Person.

:For as reasonable soul and flesh is one man : so God and Man is one Christ.

:Who suffered for our salvation : descended into hell, rose again the third day from the dead.

:He ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty : from whence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

:At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies : and shall give account for their own works.

:And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting : and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.

:This is the Catholick Faith : which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be saved.

:Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the Holy Ghost;

:As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be : world without end.  Amen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Alicante, Spain location.png|frame]]
'''Alicante''' ([[Spanish language|Castillian Spanish]]) or '''Alacant''' ([[Catalan language|Valencian Catalan]]) is the capital of the province of [[Alicante (province)|Alicante]] and of the [[comarca]] of the [[Alacantí]], in the southern part of the [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian community]], [[Spain]], a historic [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] port.  The population of the city of Alicante proper was 319,380, estimated [[as of 2005]], of the entire urban area, 427,217. Population of the [[metropolitan area]] (including satellite towns) was 711,215 as of 2005 estimates, ranking as the eighth-largest metropolitan area of Spain.

[[Image:Alicante_Spain_townhall.jpg|thumb|left|200px|City Hall.]]
Alicante is one of the fastest-growing cities in Spain. Its economy is based upon tourism in the beaches from [[Costa Blanca]] coast, [[wine]] production, services and administration. It exports wine, olive oil, and fruit, and has light industries, including food-processing, leather, textiles, and pottery. ''[[turrón|turrones]]'' (''torrons'' in Catalan) &amp;mdash;a honey and almond [[nougat]]&amp;mdash;is a food specialty of Alicante.

[[Image:Alicante_Spain_marina.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marine of Alicante.]]
The city has regular [[ferry]] services to the [[Balearic Islands]], and an international airport is nearby. It is strongly fortified, with a spacious harbor.  Amongst the most notable features of the city is its [[castle]], the &quot;Castillo de Santa Barbara&quot;, which sits high above the city upon a cliff.  The most important festival,  the ''[[Bonfires of Saint John]]'', takes place at the time of the [[summer solstice]], and they are declared of international touristic interest. Another well-known festival is ''[[Moros y Cristianos]]'' in any quarter of the city, such as Altozano or Saint Blase.

The city is the headquarters of the [[Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market]].
[[Image:Alicante_Spain_-_the_city_and_the_sea.jpg|thumb|right|400px|View over Alicante and the [[Mediterranean]].]]

==Population==
The population of *[http://www.alicante-spain.com Alicante] in 2005 was 325,797 inhabitants, 711,215 in the metropolitan area &quot;Alicante-[[Elx]]&quot;. About 15% of the population is foreign, mostly those from [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Colombia]].

==History==
[[Image:Skyline de Alicante.JPG|thumb|right|400px|The Mediterranean]]
Alicante was founded in [[324 BC]] by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], who named it ''Akra Leuke'' (White Peak). In [[201 BC]] it was captured by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] who called it ''Lucentum'', and [[Hannibal]] is said to have unloaded his famous [[war elephant]]s here. Between [[718]] and [[1249]], the city was ruled by the [[Moors]]. In [[1265]] it was retaken by [[Alfonso X of Castile]] and incorporated into the kingdom of [[Castile]]. In [[1304]] it was incorporated into the kingdom of Valencia, in the [[Aragon]] Crown.

The city was besieged by the [[France|French]] in [[1709]] and [[1812]], and later by the Federalists of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] in [[1873]].  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], Alicante was bombed by Italian aircraft, and was one of the last cities to fall to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. In Alicante, the Falangist [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]] was executed in November 1936. 

In 1982 and 1997 heavy rain caused severe flooding and some loss of life.

{{portal}}
The '''Macintosh''', or '''Mac''', line of [[personal computer]]s is designed, developed, manufactured, and marketed by [[Apple Computer]]. Named after the [[McIntosh|McIntosh apple]], the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] was released on [[January 24]], [[1984]]. It was the first commercially successful personal computer to use a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] instead of the then-standard [[command line interface]]. 

The current range of Macintoshes varies from Apple's &quot;budget&quot; [[Mac mini]] desktop, to its mid-range server, the [[Xserve]]. Macintosh systems are mainly targeted towards the home, education, and creative professional markets; more recently, the Xserve G5 server has enabled Apple to gain entry to the corporate market. Production of the Macintosh is based upon a [[vertical integration]] model, in that Apple facilitates all aspects of its hardware, and creates its own operating system, the same method used in [[video game console|gaming consoles]] (the original IBM PC was conceived as a vertically integrated platform but in a key decision, Microsoft was able to retain the rights to its software).

The [[Mac OS history|original Macintosh operating system]] underwent many major revisions. However, the final version, [[Mac OS 9|Mac OS 9.2.2]], still lacked many modern operating system features. In 2001, Apple introduced the new [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] [[Unix-like|Unix]]-based [[Mac OS X]], featuring improved stability, multitasking and multi-user capability, while supporting older &quot;Classic&quot; applications by providing a [[Classic (Mac OS X)|&quot;Classic&quot; compatibility layer]]. The current version of Mac OS X is [[Mac OS X v10.4|Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger]], which is sold preinstalled in all Macs. (The Xserve comes with [[Mac OS X Server]].) To complement the Macintosh, Apple has developed a series of digital media applications (collectively the [[iLife]] suite), two applications that are geared towards productivity (the [[iWork]] suite), and software aimed at the creative professional market, including [[Final Cut Pro]], [[Shake (software)|Shake]], and [[Aperture (photography software)|Aperture]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Apple Computer}}

=== 1979–84: Development and introduction ===
[[Image:Mac Design Team.jpg|thumb|250px|A part of the original Macintosh design team, as seen on the cover of Revolution in the Valley. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;Left to right: [[George Crow]], [[Joanna Hoffman]], [[Burrell Smith]], [[Andy Hertzfeld]], [[Bill Atkinson]], [[Jerry Mannock]].&lt;/small&gt;]]
The Macintosh project started in early 1979 with [[Jef Raskin]], an Apple employee, who envisioned an easy-to-use, low-cost computer for the average consumer. In September 1979, Raskin was given permission to start hiring for the project, and he began to look for an engineer who could put together a prototype. [[Bill Atkinson]], a member of the Lisa team (which was developing a similar but higher-end computer), introduced him to [[Burrell Smith]], a service technician who had been hired earlier that year as Apple employee #282. Over the years, Raskin hired a large development team that designed and built the original Macintosh [[hardware]] and [[Computer software|software]]; besides Raskin, Atkinson and Smith, the team included [[Chris Espinosa]], [[Joanna Hoffman]], [[George Crow]], [[Jerry Manock]], [[Susan Kare]] and [[Andy Hertzfeld]].

Smith's first Macintosh board design was built to Raskin's specifications: it had 64 [[kilobytes]] of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], used the Motorola 6809E [[microprocessor]], and was capable of supporting a 256 × 256 [[pixel]] [[black-and-white]] [[bitmap]] display. (The final product used a 9&quot;, 512x342 [[monochrome]] display.) [[Bud Tribble]], a Macintosh programmer, was interested in running the Lisa's graphical programs on the Macintosh, and asked Smith whether he could incorporate the Lisa’s [[Motorola 68000]] microprocessor into the Mac while still keeping the production cost down. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000, but made it faster, bumping it from 5 to 8 [[Megahertz]], a 60% clock speed increase; this board also had the capacity to support a 384 × 256 bitmap display. Smith’s design used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, and because of this, production of the board was significantly more cost-efficient&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Five_Different_Macs.txt Andy Hertzfeld: Five different Macintoshes], retrieved [[November 9]], [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;. At this time in December 1980, Smith's Macintosh (personally [[Wire wrap|wire-wrap]]ped by hand by Smith himself) was the only one in existence, though Brian Howard and Dan Kottke had already begun wire-wrapping their own. By this time Tribble had already written a boot ROM which filled the screen with the proverbial &quot;hello&quot;, a 32 pixel-wide bitmap which demonstrated the Macintosh's sharp video. The final Mac design was self-contained and had far more programming code in [[read-only memory|ROM]] than most other computers; it had 128KB of RAM, in the form of sixteen, 64-[[Kilobit|Kbit]] RAM chips soldered to the [[motherboard|logicboard]]. Though there were no memory slots, it was expandable to 512KB of RAM by means of soldering sixteen 256-Kbit RAM chips in place of the factory-installed chips. This was thanks to Burrell Smith's clever work: he routed a few extra lines on the PC board, making the 256-Kbit chips on the horizon useable in the Mac. This meant adventurous Mac users could upgrade their &quot;Mac 128K&quot; to 512KB of RAM without buying a whole new machine. [[Steve Jobs]] was utterly against this at the time (because he didn't want people &quot;mucking around inside the Mac&quot; and because he wanted them to buy the 512K Mac after it came out), but Burrell slipped it in quickly and no one told Jobs, to the benefit of Macintosh owners.

[[Image:Ad apple 1984 4.png|200px|left|thumb|The announcer's dialogue in Apple’s [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 ad]] scrolls across the screen as he says it. The text advertises that the Macintosh would defeat the &quot;[[Orwellian]]&quot; dominance of PCs.]]

The innovative design caught the attention of Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, he began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin finally left the Macintosh project in 1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs, and the final Macintosh design is said to be closer to Jobs’ ideas than Raskin’s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=The_Father_of_The_Macintosh.txt Andy Hertzfeld: The father of the Macintosh], retrieved [[November 19]], [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;. After hearing about the pioneering graphical user interface (GUI) technology being developed at Xerox PARC, Steve Jobs negotiated a visit to see the [[Xerox Alto]] computer and [[Smalltalk]] development tools in exchange for Apple stock options. The Lisa and Macintosh user interfaces were clearly influenced by the one designed at Xerox. Jobs also commissioned industrial designer [[Hartmut Esslinger]] to work on the Macintosh line, resulting in the [[Snow White design language|&quot;Snow White&quot; design language]]; although it came too late for the earliest Macs, it was implemented in most other mid- to late-1980s Apple computers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsnail.com/apple/local/design/design2.html History of computer design: Snow White], retrieved [[November 9]], [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, Jobs’ leadership at the Macintosh project was short lived; after an internal power struggle with Apple’s new CEO [[John Sculley]], Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985, went on to found [[NeXT]], another computer company, and did not return until 1997. Sculley completely undermined what the Mac team had been trying to do with the price of the Macintosh, when he artificially inflated the Mac's price from $1,995 to $2,495. The Mac team had been working incredibly hard to keep down the price in every aspect of its design, but neither Jobs nor anyone else was able to convince him otherwise, and the Mac launched at $2,495- twenty-five percent higher than intended. 

The Macintosh was officially announced on [[January 22]], [[1984]], with the now-famous [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 Super Bowl commercial]] directed by Ridley Scott. The Mac itself was officially introduced and went on sale on [[January 24]], [[1984]] for a retail price of $2,495, bundled with two useful programs designed to show off its interface: [[MacWrite]] and [[MacPaint]]. Although the Mac garnered an immediate, enthusiastic following, it was too radical for some. Because the machine was entirely designed around the GUI, existing text-mode and [[command line interface|command-driven program]]s had to be redesigned and rewritten; this was a challenging undertaking that many [[software developer]]s shied away from, and resulted in an initial lack of software for the new system. Many users, accustomed to the arcane world of command lines, labeled the Mac a mere &quot;toy.&quot; In 2004, twenty years later, Apple irked some long-time Mac users by rerunning the 1984 commercial on its website, with an Apple iPod digitally inserted, worn by the woman, played by [[Anya Major]].

=== 1985–89: The desktop publishing era ===
In 1985, the combination of the Mac, Apple’s [[LaserWriter]] printer, and Mac-specific software like Boston Software's MacPublisher and [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus PageMaker]] (now Adobe PageMaker) enabled users to design, preview, and print page layouts complete with text and graphics, an activity known as [[desktop publishing]]. Desktop publishing was unique to the Macintosh, but eventually became available for PC users as well. Later, programs such as  [[Macromedia FreeHand]], [[QuarkXPress]] and [[Adobe Illustrator]] strengthened the Mac's position as a graphics computer and helped to expand the emerging desktop publishing market.

The limitations of the first Mac soon became clear: it had very little memory, even compared with other personal computers in 1984, and could not be expanded easily; and it lacked a [[Hard disk|hard drive]] and the means to attach one easily. Although by 1985 the Mac’s base memory had increased to 512KB, and it was possible, although inconvenient and difficult, to expand the memory of a 128KB Mac, Apple realized that the Mac needed improvement in these areas. The result was the [[Macintosh Plus]], released in 1986. It offered one megabyte of RAM, expandable to four, and a then-revolutionary [[SCSI]] parallel interface, allowing up to seven peripherals&amp;mdash;such as hard drives and scanners&amp;mdash;to be attached to the machine. Its [[floppy drive]] was increased to 800-kilobyte capacity. The Plus was an immediate success and remained in production for four years.

[[Image:Macintosh II.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Macintosh II]], the first expandable Macintosh.]]

Other issues remained, particularly the low processor speed and limited graphics ability, which had hobbled the Mac’s ability to make inroads into the business computing market. Updated [[Motorola]] [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] made a faster machine possible, and in 1987 Apple took advantage of the new Motorola technology and introduced the [[Macintosh II]], which used a 16MHz [[Motorola 68020]] processor. This marked the start of a new direction for the Macintosh, as now, for the first time, it had open architecture with several expansion slots, support for color graphics and a modular break out design similar to that of the IBM PC and inspired by Apple's other line, the expandable Apple II series. Alongside the Macintosh II, the [[Macintosh SE]] was released, the first compact Mac with an internal expansion slot. (SE aptly stood for System Expansion.) The SE shared the Macintosh II’s &quot;Snow White&quot; design language, as well as the new [[Apple Desktop Bus]] mouse and keyboard that had first appeared on the [[Apple IIGS|Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;]] some months earlier.

With the new [[Motorola 68030]] processor came the [[Macintosh IIx]] in 1988, which had benefited from internal improvements, including an on-board [[memory management unit|MMU]]. It was followed in 1989 by a more compact version with fewer slots (the [[Macintosh IIcx]]) and a version of the Mac SE powered by the 16MHz 68030 (the [[Macintosh SE/30]]). Later that year, the [[Macintosh IIci]], running at 25MHz, was the first Mac to be &quot;[[Mac OS memory management#32-bit clean|32-bit clean]]&quot;, allowing it to natively support more than 8MB of RAM, unlike its predecessors, which had &quot;32-bit dirty&quot; ROMs. [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7]] was the first Macintosh operating system to support 32-bit addressing. Apple also introduced the [[Macintosh Portable]], a 16MHz 68000 machine with an active matrix [[Active-matrix liquid crystal display|flat panel display]]. The following year the 40MHz [[Macintosh IIfx]], costing $13,000, was unveiled. Apart from its fast processor, it had significant internal architectural improvements, including faster memory and a pair of dedicated [[Input/output|I/O]] (input/output) coprocessors.

=== 1990–98: Growth and decline ===
[[Image:Macintosh classic.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Macintosh Classic]], Apple’s early 1990s budget model.]]
[[Windows 3.0|Microsoft Windows 3.0]], widely seen as the first version of Windows to challenge the Mac in both performance and feature set, was released in May 1990 and was a usable, less expensive alternative to the Macintosh platform. Apple’s response was to introduce a range of relatively inexpensive Macs in October 1990. The [[Macintosh Classic]], essentially a less expensive version of the Macintosh SE, sold for $999, making it the least expensive Mac until the re-release (and subsequent price cut) of the 400MHz iMac in February 2001. The 68020-powered [[Macintosh LC]], in its distinctive &quot;pizza box&quot; case, was available for $1800; it offered color graphics and was accompanied by a new, low-cost 512 × 384-pixel monitor. The [[Macintosh IIsi]], essentially a 20MHz IIci with only one expansion slot, cost $2500. All three machines sold well, although Apple’s profit margin was considerably lower than on earlier machines.

1991 saw the much-anticipated release of System 7, a 32-bit rewrite of the [[Mac OS|Macintosh operating system]] that improved its handling of color graphics, memory addressing, networking, and [[computer multitasking|multitasking]], and introduced [[virtual memory]]. Later that year, Apple introduced the [[Macintosh Quadra]] 700 and 900, the first Macs to employ the faster [[Motorola 68040]] processor. They were joined by improved versions of the previous year’s hits, the [[Macintosh Classic II]] and [[Macintosh LC II]]. The latter was upgraded to use a 16MHz 68030 CPU.

[[Image:Powerbook150.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[PowerBook]] 150, the smallest of the second generation of PowerBooks.]]
At the same time, the first three models in Apple's enduring [[PowerBook]] range were introduced&amp;mdash;the PowerBook 100, a miniaturized Macintosh Portable built by [[Sony]]; the 16MHz 68030 PowerBook 140; and the 25MHz 68030 PowerBook 170. They were the first portable computers with the keyboard behind a palm rest, and with a built-in pointing device (a [[trackball]]) in front of the keyboard.

In 1992, Apple started to sell a low-end Mac, the [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]], through nontraditional dealers. At Apple dealers, a mid-range version of the Quadra series called the [[Macintosh Centris]] was offered, only to be quickly renamed Quadra when buyers became confused by the range of Classics, LCs, IIs, Quadras, Performas, and Centrises. As well as releasing several new Macintosh products, Apple unveiled the miniaturized [[PowerBook Duo]] range. This was intended to be docked to a base station for desktop-like functionality in the workplace. The PowerBook Duo was dropped from the Apple product line in early 1997.

The next evolutionary step in Macintosh CPUs was a switch to the [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[PowerPC]] architecture developed by the [[AIM alliance]] of Apple Computer, IBM, and Motorola. Since its introduction, the [[Power Macintosh]] line proved to be highly successful, with over a million units sold by late 1994, three months ahead of Apple’s one-year goal. In the same year, Apple released the second-generation PowerBook models, the [[PowerBook 500]] series, which introduced the novel [[trackpad]].

By 1995, Microsoft and Intel were rapidly eroding Apple’s market share with their respective [[Windows 95]] operating system and [[Pentium]] processors, both of which significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of the PC. In response, Apple started the [[Macintosh clone]] program to regain its foothold in the desktop computer market. This program lasted until August 1997, when Steve Jobs returned to Apple and pulled the plug on the whole operation, reasoning that Apple was in the clone market simply to make reparations, when they should instead focus on the future.

=== 1999 to the present: New beginnings ===
[[Image:Steve Jobs with iMac.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Steve Jobs introducing the original iMac computer in 1998.]]
In 1998, a year after Steve Jobs had returned to the company, Apple introduced an all-in-one Macintosh that was similar to the original Macintosh 128K: the [[iMac]], a new design that did away with most Apple standard connections, such as SCSI and ADB, in favor of two [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB) ports. It featured an innovative new design; its translucent plastic case, originally [[Bondi blue]] and [[white]], and later many other colors, is considered an industrial design hallmark of the late 1990s. The iMac proved to be phenomenally successful, with 800,000 units sold in 1998, making the company an annual profit of $309 million &amp;mdash; Apple’s first profitable year since [[Michael Spindler]] took over as CEO in 1995. At MacWorld 2000, San Francisco, Steve Jobs bragged that they had sold over 1.35 million iMacs the previous quarter; one every six seconds. The Power Macintosh was redesigned along similar lines.

In 1999, Apple introduced a new operating system, [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]] (codenamed Rhapsody), with a new GUI and powerful Unix underpinnings. Its NeXT-like GUI left many Mac users disappointed, and wondering what the next generation of the Mac OS GUI would look like. Mac OS X was based on [[OPENSTEP]], the operating system developed by Steve Jobs’ post-Apple company NeXT. Mac OS X was not released to the public until September 2000, as the [[Mac OS X Public Beta]], with an Aqua interface, much different from Mac OS Server. It cost $29.99 and allowed adventurous Mac users to sample Apple's new operating system and provide feedback to the company on what they wanted to see in the actual release.

[[Image:MacBook.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[MacBook Pro]] is the first portable Macintosh to use Intel chips intended to be marketed to consumers. Shipping is scheduled to commence in February 2006.]]

In mid-1999, Apple introduced the [[iBook]], a new consumer-level, portable Macintosh that was designed to be similar in appearance to the iMac that had been introduced a year earlier. Six weeks after the iBook’s unveiling, more than 140,000 orders had been placed, and by October the computer was as much a sales hit as the iMac. Apple continued to add new products to their lineup, such as the [[eMac]] and [[Power Mac G4]], as well make two major upgrades of the iMac. On [[January 11]], [[2005]], Apple announced the release of the Mac mini priced at $499, the least expensive Mac to date.

In recent years, Apple has seen a significant boost in sales of Macs. Many claim that this is due, in part, to the success of the iPod. The term [[halo effect]] has been coined to indicate the effect of satisfied iPod owners, who purchase more Apple merchandise, on the overall sales made by Apple. The iPod [[digital audio player]]s have recaptured a brand awareness of the Macintosh line that had not been seen since its original release in 1984. From 2001 to 2005, Macintosh sales increased continuously on an annual basis. On [[October 11]], [[2005]], Apple released its fourth quarter results, reporting shipment of 1,236,000 Macintoshes&amp;mdash; a 48% increase from the same quarter the previous year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/oct/11results.html Apple Reports Fourth Quarter Results], retrieved [[November 9]], [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Starting with the introduction of the iMac Core Duo and the [[MacBook Pro]] on [[January 10]], [[2006]], Apple will gradually [[Apple Intel transition|switch]] from PowerPC microprocessors to microprocessors manufactured by Intel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006], retrieved [[December 7]], [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;. The transition of the rest of the Macintosh line is planned to be completed by the end of the year&lt;ref&gt;[[Ars Technica]]'s [http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060110-5938.html transcript] of Steve Jobs' keynote at the [[Macworld Conference and Expo]] 2006&lt;/ref&gt;. It is possible that sales will temporarily decline as consumers wait to purchase future Macintosh products.

{{Timeline of Macintosh models}}

== Hardware ==
The current Macintosh product family uses many hardware components; among these are PowerPC processors, which were co-developed by Apple, [[IBM]], and Motorola, and are currently produced by IBM and [[Freescale Semiconductor|Freescale]], a former division of Motorola. As of January 2006, Intel [[x86]] processors are in Macs as well. All Macintosh models ship with at least 512MB RAM as standard, and as of [[October 12]], [[2005]], the [[iMac|iMac G5]] ships with the Apple Mighty Mouse, a touch-sensitive optical mouse with a miniature clickable trackball-like device that is produced by Apple. Current Macintosh computers use the [[ATI Radeon]] or [[GeForce|nVidia GeForce]] series chips for graphics and include either a [[Combo Drive]], a DVD player and CD burner all in one; or the [[SuperDrive]], a dual-function DVD and CD burner. Macintoshes include two standard data transfer ports: [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], standardized in 1998 with the iMac; and [[FireWire]], a less popular standard developed by Apple to support higher-performance devices.

=== Processor architecture ===
The original Macintosh used a [[Motorola 68000]], a 16/32-bit (32-bit internal) [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] processor that ran at 8MHz. The Macintosh Portable and PowerBook 100 both used a 16MHz version of this processor. The Macintosh II featured a full 32-bit [[Motorola 68020]] processor, but the Macs at the time supported only 24-bit memory addressing, therefore using only a fraction of the chip's memory addressing capabilities. Macs with this limitation were referred to as not being &quot;32-bit clean&quot;. The successor Macintosh IIx introduced the [[Motorola 68030]] processor, which added a [[Memory Management Unit]]. The 68030 did not have a built-in [[floating point unit]]; thus, '030-based Macintoshes incorporated a separate unit&amp;mdash;either the [[Motorola 68881|68881]] or [[Motorola 68882|68882]]. Lower-cost models did without, although they incorporated an FPU socket, should the user decide to add one as an option. The first &quot;32-bit clean&quot; Macintosh that could use 32-bit memory addressing was the IIci. Later, Apple released the Macintosh IIfx, which not only contained a 40MHz 68030, but two [[MOS Technology 6502]] processors (the primary CPU in the older Apple II line) as auxiliary controllers. In 1991 Apple released the first computers containing the [[Motorola 68040]] processor, which contained the floating point unit in the main processor. Again, lower-cost models did not have FPUs, being based on the cut-down [[Freescale 68LC040|Motorola 68LC040]] instead.

Since 1994 Apple has been using the PowerPC line of processors, starting with the [[PowerPC 601]], which were later upgraded to the [[PowerPC 603|603]] and [[PowerPC 604|604]]. In 1997, Apple introduced its first computer based on the significantly upgraded [[PowerPC G3]] processor; this was followed in 1999 with the [[PowerPC G4]]. The latest generation of processor in use is the 64-bit [[PowerPC 970|PowerPC G5]], introduced in 2003. During the transition to the PowerPC, Apple's &quot;Cognac&quot; team wrote a 68030-to-PowerPC [[Mac 68k emulator|emulator]] that booted very early in OS loading.  Initially the emulation speed wasn't stellar; emulation is hardly ever speedy. Later versions used a [[dynamic recompilation]] emulator which boosted performance by caching frequently used sections of translated code. The first version of the OS to ship with the earliest PowerPC systems was estimated to run 95% emulated. Later versions of the operating system increased the percentage of PowerPC native code until OS X brought it to 100% native.

On [[June 6]], [[2005]], Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced that the company would begin transitioning the Macintosh line from PowerPC to Intel microprocessors, expected to be completed by the end of 2006, and demonstrated a version of Mac OS X running on a computer powered by an Intel [[Pentium 4]] CPU. Intel-powered Macs will be able to run Macintosh software compiled for PowerPC processors using a [[binary translation|dynamic translation]] system known as [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]]. The reason for this switch concerns problems with the power consumption of the IBM G5 processors, coupled with IBM's inability to deliver on the promised roadmap. The first Macintoshes with Intel processors were the iMac Core Duo and the MacBook Pro, both announced at the [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|Macworld Conference and Expo]] in January 2006 and using the [[Intel Core|Core Duo]] processor.

=== Expandability and connectivity ===
[[Image:Type A USB connector.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A typical [[Universal Serial Bus]] (&quot;USB&quot;) Type A cable; the USB has become standard on modern Macintosh computers.]]

The earliest form of Macintosh expandability was the [[Processor Direct Slot]] (PDS), present from the SE onwards. It was basically a shortcut to the [[CPU socket]], not a bus&amp;mdash;which also meant that parts for the PDS slot were tied to a specific Macintosh model, with the notable exception of the LC PDS slot, which was standardized across the entire LC line. The PDS slot could be used for processor upgrades, the [[Apple IIe Card]], or video cards. The last line of Macintoshes to have PDS slots was the first generation of the PowerMacs. The first Macintosh to feature a bus for expansion was the Macintosh II, in the form of six [[NuBus]] (parallel 32-bit bus) slots. The NuBus was abandoned in favor of [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] in the second-generation Power Macs, and the G4 added an [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] slot for video cards. The latest G5s use [[PCI Express]] for graphics and expansion. For memory, Apple has used standard [[SIMM]]s (30 and 72-pin) and later [[DIMM]]s, with the notable exception of the Macintosh IIfx, which used special and very rare 64-pin SIMMs. Currently, the top-of-the-line G5 PowerMacs use 240-pin [[DDR2 SDRAM]] DIMMs.

The earliest Macintoshes used a special proprietary serial port for external floppy or hard drives, until SCSI was introduced with the Macintosh Plus. SCSI remained the Macintosh drive connection of choice until the PowerMac G3, when less expensive [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]] drives became standard. Current PowerMacs use [[Serial ATA|SATA]] for internal hard drives, ATA for internal optical drives and FireWire (or USB) for external drives. For peripherals, the Apple Desktop Bus was introduced with the Macintosh II. It was the standard input connector until the Universal Serial Bus was introduced with the iMac. The last Macintosh to have ADB was the blue and white PowerMac G3 though the PCI-based G4 (the Yikes! board) had the circuitry for it. Other legacy Macintosh peripheral connectors include the serial [[GeoPort]] and the [[Apple Attachment Unit Interface|AAUI]] port for networking. For external video signals, Apple used a [[D-subminiature|DB-15]] connector on all models prior to the blue and white G3, which uses a [[VGA connector]]; the VGA was in turn dropped in favor of the [[Apple Display Connector]] in the PowerMac G4. On the most recent Macintoshes, Apple has used a standard or dual-link [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] connector.

== Software ==
=== Operating system ===
{{main|Mac OS history}}
[[Image:Apple Macintosh Desktop.png|thumb|250px|The original 1984 [[Mac OS]] desktop with the radically new [[graphical user interface]].]]
[[Image:System7screenshot.gif|thumb|250px|[[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7]] was the first major upgrade of the Macintosh operating system. Note that the display is in 8-bit color.]]
[[Image:MacOSX10.4.png|thumb|250px|The [[Mac OS X v10.4]] &quot;Tiger&quot; desktop. Although the interface has undergone many changes, some aspects remain, such as the [[menu bar]] at the top of the screen.]]

The Macintosh operating system was originally known as the ''System Software'' or more simply ''System''. With the release of System 7.6, the official name became Mac OS. From 2001, the &quot;classic&quot; Mac OS was phased out in favor of the new BSD Unix-based Mac OS X. Apple had offered another UNIX system, [[A/UX]], for its Macintosh servers earlier, but without much success. The Mac OS operating system is widely considered one of the main selling points of the Macintosh platform, and Apple heavily touts its releases with large special events and release-day events. Apple has generally chosen to stick with some loose user-interface elements in all of its releases, and many similarities can be seen between the legacy Mac OS 9 and the modern Mac OS X. Non-Apple operating systems for today’s Macintoshes include Linux and free BSD variants.

Mac OS was the first widely used operating system with a graphical interface. No versions of the &quot;classic&quot; Mac OS featured a [[command line interface]]. It was originally a single-tasking OS, but optional [[co-operative multitasking]] was introduced in System 5. The next major upgrade was [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7]] in 1991, which featured a new full-color design, built-in multitasking, [[AppleScript]], and more user configuration options. Mac OS continued to evolve up to version 9.2.2, but its dated architecture&amp;mdash;such as using cooperative multitasking instead of the more modern [[Computer multitasking|preemptive multitasking]]&amp;mdash;made a replacement necessary.

In March 2001, Apple introduced Mac OS X, a modern and more secure Unix-based successor, using [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], [[XNU]] and [[Mach kernel|Mach]] as foundations. Mac OS X is directly derived from NeXTSTEP, the operating system developed by Steve Jobs' company NeXT before Apple bought it. Older Mac OS programs can still run under Mac OS X in a special [[virtual machine]] called Classic, but this is only possible on Macintoshes using PowerPC processors, not on Macintoshes using Intel processors. A program similar to Classic called &quot;Rosetta&quot; will allow PowerPC programs to run on Intel machines. Even though Mac OS X was never certified as a UNIX implementation by [[The Open Group]], it is now the most common Unix-based desktop operating system. Mac OS X is currently at version 10.4 (released on [[April 29]] [[2005]]), code-named ''Tiger''. The next version, [[Mac OS X v10.5]], code-named ''Leopard'', is scheduled to be released at the end of 2006.

=== Software history ===
Since its introduction, the Mac has been criticized for the lack of software available for its operating system. In 1984 it was apparent that a wider range of software was available for the [[IBM PC]], because it used the most popular operating system of the time, [[MS-DOS]]. Apple struggled to encourage software developers to port software titles to the Macintosh; however, [[Bill Gates]] at Microsoft realized that the [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] would become an industry standard, and that his software would sell in large quantity if it were available for the Macintosh. In 1984 [[Microsoft Word]] and [[Multiplan|Microsoft MultiPlan]] were available, and were a large selling point for the Mac. However, it lacked other business software and games. In 1985, [[Lotus Software]] introduced [[Lotus Jazz]] after the success of [[Lotus 1-2-3]] for the IBM PC, although it was largely a flop.

In 1987, Apple spun off its software business as [[Claris]]. It was given the code and rights to several programs that had been written within Apple, notably MacWrite, MacPaint and [[MacProject]]. In the late 1980s, Claris released a number of revamped software titles; the result was the &quot;Pro&quot; series, including MacPaint Pro, MacDraw Pro, MacWrite Pro and FileMaker Pro. To provide a complete office suite, Claris purchased the rights to the [[Informix Wingz]] [[spreadsheet]] on the Mac, renaming it [[Claris Resolve]], and added the new presentation program [[Claris Impact]]. By the early 1990s, Claris programs were shipping with the majority of consumer-level Macintoshes and were extremely popular. In 1991, Claris released [[AppleWorks|ClarisWorks]], which soon became their second best-selling program. When Claris was later folded back into Apple, ClarisWorks was renamed AppleWorks beginning with version 5.0.

Today, all Macs come prepackaged with a suite of consumer-level applications.  In 1999, a digital video editing application, [[iMovie]], was released for use on the [[iMac|iMac DV]]. Next came [[iTunes]], a digital jukebox designed to work with Apple’s iPod digital music player, and on [[January 7]], [[2002]], Apple released [[iPhoto]], an easy-to-use digital photo organizer. In 2004, Apple began to market these applications, along with [[iDVD]] and [[GarageBand]], as a $49 suite called &quot;iLife.&quot; It is intended to make the Mac versatile out of the box by providing several high-value consumer media applications. The most popular tool in the suite is iTunes, now in a Windows version as well, and has spawned the most popular online music store, the [[iTunes Music Store]]. In January 2006, iLife '06 was released; [[iWeb]], a new website creation application, was added to the suite and the price was increased to $79.

== Advertising ==
[[Image:MacIntroBrochurePage1.jpg|thumb|250px|Page 1 of the 1984 &quot;Macintosh Introduction&quot; brochure published in ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine.]]Ever since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 commercial]], Apple has been recognized for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for the Macintosh. A &quot;Macintosh Introduction&quot; 20-page brochure was included with various magazines in December 1983, often remembered because Bill Gates was featured on page 15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digibarn.com/collections/ads/apple-mac/index.htm DigiBarn Ads: Original Apple Macintosh 18 Page Brochure (Dec 1983)], retrieved [[November 26]], [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; For a special post-election edition of ''[[Newsweek]]'' in November 1984, Apple spent more than US $2.5 million to buy all of the advertising pages in the issue (a total of 39).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidebookgallery.org/ads/magazines/macos/macos10-newsweek GUIdebook: Macintosh ads], retrieved [[November 26]], [[2005]] and http://www.macmothership.com/gallery/gallerytextindex.html, retrieved [[December 9]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Apple also ran a &quot;Test Drive a Macintosh&quot; promotion that year, in which potential buyers with a credit card could trial a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. It began to look like a success with 200,000 participants, and ''Advertising Age'' magazine named this one of the 10 best promotions of 1984. However, dealers disliked the promotion and supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many computers were returned in such a bad shape that they could no longer be sold. 

In 1985 the &quot;Lemmings&quot; commercial aired at the [[Super Bowl]]; Apple went as far as to create a newspaper advertisement stating &quot;If you go to the bathroom during the fourth quarter, you'll be sorry.&quot; It was a large failure and did not capture nearly as much attention as the 1984 commercial did. Many more brochures for new models like the Macintosh Plus and the Performa followed. In the 1990s Apple started the &quot;What's on your PowerBook?&quot; campaign, with print ads and television commercials featuring persons describing how the PowerBook helps them in their businesses and everyday lives. These included [[Frances Lear]], [[Tama Janowitz]], [[Michael O'Brien]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Art Monk]], [[Martina Navrátilová]], [[Brian Durkin]], and [[Henry Rollins]]. In 1995 Apple responded to the introduction of Windows 95 with both several print ads and a television commercial demonstrating its disadvantages and lack of innovation. In 1997 the [[Think Different]] campaign introduced Apple's new slogan, and in 2002 the [[Apple Switch ad campaign|Switch campaign]] followed.

Today, Apple focuses much of its advertising efforts around heavily hyped &quot;special events,&quot; and [[Stevenote|keynotes]] at conferences like the [[Apple Expo]] and the [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|MacWorld Expo]]. The events typically draw a large gathering of media representatives and spectators. In the past, special events have been used to unveil the [[Power Mac G5]], the redesigned iMac, and many other Macintosh products.

== Effects on the technology industry ==
Apple has introduced a number of innovations in direct relation to the [[Macintosh 128K]] that were later adopted by the rest of industry as a standard for the design of computers. Possibly Apple's number-one effect on the industry was the first large-scale use of a graphical user interface in operating system software. Today, almost every mainstream operating system relies on a graphical user interface, and many operating systems still echo the design of the original Macintosh graphical user interface, such as the use of the &quot;double click,&quot; &quot;drag and drop,&quot; and the mouse used for them. The Macintosh 128K also introduced software which allowed [[WYSIWYG]] (what you see is what you get) text and graphics editing, alongside significant technical improvements such as long file names permitting [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] and not requiring a [[file extension]], [[floppy disk|3.5&quot; floppy disk drives]] as a standard component, 8-bit mono [[Sound|audio]] including built-in speakers, and an output jack as a standard feature.

The Macintosh platform has introduced many innovations and ideas that had significant effects on the computer industry, especially in the area of communications standards. One of the first was the Macintosh Plus, which successfully introduced the SCSI interface in 1986. The Macintosh IIsi and the Macintosh LC introduced standard audio in and out ports in 1990&amp;mdash;today these ports are standard on the large majority of computers. Beginning with the iMac in 1998, Apple made the Universal Serial Bus standard and introduced FireWire, a high-speed data transfer bus now popular in media-editing computers and almost all digital video cameras. Apple also innovated in the area of networking, with heavy marketing and early implementation of the existing wireless networking standard [[IEEE 802.11]]b ([[AirPort]]) in the Macintosh portable lines in 1999. Additionally, the Macintosh platform introduced many of the storage devices that are now standard: In 1992, the [[Macintosh IIvx]] was the first computer to feature the [[CD-ROM]] drive as a standard feature. The iMac, debuting in 1998, was one of the first computers to have no floppy disk drive; today, almost no new computers come with one. Finally, the [[Power Macintosh G4]] with its ''SuperDrive'' introduced the first relatively affordable [[DVD-R]] drive in 2001.

Apple has also contributed heavily to the field of mobile computing, and many features of their mobile computers have become the norm. The PowerBook 100, 140, and 170 set the ergonomic standard for the placement of the keyboard in 1991 by moving the keyboard behind a palm rest, rather than right at the bottom of the laptop. In 1991 the PowerBook 100 series featured the first built-in pointing device on a laptop: a trackball. The [[PowerBook Duo]] also introduced the idea of a dock/port replicator in 1992. One of the most important features ever added to the Macintosh PowerBook lineup was the first true [[touchpad]] as a pointing device on the PowerBook 500 in 1994; today, most laptops rely on it as their pointing device. More recently, the [[PowerBook G4]] became the first full-size laptop computer to feature a widescreen display, in 2003 it became the first laptop computer with a 17-inch display, and in 2004 it became the first laptop computer to provide dual-link DVI.

There is much speculation as to why so many Macintosh features have been adopted by competitors. And although they have a history of including some of the best technology available to the consumer market, Macs- and their components- are often much more expensive than Windows PCs; as such, one could argue that Macintoshes brought what was to become standard earlier at a higher cost, and it is certainly true that it costs far more to develop something than to copy it &amp;mdash; both in terms of actual resources, and &quot;man-hours.&quot; Another view is that competitors were forced to copy the Macintosh for reasons of competition and business, and whether such innovations were superior is irrelevant. Mac advocates argue that their products are simply better.

== Market share and demographics ==
Since the introduction of the Macintosh 128K in 1984, Apple has struggled to gain a significant share of the personal computer market. At first, the Macintosh lacked software, resulting in disappointing sales in 1985, when consumers realized that more software was available for the IBM PC. By 1985, only 500,000 Macs had been sold. Jobs had originally predicted that five million units would be sold within two years; sales eventually crossed the two million mark in 1988, and three years later, the installed base finally reached five million. By 1997, there were more than 20 million Mac users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://developer.apple.com/adcnews/pastissues/devnews121997.html#stats Apple Developer News December 19, 1997, No. 87]&lt;/ref&gt; By late 2003, Apple had 2.06% of the desktop share in the United States, which had increased to 2.88% by Q4 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Dalrymple]], [[Macworld]] ([[March 20]], 2005): [http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/03/20/marketshare/index.php ''Apple desktop market share on the rise; will the Mac mini, iPod help?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual [[installed base]] of Macintosh computers is extremely hard to determine, with numbers ranging from a conservative 3%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pegasus3d.com/osshare.html pegasus3d.com: Analysis of Google's zeitgeist reports]&lt;/ref&gt; to an optimistic 16%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Slashdot]] (June 2005): [http://apple.slashdot.org/apple/05/06/05/0548225.shtml?tid=3 ''Mac Install-Base Shown to Be 16%'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from an unusually artistic, creative, and well-educated population, which may explain the platform's visibility within certain youthful, avant-garde subcultures.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.com.com/2100-1040-943519.html&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[conventional wisdom]] holds that the platform appeals especially to the politically [[liberal]]-minded; even Steve Jobs speculates that &quot;maybe a little less&quot; than half of Apple's customers are [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s, &quot;maybe more Dell than ours.&quot;  This particular stereotype is reinforced, surely, by the company's pattern of political donations, by [[Al Gore]]’s membership on its board, and not least by Jobs’ personal history.  Nevertheless, well-known Mac users include the likes of conservative talk radio host [[Rush Limbaugh]], an outspoken [[Apple evangelist]], and even current U.S. President [[George W. Bush]].

== Advantages, disadvantages and criticisms ==
The Macintosh differs in several ways from personal computers that run Microsoft Windows. Both the hardware and bundled software, including the operating system, are manufactured by Apple Computer, whereas Microsoft supplies their software to [[original equipment manufacturer]]s, including [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and IBM, who make the hardware using a wider range of components. This results in a limited range of Mac models compared with a huge variety of Windows-based PCs; however, it reduces conflicts between software and hardware and has helped Apple's reputation for stability and reliability. The Unix-based operating system performs multi-user networking as standard. This less common operating system means that a much smaller range of third-party software is available, although suitable applications, such as [[Microsoft Office]], are available in most areas. The design of the Macintosh operating system, as well as the vigilance of users,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gruber]], [[Daring Fireball]] ([[June 4]], 2004): [http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/broken_windows ''Broken Windows'']&lt;/ref&gt; has contributed to the near-absence of the types of [[malware]] and [[spyware]] that plague Microsoft Windows users.

Apple has a history of innovation and making bold changes that is met by strong uptake of software upgrades. The Classic application allows users to run &quot;old&quot; (Mac OS 9) applications on OS X computers, often as well as they ran natively on Mac OS 9, though without the advantages of a native OS X application. The Apple Intel transition starting in 2006 will not support ''Classic'' on new Intel Macs, and purchasers of these computers who are still using Classic applications will have to replace or upgrade this software. The transition will involve the recompilation of most OS X software to maximize performance; in the interim, unmodified OS X applications can run on the Intel chip under the emulation software &quot;Rosetta&quot;.

For much of the Mac's history, up until the introduction of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] Power Macs, Macintosh hardware was notoriously closed. Connectors were proprietary, requiring specialized peripherals or adapter cables, and the hardware architecture was so closely tied to the Mac OS that it was impossible to boot an alternative operating system; the most common workaround, used even by Apple for its [[A/UX]] Unix implementation, was to boot into Mac OS and then to hand over control to a program that took over the system and acted as a [[Booting|boot loader]]. Current implementations for older hardware of operating systems such as [[Linux]] and [[NetBSD]] do the same thing, though they use their own programs instead of Apple's. This technique is not necessary on [[Open Firmware|OpenFirmware]]-based PCI Macs, though it was formerly used for convenience on many [[Old World ROM]] systems due to bugs in the firmware implementation. (An alternate technique, used by Tenon's [[MachTen]] and the Mac port of [[Minix]], was to run the alternate OS as a process within the Mac OS.) Modern Mac hardware boots directly from OpenFirmware or [[Extensible Firmware Interface|EFI]], and is not limited to the Mac OS.

Apple's choice of a hybrid [[microkernel]] architecture for Mac OS X has been unpopular in some quarters due to performance inefficiencies inherent in the microkernel design paradigm. Apple attempted to reduce the impact of microkernel overhead by moving userspace subsystems into the kernel space along with the microkernel, but a vocal minority of Mac developers feel that Apple should move to a monolithic kernel similar to Linux to eliminate microkernel overhead entirely.

== Litigation ==
{{main|Notable litigation of Apple Computer}}
There have been many lawsuits centered around the Macintosh. These generally involve [[copyright infringement]] of the computer's [[look and feel]] and [[trademark]]s. While many suits have been successful, Apple lost its [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.|major case]] against the Microsoft Windows interface.

''[[Pirates of Silicon Valley]]'', a film adaptation of the litigation, closely follows actual events. It is a semi-humorous documentary about the men who made the world of technology what it is today, their struggles during college, the founding of their companies, and the actions they took to build up the global corporate empires of Apple and Microsoft. It stars [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as [[Bill Gates]] and [[Noah Wyle]] as Steve Jobs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ann Noreen Widdecombe''' (born [[October 4]], [[1947]], in [[Bath]], [[Somerset]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[politician]]. She is the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Maidstone and The Weald (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone and The Weald]], a [[Privy Counsellor]], and an outspoken supporter of traditional [[family values]]. She holds Honours degrees in [[Latin]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] [[University of Birmingham]]) and in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] ([[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|MA]] [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]]).

From 1976 to 1978, Widdecombe was a [[Runnymede (borough)|Runnymede District]] [[Councillor]]. She contested the seat of [[Burnley (UK Parliament constituency)|Burnley]] in 1979, and then [[Plymouth Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Devonport]] in 1983 against [[David Owen]]. She was first elected to the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 UK general election]] as member for the constituency of Maidstone (which became ''Maidstone and The Weald'' in 1997). 

She became the [[Home Office]] Minister in Charge of Prisons in [[John Major]]'s government and in that role visited every single prison. After the fall of the Conservative government to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] in 1997 she served as shadow [[Health Secretary]] and later shadow [[Home Secretary]] under [[William Hague]], but has since retired to the backbenches.

When the voters of [[Eastbourne (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastbourne]] returned a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] candidate, in the [[by-election]] caused by the assassination of [[Ian Gow]], she told them &quot;the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] would be toasting their success&quot;.

She is famous for her claim of [[celibacy]] and her outspoken [[conservatism]], and her views concerning [[abortion]] and [[recreational drugs]], which some consider to be antiquated. She made headlines for her policy of applying the standards for handcuffing prisoners in transit to pregnant women, even on visits to hospitals. She claimed that this was necessary because of the risk of their absconding. Along with [[John Gummer]] MP and approximately 400 [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] priests, she converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1993, in the wake of the decision to [[ordain]] women into the [[Church of England]].
She had been educated at a Roman Catholic convent school in [[Bath]], La Sainte Union, despite the fact that her family were not Roman Catholics, because her parents wanted to ensure that she received a good education in a single-sex school. 

During the Conservative leadership election that picked [[William Hague]] she spoke against [[Michael Howard]], under whom she had served when he was [[Home Secretary]]. She remarked &quot;there is something of the night about him&quot; and it is for this remark she is probably most (in)famous. It was considered to be extremely damaging, and Howard came last in that 1997 poll. However, he went on to become party leader in 2003 and some of Howard's more cunning supporters at that time claimed she had meant &quot;there is something of the knight about him&quot;.

She scored an [[own goal]] in calling for a [[zero tolerance]] policy of prosecution for users of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in her speech at the 2000 Conservative conference, which was well-received by rank-and-file Conservative delegates. However, she alleges that someone connected with [[Francis Maude]] promptly contacted journalists to alert them that fellow Conservative cabinet members were prepared to come out and indicate ''something of ambivalence'' towards their own past experiences with this drug.

During the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2001|2001 Conservative leadership election]], after the resignation of [[William Hague]] in the wake of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 UK general election]], she could not find sufficient Conservative MPs to support her as a leadership candidate. She supported the unsuccessful leadership campaign of [[Ken Clarke]], and afterwards refused to serve in a Duncan Smith cabinet. 

It is alleged that in preparation for that contest she began the process of softening her image and raising her political profile, but that process appears to be continuing today despite the subsequent selection of [[Iain Duncan Smith]] as the Conservative party leader. Her fellow Conservative MPs and political opponents have been cruel at times about her appearance, dubbing her &quot;Doris Karloff&quot; in reference to horror film actor [[Boris Karloff]]. In 2003, together with another Roman Catholic M.P. [[Edward Leigh]], she proposed an [[constitutional amendment|amendment]] opposing repeal of [[Section 28]] of the [[Local Government Act 1988|Local Government Act]], which banned the promotion of homosexuality.

As a strong, forceful, and clever woman, Widdecombe is arguably a peculiar [[England|English]] [[sex symbol]], and her admirers include [[Bob Geldof]] and [[Eddie Izzard]]. During the 2001 UK general election, ''I Love Ann Widdecombe'' underwear was the top-selling item at Politico's Bookstore, a London shop devoted to political merchandise.

Her non-political accomplishments include being a popular [[novelist]]. In March of 2004 she briefly became the Guardian newspaper's [[agony aunt]], introduced with an [[Emma Brockes]] interview [http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,1179972,00.html]. In 2002, she took part in the ITV programme ''[[Celebrity Fit Club]]''. In 2005 BBC Two showed six episodes of The Widdecombe Project, an agony aunt television program. In 2005 she also appeared in [[Celebrity Fit Club]] but this time as a panel member dispensing wisdom and advice to the celebrities taking part.

She has never married and lives with her widowed mother in [[Newington]], [[London]].

In late 2005, she announced her intention to stand down as Member of Parliament for Maidstone and The Weald at the next General Election.

Aurangzeb (from [[Persian language|Persian]], اورنگ‌زیب meaning &quot;befitting the throne&quot;),([[November 3]], [[1618]] &amp;ndash; [[March 3]], [[1707]], also known as '''Alamgir I''', was the ruler of the [[Mughal Empire]] from 1658 until 1707. He was and is a very controversial figure in [[India]]n history. 

Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb led a remarkably austere and pious life. Strict adherence to [[Islam]] and [[Sharia]] (Islamic law)&amp;mdash;as he interpreted them&amp;mdash;were the foundations of his reign. He backed up his faith with action, abandoning the religious tolerance of his predecessors. During his reign many [[Hindu]] temples were defaced and destroyed, and many [[India]]ns converted to [[Islam]].

Aurangzeb used vast military might to expand and consolidate the Mughal empire, at high cost.  His rule inspired revolt which he constrained during his life, but which exploded and completely changed India after his death. His policies polarized India in ways that continue to this day.

==Rise to throne==
===Early life===
Aurangzeb (full name: ''Abu Muzaffar Muhiuddin Muhammad Aurangzeb Alamgir'' --[[Persian language|Persian]]: بو مظفر محی الدین محمد اورنگزیب عالمگیر )  was the third son of the fifth great [[Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]] (builder of the [[Taj Mahal]]), and
Arjumand Banu Begum (also known as [[Mumtaz Mahal]]). After a rebellion by his father, part of Aurangzeb's childhood was spent as a kind of hostage at his grandfather [[Jahangir]]'s court.

After Jahangir's death in [[1627]], Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents. Shah Jahan followed the Mughal practice of assigning authority to his sons,  and in [[1634]] made Aurangzeb [[Subahdar]] (governor) of the [[Deccan]]. He moved to Kirki, which in time he renamed [[Aurangabad]]. In [[1637]], he married, Rabia Daurrani – her tomb is in Aurangabad. During this period the Deccan was relatively peaceful. In the Mughal court, however, Shah Jahan began to show greater and greater favoritism to his eldest son [[Dara Shikoh]]. 

In [[1644]], Aurangzeb's sister [[Jahanara Begum]] was accidently burned in [[Agra]]. This event precipitated a family crisis which had political consequences. Aurangzeb suffered his father's displeasure when returning to Agra three weeks after the event rather than coming immediately after hearing of the accident. Shah Jahan dismissed him as the governor of Deccan. Aurangzeb later claimed ([[1654]]) to have resigned the post in protest of his father favoring Dara.

Aurangzeb's fortunes continued to decline. In [[1645]], he was barred from the court for seven months. After this incident, Shah Jahan appointed him governor of [[Gujarat]]. He performed well and was rewarded. In [[1647]], Shah Jahan made him governor of [[Balkh]] and [[Badakhshan]] (near modern [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]), replacing Aurangzeb's ineffective brother [[Murad Baksh]]. These areas were at the time under attack from a variety of forces. Aurangzeb's military skill proved successful, and the story of how he spread his prayer rug and prayed in the midst of battle brought him much fame.

He was appointed governor of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]] and began a protracted military struggle against the Persian army in an effort to capture the city of [[Kandahar]]. He failed, and fell again into his father's disfavor.

In [[1652]], Aurangzeb was again appointed governor of the [[Deccan]]. Both man and place had changed in the interim. The Deccan produced poor tax revenue for the Mughals. As a youth in his previous term, Aurangzeb ignored the problem, allowing state-sanctioned corruption and extortion to grow. This time Aurangzeb set about reforming the system, but his efforts often placed additional burdens on the locals, and were poorly received. 

It was during this second governorship that Aurangzeb first recounts destroying a [[Hindu]] temple. He also forbade the temple dancers ([[devadasi|devadasis]]) from their practice of &quot;sacred prostitution&quot;. In addition, Aurangzeb's officers began treating non-Muslims harshly, and he defended these practices in letters to Shah Jahan's court. These practices would become themes in Aurangzeb's rule as emperor.

In an effort to raise additional revenues, Aurangzeb attacked the border kingdoms of [[Golconda]] ([[1657]]), and [[Bijapur]] ([[1658]]). In both instances, Shah Jahan called off the attacks near the moment of Aurangzeb's triumph. Even at the time it was believed that the withdrawals had actually been ordered by Prince Dara, in Shah Jahan's name.

===War of succession===
'''[[Shah Jahan]]''' fell ill in [[1657]], and was widely reported to have died. With this news,  the struggle for succession began. Aurangzeb's eldest brother, [[Dara Shikoh]], was regarded as heir apparent, but the succession proved far from certain.

On news of the Shah Jahan's supposed death, his second son, [[Shah Shuja]] declared himself emperor in [[Bengal]]. Imperial armies sent by Dara and Shah Jahan soon restrained this effort, and Shuja retreated. 

Soon after, however his youngest brother [[Murad Baksh]], with secret promises of support from Aurangzeb, declared himself emperor in [[Gujarat]]. 

Aurangzeb, ostensibly in support of Murad, marched north from Aurangabad, gathering support from nobles and generals. Following a series of victories, Aurangzeb declared that Dara had illegally usurped the throne. Shah Jahan, determined that Dara would succeed him, handed over control of the empire to Dara.

[[Maharaja Jaswant Singh]] opposed Aurangzeb at Dharmatpur near [[Ujjain]].

Later a series of bloody battles followed, with troops loyal to Aurangzeb battering Dara's armies. Aurangzeb's forces surrounded [[Agra]]. Fearing for his life, Dara departed [[Agra]] for [[Delhi]], leaving Shah Jahan. The old emperor surrendered the [[Agra Fort|Red Fort]] of Agra to Aurangzeb's nobles, but Aurangzeb refused any meeting with his father, declaring that Dara was his enemy. 

In a sudden reversal, Aurangzeb then had Murad arrested. Murad's supporters fled to Aurangzeb.

Meanwhile Dara gathered his forces, and set up an alliance with Shuja. But the key commander of Dara's armies, the [[Rajput]] general [[Jai Singh]], defected to Aurangzeb, along with many thousand Rajput soldiers. 

Dara fled Delhi, and sought an alliance with Shuja. But Shuja pretended to drop his claim to emperor after Aurangzeb offered him the governorship of [[Bengal]]. This move had the affect of isolating Dara and causing some troops to defect to Aurangzeb. 

Shuja, however, uncertain of Aurangzeb's sincerity, continued to battle Aurangzeb. His forces suffered a series of defeats at Aurangzeb's hands. At length, Shuja went into exile in [[Arakan]] (in present-day [[Myanmar]]) where he disappeared, and was presumed to be dead.

With Shuhja and Murad disposed of, and with Shah Jahan confined in Agra, Aurangzeb pursued Dara, chasing him across what is now northwest India, [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. After a series of battles, defeats and retreats, Dara was betrayed by one of his generals, who arrested and bound him.

In [[1659]], Aurangzeb arranged a formal coronation in [[Delhi]]. He had Dara openly marched in chains back to Delhi;  when Dara finally arrived, he had him executed. Legends about the cruelty of this execution abound, including stories that Aurangzeb had Dara's severed head sent to Shah Jahan.

Aurangzeb kept Shah Jahan under house arrest at the Red Fort in Agra. Legends concerning this imprisonment abound, for the fort is ironically close to Shah Jahan's great architectural masterpiece,  the [[Taj Mahal]]. More details of these legends may be found in the article on [[Shah Jahan]].

==Aurangzeb's Reign==
[[Image:Aurangzeb2.jpg|frame|right|Portrait as emperor]]
===Enforcement of Islamic law===
The Mughals had for the most part been tolerant of non-Muslims, allowing them to practice their customs and religion without too much interference. Though certain Muslim laws had been in place during earlier reigns -- prohibitions against building new Hindu temples, for example, or on the tax on non-Muslims (the [[Jizyah]]), enforcement by earlier emperors had been lax, encouraging a political tolerance toward non-Muslims. 

Up until Aurangzeb's reign, [[India]]n [[Islam]] had been informed by mystical [[Sufi]] precepts. Although Sunni in ancestry, the Emperors from [[Humayun]] on had tolerated or openly embraced the activities of the [[Chisti]] Sufis. But Aurangzeb abandoned many of the more liberal viewpoints of his Mughal ancestors. He espoused a more conservative interpretation of Islamic principles, and behavior based on the [[Sharia]], which he set about codifying through edicts and policies. His [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], a 33 volume compilation of these edicts, established the precedent for civil law based on Sharia, which has influenced Islamic governments to the present day.

Under Aurangzeb, Mughal court life changed dramatically. According to his interpretation, Islam did not allow [[music]], so he banished court musicians, dancers and singers. Further, based on Muslim precepts forbidding images, he stopped the production of representational artwork, including the miniature painting that had reached its zenith before his rule. Soldiers and citizens were also given free rein to deface architectural images -- such as faces, flowers and vines -- even on the walls of  Mughal palaces. Untold thousands of images were destroyed in this way. Aurangzeb gave up the Hindu-inspired practices of former Mughal emperors, especially the practice of 'darshan', or public appearances to bestow blessings, that had been commonplace since the time of Akbar. 

Aurangzeb began to enact and enforce a series of edicts -- with less tolerance for non-Muslims, and with harsh punishments . Most significantly, Aurangzeb initiated laws which specifically interfered with non-Muslim worship. These included the destruction of non-Muslim worship sites, a prohibition of non-Muslim religious gatherings,collection of [[jizya]] tax, the closing of non-Muslim religious schools, and  prohibitions of specific Hindu practices such as [[sati]] (self-immolation by widows), and temple dance. Often the punishment for breaking such laws was death. 

In such a climate of fierce enforcement, the Mughal infrastructure became arbitrary and corrupt. In consequence, instead of acceptance and tolerance, non-Muslims began to feel persecuted and fearful. These feelings  would lead in many instances to open political and military rebellion.

===Expansion of the empire===
From the start of his reign up until his death, Aurangzeb engaged in nearly constant warfare. He built up a massive army, and began a program of military expansion at all the boundaries of his empire.

Aurangzeb pushed into the northwest -- into [[Punjab region|Punjab]], and what is now [[Afghanistan]]. He also drove south, conquering [[Bijapur]] and [[Golconda]], his old enemies. He further attempted to suppress the [[Maratha]] territories, which had recently been liberated from Bijapur by [[Shivaji]]. 

But the combination of military expansion and political intolerance had far deeper consequences. Though he succeeded in expanding Mughal control, it was at an enormous cost in lives and treasure. And as the empire expanded in size, the chain of command grew weaker. 

The [[Sikh]]s of Punjab grew both in strength and numbers in rebellion against Aurangzeb's armies. When the tolerant Muslim kingdoms of Golconda and Bijapur fell beneath Aurangzeb's might, rebellious Hindus flocked to join [[Shivaji]] and the [[Maratha Confederacy]].  For the last 20 years of his life, Aurangzeb engaged in constant battles in the [[Deccan]], at enormous expense. 

Even Aurangzeb's own armies grew restive -- particularly the fierce [[Rajput]]s who were his main source of strength. Aurangzeb gave a wide berth to the Rajputs, who were mostly Hindu. While they fought for Aurangzeb during his life, immediately upon his death they revolted against the Empire.

With so much of his attention on military matters, Aurangzeb's political influence waned, and his provincial governors and generals grew in authority.

===Conversion of non-Muslims===
During Aurangzeb's reign many Indians converted to Islam. 

&quot;Aurangzeb's ultimate aim was conversion of non-Muslims to Islam. Whenever possible the emperor gave out robes of honor, cash gifts, and promotions to converts. It quickly became known that conversion was a sure way to the emperor's favor.&quot; (John F. Richards, p. 177 [http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Mughals/Aurang2.html UCLA History of South Asia]).

It has been said that Aurangzeb forcefully converted people, though this may be a matter of interpretation and exaggeration. There can be no question, however, that in economic and political terms, his rule significantly favored Muslims over non-Muslims, or that he specifically attempted to interfere with non-Muslim religious practice through sweeping and often violent methods. 

While Aurangzeb clearly created a climate favorable for conversion -- the carrot of the emperor's favor coupled with the stick of harsh policies -- other factors come into play. No other emperor did so much to impose Islam. No other emperor was so firm in his beliefs or so consistent in his actions. 

While some conversions were likely based only on practical considerations, clearly others converted out of sincere belief -- at least in part inspired by Aurangzeb.

===Hindu temple desecration=== 
No aspect of Aurangzeb's reign is more cited -- or more controversial -- than the numerous desecrations and destruction of Hindu temples. 

During his reign, many hundreds -- perhaps many thousands -- of temples were desecrated: facades and interiors were defaced and their [[murti]]s (idols) looted. In many cases, temples were destroyed entirely; in numerous instances mosques were built on their foundations, sometimes using the same stones.

His edicts show that he authorized and encouraged these acts. Much controversy remains about his motivation. Scholars primarily take two views, saying that destruction was predicated : 
*  by political and military events, typically as punishment for rebellion and for the display of Imperial power only, and that once the point had been made, destruction stopped
Or
* by Islamic precepts, and without regard to political consequences 

There is evidence to support both views, much of it seemingly contradictory -- for example records showing that Aurangzeb authorized subsidies to some temples at the same time as he was destroying others. (A third view, held by some scholars, is that Aurangzeb was motivated by a desire to root out corruption and crime associated with temples.) 

Whatever his motivation, among the temples Aurangzeb destroyed were two most sacred to Hindus, in [[Varanasi]] and [[Mathura]]. In both cases, he had large mosques built on the sites. 

The Kesava Deo temple in Mathura, marked the place Hindus believe was the birth place of Shri [[Krishna]]. The temple had large, gilded spires that could be seen from Agra. In [[1661]] Aurangzeb ordered the demolition of the temple, and constructed the Katra Masjid mosque. Traces of the ancient Hindu temple can be seen from the back of the mosque. 

Aurangzeb also destroyed what was the most famous temple in Varanasi, [[Vishwanath Temple]], dedicated to Shiva. The temple had changed location over the years, but in [[1585]] [[Akbar]] had authorized its location at [[Gyan Vapi]]. Aurangzeb ordered its demolition in [[1669]] and constructed a mosque on the site, whose minarets stand 71 metres above the [[Ganges]]. Traces of the old temple can be seen behind the mosque. 

Aurangzeb was an intolerant tyrant, power thirsty. Precursor of September 11, he was already doing that in India destroying temples and killing his people. To get to power he killed his siblings and emprisioned his father. He was just a bloody tyrant, he had not respect for honor nor moral.  

Centuries later, emotional debate about these acts continue.

==Impact of Aurangzeb's reign==
As a reaction to Aurangzeb's political and religious expansionist policies, and to his discriminatory laws, a momentous change occurred in India.  India's politics had been previously based on tribal and geographic boundaries, but now peoples began to identify and align according to their religions. This development would inform all subsequent Indian history.

===Hindu rebellion===
Many Hindu subjects rebelled against Aurangzeb's policies. 

From the beginning of his reign, Aurangzeb permitted and encouraged the defacement and destruction of Hindu temples. Other edicts added to the impact. In [[1665]] he forbade Hindus to display illuminations at Diwali festivals. Hindu religious fairs were outlawed in [[1668]]. The following year he prohibited construction of Hindu temples as well as the repair of old ones. In [[1671]] Aurangzeb issued an order that only Muslims could be landlords of crown lands. He called upon provincial Viceroys to dismiss all Hindu clerks. In [[1674]] certain lands held by Hindus in Gujarat were confiscated. The customs duties levied on merchants was doubled for non-Muslims.  In [[1679]], contrary to the advice of many of his court nobles and theologians, Aurangzeb reimposed the [[Jizya]] or poll tax on non-Muslims. 

In [[1668]] the Hindu [[Jat]]s in the Agra district revolted. Though they suffered horrendous loss of life, the revolt continued for years. In [[1681]], the Jats attacked and desecrated [[Akbar]]'s tomb in [[Sikandra]].

In [[1672]] the [[Satnami]]s, a Hindu sect concentrated in an area near Delhi, staged an armed rebellion, plundering villages and defeating Mughal forces in a press toward Delhi. Aurangzeb sent an army of ten thousand, including his Imperial Guard, and put the rebellion down at great cost of life.

Hindu [[Rajputana]], which had been a loyal Mughal vassal state, grew restive. The Jaipur Rajputs led by Jai Singh continued loyal, but other Rajput kingdoms didn't. With its Maharaja [[Jaswant Singh]] died in [[1679]], Aurangzeb seized control of [[Jodhpur]], destroying many temples. He also moved on Udaipur.  There was never a clear resolution to this war.

Hindu military leaders and their troops banded together in various alliances throughout Aurangzeb's reign, initiating nearly constant battles and bloodshed. Among the most notable alliances was the [[Maratha Confederacy]]. At the same time [[Sikh]]s were forming the militant [[Khalsa]].

===The Deccan wars and the rise of the Marathas===
In the time of Shah Jahan, the Deccan had been controlled by three Muslim kingdoms: Ahmednagar, Bijapur and Golconda. Following a series of battles, Ahmendnagar was effectively divided, with large portions of the kingdom ceded to the Mughals and the balance to Bijapur. One of Ahmednagar's generals, a Hindu [[Maratha]] named [[Shahaji|Shahji]], retreated to Bijapur. Shahji left in behind in [[Pune]] his wife and young son [[Shivaji]]. 

In 1657, while Aurangzeb attacked Golconda and Bijapur, Shivaji, using guerrilla tactics, took control of three Bijapuri forts formerly controlled by his father. With these victories, Shivaji assumed defacto leadership of many independent Maratha clans. The Marathas harried the flanks of the warring Bijapuris and Mughals, gaining weapons, forts, and territories. During the war of succession, Shivaji's small and ill-equipped army survived an all out Bijapuri attack, and Shivaji personally killed the attacking general, [[Afzul Khan]]. With this event, the Marathas transformed into a powerful military force, capturing more and more Bijapuri and Mughal territory.

Following his coronation in [[1659]], Aurangzeb sent his trusted general and maternal uncle [[Shaista Khan]] to the Deccan to recover his lost forts. Shaista Khan drove into Marathi territory, and took up residence in [[Pune]]. In a daring raid, Shivaji retook Pune, even cutting off Shaista Khan's thumb as he fled. Once more the Marathis rallied to his leadership, taking back the territory. 

Aurangzeb for the next few years ignored the rise of the Marathas. Shivaji led by inspiration, not by any official authority, and the Marathas continued to capture forts belonging to both Mughals and Bijapur. At last Aurangzeb sent his Jaipuri general [[Jai Singh]], a Hindu, to attack the Marathas. 

Jai Singh's blistering attacks were so successful that he was able to persuade Shivaji to agree to peace by becoming a Mughal vassal. But when Shivaji and his son accompanied Jai Singh to Agra to meet Aurangzeb, confusion occurred, ending in an altercation at he fealty ceremony. As a result, Shivaji  and his son [[Sambhaji]] were placed under house arrest in Agra, from which they managed to escape.

Shivaji returned to the Deccan, successfully drove out the Mughal armies, and was crowned [[Chhatrapati]] or king of the Maratha confederacy in [[1674]]. While Aurangzeb continued to send troops against him, Shivaji expanded Maratha control throughout the Deccan until his death in [[1680]].

Sambhaji succeeded in [[1681]]. Though he was less effective militarily and politically, Mughal efforts to control the Deccan continued to fail. 

Aurangzeb's son Akbar left the Mughal court and joined with Sambhaji, inspiring some Mughal forces to join the Marathas. Aurangzeb in response moved his court to Aurangabad and took over command of the Deccan campaign. More battles ensued, and Akbar fled to Persia.

Aurangzeb captured [[Sambhaji]] and publicly tortured and killed him in [[1688]]. His brother [[Rajaram]] succeeded, but the confederacy fell into disarray. Surprisingly, however, this collapse provided the Marathas with great military advantage. Maratha Sardars(commanders) raised individual battles against the Mughals, and territory changed hands again and again during years of endless warfare. Since there was no central authority in control, Aurangzeb was forced to contest every inch of territory, at great cost in lives and treasure. Even as Aurangzeb drove west, deep into Maratha territory(notably conquering [[Satara]]), the Marathas expanded attacks eastward into Mughal lands, including Mughal-held [[Malwa]] and [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]. 

Aurangzeb waged continual war for more than two decades with no resolution. After Aurangzeb's death, new leadership arose among the Marathas, who soon became unified under the rule of the [[Peshwa]]s.

===Defiance of the Sikhs and the rise of the Khalsa===
Since its founding by [[Guru Nanak]] in the 1500s, [[Sikh]]ism grew in popularity throughout India, particularly in the Punjab. In the years following the persecution and death of the fifth [[Guru Arjan Dev]] by Aurangzeb's grandfather [[Jahangir]], the Sikhs had become increasingly militant and defiant. 

Early in Aurangzeb's reign, various insurgent groups of Sikhs engaged Mughal troops in increasingly bloody battles. In 1670, the ninth [[Sikh]] Guru, [[Guru Tegh Bahadur|Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji]] encamped in Delhi, receiving large numbers of followers. Aurangzeb regarded this popularity as a potential threat, and determined to subdue it. But Mughal skirmishes with the increasingly militant Sikhs continued.

Sikhs and Kashmiri Pandits recount that in [[1675]] a group of Kashmiri brahmins, who were of the Hindu faith, were being pressured by Muslim authorities to convert to Islam and approached Guru Tegh Bahadur with their dilemma.  To demonstrate a spirit of unity and tolerance, the Guru agreed to help the brahmins: He told them to inform Aurangzeb that the brahmins would convert only if Guru Tegh Bahadur himself was converted.  

His response led to his death. &lt;!-- The Guru and his diciples were tortured by various methods, boiled alive, burned alive, sawn in half and scalped. It is no suprise that there is such an animosity between Hindus and Sikhs with Muslims. --&gt; At length Guru Tegh Bahadur was arrested and beheaded, giving his life to protect the brahmins. His execution infuriated the Sikhs. In response, his son and successor, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] further militarized his followers. Sikhs engaged in numerous battles against the Mughals, and though often outnumbered, succeeded in gaining more and more territory.

Aurangzeb installed his son [[Bahadur Shah]] as governor of the northwest territories, including Sikh-controlled parts of Punjab. The new governor relaxed enforcement of Aurangzeb's edicts, and an uneasy peace ensued.But Gobind Singh had determined that the Sikhs should actively prepare to defend their territories and their faith. In 1699 he established the [[Khalsa]] a Sikh order of &quot;saint-soldiers&quot;, ready to die for their cause. 

This development alarmed not only the Mughals, but the nearby Rajputs. In a temporary alliance, both groups attacked Gobind Singh and his followers. Facing defeat, Gobind Singh asked Aurangzeb for safe passage from their fort in Andrapuhr. Aurangzeb agreed, but as the Sikhs fled, the Mughals attacked in betrayal of the agreement. 

The Mughals killed all four of Gobind Singh's sons and decimated much of the Sikh army. Only Gobind Singh escaped. Gobind Singh sent Aurangzeb an eloquent yet defiant letter entitled the [[Zafarnama]] (''Notification of Victory''), accusing the emperor of treachery, and claiming a moral victory.

On receipt of this letter, Aurangzeb invited Gobind Singh to meet in Ahmednagar, but Aurangzeb died before Gobind Singh arrived.

==Legacy==

Aurangzeb's influence continues through the centuries, affecting not only India, but Asia, and the world. 

He was the first ruler to attempt to impose Sharia law on a non-Muslim country. His critics, principally Sikhs, Buddhists and Hindus, decry this as intolerance. His supporters, mostly Muslims, applaud him, some calling him a [[pir]] or [[Caliph]].

He engaged in nearly perpetual war, justifying the ensuing death and destruction on moral and religious grounds. His one-pointed devotion to conquest and control based on his personal world-view has continuing resonance in our current world. Even now, political groups of all kinds point to his rule to justify their actions. Without much effort, one can follow a direct line from Aurangzeb to many of the political and religious conflicts of the present day. The influence of the Fatawa-e-Alamgiri on future Islamic governments has been considerable.

Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb considered the royal treasury as a trust of the citizens of his empire and that it should not be used for his personal expenses. But his constant warfare drove his empire to the brink of bankruptcy as much as the personal profligacy of earlier emperors had done.

Despite his success in imposing Sharia within his kingdom, he alienated many constituencies, not only non-Muslims, but also native Shias. This led to increased militancy by the Marathas, the Sikhs, and Rajputs, who along with other territories broke from the empire after his death, and to disputes among Indian Muslims. The destruction of Hindu temples remains a source of emotional debate. 

He alienated many of his children and wives, driving some into exile and imprisoning others. At the ebb of his life, he expressed his loneliness, and perhaps, regret. 

In contrast to his predecessors, Aurangzeb left few buildings. He created a modest mausoleum for his first wife, [[Bibi Ka Maqbara]], sometimes called the mini-Taj, in Aurangabad.  He also built in [[Lahore]] what was at the time the largest mosque outside [[Mecca]]: the [[Badshahi Masjid]] ('Imperial' Mosque, sometimes called the 'Alamgiri' Mosque).  He also added a small marble mosque known as the ''[[Moti Masjid]]'' (Pearl Mosque) to the [[Delhi Fort|Red Fort]] complex in Delhi.

Aurangzeb's personal piety is undeniable. He led an extremely simple and pious life. He followed Muslim precepts with his typical determination, and even memorized the [[Qur'an]]. He knitted [[haj]] caps and copied out the [[Qur'an]] throughout his life, and sold these works anonymously. He used the proceeds, and only these, to fund his modest resting place. 

He ruled india with an iron fist, and during his rule none of his decendents dared conspire overthrowing him. He died in [[Ahmednagar]] in [[1707]] at the age of 90, having outlived many of his children. In conformance with his view of Islamic principles, his body rests in an open-air grave in [[Kuldabad]], near [[Aurangabad]]. 

After Aurangzeb's death, there were more than 100 claimants to throne due to his extended rule, and power struggle and infighting, which were characteristics of Mughal dynasty, followed. Eventually, his son [[Bahadur Shah I]] took the throne, but this infighting weakened the Mughal Empire. In addition, Auregzeb's religious intolerance had already alienated the non-Muslim majority, which found no reason to demonstrate allegiance to the Emperor. With hostile subjects, everyday conspiracies, and infighting, the Mughal Empire entered a long decline.

==Commentary by recent historians==

===Wolpert===
[[Stanley Wolpert]] writes in his ''New History of India'' ISBN 0195166779 (Oxford, 2003)
:...Yet the conquest of the Deccan, to which [Aurangzeb] devoted the last 26 years of his life, was in many ways a Pyrrhic victory, costing an estimated hundred thousand lives a year during its last decade of futile chess game warfare...The expense in gold and rupees can hardly be accurately estimated. [Aurangzeb]'s moving capital alone- a city of tents 30 miles in circumference, some 250 bazaars, with a 1/2 million camp followers, 50,000 camels and 30,000 elephants, all of whom had to be fed, stripped peninsular India of any and all of its surplus gain and wealth... Not only famine but bubonic plague arose...Even [Aurangzeb] had ceased to understand the purpose of it all by the time he..was nearing 90... &quot;I came alone and I go as a stranger. I do not know who I am, nor what I have been doing,&quot; the dying old man confessed to his son in Feb 1707. &quot;I have sinned terribly, and I do not know what punishment awaits me.&quot;

===[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/index.html Manas] Group, UCLA===
:A year after he assumed power in 1658, Aurangzeb appointed muhtasaibs, or censors of public morals, from the ranks of the ulema or clergy in every large city. He was keen that the sharia or Islamic law be followed everywhere, and that practices abhorrent to Islam, such as the consumption of alcohol and gambling, be disallowed in public...

:It can scarcely be doubted, once the historical evidence is weighed, that the religious policies of Aurangzeb were discriminatory... [L]ittle, if any, evidence has been offered to suggest how far the conversion of Hindus took place, and whether there was any official policy beyond one of mere encouragement that led to the conversion of Hindus. Then, as now, conversion would have been more attractive to the vast number of Hindus living under the tyranny of caste oppression...[T]he kind of inducements that Aurangzeb offered [were not] substantially different from the inducements that modern, purportedly secular, politicians offer...

:Hindus employed...under Aurangzeb's reign rose from 24.5% in the time of his father Shah Jahan to 33% in the fourth decade of his own rule.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''Alternate meaning: [[Alexandrine of Denmark]]''

An '''alexandrine''' is a line of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meter]]. Alexandrines are common in the [[German literature]] of the [[German literature of the Baroque period|Baroque period]] and in [[List of French language poets|French poetry]] of the early modern and modern periods and much less common in [[English poetry]], which more frequently uses [[iambic pentameter]] or 5-foot verse.

==Syllabic verse==

In [[syllabic verse]], such as that used in [[French literature]], an alexandrine is a line of twelve syllables, often with a [[caesura]] between the sixth and seventh syllables. Alternatively, an alexandrine may be divided into three four-syllable sections by two caesuras.

The dramatic works of [[Pierre Corneille]] and [[Jean Racine]] are typically composed of rhyming alexandrine couplets. (The caesura after the 6th syllable is here marked || )

:Nous partîmes cinq cents ; || mais par un prompt renfort
:Nous nous vîmes trois mille || en arrivant au port 

:(Corneille, ''Le Cid'' Act IV , scene 3) 

[[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]]'s ''Les Bijoux'' (The Jewels) is a typical example of the use of the alexandrine in 19th century French poetry :

:La très-chère était nue, || et, connaissant mon cœur,
:Elle n'avait gardé || que ses bijoux sonores,
:Dont le riche attirail || lui donnait l'air vainqueur
:Qu'ont dans leurs jours heureux || les esclaves des Mores.

Even a 20th century Surrealist, such as [[Paul Éluard]] used alexandrines on occasion, such as in these lines from ''L'Égalité des sexes'' (in ''Capitale de la douleur'') (note the variation between caesuras after the 6th syllable, and after 4th and 8th):

:Ni connu la beauté || des yeux, beauté des pierres,
:Celle des gouttes d'eau, || des perles en placard,
:Des pierres nues || et sans squelette, || ô ma statue

==Accentual verse==

In [[accentual verse]], it is a line of [[iambic]] [[hexameter]] - a line of six feet or measures (&quot;iambs&quot;), each of which has two syllables with an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable.  It is also usual for there to be a caesura between the sixth and seventh syllables (as the examples from [[Alexander Pope|Pope]] below illustrate.  [[Robert Bridges]] noted that in the lyrical sections of ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', [[John Milton|Milton]] significantly varied the placement of the caesura.

In [[quantitative meter]]s, an iamb comprises a short syllable followed by a long syllable (as in the word ''delay''), and an alexandrine consists of six such short+long feet.
 
In the poetry of [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' 8 lines of pentameter are followed by an alexandrine, the 6-foot line slowing the regular rhythm of the 5-foot lines.

Undoubtedly the most famous alexandrine in the English language is a rhyming [[couplet]] of [[Alexander Pope]]'s, in which the first line is in iambic pentameter and the second line is an alexandrine:

:A needless alexandrine ends the song
:that like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.

A few lines later Pope continues discussing fast lines:

:Not so, when swift Camilla scours the Plain,
:Flies o'er th'unbending corn and skims along the Main.

The second line of the couplet, a very fast line, is remarkably an alexandrine itself, which Pope just claimed made the line excruciatingly slow.  As [[Paul Fussell]] has said, &quot;It is the literary equivalent of shouting, 'Look! No hands.'&quot;

Alexandrines are sometimes introduced into predominantly pentameter verse for the sake of variety. The [[Spenserian stanza]], for instance, is eight lines of pentameter followed by an Alexandrine. In the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] and eighteenth century, poetry written in couplets is sometimes varied by the introduction of a triplet in which the third line is an Alexandrine, as in this example from [[John Dryden|Dryden]], which introduces a triplet after two couplets: 

:But satire needs not those, and wit will shine
:Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line:
:A noble error, and but seldom made,
:When poets are by too much force betrayed.
:Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime,
:Still showed a quickness; and maturing time
:But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of rhyme.

==Origin==

There is some doubt as to the origin of the name; but most probably it is derived from a [[Alexander Romance|collection of Alexandrine romances]], collected in the 12th century, of which [[Alexander the Great|Alexander of Macedon]] was the hero, and in which he was represented, somewhat like the British [[King Arthur|Arthur]], as the pride and crown of chivalry. Before the publication of this work most of the [[trouvère]] romances appeared in octosyllabic verse. There is also a theory that the form was invented by a [[Alexander of Paris|poet named Alexander]]. The new work, which was henceforth to set the fashion to French literature, was written in lines of twelve syllables, but with a freedom of pause which was afterwards greatly curtailed. The new fashion, however, was not adopted all at once. The metre fell into disuse until the reign of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], when it was revived by [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]], one of the seven poets known as [[La Pléiade]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''analog(ue) computer''' is a form of [[computer]] that uses electrical or mechanical phenomena to model the problem being solved by using one kind of physical quantity to represent another.  The central concept among all analog computers can be better understood by examining the definition of an [[analogy]]. The similarities of an analogy define the salient characteristics of the comparison.  But the differences in an analogy are important too.  Modeling a real physical system in a computer is called [[simulation]].

[[Image:ELWAT.jpg|thumb|300px|Polish Analog computer [[ELWAT]].]]

For example, the similarity between linear mechanical components, such as [[spring (device)|spring]]s and [[dashpot]]s, and electrical components, such as [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, and [[resistor]]s is striking in terms of mathematics, or even direct mapping (as in simulation). They can be modeled using equations that are of the same form.  Or, by direct observation (without the aid of mathematics): e.g., water pressure can be simulated by voltage (electro-motive force), and water flow (gallons per minute) can be simulated by amperes (coulombs per second).

However, the difference between these systems is what makes analog computing useful. Consider a simple mass-spring system. To construct the physical system would require buying the springs and masses, attaching them to each other and an appropriate anchor, collecting test equipment with the appropriate input range, and finally, taking (somewhat difficult) measurements.  

The electrical equivalent can be constructed with a few operational amplifiers ([[Op amp]]s) and some passive linear components; all measurements can be taken directly with an [[oscilloscope]].  In the circuit, the  (simulated) 'mass of the spring' can be changed by adjusting a [[potentiometer]].  The electrical system is an '''analogy''' to the physical system, hence the name, but it is less expensive to construct, safer, and easier to modify.  The all-electronic analog computer is also extremely fast, since a calculation is completed at the rate at which a signal traverses the circuit, which is generally an appreciable fraction of the speed of light.

The drawback of the mechanical-electrical analogy is that electronics are limited by the range over which the variables may vary.  This is called [[dynamic range]].  They are also limited by [[noise (physics)|noise levels]].

There is a lack of understanding about electrical systems that sometimes leades to the terms ''analog'' and ''digital'' having seemingly confusing and somewhat dubious meanings.  Analog systems are sometimes understood only as continuous, time variant electrical systems.  From the above discussion ''this is not correct,'' since discontinuous functions may also be modeled.  In fact, ''digital'' also has a precise technical definition.  In the context of circuits, it refers to the use of binary electrical pulse codes for symbols and ''the manipulation of these '''symbols''''' in the operation of the digital computer.  The electronic analog computer manipulates the physical quantities of (waveforms) of volts or amperes. Consequently, the precision of the analog computer readout (of rational numbers) is limited only by the [[quantization]] of the readout equipment used (generally three or four places).  The digital computer precision is limited by the (necessarily finite) number of symbols which may be used in the calculation itself.

There is an intermediate device, a [[hybrid computer]], in which a [[digital computer]] is combined with an analog computer.  Hybrid computers are used to obtain a very [[accurate]] but imprecise 'seed' value, using an analog computer front-end, which is then fed into a digital computer [[iterative]] process to achieve the final desired degree of [[precision]]. With a three or four digit, highly accurate numerical seed, the total digital computation time necessary to reach the desired precision is dramatically reduced, since many fewer iterations are required. Or, for example, the analog computer might be used to solve a non-analytic differential equation problem for use at some stage of an overall computation (where precision is not very important).  In any case, the hybrid computer is usually substantially faster than a digital computer, but can supply a far more precise computation than an analog computer.  It is useful for [[real-time]] applications requiring such a combination (e.g., a high frequency [[phased-array radar]] or a weather system computation).

Some examples:
* the [[abacus]] is a hand-operated digital computer (but not [[Binary numeral system|binary]]; it is [[biquinary]])
* the [[slide rule]] is a hand-operated analog computer
* early [[gun director]]s used mechanical analog computers to direct gunnery fire

== How analog computers work ==
Computations are often performed, in analog computers, by using properties of electrical resistance, voltages and so on. For example, a simple two variable adder can be created by two [[current source]]s in parallel. The first value is set by adjusting the first current source (to say ''x'' [[milli]][[ampere]]s), and the second value is set by adjusting the second current source  (say ''y'' milliamperes). Measuring the current across the two at their junction to signal ground will give the sum as an current through a resistance to signal ground, i.e., ''x''+''y'' milliamperes. (See [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's current law]]) Other calculations are performed similarly, using [[operational amplifier]]s and specially designed circuits for other tasks. 

The use of electrical properties in analog computers means that calculations are normally performed in [[real time]] (or faster), at a significant fraction of the speed of light, without the relatively large calculation delays of digital computers. This property allows certain useful calculations that are comparatively &quot;difficult&quot; for digital computers to perform— for example numerical integration. These computers can integrate— essentially calculating the integral of a (nondiscrete) voltage waveform, usually by means of a [[capacitor]], which accumulates charge over time.

[[Nonlinear]] functions and calculations can be constructed to a limited precision (three or four digits) by designing [[function generator]]s— special circuits of various combinations of [[capacitance]], [[reactance]], [[electrical resistance|resistance]], and variable current (e.g., [[Zener diode|Zener]]) diodes. Generally, a nonlinear function is simulated by a nonlinear waveform whose shape varies with voltage (or current).  For example, as voltage increases, the total [[impedance]] may change as the diodes successively permit current to flow.

Any physical process which models some computation can be interpreted as an analog computer. Some examples, invented for the purpose of illustrating the concept of analog computation, include using a bundle of [[spaghetti]] as a model of ''sorting numbers''; a board, a set of nails, and a rubber band as a model of finding the ''[[convex hull]] of a set of points;'' and strings tied together as a model of ''finding the shortest path in a network.'' These are all described ''in'' A.K. Dewdney (see [[#Reference|citation]] below).

== Analog computer components ==
Analog computers often have a complicated framework, but they have, at their core, a set of key electrical components which perform the calculations, which the operator manipulates through the computer's framework:

* [[potentiometer]]s
* [[operational amplifier]]s
* [[integrator]]s
* fixed-[[function generator]]s

The core mathematical operations used in an electric analog computer are:

* [[summation]]
* [[additive inverse|inversion]]
* [[exponentiation]]
* [[logarithm]]
* [[integration]] with respect to time
* [[differentiation]] with respect to time
* [[multiplication]] and [[division]]

Differentiation with respect to time is not frequently used. It corresponds in the frequency domain to a high-pass filter, which means that high-frequency noise is amplified.

== Limitations ==
In general, analog computers are limited by real, non-ideal effects.  An analog signal is composed of four basic components: DC and AC magnitudes, frequency, and phase.  The real limits of range on these characteristics limit analog computers.  Some of these limits include the [[noise floor]], [[non-linearity|non-linearities]] and [[Microelectronics|parasitic effects]] within semiconductor devices, and the finite charge of an [[electron]].  Incidentally, for commercially available electronic components, ranges of these aspects of input and output signals are always figures of merit.

Analog computers, however, have been replaced by digital computers for almost all uses. It may be stretching a point to regard some physical simulations such as [[wind tunnel]]s as analog computers, because the data so obtained must then also be scaled, for example, for [[Reynolds number]] and [[Mach number]]. There is a point of view in physics based on [[information processing]] which attempts to map the physical [[process]]es to [[computation]]s. Thus, from these points of view, the wind tunnel data gathering is either an [[experiment]] or a [[computation]].

== Current Research ==
While digital computation is extremely popular, research in analog computation is being done by a handful of people worldwide. In the United States, [[Jonathan Mills]] has been working on research using Extended Analog Computers. At the [[Harvard Robotics Laboratory]], analog computation is a research topic.

== Practical analog computers ==
These are examples of analog computers that have been constructed or practically used:
* [[nomogram]]
* [[The MONIAC Computer|Moniac computer]]
* [[astrolabe]]
* [[operational amplifier]]
* [[planimeter]]
* [[mechanical integrator]]
* [[Torquetum]]
* [[Tide predictor]]s
* [[Water integrator]]
* [[Target Data Computer]]
* [[Norden bombsight]]
* [[Hydraulic model of UK economy]]
* the [[Antikythera mechanism]]
* and the [[slide rule]]

[[Analog synthesizer]]s can also be viewed as a form of analog computer, and their technology was originally based on electronic analog computer technology.

== Idealized analog computers ==
Computer theorists often refer to idealized analog computers as [[real computer]]s (so called because they operate on the set of [[real number]]s). Digital computers, by contrast, must first [[quantize]] the signal into a finite number of values, and so can only work with the [[rational number]] set (or, with an approximation of irrational numbers).

These idealized analog computers may ''in theory'' solve problems that are [[intractable]] on digital computers; however as mentioned, in reality, analog computers are far from attaining this ideal, largely because of noise minimization problems.  Moreover, given ''unlimited'' time and memory, the (ideal) digital computer may also solve real number problems.
