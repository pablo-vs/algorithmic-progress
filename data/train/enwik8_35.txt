      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[calculus]], an '''antiderivative''' or  '''primitive function''' of a given [[real number|real valued]] [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''  is a function ''F''  whose [[derivative]] is equal to ''f'', i.e., ''F''&amp;prime; = ''f''. The process of solving for antiderivatives is '''antidifferentiation''' (or '''indefinite integration'''). Finding an expression for an antiderivative is harder than calculating a derivative, and may not always be possible.  Antiderivatives are related to [[integral]]s through the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], and provide a convenient means for calculating the integrals of many functions.

==Example==
The function ''F''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3 is an antiderivative of ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. As the derivative of a [[constant]] is [[0 (number)|zero]], ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; will have an [[infinity|infinite]] number of antiderivatives; such as (''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3) + 0, (''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / 3) + 7,  (''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / 3) &amp;minus; 36, etc. Thus, the antiderivative [[family (mathematics)|family]] of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is collectively referred to by ''F''(''x'') = (''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / 3) + ''C''; where ''C'' is any constant. Essentially, the [[graph of a function|graphs]] of  antiderivatives of a given function are [[vertical translation]]s of each other; each graph's location depending upon the [[Value (mathematics)|value]] of ''C''.

==Uses and properties==
Antiderivatives are important because they can be used to compute [[integral#integral calculus|integrals]], using the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]: if ''F'' is an antiderivative of the integrable function ''f'', then:

:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_a^b f(x)\, dx = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

Because of this, the [[set]] of all antiderivatives of a given function ''f'' is sometimes called the '''general integral''' or '''indefinite integral''' of ''f'' and is written using the integral symbol with no bounds:
:&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;
It is critical to remember that an integral is not the same, in general, as the means for evaluating it; and the function that an integral implies stands apart from that means - in the case of single-variable integrals, from antiderivatives.

If ''F'' is an antiderivative of ''f'', and the function ''f'' is defined on some [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], then every other antiderivative ''G'' of ''f'' differs from ''F'' by a constant: there exists a number ''C'' such that ''G''(''x'') = ''F''(''x'') + ''C'' for all ''x''.  ''C'' is called the [[arbitrary constant of integration]]. If the domain of ''F'' is a [[disjoint union]] of two or more intervals, then a different constant of integration may be chosen for each of the intervals. For instance

:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=\begin{cases}-\frac{1}{x}+C_1\quad x&lt;0\\-\frac{1}{x}+C_2\quad x&gt;0\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

is the most general antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=1/x^2&lt;/math&gt; on its natural domain &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty).&lt;/math&gt;

Every [[continuous function]] ''f'' has an antiderivative, and one antiderivative ''F'' is given by the integral of ''f'' with variable upper boundary:
:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int\limits_a^x f(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;
Varying the lower boundary produces other antiderivatives (but not necessarily all possible antiderivatives).  This is another formulation of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. 

There are many functions whose antiderivatives, even though they exist, cannot be expressed in terms of [[elementary function]]s (like [[polynomial]]s, [[exponential function]]s, [[logarithm]]s, [[trigonometric function]]s, [[inverse trigonometric function]]s and their combinations).  Examples of these are 
:&lt;math&gt;\int e^{-x^2}\,dx,\qquad \int \frac{\sin(x)}{x}\,dx,\qquad \int\frac{1}{\ln x}\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[differential Galois theory]] for a more detailed discussion.

== Techniques of integration ==

Finding antiderivatives is considerably harder than finding derivatives. We have various methods at our disposal:  

* the [[linearity of integration]] allows us to break complicated integrals into simpler ones
* [[integration by substitution]], often combined with [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]] or the [[natural logarithm]]
* [[integration by parts]] to integrate products of functions
* the [[inverse chain rule method]], a special case of integration by substitution
* the method of [[partial fractions in integration]] allows us to integrate all [[rational function]]s (fractions of two polynomials)
* the [[Risch algorithm]]
* integrals can also be looked up in a [[table of integrals]]
* when integrating multiple times, we can use certain additional techniques, see for instance [[double integral]]s and [[coordinates (mathematics)#Polar coordinates|polar coordinates]], the [[Jacobian]] and the [[Stokes theorem]]
* [[computer algebra system]]s can be used to automate some or all of the work involved in the symbolic techniques above, which is particularly useful when the algebraic manipulations involved are very complex or lengthy
* if a function has no elementary antiderivative (for instance, exp(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)), its integral can be approximated using [[numerical integration]]

== Antiderivatives of non-continuous functions ==

To illustrate some of the subtleties of the [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|fundamental theorem of calculus]], it is instructive to consider what kinds of non-continuous functions might have antiderivatives. While there are still open questions in this area, it is known that:

* Some highly pathological functions with large sets of discontinuities may nevertheless have antiderivatives.&lt;/li&gt;
* In some cases, the antiderivatives of such pathological functions may be found by [[Riemann integral|Riemann integration]], while in other cases these functions are not Riemann integrable.

We first state some general facts and then provide some illustrative examples. Throughout, we assume that the domains of our functions are open intervals.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a function ''f'' to have an antiderivative is that ''f'' have the [[intermediate value theorem|intermediate value property]]. That is, if [''a'',''b''] is a subinterval of the domain of ''f'' and ''d'' is any real number between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b''), then ''f''(''c'')=''d'' for some ''c'' between ''a'' and ''b''. To see this, let ''F'' be an antiderivative of ''f'' and consider the continuous function ''g''(''x'')=''F''(''x'')-''dx'' on the closed interval [''a'', ''b'']. Then ''g'' must have either a maximum or minimum ''c'' in the open interval (''a'',''b'') and so 0=''g''&amp;prime;(''c'')=''f''(''c'')-''d''.&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The set of discontinuities of ''f'' must be a [[Baire space#Historical definition|meagre set]]. This set must also be an [[F-sigma]] set (since the set of discontinuities of any function must be of this type).  Moreover for any meagre F-sigma set, one can construct some function ''f'' having an antiderivative, which has the given set as its set of discontinuities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If ''f'' has an antiderivative, is [[boundedness|bounded]] on closed finite subintervals of the domain and has a set of discontinuities of [[Lebesgue measure]] 0, then an antiderivative may be found by integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If ''f'' has an antiderivative ''F'' on a closed interval [''a'',''b''], then for any choice of partition &lt;math&gt;a=x_0&lt;x_1&lt;x_2&lt;\dots&lt;x_n=b&lt;/math&gt;, if one chooses sample points &lt;math&gt;x_i^*\in[x_{i-1},x_i]&lt;/math&gt; as specified by the [[mean value theorem]], then the corresponding Riemann sum [[telescoping series|telescopes]] to the value ''F''(''b'')-''F''(''a'').
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*)(x_i-x_{i-1}) = \sum_{i=1}^n [F(x_i)-F(x_{i-1})] = F(x_n)-F(x_0) = F(b)-F(a)&lt;/math&gt;
However if the set of discontinuities of ''f'' has positive Lebesgue measure, a different choice of sample points &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; will give a significantly different value for the Riemann sum, no matter how fine the partition. See Example 4 below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Some examples ===

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The function 
:''f''(''x'') = 2''x'' sin (1/''x'') - cos(1/''x'') 
with ''f''(0) = 0 is not continuous at ''x'' = 0 but has the antiderivative ''F''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin(1/''x'') with ''F''(0) = 0. Since ''f'' is bounded on closed finite intervals and is only discontinuous at 0, the antiderivative ''F'' may be obtained by integration: &lt;math&gt;F(x)=\int_0^x f(t)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The function 

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=2x\sin\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)-\frac{2}{x}\cos\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; 

with ''f''(0) = 0 is not continuous at ''x'' = 0 but has the antiderivative 

:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; 

with ''F''(0) = 0. Unlike Example 1, ''f''(''x'') is unbounded in any interval containing 0, so the Riemann integral is undefined.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; If ''f''(''x'') is the function in Example 1 and ''F'' is its antiderivative, and &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[dense set|dense]] [[countable]] subset of the open interval (-1,1), then the function 

:&lt;math&gt;g(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{f(x-x_n)}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; 

has as antiderivative 

:&lt;math&gt;G(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{F(x-x_n)}{2^n}.&lt;/math&gt; 

The set of discontinuities of ''g'' is precisely the set &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''g'' is bounded on closed finite intervals and the set of discontinuities has measure 0, the antiderivative ''G'' may be found by integration.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[dense]] [[countable]] subset of the open interval (-1,1). Consider the everywhere continuous strictly increasing function 

:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{2^n}(x-x_n)^{1/3}.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that 

:&lt;math&gt;F'(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{3\cdot2^n}(x-x_n)^{-2/3}&lt;/math&gt;
[[image:antideriv1.gif|125px|right|thumb|Figure 1.]] 
[[image:antideriv2.gif|thumb|right|125px|Figure 2.]] 

for all values ''x'' where the series converges, and that the graph of ''F''(''x'') has vertical tangent lines at all other values of ''x''. In particular the graph has vertical tangent lines at all points in the set &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover ''F''&amp;prime;(''x'')&amp;gt;0 for all ''x'' where the derivative is defined. It follows that the inverse function &lt;math&gt;G=F^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable everywhere and that &lt;math&gt;g(x)=G'(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' in the set &lt;math&gt;\{F(x_n)\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt; which is dense in the interval [''F''(-1),''F''(1)]. Thus ''g'' has an antiderivative ''G''. On the other hand, it can not be true that 

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{F(-1)}^{F(1)}g(x)\,dx=GF(1)-GF(-1)=2,&lt;/math&gt;

since for any partition of [''F''(-1),''F''(1)], one can choose sample points for the Riemann sum from the set &lt;math&gt;\{F(x_n)\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt;, giving a value of 0 for the sum. It follows that ''g'' has a set of discontinuities of positive Lebesgue measure. Figure 1 on the right shows an approximation to the graph of ''g''(''x'') where &lt;math&gt;\{x_n=\cos(n)\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt; and the series is truncated to 8 terms. Figure 2 shows the graph of an approximation to the antiderivative ''G''(''x''), also truncated to 8 terms. On the other hand if the Riemann integral is replaced by the [[Lebesgue integral]], then [[Fatou's lemma]] or the [[dominated convergence theorem]] shows that ''g'' does satisfy the fundamental theorem of calculus in that context.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In Examples 3 and 4, the sets of discontinuities of the functions ''g'' are dense only in a finite open interval (''a'',''b''). However these examples can be easily modified so as to have  sets of discontinuities which are dense on the entire real line &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. Let
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(x) = \frac{a+b}{2} + \frac{b-a}{\pi}\tan^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;g\left(\lambda(x)\right)\lambda'(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a dense set of discontinuities on  &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and has antiderivative &lt;math&gt;G\cdot\lambda.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Using a similar method as in Example 5, one can modify ''g'' in Example 4 so as to vanish at all [[rational numbers]]. If one uses a naive version of the [[Riemann integral]] defined as the limit of left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums over regular partitions, one will obtain that the integral of such a function ''g'' over an interval [''a'',''b''] is 0 whenever ''a'' and ''b'' are both rational, instead of ''G''(''b'')-''G''(''a'').  Thus the fundamental theorem of calculus will fail spectacularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The '''alphabet song''' is a popular tool used to help teach children the [[Latin alphabet]], commonly known by children as &quot;the A-B-C's.&quot; It is used in [[kindergarten]]s, [[pre-school]]s and homes around the world. It is sung to the widely-known French folk tune &quot;Ah! Vous Dirais-je, Maman&quot;, perhaps best-known as the melody of &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot;, and also well-known as a set of Mozart piano variations on a theme.

The song was first copyrighted by Charles Bradlee, music publisher, in Boston, USA in 1835, with the title, &quot;The A.B.C., a German air with variations for the flute with an easy accompaniment for the piano forte&quot;. The musical arrangement was attributed to Louis Le Maire (sometimes Lemaire), an 18th century composer. This was &quot;Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1835, by C. Bradlee, in the clerk's office of the District Court of Massachusetts&quot;, according to the Newberry Library catalog, which also says, &quot;The theme is that used by Mozart for his piano variations, Ah, vous dirai-je, maman.&quot; 

The alphabet song is sometimes said to come from another of Bradlee's publications, &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot;, but the first line of that song is given as &quot;Come, come my children, I must see&quot;, in Yale University's library catalog.  It is described as &quot;a favorite glee for three voices, as sung at the Salem glee club.&quot;


Lyrics: ''(each line represents a measure, or four beats)''
:''a-b-c-d-e-f-g''
:''h-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p'' (l-m-n-o spoken twice as quickly as rest of rhyme)
:''q-r-s, t-u-v'' (the comma denotes a short pause)
:''w-x, y and z'' (pronounced &quot;zed&quot; in most English-speaking countries, but &quot;zee&quot; in the U.S. and sometimes elsewhere)
:''Now I've sung my A, B, C's''
:''Tell me what you think of me.''

A variant changes the last two lines to:
:''Now I know my A, B, C's''
:''Won't you come and play with me.''
...or...
:''Next time won't you sing with me.''

Variants of the song are used in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (and former Commonwealth regions where English is in significant use, such as [[Hong Kong]]), which pronounce the letter [[Z]] as &quot;''zed''&quot;.  One variation shortens the second line and lengthens the last, to form a near-rhyme between [[N]] and [[Z]] (zed):

:''a-b-c-d-e-f-g''
:''h-i-j-k-l-m-n''
:''o-p-q, r-s-t''
:''u-v-w, x-y-z''

Other variants make significantly more changes in order to rhyme with &quot;zed&quot;, and even alter the rest of the song to fit a new rhythm. For example:
:''a-b-c-d-e-f-g''
:''h-i-j-k-lmnop''
:''lmnop-q-r-s-t''
:''u-v-w-x-y-z''
:''x-y-z.''
:''Butter on your bread''
:''If you don't like it you'll have to go to bed.''


The song can be heard [http://evaeaston.com/pr/alphabet.html here], by selecting the &quot;The Alphabet Song&quot; link directly under the chart.



The alphabet song's popularity inspired [[comedian]] [[Steven Wright]] to quip, &quot;Why is the [[Latin alphabet|alphabet]] in that order?  Is it because of ''that song?''&quot;

There is a common misconception among young children, due to the way &quot;l-m-n-o-p&quot; is sung faster than the rest of the letters, that there is a single letter called &quot;elemenopee&quot;.

A joke variation sung by children to each other is to sing the whole song except the &quot;P&quot;. 
The listener then asks &quot;Where's the P?&quot;  To this the child in jest responds &quot;Running down your knee&quot; (interpreting the &quot;P&quot; as &quot;[[Pee]]&quot;).

----
There is a version of the alphabet song using a different melody taught by some pre-schools that use the [[phonics]] method.

:''What does the A say?  Ay Aa Ah'' (the vowels are sounded completely)
:''What does the B say?  B* B* B*'' (only the leading sound of consonants are sung in the response part)
:''What does the C say?  K* K* K*'' 
:''What does the D say?  D* D* D*''
:''What does the E say?  Ee and Eh''
:. . . 
(continue for each letter with several slightly different melodies) 
:. . .
:''What does the X say?  Ks Ks Ks''
:''What does the Y say?  Y* Y* Y*''
:''What does the Z say?  Zzz Zzz Zzz''

:''What do you call these phones and sounds?''
:''English alphabet letters.''
:''Yeah!''

This song teaches children that each letter has a name and sounds. Just like a [[dog]] says &quot;woof&quot; and a [[cat]] says &quot;meow&quot;, the &quot;I&quot; says &quot;eye&quot; and &quot;ee&quot;.

----
Another variant popular at many children's summer camps goes:

:''A: you're an alphabet''
:''B: you're a belly button''
:''C: you're a cantaloupe with arms''
:''D: you're delirious''
:''E: you're an elephant''
:''F: you're the fairy of my arms''
:''G: you're a goony goon''
:''H: you're a hairy loon''
:''I: you're an icky dicky doo''
:''J: you've got joppy knees''
:''k: klaustrophobia (sp)''
:''l: you've got leprosy too!''
:''M, N: you're a maniac''
:''O: you're an octopus-pus-pus-pus''
:''P:, Q: particularly queer''
:''R, S, T,: responsible for stupid things''
:''U: pick your nose in bed''
:''V: you're a vomit head''
:''W, X, Y, Z''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Antigonid dynasty''' was a dynasty of [[Macedon|Macedonian]] kings descended from [[Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's]] general [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]] (&quot;the One-eyed&quot;). Antigonus himself ruled mostly over Asia Minor and northern Syria.  His attempts to take control of the whole of Alexander's empire led to his defeat and death at the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in [[301 BC]]. Antigonus's son [[Demetrius I Poliorcetes]] survived the battle, and managed to seize control of Macedon itself a few years later, but eventually lost his throne, dying in prison. After a period of confusion, Demetrius's son [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] was able to establish the family's control over the old Kingdom of Macedon, as well as over most of the Greek city-states, by [[276 BC]].

It was one of three such empires, the others being the [[Seleucid dynasty]] and [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. The dynasty ended with the [[Roman empire|Roman]] domination of the area after the [[Battle of Pydna]] in [[168 BC]]. 

The members of the Antingonid dynasty were:
*[[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]]
*[[Demetrius I Poliorcetes]] ([[294 BC]]-[[287 BC]])
*[[Antigonus II Gonatas]] ([[276 BC]]-[[239 BC]])
*[[Demetrius II of Macedon|Demetrius II]] (239 BC-[[229 BC]])
*[[Antigonus III Doson]] (229 BC - [[221 BC]])
*[[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] (221 BC-[[179 BC]])
*[[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] (179 BC-[[168 BC]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Abipones''' were a tribe of [[South America]]n Indians of Guaycuran stock recently inhabiting the territory lying between Santa Fe and St. Iago.  They originally occupied the Chaco district of [[Paraguay]], but were driven south by the hostility of the Spaniards and other native tribes.  According to [[Martin Dobrizhoffer]], a Jesuit missionary, who, towards the end of the [[18th century]], lived among them for a period of seven years, they then numbered not more than 5,000.  They were a well-formed, handsome people, with black eyes and aquiline noses, thick black hair, but no beards.  The hair from the forehead to the crown of the head was pulled out, this constituting a tribal mark.  The faces, breasts and arms of the women were covered with black figures of various designs made with thorns, the tattooing paint being a mixture of ashes and blood.  The lips and ears of both sexes were pierced.  The men were brave fighters, their chief weapons being the bow and spear.  No child was without bow and arrows; the bow-strings were made of foxes' entrails.  In battle the Abipones wore an armour of tapir's hide over which a jaguar's skin was sewn.  They were excellent swimmers and good horsemen.  For five months in the year when the floods were out they lived on islands or even in shelters built in the trees.  They seldom married before the age of thirty, and were singularly chaste.  

&quot;With the Abipones,&quot; wrote [[Charles Darwin]] in ''The Descent of Man'', &quot;when a man chooses a wife, he bargains with the parents about the price.  But it frequently happens that the girl rescinds what has been agreed upon between the parents and bridegroom, obstinately rejecting the very mention of marriage.  She often runs away and hides herself, and thus eludes the bridegroom.&quot;  [[Infanticide]] was systematic, never more than two children being reared in one family, a custom doubtless originating in the difficulty of subsistence.  The young were suckled for two years.  The Abipones are now believed to be extinct as a tribe. 

Martin Dobrizhoffer's [[Latin]] ''Historia de Abiponibus'' ([[Vienna]], [[1784]]) was translated into [[English language|English]] by [[Sara Coleridge]], at the suggestion of [[Robert Southey]], in [[1822]], under the title of ''An Account of the Abipones'' (3 vols.).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abjuration''' is the solemn repudiation, abandonment, or renunciation by or upon [[oath]], often the renunciation of [[citizenship]] or some other [[right]] or [[privilege]]. It comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''abjurare'', &quot;to forswear&quot;).

'''Abjuration of the realm''' was a type of abjuration in ancient [[English law]] that was a renunciation of citizenship, a type of self-imposed exile. The person taking the oath swore never to return to the kingdom unless by permission. This was often taken by fugitives who had taken [[sanctuary]]: 
:''I swear on the Holy Book that I will leave the realm of England and never return without the express permission of my Lord the King or his heirs. I will hasten by the direct road to the port allotted to me and not leave the King's highway under pain of arrest or execution. I will not stay at one place more than one night and will seek diligently for a passage across the sea as soon as I arrive, delaying only one tide if possible. If I cannot secure such passage, I will walk into the sea up to my knees every day as a token of my desire to cross. And if I fail in all this, then peril shall be my lot.''

In [[England]], an oath of abjuration was taken by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|members of Parliament]], clergy, and laymen, pledging to support the current [[British monarchy|British monach]] and repudiated the right of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] and other [[pretender]]s to the throne. This oath was imposed under [[William III of England|William III]], [[George I of the United Kingdom|George I]] and [[George I of the United Kingdom|George III]]. It was superseded by the [[oath of allegiance]].

Another famous oath of abjuration was [[Oath of Abjuration|Plakkaat van Verlatinghe]] of July 26, 1581, the formal [[declaration of independence]] of the northern [[Low Countries]] from the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish king]], [[Philip II|Philip II]]. This oath was the climax of the [[Eighty Years' War]] (Dutch Revolt).

'''Abkhazia''' ([[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] Аҧсны/Aphsny, [[Georgian language|Georgian]] აფხაზეთი/Apxazeti, [[Russian language|Russian]] Абха́зия/Abhazia) is a region of 8,600 [[square kilometre|km²]] (3,300 sq.mi.) in the [[Caucasus]]. It is formally an autonomous republic within [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] but is ''[[de facto]]'' independent, although not recognised as such internationally. The capital is [[Sukhum]].

==Geography and Climate==
Abkhazia covers an area of about 8,600 km² at the western end of Georgia, on the north shore of the [[Black Sea]]. The [[Caucasus mountains]] to the north and the northeast divide Abkhazia from [[Circassia]]. To the east, the region is bordered by [[Svanetia]]. To the southeast, Abkhazia is bounded by [[Samegrelo]]; and on the south and southwest by the Black Sea.

The republic is extremely mountainous (nearly 75% is classified as mountains or foothills) and settlement is largely confined to the coast and a number of deep, well-watered valleys.  The [[Caucasus Mountains|Greater Caucasus Mountain Range]] runs along the region's northern border.  The Gagra, Bziphi, and Kodori Ranges branch off from the Main Caucasus Range.  The highest peaks of Abkhazia are in the northeast and east (along the border with [[Svanetia]]) and several exceed 4,000 meters (13,120 feet) above sea level. The climate is extremely mild, which in the Soviet times caused it to become a popular holiday destination known as the &quot;Georgian Riviera&quot;. It is also renowned for its agricultural produce, including [[tea]], [[tobacco]], [[wine]] and [[fruit]]s.

==Landscape==
Abkhazia is well known for its beauty and contrasting landscapes.  The landscapes of the region range from coastal forests ([[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[pine]] forests near Bichvinta/Pitsunda) and citrus plantations, to eternal snows and [[glaciers]] to the north of the republic.  Because of Abkhazia's complex topographic setting, most of the territory has been spared from significant human cultivation and development.  Therefore, a large portion of Abkhazia (nearly 70% of the territory) is still covered by forests today.  Abkhazia is also well known for the high number of endemic species of plants that are found only in the Caucasus, only in Georgia, or only in Abkhazia. 

Southeastern Abkhazia, a part of the [[Colchis|Colchis Lowland]], is covered by Colchian forests ([[alder]], [[hornbeam]], [[oak]], [[Oriental Beech|beech]]), or by [[citrus]] and [[tea]] plantations.  The foothills, up to an elevation of 600 meters (1,968 feet) above sea level, are covered by [[deciduous]] forests (with [[evergreen]] elements), and include tree species such as oak, hornbeam, beech, and [[buxus]].  The forest cover from 600 to 1,800 meters (1,960-5,904 ft.) above sea level is made up of both deciduous and [[coniferous]] species of trees.  The most common species are beech, [[Caucasian Spruce|spruce]], and [[Nordmann Fir|fir]].  The mixed forest zone is home to some of the tallest trees in [[Europe]] and the world, where some specimens of the Nordmann Fir (especially around [[Lake Ritsa]]) reach heights of over 70 meters (230 feet).  The zone extending 1,800-2,900 m (5,904-9,512 ft.) above sea level is made up of either subalpine forests or [[alpine]] meadows.  Territory lying above 2,900 m (9,512 ft.) is mainly covered by eternal snows and glaciers.

==Climate==
Because of Abkhazia's proximity to the [[Black Sea]], its climate is very mild, considering the northern [[latitude]].  The Caucasus Mountains are greatly responsible for moderating the region's climate, as they shield Abkhazia from cold northerly winds. 

The coastal areas of the Republic have a subtropical climate, where the average annual temperature in most regions is around 15 degrees [[Celsius]].  Average winter (January) temperatures vary between 4 and 6 degrees C, while average summer (July) temperatures are anywhere between 22 and 23 degrees C. The coastal territory rarely experiences strong frosts during the winter.  

Higher elevations of Abkhazia, above 1,000 meters (3,280 ft.) above sea level have a maritime, mountain climate, experiencing relatively cold winters and long, warm summers.  Elevations above 2,000 m (6,560 ft.) above sea level have colder winters and shorter summers.  Abkhazia's highest regions have a cold, summerless climate throughout the year.

Abkhazia receives high amounts of precipitation, but is known for its unique micro-climate (transitional from subtropical to mountain) along most of its coast, causing lower levels of humidity.  The annual precipitation along the coast ranges from 1,100 to 1,500 mm (43-59 inches).  The foothills, the lower ranges, and the interior gorges of the Republic receive anywhere between 1,000 and 1,800 mm (39-71 in.) of precipitation annually.  Some of the interior gorges that are sheltered from the moist influences of the Black Sea receive the lowest amounts of precipitation.  The higher mountainous regions receive 1,700-3,500 mm (67-138 in.) of precipitation per year.  Although there is usually no significant snowfall in the coastal regions, the mountains of Abkhazia do receive significant amounts of snow.  [[Avalanches]] in the northeast sometimes pose a threat to populated areas.  Snow depths often exceed 5 meters (18 feet) in some of the high, mountainous areas facing the Black Sea.

==Demographics==
The demography of Abkhazia has undergone major changes since the [[1990s]]. At the time of the last Soviet census in 1989, it had a population of about 500,000, of whom 48% were [[Georgian people|Georgians]] (principally [[Mingrel]]s) and only 17% of whom were [[Abkhazians]].

In 1993, a major war led to Abkhazia breaking away from Georgia, during which virtually the entire Georgian population - about 250,000 people - were displaced in what was alleged to be a campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]]. The conflict has not yet been resolved, and Abkhazia's much-reduced population is now largely ethnically Abkhazian.

After the expulsion of the ethnic Georgians, the Abkhazians became an ethnic plurality in Abkhazia (about 45%), with Russians, Armenians, Georgians, Greeks, and Jews comprising most of the remainder of the population of Abkhazia.

==History==
===Early history===

In the [[1st millennium BC]] ([[9th century BC|9th]]-[[6th century BC|6th centuries BC]]), the territory of modern Abkhazia was a part of the ancient kingdom of [[Colchis]] (''Kolkha''), which was absorbed in [[63 BC]] into the Kingdom of [[Egrisi]]. Greek traders established ports along the Black Sea shoreline. One of those ports, Dioscurias, eventually developed into modern [[Sukhum]], Abkhazia's traditional capital.

The [[Roman Empire]] conquered Egrisi in the [[1st century]] AD and ruled it until the [[4th century]], following which it regained a measure of independence, but remained within the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s sphere of influence. The Abkhazians were converted to [[Christianity]] during the rule of the Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] in the mid-[[6th century]]. Abkhazia was made an autonomous principality of the Byzantine Empire in the [[7th century]] &amp;mdash; a status it retained until the [[9th century]], when it was united with the Georgian kingdom of [[Imereti]]. Actual independence from Constantinople ebbed and flowed during this period, which Abkhazians consider as a time of [[Abkhazian Kingdom]]. It is certain that Byzantine authority would have faded farther away from the towns, as one penetrated the mountains.

In the [[16th century]], the area was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]], during which the Abkhazians were partially converted to [[Islam]]. The Ottomans were pushed out by the Georgians, who established an autonomous Principality of Abkhazia (''Abkhazetis Samtavro'' in Georgian), ruled by the Sharvashidze dynasty.

===Abkhazia within the Russian Empire and Soviet Union===
The expansion of the [[Russian Empire]] into the Caucasus region led to small-scale but regular conflicts between Russian colonists and the indigenous Caucasian tribes. Various Georgian principalities were annexed to the empire between 1801 and 1864. The Russians acquired possession of Abhkazia in a piecemeal fashion between 1829 and 1842, but their power was not firmly established before 1864, when they managed to abolish the local Principality. Large numbers of Muslim Abkhazians &amp;mdash; said to have constituted as much as 60% of the Abkhazian population, although contemporary census reports were not very trustworthy &amp;mdash; emigrated to the Ottoman Empire between 1864 and 1878.

Modern Abkhazian historians insist that large areas of the region were left uninhabited, and that many [[Armenia]]ns, Georgians and Russians (all Christians) subsequently migrated to Abkhazia, resettling much of the vacated territory. This version of events is strongly contested by Georgian historians (see Lortkipanidze M., ''The Abkhazians and Abkhazia'', Tbilisi 1990) who argue that Georgian tribes ([[Samegrelo|Mingrelians]] and [[Svans]]) had populated Abkhazia from ancient times, since the [[Colchis]] kingdom. According to Georgian scholars, modern Abkhazians are the descendants of the North Caucasian tribes ([[Adygey]], [[Apsua]]), and are the ones who were moving down to Abkhazia from the North Caucasus mountains throughout history and merging there with the existing Georgian population. Either way, by the beginning of the 20th century, Abkhazians were a minority in the region. The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' reported in 1911 that in the principal town, Sukhum-kaleh (modern Sukhum; population then 43,000), two-thirds were Mingrelian Georgians, and one-third Abkhazians. [[Image:Ritsa.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lake Ritsa]] to the north from [[Pitsunda]].]]

The takeover of the [[Bolsheviks]] following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] in 1917 led to Abkhazia being granted a degree of cultural and political autonomy, until in 1931 [[Stalin]] made it an autonomous republic within [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Georgia. Despite its nominal autonomy, it was subjected to strong central rule from Tbilisi, and the policy of &quot;Georgianization&quot; was forcibly imposed. Georgian became the official language, the Abkhaz language was banned, and cultural rights were repressed, with thousands of Abkhazians killed during Stalin's purges. [[Lavrenty Beria]] encouraged Georgian migration to Abkhazia, and many took up the offer and resettled there. Later, in the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]], [[Vazgen I]] and the Armenian church encouraged and funded the migration of Armenians to Abkhazia. Currently, Armenians are the largest minority group in Abkhazia.

The repression of Abkhazians was ended after Stalin's death and Beria's execution, and Abkhazians were given a much more powerful role in the governance of the autonomous republic. As in most of the smaller autonomous republics, the Soviet government encouraged the growth of culture, and particularly of literature. Ethnic quotas were established for certain bureaucratic posts, giving the Abkhaz a degree of political power that was disproportionate to their minority status in the republic. This was interpreted by some as a &quot;divide and rule&quot; policy whereby local elites were given a share in power in exchange for support for the Soviet regime. In Abkhazia as elsewhere, it led to other ethnic groups &amp;mdash; in this case, the Georgians &amp;mdash; resenting what they saw as unfair discrimination, thereby stoking ethnic discord in the republic.

===The Abkhazian War===
As the Soviet Union began to disintegrate at the end of the [[1980s]], ethnic tension grew between the Abkhazians and Georgians over Georgia's moves towards independence.  Many Abkhazians opposed this, fearing that an independent Georgia would lead to  &quot;Georgianization&quot;, and argued instead for the establishment of Abkhazia as an independent republic in its own right. The dispute soon turned violent in Sukhum on [[16 July]] [[1989]]. Sixteen Georgians were said to have been killed and another 137 injured when they wanted to enroll in a Georgian University instead of an Abkhazian one. After several days of violence, Soviet troops restored order in the city, but blamed rival nationalist paramilitaries for &quot;provoking&quot; confrontations.

Georgia declared independence on [[9 April]] [[1991]], under the rule of the former Soviet dissident [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]]. Gamsakhurdia's rule became unpopular, and that December, the Georgian National Guard, under the command of [[Tengiz Kitovani]], laid siege to the offices of Gamsakhurdia's government in [[Tbilisi]]. After months of stalemate, he was forced to resign in January 1992. He was replaced as president by [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], the former Soviet foreign minister and architect of the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Shevardnadze inherited a government dominated by hardline Georgian nationalists, and although he was not an ethnic nationalist, he did little to avoid being seen as supporting the government figures and powerful coup leaders who were.

On [[21 February]] [[1992]], Georgia's ruling Military Council announced that it was abolishing the Soviet-era constitution and restoring the 1921 Constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]]. Many Abkhazians interpreted this as an abolition of their autonomous status. In response, on [[23 July]] 1992, the Abkhazia government effectively declared independence, although this gesture went unrecognized by any other country. The Georgian government accused Gamsakhurdia supporters of kidnapping Georgia's interior minister and holding him captive in Abkhazia. The Georgian government dispatched 3,000 troops to the region, ostensibly to restore order. Heavy fighting between Georgian forces and Abkhazian militia broke out in and around Sukhum. The Abkhazian authorities rejected the government's claims, claiming that it was merely a pretext for an invasion. After about a week's fighting and many casualties on both sides, Georgian government forces managed to take control of most of Abkhazia, and closed down the regional parliament.

The Abkhazians' military defeat was met with a hostile response by the self-styled [[Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus]], an umbrella group uniting a number of anti-Russian movements in the North Caucasus, Russia ([[Chechen]]s, [[Cossacks]], [[Ossetians]] and others). Hundreds of volunteer paramilitaries from Russia (including the then little known [[Shamil Basayev]]) joined forces with the Abkhazian separatists to fight the Georgian government forces . In September, the Abkhazians and Russian paramilitaries mounted a major offensive after breaking a cease-fire, which drove the Georgian forces out of large swathes of the republic. Shevardnadze's government accused Russia of giving covert military support to the rebels with the aim of &quot;detaching from Georgia its native territory and the Georgia-Russian frontier land&quot;. The year 1992 ended with the rebels in control of much of Abkhazia west of Sukhum. Significant &quot;[[ethnic cleansing]]&quot; occurred on both sides, with Abkhazians displaced from Georgian-held territory and vice-versa; some 3,000 people were reported to have been killed in this first phase of the war.

The conflict remained stalemated until July 1993, when Abkhazian (separatist) militia launched an attack on Georgian-held Sukhum. The capital was surrounded and heavily shelled, with Shevardnadze himself trapped in the city. Although a truce was declared at the end of July, this collapsed after a renewed Abkhaz attack in mid-September. After ten days of heavy fighting, Sukhum fell on [[27 September]], 1993. Newly appointed Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze narrowly escaped death, having vowed to stay in the city no matter what, but he was eventually forced to flee when separatist snipers fired on the hotel where he was residing. Shevardnadze had to rely on the Russian navy to evacuate him from Sukhum.

The separatist forces quickly overran the rest of Abkhazia as the Georgian government faced a second threat: an uprising by the supporters of the deposed Zviad Gamsakhurdia in the region of Mingrelia (Samegrelo).  In the chaotic aftermath of defeat, almost the entire non-Abkhazian population fled the region by sea or over the mountains. Many thousands died &amp;mdash; it is thought that as many as 10,000 may have perished &amp;mdash; and some 250,000-300,000 people were forced into exile.

==Abkhazia today==
The Abkhaz conflict has not been resolved; a ceasefire agreement was signed on [[15 May]] [[1994]] and a [[United Nations]] peacekeeping force ([[UNOMIG]]) was given the task of monitoring the agreement. A separate force from the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) was assigned to a peacekeeping mission.

Peace talks have taken place on and off over the last ten years but have achieved little of significance. Although there have been no major outbreaks of fighting in the meantime, border clashes and armed raids by both sides continue to inflict casualties.

A new constitution was adopted on [[4 November]] [[1994]] which declared Abkhaz sovereignty. Elections were held on [[23 November]] [[1996]] but these were not recognised by the Georgian government or the international community, as the elections were held after [[ethnic cleansing]] when majority of pre-war population had fled Abkhazia. The CIS imposed economic sanctions in January 1996 and the region is formally blockaded by both Georgia and Russia.

On [[3 October]] [[2004]] presidential elections were held in Abkhazia. In the elections, Russia evidently supported then-Prime Minister [[Raul Khadjimba]], also backed by seriously ailing outgoing separatist President [[Vladislav Ardzinba]]. Posters of Russia's President [[Vladimir Putin]] together with Khadjimba, who like Putin had worked as a [[KGB]] official, were everywhere in Sukhum. Deputies of Russia's parliament and Russian singers, led by [[Joseph Kobzon]], both a deputy and a popular songster, came to Abkhazia compaigning for Khadjimba.

Still, on [[12 October]] Abkhazia's Supreme Court, after a series of contradictory decisions by the Electoral Committee, recognized that the new president would be businessman [[Sergei Bagapsh]], accused by his rival's supporters of being pro-Georgian. Abkhazia's outgoing President Ardzinba claimed the decision was illegal and made under pressure from supporters of Bagapsh. The decision was cancelled by the Supreme Court that night. When supporters of [[Raul Khadjimba]] seized the building of the Supreme Court and destroyed the protocols from local electoral constituencies, new elections were prescribed.

Soon the Supreme Court cancelled the later decision, and again named Bagapsh the new president. His supporters captured a local TV station, while Khadjimba's supporters took control over the parliament's building. Outgoing President Ardzinba replaced Khadjimba as prime minister with [[Nodar Khashba]], who before this appointment served in the [[Ministry of Extraordinary Situations (Russian Federation)|Ministry of Extraordinary Situations]] of Russia.

On [[12 November]] supporters of Bagapsh, who was planning to be inaugurated on [[7 December]], took the building of Abkhazia's administration, making [[Nodar Khashba]] flee from his room. Capturing the major governmental offices in Sukhum led to the death of one elderly woman, [[Tamara Shakryl]]. (Bagapsh's supporters claim she was killed by Ardzinba's guard.)  The same day Russia made it clear that it would directly intervene in Abkhazian developments in case of threats to its interests in this unrecognized republic, and blamed Bagapsh for the disorders.

In response, Georgia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it &quot;calls upon the Group of Friends of the UN Secretary General and the international community to give the proper reaction to such Russian declarations, to reiterate their support to Georgia's full sovereignty and territorial integrity and to warn Russia to abstain from any interference in Georgia's internal affairs.&quot;

In response to Georgia's accusations that Russia was sending its so-called peacemaking troops to Sukhum, Russian lieutenant colonel Yevgeni Morenko, head of the Collective Peacemaking Forces in the region, told journalists on [[12 November]] that only two armored troop-carriers were sent to Abkhazia's capital, &quot;for better protection of the Peacemaking Headquarters&quot;.

On [[14 November]], Prime Minister [[Nodar Khashba]], named by the relatives of Tamara Shakryl as responsible for her death and threatened by them, had to spend the night at Russia's Peacemaking Headquarters in Sukhum. Tensions continued to mount as the day for Bagapsh's inaugural ceremony came. In early December 2004, however, Bagapsh came to an agreement with Khadjimba under which they would run in new elections under a national unity ticket, with Bagapsh as presidential candidate and Khadjimba as vice-presidential candidate. The ticket won the elections with over 90% of the vote, and the new administration took office on [[12 February]] 2005.

==Abkhazia's future==
Abkhazian leaders have made alternating demands in recent years. At times, they have insisted on full independence, and at other times, they have requested associate membership in the Russian Federation. However, the Russian government has been slow to respond to the latter proposal, fearing the negative effect of such an action on its relations with Georgia. On [[28 November]] [[2003]], Russian MP [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]] tabled such a resolution in the [[State Duma]], but saw it rejected. Nonetheless, many citizens of Abkhazia now possess Russian citizenship, and Abkhazians, unlike Georgians entering Russia, do not require a visa.

The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[European Union]] and [[United Nations]] have continued to insist that Abkhazia must remain part of Georgia, and that at the very least, the many Georgian refugees who fled after the 1992-1993 war must be allowed to return, before any acceptable vote on independence can be held.

The Georgian government has continued to insist on Abkhazia's reunification with Georgia, but has differed in its suggestions of means to achieve this, particularly under the government of current President [[Mikhail Saakashvili]].

They have, at times, proposed two main peace deals. The first one would divide Georgia into seven autonomous entities, each with power over police and economic issues, but relinquishing power over defence and foreign affairs to the federal government. In a later proposal, it was suggested that Georgia and Abkhazia could form one federal Georgian republic, somewhat along the lines of [[Serbia and Montenegro]].

The Georgian government has, at times, suggested that they may attempt to resolve the conflict by military means. After the 2004 removal of [[Ajaria]]n leader [[Aslan Abashidze]] from office after large public protests, Saakashvili suggested that Abkhazia and fellow separatist entity [[South Ossetia]] could be reintegrated in the same manner. However, over the following months, he distanced himself from this idea.

Saakashvili has also attempted to portray the Abkhaz dispute as being between Georgia and Russia, owing to the latter's support of the separatists, with the separatist government being portrayed as little more than a Russian puppet. To this end, they have pushed for either the complete removal of, or major changes to the mandate of, the Russian peacekeepers, and the removal of Russian military bases from Abkhaz territory. During 2003, they succeeded in achieving the latter demand, with Russia removing its bases, leaving only its peacekeeping force.

Both the Abkhazian government and opposition resolutely oppose reunification with Georgia under any circumstances.

Written in [[1792]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s '''''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman''''' is one of the earliest works on &quot;[[the woman question]]&quot; and influenced the earliest [[feminism|feminists]] in [[England]] and [[United States|America]] in the [[19th century]], primarily in their distancing themselves from the work due to the controversial life of its author.

Some major themes of this work are [[education]] for girls, the debased position of women in society, the necessary [[social equality|equality]] of men and women, and the right of women to work.  

Shortly after publication, an anonymous parody appeared entitled &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Beasts,&quot; in which the author (now known to be Cambridge Philosopher [[Thomas Taylor]]) applied all of Wollstonecraft's arguments to the rights of animals, showing that the same justifications that kept women subservient, could also be applied to animals.

The '''Afghan Hound''' is a very old [[sighthound]] [[dog]] [[dog breed|breed]]. Distinguished by its thick, fine, silky coat and its tail  with a ring curl at the end, the breed acquired its unique features in the cold mountains of [[Afghanistan]], where it was originally used to hunt [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, and [[gazelle]]s. 

==Appearance==
[[Image:Afghan-Hound.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Afghan with reddish coat]]
The Afghan Hound is high-stationed, standing 24 to 28 inches (61-71 cm) in height and weighing 45 to 60 pounds (23-28 kg). The coat may be any colour, but white markings, particularly on the head, are discouraged; many individuals have a black facial mask. However all Afghan Hounds have a white &quot;blaze&quot; on the chest. Some are almost white, but particolor hounds (white with islands of red or black) are not acceptable and may indicate impure breeding.  The long, fine-textured coat requires considerable care and grooming. The long topknot and the shorter-haired saddle on the back in the mature dog are distinctive features of the Afghan Hound coat. The high hipbones and unique small ring on the end of the tail are also characteristics of the breed.

==Temperament==
The temperament of the Afghan Hound is aloof and dignified, but happy and clownish when playing. The breed has the reputation of being the least intelligent dog breed, though this is not necessarily true.  The Afghan Hound has many cat-like tendencies and is not slavish in its [[obedience training|obedience]] as are some other breeds. The Afghan hound has a leaning towards independence. Owners should not be surprised if their Afghan hounds sometimes choose to ignore commands. Although seldom used today for hunting in [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]] where they are popular, Afghans are frequent participants in [[lure coursing]] events and are popular as [[show dog]]s.

==Health==
Afghans are a relatively healthy breed; major health issues are [[allergy|allergies]], and [[cancer]]. Sensitivity to [[anaesthesia]] is an issue the Afghan hound shares with the rest of the [[sighthound]] group, as sighthounds have relatively low levels of body fat.

Afghan hounds as a whole are a fairly long-lived breed, often living 13-14 years.

==History==
The breed was always thought to date back at least to the pre-Christian era, and recent discoveries by researchers studying ancient DNA have revealed that the Afghan Hound is in fact one of the most [[ancient dog breeds]], dating back for many thousands of years. Its original native name, ''Tazi'', betrays its connection to the very similar [[Tasy]] breed of [[Russia]]. The proximity of southern [[Russia]] and [[Afghanistan]] argue for a common origin for both breeds. 

Initially, Afghani people refused to sell their national dog to outsiders; the breed was not seen in [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]] until after the turn of the [[20th century]]. [[American Kennel Club|AKC]] and [[CKC]] did not recognise the Afghan Hound until the 1930s. 

On August 3, 2005, Korean scientist [[Hwang Woo-Suk]] announced that his team of researchers had become the first team to successfully [[cloning|clone]] a dog. The dog, an Afghan Hound, was named [[Snuppy]]. Later that year, a pattern of lies and fraud by [[Hwang Woo-Suk]] came to light, throwing in doubt all his claims. Snuppy, nonetheless, was [http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/01/09/skorea.stemcell.ap/index.html a genuine clone], and thus the first cloned dog in history. (&quot;The panel found that Hwang's claims last year to have created the world's first cloned dog, however, were genuine.&quot;)

The '''Azawakh''' is a [[sight hound]] [[dog breed]] from [[Africa]]. 

==Appearance==
Rangy, leggy, lean, and elegant, the Azawakh is extremely high-stationed, taller than it is long. Its back length should be 90 percent of its leg length to [[withers]] (shoulder blades).  It has a deep chest, which should not go below the elbows, and a high tuck/waist.

The breed weighs from  33 to 55 pounds (15-25 kg); its height is 24 to 29 inches (60-74 cm). The coat is very short and almost absent on the belly.  Its bone structure shows clearly through the skin and musculature. Its muscles lie quite flat, unlike the [[Greyhound]], and in this respect it is closer to the [[Saluki]].

Colours permitted by the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale|FCI]] breed standard are clear sand to dark fawn/brown, red and brindle (with or without a dark mask), with white bib, tail tip, and white on all feet (which can be tips of toes to high stockings).  Currently, white stockings that go above the elbow joint are considered disqualifying features in France, as is a white collar or half collar.  Many other colours occur in [[Africa]] such as black, blue fawn (that is, with a lilac cast), grizzle, and blue.  The Azawakh in its native land also comes in [[particolour]].  Blue [[brindle]] is also found in about 0.5% of the population; this is a normal recessive gene which again does not meet current FCI standards. The Azawakh&amp;rsquo;s light, supple, elastic gait is a notable breed characteristic, as is a 'bouncy gallop'.

Azawakhs need to be well socialised from an early age and should be challenged with new situations.

They are a combination of a sprinter (though not as fast as a Greyhound) and a long distance runner (like a Saluki).  Therefore they need a good to high level of exercise and should have regular runs off lead in large enclosed areas to run off steam.

==Temperament==
It manages to balance a close bond with its owner with a strong, almost feline independence.  Attentive, distant, reserved with strangers, Azawakhs are gentle and affectionate with those they accept.

==History==
Bred by the [[Tuareg]] nomads of the [[Sahara]] and sub-Saharan [[Sahel]] in the countries of [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Burkina Faso]], the breed is used there as a [[guard dog]] and to hunt [[gazelle]] and [[hare]] at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. Unlike some other Afro-Asian sighthounds it is more of a pack hunter and they bump down the quarry with hindquarters when it has been tired out.  The [[Sloughi]], by comparison, is more of an independent lone hunter and has a high hunting instinct.

They are relatively uncommon in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] but there is a growing band of devotees.  It is not a 'doggy' dog, being very feline in temperamanet and therefore not a good pet for mainstream owners.  However, well socialised and trained, they can be good with cats, children, and strangers.  The breed is not yet registered by [[CKC]] or [[American Kennel Club|AKC]] (but is recorded in AKC&amp;rsquo;s Foundation Stock Service); it is registered with [[United Kennel Club|UKC]], [[ARBA]] and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Acrylic paint''' is fast-drying [[paint]] containing pigment suspended in an [[Wiktionary:acrylic|acrylic]] polymer [[emulsion]]. Acrylic paints can be diluted with water, but become water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted (with water), the finished acrylic painting can resemble a [[watercolor painting|watercolor]] or an [[oil painting]].

Acrylics were first available commercially in the 1940s,  although experimental forms of acrylic resin paints had been developed as early as the 1920s in the U.S. and earlier in Germany. The first commercially available acrylic paints were actually oil compatible.  

Acrylics are sometimes used in place of watercolors because acrylics dry closer to the desired color (slightly darker, usually) while watercolors dry lighter (and often unpredictably, especially for beginning artists).  

Acrylics are often used as an alternative to [[oil paint]]s because acrylics dry much faster (usually within an hour or even as little as less than a minute, depending on brand and thickness of application). Oil paints, which consist of pigment suspended in an oil (usually [[flax|linseed]], or other natural oil) base, can take a very long time to dry:  a few weeks or as long as several months.  Acrylic paints can achieve an oil-paint-like effect, and do so in much less time. Though applied to look like oil paints, acrylics are somewhat limited due to the superior color range of oil paints,{{fact}} and the fact that acrylic paints dry to a shiny, smooth effect&amp;mdash;not surprising since acrylic paints are, basically, plastic. Accordingly, acrylic paint cannot be removed with [[turpentine]], mineral spirits (also known as white spirits), [[ammonia]], or [[rubbing alcohol]].

Acrylic painters modify the appearance, hardness, flexibility, texture, and other characteristics of the paint surface using acrylic media. Watercolor and oil painters also use various media, but the range of acrylic media is much greater.  Acrylics have the ability to bond to many different surfaces, and media can be used to adjust their binding characteristics. Media can change the sheen from gloss to matte, or can add iridescence or texture to the surface. They can also be used to build thick layers of paint: gel and molding paste media are sometimes used to create paintings with relief features that are literally sculptural.  

Acrylic paints are the most commonly used in [[surrealist techniques|grattage]] (''q.v.'').

Acrylic paintings, ideally, should be recognized as being as different from oil paintings as watercolors are — in other words, as a distinct art medium with its own advantages as well as limitations, rather than as a stand-in for another meduim. There are techniques which are available only to acrylic painters, as well as restrictions unique to acrylic painting. Therefore, judging an acrylic painting as though it were an oil painting (or a watercolor) is not always appropriate.

Although the permanency of acrylics is sometimes debated by conservators, they appear more stable than oil paints.  Whereas oil paints normally turn yellow as they age/dry(oxidize), acrylic paints, at least in the 50 years since invention, do not yellow, crack, or change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[physics]] the '''angular momentum''' of an object with respect to a reference point is a measure for the extent to which, and the direction in which, the object rotates about the reference point.

In particular, if the body rotates about an axis, then the angular momentum with respect to a point on the axis is related to the [[mass]] of the object, the [[angular velocity]] and the distance of the mass to the axis.

Without applying [[torque]] to the object, with respect to the reference point, the angular momentum is constant. The angular momentum is a measure for the amount of torque that has been applied over time to the object. The object has [[Inertia#Rotational_inertia|rotational inertia]] that resists changes in rotational [[motion]], quantified by the [[moment of inertia]].

Angular momentum is an important concept in both physics and engineering with numerous applications.  For example, the [[kinetic energy]] stored in a massive rotating object such as a [[flywheel]] is proportional to the angular momentum.

== Angular momentum in classical mechanics ==

===Definition===

The traditional mathematical definition of the angular momentum of a particle about some origin is:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;

:where 

::'''L''' is the angular momentum of the particle, 
::'''r''' is the position of the particle expressed as a displacement vector from the origin,
::'''p''' is the [[Momentum|linear momentum]] of the particle, and
::&lt;math&gt;\times \,&lt;/math&gt; is the vector [[cross product]].
Because of the cross product, '''L''' is a [[pseudovector]] perpendicular to both the radial vector '''r''' and the momentum vector '''p'''.

If a system consists of several particles, the total angular momentum about an origin can be obtained by adding (or integrating) all the angular momenta of the constituent particles. Angular momentum can also be calculated by multiplying the square of the displacement ''r'', the [[mass]] of the particle and the [[angular velocity]].

For many applications where one is only concerned about rotation around one axis, it is sufficient to discard the pseudovector nature of angular momentum, and treat it like a scalar where it is positive when it corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotations, and negative clockwise. To do this, just take the definition of the cross product and discard the unit vector, so that angular momentum becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;L = |\mathbf{r}||\mathbf{p}|\sin\theta_{r,p}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''&amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;r,p&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the angle between '''r''' and '''p''' measured from '''r''' to '''p'''; an important distinction because without it, the sign of the cross product would be meaningless. From the above, it is possible to reformulate the definition to either of the following:

:&lt;math&gt;L = \pm|\mathbf{p}||\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{perpendicular}}|&lt;/math&gt;

where '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;perpendicular&lt;/sub&gt; is called the ''[[lever]] arm distance'' to '''p'''. 

The easiest way to conceptualize this is to consider the lever arm distance to be the distance from the origin to the line that '''p''' travels along. With this definition, it is necessary to consider the direction of '''p''' (pointed clockwise or counter-clockwise) to figure out the sign of L. Equivalently:

:&lt;math&gt;L = \pm|\mathbf{r}||\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{perpendicular}}|&lt;/math&gt;

where '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;perpendicular&lt;/sub&gt; is the component of '''p''' that is perpendicular to '''r'''. As above, the sign is decided base on the sense of rotation.

For an object with a fixed mass that is rotating about a fixed symmetry axis,
the angular momentum is expressed as the product of the [[moment of inertia]] of the object and its angular
velocity vector:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}= I \mathbf{\omega} &lt;/math&gt; 

where 

''I'' is the [[moment of inertia]] of the object

'''&amp;omega;''' is the [[angular velocity]].

===Conservation of angular momentum===

In analogy to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]] for linear momentum, we have the following [[Proof of angular momentum|law about angular momentum]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \boldsymbol{\tau} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''&amp;tau;''' is the net [[torque]] about the origin.

This implies that angular momentum is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]] as long as there is no net torque applied to the particle. What's more, this conservation can be generalized to a system of particles under most conditions so that:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{\mathrm{system}} =  \mathrm{constant} \Leftrightarrow \sum \tau_{\mathrm{external}} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''&amp;tau;'''&lt;sub&gt;external&lt;/sub&gt; is any torque applied to the system of particles. 

In orbits, the angular momentum is distributed within the spin of the planet itself, and the angular momentum of its orbit:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{\mathrm{total}} = \mathbf{L}_{\mathrm{spin}} + \mathbf{L}_{\mathrm{orbit}}
&lt;/math&gt;

If a planet is found to rotate slower than expected, then astronomers suspect that the planet is accompanied by a satellite, because the total angular momentum is shared amongst the planet and its satellite in order to be conserved.

The conservation of angular momentum is used extensively in analyzing what is called ''central force motion''. In central force motion, two bodies form an isolated system not influenced by outside forces, and the origin is placed somewhere on the line between the two bodies. Since any force the bodies exert on each other must be directed along this line, there can be no net torque, with respect to the aforementioned origin, on either body. Thus, angular momentum is conserved. Constant angular momentum is extremely useful when dealing with the [[orbit]]s of [[planet]]s and [[satellite]]s, and also when analyzing the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]]!

== Angular momentum in relativistic mechanics ==

In modern (late [[20th century]]) theoretical physics, angular momentum is described using a different formalism. Under this formalism, angular momentum is the [[2-form]] [[Noether charge]] associated with rotational invariance (As a result, angular momentum isn't conserved for general curved spacetimes, unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariant). For a system of point particles without any intrinsic angular momentum, it turns out to be

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i \bold{r}_i\wedge \bold{p}_i&lt;/math&gt; 

(Here, the [[wedge product]] is used.).

== Angular momentum in quantum mechanics ==

In [[quantum mechanics]], angular momentum is defined like [[momentum# Momentum in quantum mechanics |momentum]] - not as a quantity but as an [[operator]] on the [[wave function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''r''' and '''p''' are the position and momentum operators respectively. In particular, for a single particle with no [[electric charge]] and no [[spin (physics)|spin]], the angular momentum operator can be written in the position basis as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=-i\hbar(\mathbf{r}\times\nabla)&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;nabla; is the [[gradient]] operator.  This symbol is also called the [[Laplacian operator]], read as &quot;del&quot;. This is a commonly encountered form of the angular momentum operator, though not the most general one. It has the following properties

:&lt;math&gt;[L_i, L_j ] = i \hbar \epsilon_{ijk} L_k&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\left[L_i, L^2 \right] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and even more importantly [[commutator|commutes]] with the [[hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|hamiltonian]] of such a chargeless and spinless particle

:&lt;math&gt;\left[L_i, H \right] = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Angular Momentum operators usually occur when solving a problem with [[spherical symmetry]] in [[spherical coordinates]]. Then, the angular momentum in space representation is:
:: &lt;math&gt;\ L^2 = \frac{1}{\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left( \sin\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right) + \frac{1}{\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \phi^2} &lt;/math&gt;
When solving to find [[eigenstate]]s of this operator, we obtain the following
:: &lt;math&gt; L^2 | l, m \rang = {\hbar}^2 l(l+1) | l, m \rang &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; L_z | l, m \rang = \hbar m | l, m \rang &lt;/math&gt;
where
::&lt;math&gt; \lang \theta , \phi | l, m \rang = Y_{l,m}(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;
are the [[spherical harmonic]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Plum_pudding_atom.svg|right|thumb|250x|A schematic representation of the plum pudding model of the atom.]]

In [[physics]], the '''Plum pudding model''' of the [[atom]] was proposed by [[J. J. Thomson]], the discoverer of the electron, before the discovery of the [[proton]] or [[neutron]]. In this model, the atom is composed of electrons surrounded by a soup of positive charge, like [[plum]]s surrounded by [[pudding]]. The electrons were thought to be positioned uniformly throughout the atom. Instead of a soup, the atom was also sometimes said to have had a cloud of positive charge. The model was disproved by [[Ernest Rutherford]]'s [[gold foil experiment]], when he discovered the nucleus of the atom, thus leading to the [[Rutherford model]] of the atom.

This model can be compared to a British treat called [[plum pudding]], hence the name. It is also known as the '''chocolate chip cookie model'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[physics]], '''atomic theory''' is a [[theory]] of the nature of [[matter]]. It states that all matter is composed of [[atom]]s.  The [[philosophy|philosophical]] background of the atomic theory is called [[atomism]]. The theory applies to the common [[phases of matter]], namely [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s and [[gas]]ses, as directly experienced on Earth. Strictly speaking, it is not the appropriate theory for [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] or [[neutron star]]s where unusual environments such as extremes of temperature or density prevent atoms from forming.

==Importance ==
Arguably, the atomic theory is one of the most important theories in the [[history of science]], with wide-ranging implications for both pure and applied [[science]]. The theory is largely credited to [[John Dalton]], an 18th- and [[19th century]] British chemist.

Modern [[chemistry]] (and [[biochemistry]]) is based upon the theory that all matter is made up of atoms of different [[chemical element|elements]], which cannot be [[transmutation|transmuted]] by chemical means. In turn, chemistry has allowed for the development of the [[pharmaceutical]] industry, the [[petrochemical]] industry, and many others.

Much of [[thermodynamics]] is understandable in terms of [[kinetic theory]], whereby gases are considered to be made up of either atoms or [[molecule]]s, behaving in accordance with [[Newton's laws of motion]]. This was, in turn, a large driving force behind the [[industrial revolution]].

Indeed, many [[macroscopic]] properties of matter are best understood in terms of atoms. Other examples include [[friction]], [[material science]] and [[semiconductor]] theory. The latter is particularly important, as it is the foundation of [[electronics]].

==History==
From the [[6th century BC]], [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]] and [[Jain]]a philosophers in [[ancient India]] developed the earliest atomic theories. The first philosopher who formulated ideas about the atom in a systematic manner was [[Kanada]] who lived in the 6th century BC. Another Indian philosopher, Pakudha Katyayana who also lived in the 6th century BC and was a contemporary of [[Gautama Buddha]], had also propounded ideas about the atomic constitution of the material world. Indian atomists believed that an atom could be one of upto six elements, with each element having upto 24 properties. They developed detailed theories of how atoms could combine, react, vibrate, move, and perform other actions, and had particularly elaborate theories of how atoms combine, which explains how atoms first combine in pairs, and then group into trios of pairs, which are the smallest visible units of matter. This parallels with the structure of modern atomic theory, in which pairs or triplets of supposedly fundamental quarks combine to create most typical forms of matter. They had also suggested the possibility of splitting an atom which, as we know today, is the source of atomic energy. (See [[Atomism#Indian atomism|Indian atomism]] for more details.)

The existence of atoms was also proposed in the [[5th century BC]] by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers [[Leucippus]] and his pupil [[Democritus]], for which they were called ''atomists''. They argued that all observed phenomena can be in principle explained by the motion of unchanging particles called atoms. Atomism was taken as the basis for a rational world philosophy by the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]]. The greatest extant Greek treatise on atomic theory and its implications for religion, human life, the existence of the soul, and death, is ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' (&quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;), written in the [[1st century BC]] by [[Lucretius Carus]].

Since Lucretius' work contradicted Christian concepts of an immortal soul (if the soul is composed of atoms, it must perforce perish upon death; therefore there is no afterlife), it was actively suppressed by Christian writers. The concept thus disappeared in Europe until the end of the [[Middle Ages]].

During the Middle Ages (the [[Islamic Golden Age]]), [[Islam]]ic atomists developed atomic theories that represent a synthesis of both Greek and Indian atomism. (See [[Atomism|Islamic atomism]] for more details.) Older Greek and Indian ideas were further developed by Islamic atomists, along with new Islamic ideas, such as the possibility of there being particles smaller than an atom. As Islamic influence began spreading through Europe, the ideas of Islamic atomism, along with the older ideas of Greek and Indian atomism, spread throughout Europe by the end of the Middle Ages, where modern atomic theories began taking shape.

A modern atomic theory was developed by [[Rudjer Boscovich]] in the [[18th century]], and after that applied in chemistry by [[John Dalton]]. Boscovich based his theory mostly on [[classical mechanics]] ([[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] mechanics) and published it in [[1758]]. The theory was further developed by [[Amedeo Avogadro]] and the developers of the [[kinetic theory of gases]] such as [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]].

In the late [[19th century]], a movement led by [[Ernst Mach]], [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], and [[Karl Pearson]] rejected the atomic theory on [[epistemology|epistemological]] grounds. The dispute was not finally settled until [[Jean Perrin]]'s experimental investigation of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s mathematical theory of [[Brownian motion]] in the early [[20th century]].

Although Dalton was the founder of modern atomic theory, the evolution of atomic theory did not stop there.  [[Ernest Rutherford]] was a major contributor to the atomic model because he proved that although Dalton and Thompson were partially correct there was still a flaw in both of their models of the atom in that the atom consisted mostly of space. In [[1911]], Rutherford's [[gold foil experiment]] established that the mass of the atom is concentrated in its nucleus, disproving the [[plum pudding model]] of the atom.  Then in [[1915]], [[Niels Bohr]] further advanced atomic theory by developing  the [[Bohr model of the atom]], which soon led to the development of the modern quantum atom.  Up until [[1932]], the prevailing atomic theory had provided evidence for the electron orbiting a nucleus with protons, but it wasn't until that year that [[James Chadwick]] added the discovery of the neutron to atomic theory.  The study of these [[subatomic particle]]s eventually lead to the current [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]].

==Dalton's Atomic Theory==
* [[Elements]] are made of tiny particles called [[atoms]].
* All [[atoms]] of a given [[element]] are identical.
* The [[atoms]] of a given [[element]] are different than those of any other [[element]].
* [[Atoms]] of one [[element]] can combine with [[atoms]] of other elements to form [[compounds]].  A given [[compound]] always has the same relative numbers of types of [[atoms]].  
* [[Atoms]] are indivisible in chemical processes.  [[Atoms]] are not created nor destroyed in [[chemical reactions]].  A chemical reaction simply changes the way [[atoms]] are grouped together.

:''This article is about the word &quot;''asshole''&quot;. For the card game sometimes known as &quot;Asshole&quot;, see [[President (game)]]. For the chemical compound, see [[Arsole]].''

'''Asshole''' or '''arsehole''' (outside of [[North America]]) is a [[slang]]  term referring to the [[anus]]. The word is mainly used as a [[profanity]] towards someone the speaker does not like or to express deep contempt for someone whose behavior is hurtful, self-centered or particularly abrasive. Usually, the person to whom this term is directed is a male.  It may also sometimes be used to describe people who are viewed as &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;useless.&quot;

This word or its literal translation is found in colloquial speech in a number of [[culture]]s (in both [[English language|English]] and other [[language]]s). This is due to the fact that it describes an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] of [[defecation|elimination]] that is considered a [[taboo]] region (belonging to the [[intimate parts]]) of the body in many [[society|societies]].

The English word ''ass'' (meaning [[donkey]], derived from the same root as its zoological name ''Equus '''asinus''''') may also be used as a term of contempt, referring to a silly or stupid person. In [[North America]], the words ''arse'' and ''ass'' have become [[synonym]]ous; however in the rest of the world, ''ass'' still only refers to the donkey, rather than the ''arse'' ([[buttock]]s).  It is worth noting that some varieties of English [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|drop the letter &quot;R&quot;]], leading to practically identical pronunciations of ''ass'' and ''arse''.

Until the early 1990s, the word was considered one of a number of words that could not be uttered on commercial television in the United States. Comedian [[Andrew Dice Clay]] caused a major shock  when he uttered the word during a televised awards show in the 1980s. By 1994, however, the word had become less  vulgar, and was often featured in dialogue on the long-running television series ''[[NYPD Blue]]''; it has yet to become anything close to commonplace on network TV, however.  It is important to note that while the word ''ass'' has found a place on broadcast television, ''asshole'' is not used, probably due to its more vulgar connotation.

In 1993, actor [[Denis Leary]] enjoyed some success with a comedic song called &quot;Asshole&quot; which opened his stage play ''[[No Cure For Cancer]]'' and was featured in a [[music video]] [http://www.milkandcookies.com/links/38718/]. It topped the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1993]] in Australia and subsequently reached #2 on the charts in that country in 1994. Alternative rock artist [[Beck]] has written and recorded a song called &quot;Asshole,&quot; one of his most acclaimed compositions. The British ska-punk band [[Snuff (band)|Snuff]] also have a song named &quot;Arsehole&quot;.

'''Asshat''' is a slightly more trendy and less severe variation of ''asshole'', graphically describing someone who has his &quot;head up his ass&quot; (i.e., not knowing what's going on), or a variation of &quot;butthead&quot;. In the former sense, it is suggested that one is wearing one's ass for a hat, or alternately, a hat for one's ass (Some people view it as that from the waist up, you are a hat for your own ass.).  A more modern usage of ''asshat'' describes a person doing something stupid, and can apply to anyone: &quot;The boss is up to asshattery because he broke the computer even though he knew he was doing the wrong thing.&quot; This meaning was popularized by [[Something Awful]] character [[Jeff K.]]

The word is popular in many online communities, serving as a more palatable version of its antecedent. According to [[Google]]'s Usenet statistics, the word only saw a token appearance every day or two starting in July, 1999, but following a slow rise in 2002, it entered popular usage in May, 2003.

As it continued to grow in [[popularity]], asshat began to be used by online gamers, in first person shooter and massive multiplayer role playing games. It was a commonplace word on servers where [[vulgar]] language was not allowed.

The insult &quot;assclown&quot; is used in a similar fashion, although it is not as common. &quot;Assclown&quot; has become well known among fans of the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] due to wrestler [[Chris Jericho]] using it during his promos, especially his &quot;Highlight Reel&quot;; the term was also famously used in the film ''[[Office Space]]'' to describe singer-songwriter [[Michael Bolton]].

Daw '''Aung San Suu Kyi''' ([[Burmese language|Burmese]]: [[Image:AungSanSuuKyi1.png]]), born [[June 19]], [[1945]] in [[Yangon]] (Rangoon), is a [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] pro-[[democracy]] activist in [[Myanmar]] (Burma). In 1990 the devout [[Buddhist]] won the [[Rafto Prize]] and the [[Sakharov Prize|Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought]]. In 1991 she won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her peaceful and non-violent struggle under a repressive military regime.

One of her most famous speeches is the ''Freedom From Fear'' speech which begins:

:&quot;''It is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it''.&quot;

==Political influences== 

Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of [[Khin Kyi]], a prominent Burmese diplomat, and General [[Aung San]], who negotiated Burma's independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1947 and was [[assassination|assassinated]] by rivals in the same year. She studied at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in the United Kingdom and at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]]. While in [[England]], Aung San Suu Kyi met and married [[Michael Aris]], a scholar of [[Tibet]]an culture. They had two sons, Alexander and Kim.

Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Myanmar in 1988 to care for her ailing mother. In that year, the long-time leader of the [[socialist]] ruling party, General [[Ne Win]], stepped down, leading to mass demonstrations for [[democracy|democratisation]], which were violently suppressed. A new military [[junta]] took power. 

Heavily influenced by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s philosophy of nonviolence, Aung San Suu Kyi entered politics to work for democratisation, helped found the [[National League for Democracy]] on [[September 27]], [[1988]], and was put under [[house arrest]] in 1989. She was offered freedom if she would leave the country, but she refused.

==Detention in Myanmar==

In 1990, the military junta called [[general election]]s, which the National League for Democracy won decisively. Under normal circumstances, she would have assumed the office of [[Prime Minister]]. Instead the results were nullified, and the military refused to hand over power. This resulted in an international outcry and partly led to Aung San Suu Kyi winning the Sakharov Prize that year and the Nobel Peace Prize in the following one. She used the Nobel Peace Prize's [[US$]]1.3 million prize money to establish a [[health]] and [[education]] trust for the Burmese people. 

She was released from house arrest in July 1995, although it was made clear that if she left the country to visit her family in the [[United Kingdom]], she would be denied re-entry. When her husband Michael Aris, a British citizen, was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in 1997, the Burmese government denied him an entry visa. Aung San Suu Kyi remained in Burma, and never again saw her husband, who died in March 1999. She remains separated from their children, who remain in the United Kingdom.

She was repeatedly prevented from meeting with her party supporters, and in September 2000 was again put under house arrest. On [[May 6]], [[2002]], following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the [[United Nations]], she was released; a government spokesman said that she was free to move &quot;because we are confident that we can trust each other&quot;. Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed &quot;a new dawn for the country&quot;. However on [[May 30]], [[2003]], her caravan was attacked in the northern village of [[Depayin]] by a government-sponsored mob, murdering and wounding many of her supporters. Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene with the help of her driver, Ko Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching Ye-U.  She was imprisoned at Insein Prison in Yangon. After a surgical operation in [[September]] [[2003]], she was again placed under house arrest in Yangon.

On [[November 28]], [[2005]], the National League for Democracy confirmed that Suu Kyi's house arrest would be extended for yet another year. Many western countries, as well as the [[United Nations]], have expressed their disapproval of this latest extension.

===International supporters===

In 2001, Irish rock band [[U2]] released the single ''[[Walk On (song)|Walk On]]'', which was written about and dedicated to Aung San Suu Kyi. &quot;Walk On&quot; was banned by the junta. During concerts in [[London]] and [[Glasgow]] ([[June 19]] and [[June 21]] 2005 respectively) U2 dedicated performances of &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot; to Aung San Suu Kyi. Other artists such as [[Coldplay]], [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]], and [[Damien Rice]] have also been publicly supportive of Aung San Suu Kyi's cause.

On [[December 2]], [[2004]], the [[United States]] pressured the Myanmar government to release Aung San Suu Kyi after the announcement that her [[house arrest]] would be extended. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4064211.stm (BBC)]

On [[June 17]], [[2005]], several countries from around the world held protests outside Myanmar embassies, in recognition of Suu Kyi's 60th birthday, which took place on June 19, 2005. The protests received international attention. 

In late November 2005, the [[United States]] again returned to diplomatic pressure, this time in the [[United Nations]] [[Security Council]], strongly urging multilateral action to address the &quot;deteriorating situation&quot; in [[Myanmar]], requesting to put it into the official agenda docket. This action was due largely to a reinstatement of Aung San Suu Kyi's [[house arrest]], an extension of precisely one year.

She is featured prominently in [[John Boorman]]'s [[1995]] film ''[[Beyond Rangoon]]'', starring [[Patricia Arquette]].

Aung San Suu Kyi has been an honourary board member of [[Institute_for_Democracy_and_Electoral_Assistance|International IDEA]] and [[ARTICLE 19]] since her detention, and has received support from these organisations.

The '''Armenian alphabet''' is an [[alphabet]] used for writing the [[Armenian language]], created by Saint [[Mesrop Mashtots]] in AD [[405]]. 

The Armenian alphabet is one of six European alphabetic scripts identified in the [[Unicode]] standard (see [http://www.unicode.org/charts/ Unicode Code Charts] and [http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch07.pdf Unicode Standard, Chapter 7]).

Various scripts have been credited with being the prototype for the Armenian alphabet, including [[Pahlavi]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], and [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]]. However, the order of the letters, the use of the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ou'' for the vowel {{IPA|[u]}}, and a noticeable similarity of letter forms to cursive Greek suggests that it was likely based on the [[Greek alphabet]]. 

As Bedross Der Matossian from [[Columbia University]] informs, for about 250 years, from the early [[18th century]] until around [[1950]], more than 2000 books were printed in the [[Turkish language]] using letters of the Armenian alphabet. Not only Armenians read Armeno-Turkish, but also the non-Armenian (including the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkish) elite.

Armenian has two different dialects: Eastern and Western. Both use the same alphabet, however some of the letters have different names and pronunciations. For example, the second letter in Eastern Armenian is &quot;ben&quot; and makes a 'b' sound while in Western Armenian, the second letter is &quot;pen&quot; and makes a 'p' sound.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rabbi '''Abraham Joshua Heschel''' ([[January 11]], [[1907]], [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] &amp;ndash; [[December 23]], [[1972]]) was considered by many to be one of the most significant [[Jew]]ish theologians of the 20th century.

Heschel was a descendant of preeminent [[rabbi]]nic families of [[Europe]], both on his father's (Moshe Mordechai Heschel, who died of influenza in 1916) and mother's (Reizel Perlow Heschel) side.  He was the youngest of six children including his siblings: Sarah, Dvora Miriam, Esther Sima, Gittel, and Jacob. In his teens he received a traditional [[yeshiva]] education, and obtained traditional [[semicha]], rabbinical ordination. He then studied at the [[University of Berlin]], where he obtained his doctorate, and at the [[Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums]], where he earned a second liberal rabbinic ordination.

Heschel's teachers included some of the best German-Jewish teachers: [[Chanoch Albeck]], [[Ismar Elbogen]], [[Julius Guttmann]], and [[Leo Baeck]]. He later taught the [[Talmud]] there. Escaping from the Nazis, he found refuge both in [[England]] and [[United States|America]], where he briefly served on the faculty of [[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), the main seminary of [[Reform Judaism]], in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]].

Increasingly uncomfortable with the lack of observance of [[halakha|Jewish law]] at HUC, Heschel sought an academic institution where critical, modern scholarship of the Bible was allowed, and yet also held that Jewish law was normative. He found such a place in [[1946]] when he came to the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTS), the main seminary of [[Conservative Judaism]]. He accepted a position there as Professor of Jewish Ethics and [[Kabbalah|Mysticism]], where he served until his death in [[1972]].

Heschel explicated many facets of Jewish thought including studies on medieval Jewish [[philosophy]], [[Kabbalah]], and [[Hasidism]]. He has a special interest in the prophets, and in the proper way for Jews to incorporate religion into their lives. His books contain civil but pointed rejoinders towards those in [[Reform Judaism]] who no longer held that Jewish law was normative, and also towards those in [[Orthodox Judaism]], who Heschel held valued [[legalism]] over the spirit of the law.

Heschel did not fully fit in JTS either, however. He was more interested in spirituality than critical text study, which was a specialty of scholars at JTS. A similar disconnect between him and much of JTS faculty were due to his views on the Hebrew prophets and social justice. Heschel saw the teachings of the Hebrew prophets as a clarion call for social action in the United States, but his social activism was at the time dismissed as unimportant by most JTS faculty. They saw their job as academics and educators, and left the role of social activism to pulpit rabbis and laypeople. In later years there would be a sea change in how JTS faculty viewed this position; today most JTS faculty are more involved in social activism, and some have written that it was a mistake for JTS not to follow Heschel's lead at that time.

Heschel was particularly looked down upon by his colleague [[Mordechai Kaplan]], founder of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], and many students who attended JTS in the [[1950s|50s]] sympathized with Kaplan over Heschel.

He married [[Sylvia Straus]] on [[December 10]], [[1946]], in [[Los Angeles]]. They had a daughter named Susannah. [[Susannah Heschel]] eventually became a scholar of Judaism in her own right.

Heschel was also known as an activist for [[civil rights]] in the USA, and an activist for freedom for [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Soviet Jewry]]. He is one of the few Jewish theologians widely read by Christians. His most influential works include ''Man is Not Alone'', ''God in Search of Man'', ''The Sabbath'', and ''The Prophets''.

His life's work has inspired three namesake schools: one on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[New York City]], one in [[Northridge, California]], and one in [[Toronto]].

==Works==

===''The Prophets''===
This work started out as his Ph.D. thesis in German, which he later expanded and translated into English. Originally published in a two-volume edition, this work studies the books of the Hebrew prophets. It covers their life, the historical context that their missions were set in, summarizes their work, and discusses their psychological state. Heschel gives a detailed treatment of the entire phenomenon of prophecy, what it is, and what it means.

===''The Sabbath''===
''The Sabbath: Its Meaning For Modern Man'' is a work on the nature and celebration of [[Shabbat]], the Jewish Sabbath. This work is rooted in the thesis that Judaism is a religion of time, not space, and that the Sabbath symbolizes the sanctification of time.

===''Man is Not Alone''===
''Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion'' offers Heschel's views on how man can apprehend God. Judaism views God as being radically different than man, so Heschel explores the ways that Judaism teaches that a person may have an encounter with the ineffable. A recurring theme in this work is the radical amazement that man experiences when experiencing the presence of the Divine. Heschel then goes to explore the problems of doubts and faith; what Judaism means by teaching that God is one; the essence of man and the problem of man's needs; the definition of religion in general and of Judaism in particular; and man's yearning for spirituality. He offers his views as to Judaism being a pattern for life.

===''God in Search of Man''===
''God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism'' is a companion volume to ''Man is Not Alone''. In this book Heschel discusses the nature of religious thought, how thought becomes faith, and how faith creates responses in the believer. He discusses ways that man can seek God's presence, and the radical amazement that man receives in return. He offers a criticism of nature worship; a study of man's metaphysical loneliness, and his view that we can consider God to be in search of man. The first section concludes with a study of [[Jews as a chosen people]]. Section two deals with the idea of [[revelation]], and what it means for one to be a prophet. This section gives us his idea of revelation as a process, as opposed to an event. This relates to Israel's commitment to God.  Section three discusses his views of how a Jew should understand the nature of Judaism as a religion. He discusses and rejects the idea that mere faith (without law) alone is enough, but then cautions against rabbis he sees as adding too many restrictions to Jewish law. He discusses the need to correlate ritual observance with spirituality and love, the importance of Kavvanah (intention) when performing mitzvot. He engages in a discussion of religious behaviorism &amp;mdash; when people strive for external compliance with the law, yet disregard the importance of inner devotion.

===''Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets''===
Heschel wrote a series of articles, originally in Hebrew, on the existence of prophecy in Judaism after the destruction of the Holy [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in [[70]] CE. These essays were translated into English and published as ''Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets: Maimonides and Others'' by the American Judaica publisher [[Ktav]].

The publisher of this book states, &quot;The standard Jewish view is that prophecy ended with the ancient prophets, somewhere early in the Second Temple era. Heschel demonstrated that this view is not altogether accurate. Belief in the possibility of continued prophetic inspiration, and in its actual occurrence appear throughout much of the medieval period, and even in modern times. Heschel's work on prophetic inspiration in the Middle Ages originally appeared in two Hebrew long articles. In them he concentrated on the idea that prophetic inspiration was possible even in post-Talmudic times, and, indeed, had taken place at various times and in various schools, from the Geonim to Maimonides and beyond.&quot;

===''Torah min HaShamayim'' (Heavenly Torah)===
Many consider Heschel's ''Torah min HaShamayim BeAsafklariah shel HaDorot'', (''Torah from Heaven in the light of the generations'') to be his masterwork.  The three volumes of this work are a study of classical rabbinic theology and aggadah, as opposed to halakha (Jewish law.)  It explores the views of the rabbis in the Mishnah, Talmud and Midrash about the nature of Torah, the revelation of God to mankind, prophecy, and the ways that Jews have used scriptural exegesis to expand and understand these core Jewish texts. In this work Heschel views the second century sages Rabbis Akiva and Ishmael as paradigms for the two dominant worldviews in Jewish theology.

Two Hebrew volumes were published during his lifetime by [[Soncino Press]], and the third Hebrew volume was published post-homously by JTS Press in the 1990s. An English translation of all three volumes, with notes, essays and appendices, was translated and edited by Rabbi [[Gordon Tucker]], entitled ''Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations''.

'''Aberdeen Bestiary''' (Aberdeen University Library MS 24) is a [[12th century]] [[bestiary]] that was first listed in [[1542]] in the inventory of the [[Old Royal Library]] at the [[Palace of Westminster]]. 

Information about its origins and patron are circumstantial. It probably comes from the [[12th century]] and was owned by an ecclesiastical patron of the north or south province. The Aberdeen Bestiary is related to other bestiaries of the [[Middle Ages]] and especially the [[Ashmole Bestiary]]. Some even argue that the Aberdeen Bestiary might be the older of the two.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Asociación Latinoamericana de Integración''' (the '''Latin American Integration Association'''; known as '''ALADI''' or, occasionally, by the English acronym '''LAIA''') is a [[Latin America]]n trade integration association, based in [[Montevideo]]. Its main objective is the establishment of a common market, in pursuit of the economic and social development of the region. Its members are [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]].

The [[1980 Montevideo Treaty]], signed on [[August 12]] [[1980]], is the global legal framework that establishes and governs ALADI. It sets the following general principles: pluralism, convergence, flexibility, differential treatment and multiplicity.

The ALADI promotes the creation of an area of economic preferences in the region, aiming at a Latin American common market, through three mechanisms:

*Regional tariff preference granted to products originating in the member countries, based on the tariffs in force for third countries
*Regional scope agreement, among member countries
*Partial scope agreements, between two or more countries of the area

Either regional or partial scope agreements may cover tariff relief and trade promotion; economic complementation; agricultural trade; financial, fiscal, customs and health cooperation; environmental conservation; scientific and technological cooperation; tourism promotion; technical standards and many other fields.

As the Montevideo Treaty is a &quot;framework treaty&quot;, by subscribing to it, the governments of the member countries authorize their representatives to legislate through agreements on the economic issues of greatest importance to each country.

A system of preferences &amp;mdash; which consists of market opening lists, special cooperation programs (business rounds, preinvestment, financing, technological support) and countervailing measures on behalf of the landlocked countries &amp;mdash; has been granted to the countries deemed to be less developed (Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay), to favour their full participation in the integration process.

Any Latin-American country can join the 1980 Montevideo Treaty. [[Cuba]] was the last to accede, becoming a full member on [[August 26]], [[1999]]. In addition, ALADI is also open to all Latin American countries through agreements with other countries and integration areas of the continent, as well as to other developing countries or their respective integration areas outside Latin America.

As the institutional and normative &quot;umbrella&quot; of regional integration that shelters these agreements as well as the subregional ones ([[Andean Community]], [[MERCOSUR]], [[G-3 Free Trade Agreement]], etc.) it is the aim of the Association to support and favour every effort in order to create a common economic area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aircraft spotting'''  or '''Plane spotting''' is a [[hobby]] involving the enjoyment, observation and photography of [[aircraft]]: [[glider|gliders]], powered aircraft, large balloons, [[airship|airships]], [[helicopter|helicopters]], and microlights. 

[[image:virginatl.over.heathrow.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340. The picture was taken from Myrtle Avenue, an excellent '''aircraft spotting''' location at the south east corner of [[London Heathrow Airport]].]]

When spotting planes, observers notice the key attributes of an aircraft.  They may notice a distinctive noise from its engine(s) or the number of vapour trails it is leaving against a blue sky. They will assess the size of the plane and the number, type and position of its engines.  Another clue is the position of wings relative to the fuselage and the degree to which they are swept rearwards.  Are the wings above the fuselage, below it, or fixed at midpoint?  Perhaps it is a [[biplane]] or triplane.  The position of the tailplane relative to the fin(s) and the shape of the fin are also clues to its type. If it is an antique or light aircraft it might have a tail wheel.  Some aircraft types have a fixed [[undercarriage]] whilst others have retractable wheels.  Other features may come into view, the speed, cockpit placement, colour scheme or special equipment that changes the silhouette of the plane.  Taken together these clues will rapidly hasten the correct identification of a plane.  Obviously some types are easily confused whilst others have a more distinctive appearance.  If the observer is familiar with the airfield being used by the aircraft and its normal traffic patterns, he or she is more likely to leap quickly to a decision about the aircraft's identity - they may have seen the same type of aircraft from the same angle many times.

Some spotters will note the markings, a national insignia or [[airline]] livery or logo perhaps, a squadron badge or code letters in the case of a military craft. Published manuals allow more information to be deduced, such as the delivery date or the manufacturer's construction number. [[Camouflage]] markings differ, depending on the surroundings in which that aircraft is expected to operate.

[[image:aircraft.spotting.srilankan.arp.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Spotters enjoying the landing of a SriLankan Airlines Airbus A340 at [[London Heathrow Airport]].]]

Ancillary activities might include listening-in to air traffic transmissions (where that is legal), liaising with other &quot;spotters&quot; to clear up uncertainties as to what aircraft have been seen at specific times or in particular places, and the drawing, painting, filming, tape-recording or photographing of aircraft. 

The more enthusiastic hobbyists might travel great distances in order to visit a different airport fom their usual one, to see an unusual aircraft or to view the remains of aircraft withdrawn from use. Some such &quot;wrecks and relics&quot; may eventually be placed in the care of museums - or perhaps be cannibalised in order to repair a similar aircraft already preserved. Some spotters may go on to work in the aviation industry or air traffic control service.

During [[World War II|WWII]] and the subsequent [[Cold War]] some countries encouraged their citizens to become &quot;plane spotters&quot; in an &quot;observation corps&quot; or similar public body for reasons of public security. Britain had the [[Royal Observer Corps]] which operated between 1925 and 1995.

Some spotters are quite competitive and may get a thrill from seeing, in due course, all the planes of a particular type ever built (or existing at that date). Spotters are generally well-aware of the hazards facing aviators and will stay alert when near active aerodromes, taking care not to interfere with aircraft or cause anxiety to their owners or users.
 
[[Image:tornado.za463.arp.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The large tail of the RAF Tornado makes identifying the aircraft easy]]

Many airfields in Australasia, Europe and North America recognise the public's interest in aviation as something to be encouraged and provide viewing areas in safe locations. Many organised [[airshow]]s draw large crowds and some raise funds for charitable causes such as [[museum]]s, organisations restoring historic planes, or bodies that assist injured aircrew or the dependents of Armed Forces' personnel. Some shows have a more commercial motive, and some aircraft photographers can make a profit from their hobby. The World Wide Web has provided a new outlet for some of their photographs and assists all spotters in letting each other know what is flying where. 


See [[bus spotting]], [[train spotting]], [[birding]], and [[butterfly watching]] for examples of similar hobbies.

      <comment>/* Critical views */ Removing self promotion.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Generally speaking, '''advertising''' is the promotion of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]], [[service]]s, companies and ideas, usually by an identified [[sponsor]]. [[Marketing|Marketers]] see advertising as part of an overall promotional strategy. Other components of the promotional mix include [[publicity]], [[public relations]], [[sales|personal selling]] and [[sales promotion]].
[[Image:Ad Encyclopaedia-Britannica 05-1913.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A print advertisement from a 1913 issue of [[National Geographic]]]]

==History==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:12th street Wellner Motors(enhanced).jpg|right|thumb|250px|Advertisements painted on the side of buildings were common in the early-20th century U.S. This instance, now faded from lack of upkeep, is an example of a '''ghost ad'''.]] --&gt;

In ancient times the most common form of advertising was &quot;[[word of mouth]]&quot;. However, commercial messages and [[election campaign]] displays were found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]]. [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] used [[papyrus]] to create sales messages and wall posters. Lost-and-found advertising on papyrus was common in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Roman Empire|Rome]]. As printing developed in the [[15th century|15th]] and [[16th century]], advertising expanded to include handbills. In the [[17th century]] advertisements started to appear in weekly [[newspaper]]s in England. 

These early print ads were used mainly to promote books (which were increasingly affordable) and [[medicine]]s (which were increasingly sought after as [[disease]] ravaged Europe). [[Quackery|Quack ads]] became a problem, which ushered in [[Advertising regulation|regulation of advertising]] content.

As the economy was expanding during the [[19th century]], the need for advertising grew at the same pace. In [[United States|America]], the [[classified ad]]s became popular, filling pages of newspapers with small print messages promoting all kinds of goods. The success of this advertising format led to the growth of mail-order advertising. In [[1843]] the first [[advertising agency]] was established by [[Volney Palmer]] in [[Philadelphia]]. At first the agencies were just brokers for ad space in newspapers, but by the [[20th century]], advertising agencies started to take over responsibility for the content as well.

The [[1960s]] saw advertising transform into a modern, more scientific approach in which creativity was allowed to shine, producing unexpected messages that made advertisements interesting to read. The [[Volkswagen]] ad campaign featuring such headlines as &quot;Think Small&quot; and &quot;Lemon&quot; ushered in the era of modern advertising by promoting a &quot;position&quot; or &quot;unique selling proposition&quot; designed to associate each brand with a specific idea in the reader or viewer's mind. 

Today, advertising is evolving even further, with &quot;[[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]&quot; promotions that involve unusual approaches such as staged encounters in public places, giveaways of products such as cars that are covered with brand messages, and interactive advertising where the viewer can respond to become part of the advertising message.

==Media ==
[[Image:Advertisingman.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One effective advertising method is to pay people to hold signs in public places, such as the [http://money.guardian.co.uk/work/story/0,1456,1643687,00.html 'board guy'] pictured above]]
[[Image:Pedapodviews.jpg|thumb|right|Transit advertising is combined with experiential marketing using pedapods in Australia]]
Commercial advertising [[mass media|media]] can include [[Billboard (advertising)|billboard]]s ([[outdoor advertising]]), [[street furniture components]], printed [[flyer]]s, [[radio]], [[film|cinema]] and [[television]] ads, [[web banner]]s, web [[popups]], [[skywriting]], [[bus stop]] benches, [[magazine]]s, [[newspaper]]s, [[town crier]]s, [[side of a bus|sides of buses]], [[taxicab]] doors and roof mounts, [[industrial musical|musical stage shows]], [[metro|subway]] platforms and trains, elastic bands on disposable [[diapers]], stickers on apples in [[supermarket]]s, the opening section of [[Streaming media|streaming]] audio and video, and the backs of event tickets and supermarket receipts. Any place an &quot;identified&quot; sponsor pays to deliver their message through a [[medium]] is advertising.  

Covert advertising embedded in other entertainment media is known as [[product placement]]. 
A more recent version of this is advertising in [[film]], by having a main character use an item or other of a definite [[brand]] - an example is in the movie ''[[Minority Report]]'', where [[Tom Cruise]]'s character owns a computer with the ''[[Nokia]]'' logo clearly written in the top corner, or his watch engraved with the ''[[Bulgari]]'' logo.

The [[television commercial|TV commercial]] is generally considered the most effective mass-market advertising format and this is reflected by the high prices TV networks charge for commercial [[airtime]] during popular TV events. The annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football]] game in the [[United States]] is known as much for its commercial advertisements as for the game itself, and the average cost of a single thirty-second TV spot during this game has reached $2.5 million (as of [[2006]]).

Increasingly, other mediums such as those discussed below are overtaking television due to a shift towards consumer's usage of the Internet as well as devices such as [[TiVo]].

Advertising on the [[World Wide Web]] is a recent phenomenon. Prices of Web-based advertising space are dependent on the &quot;relevance&quot; of the surrounding web content and the traffic that the website receives.

[[E-mail]] advertising is another recent phenomenon. Unsolicited bulk E-mail advertising is known as &quot;[[spamming|spam]]&quot;.  

Some [[types of companies|companies]] have proposed to place messages or [[corporate logo]]s on the side of booster [[rocket]]s and the [[International Space Station]]. [[Controversy]] exists on the effectiveness of [[subliminal message|subliminal advertising]] (see [[mind control]]), and the pervasiveness of mass messages (see [[propaganda]]). 

Unpaid advertising (also called [[word of mouth]] advertising), can provide good exposure at minimal cost. Personal recommendations (&quot;bring a friend&quot;, &quot;sell it by zealot&quot;), spreading buzz, or achieving the feat of equating a [[brand]] with a common noun (&quot;[[Xerox]]&quot; = &quot;[[photocopier]]&quot;, &quot;[[Kleenex]]&quot; = &quot;[[Facial tissue|tissue]]&quot; , &quot;[[Scotch Tape]]&quot; = &quot;[[Adhesive_tape|Clear Tape]]&quot;, &quot;[[Band-aid]]&quot; = 
&quot;[[bandage]]&quot; , &quot;[[Apple iPod |iPod]]&quot; = &quot;[[MP3_Player|MP3 Player]]&quot; ) -- these must provide the stuff of fantasy to the holder of an advertising budget.

The most common method for measuring the impact of mass media advertising is the use of the rating point (rp) or the more accurate target rating point (trp). These two measures refer to the percentage of the universe of the existing base of audience members that can be reached by the use of each media outlet in a particular moment in time. The difference between the two is that the rating point refers to the percentage to the entire universe while the target rating point refers to the percentage to a particular segment or target. This becomes very useful when focusing advertising efforts on a particular group of people. For example, think of an advertising campaign targeting a female audience aged 25 to 45. While the overall rating of a TV show might be well over 10 rating points it might very well happen that the same show in the same moment of time is generating only 2.5 trps (being the target: women 25-45). This would mean that while the show has a large universe of viewers it is not necessarily reaching a large universe of women in the ages of 25 to 45 making it a less desirable location to place an ad for an advertiser looking for this particular demographic.

==Impact==
{{sect-stub}}

The impact of advertising has been a matter of considerable debate and many different claims have been made in different contexts.  During debates about the banning of cigarette adervertising, a common claim from cigarette manufacturers was that cigarette advertising does not encourage people to smoke who would not otherwise{{ref|uk-parl-BAT}}.  The (eventually successful) opponents of advertising, on the other hand, claim that advertising does in fact increase consumption{{ref|ash}}.  

According to many media sources, the past experience and state of mind of the person subjected to advertising may determine the impact that advertising has.  Children under the age of four may be unable to distinguish advertising from other television programs, whilst the ability to determine the truthfullness of the message may not be developed until the age of eight{{note|lawrence}}.



==Public service advertising==
The same advertising techniques used to promote commercial goods and services can be used to inform, educate and motivate the public about non-commercial issues, such as [[AIDS]], political ideology, energy conservation, religious recruitment, and deforestation.

Advertising, in its non-commercial guise, is a powerful educational tool capable of reaching and motivating large audiences. &quot;Advertising justifies its existence when used in the public interest - it is much too powerful a tool to use solely for commercial purposes.&quot; - Attributed to Howard Gossage by [[David Ogilvy]]

[[Public service advertising]], [[non-commercial advertising]], public interest advertising, cause  marketing, and social marketing are different terms for (or aspects of) the use of sophisticated advertising and marketing communications techniques (generally associated with commercial enterprise) on behalf of non-commercial, public interest issues and initiatives.

In the [[United States]], the granting of television and radio licenses by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] is contingent upon the station broadcasting a certain amount of public service advertising.

Public service advertising reached its height during World Wars I and II under the direction of several U.S. government agencies.

==Social impact==
=== Regulation ===
{{main|Advertising regulation}}

There have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating the content and the reach of advertising. Some examples are the ban on television [[tobacco advertising]] imposed in many countries, and the total ban on advertising to children under twelve imposed by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] government in 1991. Though that regulation continues in effect for broadcasts originating within the country, it has been weakened by the [[European Court of Justice]], which has found that Sweden was obliged to accept whatever programming was targeted at it from neighbouring countries or via satellite. 

In Europe and elsewhere there is a vigorous debate on whether and how much advertising to children should be regulated. This debate was exacerbated by a report released by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in February 2004 which suggested that food advertising targeting children was an important factor in the epidemic of childhood [[obesity]] raging across the United States.

In many countries - namely New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, and many European contries- the advertising industry operates a system of self-regulation. Advertisers, advertising agencies and the media agree on a code of advertising standards that they attempt to uphold. The general aim of such codes is to ensure that any advertising is 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'. Some self-regulatory organisations are funded by the industry, but remain independent, with the intent of upholding the standards or codes (like the [[Advertising Standards Authority|ASA]] in the UK).

===Critiques of the medium===
As advertising and marketing efforts become increasingly ubiquitous in modern Western societies, the industry has come under criticism of groups such as [[AdBusters]] via [[culture jamming]] which criticizes the media and [[consumerism]] using advertising's own techniques. The industry is accused of being one of the engines powering a convoluted [[economic]] [[mass production]] system which promotes [[consumption]]. Some advertising campaigns have also been criticized as inadvertently or even intentionally promoting [[sexism]], [[racism]], and [[ageism]]. Such criticisms have raised questions about whether this medium is creating or reflecting cultural trends. At very least, advertising often reinforces [[stereotype]]s by drawing on recognizable &quot;types&quot; in order to tell stories in a single image or 30 second time frame. Recognizing the social impact of advertising, [[MediaWatch]], a non-profit women's organization, works to educate consumers about how they can register their concerns with advertisers and regulators. It has developed educational materials for use in schools. The award-winning book, Made You Look - How Advertising Works and Why You Should Know , by former MediaWatch president Shari Graydon, provides context for these issues for young readers. 

[[public interest|Public]] [[interest group]]s and free thinkers are increasingly suggesting that access to the mental space targeted by advertisers should be taxed, in that at the present moment that space is being [[externality|freely taken advantage of]] by advertisers with no compensation paid to the members of the public who are thus being intruded upon. This kind of tax would be a [[Pigovian tax]] in that it would act to reduce what is now increasingly seen as a public [[nuisance]]. Efforts to that end are gathering momentum, with [[Arkansas]] and [[Maine]] considering bills to implement such taxation. [[Florida]] enacted such a tax in [[1987]] but was forced to repeal it after six months, as a result of a concerted effort by national commercial interests, which withdrew planned conventions, causing major losses to the tourism industry, and cancelled advertising, causing a loss of 12 million dollars to the broadcast industry alone.

===Public perception of the medium===
Over the years, the public perception of advertising has become very negative. It is seen as a medium that inherently promotes a lie, based on the purpose of the advertisement - to encourage the target audience to submit to a cause or a belief, and act on it to the advertising party's benefit and consequently the target's disadvantage. They are either perceived as directly lying (stating opinions or untruths directly as facts), lying by omission (usually terms or conditions unfavorable to the customer), portraying a product or service in a light that does not reflect reality or even making up realities where their product has a new rol. It is this increased awareness of the intention of advertising, as well as advertising regulations that have increased the challenges that marketers face.

===Effects on communication media===
Another effect of advertising is to modify the nature of the communication media where it is shown. The most clear example is television. Channels that get most of their revenues from publicity try to make their medium a good place for communicating ads. That means trying to make the public stay for long times and in a mental state that will make spectators not to switch the channel through the ads. Programs that are low in mental stimulus and require light concentration and are varied are best for long sitting times and make for easier emotional jumps to ads, that can become more entretaining than regular shows.
A simple way to understand the objectives in [[television programming]] is to compare contents from channels paid and chosen by the viewer or channels that get their income mainly from advertisements.

==Future==
With the dawn of the Internet have come many new advertising opportunities.  Popup, Flash, banner, and email advertisements (the last often being a form of spam) abound.  Recently, the advertising community has attempted to make the adverts themselves desirable to the public. In one example, [[Cadillac]] chose to advertise in the movie '[[The Matrix Reloaded]]', which as a result contained many scenes in which Cadillac cars were used.

Each year, greater sums are paid to obtain a commercial spot during the [[Super Bowl]].  Companies attempt to make these commercials sufficiently entertaining that members of the public will actually want to watch them.  

Particularly since the rise of &quot;entertaining&quot; advertising, some people may like an advert enough that they wish to watch it later or show a friend.  In general, the advertising community has not yet made this easy, although some  have used the Internet to widely distribute their adverts to anyone wishing to see or hear them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''AI-complete''' is, by analogy to [[NP-complete]]ness in complexity theory, a term first coined by Fanya S. Montalvo to indicate that the difficulty of a computational problem is equivalent to solving the central [[Artificial Intelligence]] problem, in other words, making computers as intelligent as people. Note that unlike NP-completeness, this term is typically used informally.

To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it won't be solved by a simple algorithm, such as those used in [[ELIZA]].  Such problems are hypothesised to include:

*[[Computer vision]]
*[[Natural language understanding]]
*Passing the [[Turing Test]]

These problems are easy for humans to do (in fact, some are described directly in terms of imitating humans), and all, at their core, are about representing complex relationships between a large number of human concepts.  Some systems can solve very simple restricted versions of these problems, but none can solve them in their full generality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Archaeoastronomy''' (also spelled '''Archeoastronomy''') is the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence. Archaeoastronomy examines archaeological sites for evidence of astronomy in remote cultures, and anthropological and ethnohistorical evidence for evidence of astronomical practices in living cultures. The study of the astronomies of living traditional cultures is sometimes called Ethnoastronomy. Archaeoastronomy also focuses on modern astronomy, employing historical records of early astronomical observations to study past astronomical events, and employing astronomical data to clarify the historical record.

In the study of solar, lunar, and stellar alignments of monuments, numerous claims have been made that the [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]], such as [[Nabta Playa]], [[Stonehenge]] and [[New Grange]], represent &quot;ancient observatories,&quot; but the extent and nature of their use in that regard needs careful definition. Certainly, they are aligned with particular significance to the solstitial points. 

The early development of this aspect of archaeoastronomy was influenced by [[Alexander Thom|Alexander Thom's]] studies of megalithic monuments of Britain, published in ''[[Megalithic sites in Britain]]'' (Oxford, 1967). Thom employed detailed surveys and statistical methods to investigate the calendric and astronomical functions of numerous Neolithic monuments. He claimed that these monuments incorporate alignments to points on the horizon where the sun and moon rise and set at seasonal extremes like midsummer, midwinter and the equinoxes. In addition to his work on Neolithic astronomy, he also proposed the [[megalithic yard]] as a standardized unit of measure.  Although his work greatly influenced the development of archaeoastronomy, many of his conclusions (especially those implying highly precise observations) have been widely questioned.

Anthropological and ethnohistorical methods have been used to study astronomies in a wide range of cultures.  Typical studies have examined the astronomical and calendric practices of the [[Hopi]] and [[Zuni]] of the Southwestern United States; the astronomy and cosmology of the Andean villagers of Misminay; the calendrical and divinatory practices of modern [[Maya]] priests, and the ambiguous [[lunar calendar]] of the [[Mursi]] of southwestern Ethiopia.

Archaeoastronomy has also considered the extensive records of ancient China for references to &quot;guest stars&quot;. &quot;Guest stars,&quot; or star-like objects which appeared in the [[night sky]], were of great interest to the observers of ancient China and were often dutifully recorded. These events have been associated with many transitory phenomena, such as [[comet]]s and, particularly, [[supernova|supernovae]]. Besides the insights such records provide into the significance of celestial phenomena in ancient cultures, they have also been found useful by modern astronomers.

'''Andrzej Sapkowski''', born [[June 21]], [[1948]] in [[Łódź]], is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Fantasy|fantasy]] writer. Sapkowski studied economics and worked as a businessman before  becoming well known as a writer. His first [[short story]], ''[[The Hexer]] ''(''Wiedźmin''), was published in ''[[Fantastyka]]'', Poland's leading fantasy literary magazine, in 1986 and garnered enormous critical success. Sapkowski has created a cycle of tales based on the world of ''The Hexer'', comprising three collections of short stories and five [[novel]]s. This cycle and his many other books have made him one of the most well-known fantasy authors in Poland [[1990s]].

The main character of ''[[The Hexer]]'' (alternative translation: ''[[The Witcher]]'') is Geralt, a mutant assassin who has been trained from childhood to hunt down and destroy monsters and other vermin. Geralt moves in an ambiguous moral universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At once cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to [[Raymond Chandler]]'s signature character [[Philip Marlowe]]. The world in which these adventures take place owes much to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], while also heavily influenced by Polish history and Slavic mythology.

Sapkowski has won five [[Zajdel Award]]s, including three for the short stories &quot;Mniejsze zło&quot; (''Smaller Evil'') ([[1990]]), &quot;Miecz przeznaczenia&quot; (''Sword of destiny'') ([[1992]]) and &quot;W leju po bombie&quot; (''In a bomb hole'') ([[1993]]), and two for the novels &quot;Krew elfów&quot; (''Elven blood'') ([[1994]]) and &quot;Narrenturm&quot; ([[2002]]). 

In 1997, Sapkowski won the prestigious Polityka Passport award, which the Polish newsweekly Polityka grants to Polish artists that have strong prospects for international success.

In 2001, a [[The Hexer#Film|film]] based on the ''Hexer'' cycle was released in Poland and internationally, titled ''Wiedźmin'' (''The Hexer''),  but both have been critical and box office failures. 

Sapkowski's books have been translated into Czech, Russian, Lithuanian, German, Spanish, French, Slovakian and Portuguese. English translation of ''The Last Wish'' short story collection is going to be published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]] in [[2006]].

Polish game publisher CD Projekt is also working on a role-playing PC game based on this universe. Called The Witcher, it's currently due for release in 2006.

An '''ammeter''' is a [[measuring instrument]] used to measure the flow of [[electric current]] in a [[Electric circuit|circuit]].  Electric currents are measured in [[ampere]]s, hence the name. The word &quot;ammeter&quot; is commonly misspelled or mispronounced as &quot;ampmeter&quot; by some.

The earliest design is the D'Arsonval [[galvanometer]].  It uses [[magnetism|magnetic]] deflection, where current passing through a coil causes the coil to move in a [[magnetic field]].  The [[voltage]] drop across the coil is kept to a minimum to minimize resistance in any circuit into which the meter is inserted.

A galvanometer can burn out if its tiny, delicate coil overheats.  To measure larger currents, a [[resistor]] called a [[Ammeter shunt|''shunt'']] is placed in [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]] with the coil.  Most of the current flows through the shunt, and only a small fraction flows through the meter.  With this solution, arbitrarily large currents can be measured with a single meter. Traditionally, the meter used with a shunt reaches full-scale deflection when a voltage of 50mV is placed across its coil, so shunts are typically designed to produce a voltage drop of 50mV when carrying their full rated current.

Cruder ammeters simply use a moving piece of [[iron]] (or a magnet) that is acted-upon by the electromagnetic force of fixed coil of (usually heavy [[Wire gauge|gauge]] wire. At very high current ratings, such an ammeter can actually just clamp on to an existing conductor (where the conductor acts as a single-turn coil); this later example is sometimes used in automotive applications where it clamps-on to the main [[car battery|battery]] wire to show the charging and discharging of the battery.

More modern ammeter designs use an [[analog to digital converter]] to measure the voltage across the shunt resistor. The ADC is read by a microcomputer that performs the calculations to display the current through the resistor.

One problem with the use of an ammeter is the need for the meter to be inserted into the circuit and become part of it.  In AC circuits, an inductive coupling adapter converts the magnetic field around a [[Conductor (material)|conductor]] into a small AC current that can be easily read by a meter. See [[clamp meter]]. In a similar way, accurate DC non-contact ammeters have been constructed using [[Hall effect]] magnetic field sensors.

'''Associazione Calcio Milan''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club. Based in [[Milan]], [[Lombardy]], they play in red-and-black stripes and black shorts ( the same as [[Bohemian F.C.]] ), giving them the nickname ''rossoneri'' (&quot;red-blacks&quot;). One of the most successful [[club]]s in the world, they have won the prestigious [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] 6 times (second only to [[Real Madrid]]), [[Serie A]] 17 times (only rivals [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] have more [[Scudetto|Scudetti]]) and [[Coppa Italia]] five times. It is also one of the most supported football clubs in the world.


==History==
The club was founded in 1899 as the ''Milan Cricket and Football Club'' by [[Alfred Edwards]] and [[Herbert Kilpin]], [[United Kingdom|British]] expatriates. In honour of its origins, the club has retained the [[English language|English]] [[spelling]] of its [[city|city's]] name, instead of changing it to the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Milano''; it should be noted that the current Italian [[pronunciation]] is actually ''MEE-lahn''.

Historically, AC Milan (usually referred to as &quot;Mìlan&quot; in Italy) was supported by the city's [[working class|working classes]] and [[trade union|trade unionists]], while Inter was mainly supported by the more prosperous. However, in recent years, the clubs have seen a significant reversal in supporter bases, since Milan is now owned by media magnate and current conservative Prime Minister of Italy [[Silvio Berlusconi]], while Inter is now owned by a centre-left [[petroleum|oil]] [[businessman]], [[Massimo Moratti]].

Perhaps AC Milan's greatest period of success was in the late 1980s and early 1990s, triumphing in the European Champions League in 1989, 1990 and 1994 as well as a brace of domestic league titles and various other prizes.  During this time, the rossoneri came to be known as 'Gli Invicibili' the Invincibles - as proven by an unprecedented 58 match run with no defeats; their 1992 Scudetto triumph came without a single defeat - to this day a feat which has not been repeated.  The Invincibili team had the likes of [[Franco Baresi]] and [[Paolo Maldini]] commanding possibly one of the best defences in history alongside the Dutch trio of [[Ruud Gullit]], [[Frank Rijkaard]] and [[Marco Van Basten]] rounding out the attack.  AC Milan was crowned European champions in 1969 when [[Cesare Maldini]], current skipper, Paolo's father was in the side.  More recently, AC Milan have attempted to recapture their glory days with two domestic titles in 1999 and 2004 and a sixth Champions League trophy in 2003.  In 2005, AC Milan let a 3-0 lead in their Champions League Final slip to a 3-3 draw before losing on penalties against [[FC Liverpool]] of England.  This was the first time that AC Milan had lost in a European Final while playing in their away strip (all-white).

==Stadium==
The team's current [[stadium]] is the 85,700 seater Giuseppe Meazza, also known as the [[San Siro]]. The stadium is shared with [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Internazionale]] (also known as &quot;Inter&quot;), the other major football club in Milan. AC Milan supporters use &quot;San Siro&quot; to refer to the stadium because [[Giuseppe Meazza|Meazza]] was a star player for Inter.

On [[19 December]] [[2005]], Milan Vice-President/CEO, [[Adriano Galliani]] announced that the team is seriously working to move out from San Siro. He said that Milan's new stadium will be largely based on Schalke Arena and following the standards of football stadia in America, Germany, and Spain. Most likely it will be a stadium for football purpose only (without the athletic tracks). The new stadium's name will be given to the sponsors.

'''Amanda Hesser''' is a chef, cookbook author and food reporter. She is currently the editor for ''[[The New York Times]]'' style magazine, ''T Living''.

She was born in [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]], [[Pennsylvania]]. After graduating from [[Bentley College]] in 1993, her interest in cooking sent her to work in New York, and eventually to study in Europe after receiving the Les Dames d'Escoffier scholarship.  Her studies took her to Germany, Switzerland, Rome, and eventually France.

During her time in France, Hesser cooked at L'Essentiel in the Haute Savoie under Chef Jean-Michel Bouvier as well as the Château du Feÿ in Burgundy.  While apprenticing as a personal cook to the family of the founder, Anne Willan, Hesser earned a Graduate Diplôme from the École de Cuisine La Varenne.  It was during this time in France that Hesser's writings started appearing in books and newspapers, including ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

Hesser now lives in [[New York City]].  Her first book, released in 1999, is titled ''The Cook and The Gardner''.

Hesser also wrote a book entitled &quot;Cooking for Mr. Latte,&quot; which was published in 2003.

An '''anxiolytic''' is any [[Medication|drug]] or therapy used in the treatment of [[anxiety disorder]]s. Different [[antidepressant]]s, [[azapirone]]s, [[benzodiazepine]]s, and non-cardioselective [[beta-receptor blocker]]s can be prescribed. For [[somatic]] symptoms, [[propranolol]] and [[oxprenolol]] can be used. 

Many of the [[Tricyclic antidepressant|tri]]/[[tetracyclic antidepressant]]s currently marketed (e.g. [[doxepin]], [[trimipramine]], [[amitriptyline]], [[clomipramine]]) show effective anxiolytic properties independent from their antidepressant activity. [[Venlafaxine]] is a relatively new drug with dual action (reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine) and proven efficiacy. Additionally, it may have a shorter latent period than other medications. [[SSRI]]s such as [[Fluoxetine]] and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibitor]]s such as [[moclobemide]] or [[phenelzine]] exert anxiolytic activity, but often only after a latent period of several weeks. The initial SSRI dose should be particular low &amp;ndash; for instance, Fluoxetine or Paroxetin 10mg daily &amp;ndash; because higher doses may worsen anxiety. The dose may subsequently be increased gradually to 40mg (Fluoxetine) or 50mg (Paroxetin) daily. Most of the SSRI and MAO inhibitors aditionally benefit the disabling symptoms of [[agoraphobia]], often noted to occur together with anxiety disorders. '''MAO inhibitors and SSRIs must never be given together.''' 

[[Neuroleptic]]s of the different classes may also be effective as anxiolytics, but this use is usually discouraged because of the high incidence of side effects encountered, especially early and late extrapyramidal ones, which could be irreversible.

[[Azapirone]]s, such as [[buspirone]], are most commonly prescribed. They are chemically and pharmacologically quite different from most of the other anxiolytics and the adverse effects of dependence, sedation and psychomotor impairment are noticeably less than with [[benzodiazepine]]s.

Benzodiazepines are prescribed for short-term relief (the [[FDA]] recommends a maximum of 8 months for most benzodiazepines) of severe and disabling anxiety. Common medications are [[diazepam]] (Valium&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[alprazolam]] (Xanax&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;). Benzodiazepines may also be indicated to cover the latent periods associated with SSRIs, MAO inhibitors and azapirones. They are used to treat a wide variety of conditions and symptoms and are usually a first choice when short-term [[Central nervous system|CNS]] [[sedation]] is needed. Longer term uses include severe anxiety and [[psychosis]]. There is a risk of [[withdrawal]] symptoms and rebound syndrome after only a few weeks. There is also the added problem of the accumulation of drug [[metabolite]]s and adverse effects.

[[Barbiturate]]s and [[meprobamate]] exert an anxiolytic effect linked to the sedation they cause. The risk of abuse and addiction is high. Many experts consider these drugs as obsolete for treating anxiety, although they may be valuable for the short term treatment of severe insomnia.

Certain herbs, such as [[St. John's Wort]] and [[Kava]] (Kava Kava), have been used as anxiolytics, but limited reliable evidence is available for their efficacy. In Europe, the root of the [[Valerian (plant)|valerian]] is also popular as an anxiolytic.

It should be noted that [[psychotherapy]] (e.g. cognitive or behavior therapy) is in most cases very useful to assist [[pharmacotherapy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term '''antipsychotic''' is applied to a group of [[Medication|drug]]s used to treat [[psychosis]]. Common conditions with which antipsychotics might be used include [[schizophrenia]], [[mania]] and [[delusional disorder]], although antipsychotics might be used to counter psychosis associated with a wide range of other diagnoses. Antipsychotics also have some effects as [[mood stabilizer]]s, leading to their frequent use in treating [[mood disorder]] (particularly [[bipolar disorder]]) even when no signs of psychosis are present. Some antipsychotics ([[haloperidol]], [[pimozide]]) are used to treat [[Tourette's Syndrome]].

These drugs are also referred to as '''neuroleptic drugs''', or simply '''neuroleptics'''. The word neuroleptic is derieved from Greek. 'Neuro' refers to the nerves and 'lept' means 'to take hold of'. Thus the word means 'taking hold of one's nerves' which implies their role in mood stabilization.

There are currently two main types of antipsychotics in use, the [[typical antipsychotic]]s and [[atypical antipsychotic]]s. A new class of antipsychotic drugs has recently been discovered, known as [[partial dopamine agonist]]s. Clinical development has progressed rapidly on partial dopamine agonists, and one drug in this class ([[aripiprazole]]) has already been approved by the [[FDA]]. Although the underlying mechanism of this new class is different from all previous typical and atypical antipsychotics, partial dopamine agonists are often categorized as atypicals.

Typical antipsychotics are sometimes referred to as '''major tranquilizers''', because some of them can tranquilise and sedate. This term is increasingly disused because many newer antipsychotics do not have strong sedating properties and the terminology implies a connection with [[benzodiazepine]]s, whereas none exists.

== Common antipsychotic drugs ==
Commonly used antipsychotic medications are listed below by drug group. Trade names appear in brackets.

*[[Typical antipsychotic]]s:
** [[Phenothiazines]]:
*** [[Chlorpromazine]] (Thorazine&amp;reg;)
*** [[Fluphenazine]] (Prolixin&amp;reg;) - Available in decanoate (long acting) form
*** [[Perphenazine]] (Trilafon&amp;reg;)
*** [[Prochlorperazine]] (Compazine&amp;reg;)
*** [[Thioridazine]] (Mellaril&amp;reg;)
*** [[Trifluoperazine]] (Stelazine&amp;reg;)
** [[Haloperidol]] (Haldol&amp;reg;)- Available in decanoate (long acting) form
** [[Pimozide]] (Orap&amp;reg;) - Used to treat [[Tourette's Syndrome]]

* [[Atypical antipsychotic]]s:
** [[Clozapine]] (Clozaril&amp;reg;)- Requires weekly to every two week [[complete blood count|CBC (FBC)]] due to risk of [[agranulocytosis]] (severe decrease of  [[white blood cells]]).
** [[Olanzapine]] (Zyprexa&amp;reg;) - Used to treate psychotic disorders including acute manic episodes and maintenance of bipolar disorder.  Dosing 2.5 mg to 20 mg per day.  Comes in a form that quickly dissovles in the mouth (Zyprexa Zydis).  May cause appetite increase, weight gain and altered glucose metabolism leading to an increased risk of diabetes mellitus.
** [[Risperidone]] (Risperdal&amp;reg;) - Dosing 0.25 - 6 mg per day and is titrated upward; divided dosing is recommended until initial titration is completed at which time the drug can be administered once daily. Available in long-acting form (Risperdal Consta that is administered every 2 weeks; usual dose is 25 mg.).  Comes in a form that quickly dissovles in the mouth (Risperdal M-Tab)
** [[Quetiapine]] (Seroquel&amp;reg;)- Also used to treat bipolar disorders; helps with sleep (if used for sleep and not effective at 200 mg, it is not going to be effective in this regard)  Dosing 25 mg up to 800 mg maximum.  Usually see smaller doses during the day and larger dose at bedtime.
** [[Ziprasidone]] (Geodon&amp;reg;) -  Now approved to treat bipolar disorder.  Dosing 20 mg twice daily initially up to 80 mg twice daily.  Prolonged [[QT interval]] a concern; watch closely with patients who have heart disease; when used with other drugs that prolong QT interval potentially life-threatening.

* [[Partial dopamine agonist]]s:
** [[Aripiprazole]] (Abilify) - Newest atypical antipsychotic; dosing 5 mg up to maximum of 30 mg has been used.  Mechanism of action is thought to reduce susceptibility to metabolic symptoms seen in some other atypical antipsychotics.

Symbyax - (combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine used in the treatment of bipolar depression.)

* [[Tetrabenazine]] (Nitoman&amp;reg; in Canada and Xenazine&amp;reg; in New Zealand and some parts of Europe) is similar in function to antipsychotic drugs, though isn't generally considered an antipsychotic itself.  This is likely due to its main usefulness being the treatment of hyperkinetic [[movement disorder]]s such as [[Huntington's Disease]] and [[Tourette's Syndrome]], rather than for conditions such as [[schizophrenia]].  Also, rather than having the potential to cause [[tardive dyskinesia]] that most antipsychotics have, tetrabenazine can actually be an effective ''treatment'' for the condition.

The typical antipsychotic drugs are now out of [[patent]] meaning any pharmaceutical company is legally allowed to produce cheap [[generic drug|generic]] versions of these medications. Whilst this makes them a great deal cheaper than the atypical drugs which are still in patent, atypical drugs are preferred as a first line treatment due to the fact that they are believed to have fewer side effects and seem to have additional benefits for the 'negative symptoms' of [[schizophrenia]], a typical condition for which they might be prescribed.  A recent multi-site, [[NIMH]] study published in 2005 comparing the atypicals to perphenazine found no greater efficacy for the atypicals, which had a side effect profile that was equal to or worse than the older drug.

== Drug action and effectiveness ==

All antipsychotic drugs tend to block the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[receptors]] in the [[dopamine]] pathways in the [[brain]], so the normal effect of dopamine release in the relevant [[synapse]]s is reduced.

It is the blockade of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] of the [[brain]] which is thought to produce the intended antipsychotic effect. 

Typical antipsychotics are not particularly selective and also block the same receptors in the [[mesocortical pathway]], [[tuberoinfundibular pathway]] and the [[nigrostriatal pathway]]. Blocking D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in these other pathways is thought to produce some of the unwanted [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] that the typical antipsychotics can produce (see below).

Atypical antipsychotic drugs have a similar blocking effect on D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors but seem to be a little more selective, targeting the intended pathway to a larger degree than the others. They also block or partially block [[serotonin]] receptors (particularly 5HT&lt;sub&gt;2A,C&lt;/sub&gt; and 5HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors).

This combination of effects on both dopamine and serotonin receptors might be why atypical antipsychotic drugs tend to have fewer side effects than typicals and have a seemingly additional effect on the 'negative symptoms' of schizophrenia.

Anti-psychotics can be classified on a spectrum of low potency to high potency, where potency refers to the ability of the drug to bind to dopamine receptors, and not to the effectiveness of the drug.  High potency antipsychotics such as [[haloperidol]] typically have doses of a few milligrams and cause less sleepiness and calming effects than low potency antipsychotics such as [[chlorpromazine]], which have dosages of several hundred milligrams.

There is generally a lag of a few days to a few weeks between the time the drug is started and the time that the medication begins to reduce psychosis.  Why this is so remains unclear.

Some people who become psychotic do not seem to respond to antipsychotic medication, despite studies showing that the drug is blocking the same number of receptors as in other people who do respond to the treatment.

A [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16172203&amp;query_hl=2 recent review], comparing the effectiveness of both typical and atypical antipsychotic medication, found little clinical advantage for atypical antipsychotics in reducing psychotic symptoms, although [[olanzapine]] was associated with more weight gain and less chance of discontinuation.

== Side effects ==
The range of interactions can produce different adverse effects including [[Extrapyramidal side-effect|extrapyramidal]] reactions, including acute [[dystonia]]s, [[akathisia]], rigidity and [[tremor]], [[tardive dyskinesia]], [[tachycardia]], [[hypotension]], [[impotence]], lethargy, [[seizure]]s, and [[hyperprolactinaemia]].

The atypical antipsychotics (especially [[olanzapine]]) seem to cause weight gain more commonly than the typical antipsychotics.  The well documented metabolic side effects associated with weight gain include diabetes that, not infrequently, can be life threatening.

[[clozapine|Clozapine]] also has a risk of inducing [[agranulocytosis]], a potentially dangerous reduction in the number of white blood cells in the body. Because of this risk, patients prescribed clozapine may need to have regular blood checks to catch the condition early if it does occur, so the patient is in no danger.

One of the more serious of these side effects is [[tardive dyskinesia]], in which the sufferer may show repetitive, involuntary, purposeless movements often of the lips, face, legs or torso. (Photos and video can be seen [http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/120 here]). It is believed that there is a greater risk of developing tardive dyskinesia with the older, typical antipsychotic drugs, although the newer antipsychotics are now also known to cause this disorder.  It is believed by some that the risk of tardive dyskinesia can be reduced by combining the anti-psychotics with [[diphenhydramine]] or [[benztropine]], though this has not been established.  [[Central nervous system]] damage is also associated with irreversible [[tardive akathisia]] and [[tardive dementia]]. 

Another serious side effect is [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], in which the drugs appear to cause the temperature regulation centers to fail, resulting in a medical emergency as the patient's temperature suddenly increases to dangerous levels.

Another problematic side effect of antipsychotics is [[dysphoria]], meaning that it just makes the patient feel bad. This side-effect is a major problem for patients with schizophrenia in that it causes them to discontinue medication, and this produces a relapse of psychotic symptoms.

Whilst this may seem a daunting list, it must be noted that many people suffer few of the obvious side effects from taking antipsychotic medication. Some side effects, such as subtle cognitive problems, foot rocking, or drooling, in the case of akinesia go unnoticed. 

Other symptoms of akinesia of antipsychotics include deterioration of teeth due to a lack of saliva. These symptoms are hard to spot and are often dismissed.

== History and design ==
The original antipsychotic drugs were happened upon largely by chance and were tested empirically for their effectiveness.

The first antipsychotic was [[chlorpromazine]], which was developed as a surgical [[anesthetic]].  It was first used on psychiatric patients in the belief that it would have a calming effect. However, the drug soon appeared to reduce psychosis beyond this calming effect, and now some believe that it causes a reduction of psychosis unrelated to the sedating effect of the medication.  It was introduced for the treatment of psychosis during the period when [[lobotomy]] was a common treatment and was hailed as a &quot;cure&quot; for schizophrenia.  It was then touted to provide a &quot;chemical lobotomy,&quot; causing similar neurological effects without requiring surgery.

The newer atypical antipsychotics are supposedly [[rational drug design|rationally designed drugs]] in which a theoretical understanding of both the condition to be treated and the effect of certain molecules on the body is used to develop potential new drug candidates.

'''Archduke Charles of Austria, Duke of Teschen''' ([[de]]: ''Erzherzog Karl von Österreich, Herzog von Teschen'', also known as ''Karl von Österreich-Teschen'') ([[September 5]],[[1771]] &amp;ndash; [[April 30]], [[1847]]) was a son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1747 &amp;ndash; 1792) and his wife Maria Luisa of [[Spain]] (1745 &amp;ndash; 1792). He was also a younger brother of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Despite being epileptic, Charles achieved respect both as a commander and as a reformer of Austria's army.

==Youth and early career==
In a generous act by his father, Charles was adopted and raised in Vienna by his childless aunt [[Marie Christine of Austria]] and her husband [[Albert of Saxe-Teschen]]. His youth was spent in [[Tuscany]], at [[Vienna]] and in the Austrian Netherlands, where he began his career of military service in the war of the [[French Revolution]]. He commanded a brigade at the [[Battle of Jemappes]], and in the campaign of 1793 distinguished himself at the [[Battle of Aldenhoven|Action of Aldenhoven]] and the [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Battle of Neerwinden]]. In this year he became Statthalter in [[Belgium]] and received the army rank of lieutenant field marshal, which promotion was soon followed by that to Feldzeugmeister. In the remainder of the war in the [[Low Countries]] he held high commands, and he was present at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]].

In 1795 he served on the Rhine, and in the following year was entrusted with the chief control of all the Austrian forces on that river. His conduct of the operations against [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]] and [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]] in [[1796]] marked him out at once as one of the greatest generals in Europe. At first falling back carefully and avoiding a decision, he finally marched away, leaving a mere screen in front of Moreau. Falling upon Jourdan he beat him in the battles of [[Battle of Amberg (1796)|Amberg]] and [[Battle of Würzburg|Würzburg]], and drove him over the Rhine with great loss. He then turned upon Moreau's army, which he defeated and forced out of Germany.

==Napoleonic Wars==
[[Image:Archduke_Charles_Picture.jpg|thumb|300px|Victorious Archduke Charles of Austria during the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] (May 21-22, [[1809]])]]
In [[1797]] he was sent to arrest the victorious march of [[Napoleon I of France|General Bonaparte]] in [[Italy]], and he conducted the retreat of the over-matched Austrians with the highest skill. In the campaign of 1799 he was once more opposed to Jourdan, whom he defeated in the battles of [[Battle of Osterach|Osterach]] and [[Battle of Stockash (1800)|Stokasch]], following up his success by invading [[Switzerland]] and defeating [[André Masséna|Masséna]] in the [[First Battle of Zürich]], after which he re-entered Germany and drove the French once more over the Rhine.

Serving with distinction against [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in [[1796]], Charles then beat lesser opponents such as [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|General Jourdan]] and [[André Masséna|General Massena]] at the [[First Battle of Zurich]] June [[1799]]. 

Ill-health, however, forced him to retire to [[Bohemia]], whence he was soon recalled to undertake the task of checking Moreau's advance on Vienna. The result of the [[Battle of Hohenlinden]] had, however, foredoomed the attempt, and the archduke had to make the armistice of [[Steyr]]. His popularity was now such that the diet of Regensburg, which met in 1802, resolved to erect a statue in his honour and to give him the title of saviour of his country, but Charles refused both distinctions.

In the short and disastrous war of 1805 Archduke Charles commanded what was intended to be the main army in Italy, but events made Germany the decisive theatre of operations, and the defeats sustained on the [[Danube]] neutralized the success obtained by the archduke over Massena in the desperately fought [[Battle of Caldiero]]. With the conclusion of peace began his active work of army reorganization, which was first tested on the field in [[1809]]. As ''generalissimo'' of the army he had been made [[Generalfeldmarschall|field marshal]] some years before.

In 1806 Francis II (now Francis I of Austria) named the Archduke Charles Commander in Chief of the Austrian army as well as Head of the Council of War. Supported by the prestige of being the only general who had proved capable of defeating the French, he promptly initiated a far-reaching scheme of reform, which replaced the obsolete methods of the [[18th century]], the chief characteristics of the new order being the adoption of the nation in arms principle and of the French war organization and tactics. The new army was surprised in the process of transition by the war of 1809, in which Charles acted as commander in chief, yet even so it proved a far more formidable opponent than the old, and, against the now heterogeneous army of which Napoleon disposed it succumbed only after a desperate struggle.

Its initial successes were neutralized by the reverses of [[Battle of Abensberg|Abensberg]], [[Battle of Landshut|Landshut]] and [[Battle of Eckmuhl|Eckmuhl]] but, after the evacuation of Vienna, the archduke won the great [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] and soon afterwards fought the still more desperate [[Battle of Wagram]], at the close of which the Austrians were defeated but not routed. They had inflicted upon Napoleon a loss of over 50,000 men in the two battles. At the end of the campaign the archduke gave up all his military offices.

==Later life==
[[Image:archdukecharles2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Archduke Charles with family.]]
Charles spent the rest of his life in retirement, except for a short time in 1815 when he was governor of Mainz. In 1822 he succeeded to the duchy of Saxe-Teschen. Archduke Charles married, in 1815, Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg ([[1797]]&amp;ndash;[[1829]]). He had five sons, the eldest of whom, the [[Archduke Albert (1817-1895)|Archduke Albert]] became one of the most celebrated generals in Europe, and two daughters, the elder of which, Maria Theresa ([[1816]]&amp;ndash;[[1867]]) married Ferdinando II, King of the Two Sicilies. He died at Vienna on [[30 April]] [[1847]]. He is buried in tomb 122 in the [[Imperial Crypt Vaults#The New Vault|New Vault]] of the [[Imperial Crypt]] in Vienna. An equestrian statue was erected to his memory on the [[Heldenplatz]] in Vienna in [[1860]].

==Assessment of his achievements==
The caution which the archduke preached so earnestly in his strategical works, he displayed in practice only when the situation seemed to demand it, though his education certainly prejudiced him in favour of the defensive at all costs. He was at the same time capable of forming and executing the most daring offensive strategy, and his tactical skill in the handling of troops, whether in wide turning movements, as at Würzburg and Zürich, or in masses, as at Aspern and Wagram, was certainly equal to that of any leader of his time, with only a few exceptions.

His campaign of [[1796]] is considered almost faultless. That he sustained defeat in 1809 was due in part to the great numerical superiority of the French and their allies, and in part to the condition of his newly reorganized troops. His six weeks' inaction after the victory of Aspern is, however, open to unfavourable criticism. As a military writer, his position in the evolution of the art of war is very important, and his doctrines had naturally the greatest weight. Nevertheless they cannot but be considered as antiquated even in 1806. Caution and the importance of strategic points are the chief features of his system. The rigidity of his geographical strategy may be gathered from the prescription that this principle is never to be departed from.

Again and again he repeats the advice that nothing should be hazarded unless one's army is completely secure, a rule which he himself neglected with such brilliant results in 1796. Strategic points, he says (not the defeat of the enemy's army), decide the fate of one's own country, and must constantly remain the general's main solicitude, a maxim which was never more remarkably disproved than in the war of 1809. The editor of the archduke's work is able to make but a feeble defence against [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]]'s reproach that Charles attached more value to ground than to the annihilation of the foe. In his tactical writings the same spirit is conspicuous. His reserve in battle is designed to cover a retreat. 
[[Image:Archduke_Charles_Statue.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Statue of Archduke Charles on the [[Heldenplatz]] in [[Vienna]].]]
The baneful influence of these antiquated principles was clearly shown in the maintenance of Königgratz-Josefstadt in [[1866]] as a strategic point, which was preferred to the defeat of the separated Prussian armies. In the strange plans produced in Vienna for the campaign of 1859, and in the almost unintelligible [[Battle of Montebello (1859)|Battle of Montebello]] in the same year. The theory and the practice of Archduke Charles form one of the most curious contrasts in military history. In the one he is unreal, in the other he displayed, along with the greatest skill, a vivid activity which made him for long the most formidable opponent of Napoleon.

On the battlefield, it is probably fair to say, Charles was comparable in skill and style to Sir [[Arthur Wellesley]] - quite conservative and yet exceedingly competent. That Wellesley emerged with a superior reputation is probably due to the fact that he only once faced Napoleon and even then was only co-commander of an Allied force. By contrast Charles was confronted by Napoleon in battle more times than any other commander. On these occasions the reliable and yet unimaginative tactics Charles was fond of were not sufficient (except on one occasion at Aspern-Essling) to defeat the unpredictable Corsican. Nonetheless Charles is a member of a pantheon of famous Napoleonic figures that includes the Emperor himself, [[Louis Nicolas Davout]], [[Karl Philipp Fürst zu Schwarzenberg|Karl von Schwarzenberg]], [[Alexander Suvorov]], [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher]] and the aforementioned Sir Arthur Wellesley.

==Writings and References==
His writings were edited by Archduke Albert and his brother Archduke William in the ''Ausgewählte Schriften weiland Sr. K. Hoheit Erzh. Carl v. Osterreich'' (1862; reprinted 1893, Vienna and Leipzig), which includes the ''Grundsätze der Kriegskunst für die Generale'' (1806), ''Grundsätze der Strategie erläutert durch die Darstellung des Feldzugs 1796'' (1814), ''Geschichte des Feldzugs von 299'' (1819)--the two latter invaluable contributions to the history of the war, and papers on the higher art of war, on practical training in the field, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Augustine of Canterbury''' (birth unknown, died [[May 26]], [[604]]) was the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], sent to [[Ethelbert of Kent]], [[Bretwalda]] of England by [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]] in [[597]].  He was accompanied by [[Laurence of Canterbury]], the second [[archbishop]].

In [[596]], Augustine was ''praepositus'' (prior) of the monastery of [[Saint Andrew]], founded by [[Pope Gregory I]], and was sent by Gregory at the head of forty monks to preach to the Anglo-Saxons. They lost heart on the way and Augustine went back to Rome from [[Provence]] and asked that the mission be given up.  The pope, however, commanded and encouraged them to proceed, and they landed on the Island of [[Thanet]] in the spring of [[597]]. 

Ethelbert's wife Bertha, daughter of [[Charibert]], one of the [[Merovingian]] kings of the [[Franks]], had brought a chaplain with her (Liudhard) and either built a church, or restored a church in Canterbury from Roman times, and dedicated it to [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]] (either of which is possibly [[Church of St. Martin, Canterbury|St. Martin's]]), a major patronal saint for the Merovingian royal family. Ethelbert himself was a [[Paganism|pagan]], but allowed his wife to worship God her own way.  Probably under influence of his wife, Ethelbert asked [[Pope Gregory I]] to send missionaries.

Ethelbert permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his town of [[Canterbury]] and before the end of the year he was converted and Augustine was consecrated bishop at [[Arles]]. At [[Christmas]] 10,000 of the king's subjects were baptized. 

Augustine sent a report of his success to Gregory with certain questions concerning his work. In [[601]] [[Mellitus]], [[Justus]] and others brought the pope's replies, with the [[pallium]] for Augustine and a present of sacred vessels, [[vestment]]s, [[relic]]s, books, and the like. Gregory directed the new archbishop to ordain as soon as possible twelve [[suffragan]] [[bishop]]s and to send a bishop to [[York]], who should also have twelve suffragans &amp;mdash; a plan which was not carried out, nor was the primatial [[episcopal see|see]] established at [[London]] as Gregory intended. Augustine consecrated [[Mellitus]] Bishop of London and Justus Bishop of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]].

More practicable were the pope's mandates concerning heathen temples and usages: the former were to be consecrated to Christian service and the latter, so far as possible, to be transformed into dedication ceremonies or feasts of martyrs, since &quot;he who would climb to a lofty height must go up by steps, not leaps&quot; (letter of Gregory to Mellitus, in [[Bede]], i, 30). 

Augustine reconsecrated and rebuilt an old church at Canterbury as his cathedral and founded a monastery in connection with it. He also restored a church and founded the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul outside the walls. He is claimed to have founded [[The King's School, Canterbury]], which would make it the world's oldest school; however there may be little more to this than that some teaching took place at the monastery.

His attempts to effect a union with the [[Old British Church]] in [[Wales]] failed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexander Hales'''
(also '''Halensis''', '''Alensis''', '''Halesius''', '''Alesius'''; called  ''Doctor Irrefragabilis'' and ''Theologorum Monarcha'') was a [[scholasticism|scholastic ]] [[theology|theologian]]. He was born at [[Hales]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]], and died in [[Paris]] on [[August 21]], [[1245]]. He was educated in the monastery at Hales, studied and lectured at Paris, acquired great fame as a teacher in theology, and entered the [[Franciscan|Franciscan order]] in [[1222]]. 

Alexander was the first to write a commentary on the [[Sentences]] of [[Peter Lombard]], before him theologians had always commented upon the scriptures. His ''Summa universae theologiae'' (first printed at [[Venice, Italy|Venice]], [[1475]]) was undertaken at the request of  [[Pope Innocent IV]], and received his approbation. It was finished by Alexander's scholars after his death. It is an independent work giving a triple series of  authorities-- those who say yes, those who say no, and then the reconciliation or judgment. The authorities are chosen not only from the [[Bible]] and the Fathers, but also among Greek, Latin, and Arabic poets and philosophers, and later theologians. It treats in its first part the doctrines of [[God]] and his attributes; in its second, those of [[creation (theology)|Creation]] and [[sin]]; in its third, those of [[redemption]] and [[atonement]]; and, in its fourth and last, those of the [[sacrament]]s.  In recognition of his efforts, Alexander was given the title of &quot;Doctor Irrefragabilis&quot;.

Among the doctrines which were specially developed and, so to speak, fixed by Alexander of Hales, are those of the  ''[[thesaurus supererogationis perfectorum]]'', and of the ''[[sacramental character|character indelibilis]]'' of [[baptism]], 
[[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]], and [[Holy Orders|ordination]].  That doctrine had been written about much earlier by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and was eventually defined a [[dogma]] by the [[Council of Trent]].

John Gerson tells us “The doctrine of Alexander is of a wealth surpassing all expression. It is said that someone asked St. Thomas what was the best manner of studying theology; he replied that it was by attaching oneself to a Master. And to which Doctor? he was asked again. To Alexander of Hales, the [[Thomas Aquinas|Angelic Doctor]] replied.&quot; (Gerson, Opera omnia.Epistola Lugdunum missa cuidam fratri Minori, vol. 1, p. 554.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For other meanings, see [[ASP]].'' 
'''Active Server Pages''' ('''ASP''') is [[Microsoft]]'s [[Server (computing)|server]]-side technology for dynamically-generated web pages that is marketed as an add-on to [[Internet Information Services]] (IIS).

Programming ASP [[website]]s is made easier by various [[Wiktionary:built-in|built-in]] [[Object (computer science)|objects]].  Each object corresponds to a group of frequently-used functionality useful for creating [[dynamic web page]]s.  In ASP 3.0 there are six such built-in objects: Application, ASPError, Request, Response, Server and Session. Session, for example, is a [[cookie]]-based [[Session (computer science)|session]] object that maintains [[variable]]s from page to page.  [[Application Center Test]] is also available for load testing.

Most ASP pages are written in [[VBScript]], but any other [[Active Scripting]] engine can be selected instead by using the &lt;tt&gt;@Language&lt;/tt&gt; directive. [[JScript]] (Microsoft's implementation of [[ECMAScript]]) is the other language that is usually available. PerlScript ([[Perl]]) and others are available as third-party installable Active Scripting engines.

==Versions==
ASP has gone through four major releases:

* ASP 1.0 (distributed with IIS 3.0) in December 1996, 
* ASP 2.0 (distributed with IIS 4.0) in September 1997, 
* ASP 3.0 (distributed with IIS 5.0) in November 2000,
* [[ASP.NET]] (part of the [[.NET Framework|Microsoft .NET platform]]) in January 2002 (the pre-.NET versions are currently referred to as &quot;classic&quot; ASP)
* ASP.NET version 2.0 (released on November 7th, 2005).

ASP.NET introduced the ability to replace in-HTML scripting with full-fledged support for [[.NET Framework|.NET]] languages such as [[Visual Basic .NET]] and [[C Sharp programming language|C#]].  In-page scripting can still be used (and is fully supported), but now pages can use VB.NET and C# classes to generate pages instead of code in HTML pages.

==Apache::ASP==
[http://www.apache-asp.org/ Apache::ASP] provides an Active Server Pages port to the Apache Web Server with Perl scripting only, and enables developing of dynamic web applications with session management and embedded Perl code.

'''Amoxicillin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''amoxycillin''' (former [[British Approved Name|BAN]]) is a moderate-spectrum [[beta-lactam antibiotic|&amp;beta;-lactam antibiotic]] used to treat bacterial [[infection]]s caused by susceptible [[microorganism]]s. It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better absorbed, following oral administration, than other beta-lactam antibiotics.  Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by [[beta-lactamase|&amp;beta;-lactamase]]-producing bacteria, and so may be given with [[Clavulanic acid]] to increase its susceptability (see below).  It is currently marketed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] under the trade name '''Amoxil'''&amp;reg;.

==Mode of action==
Amoxicillin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the cell wall of [[Gram-positive]] bacteria.

''Main article: [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]''

==Microbiology==
Amoxicillin is a moderate-spectrum antibiotic active against a wide range of [[Gram-positive]], and a limited range of [[Gram-negative]] organisms. Some examples of susceptible and resistant organisms, from the Amoxil® Approved Product Information (GSK, 2003), are listed below.

===Susceptible Gram-positive organisms===
''[[Streptococcus]]'' spp., ''[[Diplococcus]] pneumoniae'', non [[beta-lactamase|&amp;beta;-lactamase]]-producing ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' spp., and ''[[Streptococcus]] faecalis.''

===Susceptible Gram-negative organisms===
''[[Haemophilus]] influenzae'', ''[[Neisseria]] gonorrhoeae'', ''[[Neisseria]] meningitidis'', ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]] mirabilis'' and ''[[Salmonella]] spp.''

===Resistant organisms===
Penicillinase producing organisms, particularly penicillinase producing ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' spp. Penicillinase-producing ''N. gonorrhoeae'' and ''H. influenzae'' are also resistant

All strains of ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' spp., ''[[Klebsiella]]'' spp., ''[[Enterobacter]]'' spp., [[indole]]-positive ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]]'' spp., ''[[Serratia]]'' marcescens, and ''[[Citrobacter]]'' spp. are resistant.

The incidence of &amp;beta;-lactamase-producing resistant organisms, including ''E. coli'', appears to be increasing.

Doubling the routinely given concentration (in pediatrics) of amoxicillin has been shown to eradicate intermediately resistant organisms (Red Book, 2003 Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, American Academy of Pediatrics).

==Formulations==
Amoxicillin in trihydrate form is avaialable as capsules or syrup for oral use, and as the sodium salt for intravenous administration.

== Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid ==
Amoxicillin (in either trihydrate or sodium salt forms) may be combined with [[Clavulanic acid]] (as [[potassium clavulanate]]), a &amp;beta;-lactamase inhibitor, to increase the spectrum of action against [[Gram-negative]] organisms, and to overcome bacterial antibiotic resistance mediated through &amp;beta;-lactamase production. This formulation is referred to as [[Co-amoxiclav]] ([[British Approved Name]]), but more commonly by proprietary names such as [[Augmentin]]® and Clamoxyl®.

''Main article: [[Co-amoxiclav]]''

== Proprietary Preparations ==
The patent for amoxicillin has expired. Thus amoxicillin is marketed under many trade names including: Actimoxi®, Amoxibiotic®, Amoxicilina®, Dispermox&amp;reg;,Pamoxicillin®, Lamoxy®, Ospamox®, Polymox®, Trimox®, Tolodina®, Wymox® and Zimox®.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''amorphous solid''' is a [[solid]] in which there is no [[long-range order]] of the positions of the [[atom]]s.  (Solids in which there is long-range atomic order are called [[crystal|crystalline solids]].) Most classes of solid materials can be found or prepared in an amorphous form. For instance, common window glass is an amorphous [[ceramic]], many [[polymer]]s (such as [[polystyrene]]) are amorphous, and even foods such as [[cotton candy]] are amorphous solids.

Amorphous materials are often prepared by rapidly cooling molten material.  The cooling reduces the mobility of the material's molecules before they can pack into a more thermodynamically favorable crystaline state.  Some materials, such as metals, are difficult to prepare in an amorphous state.  Unless a material has a high melting temperature (as ceramics do) or a low crystallization energy (as polymers tend to), solidification must be done extremely rapidly.

Amorphous solids can exist in two distinct states, the 'rubbery' state and the 'glassy' state.  The temperature at which the transition between the glassy and rubbery states is called their [[glass transition temperature]] or ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;.  

==Glasses==
In common parlance, the term [[glass]] refers to amorphous oxides, and especially silicates (compounds based on silicon and oxygen). Ordinary soda-lime [[glass]], used in windows and drinking containers, is created by the addition of [[soda]] and lime ([[calcium oxide]]) to [[silicon dioxide]]. Without these additives silicon dioxide will (with slow cooling) form [[sand]] or [[quartz]] crystal, not [[glass]]. 

To avoid confusion, other types of glass often are referred to with a modifier, such as the term ''metallic glass'' to refer to [[amorphous metal]]lic alloys.  
{{unsolved|physics|What is the nature of the [[phase transition|transition]] between a fluid or regular solid and a glassy [[phase (matter)|phase]]? What are the physical processes giving rise to the general properties of glasses?}}

===Metallic glass===
Some amorphous metallic alloys can be prepared under special processing conditions (such as [[rapid solidification]], [[thin-film deposition]], or [[ion implantation]]), but the term &quot;metallic glass&quot; refers only to rapidly solidified materials. 

Even with special equipment, such rapid cooling is required that, for most metals, only a thin wire or ribbon can be made amorphous. This is enough for many [[magnetic]] applications, but thicker sections are required for most structural applications such as [[scalpel]] blades, [[golf club]]s, and cases for [[consumer electronics]].  Recent efforts have made it possible to increase the  maximum thickness of glassy [[casting]]s, by finding alloys where [[kinetic]] barriers to crystallization are greater.  Such alloy systems tend to have the following inter-related properties:
*Many different solid [[phase (matter)|phase]]s are present in the equilibrium solid, so that any potential crystal will find that most of the nearby atoms are of the wrong type to join in crystallization
*The composition is near a deep [[eutectic]], so that low melting temperatures can be achieved without sacrificing the slow diffusion and high liquid viscosity seen in alloys with high-melting pure components
*Atoms with a wide variety of sizes are present, so that &quot;wrong-sized&quot; atoms interfere with the crystallization process by binding to atom clusters as they form.
One such alloy is the commercial &quot;[[Liquidmetal]]&quot;, which can be cast in amorphous sections up to an inch thick.

==Other synthesis routes==

Amorphous solids produced by other routes, such as [[ion implantation]] and [[thin-film deposition]] are, technically speaking, not glasses.

===Damage===
One way to produce a material without an ordered structure is to take a crystalline material and remove the order by damaging it.  A practical, controllable way to do this is by firing [[ions]] into the material at high speed, so that collisions inside the material knock all atoms from their original positions.  This technique is known as [[ion implantation]], and only forms amorphous solids if the material is too cold for atoms to diffuse back to their original positions as the process continues.

===Cold Deposition===
Techniques such as [[sputtering]] and [[CVD]] can be used to deposit a thin film of material onto a surface.  If the surface is kept cold, the atoms being deposited will not, on average, gain enough energy to diffuse along the surface until they find a place in an ordered crystal.  For every deposition technique, there is a substrate temperature below which the deposited film will be amorphous.  However, surface [[diffusion]] requires much less energy than diffusion through the bulk, so that these temperatures are often lower than those required to make amorphous films by ion implantation.

==Toward a strict definition==

It is difficult to make a distinction between truly amorphous solids and crystalline solids in which the size of the crystals is very small (less than two [[nanometre]]s). Even amorphous materials have some short-range order among the atomic positions (over length scales of about one [[nanometre]]). Furthermore, in very small [[crystal]]s a large fraction of the [[atom]]s are located at or near the surface of the crystal; relaxation of the surface and interfacial effects distort the atomic positions, decreasing the structural order. Even the most advanced structural characterization techniques, such as x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, have difficulty in distinguishing between amorphous and crystalline structures on these length scales.

The transition from the liquid state to the glass, at a temperature below the equilibrium melting point of the material, is called the [[glass transition]]. From a practical point of view, the glass transition temperature is defined empirically as the temperature at which the [[viscosity]] of the liquid exceeds a certain value (commonly 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; [[pascal second|pascal-seconds]]). The transition temperature depends on cooling rate, with the glass transition occurring at higher temperatures for faster cooling rates. The precise nature of the glass transition is the subject of ongoing research. While it is clear that the glass transition is not a first-order thermodynamic transition (such as melting), there is debate as to whether it is a higher-order transition, or merely a kinetic effect.

Glass is often referred to as a 'super-cooled' liquid: this amounts to an assertion that the glass transition is purely a kinetic, rather than a thermodynamic effect.  One argument against speaking this way is the fact that many supercooled liquids flow (see [[pitch drop experiment]]) whereas glass does not (see special section in [[glass]]).

Some examples of amorphous solids are [[glass]], [[polystyrene]], and the [[silicon]] in many [[Thin-film deposition|thin film]] [[solar cell]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''A Wizard of Earthsea''''', first published in [[1968]], is the first of a series of books written by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] and set in her [[fantasy]] [[archipelago]] of [[Earthsea]].  The tale of the eponymous wizard &amp;ndash; after this, his first great adventure &amp;ndash; continues in ''[[The Tombs of Atuan]]'', and ''[[The Farthest Shore]]'', but Le Guin has written a number of other novels and short stories set in the world of Earthsea.

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

In the novel, a young man, Sparrowhawk, comes of age on his home island of Gont. While still a boy, he discovers that he has the inborn aptitude to practice [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Some years later, he uses this ability to save his village from a raiding party of barbarians. In the aftermath of the battle, in a rite of passage that leads him into adulthood, he is given his true, secret name (&quot;[[Ged (fictional character)|Ged]]&quot;) and is apprenticed to the wizard [[Ogion]] the Silent.

Sparrowhawk then travels to the school of wizardry on [[Roke]] Island, masters his craft easily, and, in his [[hubris]], summons a spirit of darkness that scars him and leaves him for dead.

After a painful and slow recovery, Sparrowhawk is sent out into the world as a wizard. He has a series of adventures, including surviving a confrontation with a [[western dragon|dragon]]. At last he resolves to track down the foe he has released and destroy or banish it.

Ultimately Sparrowhawk confronts the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] that hunts him, and defeats it by realizing that it is his own shadow. He calls the shadow, which was thought to be nameless, by name &amp;ndash; &quot;Ged&quot;. In doing so, he reconciles both sides of himself and takes responsibility for his past mistakes which, until then, he had run from.

== About the book and its author ==
''A Wizard of Earthsea'' is a coming-of-age story, written with an eye for a young adult audience. It won the [[Boston Globe-Hornbook Award]] for juvenile fiction in [[1968]]. It is, in effect, a fantasy [[Bildungsroman]] &amp;ndash; the story of a young man's quest for wisdom and spiritual wholeness, written in a sparse prose style.

Le Guin has said that the book was in part a response to the image of wizards as ancient and wise, and to her wondering where they come from. The author is famous for her [[science fiction]] and fantasy works; over her career she has received about an award a year,[http://www.ursulakleguin.com/Bio2001.html] among them a total of ten of the most prestigious of them all, the [[Hugo award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula award|Nebula]] awards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Great Ape Project logo.jpg|right|thumb|320px|The logo of the [[Great Ape Project]], which is campaigning for a [[Declaration on Great Apes]]. [http://www.greatapeproject.org/declaration.html] ]]

'''Animal rights''', or '''animal liberation''', is the movement to protect animals from being used or regarded as property by human beings. It is a [[radicalism|radical]] [[social movement]], insofar as it aims not merely to attain more [[humane]] treatment for animals, but also to include species other than [[Human|human beings]] within the moral community by giving their basic interests &amp;mdash; for example, the interest in avoiding suffering &amp;mdash; the same consideration as our own. The claim, in other words, is that animals should no longer be regarded [[Law|legally]] or [[Moral philosophy|morally]] as property, or treated merely as resources for human purposes, but should instead be regarded as [[persons]].

Some countries have passed legislation awarding recognition to the interests of animals. [[Switzerland]] recognized animals as beings, not things, in 1992, and in 2002, the protection of animals was added to the [[Germany|German]] constitution. The [[Seattle]]-based [[Great Ape Project]], founded by [[Australia]]n philosopher [[Peter Singer]], is campaigning for the [[United Nations]] to adopt its [[Declaration on Great Apes]], which would see [[gorilla]]s, [[orangutan]]s, and both species of [[chimpanzee]] included in a &quot;community of equals&quot; with human beings, and which would extend to them the protection of three basic interests: the [[right to life]], the protection of individual [[liberty]], and the prohibition of [[torture]]. [http://www.greatapeproject.org/declaration.html] 

Critics of the concept of animal [[right]]s argue that, because animals do not have the capacity to enter into a [[social contract]] [http://articles.animalconcerns.org/ar-voices/archive/case_for_ar.html] or make [[Morality|moral]] choices, cannot respect the rights of others, and do not even understand the idea of rights, they cannot be regarded as possessors of moral rights. The [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Roger Scruton]] argues that only human beings have [[Duty|duties]] and that &quot;[t]he corollary is inescapable: we alone have rights.&quot; [http://www.city-journal.org/html/10_3_urbanities-animal.html] Critics holding this position argue that there is nothing inherently wrong with using animals for [[Meat|food]], as entertainment, and in [[Animal testing|research]], though human beings may nevertheless have an obligation to ensure they do not suffer unnecessarily (Frey 1980 and Scruton 1997). This position is generally called the [[animal welfare]] position, and it is held by some of the oldest of the animal-protection agencies: for example, by the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] in the UK.

==Overview==
{{Template:Animal liberation movement}}
Animal rights is the concept that all or some animals are entitled to possess their own lives; that animals are deserving of, or already possess, certain [[moral]] rights; and that some basic rights for animals ought to be enshrined in law. The animal-rights view rejects the concept that animals are merely [[capital goods]] or [[property]] intended for the benefit of humans. The concept is often confused with [[animal welfare]], which is the philosophy that takes cruelty towards animals and animal suffering into account, but that does not necessarily assign specific moral rights to them.

The animal-rights [[philosophy]] does not necessarily maintain that human and non-human animals are equal. For example, animal rights advocates do not call for [[voting rights]] for chickens. Some also would make a distinction between [[sentient]] or self-aware animals and other life forms, with the belief that only sentient animals, or perhaps only animals who have a significant degree of self-awareness, should be afforded the right to possess their own lives and bodies, without regard to how they are valued by humans. Others would extend this right to all animals, even those without developed [[nervous system]]s or self-[[consciousness]]. They maintain that any [[human]] or human institution that commodifies animals for the purposes of [[food]], [[entertainment]], [[cosmetics]], [[clothing]], [[Animal testing|scientific testing]], or for any other reason, infringes upon their fundamental rights to possess themselves and to pursue their own ends. 

Few people would deny that other [[great apes]] are highly intelligent animals who are aware of their own condition and goals, and can become frustrated when their freedoms are curtailed. In contrast, many other animals, like [[jellyfish]], have only extremely simple nervous systems, and are little more than simple automata, capable only of simple reflexes but incapable of formulating any &quot;ends to their actions&quot; or &quot;plans to pursue&quot; them, and equally unable to notice whether they are in captivity or free. By the criteria that [[biologists]] use, jelly fish are undeniably animals, while from an animal-rights perspective, it is questionable whether they should not rather be considered &quot;vegetables&quot;. There is as yet no consensus with regard to which qualities make a living organism an animal in need of rights. The animal-rights debate (much like the [[abortion]] debate) is therefore marred by the difficulty that its proponents search for simple, clear-cut distinctions on which to base moral and political judgements, even though the biological realities of the problem present no hard and fast boundaries on which such distinctions could be based. Rather, the biological realities are full of complex and diverse gradients. From a [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] perspective, jellyfish, farmed chicken, laboratory mice, or pet cats would fall along different points on a (complex and high-dimensional) spectrum from the &quot;nearly vegetable&quot; to the &quot;highly sentient&quot;.

== Animal rights in philosophy ==

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] briefly alludes to the concept of animal rights in the preface of his [[Discourse on Inequality]]. He argues that man starts as an animal, though not one &quot;devoid of intellect and freedom&quot; like others; however, as animals are sensitive beings, &quot;they too ought to participate in natural right, and that man is subject to some sort of duties toward them,&quot; specifically &quot;one [has] the right not to be uselessly mistreated by the other.&quot;

Contemporaneous with Rousseau was the Scottish writer [[John Oswald (d. 1793)]].  Oswald argued in &quot;The Cry of Nature or an Appeal to Mercy and Justice on Behalf of the Persecuted Animals&quot;, that man is naturally equipped with feelings of mercy and compassion.  If each man had to personally experience the death of the animals he ate, so argued Oswald, a vegetarian diet would be far more common.  The division of labor, however, allows modern man to eat flesh without experiencing the prompting of man's natural sensitivities, while the brutalization of modern man made him inured to these sensitivities.  Although Oswald gave compassion a central place in his philosophy, he was not a pacifist.  Oswald was a radical republican and died in battle fighting in defence of the [[French Revolution]].

One of the first philosophers to take animal liberation seriously was one of the founders of modern [[utilitarianism]], [[Jeremy Bentham]], who wrote, speaking of the need to extend legal rights to animals: &quot;The day may come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been witholden from them but by the hand of tyranny.&quot; Bentham also argued that an animal's apparent lack of rationality ought not to be held against it insofar as morality is concerned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It may one day come to be recognized that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the ''os sacrum'' are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse?  But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as more conversable  animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month old. But suppose they were otherwise, what would it avail?  The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk?  but, Can they suffer? Why should the law refuse its protection to any sensitive being? The time will come when humanity will extend its mantle over everything which breathes ... (Bentham, 1781)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that animals have the same essence as humans, despite lacking the faculty of reason. Although he produced a utilitarian justification for eating animals, he argued for consideration to be given to animals in morality, and he opposed [[vivisection]]. His critique of [[Kant]]ian ethics contained a lengthy and often furious polemic against the exclusion of animals in his moral system, which contained the famous line: &quot;Cursed be any morality that does not see the essential unity in all eyes that see the sun.&quot;

The concept of animal rights was the subject of an influential book &amp;mdash; ''Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress'' &amp;mdash; by [[England|English]] social reformer [[Henry Salt]] in 1892. A year earlier, Salt had formed the Humanitarian League; its objectives included the banning of hunting as a sport. 

In modern times, the idea of animal rights was re-introduced by S. and R. Godlovitch, and J. Harris, with their 1971 book ''Animals, Men and Morals''. This was a collection of articles which restated the case for animal rights in a powerful and philosophically sophisticated way. It could justly be said that it was this work that reinvigorated the animal rights movement, and it inspired later philosophers to develop their ideas. It was, for example, in a review of this book, that the Australian philosopher [[Peter Singer]], now Ira W. DeCamp Professor of [[Bioethics]] in the University Center for Human Values at [[Princeton University]], first coined the term 'animal liberation.'

Peter Singer and [[Tom Regan]] are the best-known proponents of animal liberation, though they differ in their philosophical approaches to the issue. Another influential thinker is [[Gary L. Francione]], who presents an [[abolitionist]] view that non-human animals should have the basic right not to be treated as the property of humans. Activists [[Karen Davis]] of [[United Poultry Concerns]], and [[Ingrid Newkirk]] of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] have also presented philosophies of animal rights. 

Although Singer is the ideological founder of today's animal-rights movement, his approach to an animal's moral status is not based on the concept of rights, but on the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] principle of [[equal consideration of interests]]. His 1975 book ''[[Animal Liberation]]'' argues that humans grant moral consideration to other humans not on the basis of intelligence (in the instance of children, or the mentally disabled), on the ability to moralize (criminals and the insane), or on any other attribute that is inherently human, but rather on their ability to experience ''suffering''. As animals also experience suffering, he argues, excluding animals from such consideration is a form of discrimination known as '[[speciesism]]' &amp;mdash; a term first coined by the British psychologist [[Richard D. Ryder]].

Tom Regan (''The Case for Animal Rights'' and ''[[Empty Cages]]''), on the other side, claims that non-human animals as &quot;subjects-of-a-life&quot; are bearers of rights like humans, although not necessarily of the same degree. This means that animals in this class have &quot;inherent value&quot; as individuals, and cannot merely be considered as the means to an end. This is also called the &quot;direct duty&quot; view. According to Regan, we should abolish the breeding of animals for food, animal experimentation, and commercial hunting. Regan's theory does not extend to all sentient animals but only to those that can be regarded as &quot;subjects-of-a-life.&quot; Regan argues that all normal mammals of at least one year of age would qualify in this regard.  

While Singer is primarily concerned with improving the treatment of animals and accepts that, at least in some hypothetical scenarios, animals could be legitimately used for further (human or non-human) ends, Regan believes we ought to treat animals as we would persons, and he applies the strict [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] idea that they ought never to be sacrificed as mere means to ends, and must be treated as ends unto themselves. Notably, Kant himself did not believe animals were subject to what he called the moral law; he believed we ought to show compassion, but primarily because not to do so brutalizes human beings, and not for the sake of animals themselves. 

Despite these theoretical differences, both Singer and Regan agree about what to do in practice: for instance, they both agree that the adoption of a [[veganism|vegan]] diet and the abolition of nearly all forms of [[animal experimentation]] are ethically mandatory. 

[[Gary Francione]]'s work (''Introduction to Animal Rights'', et.al.) is based on the premise that if non-human animals are considered to be property then any rights that they may be granted would be directly undermined by that property status. He points out that a call to equally consider the 'interests' of your property against your own interests is absurd. Without the basic right not to be treated as the property of humans, non-human animals have no rights whatsoever, he says. Francione posits that sentience is the only valid determinant for moral standing, unlike Regan who sees qualitative degrees in the subjective experiences of his &quot;subjects-of-a-life&quot; based upon a loose determination of who falls within that category. Francione claims that there is no actual animal-rights movement in the United States, but only an [[animal welfare|animal-welfarist]] movement. In line with his philosophical position and his work in animal-rights law for the Animal Rights Law Project [http://animal-law.org] at [[Rutgers University]], he points out that any effort that does not advocate the abolition of the property status of animals is misguided, in that it inevitably results in the institutionalization of animal exploitation. It is logically inconsistent and doomed never to achieve its stated goal of improving the condition of animals, he argues. Francione holds that a society which regards dogs and cats as family members yet kills cows, chickens, and pigs for food exhibits what he calls &quot;moral schizophrenia&quot;.

== Animal rights in [[law]] ==
[[Image:600-restraint-tube4.jpg|left|thumb|350px|A monkey in a restraint tube filmed by [[PETA]] in a [[Covance]] branch, [[Vienna, Virginia]], 2004-5 [http://www.covancecruelty.com/photos.asp] ]]

Animals are protected under the [[law]], though without having rights assigned to them. There are [[criminal law]]s against cruelty to animals, laws that regulate the keeping of animals in cities and on farms, the transit of animals internationally, as well as quarantine and inspection provisions. These laws are designed to protect animals from unnecessary physical harm and to regulate the use of animals as food. In the [[common law]], it is possible to create a [[charitable trust]] and have the trust empowered to see to the care of a particular animal after the death of the benefactor of the trust. Some individuals create such trusts in their [[will (law)|will]]. Trusts of this kind can be upheld by the [[court]]s if properly drafted and if the [[testator]] is of sound mind. There are several movements in the UK campaigning to require the [[British parliament]] to award greater protection to animals. The legislation, if passed, will introduce a [[duty]] of care, whereby a keeper of an animal would commit an offence if he or she fails to take reasonable steps to ensure an animal’s welfare. This concept of giving the animal keeper a duty towards the animal is equivalent to granting the animal a right to proper welfare. The draft bill is supported by an [[RSPCA]] campaign.

[[Switzerland]] passed legislation in 1992 to recognize animals as beings, not things; and in 2002, the protection of animals was enshrined in the [[Germany|German]] constitution when its upper house of parliament voted to add the words &quot;and animals&quot; to the clause in the constitution obliging the state to protect the &quot;natural foundations of life ... in the interests of future generations.&quot; [http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/06/21/germany.animals/index.html] [http://www.ebra.org/bulletin/win05_02.html] 

The State of [[Israel]], meanwhile, has banned dissections of animals in elementary and secondary schools; performances by trained animals in circuses; and [[foie gras]]. &lt;!--banned the production, sale, or both, do we know?--&gt;

== Animal rights in practice ==
[[Image:ALFbeagles.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF)]]
In practice, those who advocate animal rights usually boycott a number of industries that use animals.  Foremost among these is [[factory farming]], [http://www.meetyourmeat.com/wycd.html]
which produces the majority of [[meat]], [[dairy product]]s, and [[egg (food)|eggs]] in Western industrialized nations. The transportation of farm animals for slaughter, which often involves their [[live export]], has in recent years been a major issue of campaigning for animal-rights groups, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

The vast majority of animal-rights advocates adopt [[vegetarian]] or [[vegan]] diets; they may also avoid clothes made of animal skins, such as [[leather]] shoes, and will not use products such as [[cosmetics]], [[pharmaceutical]] products, or certain [[ink]]s or [[dye]]s known to contain so-called animal [[byproduct]]s. Goods containing ingredients that have been tested on animals are also avoided where possible. Company-wide [[boycott]]s are common. The [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] corporation, for example, [[Animal testing|tests]] many of its products on animals, leading many animal-rights supporters to boycott all of their products, including food like peanut butter.

The vast majority of animal-rights advocates dedicate themselves to educating the public.  Some organizations, like ''[[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]'', strive to do this by garnering media attention for animal-rights issues, often using outrageous stunts or advertisements to obtain media coverage for a more serious message.

There is a growing trend in the American animal-rights movement towards devoting all resources to vegetarian outreach. The 9.8 billion animals killed there for food use every year far exceeds the number of animals being exploited in other ways. Groups such as ''Vegan Outreach'' and ''Compassion Over Killing'' devote their time to exposing factory-farming practices by publishing information for consumers and by organizing undercover investigations.

A growing number of animal-rights activists engage in [[direct action]]. This typically involves the removal of animals from facilities that use them or the damage of property at such facilities in order to cause financial loss.  A few incidents have involved [[violence]] or the threat of violence toward animal [[Vivisection|experimenters]] or others involved in the use of animals.
&lt;!--I'm making this paragraph invisible as it's problematic, as follows: The first sentence needs a reference for the FBI claim, and for the denouncing of direct action by many animal-rights groups: &quot;As a result of &quot;direct action&quot; tactics, the following needs a reference: (the [[FBI]] has announced that it considers the [[Animal Liberation Front]] and [[Earth Liberation Front]] the number one [[terrorism|terrorist]] groups native to the [[United States]]) many animal-rights organizations denounce its use in advancing the animal rights cause.&quot; This sentence is okay: &quot;Most animal-rights groups, including activists who work under the banner of the [[Animal Liberation Front]], reject the use of violence by people acting in their name.&quot; This sentence needs references: &quot;However, some radical animal-right activists in Canada, the UK and the US actively engage in harassment of family homes of individual workers of research facilities, related businesses and individual shareholders.&quot; It also needs clarification. Is harassment of individuals being counted as violence? Is SHAC, which does this, being counted as more radical than the ALF, which the previous sentence seems to suggest doesn't? --&gt;
There are also a growing number of &quot;open rescues,&quot; in which animal-rights advocates enter businesses to steal animals without trying to hide their identities. Open rescues tend to be carried out by committed individuals who are willing to go to jail if prosecuted, but so far no factory-farm owner has been willing to press charges, perhaps because of the negative publicity that would ensue. However some countries like Britain have proposed stricter laws to curb animal extremists.

== Criticism of animal rights ==
Criticism against the concept of animal rights include philosophical arguments that to have rights requires moral judgements, that animal rights actually turns humans into second-class citizens under animals, and that humans have a responsibility to promote [[Animal welfare]] instead of animal rights. Criticism against the animal right movement include statements that the animal rights movement is actually anti-human. Each crticism is detailed below.

===Rights requires moral judgements===
Critics such as Carl Cohen, professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan and the University of Michigan Medical School, oppose the granting of &quot;personhood&quot; to animals. Cohen wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine in October, 1986: [http://www.animaluse.org/html/why_we_oppose.html]
&lt;blockquote&gt;The holders of rights must have the capacity to comprehend rules of duty governing all, including themselves. In applying such rules, the holders of rights must recognize possible conflicts between what is in their own interest and what is just. Only in a community of beings capable of self-restricting moral judgments can the concept of a right be correctly invoked.&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cohen rejects Peter Singer's argument that since a brain-damaged human could not exhibit the ability to make moral judgements, that moral judgements cannot be used as the distinguishing characteristic for determining who is awarded rights. Cohen states that the test for moral judgement &quot;is not a test to be administered to humans one by one.&quot; [http://www.animaluse.org/html/why_we_oppose.html]

The Foundation for Animal Use and Education states: [http://www.animaluse.org/html/why_we_oppose.html]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our recognition of the rights of others stems from our unique human character as moral agents--that is, beings capable of making moral judgments and comprehending moral duty. Only human beings are capable of exercising moral judgment and recognizing the rights of one another. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Animals do not exercise responsibility as moral agents. They do not recognize the rights of other animals. They kill and eat one another instinctively, as a matter of survival. They act from a combination of conditioning, fear, instinct and intelligence, but they do not exercise moral judgment in the process.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Animal rights can be anti-human===
Some critics of &quot;animal rights&quot; say that it may turn humans into &quot;second-class citizens&quot;. [http://www.animaluse.org/html/why_we_oppose.html] Robert Bidinotto, nationally recognized writer on environmental issues, said in a 1992 speech to the Northeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies: [http://www.animaluse.org/html/why_we_oppose.html]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Strict observance of animal rights forbids even direct protection of people and their values against nature's many predators. Losses to people are acceptable...losses to animals are not. Logically then, beavers may change the flow of streams, but Man must not. Locusts may denude hundreds of miles of plant life...but Man must not. Cougars may eat sheep and chickens, but Man must not.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Chris DeRose, Director of Last Chance for Animals, stated &quot;If the death of one rat cured all disease, it wouldn't make any difference to me.&quot; [http://www.animaluse.org/html/why_we_oppose.html] When given the choice between rescuing a human baby or a dog after a lifeboat capsized, Susan Rich, PeTA Outreach Coordinator, answered, &quot;I wouldn't know for sure... I might choose the human baby or I might choose the dog.&quot; [http://www.animaluse.org/html/why_we_oppose.html] Tom Regan, animal rights philosopher, answered &quot;If it were a retarded baby and a bright dog, I'd save the dog.&quot; [http://www.animaluse.org/html/why_we_oppose.html] Critics opposed to animal rights generally support [[animal welfare]]. [http://www.animaluse.org/html/animal_welfare.html] 

===Animal welfare as a responsiblity===
The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) has defined animal welfare as human responsibility that encompasses all aspects of animal well-being, including proper housing, management, nutrition, disease prevention and treatment, responsible care, human handling, and, when necessary, humane euthanasia. [http://www.animaluse.org/html/animal_welfare.html] 

The ''Foundation for Animal Use Education'' supports [[animal welfare]] as opposed to animal rights, arguing that: &quot;Even if we believe that animals cannot have rights, it does not mean we can treat animals any way we please. As moral agents, we recognize our own obligation to treat animals humanely &amp;mdash; not because it is their right, but because it is our responsibility.&quot; [http://www.animaluse.org/html/animal_welfare.html]

===Analogies to the Nazis===
Critics of animal rights have pointed to the support for animal rights by the [[Nazi]] regime in [[Germany]], and its anti-vivisection legislation. 

In [[1933]], a proclamation was issued by the [[NSDAP]] in Germany:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Prussian minister-president Goering has released a statement stating that starting [[16 August]] [[1933]] vivisection of animals of all kinds is forbidden in Prussia. He has requested that the concerned ministries draft a law after which vivisection will be punished with a high penalty. Until the law goes into effect, persons who, despite this prohibition, order, participate or perform vivisections on animals of any kind will be deported to concentration camps.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Among all civilized nations, Germany is thus the first to put an end to the cultural shame of vivisection! The New Germany not only frees man from the curse of materialism, sadism, and cultural Bolshevism, but gives the cruelly persecuted, tortured, and until now, wholly defenseless animals their rights. Animal friends and anti-vivisectionists of all states will joyfully welcome this action of the National Socialist government of the New Germany![http://www.hitler.org/links/NAP_5.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

An article in that same year appeared in the government-controlled publication, ''Die Weiße Fahne'', alleging that &quot;...most Germans have been raised with the attitude that animals are created by God for the use and benefit of man. The church gets this idea from the Jewish tradition.&quot;[http://www.hitler.org/links/NAP_5.html]

The argument made by critics of animal rights is that a focus on the rights of animals is consistent with a disregard for the rights of humans, because the idea of [[human rights]] is premised to a certain extent on the concept of the uniqueness of human beings. [[Gary Francione]] has produced a response to one such argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the 1930s, the Nazis certainly did show some interest in protecting animals. It is, of course, rather difficult to argue that a military force that was destroying half of Europe, including its animal population, really cared about animals, but I do not dispute that Nazis did pass fairly progressive measures against vivisection. At the same time that they were legislating to help animals, however, the Nazis were engineering the killing of millions of humans. The argument goes: there is something pathological about a society that cares about animals but not about humans, and even seeks to impose enormous suffering on at least some humans. Therefore, concern about animals must be judged against the prevailing treatment of humans, and if the latter is lesser by comparison, any concern for animal suffering is pathological.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, this argument does not work. The fact that some people may favor nonhumans greater than they do some group of human beings is not peculiar to Nazi Germany. During the 18th century, many American states passed all sorts of anticruelty laws involving animals while at the same time human slavery was legal. It is simply too easy to regard the pathology of Nazi Germany as unique in this respect. Moreover, in 1996, some people think that even more tax breaks for the rich should get greater priority than providing the minimal requirements for a decent and dignified life to disempowered and dispossessed humans. The sad fact is that humans often favor some other group of humans or animals more than they do some other human beings. But that says absolutely nothing about whether animals should have rights; it does say a lot about some people, however. [http://www.animal-law.org/commentaries/fe29.htm]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other criticisms===
British physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] has criticized activists for failing to concentrate on what he sees as more worthwhile causes: &quot;I suspect that extremists turn to animal rights from a lack of the more worthwhile causes of the past, like nuclear disarmament.” [http://www.simr.org.uk/pages/celebrity_support/professor_stephen_hawking.html]

Some critics, such as Alan Herscovici, of the Fur Council of Canada, claim that &quot;Virtually none of the money they collect is used to fund humane shelters, develop better animal husbandry methods, or find cures for diseases. Instead, donations pay the salaries of professional organizers, subsidize more fund-raising, and fuel sensationalist campaigns against animal-use industries.&quot; [http://www.maninnature.com/Management/ARights/Rights1a.html]

The animal-rights position is also criticized by some who favour animal liberation. Although he is often called the father of the modern animal-rights movement, Peter Singer actually rejects the notion of moral rights. As a utilitarian, he prefers to talk in terms of the equal consideration of interests. 
[http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/philosophy/animals/singer-text.html]

Some criticisms of the animal rights movement take the form of [[parody]], positing a &quot;vegetable rights&quot; movement. [http://www.peva.org/] [[Fruitarianism]] has adopted part of this philosophy.

==Quotes==
* &quot;A man can live and be healthy without killing animals for food; therefore, if he eats meat, he participates in taking animal life merely for the sake of his appetite. And to act so is immoral.&quot; &amp;mdash; [[Leo Tolstoy]] (''On Civil Disobedience'')

* &quot;It is my view that the vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.&quot; &amp;mdash; [[Albert Einstein]] (Letter to ''Vegetarian Watch-Tower'', [[27 December]] [[1930]])

* &quot;The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.&quot; &amp;mdash; [[Mahatma Gandhi]]

* &quot;We have enslaved the rest of the animal creation, and have treated our distant cousins in fur and feathers so badly that beyond doubt, if they were able to formulate a religion, they would depict the Devil in human form.&quot; &amp;mdash; [[William Ralph Inge]]

*&quot;The question is not can they reason, nor can they talk, but can they suffer?&quot; [[Jeremy Bentham]]

* &quot;In years of studying the (Animal Rights) mentality and engaging (activists) in debate, I have arrived at four basic characteristics that all ARAs seem to have in common. The proportions vary, of course, but all ARAs seem to have all four traits in some percentage. The four traits are as follows: Misplaced Compassion, Denial, Intellectual Laziness, and Arrogance.&quot; &amp;mdash; Ward M. Clark (''Misplaced Compassion - The Animal Rights Movement Exposed'', Writer's Club Press, 2001)

* &quot;You have just dined, and however scrupulously the slaughter-house is concealed in the graceful distance of miles, there is complicity, expensive races, -- race living at the expense of race.&quot; &amp;mdash; [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (&quot;Fate&quot;)

*&quot;As often as Herman had witnessed the slaughter of animals and fish, he always had the same thought:  in their behaviour toward creatures, all men were Nazis.  The smugness with which man could do with other species as he pleased exemplified the most extreme racist theories, the principle that might is right.&quot;  -[[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]

* &quot;The animals themselves are incapable of demanding their own liberation, or of protesting against their condition with votes, demonstrations, or bombs. Human beings have the power to continue to oppress other species forever, or until we make this planet unsuitable for living beings. Will our tyranny continue, proving that we really are the selfish tyrants that the most cynical of poets and philosophers have always said we are? Or will we rise to the challenge and prove our capacity for genuine altruism by ending our ruthless exploitation of the species in our power, not because we are forced to do so by rebels or terrorists, but because we recognize that our position is morally indefensible? The way in which we answer this question depends on the way in which each one of us, individually, answers it.&quot; -[[Peter Singer]]

* &quot;Animals do not survive by rational thought (nor by sign languages allegedly taught to them by psychologists). They survive through inborn reflexes and sensory-perceptual association. They cannot reason. They cannot learn a code of ethics. A lion is not immoral for eating a zebra (or even for attacking a man). Predation is their natural and only means of survival; they do not have the capacity to learn any other.&quot; -Edwin A. Locke (author of &quot;The Prime Movers&quot;)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:R30alex.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Alex Lifeson &lt;br /&gt;(Rush 30th Anniversary tour photo 2004)]]
'''Alexander Zivojinovich''' [[Order of Canada|OC]] (b. [[August 27]], [[1953]], [[Fernie, British Columbia]]), better known by his stage name '''Alex Lifeson''', is a Canadian musician, best known as the guitarist of [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. (&quot;Lifeson&quot; is a literal translation of &quot;Zivojinovich&quot;.)

The son of [[Serb|Serbian]] immigrants, Nenad &amp; Melka Zivojinovich, Lifeson was raised in [[Toronto, Ontario]]. Lifeson plays [[guitar]] and composes for the [[Rock (music)|rock]] group [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. He is commonly regarded as one of the most underrated rock guitarists of all time. Lifeson's solo album, ''[[Victor (album)|Victor]]'', was released in 1996. 

Outside of music, he owns and operates a small consumer-products design, engineering, and manufacturing firm [[The Omega Concern]], as a [[gourmet]] [[chef]] is part owner of the Toronto restaurant [[The Orbit Room]], and is a licensed aircraft [[Aviator|pilot]] and [[motorcycle]] operator.

Along with his colleagues [[Geddy Lee]] and [[Neil Peart]], Lifeson was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] on [[May 9]], [[1996]].  The trio were the first rock musicians so honoured.

During 2003, he played himself in an episode of the [[Canada|Canadian]] smash hit [[mockumentary]] [[Trailer Park Boys]] in which he is kidnapped by [[Robb Wells|Ricky]] as punishment for not being able to get tickets, then requested to perform a private concert back at the trailer park.  


== Tone and equipment ==

[[Image:Alex-Lifeson.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Alex Lifeson in concert with Rush.&lt;br /&gt; Milan, Italy (September 21, 2004)]]

In Rush's early career, Lifeson used a fairly standard rock rig: a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] ES-335 guitar, various [[phaser]] and [[flanger]] pedals, and a [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] &quot;Plexi&quot; amplifier.  Beginning in the late 1970s, he increasingly incorporated [[twelve-string guitar]] (acoustic and electric) and chorusing in his sound.  While [[Eddie Van Halen]] is usually credited as the inventor of the &quot;[[superstrat]],&quot; Lifeson actually adopted a key super-Strat component — the [[Floyd Rose]] locking [[vibrato]] system — before Van Halen.  By the time of the 1982 Rush album ''Signals'', Lifeson's primary guitar had become a hot-rodded Stratocaster with a [[Bill Lawrence]] high-output [[humbucker]] (a type later made famous by [[Dimebag Darrell]]) in the bridge position and a Floyd Rose bridge, and as the '80s wore on he switched from passive to active pickups and from vacuum tube to solid-state amplification, all with an increasingly thick layer of [[digital signal processing]].  (Lifeson was the primary endorser of the now all-but-forgotten [[Gallien-Krueger]] solid-state guitar amplifier line.)  In the late 1980s he switched to [[Carvin]] guitars in the studio and his short-lived Signature brand guitars onstage.

Lifeson primary used [[PRS Guitars|PRS]] guitars during the recording of ''Roll The Bones'' in 1990/1991.  When recording 1993's ''Counterparts'', Lifeson returned to rock guitar tradition: he continued to use [[PRS Guitars|PRS]] guitars and Marshall amplifiers to record the album, and for the subsequent tour.  On one ''Counterparts'' song, ''Stick It Out'', Lifeson used a [[Gibson Les Paul]] to create a deeper, more resonant tone for the song's signature riff.  He maintains this &quot;classicist&quot; stage rig today, although his signal processing chain is still so complicated as to make [[Pat Metheny]]'s processing rack or [[Robert Fripp]]'s &quot;Lunar Module&quot; look minimalist.  Lifeson currently uses PRS, [[Fender]], and Gibson guitars, and [[Hughes and Kettner]] amplifiers.  In 2005, Hughes and Kettner introduced an Alex Lifeson signature series amplifier; $50 from every amplifier sold will be donated to [[UNICEF]].

== The Naples incident ==

On [[New Year]]'s Eve 2003, Lifeson, his son, and his daughter-in-law were arrested at the Ritz Carlton hotel in [[Naples, Florida]]. Lifeson, after intervening in an altercation between his son and police, was accused of assaulting a sheriff's deputy in what was described as a drunken brawl. 

On April 21, 2005 a plea deal was met between Lifeson and the prosecution by which he would be spared a custodial sentence if he agreed to plead guilty to a single charge of resisting arrest without violence. Lifeson was required to spend 12 months on probation and to pay all court costs. 

According to the band's official website [http://www.rush.com], Lifeson is currently pursuing legal action against the Ritz Carlton and the Collier County Sheriff's Department for what he calls &quot;their incredibly discourteous, arrogant and aggressive behavior of which I had never experienced in thirty years of travel.&quot;

== Trivia ==

Bandmates often call him by his nickname, &quot;Lerxst,&quot; which also appears in a subsection of ''La Villa Strangiato'' (an instrumental based on images of Lifeson's famously vivid nightmares) from ''[[Hemispheres (1978 album)|Hemispheres]]'', titled  &quot;A Lerxst in Wonderland.&quot;

* 1991 - Inducted into the Guitar for the Practicing Musician Hall of Fame

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''ArgoUML''' is an [[open source]] application which uses the [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] to model the design of computer software.  The application runs on most platforms since it is implemented in [[Java programming language|Java]]. It is distributed under the [[BSD license]].  It provides support for all diagram types of the UML standard and includes cognitive support.

Software Development Magazine gives annual awards to popular software development tools in various categories. In 2003 ArgoUML was a finalist in the &quot;Design and Analysis Tools&quot; category. It received a runner-up award, beating many commercial tools.

Previous stable releases:
*V0.16.1 (August 2004)
*V0.18.1 (April 2005)
*V0.20   (February 2006)

New Features in V0.20:
*UML 1.4 - Enhanced extensibility features of UML 1.4 including multiple Stereotypes per ModelElement, Enumerations, and enhanced TaggedValue support. 
*Sequence Diagrams - a completely new Sequence Diagram implementation - ArgoUML now supports all diagram types
*AndroMDA compatibility - AndroMDA is an open source MDA tool which can generate code of a variety of types, up to entire applications, from the UML 1.4 models created by ArgoUML.
*Improved interoperability - this version reads and writes XMI files compatible with a wider variety of tools. UML 1.3 &amp; 1.4 using XMI 1.0, 1.1, &amp; 1.2 are read and UML 1.4/XMI 1.2 is written.
*JMI (JSR-40) support - A shiny new model subsystem using the NetBeans Model Data Repository (MDR) implementation of the Java Metadata Interface. While largely transparent to users, it will allow easier upgrades to later versions of UML.
*Quality - Hundreds of bugs have been fixed for this release.  
*Visual enhancements - a fresh new splash screen and support for Java 5 look and feel
*Most functions now support Multiple selection of modelelements. 
*Drag and Drop from the explorer tree into the diagram and within the explorer tree. 

Features from earlier versions:
*100% Java - runs on any supported Java platform - also via web start
*Free and Open Source
*Built in design critics provide unobtrusive review of design and suggestions for improvements
*Extensible modules interface - supports add-on modules such as: Java byte code reverse engineering, C#, IDL reverse engineering, Scheme scripting support, etc.
*i18n support for English, German, French, Spanish and Russian
*OCL constraints for Classes.
*code generation language support: Java, PHP, C++ and Csharp (C#)
*reverse engineering.
*class diagram auto layout
*'To do' items saved for persistent cognitive support
*PNG, GIF, JPG, SVG, EPS file generation from diagrams
*fully configurable explorer perspective configurations

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''file archiver''' combines a number of [[computer file|file]]s together into one '''archive file''', or a series of archive files, for easier transportation or storage. Many file archivers use [[lossless data compression]] in order to reduce the archive's size.

The most basic archivers just take a list of files and concatenate their contents sequentially into the archive. In addition the archive must also contain some information about at least the names and lengths of the originals, so that proper reconstruction is possible. Most archivers also store [[meta-data]] about a file that the [[operating system]] provides, such as timestamps, ownership and access control.

The process of making an archive file is called ''archiving'' or ''packing''. Reconstructing the original files from the archive is termed ''unarchiving'', ''unpacking'' or ''extracting''.

== Popular archive formats ==
Ubiquitous amongst [[Unix]] and Unix-like [[operating system]]s is the [[tar file format]] (&quot;'''t'''ape '''ar'''chive&quot;). Originally intended for transferring files to and from tape, it is still used on disk-based storage to combine files before they are compressed. Other Unix-originated formats include [[ar (Unix)|ar]] and [[shar (file format)|shar]].

On [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platforms, the most widely-used archive format by far is [[ZIP file format|ZIP]]; other popular formats are [[RAR]], [[ACE (file format)|ACE]] and [[ARJ]]. On [[Amiga]]s, the standard archive format is [[LHA (file format)|LHA]], while on Apple [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers, [[Stuffit]] is among the most common.

Unlike integrated archival and compression tools like ZIP and RAR, the [[Unix]] tools '''ar''', '''tar''', '''cpio''' (for &quot;archiver&quot;, &quot;tape archiver, and &quot;copy in/out&quot;, respectively) act as archivers but not compressors. Users of the Unix tools typically add compression by compressing the result of packing (and uncompressing before unpacking), most often using the [[gzip]] or [[bzip2]] programs. In fact modern '''tar''' programs include an option to automatically call a (de)compression program, so that it looks just as if tar itself could handle compressed archives. This approach has two advantages:

*It follows the [[Unix philosophy|Unix toolbox]] concept that each program should accomplish a ''single'' but well-done task. Once a better compressor is developed, users may use that immediately, without having to give up their archiver.
*Since the whole archive is compressed, redundancy between archived files can be detected and eliminated. An archiver compressing each archived file in isolation cannot exploit these inter-file redundancy.

Its main disadvantage is that extracting one file from a compressed archive requires all the files before it to be decompressed, which may take many minutes for a large archive. Altering the underlying archive is even more inconvenient, requiring the entire file to be uncompressed, altered and then recompressed. Archivers with integrated compression perform these operations much more quickly.

[[Image:Diane_de_Versailles_Leochares.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The &quot;Artemis of Versailles&quot;, a Roman copy of a [[Hellenistic]] marble sculpture, now at the [[Louvre Museum]].]]

[[Greek mythology]] '''Artemis''' ([[World Book]] ''«AHR tuh mihs»'') (Greek '''{{unicode|&amp;#x1F08;}}ρτεμις''') is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]] and the twin sister of [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]].  In later times she was conflated with the [[goddess]] [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]] of [[Roman mythology]].  In [[Etruscan mythology]], she took the form of [[Artume]].

== Worship ==
[[Image:Temple_of_Artemis.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Temple of Artemis, engraving by [[Martin Heemskerck]].]]
{{Greek myth (Olympian)}}
She was the virgin [[moon goddess]] of the hunt, wild animals, healing, wilderness, chastity, and [[childbirth]].  She was worshipped as a fertility/childbirth goddess in many places since, according to some myths, she assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin.  At some point in the [[classical antiquity|Classical period]], she was identified by some with [[Hecate]], the primal, pre-Olympian feral goddess.  She much later became more identified with and eventually supplanted [[Selene]] as the [[moon goddess]] to complement her twin's identification with and supplantation of [[Helios]] as the [[sun god]].  Artemis also assimilated [[Caryatis]] ([[Carya]]).

Her priestesses were addressed with the title [[Melissa]], which means &quot;honey bee&quot;.

Artemis was not worshipped heavily in much of mainland [[Greece]].  In [[Asia Minor]], however, she was a principal deity. The city of Ephesus is probably the best known of the Asian centers of her worship, from the story in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], where the Ephesian metalsmiths who feel threatened by Paul's preaching of the new faith, zealously riot in her defense, shouting &quot;Great is Diana of the Ephesians!&quot; (''Acts 19:28'' KJV) In [[Roman Empire|Rome]], she was heavily venerated at [[Mount Tifata]] near [[Capua]] and in holy forests (such as [[Aricia]], [[Latium]])  Her high priest lived in Aricia; his position was passed to the person who was able to kill him with a bough, picked from a tree in the forest.

Festivals in honor of Artemis include [[Brauronia]], held in [[Brauron]] and the festival of [[Artemis Orthia]] in [[Sparta]].

Young girls were initiated into the cult of Artemis at puberty.  However, before marrying (an event in which they had little say, and which occurred shortly after puberty), they were asked to lay all the accoutrements of virginity (toys, dolls, locks of their hair) on an altar to Artemis.

=== Diana ===
Diana was worshipped in a temple on the [[Aventine Hill]] where mainly lower-class citizens and slaves worshipped her.  Slaves could ask for and receive asylum in her temples.

She was worshipped at a festival on [[August 13]].

Her name may have come from ''diviana'' (&quot;the shining one&quot;).

It is often presumed that defeated peoples become a substratum beneath that of their conquerors.  It seems plausible that the association of Diana worship with slaves may reflect the conquest of Goddess worshippers by, presumably, the early Romans.

=== Artemis in art ===
[[Image:Statue_of_Artemis_Ephesus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Statue of Artemis, [[Ephesus]], [[Turkey]].]]

In art, she was typically portrayed with a crescent moon above her head and her bow and arrows, created by [[Hephaestus]] and the [[Cyclopes]].  These arrows, in contrast to her role as goddess of childbirth, were said to be the cause of women dying in childbirth.  Her brother [[Apollo]] exhibited contradiction as well, as he was a god of healing who brought [[leprosy]], [[rabies]] and [[gout]].

[[Image:Artemis breasts.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Closeup of statue of Artemis from Asia Minor, now in the [[Vatican Museums]], [[Rome]].]]

In [[Ephesus]], the [[Temple of Artemis]] became one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]].  In Ephesus, and elsewhere in Asia Minor, she was worshipped primarily as an earth and fertility goddess, akin to [[Cybele]], unlike in mainland Greece.  Statues in Greece depict her with her bow and arrow. In Asia Minor, she was often depicted with multiple rounded protuberances on her chest. They were formerly believed to be multiple breasts but are now known to have represented bull testes (''see right'').

=== Appellations ===
As [[Agrotora]], she was especially associated as the patron goddess of hunters.  Artemis was often associated with the local [[Aegina|Aeginian]] goddess, [[Aphaea]].  As [[Potnia|Potnia Theron]], she was the patron of wild animals; [[Homer]] used this title.  As [[Kourotrophos]], she was the nurse of youths. As [[Locheia]], she was the goddess of childbirth and midwives.  She was sometimes known as Cynthia, from her birthplace on [[Mount Cynthus]] on [[Delos]].  She sometimes used the name [[Phoebe]], the feminine form of her brother, Apollo's, [[Phoebus]].

== Birth ==
In Greek mythology Artemis is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin sister of [[Apollo]]. [[Leto]] had to find a place where the sun had never shone to give birth to the two due to a curse set by [[Hera]], [[Zeus]]' wife.  For this, [[Zeus]] rose an island that had been floating underwater and not yet touched by the sun. The island was [[Delos]], and [[Leto]] gave birth there. Artemis was born first and then assisted Leto in the birth of her brother.  Artemis and [[Apollo]] were born greater than any of [[Hera]]'s children.

== Childhood ==
At three years old, Artemis asked her father, Zeus, while sitting on the god king's knee, to grant her several wishes. She asked for perpetual virginity, lop-eared hounds, does to lead her chariot, and [[nymph]]s as her hunting companions.  He granted her wishes.  All of her companions remained virgins, and she guarded her chastity very closely.

== Tales of Artemis and Men ==
[[Image:Adonis3.jpg|thumb|[[Adonis]].]]
=== Actaeon ===
She was once bathing nude in the woods when the Theban prince and hunter [[Actaeon]] stumbled across her.  He stopped and stared, amazed at her ravishing beauty.  He was so stunned that he accidentally stepped on a twig, and Artemis noticed him.  She was so disgusted at his stares that she changed him to a stag and set his own hounds to kill him.  He was torn apart by the deadly hunting dogs, who never knew that the stag they were hunting was their own master.  Alternatively, Actaeon boasted that he was a better hunter than she and Artemis turned him into a stag and he was eaten by his hounds.

=== Adonis ===
In some versions of the story of [[Adonis]], Artemis or [[Ares]] (her lover in this story) sent a wild boar to kill Adonis.  This version is suspect because it implies that Artemis had lain with Ares and by virtually all accounts, she remained chaste throughout time.

=== Siproites ===
A Cretan, Siproites, saw Artemis bathing nude and was changed by her into a woman.  (The complete story does not survive in any mythographer's works, but is mentioned offhand by [[Antoninus Liberalis]].)

=== Orion ===
After leaving Eos, [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]] became a follower of Artemis.  She eventually killed him, though the reasons given vary:
#Orion and Artemis were engaged.  Her brother, [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] didn't believe it was appropriate for her to marry a mortal.  Apollo convinced Orion to walk out into the water and then dared Artemis to try to hit the barely visible speck (actually Orion's head) with an arrow from the shore.  She succeeded, killing him.
#Orion raped one of Artemis' female followers.  She sent [[Scorpio]], a [[scorpion]], to kill him and both were placed in the stars as [[constellation]]s.  This legend explains why the constellation Scorpio rises just after Orion begins to set -- the scorpion still chases him.  Orion's dog became [[Sirius]], the dog-star.
#Artemis was in love with Orion. She was very happy with him and spent many of her days hunting with him. Apollo, her brother got jealous that she was paying more attention to Orion than him, so he came up with a plan to get rid of him. He sent a giant scorpion to kill Orion, but Artemis put him on an island where the scorpian could not get to him. Apollo challenged Artemis saying that she could not hit that rock way out in the distance. when Orions dead ody floated to the shore,Artemis weeped for days. She sent his body, and his hunting dog to the stars and they became the constellations Orion and the dog star Sirius. the Scorpian became the constellation Scorpio.

== Other stories ==
=== Callisto ===
[[Image:Tizian 015.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Tizian]]'s ''Diana and Callisto'']]Artemis killed any of her companions who lost their virginity, such as [[Maera]] and [[Callisto the Greek myth|Callisto]].

One of Artemis' companions, [[Callisto the Greek myth|Callisto]], lost her virginity to Zeus, who had come disguised as Artemis.  Enraged, Artemis changed her into a bear.  Callisto's son, [[Arcas]], nearly killed his mother while hunting, but Zeus or Artemis stopped him and placed them both in the sky as [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor]].

=== Agamemnon and Iphigenia ===
Artemis punished [[Agamemnon]] after he killed a sacred deer in a sacred grove and boasted he was a better hunter.  On his way to [[Troy]] to participate in the [[Trojan War]], Agamemnon's ships were suddenly motionless as Artemis stopped the wind.  An [[oracle]] named [[Calchis]] told Agamemnon that the only way to appease Artemis was to sacrifice [[Iphigenia]], his daughter.  According to some versions, he did so, but others claims that he sacrificed a deer in her place and Iphigenia was taken to [[Crimea]] to prepare others for sacrifice to Artemis.

=== Niobe ===
A Queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]], [[Niobe]] boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two.  Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, with the last begging for his life, and Artemis her daughters.  Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after stating he would get revenge.  A grief-stricken Niobe fled to [[Mount Siplyon]] in [[Asia Minor]] and turned into stone as she cried, or killed herself.  Her tears made the river [[Achelous]].  Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the 9th day after their death, when the gods themselves buried them.

=== Taygete ===
[[Zeus]] pursued [[Taygete]], one of the [[Pleiades (mythology)|Pleiades]], who prayed to Artemis.  The goddess turned Taygete into a doe but Zeus raped her when she was unconscious.  She thus conceived [[Lacedaemon]], the mythical founder of [[Sparta]].

=== Otus and Ephialtes ===
[[Aloadae|Otus]] and [[Ephialtes]] were a pair of brothers and giants.  At one point, they wanted to storm [[Mt. Olympus]].  They managed to kidnap [[Ares]] and hold him in a jar for thirteen months. He was only released when Artemis offered to sleep with Otus. This made Ephialtes envious and the pair fought. Artemis changed herself into a doe and jumped between them. The [[Aloadae]], not wanting her to get away, threw their spears and killed each other.

=== The Meleagrids ===
After the death of [[Meleager]], Artemis turned her grieving sisters, the [[Meleagrids]] into [[guineafowl]].

=== Chione ===
Artemis killed [[Chione]] for her pride and vanity.

=== Atalanta and Oeneus ===
Artemis saved the infant [[Atalanta]] from dying of exposure after her father abandoned her.  She sent a female bear to suckle the baby, who was then raised by hunters.

Among other adventures, Atalanta participated in the hunt for the [[Calydonian Boar]], which Artemis had sent to destroy [[Calydon]] because King [[Oeneus]] had forgotten her at the harvest sacrifices.

=== Camilla ===
Queen [[Camilla]] was a follower of Artemis who was killed in battle by a man named Arruns. Soon after Camilla's death, a nymph in Artemis' train shot and killed the man with an arrow, avenging the dead huntress.

== Artemis in Neopaganism ==
Many [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]], particularly ''Hellenistic'' [[sect]]s in the [[United States]], that worship Artemis today seem to omit many of the ancient myths. Those myths which are accepted by modern [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] seem to be interpreted rather abstractly, as mostly metaphor. Artemis is believed to be rather concerned with her follower's well being, but to reserve her boons to those who respect nature.

Artemis, in modern worship, is often seen as the goddess of wealth, magic, abundance, fertility, hunting, and longevity. While many who practice magic worship [[Hecate]] more favor Artemis for her supposed benevolence. Worship of Artemis may often include the burning of oils and incense, prayer, ritual nocturnal hunts, the burning of bread, and prostration. Artemis is thought to grant numerous boons and blessings on her followers, and is commonly worshipped by both men and women.

[[Artemis Fowl]] is a book series by the same name, referencing some of the details mentioned in this article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Camp ArbeitMachtFrei.JPG|thumb|''Arbeit Macht Frei'' gate at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|KZ Sachsenhausen]]]]

&quot;'''''Arbeit macht frei'''''&quot; is a [[German language|German]] phrase meaning &quot;work brings freedom&quot; or &quot;work shall make you free&quot;. It is probably derived from [[Gospel of John|John]] 8:32 in [[The Bible]], &quot;the truth shall make you free&quot; and from there, via the [[Protestant work ethic]], developed into a German and Swiss-German [[peasant]] saying. 

In 1872, the German-nationalist author [[Lorenz Diefenbach]] used it as a title for a novel, which caused it to become well-known in nationalist circles. It was adopted by the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar government]] in 1928 as a slogan describing the effects of their desired policy of large-scale public work programmes to end unemployment. It was continued in this usage by the [[NSDAP]] when it came into power in 1933.

As either a sign of contempt for Judaic culture or as an ironic joke or satire, or a way of instilling false hope, this slogan was placed at the entrances of a number of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s. Although it was common practice in [[Germany]] to post inscriptions of this sort at the entrances to institutional properties or large estates, the use of the slogan in this particular way was ordered by SS General [[Theodor Eicke]], inspector of the concentration camps and first commandant of [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. The slogan can still be seen at several sites, including those at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz I]] (although according to ''Auschwitz: A New History'' by BBC historian Laurence Rees, it was placed at this location by commandant Rudolf Höss who believed that doing menial work when he had been imprisoned during the Weimar Republic had helped him through the experience), [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Gross-Rosen]], [[Sachsenhausen (detention camp)|Sachsenhausen]], and the [[Concentration camp Theresienstadt|Theresienstadt]] Ghetto-Camp (at [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], however, &quot;'''''[[Jedem das Seine]]'''''&quot; was used instead; which translates to &quot;To each his own&quot;).

[[Image:Terezin.ArbeitMachtFrei.JPG|thumb|''Arbeit Macht Frei'' at concentration camp [[Terezin]] in the Czech Republic.]]

As a consequence, this saying has acquired very negative and sinister undertones in much of the western world.

In [[1938]], the [[Austria]]n political cabaret writer [[Jura Soyfer]] and the composer [[Herbert Zipper]], then both prisoners at [[Dachau concentration camp]], wrote the ''Dachaulied'', the Dachau song. They had spent weeks marching in and out of the gates of the camp to forced work every day, and considered the motto &quot;Arbeit macht frei&quot; above the gates as an insult. The song repeats the phrase cynically as a &quot;lesson&quot; taught by Dachau. The first verse is translated in the article on Jura Soyfer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Axayacatl''' (pron. {ah-sha-ya-ka'-tl} - the name means &quot;Water-mask&quot; or &quot;Water-face&quot;) was an [[Aztec]] ruler ([[Tlatoani]]) of the city of [[Tenochtitlán]] from [[1469]] to [[1481]].

He is chiefly remembered for subjugating [[Tlatelolco]], Tenochtitlán's sister city, in [[1473]]. Using as a pretext the insulting behavior of a few Tlatelolcan citizens, he invaded his neighbor, killed its ruler, [[Moqui-huix]], and replaced him with a military governor. The Tlatelolcans lost any voice they had in forming Aztec policy.

He was preceded on the throne by [[Moctezuma I]] and followed by his brother [[Tizoc|Tízoc]] in [[1481]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Auítzotl''' (sometimes rendered as '''Ahuitzotl''' or Axayacatl) was the eighth  [[Aztec]] ruler, the ''Chief Speaker'',  of the city of [[Tenochtitlán]].  He was responsible for the expansion of the Mexica domain, and consolidated the empire's power after a weak performance by his predecessor.  He took power as [[Tlatoani]] in [[1486]], after his predecessor [[Tízoc]] was poisoned. 

Perhaps the greatest known military leader of [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], Auítzotl began his reign by suppressing a [[Huastec]] rebellion, and then swiftly more than doubled the size of lands under Aztec dominance.  He conquered the [[Mixtec]], [[Zapotec]], and other peoples from Mexico's Pacific coast down to the western part of [[Guatemala]].  Auitzotl also supervised a major rebuilding of Tenochtitlán on a grander scale including the expansion of the Great Pyramid or [[Templo Mayor]].  He ordered over 20,000 people to be sacrificed in the dedication of the Great Pyramid.

Auitzotl was the third son of Lord [[Moctezuma I]] (also found as Motecuhzome and Ilhuicamina), who was the fifth Chief Speaker.  He was succeeded in [[1502]] by his son, [[Moctezuma II]] (the famous &quot;Montezuma&quot; humiliated by [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés]]).  A second son, [[Cuitláhuac]], was the tenth true Chief Speaker.   

The Aztec king [[Ahuitzotl]] took the [[Ahuizotl (creature)|Ahuizotl]] as his [[mascot]], but it appears the Aztecs thought of it as a creature in its own right, and not merely a mythical beast representing the king.

'''Albinism''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''albus'', meaning &quot;white&quot;) is a lack of [[pigment|pigmentation]] in the eyes, skin and hair. It is an inherited condition resulting from the combination of [[recessive allele]]s passed from both parents of an individual. This condition is known to affect mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. While the most common term for an individual affected by albinism is &quot;albino&quot;, some of them prefer &quot;person with albinism&quot;, because &quot;albino&quot; is often used in a derogatory way. A humorous compensation for this was the invention of the word &quot;pigmento&quot; for a normally pigmented person.
The gene which results in albinism prevents the body from making the usual amounts of a [[pigment]] called [[melanin]]. Albinism used to be categorised as [[Tyrosinase]] positive or negative. In cases of Tyrosinase positive albinism, the [[enzyme]] tyrosinase is present but is unable to enter [[melanocyte|pigment cells]] to produce melanin. In tyrosinase negative cases, this enzyme is not produced. This classification has been rendered obsolete by recent research. 

About 1 in 17,000 people have some type of albinism, although up to 1 in 70 are carriers. 

There are many alterations of [[genes]] which are proven to be associated with albinism. All alterations, however, lead to an alteration of the melanin (pigment/coloring) production in the body. [[Melanin]] helps protect the [[skin]] from [[ultraviolet]] [[light]] coming from the [[sun]] (see [[human skin color]] for more information). Organisms with albinism lack this protective pigment in their skin, and can burn easily from exposure to the sun as a result. Lack of melanin in the eye also results in problems with vision unrelated to [[photosensitivity]], which are discussed further below.

There are two main categories of albinism in humans: oculocutaneous and ocular. In ocular albinism, only the eyes lack pigment. In oculocutaneous pigment is missing from the hair, eyes, and skin. People who have ocular albinism have normal skin/hair color and many have normal eye color. People with oculocutaneous albinism can have no pigment to almost normal. Some may even tan.

The eyes of a person with albinism occasionally appear red due to the underlying blood vessels showing through where there is not enough pigment to cover them. In humans this is rarely the case, as a human eye is quite large and thus produces enough pigment to lend opacity to the eye. However, there are cases in which the eyes appear red or purple, depending on the amount of pigment present. 

People with albinism are generally as healthy as the rest of their species, with growth and development occurring as normal. Many animals with albinism, however, lose their protective camouflage and are unable to conceal themselves from their predators or prey. The survivability rate of animals with albinism in the wild is usually quite low. The largest problem people with albinism face is social, as the condition is sometimes a source of teasing during adolescent years. 

As albinism is a recessive gene, the chance of offspring with albinism resulting from the pairing of a creature with albinism with a creature without albinism is very low and is discussed below.

===Types of albinism===
There are many types of albinism. While there is only one type of ocular albinism, there are at least five types of oculocutaneous albinism, one of which has several subtypes. Some are easily distinguished by appearance, but in most cases, genetic testing is the only way to be sure. Apart from HPS (see below) testing has no medical benefits. 

* The type with the usually least amount of pigment is '''OCA1''' ({{OMIM|203100}}). People with this type usually have very white skin, white hair and light blue eyes, however there are cases in which the eyes appear red or purple, depending on the amount of pigment present.. OCA1 is caused by an alteration of the tyrosinase gene, and can occur in two variations. The first is OCA1A, and means that the organism cannot develop pigment at all. Vision usually ranges from 20/200 to 20/400.  The second is OCA1b, which has several subtypes itself. Many individuals with OCA1b can tan and develop pigment. One subtype of OCA1b is called OCA1b TS (Temperature Sensitive), where the [[tyrosinase]] can only function below a certain temperature, which causes the body hair in cooler body regions to develop pigment (i.e. get darker).

* The most common type of albinism is '''OCA2''' ({{OMIM|203200}}), which is caused by alterations of the P-gene. People with OCA2 generally have more pigment, and better vision than those with OCA1, but cannot tan like some with OCA1b. A little pigment can develop in freckles or moles. People with OCA2 usually have fair skin but not as white as OCA1, and light to golden or reddish blonde hair, and usually blue eyes. Affected people of African decent usually have a different phenotype (appearance): Yellow hair, rather white skin and blue, gray or hazel eyes.

* '''OCA3''' or Rufuous (=Red) Albinism ({{OMIM|203290}}) has only been partially researched and documented. Cases have been reported in Africa and New Guinea, affected individuals have red hair and reddish brown skin and blue or gray eyes. 

* '''HPS''' or '''Hermansky-Pudlak-Syndrome''' ({{OMIM|203300}}) is not a type of OCA itself, but has similar features. HPS has a great range of degrees of pigmentation, from OCA1A-like to almost normal. Vision usually ranges  from 20/60 to 20/200. Apart from the hypopigmentation and impaired vision, people with HPS have an abnormality in their blood platelets, which usually leads to bleeding issues and bruising easily, and people with HPS often suffer from lung fibrosis (scarring of the lung) and other sicknesses. HPS is very rare. 

* '''Ocular albinism''' ('''OA1''') ({{OMIM|300500}}) affects only the eyes, and occurs primarily in males, as it is [[X-linked]] inherited. Nonetheless, skin color can be slightly lighter than those of the rest of the family, or &quot;normal&quot;. The eye color can vary greatly, in which case only examination of the retina can reveal OA1.

==Visual problems associated with albinism==
Eye conditions common in albinism include (not all will necessarily be present)

* [[Nystagmus]], irregular rapid movement of the eyes back and forth.
* [[Strabismus]], muscle imbalance of the eyes (&quot;crossed eyes&quot; or &quot;lazy eye&quot;)
* Sensitivity to bright light and glare.
* Far- or Near-sightedness
* [[Astigmatism]] (distortion of a viewed image, usually either horizontally or vertically)
* Abnormal routing of the [[optic nerve]] to the brain

People with albinism suffer from impaired vision, but the degree varies greatly. While a person with albinism may suffer from a standard eye affliction like [[near-sightedness]] or [[far-sightedness]], the biggest problem arises from a poorly-developed [[retina]] and abnormal nerve connections between the eyes and brain. These abnormalities ''define'' albinism, medically. While the  effects of this condition are difficult to describe, it can be explained as seeing at a lower resolution.  Additionally, most people with albinism suffer from [[nystagmus]] (a rapid, involuntary &quot;shaking&quot; of the eyes) which further reduces vision. People with albinism are also likely to have [[astigmatism]] or [[strabismus]]. 

The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], the colored area in the center of the eye, does not have enough pigment to screen out stray light coming into the eye. Light normally enters the eye only through the pupil, the dark opening in the center of the iris, but in albinism light can pass through the iris as well. Such sensitivity generally leads to a dislike of bright lights, but does not prevent people with albinism enjoying the outdoors, especially when using sunglasses and/or hats. They should avoid prolonged exposure to bright sunlight regardless, as their skin is particularly susceptible to [[sunburn]] (see below).

===Sun Protection and Vision Aids===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Child OCA sunprotection.jpg|thumb|right|Child with OCA, enjoying the outdoors with sunglasses and hat]] --&gt;
Albinism is a condition that cannot be &quot;cured&quot; or &quot;treated&quot; per se, but small things can be done to improve the quality of life for those affected. It is vital that people with albinism use sunscreen when exposed to sunlight to prevent premature skin aging or [[skin cancer]]. This poses a big problem for those who cannot afford sunscreen, especially in countries with high exposure to sunlight, as in Africa. Special UV-proof clothing and swimsuits are available and are a good alternative to excessive use of sunscreen.

For the most part, treatment of the eye conditions consists of visual rehabilitation. Surgery to correct strabismus may improve the appearance of the eyes. However, since surgery will not correct the misrouting of nerves from the eyes to the brain, surgery will not provide fine binocular vision. In the case of esotropia or &quot;crossed eyes,&quot; surgery may help vision by expanding the visual field (the area that the eyes can see while looking at one point).

Glasses and low-visual aids such as magnifiers, large print materials or CCTVs ([[closed-circuit television]]), as well as bright but angled reading lights can help individuals with albinism, even if their vision cannot be corrected completely. Some people do well using bifocals which have a strong reading lens, prescription reading glasses, or contact lenses. Others use hand-held magnifiers or special small telescopes. Some use bioptics, glasses which have small telescopes mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses, so that they can look through either the regular lens or the telescope. Newer designs of bioptics use smaller light-weight lenses. Some states allow the use of bioptic telescopes for driving. (See also NOAH bulletin &quot;Low Vision Aids.)  

Although still disputed among the experts, many ophthalmologists recommend the use of glasses from early childhood on to allow the eyes the best development possible. Surgery is possible on the ocular muscles to decrease nystagmus, strabismus and common refractive errors, but especially with nystagmus surgery the effectiveness varies greatly and depends on individual circumstances.

[[Optometry|Optometrists]] or [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]] who are experienced in working with low vision patients can recommend various optical aids. Clinics should provide aids on trial loan, and provide instruction in their use. The American Foundation for the Blind (1-800-AFB-LIND) maintains a directory of low vision clinics.

Use of sunglasses and hats with wide brims can make the glare outside bearable. Other things that can help people with albinism are avoiding sudden changes of the lighting situation (switching the light on in complete darkness), using dimmable switches and adding tint to car windows or blinds to normal windows. Lights should be yellowish rather than blue and not point towards the usual position of a person with albinism (like their seat at a table). When possible, people with albinism prefer to have the light on their backs rather than face it.

==Culture==
===Myths and Superstitions===
Due to albinism's effect on one's outward appearance, cultures around the world have developed many myths and superstitions regarding people with albinism.

[[Zimbabwe]] has developed a myth that having [[sex]] with a woman with albinism will cure a man of [[HIV]]. This has led to many women with albinism in the area being raped [http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=14122].

In [[Jamaica]], West Indies, people with albinism have been degraded and regarded as cursed.  In recent times, the affected [[dancehall]] singer [[Yellowman]] has helped to end this stereotype.

In some cultures, people with albinism are thought to have [[magical]] powers or are able to tell the future.

It is also thought by many that people with albinism live short life spans.  This is not true, and may be a distorted view of a more reasonable fact that people with albinism have a higher risk of skin cancer if they do not use proper skin protection  when in the sun.

===Other===
[[Bristol Zoo]] was the home to a very rare albino [[African penguin]] named Snowdrop. Snowdrop was hatched at the zoo in October 2002 and died in August 2004. For many years, a unique albino [[gorilla]] named [[Floquet de Neu]] (Snowflake) was the most famous resident of the Parc Zoològic de [[Barcelona]]. An albino [[humpback whale]] travels up and down the east coast of Australia, and has become famous in the local media.  The whale is called Migaloo (the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word for &quot;white lad&quot;).

Medical science and [[toxicology]] can take advantage of the standardized lack of pigment in albino animals in testing for materials' chemical properties. An example of such a test is the test for corrosiveness, which is a skin exposure test performed on albino rabbits.

The [[2004]] book [[Weird U.S.]] chronicled (and further popularized) one of the lesser known &quot;local myths&quot; of the country, Albino Colonies. The book uses firsthand accounts mailed to the authors to paint a picture of various locations in the [[U.S.]] (most notably [[Clifton, New Jersey]]) where colonies of albino families and neighbors live in seclusion. The accounts tell tales of honking horns to try to bring the albinos out of their houses, being shot at with [[rock salt]] by albinos, and even [[vigilante|vigilantism]] by gangs of albinos.

'''Amr Abdel Basset Abdel Aziz Diab''' ([[October 11]], [[1961]] in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]]). Known as Amr Diab, is one of the most successful singers in the [[Arab]] world.

==Biography==
Amr Diab was born in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]] into an artistic family. His father, Abdul Basset Diab, worked for the Suez Canal Corporation where he was chairman of Marine Construction and Shipbuilding. He possessed a fine singing voice and encouraged the young Amr to sing.

One evening, when Amr was just six years old, his father took him to the [[July 23]] Festival at Port Said There they visited the local broadcasting station and Amr made his first singing appearance on Egyptian Radio performing the National Anthem &quot;Biladi, Biladi&quot;. He was praised by the Governor of Port Said who awarded him with a guitar as a prize.

In due course Amr began his musical studies at the music faculty of the Cairo Academy of Art and from which he graduated in 1986. His first album &quot;Ya Tareeq&quot; followed shortly. It was an instant success. There have been, since then, a further 16 top selling albums in a prolific recording career which has established him as the super-star of the Arab world.

Amr has toured widely throughout his career organizing galas and performing concerts in countries as far flung as Australia, Canada, Europe &amp; the USA.

In 1990 Amr was chosen to represent Egypt at the 5th Tournament of African Sports where he sang in English and French as well as Arabic. This concert was televised by satellite throughout the Arab world and highlighted on CNN. He became the first Arab artist to make a video clip and in a parallel career, has acted in several films including &quot;Deahk We La'ab&quot; (Laughter &amp; Fun), a film which opened the Egyptian Film Festival in 1993. In this film, directed by Tarek Al Telmasani, Amr played opposite the world famous Egyptian actor Omar Sharif. In the film &quot;Ice Cream in Gleem&quot; directed by Khairi Bishara, Amr played the role of the main hero. 
The singer has already been the subject of three biographies – Amr Diab, the owner of my heart, The Rebellious and Amr Diab, Star of the 20th Century. His nickname is Rebellious – due, it is said, to comparisons made with his contemporaries, in all aspects of life - his clothes, hairstyling, the performance and execution of his music, the melodies he composes and his many appearances at parties.

Amr became known for the new 'style' of his music which the Arabs came to call &quot;Mediterranean Music&quot; referring to its blend of Western and Arabic rhythms. He was named, by most satellite and TV stations, as the Best Singer in the Arab World throughout the nineties and continually sets new Arabic sales records with successive album releases. 

1996 witnessed the release of &quot;Nour El Ain&quot; (Light Of The Eye – Sight) which was a tremendous success not only in the Middle East but throughout the entire world. The title track, and its English version &quot;Habibi&quot;, was an international phenomenon, becoming a massive crossover hit in countries as far afield as India, Pakistan, Argentina, Chile, France and South Africa. The song was remixed by several top European arrangers and has become a big pull on the dance floors of Europe. The video clip, also produced by Alam El Phan for the song &quot;Nour El Ain&quot;, was one of the most lavish and expensive productions in the field of Arab song, and set a new standard for his contemporaries to aspire to. &quot;Nour El Ain&quot; has become the best selling album ever released by an Arabic artist.

In 1997 Amr Diab won three Awards at the Annual Arabic Festival (for Best Video, Best Song and Artist of the Year). 
In the following year, he received a Triple Platinum Award for the sales of &quot;Nour El Ain&quot;, and received the Worldwide Music Award in Monaco on [[6 May]] [[1998]], under the patronage of H.S.H. Prince Albert of Monaco, and attended by such International luminaries as Gloria Estefan, Céline Dion, Mariah Carey, The Backstreet Boys, Steven Segal and many more. This award was the first of its kind for an Arabic artist, emphasising that his appeal is not just confined to the Middle East unlike the majority of his contemporaries.

His follow-up studio album entitled &quot;Awedooni&quot; was released in July 1998, and as for &quot;Nour El Ain&quot; it was produced with Hamid El Shary and recorded in Cairo, Egypt. The first video from the album, the title track &quot;Awedooni&quot;, was shot by the river Nile in Egypt and directed by Tareq Al Aryan. Like its predecessor this album was a huge success for Amr and reinforced his popularity in the Arab world and abroad.

The &quot;Best of Amr Diab&quot; released in early 1999 contained a brand new song &quot;Maham Kibirt Sugheir&quot; recorded as a tribute to the Legends of Arabic music such as Omm Kolsoum, Abdel Halim Hafez and Mohammed Abdul Wahab that have influenced him. A strong ballad with a spectacular video of the concert footage inspired by Puff Daddy (who he met at the Monaco Awards) it became another big hit for Amr. The album also contains a previously unreleased European remix of Habibi, and the most popular songs from Amr's albums of the 1990s.
July 1999 sees the release of Amr's new studio album &quot;Amarain&quot;, (two moons) already hailed as the best work of his career to date and including the eagerly anticipated duets with the France based international Rai superstar, Khaled of &quot;Didi&quot; fame, and with the Greek diva, Angela Dimitrou, whose crossover smash &quot;Marguerites&quot; was a huge hit across the Middle East in 1998. The title track Amarain is the first video to be broadcast and the album seems certain to confirm Amr's position as the leading and most innovative artist from the Middle East. 

“Tamally Ma'ak” (Always With You) came next, which was released on[[17 July]] [[2000]], and achieved a high level of popularity and success. The title track’s video, Tamally Ma’ak, which was shot in the Czech Republic, was considered one of the best videos for Amr Diab. Again he appeared with a new look and a new style!

On [[1 August]] [[2001]], and after a great anticipation by the huge number of fans, &quot;Aktar Wahed&quot; was released. The album's name is a short for one of the songs &quot;Aktar Wahed Beyhebbak&quot;. It contains 10 tracks and a bonus oriental remix for the song &quot;Wala Ala Balo&quot;. &quot;Wala Ala Balo&quot;, a well-studied mash up of both Trance/Techno rhythms and Oriental Arabic Music. The song featured the rapper SandMan. The video on the other hand was shot in London in a discotheque. An even newer style for Amr Diab The album contains a good number of significant songs like &quot;Adeeni Rege'telek&quot;, &quot;Ya Habeeby La&quot;, &quot;Sadda'ni Khalas&quot; and &quot;Ba'edd Ellayali&quot;.

Later in 2003, Amr released &quot;Allem Alby&quot; (Teach My Heart). The Album's release date was arranged to be with the debut broadcast of Alam El Phan's (Allem Alby's Production Company, Owned by Mohsen Gaber) music channel &quot;Mazzika&quot;.
The album was a great success, with the release of the video &quot;Ana Ayesh&quot; which was directed by Stuart Gosling. The video was intensely broadcasted on Mazzika . The album contains other good songs, like the album-titled &quot;Allem Alby&quot; which is a solid R&amp;B influenced hit. Others that tend to be more oriental like &quot;Kollohomm&quot; and &quot;Law Ash'any&quot;.

As most of the US and International populations have seen the Pepsi commercial which brings 3 important icons in Pop Music together; Beyoncé Knowles, Pink and Britney Spears. In the US version, Enrique Iglesias takes the role of the Cesar. But in the pan Arab version, the three American divas were maintained but the male figure was replaced with Amr Diab. This was not the first Pepsi Commercial Amr Diab has done. He did one using his song &quot;Allem Alby&quot;.

In between 2003 and 2004, and after a long successful career with Alam El Phan, Amr Diab was officially announced the termination of his contract with Mohsen Gaber (owner of Alam El Phan). Rumors were spread around about the tense situation going on between Gaber and Diab. Since they've been known as good friends, it was a bit of a surprise. Then other rumors circulated that Saudi Prince Waleed Bin Talal (owner of [[Rotana]]) has lured Amr with offering a better deal.

In late summer of 2004, Amr's first album with [[Rotana]] was released, titled &quot;Leily Nahari&quot; (My Nights, -are- My Days) but it refers more that he's been up all his nights because his beloved is far away. The album's cover was from the promotional photo shoot of Pepsi, but the album was brand new. The video &quot;Leily Nahari&quot; directed by Casey Cameron was a great aid to give Amr his space in the record-exclusive music channels. Still, it was a bit criticized to be similar to his Previously Unreleased video of &quot;El Alem Allah&quot; from the album &quot;Tamally Ma'ak&quot;.

Most of his albums so far had met wide popularity all over the Arab world and even globally. 

He also won the world music award twice as the best selling middle eastern Artist in 2002 and 1998

He also obtained many local and international prizes in song festivals, including his song [[Nour El Ain]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[Belgium|Belgian]] [[hip hop music]]''' has a few [[rapper]]s stemming from [[Africa]]. [[Belgium]], like [[France]] controlled [[Africa]]n countries like the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly Zaire), [[Rwanda]], and [[Burundi]] until the early [[1960s]]. Like France, [[Immigration|immigrant]]s from these countries started to study and live in Belgium. 

The Belgian hip hop scene started in the late [[1980s]] with a U.S.-based [[techno music|techno]]/hip hop group called [[Technotronic]]. In the group was an emcee named [[Ya Kid K]] from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] who later led the group into international fame with hits like &quot;Pump up the Jam&quot; and &quot;Shake tTat Body&quot;. In [[1990]], she also joined the group Hi-Tek 3 who were heard on the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' movie [[soundtrack]]. 

However, the first major pop rapper from Belgium was [[Benny B]], who had a very mainstream and commercial sound.  According to the [[European Music Office]]'s report on ''Music in Europe'', this was the first of many pop acts that helped inspire a backlash and the creation of an underground hip hop scene [http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/MIE/Part2_chapter08.html].

In the early [[1990s]] the [[Brussels]]' rap crew [[De Puta Madre]] started rapping in French and Spanish. They became an [[Underground_culture|underground]] success and are still highly respected in the Belgian hip hop scene.

In the late 1990s, [[Rwanda]]n hip hop pioneer J.C. Matata moved to Belgium and created a hip hop/[[reggae]]/[[zouk]] group called [[ZAMZAM]]. 

Also in the late [[1990s]] in the [[Wallonia|Walloon south]] of the country, French speaking/rapping [[Starflam]] was the biggest name in hip hop. In the [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[north]] Dutch speaking/rapping groups like [['t Hof van Commerce]], St Andries MC's, and ABN were popular, rapping in their regional [[dialect]]s. One of the most promising bands in 2006 seems to be Last Prophecy.

==List of Belgian hip hop musicians==

*Caveman Speak
*CNN199 (Souterrain)
*Dave Krewcial
*DJ Grazzhoppa
*Laco$te

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like [[France]], the [[Netherlands]] has an African [[hip hop music|hip hop]] scene. [[Rap music|Rap]] groups from [[Cape Verde]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]]-speaking island off the coast of West Africa have been living there. These rappers were [[E-Life]], [[The Real Vibe]], and [[the Postmen]]. The Postmen rap in English, adding a hip hop and [[reggae]] flavor. Two of the members are from Cape Verde and one of them is from [[Suriname]], a Dutch-speaking country in South America. The Netherlands is also home to the ''[[Rumba-Kali]]'', an African hip hop magazine.

Another important Dutch hip hop crew is the [[Osdorp Posse]].  The [[Urban Dance Squad]], though not strictly a hip hop crew, were the first European band to rap [http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/MIE/Part2_chapter08.html].

In 1986, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] rap duo [[MC Miker G &amp; Deejay Sven]] had a top 10 hit across Europe with &quot;Holiday Rap&quot;, which sampled [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna's]] &quot;Holiday&quot;.

One particularly proficient Dutch-language rapper is [[Extince]].  Other notable acts include [[Ali B.]] (who has been featured on other artists' tracks, most significantly with [[Marco Borsato]] on the song &quot;Wat zou je doen?&quot; for the charity [[War Child (charity)|War Child]]) who achieved solo success with &quot;Leipe mocro flavour&quot;. Together with his nephew Yes-R he made an international remix of &quot;Ghetto&quot; together with Akon.; the duo [[Lange Frans &amp; Baas B]] with their patriotic but introspective &quot;[[Het land van (song)|Het Land Van]]&quot;; and [[Yes-R]] but these people have got the biggest hits, but not the best rap skills (wordplay, 'flow' which means a rhyme schedule that sounds good together with the beat, originallity). Most notable for rap skills in Holland these days is the rap group &quot;Opgezwolle&quot; (rapper Sticky Steez, rapper Frico Rico and DJ Delic) and most of all Brainpower. Rapper Jawat, won the &quot;Grote prijs van Nederland&quot; 2006, and has a very original and unique style. Holland has got a fast growing 'underground scene' and rapping in Dutch is very popular.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Anais.jpg|frame|400px|Anaïs Nin]]
'''Anaïs Nin''' (pronounced &quot;ana-EESE neen&quot; [ana'i:s nin]) ([[February 21]] [[1903]] - [[January 14]] [[1977]]) was a [[France|French]]-born [[author]] of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] and [[Denmark|Danish]] descent who became famous for her published [[diary|diaries]], which span more than sixty years, beginning when she was eleven years old and ending shortly before her death. After the deaths of Anaïs Nin and her first husband, Hugh Guiler, the unexpurgated, or uncensored, versions of her diaries were commissioned by her second husband, Rupert Pole, and published to great interest and acclaim. 

Anaïs Nin was born in [[Neuilly]], [[France]]. After her parents separated, her mother moved Anaïs and her two brothers, Thorvald Nin and [[Joaquin Nin-Culmell]] to [[New York City]]. While still a teenager, Nin abandoned formal schooling and began working as a [[model (person)|model]]. In [[1923]], she married Hugh Parker Guiler. The couple moved to [[Paris|Paris, France]] the following year, where Guiler pursued his [[banking]] career and Nin began to pursue her interest in writing, where her first published work was a critical evaluation of [[D. H. Lawrence]] called &quot;D. H. Lawrence: An Unprofessional Study.&quot; She also explored the field of [[psychotherapy]], studying under the likes of [[Otto Rank]], a disciple of [[Sigmund Freud]].

Anaïs Nin is hailed by many critics as one of the finest examples of writers of female [[erotica]]. She was the first woman to really explore the realm. Before her, erotica written by women was virtually unheard of, except for a few writers such as [[Kate Chopin]].  Nin, faced with a desperate need for money, wrote the stories in ''[[Delta of Venus]]'' for a dollar a page in the [[1940s]]. She considered the characters in her erotica to be extreme caricature and never intended for the erotica to be published. Her writing was scandalously explicit for the time. In her unexpurgated diaries, she wrote about her incestuous relationship with her father. 

Nin was a friend, and in some cases lover, of many leading literary figures, including [[Henry Miller]], [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[James Agee]], and [[Lawrence Durrell]].

Her passionate love affair and friendship with Miller (and his wife, June, with whom she did not have an affair as described in the [[Philip Kaufman|Kaufman]] film, ''[[Henry &amp; June]]'') strongly influenced both the woman and the author.
 
In [[1973]] she received an honorary [[doctorate]] from Philadelphia College of Art. She was elected to the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] in [[1974]]. Anaïs Nin died of [[cancer]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] on [[January 14]] [[1977]], her body was [[cremation|cremated]], and her ashes were scattered over [[Santa Monica Bay]].

In [[1990]] [[Philip Kaufman]] made the [[Henry &amp; June|film]] based on her novel ''[[Henry and June|Henry &amp; June]]'' from ''The Journal of Love — The Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin, 1931-1932''.  It starred [[Maria de Medeiros]] as Nin, [[Fred Ward]] as Henry Miller, and [[Uma Thurman]] as June.

To date, the combined sales of books by Anaïs Nin, including the erotica, fiction, literary criticism, and diaries, exceed 3 million.
