== Hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids ==
Depending on how [[polar molecule|polar]] the side chain, aminoacids can be [[hydrophilic]] or [[hydrophobic]] to various degree. This influences their interaction with other structures, both within the protein itself and within other proteins. The distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic aminoacids determines the [[tertiary structure]] of the protein, and their physical location on the outside structure of the proteins influences their [[quaternary structure]]. For example, soluble proteins have surfaces rich with polar aminoacids like [[serine]] and [[threonine]], while [[integral membrane protein]]s tend to have outer ring of hydrophobic aminoacids that anchors them to the [[lipid bilayer]], and proteins anchored to the membrane have a hydrophobic end that locks into the membrane. Similarly, proteins that have to bind to positive-charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged aminoacids like glutamate and aspartate, while proteins binding to negative-charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine.

Hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions of the proteins do not have to rely only on aminoacids themselves. By various [[posttranslational modification]]s other chains can be attached to the proteins, forming hydrophobic [[lipoprotein]]s or hydrophylic [[glycoprotein]]s.

== Nonstandard amino acids ==
Aside from the twenty standard amino acids and the two special amino acids, [[selenocysteine]] and [[pyrrolysine]], already mentioned above, there is a vast number of &quot;nonstandard amino acids&quot; which are not used in the body's regular manufacturing of proteins. Examples of nonstandard amino acids include the [[sulfur]]-containing [[taurine]] and the neurotransmitters [[GABA]] and [[dopamine]]. Other examples are [[lanthionine]], [[2-aminoisobutyric acid]], [[dehydroalanine]], [[dehydro-amino-butyric acid]], 

Nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids. For example, taurine can be formed by the [[decarboxylation]] of cysteine, while dopamine is synthesized from tyrosine and [[hydroxyproline]] is made by a [[posttranslational modification]] from [[proline]].

==Uses of substances derived from amino acids==
* [[Aspartame]] (aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester) is an artificial sweetener.
* [[5-HTP]] (5-hydroxytryptophan) has been used to treat neurological problems associated with [[PKU]] (phenylketonuria), as well as depression (as an alternative to L-Tryptophan).
* [[L-DOPA]] (L-dihydroxyphenylalanine) is a drug used to treat [[Parkinsonism]].
* [[Monosodium glutamate]] is a [[food additive]] to enhance flavor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Alan Turing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Alan Turing is often considered the father of modern [[computer science]].]]
'''Alan Mathison Turing''' ([[June 23]], [[1912]] &amp;ndash; [[June 7]], [[1954]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]], [[logician]], and [[cryptographer]]. Turing is often considered to be a father of modern [[computer science]].

With the [[Turing Test]], Turing made a significant and characteristically provocative contribution to the debate regarding [[artificial intelligence]]: whether it will ever be possible to say that a machine is [[consciousness|conscious]] and can [[thought|think]]. He provided an influential formalisation of the concept of [[algorithm]] and computation with the [[Turing machine]], formulating the now widely accepted &quot;Turing&quot; version of the [[Church–Turing thesis]], namely that any practical computing model has either the equivalent or a subset of the capabilities of a Turing machine.
During [[World War II]], Turing worked at [[Bletchley Park]], Britain's [[cryptanalysis|codebreaking]] centre and was for a time head of [[Hut 8]], the section responsible for German Naval cryptanalysis.  He devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including the method of the [[bombe]], an electromechanical machine which could find settings for the [[Enigma machine]].

After the war, he worked at the [[National Physical Laboratory]], creating one of the first designs for a stored-program computer, although it was never actually built. In 1947 he moved to the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] to work, largely on software, on the [[Manchester Mark I]] then emerging as one of the world's earliest true computers.

In [[1952]], Turing was convicted of acts of gross indecency after admitting to a sexual relationship with a man in Manchester. He was placed on probation and required to undergo [[hormone therapy]]. When Alan Turing died in [[1954]], an inquest found that he had committed suicide by eating an apple laced with [[cyanide]].

== Childhood and youth ==
Turing was conceived in 1911 in Chatrapur, [[India]]. His father, Julius Mathison Turing, was a member of the Indian civil service. Julius and wife Ethel (''née'' Stoney) wanted Alan to be brought up in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], so they returned to [[Paddington]], [[London]]. His father's civil service commission was still active, and during Turing's childhood years his parents travelled between [[Guildford]], [[England]] and [[India]], leaving their two sons to stay with friends in England, rather than risk their health in the British colony. Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius he was to display more prominently later. He is said to have taught himself to read in three weeks, and to have shown an early affinity for numbers and puzzles.

His parents enrolled him at St. Michael's, a day school, at six years of age. The headmistress recognized his genius early on, as did many of his subsequent educators. In 1926, at the age of 14, he went on to [[Sherborne School]] in [[Dorset]]. His first day of term coincided with a [[general strike]] in England, and so determined was he to attend his first day that he rode his bike unaccompanied over sixty miles from [[Southampton]] to school, stopping overnight at an [[inn]] &amp;mdash; a feat reported in the local press.

Turing's natural inclination toward mathematics and science did not earn him respect with the teachers at Sherborne, a famous and expensive [[public school (England)|public school]] (a British private school with charitable status), whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the [[classics]]. His headmaster wrote to his parents: &quot;I hope he will not fall between two schools. If he is to stay at Public School, he must aim at becoming ''educated''. If he is to be solely a ''Scientific Specialist'', he is wasting his time at a Public School&quot;.{{rf|1|Hodges.26}}

But despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having even studied elementary [[calculus]]. In 1928, aged sixteen, Turing encountered [[Albert Einstein]]'s work; not only did he grasp it, but he extrapolated Einstein's questioning of [[Newton's laws of motion]] from a text in which this was never made explicit.

[[Image:KingsCollegeChapel.jpg|thumb|320px|The computer room at King's is now named after Turing, who became a student there in 1931 and a Fellow in 1935.]]

Turing's hopes and ambitions at school were raised by his strong feelings for his friend Christopher Morcom, with whom he fell in love, though the feeling was not reciprocated. Morcom died only a few weeks into their last term at Sherborne, from complications of [[bovine]] [[tuberculosis]], contracted after drinking infected cow's milk as a boy. Turing was heart-broken.

== University and his work on computability ==
Due to his unwillingness to work as hard on his classical studies as on science and mathematics, Turing failed to win a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and went on to the college of his second choice, [[King's College, Cambridge]]. He was an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934, graduating with a distinguished degree, and in 1935 was elected a Fellow at King's on the strength of a dissertation on the Gaussian [[error function]].

[[Image:Turingbus.jpg|thumb|320px|Alan Turing, on the steps of the bus, with members of the Walton Athletic Club, 1946.]]
In his momentous paper &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&quot; (submitted on [[May 28]], [[1936]]), Turing reformulated [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[1931]] results on the limits of proof and computation, substituting Gödel's universal arithmetics-based formal language by what are now called [[Turing machine]]s, formal and simple devices. He proved that such a machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical problem if it were representable as an [[algorithm]], even if no actual Turing machine would be likely to have practical applications, being much slower than alternatives.

Turing machines are to this day the central object of study in [[computation|theory of computation]]. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is uncomputable: it is not possible to algorithmically decide whether a given Turing machine will ever halt. While his proof was published subsequent to [[Alonzo Church]]'s equivalent proof in respect to his [[lambda calculus]], Turing's work is considerably more accessible and intuitive. It was also novel in its notion of a &quot;Universal (Turing) Machine,&quot; the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine. The paper also introduces the notion of [[definable number]]s.

Most of 1937 and 1938 he spent at [[Princeton University]], studying under Alonzo Church. In 1938 he obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from Princeton; his dissertation introduced the notion of [[hypercomputation]] where Turing machines are augmented with so-called [[oracle machine|oracles]], allowing a study of problems that cannot be solved algorithmically.

Back in Cambridge in 1939, he attended lectures by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] about the [[foundations of mathematics]]. The two argued and disagreed vehemently, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein arguing that mathematics is overvalued and does not discover any absolute truths (Wittgenstein 1932/1976).

== Cryptanalysis ==
[[Image:Bombe-rebuild.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Replica of a bombe machine]]
During [[World War II]], Turing was a major participant in the efforts at [[Bletchley Park]] to break German ciphers. Turing's codebreaking work was kept secret until the [[1970s]]; not even his close friends knew about it. He contributed several mathematical insights into breaking both the [[Enigma machine]] and the [[Lorenz SZ 40/42]] (a teletype cipher attachment codenamed &quot;Tunny&quot; by the British), and was, for a time, head of Hut 8, the section responsible for reading German Naval signals.

[[Image:Turing_flat.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Two cottages in the stable yard at Bletchley Park. Turing worked here from 1939&amp;ndash;1940 until he moved to Hut 8.]]
Since September 1938, Turing had been recruited to work part-time for the [[Government Code and Cypher School]]. Turing reported to [[Bletchley Park]] when war was declared in September 1939. To break Enigma, Turing devised an electromechanical machine which searched for the correct settings of the Enigma rotors.

The machine was called the [[bombe]], named after the Polish-designed ''[[Bomba (cryptography)|bomba]]''. Using a bombe, it was possible to ignore the effect of the Enigma plugboard and consider the settings of its rotors alone, and eliminate most of them from consideration. For each possible setting, a chain of logical deductions was implemented electrically, and it was possible to detect when a contradiction had occurred and rule out that setting. Turing's bombe was first installed on [[18 March]] [[1940]], and, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]], was the primary tool used to read Enigma traffic. Over 200 bombes were in operation by the end of the war.

In December 1940, Turing solved the naval Enigma indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services. Turing also invented a [[Bayesian]] statistical technique termed &quot;[[Banburismus]]&quot; to assist in breaking Naval Enigma. Banburismus could rule out certain orders of the Enigma rotors, reducing time needed to test settings on the bombes. Against the Lorenz cipher, Turing devised a technique termed ''Turingismus'' or ''Turingery'', although other methods were also used.

In the spring of 1941, Turing proposed marriage to fellow Hut 8 co-worker [[Joan Clarke]], although the engagement was broken off by mutual agreement in the summer.

In late November 1942, Turing visited the US to work on [[secure speech]] devices and Naval Enigma, returning in March 1943. During his absence, [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] had assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been ''de facto'' head for some time, Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section. Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.

In the latter part of the war, teaching himself electronics at the same time, Turing undertook (assisted by engineer [[Donald Bayley]]) the design of a portable machine codenamed ''[[Delilah (secure speech)|Delilah]]'' to allow [[secure voice]] communications. Intended for different applications, Delilah lacked capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions, and  was completed too late to be used in the war. Though Turing demonstrated it to officials by encrypting/decrypting a recording of a [[Winston Churchill]] speech, Delilah was not adopted for use.

In 1945, Turing was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for his sterling wartime services.

== Early computers and the Turing Test ==
[[Image:Turingrunning.jpeg|frame|left|Turing achieved world-class [[Marathon (sport)|Marathon]] standards. His best time of 2 hours, 46 minutes, 3 seconds, was only 11 minutes slower than the winner in the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Olympic Games]].]]

From 1945 to 1947 he was at the [[National Physical Laboratory]], where he worked on the design of [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine).  He presented a paper on February 19, 1946, which was the first complete design of a [[Von Neumann architecture|stored-program computer]].  Although he succeeded in designing the ACE, there were delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned.  In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a 'sabbatical' year.  While he was at Cambridge, work on building the ACE stopped before it was ever begun.  In 1949 he became deputy director of the computing laboratory at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]], and worked on software for one of the earliest true computers &amp;mdash; the [[Manchester Mark I]]. During this time he continued to do more abstract work, and in &quot;[[Computing machinery and intelligence]]&quot; (Mind, October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of [[artificial intelligence]], and proposed an experiment now known as the [[Turing test]], an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called &quot;sentient&quot;.

In 1948, Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, [[D.G. Champernowne]], began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist.  In 1952, lacking a computer powerful enough to execute the program, Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer, taking about half an hour per move. [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1356927  The game] was recorded; the program lost to a colleague of Turing, [[Alick Glennie]], however, it is said that the program won a game against Champernowne's wife.

== Pattern formation and mathematical biology ==
Turing worked from 1952 until his death in 1954 on [[mathematical biology]], specifically [[morphogenesis]]. He published one paper on the subject called &quot;The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis&quot; in 1952. His central interest in the field was understanding [[Leonardo of Pisa|Fibonacci]] phyllotaxis, the existence of [[Fibonacci number]]s in plant structures. He used reaction-diffusion equations which are now central to the field of [[pattern formation]]. Later papers went unpublished until 1992 when ''Collected Works of A.M. Turing'' was published.

== Prosecution for homosexuality and Turing's death ==

Turing was a homosexual man during a period when homosexuality was illegal. In 1952, his lover, Arnold Murray, helped an accomplice to break into Turing's house, and Turing went to the police to report the crime. As a result of the police investigation, Turing acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray, and they were charged with gross indecency under [[Criminal_Law_Amendment_Act_of_1885#Section_11|Section 11]] of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885.  Turing was unrepentant and was convicted. Although he could have been sent to prison, he was placed on probation, conditional on him undergoing [[hormone|hormonal]] [[chemical castration|treatment]] designed to reduce [[libido]]. He accepted the [[estrogen|oestrogen]] hormone injections, which lasted for a year, with side effects including the [[gynecomastia|development of breasts]]. His conviction led to a removal of his security clearance and prevented him from continuing consultancy for [[GCHQ]] on cryptographic matters.

In 1954, he died of [[cyanide]] [[poisoning]], apparently from a cyanide-laced apple he left half-eaten.  The apple itself was never tested for contamination with cyanide, and cyanide poisoning as a cause of death was established by a post-mortem. Most believe that his death was intentional, and the death was ruled a [[suicide]].  It is rumoured that this method of self-poisoning was in tribute to Turing's beloved film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.  His mother, however, strenuously argued that the ingestion was accidental due to his careless storage of laboratory chemicals. Friends of his have said that Turing may have killed himself in this ambiguous way quite deliberately, to give his mother some plausible deniability.  The possibility of assassination has also been suggested, owing to Turing's involvement in the secret service and the perception of Turing as a security risk due to his homosexuality.

In the book, ''Zeroes and Ones'', author [[Sadie Plant]] speculates that the [[rainbow]] [[Apple Computer#Logo|Apple logo]] with a bite taken out of it was an homage to Turing.  This seems to be an [[urban legend]] as the Apple logo was designed in 1976, two years before Gilbert Baker's [[rainbow flag|rainbow pride flag]].

== Recognition ==
Since 1966, the [[Turing Award]] has been given by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] to a person for technical contributions to the computing community. It is widely considered to be the equivalent of the [[Nobel Prize]] in the computing world.

In 1994 a stretch of the [[Manchester]] city ring road was named Alan Turing Way.

On [[23 June]] [[1998]], on what would have been Turing's 86th birthday, [[Andrew Hodges]], his biographer, unveiled an official [[English Heritage]] [[Blue Plaque]] on his childhood home in Warrington Crescent, [[London]], now the Colonnade hotel [http://www.turing.org.uk/bio/oration.html], [http://www.blueplaque.com/detail.php?plaque_id=348].

on [[June 23]] [[2001]].  It is in [[Sackville Park]], between the [[University of Manchester]] building on Whitworth Street and the [[Canal Street, Manchester|Canal Street]] [[gay village]]. To mark the 50th anniversary of his death, a memorial plaque was unveiled at his former residence, Hollymeade, in Wilmslow on [[June 7]] [[2004]].
[[Image:Turing_Plaque.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Plaque marking Turing's home]]

The [[Alan Turing Institute]] was initiated by [[UMIST]] and [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in Summer 2004.

A celebration of Turing's life and achievements was held at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] on [[5 June]] [[2004]]; it was arranged by the [[British Logic Colloquium]] and the [[British Society for the History of Mathematics]].

On [[October 28]] [[2004]] a bronze statue of Alan Turing sculpted by [[John W. Mills]] was unveiled at the [[University of Surrey]] [http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/press/oct2004/281004a/]. The statue marks the 50th anniversary of Turing's death. It portrays Turing carrying his books across the campus.

[[Holtsoft]] produces a [[Turing programming language|programming language]] named for Turing.  The language is designed for beginner programmers and has no direct access to the hardware.

The [[Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico]] named a computer laboratory for graduate studies the [[Turing Lab]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article explains the meaning of area as a [[physical quantity]]. The article [[area (geometry)]] is more mathematical. See also [[area (disambiguation)]].''

'''Area''' is a physical [[quantity]] expressing the size of a part of a [[surface]]. '''Surface area''' is the summation of the areas of the exposed sides of an [[object (philosophy)|object]]. 

== Units ==

Units for measuring surface area include:
:[[square metre]] = [[SI derived unit]]
:[[are]] = 100 square metres
:[[hectare]] = 10,000 square metres
:[[square kilometre]] = 1,000,000 square metres
:square megametre = 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; square metres

[[Imperial unit]]s, as currently defined from the metre:
:[[square foot]] (plural square feet) = 0.09290304 square metres
:[[square yard]] = 9 square feet = 0.83612736 square metres
:square [[perch]] = 30.25 square yards = 25.2928526 square metres
:[[acre]] = 160 square perches or 43,560 square feet = 4046.8564224 square metres
:[[square mile]] = 640 acres = 2.5899881103 square kilometres

Old European area units, still in used in some private matters (e.g. land sale advertisements)
:square [[fathom]]or fahomia in some sources = 3.5967 square metres
:[[cadastral]] moon(acre) = 1600� square fathoms = 5755 square metres

The article [[Orders of magnitude]] links to lists of [[orders of magnitude (area)|objects of comparable surface area]].

==Useful formulas==
*Area of a [[rectangle]] (and, in particular, a [[square (geometry)|square]]): [[length]] &amp;times; [[width]]
*Area of a [[triangle]]: [[½]] &amp;times; [[base]] &amp;times; [[height]]
*Area of a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]]: [[pi|&amp;pi;]] &amp;times; [[radius|r]]²
*Area of an [[ellipse]]: [[pi|&amp;pi;]] &amp;times; [[semi-major axis|a]] &amp;times; [[semi-minor axis|b]]
*Area of a [[sphere]]: 4 &amp;times; [[pi|&amp;pi;]] &amp;times; [[radius|r]]² = &amp;pi; &amp;times; [[diameter|d]]² (which is the first [[derivative]] of the [[formula]] for [[volume]] of a [[sphere]])
*Area of a [[trapezoid]]: If a and b are the two parallel sides and h is the distance (height) between the parallels, the area formula is as below:
:&lt;math&gt;A=\frac{1}{2}(a+b)h&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;A=\frac{h(a+b)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Total surface area of a [[right circular cylinder]]: 2 &amp;times; [[pi| &amp;pi;]] &amp;times; [[radius|r]] &amp;times; ([[height|h]] + [[radius|r]])
*Lateral surface area of a [[right circular cylinder]]: 2 &amp;times; [[pi| &amp;pi;]] &amp;times; [[radius|r]] &amp;times; [[height|h]]
*Total surface area of a [[right circular cone]]: [[pi| &amp;pi;]] &amp;times; [[radius|r]] &amp;times; ([[slant height|l]] + [[radius|r]])
*Lateral surface area of a [[right circular cone]]: [[pi| &amp;pi;]] &amp;times; [[radius|r]] &amp;times; [[slant height|l]]

&lt;!--The total surface area and lateral surface area of a right circular cylinder and cone formulae were taken from R.S. Aggarwal's Mathematics for Class 8--&gt;
&lt;!--
a table of areas&lt;-&gt;diameters isn't exactly very relevant here. and statements of currents are meaningless without information on the cable type ambient temperature and installation conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''astronomical unit''' ('''AU''' or '''au''' or '''a.u.''' or sometimes '''ua''') is a unit of [[distance]], approximately equal to the [[mean]] distance between [[Earth]] and [[Sun]]. The currently accepted value of the AU is 149 597 870 691 ± 30 metres (about 150 million kilometres or 93 million miles).

The symbol &quot;ua&quot; is recommended by the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] [http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter4/table7.html], but in the United States and other anglophone countries the reverse usage is more common. The [[International Astronomical Union]] recommends &quot;au&quot; [http://www.iau.org/IAU/Activities/nomenclature/units.html] and [[international standard]] [[ISO 31-1]] uses &quot;AU&quot;.

== The distance ==

Earth's [[orbit]] is not a [[circle]] but an [[ellipse]]; originally, the AU was defined as the [[length]] of the [[semimajor axis]] of said orbit. For greater precision, the International Astronomical Union in [[1976]] defined the AU as the distance from the Sun at which a [[test particle|particle]] of negligible [[mass]], in an unperturbed circular orbit, would have an [[orbital period]] of 365.256 898 3 days (a [[Gaussian year]]). More accurately, it is the distance such that the heliocentric [[gravitational constant]] (the product GM&lt;sub&gt;&amp;#9737;&lt;/sub&gt;) is equal to (0.017 202 098 95)² AU³/d².

==History==

[[Aristarchus of Samos]] estimated the distance to the Sun to be about 20 times the distance to the moon, whereas the true ratio is about 390. His estimate was based on the angle between the half moon and the sun, which he estimated as 87&amp;deg;.

According to [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in the ''[[Praeparatio Evangelica]]'', [[Eratosthenes]] found the distance to the sun to be &quot;σταδιων μυριαδας τετρακοσιας και οκτωκισμυριας&quot; (literally &quot;of stadia myriads 400 and 80000&quot;). This has been translated either as 4,080,000 [[stadia]] (1903 translation by [[E. H. Gifford]]), or as 804,000,000 stadia (edition of [[Edouard des Places]], dated 1974-1991). Using the Greek stadium of 185 metres, the former translation comes to a far-too-low 755,000 km, whereas the second translation comes to a very accurate 149 million km.

At the time the AU was introduced, its actual value was very poorly known, but planetary distances in terms of AU could be determined from heliocentric geometry and [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]. The value of the AU was first estimated by [[Jean Richer]] and [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] in [[1672]]. By measuring the [[parallax]] of [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] from two locations on the Earth, they arrived at a figure of about 140 million kilometers.

A somewhat more accurate estimate can be obtained by observing the [[transit of Venus]].
This method was devised by [[Edmond Halley]], and applied to the transits of Venus observed in [[1761]] and [[1769]], and then again in [[1874]] and [[1882]].

Another method involved determining the constant of [[aberration of light|aberration]], and [[Simon Newcomb]] gave great weight to this method when deriving his widely accepted value of 8.80&quot; for the [[solar parallax]] (close to the modern value of 8.794 148&quot;).

The discovery of the [[near-Earth asteroid]] [[433 Eros]] and its passage near the Earth in [[1900]]&amp;ndash;[[1901]] allowed a considerable improvement in parallax measurement. More recently very precise measurements have been carried out by [[radar]] and by [[telemetry]] from [[space probe]]s.

While the value of the astronomical unit is now known to great precision, the value of the mass of the Sun is not, because of uncertainty in the value of the [[gravitational constant]]. Because the gravitational constant is known to only five or six significant digits while the positions of the planets are known to 11 or 12 digits, calculations in celestial mechanics are typically performed in solar masses and astronomical units rather than in kilograms and kilometres. This approach makes all results dependent on the gravitational constant. A conversion to [[SI]] units would separate the results from the gravitational constant, at the cost of introducing additional uncertainty by assigning a specific value to that unknown constant.

It is known that the mass of the Sun is very slowly decreasing, and therefore the orbital period of a body at a given distance is increasing. This implies that the AU is getting smaller (by about one centimetre per year) over time.

== Examples ==

The distances are approximate mean distances. It has to be taken into consideration that the distances between [[astronomical object|celestial bodies]] change in [[time]] due to their [[orbit]]s and other factors.

* The [[Earth]] is 1.00 ± 0.02 AU from the [[Sun]].
* The [[Moon]] is 0.0026 ± 0.0001 AU from the Earth.
* [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] is 1.52 ± 0.14 AU from the Sun.
* [[Jupiter]] is 5.20 ± 0.05 AU from the Sun.
* [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]] is 39.5 ± 9.8 AU from the Sun.
* [[90377 Sedna]]'s orbit ranges between 76 and 942 AU from the Sun; Sedna is currently ([[as of 2006]]) about 90 AU from the Sun.
* As of November 2005, [[Voyager 1]] (the farthest [[human]]-made object) is 97 AU from the Sun.
* The mean diameter of the [[Solar system]], including the [[Oort cloud]], is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; AU.

{{wikiquote}}
'''Artist''' is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an [[art]]. It is also used in a qualitative sense of a person [[creativity|creative]] in, [[innovation|innovative]] in, or adept at, an artistic practice.

Most often, the term describes those who create within a context of 'high culture', activities such as [[drawing and painting]], [[sculpture]], [[acting]], [[dancing]], [[writing]], [[filmmaking]] and [[music]] &amp;mdash; people who use imagination, and talent or skill, to create works that can be judged to have an [[aesthetic]] value. [[Art history|Art historians]] and [[Art critic| critics]] will define as artists those who produce [[art]] within a recognised or recognisable discipline.

The term is also used to denote highly skilled people in non-&quot;arts&quot; activities, as well &amp;mdash; crafts, medicine, alchemy, mechanics, mathematics, defense (martial arts) and architecture, for example. The designation is applied to illegal activities, like a &quot;scam artist&quot;. The term 'artist' could also refer to a con artist.

There is no consensus about what constitutes &quot;art&quot; or who is, or is not, an &quot;artist&quot;. Often, discussions on the subject focus on the differences between &quot;artist&quot; and &quot;[[Technician|technician]]&quot; or &quot;[[Entertainer|entertainer]],&quot; or &quot;[[Artisan|artisan]],&quot; &quot;[[fine arts|fine art]]&quot; and &quot;[[Applied art|applied art]],&quot; or what constitutes art and what does not.  In addition, the [[French language|French]] word '''artiste''' (which in French, simply means &quot;artist&quot;) has been imported into the [[English language]]; in English-usage it has connotations (some of them derogatory) which differ somewhat from the English term [[artist]].

The Oxford English dictionary, cites broad meanings of the term &quot;artist,&quot;

:* A learned person or Master of Arts.
:* One who pursues a practical science, traditionally medicine, astrology, alchemy, chemistry.
:* A follower of a pursuit in which skill comes by study or practice - the opposite of a theorist.
:* A follower of a manual art, such as a mechanic.
:* One who makes their [[craft]] a fine art.
:* One who cultivates one of the fine arts - traditionally the arts presided over by the [[muses]].

In Greek the word &quot;techn&amp;#283;&quot; is often mistranslated into &quot;art.&quot; In actuality, &quot;techn&amp;#283;&quot; implies mastery of a craft (any craft.)  The Latin-derived form of the word is &quot;tecnicus&quot;, from which the English words [[technique]], [[technology]], [[technical]] are derived. Our word art is derived from the Latin &quot;ars&quot;, which, though literally defined means &quot;skill method&quot; or &quot;technique&quot;, holds a connotation of [[beauty]]. 

Many contemporary definitions of &quot;artist&quot; and &quot;art&quot; are highly contingent on [[culture]], resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting [[beauty]] and the beautiful cannot be easily standardized without corruption into [[kitsch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Aktation, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|Actaeon and his dogs]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Actaeon''' (or '''Aktaion'''), son of [[Aristaeus]] and [[Autonoe]] in [[Boeotia]], was a hunter who suffered the wrath of [[Artemis]].

Artemis was bathing in the woods near Boeotian [[Orchomenus (town)|Orchomenos]] when the hunter Actaeon stumbled across her, thus seeing her naked.  He stopped and stared, amazed at her ravishing beauty.  When she saw him, Artemis punished him by declaring that he must never speak again — if he tried to speak, he would be changed into a [[Deer (mythology)|stag]] — for his unlucky profanation of her virgin's mysteries. Upon hearing his hunting group calling to him, he cried out to them and immediately was changed into a stag. His own hounds turned upon him instantly and killed him.  He was torn apart.   The hounds were so upset with their master's death, that [[Chiron]] made a statue so lifelike that the hounds thought it was Actaeon.

There are various other versions: [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] states that his offence was that he was a rival of [[Zeus]] for [[Semele]] (who was also his aunt), while in [[Euripedes]] ''Bacchae'' he boasts that he is better hunter than Artemis. 

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
:ὁρᾷς τὸν Ἀκτέωνος ἄθλιον μόρον,
:ὃν ὠμόσιτοι σκύλακες ἃς ἐθρέψατο
:διεσπάσαντο, κρείσσον' ἐν κυναγίαις
:Ἀρτέμιδος εἶναι κομπάσαντ', ἐν ὀργάσιν.
&lt;td&gt;
:Look at Actaeon's wretched fate
:who by the man-eating hounds he had raised,
:was torn apart, better at hunting
:than Artemis he had boasted to be, in the meadows.
&lt;/table&gt;

[[Diodorus Siculus]] has it that Actaeon wanted to marry Artemis.  Other authors say the hounds were Artemis' own. 

== Actaeon in art ==
{{Commonscat|Actaeon}}

Actaeon torn by his hounds is a common theme in [[5th century BC]] Greek art: in some [[red-figure pottery|vase painting]]s  he is shown wearing a deerskin, in others antlers sprout from his head. Pictures of Artemis surprised by Actaeon while bathing are found among [[Pompeii|Pompeian]] wall paintings.

&lt;!--[[Image:Tizian 001.jpg|thumb|Titian: ''Diana suprised by Actaeon while bathing'']]--&gt;
The theme was one of many revived in the [[Renaissance]].  See for example:

The term '''''Anglican''''' (from [[Anglia]], the [[Latin (language)|Latin]] name for England) describes the people and churches that follow the religious traditions developed by the [[state religion|established]] [[Church of England]]. The [[Anglican Communion]] codifies the Anglican relationship to the Church of England as a theologically broad and often diverging community of churches, which holds the English church as its mother institution.  Adherents of Anglicanism within the [[Anglican Communion]] (that is in communion with the [[See of Canterbury]]) worldwide number around 70 million but there are numerous denominations which consider themselves Anglican but which are out of the Communion.

The issue of [[Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] affiliation is often confusing. Whilst many Anglicans regard themselves as being within the Protestant tradition, many other Anglicans, especially [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]], do not consider themselves as Protestants.  The Church of England claims explicitly that the Church &quot;upholds the catholic faith.&quot; (The Athanasian Creed states &quot;And the catholic faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; Neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the substance.&quot;  The phrase &quot;catholic church&quot; by definition means the universal Christian Church but also holds the sense of the &quot;church in its fullness&quot; ). 

Ultimately, the Anglican Church considers itself as being both catholic (stressing its continuity with the ancient Church), and Reformed / Protestant (noting that the Church does not accept the universal infallible authority of the Pope). The conduct of eucharistically-centred worship services is in keeping with the catholic liturgical tradition and the Communion emphasises its status of [[full communion]] with the [[Old Catholic Church|Old-Catholic Utrecht Union]] &amp;mdash; a small community of churches which split from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[1870]] over the doctrine of papal infallibility.  On the other hand, the development of Anglicanism as a distinctive theological tradition is also deeply connected with the [[Protestant Reformation]]. 

As with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] churches (but unlike most Protestant churches), Anglicans claim authority within the church through [[apostolic succession]] from the first followers of [[Jesus]].  The Anglican-Roman Catholic International Consultation actually reached agreement on the doctrine of the ministry in their Elucidation of 1979 [http://www.prounione.urbe.it/dia-int/arcic/doc/e_arcic_elucid_min.html], but the [[Roman Catholic Church]] continues to hold that Anglican Orders are not &quot;valid.&quot; In contrast, Anglican Orders are recognized as valid by the [[Old Catholic Church|Old-Catholics]] and [[Lutheran]]s, communions which also consider themselves &quot;the Catholic Church.&quot; Anglicans traditionally date their church back at least to its first Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Augustine of Canterbury|Saint Augustine of Canterbury]], in the 6th century and even centuries earlier to the [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation]]. Many Anglicans point out that Christian missionaries existed in the British lands from the 1st century, with bishops established at Glastonbury by commission from the Apostle Philip. They consider [[Celtic Christianity]] a prefix of their faith, since many Celtic elements remained, even after the Synod of Whitby conformed to Roman customs (well after the establishment of the Canterbury See). They also point out that bishops from the British Isles participated in the early Ecumenical Councils - most significantly [[Pelagius]], the monk who was almost successful in stopping [[Original Sin]] from becoming an official Church doctrine.

== Origins ==
''See also: [[History of the Church of England]]'' 

While Anglicans acknowledge that the [[schisms|schism]] from papal authority under [[Henry VIII of England]] led to the Church of England existing as a separate entity, they also stress its continuity with the pre-Reformation Church of England. The organisational machinery of the Church of England was in place by the time of the Synod of Hertford in 672-673 AD when the English bishops were for the first time able to act as one body under the leadership of the Archbishop of Canterbury.  Since the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] the [[Church of England]] has enjoyed a heritage that is both Catholic and Protestant  with the British monarch as its [[Supreme Governor]].  Contrary to much popular belief, the  British monarch is not the constitutional &quot;Head&quot; of the Church of England and it is incorrect to refer to the monarch as such.  The monarch has no constitutional role in Anglican churches in other parts of the world although the prayer books of several countries maintain prayers for &quot;Our Sovereign Lady Elizabeth,&quot; and the versicle at [[Morning Prayer]] &quot;O Lord save the Queen,&quot; which in the United States prayer book, for example, is altered to &quot;O Lord save the state.&quot;

{{Anglicanism}}
Nonetheless, the [[English Reformation]] was initially driven by the dynastic goals of [[Henry VIII of England]], who, in his quest for a queen to bear him a male heir, found it necessary and profitable to replace the [[Papacy]] with the English crown. Henry's need for a legitimate male heir was real. England's previous experience in the twelfth century of rule by a queen had been a disaster that no-one wished to see repeated. (see [[Empress Matilda]]) It was not Henry's intention to found a new church.  He was well informed enough about history to know that the powers he was claiming were those which had been exercised by European monarchs over the church in their dominions since the time of Constantine and that what had changed since then had been the growth of papal power.  The [[Act of Supremacy]] put Henry at the head of the church in [[1534]], while acts such as the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] put huge amounts of church land and property into the hands of [[the Crown]] and ultimately into those of the English nobility.  These created vested interests which made a powerful material incentive to support a separate Christian church in England  under the rule of the Monarch.  The theological justification for Anglican distinctiveness was begun by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Cranmer]] and continued by other thinkers such as [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]] and [[Lancelot Andrewes]].  Cranmer had studied in Europe and was influenced by the ideas of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and had also married despite being a priest.  Because Cranmer and other leaders of the Church of England had been ordained by bishops in the [[Apostolic Succession]], and passed on that ordination to their successors, Anglicans consider that they have retained the historic apostolic succession, but differ as to how significant this is.

During the short reign of [[Edward VI of England |Edward VI]], Henry's son, Cranmer was able to move the Church of England significantly towards a more Protestant [[Calvinist]] position.  The first [[Book of Common Prayer]] dates from this period. This reform was reversed abruptly in the subsequent reign of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]].  Only under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] was the English church established as a reformed Catholic church that was accepting of Calvinistic and Evangelical theology.

In the 16th century religious life was an important part of the cement which held society together.  Differences in religion were likely to lead to civil unrest at the very least, with treason and foreign invasion possibly thrown in as well.  Elizabeth's solution to the problem of minimising bloodshed over religion in her dominions was a [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|religious settlement]] which prescribed a fixed, sparer form of worship, in the vernacular, in which everyone was expected to take part, i.e. ''common prayer'', but a belief system formulated in a way that would allow people with different understandings of what the Bible taught to give assent. The Protestant principle that all things must be proved by scripture was endorsed in article VI of the [[Thirty-nine Articles]], so that no one could be required to believe anything unless it could be clearly proved from the Scriptures. This did recognise that there were areas where the Bible did not give clear cut teaching, where differences of opinion among Christians were legitimate. The bulk of the population was willing to go along with Elizabeth's religious settlement, but extremists at both ends of the theological spectrum would have nothing to do with it, and cracks in the façade of religious unity in England were appearing.   

For the next century there were significant swings back and forth between the [[Puritan]]s and those with a less Reformed understanding of Anglicanism. It must be understood that the concept of religious freedom was in those days neither understood nor accepted by many people, and that the groups involved in the struggle were aiming for control, not freedom. By continental standards the level of violence over religion was not high, but among the casualties were a king ([[Charles I of England|Charles I]]) and an Archbishop of Canterbury ([[William Laud]]). The final outcome in [[1660]] after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was not too far removed from the Elizabethan ideal. One difference was that the ideal of encompassing all the people of England in one religious organisation, taken for granted by the [[Tudors]], had to be abandoned. The religious landscape of England assumed its present form, with an Anglican established church occupying the middle ground, and the two extremes, Roman Catholic and those Puritans who dissented from the establishment, too strong to be suppressed altogether, having to continue their existence outside the national church, rather than controlling it. The English Reformation may be said to have ended at this point.  

The Elizabethan settlement failed in that it was never able to gain the assent of the entire English people. Yet as the Anglican form of Christianity is now flourishing in many parts of the world far away from England it may possibly have succeeded beyond the wildest expectations of anybody alive in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

==Leadership==

The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] has a precedence of honour over the other archbishops of the Anglican Communion. He is recognised as [[primus inter pares]], or first amongst equals. The Archbishop of Canterbury, however, does not exercise any direct authority in the provinces outside England. The current Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Rowan Williams]], as former [[Archbishop of Wales]], is the first primate appointed from outside the Church of England since the Reformation. All Anglican priests have Apostolic Succession.

Since the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] ultimate authority in the [[Church of England]] has been vested in the reigning monarch. Since the time of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] the sovereign's title has been 'Supreme Governor' rather than 'Head' of the Church of England. In practice this means that the monarch has the responsibility of seeing that the administrative machinery of the church is running smoothly, and in particular that new bishops are appointed when needed. Today this responsibility is discharged by the Prime Minister. Anglican churches outside England do not have this relationship with the British monarch, however it remains the case that the Archbishop of Canterbury, leader of the worldwide Anglican Communion, is appointed by [[the Crown]] of the United Kingdom (in theory; in practice by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]).

==Churches==
Anglicanism is most commonly identified with the established [[Church of England]], but Anglican churches exist in most parts of the world. In some countries (e.g., the [[United States]], [[Scotland]]) the Anglican church is known as Episcopal, from the Latin ''episcopus'', &quot;[[bishop]]&quot;, which comes from a [[Greek language|Greek]] word literally meaning an &quot;overseer.&quot; Some Anglican churches are not in communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury but consider themselves ''Anglican'' because they retain practices of the Church of England and the [[Book of Common Prayer]].

Each [[national church]] or [[province (Anglican)|province]] is headed by a [[Primate (religion)|Primate]] called a [[Primus of Scotland|Primus]] in the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], an [[Archbishop]] in most countries, a [[Presiding Bishop]] in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church USA]] and a Prime Bishop in the Philippine Episcopal Church.  These churches are divided into a number of dioceses, usually corresponding to state or metropolitan divisions.

There are three orders of the ordained ministry: [[deacon]], [[priest]] and [[bishop]]. No requirement is made for [[clerical celibacy]] and women may be ordained as deacons in almost all provinces, as priests in some, and as bishops in a few provinces. Religious orders of monks, brothers, sisters and nuns were suppressed in England during the Reformation but have made a reappearance in Victorian times and thrive today.

Those Anglican churches &quot;in [[full communion|communion]]&quot; with the See of [[Canterbury, Kent|Canterbury]] constitute the [[Anglican Communion]], a formal organisation made up of churches at the national level.  However, there are a large number of denominations (albeit insignificant in terms of number of adherents) which call themselves Anglican that are known as the &quot;[[Anglican continuing churches|continuing church]]&quot; movement and do not acknowledge the Anglican Communion. They are generally conservative-to-traditionalist and, to a varying degree [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] in their doctrinal orientation, but tend to side politically with [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] of the right; some, however, are at the extreme evangelical end of the churchmanship spectrum, such as the [[Church of England in South Africa]] (not in communion in Canterbury but in communion with the [[Diocese of Sydney]]), and the [[Reformed Episcopal Church]]. They consider the Church of England and the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], as well as some other member churches of the Anglican Communion, to have departed from the historic faith by ordaining women, by ordaining openly gay people, by altering the theological emphases of the 1928 [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the Episcopal Church of the United States or the 1662 Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England, and by loosening the Church's traditional regulations concerning sexual and marital matters. There are also those independent jurisdictions, such as The National Anglican Catholic Church of the United States - which uses Anglican, Catholic and Lutheran principles in their doctrine. In the Indian subcontinent Anglican churches have entered into formal union with evangelical protestant denominations while remaining part of the Anglican Communion and indeed bringing their Presbyterian and other historically non-Anglican fellows along with them. As a percentage of the total population these united churches are not significant but numerically they are very substantial other than in Bangladesh.  See [[Church of North India]], [[Church of South India]], [[Church of Pakistan]] and [[Church of Bangladesh]].

==Doctrine==

Anglicans look for authority (in the formula of [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]]) in the experience of Scripture, Reason, and Tradition (the practices and writings of the historical church). While it is often taught that these three are of equal value (using an image of a three-legged stool), the Anglican formularies have always pointed out that:

::&quot;Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation.&quot; (Article VI, The [[Thirty-nine Articles|Anglican Thirty-nine Articles of Religion]]).

Historically, Anglicans have regarded the [[Bible]], the three Creeds ([[Nicene Creed]], [[Apostles' Creed]], and [[Athanasian Creed]]), the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of Religion and the [[Book of Common Prayer]] (1662) as the principal norms of doctrine. Thus, some have said that the Anglican Church retains much of the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, but is tolerant of [[Reformed]] doctrine.  This state of affairs is a consequence of the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]]. The traditional liturgy of Anglicanism, the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, has been considered &quot;too Catholic&quot; by those of Puritan leanings in the 16th century and Evangelicals in later periods, and &quot;too Evangelical&quot; by those of [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] leanings.

This distinction is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican Churches and throughout the Anglican Communion by members themselves. Since the [[Oxford Movement]] of the mid-19th century, many churches of the Communion have embraced and extended liturgical and pastoral practices dissimilar with most Reformed Protestant theology. This extends beyond the ceremony of [[High Church]] services to even more theologically significant territory. Some Anglican clergy practise all seven of the [[sacraments]] in a marked way, in departure from the teaching of early Protestant thinkers like [[John Calvin]] and [[Martin Luther]], even though opinions vary about the best way to understand these &quot;sacramental rites&quot;. For example, some Anglican clergy will hear private confessions from their parishioners, a practice widely discontinued in Protestant denominations. Nevertheless, while Anglo-Catholic practices, particularly liturgical ones, have become much more mainstream within the denomination over the last century, there remain many areas where practices and beliefs remain on the more Protestant or Evangelical side of the debate.

==Churchmanship==

Anglicanism has always been characterised by diversity in theology and the ceremonial (or lack thereof) of the liturgy. Different individuals, groups, parishes, dioceses, and national churches may identify more with Catholic traditions and theology or, alternatively, with the principles of Evangelicalism. 

Some Anglicans follow such devotional practices common among Roman Catholics as solemn benediction of the reserved sacrament, use of the [[rosary]], or of [[anglican prayer beads]], and prayer to the departed saints, which is contrary to the teaching of some of the English Reformers. Some give greater weight to the [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] books of the Bible. (See [[Biblical canon]].)  Officially, Anglican teaching is that these books may be read in church for their instruction in morals, but not used to establish any doctrine. In recent years, prayer books (or &quot;alternate services&quot; books) of several countries have, out of deference to a greater agreement with Eastern [[Conciliarism]] (and a perceived greater respect accorded Anglicanism by Eastern Orthodoxy than by Roman Catholicism), instituted a number of historically Eastern and [[Oriental Orthodox]] elements in their liturgies, including replacing the [[Gloria in excelsis]] with the [[Trisagion]] and deleting the [[filioque]] from the [[Creed]]. 

For their part, those Anglicans who emphasise the Reformed-Protestant nature of the Church stress the Reformation themes of [[Salvation#Christian views of salvation|salvation]] by grace through faith, the two dominical sacraments of the Gospel, and Scripture as containing all that is necessary to salvation in an explicit sense. 

The range of Anglican belief and practice became particularly divisive during the 19th century, as the [[Anglo-Catholicism | Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] movements emphasised the more Catholic or the more Reformed sides of Anglican Christianity.  These groups or &quot;parties&quot; are still often equated with the terms &quot;High Church&quot; and &quot;Low Church&quot;, and these terms are commonly used to speak of the level of ceremony that is favoured. These terms are also used to discuss the theological place of the organised church within the Body of Christ.

The spectrum of Anglican beliefs and practice is too large to be fit into these labels.  Most Anglicans are broadly Evangelical and Catholic and, in fact, stress that Anglicanism, rightly understood, is western Christianity's &quot;[[Via Media]]&quot; (middle way) between what were considered medieval &quot;excesses&quot; of Roman Catholicism and the &quot;excesses&quot; of the fervent European Continental Protestantism, represented strongly by Geneva.  Via Media may also be understood as underscoring Anglicanism's preference for a communitarian and methodological approach to theological issues rather than either total relativism on the one hand or dogmatic absolutism on the other.

The nineteenth century saw new heights of intellectual activity in the Anglican Church. Since that time, the theological contributions of the Church to the wider spectrum of Christian thought have declined somewhat, though there is some resurgence on Anglicanism's theological left. Another recent trend has been the emergence of fundamentalism in some strands of Anglicanism. Fundamentalism, seen as an anti-intellectual movement, rejects all but the most literal readings of the Bible. This controversial doctrine is regarded by most as highly divisive, rejecting all prior tradition and is seen by its critics as a reactionary measure by those who cannot cope with the relativisation of truth that has been a predominant feature of the post-modernist epoch. Traditionally, Anglicanism had been associated with the English university systems and hence, the literary criticism produced in those organisations has been applied to the study of ancient scriptures, although not uncritically.

==Social issues==

A question of whether or not Christianity is a pacifist religion has remained a matter of debate for Anglicans. In 1937, the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship emerged as a distinct reform organisation, seeking to make pacifism a clearly defined part of Anglican theology. The group rapidly gained popularity amongst Anglican intellectuals, including [[Vera Brittain]], [[Evelyn Underhill]] and former British political leader [[George Lansbury]].

Whilst never actively endorsed by the Anglican Church, many Anglicans unofficially have adopted the Augustinian &quot;[[the Just War Theory|Just War]]&quot; doctrine. The Anglican Pacifist Fellowship remain highly active and rejects this doctrine. The Fellowship seeks to reform the Church by reintroducing the [[pacifism]] inherent in the beliefs of many of the earliest Christians and present in their interpretation of Christ's [[Sermon on the Mount]]. Confusing the matter all the more however, is that the 37th Article of Religion states clearly that &quot;it is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to wear weapons, and serve in the wars.&quot;

==Religious life==

A small yet influential aspect of Anglicanism is its [[religious order]]s of [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s. Shortly after the beginning of the revival of the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Catholic Movement]] in the Church of England, there was felt to be a need for some Anglican [[Sisters of Charity]]. In the 1840s Mother [[Priscilla Lydia Sellon]] became the first woman to take the vows of religion in communion with the [[Province of Canterbury]] since the Reformation, and a series of letters were exchanged publically between her and the Rev. James [[Spurrell]], Vicar of Great Shelford, Cambs., who criticised Miss Sellon's Sisters of Mercy. From the 1840s and throughout the next hundred years, religious orders for both men and women proliferated in the [[UK]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[India]], as well as in various countries of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and the [[Pacific]].

Anglican religious life at one time boasted hundreds of orders and communities, and thousands of [[religious]]. An important aspect of Anglican religious life is that most communities of both men and women lived their lives consecrated to [[God]] under the [[vow]]s of [[poverty]], [[sexual abstinence|chastity]] and [[obedience]] (or in [[Benedictine]] communities, Stability, Conversion of Life, and Obedience) by practicing a mixed life of reciting the full eight services of the [[Breviary]] in choir, along with a daily [[Eucharist]], plus service to the poor. The mixed life, combining aspects of the [[contemplative order]]s and the [[active order]]s remains to this day a hallmark of Anglican religious life.

Since the 1960s there has been a sharp falling off in the numbers of religious in most parts of the Anglican Communion, just as in the Roman Catholic Church. Many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single convent or monastery comprised of elderly men or women. In the last few decades of the 20th century, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct.

There are however, still several thousand Anglican religious working today in approximately 200 communities around the world.

The most significant growth has been in the [[Melanesia]]n countries of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[Melanesian Brotherhood]], founded at [[Tabalia]], [[Guadalcanal (Pacific Ocean island)|Guadalcanal]], in [[1925]] by Ini Kopuria, is now the largest Anglican Community in the world with over 450 [[monk|brother]]s in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, the [[Philippines]] and the United Kingdom. The [[Sisters of the Church]], started by Mother Emily Ayckbown in England in 1870, has more [[nun|sisters]] in the Solomons than all their other communities. The [[Community of the Sisters of Melanesia]], started in 1980 by Sister Nesta Tiboe, is a growing community of women throughout the Solomon Islands. The [[Society of Saint Francis]], founded as a union of various [[Franciscan]] orders in the 1920s, has experienced great growth in the Solomon Islands. Other communities of religious have been started by Anglicans in Papua New Guinea and in Vanuatu. Most Melanesian Anglican religious are in their early to mid 20s -- vows may be temporary and it is generally assumed that brothers, at least, will leave and marry in due course -- making the average age 40 to 50 years younger than their brothers and sisters in other countries. This growth is especially surprising because celibacy was not regarded as a Melanesian virtue; on the other hand, it is perhaps more accurate to conceptualise Melanesian religious as youth volunteers than as monastic orders on the medieval European model.

'''Athens''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Αθήνα ''Athína'' [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/a'θina/}}) is the [[capital]] of [[Greece]] and one of the most famous cities in the world. Modern Athens is a large and cosmopolitan city; Ancient Athens was a powerful [[city-state]] and renowned centre of learning. It was named after its  goddess from ancient Greek mythology, [[Athena]]. Athens is located at {{coor dm|38|00|N|23|43|E|}} (38.00°, 23.72°).

The metropolitan area of Athens is home to some 3.9 million people. Currently the city (metropolitan area) is growing northwards and eastwards across [[Attica]] (Greater Athens). Athens is the dominant centre of economic, cultural, and political life in Greece today.

Ancient Athens has often been called the cradle of [[Western civilization]] due to the impact of its cultural and political achievements during the 4th and 5th centuries BC. This heritage has left it with a number of ancient buildings, monuments and artworks, the most famous being the [[Parthenon]] on the [[Acropolis]], widely regarded as one of the finest examples of Classical Greek art and architecture. Many of these cultural landmarks were renovated for the [[2004 Olympic Games]].

==Name==
{{nameWikt}}

In [[ancient Greek|ancient]] [[Greek language|Greek]], the name of Athens was '''{{Polytonic|&amp;#7944;θ&amp;#8134;ναι}}'''-''Athenai'', plural of {{Polytonic|&amp;#7944;θηνά}}-''Athene'', the Greek name of the Goddess [[Athena]]. The city's name was used in the plural like those of {{Polytonic|Θ&amp;#8134;βαι}}-''Thebai'' ([[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]) and {{Polytonic|Μυκ&amp;#8134;ναι}}-''Mykenai'' ([[Mycenae]]) because it consisted of several parts. In the [[19th century]], this name was formally re-adopted as the city's name. Since the official abandonment of [[Katharevousa]] Greek in the [[1970s]], however, the popular form ''Athínai'' has become the city's official name. See also a list of [[Names of European cities in different languages#A|alternative names]] for Athens.

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Athens]]''
[[Image:Map Athens MKL1888.png|thumb|1888 German map of Athens]]
Athens was the leading city in Greece during the greatest period of Greek civilization during the [[1st millennium BC]]. During the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Greece (roughly [[500 BC]] to [[300 BC]]) it was the world's leading cultural, commercial and intellectual center, and indeed it is in the ideas and practices of ancient Athens that what we now call &quot;Western civilization&quot; has its origins. In 431 B.C, Athens went to war with another city-state, Sparta. Due to its losses during a plague, Athens was defeated by Sparta, and its walls were pulled down.

The schools of philosophy were closed in AD [[529]] by the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]], which disapproved of the schools' [[Paganism|pagan]] thinking. During the Byzantine era, Athens gradually lost a great deal of status and, by the time of the [[Crusades]], it was already reduced to a provincial town. It faced a crushing blow between the 13th and 15th centuries, when the city was fought over by the Greek Byzantines and the 'French' and Italian [[Crusaders]]. In [[1458]] the city fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]] under Sultan [[Mehmed II|Mehmet II the Conqueror]]. As the Emperor entered the city, he was greatly struck by the beauty of its ancient monuments and issued a [[firman]] (imperial decree) that Athens' ruins not be disturbed, on pain of death. The [[Parthenon]] was in fact converted into a [[mosque]] and therefore preserved.

Despite the Sultan's good intentions to preserve Athens as a model Ottoman provincial capital, the city's population went into decline and conditions worsened as the Ottoman Empire declined from the late 17th Century. As time went by, the Ottoman administration slackened its care for Athens' old buildings; the Parthenon/Mosque was used as a warehouse for ammunition during the Venetian siege of Athens in [[1687]], and consequently the temple was severely damaged when a Venetian [[projectile|shell]] targeted the site and set off several casks of gunpowder stored inside the Parthenon/Mosque.

The Ottoman Empire relinquished control of Athens after the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The city was inhabited by just around 5,000 people at the time it was adopted as the capital of the newly established Kingdom of Greece on [[18 September]] [[1834]]. During the next few decades the city was rebuilt into a modern city adhering mainly to the [[neoclassical architecture|Neoclassic style]]. In [[1896]] Athens became the first host city of the revived [[1896 Summer Olympics]].The next large expansion occurred in the [[1920s]] when suburbs were created to house Greek refugees from [[Asia Minor]]. During [[World War II]] the city was occupied by [[Germany]] and fared badly in the war's later years. After the war the city started to grow again, this time into a concrete jungle, seeing the near total destruction of its Neoclassical heritage.

==Location and setting==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:ZAPPION.jpg|thumb|left|The Zappion; a conference centre designed by [[Theofil Hansen]] in 1870, is surrounded by extensive gardens]] --&gt;

[[Image:Mk01n101.jpg|thumbnail|The Academy, designed by [[Theofil Hansen]] and completed in 1885, is flanked by the National Library and the University of Athens.]]

Along with its numerous suburbs, Athens has a population of about 3.9 million representing approximately one third of the total population of Greece. Athens grew rapidly in the years following [[World War II]] until ca. 1980 and suffered from overcrowding and traffic congestion. Greek entry into the [[EEC]] in [[1981]] brought new, unprecedented investment into the city along with problems of increasingly worsening industrial congestion and air pollution. Throughout the 1990s the city's authorities undertook a series of decisive measures in order to combat the smog which used to form over the city, particularly during the hottest days of the year. Even though Athens is considered the most polluted capital in Europe, those measures proved to be successful and nowadays smog or ''nefos'' in Greek is less of an issue for Athens, even when temperatures soar above 40 C. As far as the situation with the traffic congestion is concerned, the latter has been considerably improved, even though it is not resolved as yet. Part of this improvement is attributed both to the transformation of the once highly problematic Kiffissos Avenue into a modern, 8 lane urban motorway that stretches for more than 11 km along the ancient [[Kifissos]] River, linking many of Athens' western suburbs, from [[Peristeri]] to the port of [[Piraeus]] and to the construction of the [[Attiki Odos]] motorway. Nevertheless Athens is still not a driver-friendly city. Today Athens is a vibrant metropolis with improved infrastructure, world-class ancient monuments and museums, a legendary nightlife and increasing number of shopping malls.

Athens sprawls across the central plain of [[Attica]], which is bound by Mount [[Aegaleo]] in the west, Mount [[Parnitha]] in the north, Mount [[Penteli]] in the northeast, Mount [[Hymettus]] in the east, and the [[Saronic Gulf]] in the southwest. Athens has expanded to cover the entire plain making it difficult to significantly grow further in size in the future due to the forementioned existing natural boundaries. The geomorphology of the city frequently causes the so called [[temperature inversion]] phenomenon that was partly responsible for the air pollution problems Athens faced in the recent past. ([[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] has similar geomorphology and similar problems).

The ancient site of the city is centered on the rocky hill of the [[Acropolis]]. In ancient times the port of [[Piraeus]] (modern name Pireas) was a separate city, but it has now been absorbed into greater Athens.

The centre of the city is [[Syntagma Square]] (Constitution Square), site of the former Royal Palace, now the [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek Parliament]] and other 19th century public buildings. This is essentially the core of the city, the place where most of the famous ancient monuments are located, all within a radius of 2 km.
[[Image:Panorama_of_Athens.jpg|thumbnail|320px|Panorama of Athens, showing the [[Acropolis]] and other ancient sites.]] 
Athens was the host of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. Athens was also the host of the [[1896 Summer Olympics]] and of the [[1906 Summer Olympics|1906 Intercalated Games]].

==Tourist attractions==
Athens has been a popular [[tourist destination]] even since antiquity. Visitors from all over the globe have always been eager to visit its famous ancient monuments. Over the past decade, the infrastructure and social amenities of Athens have been radically improved as a result of the city's successful bid to stage the [[2004]] [[Olympic Games]]. The Greek state, aided by the [[European Union|E.U.]], has poured money into infrastructure projects such as the new, state of the art [[Eleftherios Venizelos Airport|&quot;Eleftherios Venizelos&quot; International Airport]], the massive expansion of the [[Athens Metro|Metro]] system, and the new [[Attiki Odos]] ring-road. As a result, the numbers of international visitors are only expected to rise even further in the coming years. Currently, Athens is the 6th most visited capital in Europe.

Athens  is home to a vast number of 5 and 4 star hotels, some of which were refurbished ahead of the 2004 Olympics. Entire parts of the downtown area have also been redeveloped under a masterplan called &quot;Unification of Archaeological Sites of Athens&quot; [http://www.astynet.gr/index.asp]. In one of the most important projects of the scheme, the famous Dionysiou Aeropagitou street has been pedestrianized thus forming a fascinating scenic route. The route starts from the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus]] at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the [[Acropolis]] near [[Plaka]] and finishes just outside the [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in [[Theseum]]. This remarkable route provides the visitors breathtaking views of the [[Parthenon]] and the [[ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]] (the meeting point of ancient Athenians), away from the bustle and hustle of the city centre. Near Syntagma Square (described above) stands the highly impressive [[Kallimarmaro]] Stadium, the place where the first modern [[1896 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] took place in [[1896]]. It is a replica of the ancient Athens Stadium. It holds a special interest, not only for romantic reasons but also because it is the only major stadium (60,000 spectators) made entirely of white marble from [[Penteli]], the same as the one used for the construction of the Parthenon.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Kallimarmaron.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Kallimarmaro Stadium of Athens]] --&gt;
The city's classic museums like the National Archaeological [[Museum]] at Patission Street (which holds the world's greatest collection of [[Greek art]]), the Benaki Museum in Piraeus Street (including its new Islamic Art branch) [http://www.benaki.gr], the Byzantine Museum, or the Museum of Cycladic Art in the Kolonaki district (strongly recommended for its collection of elegant white metamodern figures, more than 3,000 years old) [http://www.cycladic-m.gr], were all renovated ahead of the 2004 Olympics. A new Acropolis Museum is being built [http://www.culture.gr/2/21/215/21502/e21509c.html] in the central Makriyanni district according to a design by acclaimed Swiss-french architect [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Not to be missed is also the very impressive Athens [[Planetarium]] [http://www.eugenfound.edu.gr], considered to be among the world's best.

The old campus of the [[University of Athens]], located in the middle section of Panepistimiou Avenue, is one of the finest buildings in the city. This combined with the adjacent National Library and the Athens Academy form the imposing &quot;Athens Trilogy&quot;, built in the mid-19th century. However, most of the university's functions have been moved to a much larger, modern campus located in the eastern suburb of [[Zografou|Zográfou]]. The second most significant academic institution of the city is the [[National Technical University of Athens|Athens Polytechnic School]] (''Ethniko Metsovio Politechnio''), located in Patission Street. More than 20 students were killed inside the School in [[November 17]],[[1973]] during the [[Athens Polytechnic Uprising]] against the military junta that ruled the nation from [[April 21]], [[1967]] untill [[July 23]], [[1974]].

'''Entertainment''' and '''night life''': Athens is full of possibilities, catering for most tastes and cultures. To begin with, it has a large number of multiplex, but especially unique, open air garden cinemas; it enjoys more theatres than any other European city (including ancient marble ones that are home to the Athens Festival [http://www.hellenicfestival.gr/site/index_en.htm] from May to October) and many music venues including a state of the art [[music]] hall known as the &quot;Megaron Moussikis&quot; [http://www.megaron.gr] that attracts world-famous artists all year round. The Athens coastline, extending from the major commercial port of [[Piraeus]] to the southernmost suburb of Vouliagmeni for more than 25 km, is also connected to the city centre with a (very slow) tram and it boasts a series of high class restaurants, cafes, exciting music venues and sports facilities. In addition, Athens is packed with trendy and fashionable bars and nightclubs that are literally crowded by the city's youth on a daily basis. Especially during the summer, the southern elegant suburbs of [[Glyfada]], [[Voula]] and [[Vouliagmeni]] become home to countless such places, situated all along Poseidonos and Alkyonidon Avenues. 

Turning now to the city centre, the Psiri neighborhood - aka Athens' 'meat packing district'- has acquired many new mainstream bars, thus becoming a hotspot for many glitratti. It also features a number of live music restaurants called &quot;rebetadika&quot;, after [[rebetiko]], a unique kind of music that blossomed in [[Syros]] and Athens from the 1920's till the 1960's. [[Rebetiko]] is admired by many, therefore virtually every night rebetadika get crammed by people of all ages that will sing, dance and drink wine until the dawn. [[Plaka]] remains the traditional top tourist destination, with many [[taverna]]s featuring 'traditional' music, but the food, though very good, is often more expensive compared to other parts of the city. Plaka, lying just beneath the Acropolis, is famous for its numerous neoclassic buildings, making it one of the most scenic districts in central Athens. Monastiraki, on the other hand, is famous for its string of small tourist shops as well as its crowded flea market and the tavernas that specialize in [[souvlaki]]. Another district notably famous for its student-crammed, stylish cafes is [[Theseum]], lying just west of  [[Monastiraki]]. Theseum, or Thission is home to the remarkable ancient [[Temple of Hephaestus]], standing on top of a small hill. The Gazi area, one of the latest in full redevelopment, is located around a historic gas factory in downtown Athens, that has been converted into the ''Technopolis'' (Athens's new cultural multiplex) for all the family and has a number of expensive small clubs, bars and restaurants as well as Athens' nascent gay ;village'.

The chic [[Kolonaki]] area, near Syntagma Square, is full of boutiques catering to well-heeled customers by day and bars and restaurants by night. Ermou Street, an approximately 1 km pedestrian road connecting [[Syntagma Square]] to [[Monastiraki]], has traditionally been considered a consumer paradise for both the Athenians and foreign tourists. Full of fashion shops  and shopping centers featuring most international brands, it has become one of the most expensive roads in [[Europe]]. Huge malls such as the &quot;Attica&quot; mall in Panepistimiou Avenue and &quot;The Mall Athens&quot; [http://www.themallathens.gr] located in the classy northern suburb of [[Maroussi]] also offer an enormous variety of international selections that can totally satisfy even the most demanding customer. Some central areas (mostly just south of [[Omonoia Square]]) are mainly peopled by immigrants and are therefore full of colorful ethnic restaurants and shops.

Casinos operate on both Mount Parnitha, some 30 km from downtown Athens (accessible by car or cable car) and the nearby town of [[Loutraki]] (accessible by car via the Athens - Corinth National Highway or the suburban railway). An entirely new attraction is the massively upgraded main Olympic Complex (known by its Greek acronym OAKA). The whole area has been redeveloped under designs by the Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]] with steel arches, lanscaped gardens, fountains, futuristic passages and a landmark new blue glass roof which was added to the main Stadium. A second olympic complex, next to the sea at the beach of [[Kallithea]] (Faliron), also boasts futuristic stadiums, shops and an elevated esplanade.

Many of Athens' southern suburbs (such as [[Alimos]], [[Palaio Faliro]], [[Elliniko]], [[Voula]], [[Vouliagmeni]] and [[Vari]]) host a number of beautiful, sandy beaches, most of which are  operated by the Hellenic Tourism Organization [http://www.gnto.gr]. This means that one has to pay a fee in order to get in. None the less, this fee is not expensive in most cases and it includes a number of related, convenient services like parking facilities, coctail drinks and umbrellas. These beaches are extremely popular in the summer by both Athenians and foreign tourists. The city is also surrounded by four easily accessible mountains (Parnitha and Penteli to the north, Hemmettus to the southeast and Egaleo to the west). Mount Parnitha, in particular, is the tallest of all (1,453 m) and it has been declared a protected National Park. It has tens of well-marked paths, gorges, springs, torrents and caves and you may even meet deer or bears while exploring its dense forests. Hiking and mountain biking in all four mountains have been and still remain popular outdoor activities for many Athenians. What is more, [[Lykavittos]] is the tallest hill of the city that, according to an ancient legend, was actually a boulder thrown down by Goddess Athena. Located in the city center, near Alexandras' and Vassilisis Sofia's Avenues, it offers magnificent, literally breathtaking views of sprawling Athens that lies underneath. On top of it, stands the picturesque St. George's church which is definitely a must-see. The nearby islands of [[Salamis Island|Salamina]], [[Aegina|Aigina]], [[Poros]], [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]] and [[Spetses]] are also sites of spectacular natural beauty and historical architecture. Work is underway to transform the grounds of the old Athens Airport - named [[Ellinikon International Airport|Hellinikon]] - in the southern suburbs into a massive landscaped park (considered to be the largest in Europe when ready). The Athens municipality maintains a site of tourist interest: http://www.cityofathens.gr/

==Transportation==

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Attiki_odos_flyover.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Attiki Odos Motorway]] --&gt;
The [[public transport]] system in Athens consists of [[bus]][http://www.oasa.gr], [[metro]][http://www.ametro.gr/], [[tram]][http://linuxweb.internet.gr/tramsa/html/gr/index.php] and suburban railway [http://www.proastiakos.gr] services.

The [[Athens Metro]] is one of the most modern and efficient systems in the world. It has four lines, three of which are distinguished by the colours used in maps and signs (green, blue and red). The green line, which is the oldest and for the most part runs on the ground, connects [[Piraeus]] to [[Kifissia]]. The other two lines were constructed mainly during the 1990s and the first sections opened in [[January]] [[2000]]. They run entirely underground. The blue line runs from [[Monastiraki]] to [[Doukissis Plakentias]] and the [[Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]], and the red line from [[Aghios Antonios]] to [[Aghios Dimitrios]]. Extensions to both lines are under construction, most notably westwards to Egaleo and eastwards to the Old Hellinikon Airport East Terminal (future Metropolitan Park). The fourth line is the Proastiakos (suburban) which runs from the [[Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]] to Athens Central train station. The whole network is managed by three different companies (ISAP line 1)[http://www.isap.gr], Attiko Metro (lines 2 &amp; 3) and Proastiakos (line 4).

The whole Metro system of Athens is currently 91 km long. The mass transport system in Athens has been drastically improved and expanded in the recent years, up until [[1999]] the length of the system was of just 25 km (23 stations) and comprised of only one line. It's expected that by 2009 it will reach 124 km (72 stations), after the construction of the current phase of expansions is completed.

The bus service consists of a network of lines on which normal buses, [[trolley bus|electric buses]], and natural gas buses run (the largest fleet of natural gas run buses in Europe). There are plenty of bus lines serving Athens and the suburbs, and they link the centre of the city with most of the suburbs and neighborhoods.  

The tram runs from Syntagma Square to [[Palaio Faliro]], where the line splits in two branches, towards [[Glyfada]] and Neo Faliro. Both Syntagma - Palaio Faliro - Neo Faliro and the Glyfada branch opened on [[19 July]] [[2004]]. Further extensions are planned towards [[Piraeus]] and Vouliagmeni.

There are many [[taxicab|taxis]] in Athens, which  can be recognised by the yellow colour of the vehicles. They are quite cheap and during rush hours it is considered normal to hail a taxi even when it is in service (although, strictly speaking, this is forbidden); in that case, if the one halting it happens to go to the same direction as the customer and the customer does not mind (although this is never brought up or an issue), he is also allowed in, and each one pays normally as if they were the only customer.

Athens is served, since [[March]] [[2001]], by the [[Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]] at [[Spata]], east of the city, about a 45-minute taxi ride from the city centre. There is also an express bus service connecting the airport to the metro system and 2 express bus services connecting the airport to [[Piraeus]] port and the city centre respectively. Athens is also the hub of the Greek National Railway System, and ferries from [[Piraeus]] Port travel to all Greek islands.

There are two motorways that travel to the west towards [[Patra]]: ([[Greece Interstate 8A|GR-8A]], [[E94]]) and to the north towards [[Thessaloniki]] ([[Greece Interstate 1|GR-1]], [[E75]]). In [[2001]]-[[2004]] a ring road toll-motorway ([[Attiki Odos]]) was gradually completed, which extends from [[Eleusis|Elefsina]] on the west to the airport after circling the city from the north, plus another from [[Kaisariani]] to [[Glyka Nera]] where it meets the main road for [[Eleusis]] and the airport. Its total length is now about 70 km, up from 18 km in March 2001 when the first section opened to traffic. There are about 21 exits and 4 junctions, up from 8.

See [[Athens Mass Transit System]] for more on this topic.

==Municipality==
[[Image:Athens_seal.jpg|thumb|100px||right|'''Municipality of Athens''' Seal]]
The modern city of Athens consists of what were formerly distinct towns and villages which gradually expanded and merged into a single large metropolis; most of this expansion occurred in the second half of the 20th century. Greater Athens is now divided into 54 municipalities, the largest of which is the '''Municipality of Athens''' or ''Dimos Athinaion'', with about 750,000 people (the next largest are [[Piraeus|Municipality of Piraeus]], [[Peristeri|Municipality of Peristeri]] and [[Peristeri|Municipality of Kallithea]]). ''Athens'' can therefore refer either to the entire metropolitan area or to the Municipality of Athens. Each of the municipalities of Athens has an elected district council and a directly elected mayor. Mrs. [[Dora Bakoyanni]] of the conservative [[New Democracy]] party was [[Mayor of Athens]] from [[1 January]] [[2003]] until [[15 February]] [[2006]], when she joined Greek Cabinet as Minister of Foreign affairs. She was the 76th Mayor of Athens and the first female to hold the post in the history of the city. She was replaced by Theodoros Mpehrakis.
The Municipality of Athens is divided into 7 ''municipal districts'' or ''demotika diamerismata''. The 7-district division however is mainly used for administrative purposes , while for Athenians the most popular way of dividing the city proper is through its ''neighborhoods'' (usually referred to as areas in English), each with its own distinct history and characteristics. 
For someone unfamiliar with Athens, getting to know about these ''neighborhoods'' can often come very handy for exploring and understanding the city.

==Olympics 2004==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:ceremony4.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Scene from the opening ceremony of the Athens Olympics 2004]] --&gt;
[[Image:3D View of Athens.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Simulated view of Athens from above]]
Athens was awarded the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] on [[September 5]], [[1997]] in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], after having lost a previous bid to host the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the modern [[Olympic Games]], to [[Atlanta]], [[USA]]. It was to be the second time Athens had hosted the Olympic Games, the first being in [[1896]].

In [[1997]], Athens made an improved bid based largely on an appeal to Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated [[Rome]], 66 [[vote]]s to 41. Before this, [[Buenos Aires]], [[Stockholm]], and [[Cape Town]], had already been eliminated from consideration after receiving fewer votes.

In the first three years of preparations, the [[International Olympic Committee]] repeatedly expressed  concerns over the status of progress of construction work of the new Olympic venues. In [[2000]] the Organizing Committee's president was replaced by [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]], who was the president of the Bidding Committe back in [[1997]], and preparations began at an accelerated pace. Although the heavy cost was criticized, as is not unusual with Olympic preparations, Athens was transformed into a modern city that enjoys state-of-the-art technology in transportation and urban development. Some of the most modern sporting venues in the world were created, almost all of which were fully ready on schedule. The 2004 Games were adjudged a huge success, as both security and organization were exceptionally good and only a few visitors reported minor problems, mainly concerning transportation or accommodation issues. Essentially, the only notable problem was a somewhat sparse attendance of some preliminary events, during the first days of competition. Eventually, however, a total of more than 3.2 million tickets were sold [http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:nBu-MEzPTloJ:www.worldmayor.com/results05/profile_bakoyannis.html+2004+athens+olympics+tickets+3.2+million&amp;hl=en], which was higher than any other Olympics with the exception of [[Sydney]] (more than 5 million tickets were sold there in [[2000]]).

'''Anguilla''' is a [[British overseas territory]] in the [[Caribbean]], the most northerly of the [[Leeward Islands]] in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It consists of 5 islands, with the capital, [[The Valley, Anguilla|The Valley]] situated on the main island of Anguilla. The total area of the territory is 102 square kilometres (39.4 [[square mile|mi²]]), with a population of approximately 14,000 in 2005.

==History==
{{main|History of {{PAGENAME}}}}

First colonized by English settlers in 1650, Anguilla was incorporated into a single British dependency along with the neighbouring islands of [[Saint Kitts]] and [[Nevis]] in the early 19th century, much to the objections of many Anguillans. In 1980, however, Anguilla formally withdrew from the territory, becoming a separate British dependency, which it remains.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of {{PAGENAME}}}}

Executive authority is invested in [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]], who is represented in the territory by the [[Governor of Anguilla|Governor]]. The Governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the British Government. Defence and Foreign Affairs remain the responsibility of the [[United Kingdom]].

The constitution of Anguilla came into force in 1982, amended in 1990. The head of the government is the [[Chief Minister of Anguilla|Chief Minister]] who is appointed by the Governor. The legislative branch consists of a [[unicameral parliament]], the House of Assembly, made up of 11 members. Elections are held for 7 seats in the House of Assembly, 2 members being ex-offcio and 2 appointed. 

The current Governor is [[Alan Huckle]], appointed in May 2004. The current Chief Minister is [[Osbourne Fleming]] following the victory of the United Front in elections held during February 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AshmoreandCartierIslands.png|frame|Ashmore and Cartier Islands]]
The '''Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands''' are two groups of small low-lying uninhabited tropical [[island]]s in the [[Indian Ocean]] situated on the edge of the [[continental shelf]] north-west of [[Australia]] and south of the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Rote Island|Roti]] at {{coor dm|12|14|S|123|5|E|}}.

The territory includes '''Ashmore Reef''' (West, Middle, and East Islets) and '''Cartier Island''' (70 km east) with, a total area of 199.45 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; within the reefs and including the [[lagoons]], and 114,400 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of dry land. While they have a total of 74.1 km of shoreline, measured along the outer edge of the reef, there are no ports or harbors, only offshore anchorage. Nearby '''Hibernia Reef''', 42 km Northeast of Ashmore Reef, is not part of the territory. It has no permanently dry land area, although large parts of the reef become exposed during low tide.

*Ashmore Reef 155.40 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area within reef (including lagoon)
**West Islet, 51,200 m&amp;sup2; land area;
**Middle Islet, 21,200 m&amp;sup2; land area;
**East Islet, 25,000 m&amp;sup2; land area;
*Cartier Reef (44.03 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area within reef (including lagoon)
**Cartier Island, 17,000 m&amp;sup2; land area;

There is an automatic weather station on West Islet.

The territory is administered from [[Canberra]] by the Australian Department of the Environment and Heritage.  The data code is AT.  Defence is the responsibility of Australia, with periodic visits by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. The islands are visited by seasonal caretakers.

The '''Ashmore Reef Marine National Nature Reserve''' was established in August [[1983]]. It is of significant [[biodiversity]] value as it is in the flow of the [[Indonesian throughflow]] [[ocean current|current]] from the [[Pacific Ocean]] through the [[Malay archipelago|Indonesian Archipelago]] to the [[Indian Ocean]]. It is also in a surface current west from the [[Arafura Sea]] and [[Timor Sea]]. There are 14 distinct species of [[sea snake]] in the area, more than in any other area. There is also an unusually high level of [[species diversity]] of [[coral]], [[mollusk]]s, and [[fish]]. A memorandum of understanding between the Australian and Indonesian governments allows Indonesian fishermen access to their traditional fishing grounds within the region, subject to limits.

'''Cartier Island Marine Reserve''' includes the entire sand cay of Cartier Island, the reef surrounding it, the ocean for a 7.2 km radius around the island, and 1000 m below the seafloor. It was proclaimed in [[2000]].

There is no economic activity in the Territory.

As Ashmore Reef is the closest point of Australian territory to Indonesia, it has been a popular target for [[people smugglers]] to take [[asylum seekers]] to Australia. They were transported at great personal risk and expense in leaky fishing boats and dumped on the island, expecting to be rescued by Australia and granted [[refugee]] status there. As Australia was not the [http://refugeethesaurus.org/hms/refugee_obj.php?type=terms&amp;id=2143 country of first asylum] for these &quot;[[boat people]]&quot;, Australia did not consider it had a responsibility to accept them. A number of things were done to discourage the practice such as attempting to have the people smugglers arrested in Indonesia; [[Mandatory detention in Australia|mandatory detention]] of all arrivals until their status could be determined; the so-called [[Pacific Solution]] of processing them in third countries; and finally excising these and many other small islands from the [[Australian migration zone]].

'''Acoustic theory''' is the field relating to mathematical description of [[sound]] [[waves]]. It is derived from [[fluid dynamics]]. See [[acoustics]] for the [[engineering]] approach.

The propagation of sound waves in air can be modeled by an equation of motion (conservation of [[momentum]]) and an equation of continuity (conservation of [[mass]]).  With some simplifications, in particular constant density, they can be given as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;\rho_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}, t) + \nabla p(\mathbf{x}, t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t} p(\mathbf{x}, t) + \rho_0 c^2 \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}, t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p(\mathbf{x}, t)&lt;/math&gt; is the acoustic pressure and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}, t)&lt;/math&gt; is the acoustic fluid velocity vector, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of spatial coordinates &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time, &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; is the static density of air and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of sound in air.

'''Alexander Mackenzie''', [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC]] ([[January 28]], [[1822]] &amp;ndash; [[April 17]], [[1892]]), a building contractor and writer, was the second [[Prime Minister of Canada]] from [[November 7]], [[1873]] to [[October 8]], [[1878]].

He was born in [[Logierait]], [[Perth and Kinross]], [[Scotland]]. He [[emigrate]]d to [[Canada]] in [[1842]] after completing an education in [[public schools]] at [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Moulin]], and [[Dunkeld]], Scotland. Mackenzie married Helen Neil ([[1826]]-[[1852]]) in [[1845]] and with her had three children, with only one girl surviving infancy. In [[1853]], he married [[Jane Sym]] ([[1825]]-[[1893]]).

When the [[John A. Macdonald|Macdonald]] government fell due to the [[Pacific scandal]] in 1873, the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], had to call on someone to form a government. There was no clear leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]].  Mackenzie was the fourth person called upon, and the first to accept, the post of Prime Minister.  Mackenzie formed a government and then asked the Governor General to call an  [[Canadian federal election, 1874|election for January 1874]]. The Liberals won, and Mackenzie remained prime minister until the [[Canadian federal election, 1878|1878 election]] when Macdonald's [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]] returned to power with a [[majority government]].

As Prime Minister, Alexander Mackenzie strove to reform and simplify the machinery of government. He introduced the [[secret ballot]]; created the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]; established the [[Royal Military College]] of Canada in [[Kingston, Ontario]] in [[1874]]; created the Office of the Auditor General in 1878; and struggled to launch the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|national railway]]. After his government's defeat, Mackenzie remained [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] until [[1880]], when he relinquished the party leadership to [[Edward Blake]]. 

At the time, it was customary for the [[British monarch]] to [[knight]] all Canadian Prime Ministers. Alexander Mackenzie declined all offers of a British [[knighthood]].

He died in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], from a stroke that resulted from hitting his head during a fall. He is buried in the Lakeview Cemetery, [[Sarnia, Ontario]].

== Supreme Court Appointments ==
Mackenzie appointed the following Justices to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]:
* Sir [[William Buell Richards]] ([[Chief Justice of Canada|Chief Justice]]) - ([[September 30]], [[1875]] - [[January 10]], [[1879]])
* Sir [[William Johnstone Ritchie]] - ([[September 30]], [[1875]] - [[September 25]], [[1892]])
* Sir [[Samuel Henry Strong]] - ([[September 30]], [[1875]] - [[November 18]], [[1902]])
* [[Jean-Thomas Taschereau]] - ([[September 30]], [[1875]] - [[October 6]], [[1878]])
* [[Telesphore Fournier]] - ([[September 30]], [[1875]] - [[September 12]], [[1895]])
* [[William Alexander Henry]] - ([[September 30]], [[1875]] - [[May 3]], [[1888]])
* Sir [[Henri Elzear Taschereau]] - ([[October 7]], [[1878]] - [[May 2]], [[1906]])

== Helen Neil Mackenzie ==
'''Helen Neil Mackenzie''' ([[October 21]], [[1826]]-[[January 4]], [[1852]]) was the first wife of Alexander Mackenzie. She had three children, and died after being married to Mackenzie for seven years. Helen and Alexander only had one child (two other children died in infancy), a girl, named Mary Mackenzie. It was because of Helen, who previously emigrated to Canada with her family, that Alexander himself came to Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Annexation''' ([[Latin]] ''ad'', to, and ''nexus'', joining) is the legal incorporation of some territory into another geo-political entity (either adjacent or non-contiguous). Usually, it is implied that the territory and population being ''annexed'' is the smaller, more peripheral or weaker of the two merging entities. It can also imply a certain measure of coercion, [[expansionism]] or [[unilateralism]] on the part of the stronger of the merging entities. Because of this, more positive words like [[political union]] or [[reunification]] are sometimes preferred. 

== More detailed overview ==

Annexation may be the consequence of a voluntary cession from one state to another through purchase or other treaty, or of conversion from a protectorate or sphere of influence, or occupation through military conquest. A [[city]] might annex unincorporated areas or a [[country]] might annex other [[disputed territories]]. The assumption of a protectorate over another state, or of a [[sphere of influence]], is not strictly annexation, the latter implying the complete displacement in the annexed territory of the government or state by which it was previously ruled. 

In [[international relations]] the term ''annexation'' is usually applied when the emphasis is placed on the fact that territorial possession is achieved by force and unilaterally rather than through [[treaty|treaties]] or negotiations. The cession of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] to [[Germany]] by [[France]], although brought about by the war of 1870, was for the purposes of international law a voluntary cession. Under the treaty of [[December 17]], [[1885]], between the French Republic and the queen of [[Madagascar]], a French protectorate was established over this island. In 1896 this protectorate was converted by France into an annexation, and Madagascar then became &quot;French territory.&quot;  The formal annexation of [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] by [[Austria]] ([[October 5]], [[1908]]) was an unauthorized conversion of an &quot;occupation&quot; authorized by the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] (1878), which had, however, for years operated as a ''de facto'' annexation. A case of conquest was that effected by the [[South African War]] (Second Boer War)  of 1899–1902, in which the [[Transvaal Republic]] and the [[Orange Free State]] were extinguished, first ''de facto'' by occupation of the whole of their territory, and then ''[[de jure]]'' by terms of surrender entered into by the [[Boer]] generals acting as a government. 

By annexation, as between civilized peoples, the annexing state takes over the whole succession with the rights and obligations attaching to the ceded territory, subject only to any modifying conditions contained in the treaty of cession. These, however, are binding only as between the parties to them. In the case of the annexation of the territories of the Transvaal republic and Orange Free State, a rather complicated situation arose out of the facts, on the one hand, that the ceding states closed their own existence and left no recourse to third parties against the previous ruling authority, and, on the other, that, having no means owing to the ''de facto'' [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation, of raising money by taxation, the dispossessed governments raised money by selling certain securities, more especially a large holding of shares in the [[South African Railway Company]], to neutral purchasers. The [[British government]] repudiated these sales as having been made by a government which the British government had already displaced. The question of at what point, in a war of conquest, the state succession becomes operative is one of great delicacy. As early as [[January 6]], [[1900]], the high commissioner at [[Cape Town]] issued a proclamation giving notice that the British government would &quot;not recognize as valid or effectual&quot; any conveyance, transfer or transmission of any property made by the government of the Transvaal republic or Orange Free State subsequently to [[October 10]], [[1899]], the date of the commencement of the war. A proclamation forbidding transactions with a state which might still be capable of maintaining its independence could obviously bind only those subject to the authority of the state issuing it. Like paper [[blockade]]s and fictitious occupations of territory, such premature proclamations are viewed by international jurists as not being ''jure gentium''. The proclamation was succeeded, on [[March 9]], [[1900]], by another of the high commissioner at Cape Town, reiterating the notice, but confining it to &quot;lands, railways, mines or mining rights.&quot; And on [[September 1]], [[1900]] Lord Roberts proclaimed at [[Pretoria]] the annexation of the territories of the Transvaal republic to the British dominions. That the war continued for nearly two years after this proclamation shows how fictitious the claim of annexation was. The difficulty which arose out of the transfer of the South African Railway shares held by the Transvaal government was satisfactorily terminated by the purchase by the British government of the total capital of the company from the different groups of [[shareholder]]s (see on this case, Sir Thomas Barclay, ''[[Law Quarterly Review]]'', July 1905; and Professor Westlake, in the same ''Review'', October 1905). 

In a judgment of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in 1899 (''Cook'' v. ''Sprigg'', A.C. 572), [[Lord Chancellor]] Halsbury made an important distinction as regards the obligations of state succession. The case in question was a claim of title against the [[Crown]], represented by the government of [[Cape Colony]]. It was made by persons holding a concession of certain rights in eastern [[Pondoland]] from a native chief. Before the grantees had taken up their grant by acts of possession, Pondoland was annexed to Cape Colony. The colonial government refused to recognize the grant on different grounds, the chief of them being that the concession conferred no legal rights before the annexation and therefore could confer none afterwards, a sufficiently good ground in itself. The judicial committee, however, rested its decision chiefly on the allegation that the acquisition of the territory was an act of state and that &quot;no municipal court had authority to enforce such an obligation&quot; as the duty of the new government to respect existing titles. &quot;It is no answer,&quot; said Lord Halsbury, &quot;to say that by the ordinary principles of international law private property is respected by the sovereign which accepts the cession and assumes the duties and legal obligations of the former sovereign with respect to such private property within the ceded territory. All that can be meant by such a proposition is that according to the well-understood rules of international law a change of sovereignty by cession ought not to affect private property, but no municipal tribunal has authority to enforce such an obligation. And if there is either an express or a well-understood bargain between the ceding potentate and the government to which the cession is made that private property shall be respected, that is only a bargain which can be enforced by sovereign against sovereign in the ordinary course of diplomatic pressure.&quot; In an editorial note on this case the ''Law Quarterly Review'' of January 1900 (p. 1), dissenting from the view of the judicial committee that &quot;no municipal tribunal has authority to enforce such an obligation,&quot; the writer observes that &quot;we can read this only as meant to lay down that, on the annexation of territory even by peaceable cession, there is a total abeyance of justice until the will of the annexing power is expressly made known; and that, although the will of that power is commonly to respect existing private rights, there is no rule or presumption to that effect of which any court must or indeed can take notice.&quot; So construed the doctrine is not only contrary to international law, but according to so authoritative an exponent of the common law as Sir F. Pollock, there is no warrant for it in English [[common law]]. 

An interesting point of [[United States]] constitutional law arose out of the [[cession]] of the [[Philippines]] to the United States, through the fact that the [[Constitution of the United States|federal constitution]] does not lend itself to the exercise by the federal congress of unlimited powers, such as are vested in the [[British parliament]]. The sole authority for the powers of the [[United States Congress|federal congress]] is a written constitution with defined powers. Anything done in excess of those powers is null and void. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]], on the other hand, declared that, by the constitution, a government is ordained and established &quot;for the United States of America&quot; and not for countries outside their limits (''Ross's Case'', 140 U.S. 453, 464), and that no such power to legislate for annexed territories as that vested in the British [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Crown in Council]] is enjoyed by the president of the United States (''Field'' v. ''Clark'', 143 U.S. 649, 692). Every detail connected with the administration of the territories acquired from [[Spain]] under the [[Treaty of Paris]] ([[December 10]], [[1898]]) gave rise to minute discussion. 

== Examples of annexation ==

=== Hawai'i ===

In 1898, [[Hawaii]] (having moved from a [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom]] to a [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic]] five years earlier in the overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani) was annexed into the United States.

=== Texas ===
{{main|Texas Annexation}}
In 1836, the people of [[Texas]] voted to request that the United States annex Texas.  Concerned with [[United States Constitution|the constitutionality]] of annexation and for fear of offending the controlling power, [[Mexico]], however, the [[Martin Van Buren|Van Buren Administration]] rejected the request, which was eventually withdrawn.  In 1843, the United States became concerned with [[United Kingdom|British]] designs on Texas.  A new president, [[John Tyler]], became a proponent of annexation.  Following acceptance of the terms of annexation by the people of Texas, the young nation became a part of the United States in 1846.

=== Ohio City ===
[[Ohio City (Cuyahoga County), Ohio|Ohio City]], a suburb and fierce rival of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] was peacefully annexed to the city on [[June 5]], [[1854]].

=== City of Atlanta ===
In 1909 the [[United States|U.S.]] city of [[Atlanta]], then located only in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], annexed into part of neighboring [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]] (from which Fulton County had originally been divided).  The situation continues to provide some problems, such as when police arrest suspects on charges set forth in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[U.S. state|state]] law, and city police must determine which county's jail they must be taken to.

=== Jerusalem ===
In the aftermath of the 1967 [[Six Day War]], in which [[Israel]] had occupied East [[Jerusalem]] as well as the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza]] and the [[Golan Heights]], Israel declared East and West Jerusalem one united city, incorporating the eastern part into one municipality, but soon after declaring to the UN that its measures were not annexation.  In 1980 Israel passed the Jerusalem law, which redeclared the unity of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but did not declare its borders.  Some consider the latter act annexation, but without explict declaration of sovereignty this is in doubt.  Israel's measures are not internationally recognized.

=== Golan ===
In 1981, Israel extended its &quot;laws, jurisdiction and administration&quot; to the [[Golan Heights]] (including the [[Shebaa Farms]]), which it captured from [[Syria]] in the 1967 [[Six Day War]].  This not entirely clear &quot;annexation&quot; declaration was declared &quot;null and void and without international legal effect&quot; by the [[United Nations]].

=== Kuwait ===
After being allied with [[Iraq]] during the [[Iran-Iraq War|Iran–Iraq War]] (largely due to desiring Iraqi protection from Islamic [[Iran]]), [[Kuwait]] was invaded and annexed by Iraq (under [[Saddam Hussein]]) in August 1990.  Hussein's primary justifications included a charge that Kuwaiti territory was in fact an Iraqi province, and that annexation was retaliation for &quot;economic warfare&quot; Kuwait had waged through [[slant drilling]] into Iraq's oil supplies.  The monarchy was deposed after annexation, and an Iraqi governor installed.

Though initially ambiguous toward a potential annexation of Kuwait by Iraq,{{fact}} US President [[George H. W. Bush]] ultimately condemned Hussein's actions, and moved to drive out Iraqi forces.  Authorized by the [[UN Security Council]], an [[United States|American]]-led coalition of 34 nations fought the [[Persian Gulf War]] to reinstate the Kuwaiti [[Emir]]. Hussein's invasion (and annexation) was deemed illegal and Kuwait remains an independent nation today.

=== Western Sahara ===

In 1975, [[Morocco]] invaded the former [[Spain|Spanish]] colony of [[Western Sahara]] and proclaimed it part of the kingdom. This has never been recognized internationally, and a nationalist movement, the [[Polisario Front]], representing the evicted [[Sahrawi]] native population, persists in claiming the area for an exiled [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|Sahrawi republic]]. A [[United Nations]] peace process was initiated in 1991, but it has been stalled, and the resumption of hostilities remain a possibility.

=== Wales ===
[[Wales]] was annexed to the legal system of [[England]] by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542|Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]] to create a single jurisdiction, but references in legislation for 'England' were still taken as excluding Wales.  The [[Wales and Berwick Act 1746]] meant that in all future laws, 'England' would by default include Wales (and [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]]).  In 1967 the Wales and Berwick Act insofar as it applied to Wales was repealed. For many administrative and judicial purposes they are still treated as the single entity [[England and Wales]].

=== Korea ===
On [[August 22]], [[1910]], [[Korea]] was officially annexed by [[Japan]] with the [[Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty|Korea–Japan Annexation Treaty]] signed by [[Lee Wan-Yong]], [[Prime Minister of Korea]], and [[Masatake Terauchi]], Japanese Resident-General in Korea who became the [[Governor-General of Korea]]. Korea continued to be ruled by [[Japan]] until Japan's surrender to the Allied Forces on [[15 August]] [[1945]]. See [[Korea under Japanese rule]] for further information.

===Austria===
On [[March 12]], [[1938]], [[Nazi Germany]] annexed [[Austria]] in the ''[[Anschluss]]''. Austria's annexation marked the first major steps in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s long-desired expansion of Germany.  The country was liberated from Nazi power at the end of [[World War II]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]].

===Ethiopia===
On [[May 9]], [[1936]], [[Ethiopia]] was annexed by [[Italy]], only to be liberated during the Allied [[East African Campaign]].

[[Image:Ashoka2.jpg|thumb|200px|Emperor Ashoka (a possible picturisation)]]
'''Ashoka the Great''' ([[Devanagari language|Devanagari]]: &amp;#2309;&amp;#2358;&amp;#2379;&amp;#2325;; [[IAST|IAST transliteration]]: ''{{IAST|Aşoka}}'') was the emperor of the [[Mauryan Empire]] from [[273 BCE]] to [[232 BCE]]. After a number of military conquests, Ashoka reigned over most of [[South Asia]] and beyond, from present-day [[Afghanistan]] to [[Bengal]] and as far south as [[Mysore]]. An early supporter of [[Buddhism]], Ashoka established monuments marking several significant sites in the life of [[Shakyamuni Buddha]], and according to Buddhist tradition was closely involved in the preservation and transmission of Buddhism. In his edicts he is reffered to as &quot;Devaanaampriya&quot; or &quot;The Beloved Of The Gods&quot;

The name &quot;Ashoka&quot; means &quot;without sorrow&quot; in [[Sanskrit]]. Ashoka was the first ruler of ancient [[Bharatavarsha]] ([[India]]), after the famed [[Mahabharata]] rulers, to unify such a vast territory under his empire, which in retrospect exceeds the boundaries of the present-day [[Republic of India]].

The [[British literature|British author]] [[H.G. Wells]] wrote of Ashoka: ''&quot;In the history of the world there have been thousands of kings and emperors who called themselves 'their highnesses,' 'their majesties,' and 'their exalted majesties' and so on. They shone for a brief moment, and as quickly disappeared. But Ashoka shines and shines brightly like a bright star, even unto this day.&quot;''


==Historical sources==
Information about the life and reign of Ashoka primarily comes from a relatively small number of Buddhist sources.  In particular, the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Avadana|Ashoka Avadana]]'' ('Story of Ashoka') and the two [[Pāli]] chronicles of [[Sri Lanka]] (the [[Dipavamsa]] and [[Mahavamsa]]) provide most of the currently known information about Asoka.  Additional information is contributed by the [[Edicts of Asoka]], whose authorship was finally attributed to the Ashoka of Buddhist legend after the discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts ('''Priyadarsi'''- meaning 'good looking', or 'favored by the Gods') as a title or additional name of Ashoka Mauriya.

The use of Buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of Ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of Ashoka, and the interpretations of his edicts.  Building on traditional accounts, early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution.

Later scholars have tended to question this assessment.  The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources- the Ashokan edicts- make only a few references to Buddhism directly, despite many references to the concept of [[dharma]] (Sanskrit: [[dharma]]).  Some interpreters have seen this as an indication that Ashoka was attempting to craft an inclusive, poly-religious civil religion for his empire that was centered on the concept of ''dharma'' as a positive moral force, but which did not embrace or advocate any particular philosophy attributable to the religious movements of Ashoka's age (such as the [[Jain]]s, Buddhists, orthodox [[Brahmanism|Brahmanists]], and [[Ajivika]]s).  

Most likely, the complex religious environment of the age would have required careful diplomatic management in order to avoid provoking religious unrest.  Modern scholars and adherants of the traditional Buddhist perspective both tend to agree that Ashoka's rule was marked by tolerance towards a number of religious faiths.

==Early life==      
Ashoka was the son of the [[Maurya|Mauryan]] emperor [[Bindusara]] by a relatively lower ranked Queen known as Dharma. Dharma, it is said was the daughter of a poor Brahmin, who was introduced into the harem by her father as it was predicted that her son would be a great king. Understandably, her status in the harem was very low. Ashoka had several elder half-brothers and just one younger sibling, Vitthashoka, another son of Dharma.
The Buddhist sources also indicate that he was quite ugly.

==Rise to power==
Developing into an impeccable warrior general and a shrewd statesman, Ashoka went on to command several [[regiment]]s of the Mauryan army. His growing popularity across the empire made his elder brothers wary of his chances of being favoured by [[Bindusara]] to become the next emperor. The eldest of them, Prince [[Susima]], the traditional heir to the throne, persuaded Bindusara to send Ashoka to quell an uprising in the city of [[Takshashila]] in the north-west province of [[Sindh]], of which Prince Susima was the governor. Takshashila was a highly volatile place because of the war-like [[Indo-Greek]] population and mismanagement by Susima himself. This had led to the formation of different [[militia]]s causing unrest. Ashoka complied and left for the troubled area. As news of Ashoka's visit with his army trickled in, he was welcomed by the revolting militias and the uprising ended without a fight. (The province revolted once more during the rule of Ashoka, but this time the uprising was crushed with an iron fist). 

Ashoka's success made his half-brothers more wary of his intentions of becoming the emperor, and more incitements from Susima led Bindusara to send Ashoka into exile. He went into [[Orissa|Kalinga]] and stayed incognito there. There he met a fisherwoman named [[Kaurwaki]], with whom he fell in love; recently found inscriptions indicate that she went on to become his second or third queen.

Meanwhile, there was again a violent uprising in [[Ujjain]]. Emperor Bindusara summoned Ashoka back after an exile of two years. Ashoka went into Ujjain and in the ensuing battle was injured, but his generals quelled the uprising. Ashoka was treated in hiding so that loyalists of the Susima group could not harm him. He was treated by Buddhist monks and nuns. This is where he first learned the teachings of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and it is also where he met Devi, who was his personal nurse and the daughter of a merchant from adjacent [[Vidisha]]. After recovering, he married her. Ashoka, at this time, was already married to Asandhimitra who was to be his much loved chief queen for many years till her death. She seems to have stayed on in Patliputra all her life.

The following year passed quite peacefully for him and Devi was about to deliver his first child. In the meantime, Emperor Bindusara took ill and was on his death bed. A clique of ministers lead by Radhagupta, who hated Susima, summoned Ashoka to take the crown, though Bindusara preferred Susima. As the Buddhist lore goes, in a fit of rage, Prince Ashoka attacked [[Pataliputra]] (modern day [[Patna]]), and killed all his brothers, including Susima, and threw their bodies in a well in Pataliputra. It is not known if Bindusara was already dead at this time. At that stage of his life, many called him '''Chanda Ashoka''' meaning murderer and heartless Ashoka.The Buddhist legends paint a gory picture of his sadistic activities at this time. Most are incredible, and must be read as supporting background to highlight the transformation Buddhism brought about later.

Ascending the throne, Ashoka expanded his empire over the next eight years, expanding it from the present-day boundaries of [[Bangladesh]] and the state of [[Assam]] in India in the east to the territory of present-day [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] in the west; from the [[Pamir Knots]] in the north to the almost peninsular part of [[southern India]]. At that stage of his life, he was called '''Chakravarti''' which literally translates to &quot;he for whom the wheel of law turns&quot; (broadly meaning the emperor).

====Conquest of Kalinga====
[[Image:ashokan_empire.gif|right|thumb|250px|After the battle of Kalinga, Ashoka ruled most of the Indian subcontinent]]
While the early part of Ashoka's reign was apparently quite bloodthirsty, he became a follower of the Buddha's teaching after his conquest of Kalinga, on the east coast of India in the present-day state of [[Orissa]]. Kalinga was a state that prided itself on its [[sovereignty]] and [[democracy]]; with its monarchical-cum-parliamentary democracy, it was quite an exception in ancient Bharata, as there existed the concept of [[Rajdharma]], meaning the duty of the rulers, which was intrinsically entwined with the concept of bravery and [[Kshatriya dharma]].

The pretext for the start of the [[Kalinga War]] ([[265 BC]] or [[263 BC]]) is uncertain. One of Susima's brothers might have fled to Kalinga and found official refuge there. This enraged Ashoka immensely. He was advised by his ministers to attack Kalinga for this act of treachery. Ashoka then asked Kalinga's royalty to submit before his supremacy. When they defied this ''[[diktat]]'', Ashoka sent one of his generals to Kalinga to make them submit.

The general and his forces were, however, completely routed through the skilled tactics of Kalinga's commander-in-chief. Ashoka, baffled at this defeat, attacked with the greatest invasion ever recorded in Indian history until then. Kalinga put up a stiff resistance, but they were no match for Ashoka's brutal strength. The whole of Kalinga was plundered and destroyed: Ashoka's later edicts say that about 100,000 people were killed on the Kalinga side and 10,000 from Ashoka's army; thousands of men and women were deported.

==Embrace of Buddhism==
As the legend goes, one day after the war was over, Ashoka ventured out to roam the city and all he could see were burnt houses and scattered corpses. This sight made him sick and he cried the famous quotation, &quot;What have I done?&quot; The brutality of the conquest led him to adopt [[Buddhism]] and he used his position to propagate the relatively new philosophy to new heights, as far as ancient [[Rome]] and [[Egypt]]. From that point Ashoka, who had been described as &quot;the cruel Ashoka&quot; (''Chandashoka''), started to be described as &quot;the pious Ashoka&quot; (''Dharmashoka''). He propagated the Vibhajjvada school of Buddhism and preached it within his domain and worldwide from about [[250 BC]]. Emperor Ashoka undoubtedly has to be credited with the first serious attempt to develop a Buddhist [[polity]]. 

[[Image:MauryanCoin.JPG|thumb|300px|Silver punch-mark coins of the '''Mauryan empire''', bear Buddhist symbols such as the [[dharma wheel]], the elephant (previous form of the Buddha), the tree under which enlightenment happened, and the burial mound where the Buddha died (obverse). [[3rd century BC]].]]

Prominent in this cause were his son Venerable [[Mahindra]] and daughter [[Sanghamitra]] (whose name means &quot;friend of the [[Sangha]]&quot;), who established Buddhism in [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]). He built thousands of [[stupa]]s and [[Vihara]]s for Buddhist followers. The Stupas of [[Sanchi]] are world famous and the stupa named Sanchi Stupa 1 was built by Emperor Ashoka. During the remaining portion of Ashoka's reign, he pursued an official policy of [[nonviolence]] or [[ahimsa]]. Even the unnecessary slaughter or mutilation of animals was immediately abolished. [[Wildlife]] became protected by the king's law against [[sport]] [[hunting]] and [[branding]]. Limited hunting was permitted for consumption reasons but Ashoka also promoted the concept of [[vegetarianism]]. Ashoka also showed mercy to those imprisoned, allowing them outside one day each year. He attempted to raise the professional ambition of the common man by building [[university|universities]] for study and water transit and [[irrigation]] systems for [[trade]] and [[agriculture]]. He treated his subjects as equals regardless of their religion, politics and [[caste]]. The kingdoms surrounding his, so easily overthrown, were instead made to be well-respected allies.

He is acclaimed for constructing [[hospital]]s for animals and renovating major roads throughout [[India]]. Dharmashoka defined the main principles of ''dharma'' (''dharma'' in [[Pāli]]) as nonviolence, [[tolerance]] of all [[sect]]s and opinions, [[obedience]] to parents, [[respect]] for the [[Brahman]]s and other religious teachers and [[priest]]s, [[liberal]] towards friends, humane treatment of [[servant (domestic)|servant]]s, and [[generosity]] towards all. These principles suggest a general ethic of behavior to which no religious or social group could object.

[[Image:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Bilingual edict ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) by king Ashoka, from [[Kandahar]]. [[Kabul]] Museum.]]
Some critics say that Ashoka was afraid of more wars, but among his neighbors, including the [[Seleucid Empire]] and the [[Greco-Bactrian]] kingdom established by [[Diodotus I]], none could match his strength. He was a contemporary of both [[Antiochus I Soter]] and his successor [[Antiochus II Theos]] of the [[Seleucid dynasty]] as well as Diodotus I and his son [[Diodotus II]] of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. If his [[inscription]]s and [[edict]]s are well studied, one finds that he was familiar with the [[Hellenic world]] but never in awe of it. The [[Edicts of Ashoka]], which talk of friendly relations, give the names of both Antiochus of the Seleucid empire and [[Ptolemy III]] of [[Egypt]]. But the fame of the Mauryan empire was widespread from the time that Ashoka's grandfather [[Chandragupta Maurya]] defeated [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus Nicator]], the founder of the [[Seleucid Dynasty]].

The [[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashoka Pillar]] at [[Sarnath]] is the most popular of the relics left by Ashoka. Made of [[sandstone]], this pillar records the visit of the emperor to Sarnath, in the [[3rd century BC]]. It has a [[Lion Capital of Asoka|four-lion capital]] (four lions standing back to back) which was adopted as the [[National emblem|emblem]] of the modern Indian republic. The lion symbolises both Ashoka's imperial rule and the kingship of the Buddha. In translating these monuments, historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the Mauryan Empire. It is difficult to determine whether certain events ever happened, but the stone etchings depict clearly of how Ashoka wanted to be thought and how he wanted to be remembered.

Ashoka's own words as known from his Edicts are: &quot;All men are my children. I am like a father to them. As every father desires the good and the happiness of his children, I wish that all men should be happy always.&quot; Edward D'Cruz interprets the Ashokan ''dharma'' as a &quot;religion to be used as a symbol of a new imperial unity and a cementing force to weld the diverse and heterogeneous elements of the empire&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
[[Image:Asoka1.gif|thumb|right|200px|Ashoka's first rock inscription at [[Girnar]]]]
Emperor Ashoka ruled for an estimated forty years, and after his death, the Maurya dynasty lasted just fifty more years. Ashoka had many wives and children, but their names are lost to time. [[Mahindra]] and [[Sanghamitra]] were twins born by his fourth wife, [[Devi]], in the city of [[Ujjain]]. He had entrusted to them the job of making his state religion, Buddhism, more popular across the known and the unknown world. [[Mahindra]] and [[Sanghamitra]] went into [[Sri Lanka]] and converted the King, the Queen and their people to Buddhism. So they were naturally not the ones handling state affairs after him.
In his old age, he seems to have come under the spell of his youngest wife Tishyarakshita. It is said that she had got his son Kunala, the regent in Takshashila, blinded by a wily stratagem. When Ashoka discovered this he had Kunala's son Samprati declared the successor. But his rule did not last long after Ashoka's death.

[[Image:AshokaCapital.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The [[Emblem of India]] is a replica of [[Ashoka Pillar]]]]

The reign of Emperor Ashoka Maurya could easily have disappeared into history as the ages passed by, and would have, if he had not left behind a record of his trials. The testimony of this wise king was discovered in the form of magnificently sculpted pillars and boulders with a variety of actions and teachings he wished to be published etched into the stone. What Ashoka left behind was the first written language in India since the ancient city of [[Harappa]]. Rather than Sanskrit, the language used for inscription was the current spoken form called [[Prakrit]].

In the year [[185 BC]], about fifty years after Ashoka's death, the last Mauryan ruler, [[Brhadrata]], was brutally murdered by the commander-in-chief of the Mauryan armed forces, [[Pusyamitra Sunga]], while he was taking the Guard of Honor of his forces. Pusyamitra Sunga founded the [[Sunga dynasty]] ([[185 BC]]-[[78 BC]]) and ruled just a fragmented part of the Mauryan Empire.

Not until some 2,000 years later under [[Akbar|Akbar the Great]] and his great-grandson [[Aurangzeb]] would as large a portion of the [[subcontinent]] as that ruled by Ashoka again be united under a single ruler. When India gained independence from the [[British Empire]] it adopted Ashoka's emblem for its own, placing the [[dharma wheel]](The Wheel of Rightious Duty) that crowned his many columns on the [[Flag of India|flag]] of the newly independent state.

Ashoka was ranked #53 on [[Michael H. Hart]]'s [[The 100|list of the most influential figures in history]].

A semi-fictionalized portrayal of Ashoka's life was produced as a motion picture recently under the title [[Asoka (film)|Asoka]].

===Ashoka and Buddhist Kingship===
One of the more enduring legacies of Ashoka Maurya was the model that he provided for the relationship between Buddhism and the state.  Throughout Theravada Southeast Asia, the model of rulership embodied by Ashoka replaced the Brahmanist notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated (in the [[Angkor]] kingdom, for instance).  Under this model of 'Buddhist kingship', the king sought to legitimize his rule not through descent from a divine source, but by supporting and earning the approval of the Buddhist ''[[sangha]]''.  Following Ashoka's example, kings established monasteries, funded the construction of stupas, and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom.  Many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha, as Ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious issues during his reign.  This development ultimately lead to a close association in many Southeast Asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy, an association that can still be seen today in the state-supported [[Buddhism in Thailand|Buddhism of Thailand]] and the traditional role of the Thai king as both a religious and secular leader.

Ashoka also said that all his courtiers were true to their self and governed the people in a moral manner

==Ashoka in popular culture==

* ''[[Asoka (film)|Asoka]]'' is a [[film]] based on his life.
* ''Asoka ki chinta'' is a famous hindi poem by [[Jaishankar Prasad]]. The poem portrays Asoka's mindset during [[Kalinga War]].
* In some [[conspiracy theories]] Ashoka is mentioned as the founder of a powerful secret society called the [[Nine Unknown Men]].
* Ashoka is a character in the turn-based strategy game [[Civilization 4]].

The '''Archaea''' ({{IPA2|ɑːˌkiːə}}), also called '''Archaebacteria''' ({{IPA2|ˈɑːkɪbakˌtɪərɪə}}), are a major division of [[life|living]] [[organism]]s.  Although there is still uncertainty in the exact [[phylogeny]] of the groups, Archaea, [[Eukaryote]]s and [[Bacteria]] are the fundamental classifications in what is called the [[three-domain system]].  Archaea are, like bacteria, single-cell organisms lacking [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] and are therefore classified as [[prokaryote]]s &amp;mdash; known as [[Monera]] in the five-[[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[Linnaean taxonomy | taxonomy]].  They were originally described in [[extremophile | extreme]] environments, but have since been found in all types of [[habitat]]s. 

== History ==
Archaea were identified in [[1977]] by [[Carl Woese]] and George Fox based on their separation from other prokaryotes on 16S [[rRNA]] [[phylogenetic tree]]s.  These two groups were originally named the Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, treated as [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]s or subkingdoms.  Woese argued that they represented fundamentally different branches of living things.  He later renamed the groups Archaea and [[Bacteria]] to emphasize this, and argued that together with [[Eukarya]] they comprise [[three-domain system|three domains]] of living things.

== Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryotes==
Archaea are similar to other prokaryotes in most aspects of [[Cell (biology)|cell]] structure and [[metabolism]].  However, their genetic [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (genetics)|translation]] &amp;mdash; the two central processes in [[molecular biology]] &amp;mdash; do not show the typical bacterial features, but are extremely similar to those of [[eukaryote]]s.  For instance, archaean translation uses eukaryotic initiation and elongation factors, and their transcription involves TATA-binding proteins and TFIIB as in eukaryotes.

Several other characteristics also set the Archaea apart.  Like bacteria and eukaryotes, archaea possess [[glycerol]] based [[phospholipids]].  However, three features of the archaeal lipids are unusual:

*The archaeal lipids are unique because the stereochemistry of the glycerol is the reverse of that found in bacteria and eukaryotes.  This is strong evidence for a different biosynthetic pathway.

*Most bacteria and eukaryotes have membranes composed mainly of glycerol-[[ester]] [[lipid]]s, whereas archaea have membranes composed of glycerol-''[[ether]]'' lipids.  Even when bacteria have ether-linked lipids, the stereochemistry of the glycerol is the bacterial form.  This differences may be an adaptation on the part of Archaea to [[hyperthermophile|hyperthermophily]].  However, it is worth noting that even mesophilic archaea have ether-linked lipids.

*Archaeal lipids are based upon the [[isoprene|isoprenoid]] sidechain.  This is a five-carbon unit that is also common in rubber and as a component of some vitamins common in bacteria and eukaryotes.  However, only the archaea incorporate these compounds into their cellular lipids, frequently as C-20 (four monomers) or C-40 (eight monomers) sidechains.  In some archaea, the C-40 isoprenoid side-chain is actually long enough to span the membrane, forming a monolayer for a [[cell membrane]] with glycerol phosphate moieties on both ends.  

Although dramatic, this adaptation is most common in the extremely thermophilic archaea. Although not unique, the archaeal cell walls are also unusual.  For instance, the cell walls of most archaea are formed by surface layer proteins or an S-layer.  S-layers are common in bacteria, where they serve as the sole cell wall component in some organisms (like the Planctomyces) or an outer layer in many organisms with peptidoglycan.  With the exception of one group of methanogens, archaea lack a [[peptidoglycan]] wall. Even in this case, the peptidoglycan is very different from the type found in bacteria.  Archaeans also have [[flagellum|flagella]] that are notably different in composition and development from the superficially similar flagella of bacteria.

[[image:PhylogeneticTree.jpg|thumb|left|320px|A phylogenetic tree based on [[rRNA]] data, showing the separation of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.]]

==Habitats==
Many archaeans are [[extremophile]]s.  Some live at very high temperatures, often above 100&amp;deg;C, as found in [[geyser]]s and [[black smoker]]s.  Others are found in very cold habitats or in highly-[[salt|saline]], [[acid]]ic, or [[alkaline]] water.  However, other archaeans are [[mesophile]]s, and have been found in environments like [[marsh]]land, [[sewage]], and [[soil]].  Many [[methanogen]]ic archaea are found in the digestive tracts of animals such as [[ruminant]]s, [[termite]]s, and humans.  Archaea are usually harmless to other organisms and none are known to cause disease.

==Form==
Individual archaeans range from 0.1 &amp;mu;m to over 15 &amp;mu;m in diameter, and some form aggregates or filaments up to 200 &amp;mu;m in length.  They occur in various shapes, such as spherical, rod-shape, spiral, lobed, or rectangular.  They also exhibit a variety of different types of metabolism.  Of note, the [[halobacteria]] can use light to produce [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], although no Archaea conduct [[photosynthesis]] with an electron transport chain, as occurs in other groups.

==Evolution and classification==

Archaea are divided into two main groups based on rRNA trees, the [[Euryarchaeota]] and [[Crenarchaeota]].  Two other groups have been tentatively created for certain environmental samples and the peculiar species ''[[Nanoarchaeum|Nanoarchaeum equitans]]'', discovered in 2002 by [[Karl Stetter]], but their affinities are uncertain.

Woese argued that the bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes each represent a primary line of descent that diverged early on from an ancestral ''[[progenote]]'' with poorly-developed genetic machinery.  This hypothesis is reflected in the name Archaea, from the Greek ''archae'' or ancient.  Later he treated these groups formally as [[three-domain system|domain]]s, each comprising several kingdoms.  This division has become very popular, although the idea of the progenote itself is not generally supported.  Some biologists, however, have argued that the archaebacteria and eukaryotes arose from specialized eubacteria.

The relationship between Archaea and Eukarya remains an important problem.  Aside from the similarities noted above, many genetic trees group the two together.  Some place eukaryotes closer to Eurarchaeota than Crenarchaeota are, although the membrane chemistry suggests otherwise.  However, the discovery of archaean-like genes in certain [[bacterium|bacteria]], such as ''Thermotoga'', makes their relationship difficult to determine.  Some have suggested that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and eubacterium, which became the nucleus and cytoplasm, which accounts for various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure.

Single gene [[sequencing]] for [[systematics]] has led to whole [[genome sequencing]]; currently 24 archaeal genomes have been completed with 22 partially completed [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi].

'''''American''''', when used as an adjective, most frequently is used to mean &quot;of the [[United States|United States of America]]&quot; in the English language. Less frequently, in a United States context, it means &quot;of or relating to [[the Americas]].&quot;  When used as a noun, it most frequently is used to mean &quot;United States [[citizen]].&quot; Less frequently, &quot;residing in the Americas,&quot; or &quot;[[American English]].&quot;

==''American'' in the Americas==
The word [[The Americas|America]] was [[The Americas#Naming of America|derived]] by [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] cartographer [[Martin Waldseemüller]] from the Latinized version of the name of [[Amerigo Vespucci]] (''Americus Vespucius''), an [[Italy|Italian]] merchant and cartographer whose exploratory journeys in the late 1400s and early 1500s brought him to the eastern coastline of [[South America]] and to the [[Caribbean]]. The term ''American'' was subsequently used as an adjective describing the [[New World]] and its native people.

Starting by 1700 the word &quot;American&quot; was used by Europeans for the Indians in the New World. In 1765 came the first use to describe the British colonists.  That usage was widespread by 1774, and in 1776 the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] proclaimed a new country, &quot;The United States of America.&quot;  At that time &quot;America&quot; was also used to designate continents in atlases published in Europe, but very few people ever saw those books. The [[American Revolution]] was closely followed in Europe, and the term became common for the inhabitants of the new nation.  Since 1776, the term ''American'' has gained universal usage in reference to residents of the [[United States of America]]. Controversy has arisen over whether this usage is appropriate, or whether the term should only be used as an adjective covering the whole of [[North America]] and [[South America]]. Geographers disagree among themselves: English language atlases display two continents, &quot;North America&quot; and &quot;South America&quot; while Spanish language atlases display one continent, &quot;America.&quot; 

Proponents of the usage of ''American'' as a lexical attachment to 'America' broadly defined as the continent/s of North and South America argue that current usage is at best inaccurate, historically incorrect and at worst redolent of perceived US [[imperialism]]. They add that the main purpose of clear language is to avoid ambiguity. 

Proponents of the usage of ''American'' to refer to the United States argue that the USA is the only sovereign nation in the world with the word ''America'' in its official name. Additionally, other nations, including Mexico presently and Brazil in the past, have or have had the term &quot;United States&quot; in their official names. Thus, to many, referring to U.S. citizens as ''Americans'' is convenient and legitimate, while using ''U.S.'' could in fact be ambiguous. Also, there is tradition to consider as the term has been applied to residents of the U.S. from the very beginning of that country.

Critics opposed to the change say that [[essentialism]] regarding words is an error.  Lexicographers tell how people use the word; they do not issue edicts that say &quot;America&quot; can only refer to geographical continents rather than a country.  Every major dictionary makes clear that &quot;American&quot; applied to residents of the U.S. is standard usage, and has been for over 200 years in every Anglophone country.

In [[Canada]], the term &quot;American&quot; is widely understood to refer exclusively to citizens of the U.S., and Canadians do not refer to themselves as Americans.  On the other hand, in [[Spain]], people who have lived in the Western Hemisphere but now live in Spain may be called, in Spanish, ''americanos'' (translated into English as &quot;Americans&quot;). 

In discussions of geography, one might specify North America, Central America, or South America when the reference is to a continent or region.  Residents of the Western Hemisphere rarely call themselves &quot;North American&quot; or &quot;South American&quot;; the term &quot;Central American&quot; is more common.  Many alternative [[neologism]]s to ''American'' have been proposed to refer to the United States of America, but they have failed to garner widespread acceptance.   

This has given rise to terms like &quot;[[Mexican-American]]&quot; or &quot;Canadian-American&quot; to refer to people of Mexican or Canadian origin living in the United States—either as first-generation immigrants or their descendants. These terms are never used to refer to natives of Mexico or Canada. Geo-politically speaking, such terms are redundant.

[[Canadian identity|Canadians]] in particular have devoted a great deal of attention to proclaiming that they are not-Americans -meaning US citizens-, both in their own cultural products and when they travel outside the region and are frequently mistaken as coming from the United States.

===American in the US Census===
[[Image:American1346.gif|thumb|&quot;American&quot; ancestry in US counties.]]

In the United States census, millions of people describe their (main) [[ethnic origin]] as &quot;American&quot;, particularly those belonging in southern states. This region has a high percentage of people who trace their descent to the colonial origins of the United States and often lack records of the particular, but generally, British countries of their ancestor's origins.

==''American'' in cultural usages==
'''American''', culturally, generally refers to things which originated within the United States of America.

Some foods, such as hamburgers, are seen as [[American cuisine]].

Some sports, such as [[baseball]] or [[American football]], are seen as American, even though they may be played in other countries.

Some music, such as [[jazz]], [[country music]], or [[American folk music]] are seen as American, even though they may be popular in other countries.

==''American'' in other languages==
[[English language|English]] speakers commonly use ''American'' to refer to the United States only. In the [[United Kingdom]], the use of 'US' as an adjective is preferred where it can be comfortably used, and is prevalent in media and government house-styles.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''americano'' tends to refer to any resident of the Americas and not from the United States; English spoken in Latin America often makes this distinction as well.  

''US-American'' is another option, and is the dominant demonym in German (''US-Amerikaner'').  Latin Americans also have the [[euphemism]] ''norteamericano'' (''North American'', which itself conflates the USA and Canada and possibly Mexico).  

''United Statian'' is awkward in English, but it exists in Spanish (''estadounidense'') and occasionally in German (''Vereinigten Staatler''), and in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (both in [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]]), where the term ''estadunidense'' is growing and it is considered more appropriate than the common term ''norte-americano''.

The word [[Gringo]] is widely used in all of [[Latin America]], particularly in Mexico, to make a reference to U.S. residents, not necessarily in a pejorative way. ''Yanqui'' (''[[Yankee]]'') is also very common in some regions.

There have been a number of attempts to [[neologism|coin]] an alternative to &quot;[[American (disambiguation)|American]]&quot; as an adjective (a [[demonym]]) for a citizen of the [[United States]], that would not simultaneously mean a citizen of the Americas.

With the [[1994]] passage of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], the following words were used to label the ''United States Section'' of that organization: in [[Canadian French]], ''étatsunien''; in Spanish, ''estadounidense''.

==Seeking alternate names==
Many people use the word &quot;American&quot; to indicate any inhabitant of [[the Americas]] (which many people in other parts of the world tend to consider a single continent, called America) rather than specifically a citizen of the United States; and perceive the latter usage of &quot;American&quot; to be potentially ambiguous, and perhaps aggressive in tone or imperialistic, a rather widespread view in Latin America. 

However, many in the US assert that the word &quot;America&quot; in &quot;United States of America&quot; denotes the country's proper name, and is not a geographical indicator. They argue that the interpretation of ''United States '''of''' America'' to mean a country named ''United States'' located in the continent of ''America'' is mistaken. Instead, they argue that the preposition ''of'' is equivalent to the ''of'' in ''Federative Republic '''of''' Brazil'', ''Commonwealth '''of''' Australia'', ''Federal Republic '''of''' Germany''. That is, the ''of'' indicates the name of the state.  In addition, other countries use &quot;United&quot; or &quot;States&quot; in their names as well.  Indeed, the formal name of [[Mexico]] is ''Estados Unidos Mexicanos'', currently officially translated as &quot;United Mexican States&quot; had in the past been translated as &quot;United States of Mexico.&quot;

Regardless, many question a nation's right to formally appropriate the name of a continent for itself, citing the fact that America existed long before the United States ''of'' America. Indeed, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] (who travelled extensively throughout the Caribbean basin) never set foot on present US territory.

Some U.S. citizens and Latin Americans alike have no problem with the simultaneous usage of &quot;American&quot; as an adjective for all inhabitants of the Americas, and make the distinction between the demonym for a country and the demonym for a continent (or continents). They argue that there is no reason the two cannot share the term if it is used in distinct but equally legitimate contexts.

In other cases, the motivation is not so much political as it is academic, to avoid a perceived ambiguity. For instance, in legal circles a citizen of the United States is usually referred to as a 'U.S. citizen,' not an 'American citizen,' which could arguably apply to citizens of other American nation states as well.

A modern alternative term used by Latin speakers to reffer the people from the United Sates in their language is &quot;USen,&quot; situable short for &quot;United States Citizen.&quot;

==The alternatives==
Attempts to create such a name have failed to gain widespread use. Proposals have included:
*Americanite
*Appalacian (now only considered an accurate term for the people of [[Appalachia]])
*Colonican
*Columbard
*[[Historical Columbia|Columbia]]n (hence the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]])
*Frede or Fredonian 
*[[Nacirema]]
*Statesider
*Uesican (pronounced {{IPA|[juˈɛsɪkən]}}) or Uessian (pronounced {{IPA|[juˈɛsiən]}})
*Unisan or Unisian
*United States American, United Stater, United Stateser, United Statian, United Statesian, or United Statesman
*USAian, U.S. American, Usan, USAn, Usanian, Usian (pronounced {{IPA|[ˈjuʒən]}}), U-S-ian, or [[Usonia]]n (pronounced {{IPA|[juˈsoʊniən]}})
*USen
*Vespuccino
*Washingtonian.

References to these words have been around since the early days of the republic, but ''American'' has become by far the most common term. ''[[Usonia]]n'' is used in architectural circles, and ''Washingtonian'' remains as the adjective for the state of [[Washington]] and the city of [[Washington, D.C.]].

Several of these terms have direct parallels in languages other than [[English language|English]]. Many languages have already created their own distinct word for a citizen of the United States:
*''United Statian'' directly parallels the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term ''estadounidense''.
*''Norteamericano'' (North American) is common in [[Latin America]], but suffers from the same kind of ambiguity as ''American'', since Canadians and Mexicans, amongst others, are also North Americans.
* In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''norte-americano'' is the most commonly used term. ''Estadunidense'' is gaining some popularity, specifically in [[Brazil]], where its usage traditionally rises during times of tension with the USA.
*''Amerikan'' is a derogatory spelling, after the Eastern European spelling made popular in the West by Franz Kafka's 1946 novel.
*''Usonian'', from [[Usonia]], a term [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] used to describe his vision for American [[architecture]], homes, and cities, and used by [[John Dos Passos]] in his [[U.S.A. trilogy]].
* The [[Esperanto]] term for the [[United States|United States of America]] is ''Usono''.  This is generally thought to come from &quot;[[Usonia]].&quot;  In Esperanto, one forms the word for a citizen of a given country using the suffix &quot;-an&quot; which means &quot;member of.&quot; Therefore a citizen of the United States is ''usonano''.  (Such derived words are not capitalized.)  Esperanto terms for the American geographic regions and their people are ''Ameriko/amerikano'', ''Norda Ameriko/nordamerikano'', ''Meza Ameriko/mezamerikano'', and ''Suda Ameriko/sudamerikano''.
*''Usanian'' is derived from the [[Ido]] word ''Usana''.
*''[[Yankee]]'', often shortened to ''Yank'', is used all over the world in an informal manner similar to the use of the Mexican word ''[[Gringo]]''. Both terms may occasionally be used in an affectionate or pejorative sense. On occasion some U.S. citizens will take offense at the term ''Yankee'', particularly Southerners (residents of the [[Southeastern United States]]), who use ''Yankee'' to refer to Northerners (residents of the [[Northeastern United States]]), sometimes in a derogatory way. (Some people from [[Scotland]] or [[Wales]] may use ''Yankee'' as a deliberate riposte to people from the US who refer to them as English, from the enduring misconception that [[England]] is coterminous with the [[United Kingdom]].) 
**The colloquial term ''Yank'' for a U.S citizen, used in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Australia]], is a derivative of ''Yankee''. In Australia, the [[Cockney]] [[Cockney rhyming slang|rhyming slang]] term ''Sepo'' survives, derived from ''septic tank''.
* In [[French language|French]], ''États-Unien(ne)'', ''Étatsunien(ne)'', or ''Étasunien(ne)'' are gaining some popularity.
* In [[Italian language|Italian]] the term ''Statunitense'' (from 'Stati Uniti' = 'United States') is quite widespread, especially referring to sporting events.
* In [[German language|German]], ''US-Amerikaner'' may be used to avoid ambiguity or to be [[politically correct]], but it may come across as pedantic if used conversationally. ''Amerikaner'' is in general usage in German, and is widely accepted to refer to the United States. ''Ami'' is a colloquialism which unambiguously refers to US citizens. The German usage of ''Ami'' is akin to the Mexican usage of ''[[Gringo]]'', in that it can be neutral, patronizing, or perhaps even affectionate.
* In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] the term ''Bandaríkjamenn'' is quite widespread, Bandaríkin (United States) and menn for (people/persons)

==Less serious alternatives==
Less serious terms that have been popular on the Internet at various times include
*Leftpondian - from the fact that the USA is on the left side of the Atlantic Ocean (the &quot;pond&quot;) as seen on a map with north at the top.  This term is often used to include Canadians as well.
*Merkin - from the way some Americans pronounce the word &quot;American&quot;, but also playing on the word's [[merkin|other meaning]].

It addresses many of the same tasks as [[C programming language|C]] or [[C++]], but with one of the best [[Type safety|type-safety]] systems available in a [[statically typed]] programming language. Ada was named after [[Ada Lovelace]], often credited as the first computer programmer.

== Features ==

Ada was originally targeted at [[embedded system|embedded]] and [[real-time]] systems, and is still commonly used for those purposes. The Ada&amp;nbsp;95 revision, designed by [[Tucker Taft|S. Tucker Taft]] of [[Intermetrics]] between [[1992]] and [[1995]], improved support for systems, numerical, and financial programming.

Notable features of Ada include [[strongly typed languages|strong typing]], [[modularity (programming)|modularity mechanisms]] (packages), [[run-time checking]], [[parallel processing]] (tasks), [[exception handling]], and [[generic programming|generic]]s. Ada&amp;nbsp;95 added support for [[object-oriented programming]], including [[dynamic dispatch]].

Ada supports run-time checks in order to protect against access to unallocated memory, [[buffer overflow]] errors, [[off by one errors]], array access errors, and other avoidable bugs. These checks can be disabled in the interest of efficiency, but can often be compiled efficiently. It also includes facilities to help program verification. For these reasons, it is very widely used in critical systems like [[avionics]], weapons and spacecraft.

It also supports a large number of compile-time checks to help avoid bugs that would not be detectable until run-time in some other languages or would require explicit checks to be added to the source code.

Ada's dynamic [[memory management]] is safe and high-level, like Java and unlike C.  The specification does not require any particular implementation.  Though the semantics of the language allow automatic [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] of inaccessible objects, most implementations do not support it. Ada does support a limited form of [[region-based storage management]].  Invalid accesses can always be detected at run time (unless of course the check is turned off) and sometimes at compile time.

The Ada language definition is unusual among [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards in that it is [[free content]]. One result of this is that the standard document (known as the ''Ada Reference Manual'' or ''ARM'') is the usual reference Ada programmers resort to for technical details, in the same way as a particular standard textbook serves other programming languages.

== History ==

In the [[1970s]], the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] (DoD) was concerned by the number of different programming languages being used for its projects, many of which were obsolete or hardware-dependent, and none of which supported safe modular programming. In [[1975]] the [[Higher Order Language Working Group]] (HOLWG) was formed with the intent of reducing this number by finding or creating a programming language generally suitable for the department's requirements; the result was Ada. The total number of high-level programming languages in use for such projects fell from over 450 in [[1983]] to 37 by [[1996]].

{{Wikisource|Steelman language requirements}} The [[working group]] created a series of language requirements documents&amp;mdash;the Strawman, Woodenman, Tinman, Ironman and [[Steelman language requirements|Steelman]] documents. Many existing languages were formally reviewed, but the team concluded in [[1977]] that no existing language met the specifications.

Requests for proposals for a new programming language were issued and four contractors were hired to develop their proposals under the names of Red ([[Intermetrics]] led by [[Benjamin Brosgol]]), Green ([[CII Honeywell Bull]], led by [[Jean Ichbiah]]), Blue ([[SofTech]], led by [[John Goodenough]]), and Yellow ([[SRI International]], led by [[Jay Spitzen ]]).&lt;!-- Though Intermetrics and Bull have previous links, I am including them for parallelism. --&gt; In April 1978, after public scrutiny, the Red and Green proposals passed to the next phase. In May of [[1979]], the Green proposal, designed by Jean Ichbiah at CII Honeywell Bull, was chosen and given the name Ada&amp;mdash;after [[Ada Lovelace|Augusta Ada, Countess of Lovelace]]. This proposal was influenced by the programming language [[LIS programming language|LIS]] that Ichbiah and his group had developed in the [[1970s]]. The preliminary Ada reference manual
was published in ACM SIGPLAN Notices in June 1979. The Military Standard reference manual was approved on [[December 10]], [[1980]] ([[Ada Lovelace]]'s birthday), and
given the number MIL-STD-1815 in honor of Ada Lovelace's birth year.

[[Image:Ada Lovelace 1838.jpg|right|caption|thumbnail|157px|[[Ada Lovelace|Augusta Ada King]], Countess of Lovelace.]] 
In [[1987]], the US Department of Defense began to require the use of Ada (the ''Ada mandate'') for every software project where new code was more than 30% of result, though exceptions to this rule were often granted. This requirement was effectively removed in [[1997]], as the DoD began to embrace COTS ([[commercial off-the-shelf]]) technology. Similar requirements existed in other [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] countries.

Because Ada is a strongly-typed language, it has been used outside the military in commercial aviation projects, where a software bug can mean fatalities. The fly-by-wire system in the [[Boeing 777]] runs software written in Ada.

The language became an [[ANSI]] standard in [[1983]] ([http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/Welcome.html ANSI/MIL-STD 1815A], and 
without any further changes became
an [[International standard|ISO standard]] in [[1987]] (ISO-8652:1987). This version of the language is commonly known as Ada&amp;nbsp;83, from the date of its adoption by ANSI, but is sometimes referred to also as Ada&amp;nbsp;87, from the date of its adoption by ISO.

Ada&amp;nbsp;95, the joint ISO/ANSI standard ([http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-TTL.html ISO-8652:1995]) is the latest standard for Ada. It was published in February [[1995]] (making Ada&amp;nbsp;95 the first ISO standard object-oriented programming language). To help with the standard revision and future acceptance, the [[US Air Force]] funded the development of the [[GNAT]] [[Compiler]]. Nowadays the GNAT Compiler is part of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]].

Work continues on improving and updating the technical content of the Ada programming language. A Technical Corrigendum to Ada&amp;nbsp;95 was published in October [[2001]]. Presently, more work is being done to produce the roughly once-a-decade major update
to Ada, expected in [[2007]] (see [http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG9/projects.htm#AMD official schedule]). This new version is commonly known as Ada&amp;nbsp;2005, just as Ada&amp;nbsp;95 was commonly known as Ada&amp;nbsp;94 prior to its publication.

== &quot;Hello, world!&quot; in Ada ==
A common example of a language's [[syntax]] is the [[Hello world program]]:

 '''with''' Ada.Text_IO; 
 
 '''procedure''' Hello '''is'''
 '''begin'''
    Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
 '''end''' Hello;

There are shortcuts available for &lt;tt&gt;Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line&lt;/tt&gt;, needing less typing, however they are not used here for better understanding. For a detailed explanation see [[Wikibooks:Ada Programming/Basic]].

== The Ariane 5 failure ==
A commonly encountered myth blames the loss of [[Ariane 5 Flight 501]], a [[European Space Agency]] [[Ariane 5]] rocket, on a bug in an Ada program or on disabling Ada's runtime checks. For the [[Ariane 4]] it had been proven that those runtime checks weren't needed. Although range checks and appropriate exception handlers on all type conversions might have trapped the problem, the problem itself was a design decision to reuse a part and its software from the [[Ariane 4]] rocket without adequate analysis of its suitability or tests on [[Ariane 5]] data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alfonso Arau''' (born [[January 11]], [[1932]]) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] director of such films as ''[[Zapata: The Dream of a Hero]]'', ''[[Like Water for Chocolate]]'' (Mexico, 1992) (the novel of which was, somewhat [[Irony|ironically]], written by his wife, [[Laura Esquivel]]), and ''[[A Walk in the Clouds]]'', which starred [[Keanu Reeves]] and [[Anthony Quinn]].

He is also an actor. Among others, he had the antagonic role of &quot;El Guapo&quot; in ¡[[Three Amigos]]! (USA, 1986), a comedy with [[Martin Short]], [[Steve Martin]], and [[Chevy Chase]].  He also played Captain Herrera in [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s 1969 western, [[The Wild Bunch]].

In 1973 he acted and directed ''Calzónzin Inspector'', a movie based on a Mexican comic called ''Los Supermachos'', of great Mexican cartoonist [[Rius]], although Rius disapproved the movie. The movie is about two indigenous Mexicans who are confused for government inspectors from the capital by the corrupt mayor of a small town, and is an humorous political critique, aimed squarely at then ruling party [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]] and its [[cacique|caciques]], in a time when freedom of speech in regard to political matters was highly restricted. 
There are at least two versions of the movie, the shorter one having some scenes deleted, the most notable one shows the killing of a renegade farmer by a policeman shooting at his back.

A notable movie was ''El rincón de las vírgenes'' (Mexico, 1972), &quot;The Virgins' Corner&quot; where he plays the helper to a fake mystical doctor travelling town to town, remembering their travels when a group of women intend to propose the doctor for sainthood. The movie is set in the 1920's in rural Mexico.

In December 2004 the Santa Fe Film Festival bestowed its Luminaria Award for lifetime achievement in cinema to Alfonso Arau as a cornerstone to its five-day festival.  Jon Bowman, executive director of the Santa Fe Film Festival said, &quot;Arau is truly a renaissance artist, with a deep and innate understanding of all phases of the cinematic medium.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image: Acuaron.jpg|200px|thumb|Alfonso Cuaron]]'''Alfonso Cuarón Orozco''' (born [[November 28]], [[1961]] in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]) is a Mexican [[film director]].

Alfonso Cuarón grew up in the city as well; he went on to study both filmmaking and philosophy at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. After graduating, Cuaron began working in television in Mexico, first as a technician and then as a director. Cuaron's television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several [[Latin American]] film productions (including ''[[Gaby: A True Story]]'' and ''[[Romero]]''), and in 1991, he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment.

''[[Solo con tu pareja]]'' was a dark comedy about a womanizing businessman who learns he's contracted [[AIDS]]; the film was a massive hit in Mexico, and was enthusiastically received around the world. Director [[Sydney Pollack]] was impressed enough with ''[[Solo con tu pareja]]'' that he hired Cuaron to direct an episode of ''[[Fallen Angels]]'', a series of neo-noir stories produced for the Showtime premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included [[Steven Soderbergh]], [[Jonathan Kaplan]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], and [[Tom Hanks]].

In 1995, Cuarón released his first feature film produced in the United States, ''[[A Little Princess (1995 film)|A Little Princess]]'', an adaptation of [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s classic novel. Cuaron's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Great Expectations]]'' starring [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], and [[Robert De Niro]].

Cuarón's next project found him making a severe left turn; shot in [[Mexico]] with a Spanish-speaking cast, ''[[Y tu mamá también]]'' was a funny, provocative, and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive woman in her thirties. The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics. 

He also directed the third film in the successful ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (movie)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''.  Cuarón has faced criticism amongst the more puritanical Potter fans for &quot;ruining&quot; the Prisoner of Azkaban film; given that the first two instalments, helmed by [[Chris Columbus]], had adhered stringently to the books, Cuarón's rather more individualistic film (which brought with it a far darker tone, costume changes, omitted subplots and other changes to the accepted continuity) came as something of a shock to many fans. However, author [[J.K. Rowling]] has said that this movie is so far her personal favorite from the series, and remained the most critically lauded of the blockbuster series.

His next feature will be ''[[The Children of Men (film)|The Children of Men]]'' an adaptation of the [[P.D. James]] novel of the [[The Children of Men|same name]].

'''Arthur Meighen''', [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC]] , [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] , [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] , [[Doctor of Laws|LL.D]] ([[June 16]], [[1874]] – [[August 5]], [[1960]]) was the ninth [[Prime Minister of Canada]] from [[July 10]], [[1920]], to [[December 29]], [[1921]], and [[June 29]] to [[September 25]], [[1926]]. He was the first Prime Minister from [[Western Canada]] and the only, so far, from the Province of [[Manitoba]].  Both of his terms were brief, and the second was  unprecedented and arose partially out of conflicts between the [[Governor General of Canada]] and Meighen's rival, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]. 
==Background==
Meighen was born in [[Anderson, Ontario|Anderson]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. He graduated from the [[University of Toronto]], earning a B.A. in [[Mathematics]] in [[1896]].  In [[1904]] he married [[Isabel J. Cox]] ([[1882]] - [[1985]]) with whom he had two sons and one daughter. In 1990, one of his grandsons, [[Michael Meighen]] was appointed to the [[Canadian Senate]] on the recommendation of Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]].

Meighen experimented in several professions, including those of teacher, lawyer and businessman, before becoming involved in politics as a member of the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]].  In public, Meighen was a top class debater, and was known for his sharp wit.

==Cabinet==
He was first elected to the [[Canadian House of Commons]] in [[1908]], defeating incumbent [[John Crawford]] in the [[Manitoba]] riding of [[Portage La Prairie]].  He was re-elected in 1908 and [[1911]], and again in 1913 after being appointed [[Solicitor-General]] (at the time, newly appointed Ministers had to seek re-election).

Meighen served as Solicitor-General from [[June 26]], [[1913]], until [[August 25]], [[1917]], when he was appointed [[Minister of Mines]] and [[Secretary of State for Canada]].  In 1917, he was mainly responsible for implementing [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|conscription]]. Noteworthy was the government's decision to give votes to conscription supporters (soldiers and their families), while denying that right to potential opponents of conscription such as immigrants. He was again shifted on [[October 12]], [[1917]], this time to the positions of [[Minister of the Interior]] and [[Superintendent of Indian Affairs]].  

As Minister of the Interior, he steered the largest piece of legislation ever enacted in the British Commonwealth through Parliament - creating the Canadian National Railway Company, which continues today.  Meighen was re-appointed [[Minister of Mines]] on the last day of [[1920]].  In [[1919]], as acting [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] and senior Manitoban in the government of Sir [[Robert Laird Borden]], Meighen helped put down the [[Winnipeg General Strike of 1919|Winnipeg General Strike]] by force.
==First Term==
Meighen became leader of the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] and [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] Party and [[Prime Minister]] on [[July 7]], [[1920]], when Borden resigned.  He would quickly call an election.

Meighen fought the [[Canadian federal election, 1921|1921 election]] under the banner of the [[National Liberal and Conservative Party]] in an attempt to keep the allegiance of Liberals who had supported the [[World War I|wartime]] Unionist government. However, his actions in implementing Conscription hurt his party's already-weak support in Quebec, while the Winnipeg General Strike and farm tariffs made him unpopular among labour and farmers alike. The party was defeated by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] led by [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], and Meighen was personally defeated in [[Portage La Prairie]], falling to third place behind the newly-formed Progressive Party. He continued to lead the Conservative Party (which had reverted to its traditional name), and returned to parliament in [[1922]] for the eastern [[Ontario]] riding of [[Grenville County, Ontario|Grenville]].

==Opposition leader==
[[Image:Meighen biopg1 large.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Meighen was cast by opponents, especially in Quebec, as beholden to Britain's colonial actions.]]
Meighen's term as opposition leader would be most marked by his response to the [[Chanak Affair|crisis at Chanak]], in which Colonial secretary [[Winston Churchill]] leaked to the newspapers that the Dominions may be called upon to help British forces in the area. King refused to commit to sending troops, resenting the way Churchill went above the Dominion leader's heads.  King used the rationale that Parliament should decide, and that the matter was not important enough to recall Parliament.  Meighen strongly condemned his action, saying in a Toronto hotel, &quot;When Britain's messgage came, then Canada should have said, 'Ready, aye ready, we stand by you.'&quot;  When the crisis died down within days, Meighen was left with a reputation as blindly in favour of Britain's interests.

Meighen and King, unlike Laurier and Borden, had a very personal distrust and hatred for each other.  Megihen looked down on King, whom he called &quot;Rex&quot; (King's old University nickname), and considered him unprinicpled.

The Liberal government of Mackenzie King was soon beset with scandals and corruption.  Much of this was uncovered in a Royal Commission established to probe wrongdoing in Quebec, and in particular, in connection with building the Beauharnois Canal.  The [[Tories]] won a plurality of seats in the [[Canadian federal election, 1925 |inconclusive election of 1925]], but King was able to hold onto to power until [[1926]] through an alliance with the [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressives]].  Meighen denounced King staying in power, saying he was holding on to office like a &quot;lobster with lockjaw.&quot;

==Second term==
A scandal in the Customs department was soon found, making the Progressives wary of supporting King.  When King was on the verge of losing a vote in the Commons in 1926, he asked the Governor General, [[Julian H.G. Byng, Viscount Byng of Vimy|Lord Byng]], to call an election.  Despite every effort to cling to power, Mackenzie King's shaky government was defeated in the House of Commons.  King resigned and Meighen was invited to form a government, having secured a measure of support from the opposition farm parties. This became known as the &quot;[[King-Byng Affair]]&quot;, an attack by Mackenzie King on the Governor General's right to refuse an election where an alternative government is capable of commanding the support of the House of Commons.  

Because of the possibility of losing a vote in Commons while Megihen and his ministers were re-elected (a relic of British law dating to 1701 that was repealed in Canada in 1938), Meighen made his ministers &quot;acting&quot; ones, and did not give them the oath of office.  King made an uproar about the situation, attracting Progressive support to take down the government.  The government would lose confidence by one vote.  There being no other Parliamentary grouping to call upon, Byng called an election.  Meighan's party was swept from office, and Meighen was again defeated in [[Portage La Prairie]].  He resigned as Conservative Party leader shortly thereafter. 

==Afterward==
[[Image:Meighen56.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Meighen in 1956.]]

Meighen was appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] in 1932 by [[R.B. Bennett]].  He served as Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister without Portfolio from [[February 3]], [[1932]], to [[October 22]], [[1935]].  

In 1941, Meighen was prevailed upon to become leader of the Conservative Party again.  He resigned his Senate seat on [[January 16]], [[1942]], and campaigned in a by-election for the [[Toronto]] riding of [[York South]]. According to custom, the Liberals would not run a candidate in the riding. But King, still harbouring a deep hatred for Meighen and thinking that the ardently conscriptionist Meighen coming back into Commons would further imflame the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|conscription crisis]], would send resources to the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation|CCF]]'s [[Joseph Noseworthy]].  Meighen would go down to defeat, and once again withdrew from public life.

Arthur Meighen died in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], aged 86, on [[August 5]], [[1960]], and was buried in St. Mary's Cemetery, St. Mary's, Ontario, near his birthplace.

:'' This article is about theological views like those of Arius. [[Aryan]] is an unrelated ethnic concept.''
:''Arians may also refer to [[Polish brethren]].''

'''Arianism''' was a [[Christology|Christological]] view held by followers of [[Arius]], a Christian priest who lived and taught in [[Alexandria]], Egypt, in the early [[4th century]]. Arius taught that [[God the Father#God the Father in Christianity|God the Father]] and [[Godhead (Christianity)|the Son]] were not co-eternal, seeing the [[Incarnation#As used in the Christian tradition|pre-incarnate]] [[Jesus]] as a divine being but nonetheless created by (and consequently inferior to) the Father at some point, before which the Son did not exist.  In English-language works, it is sometimes said that Arians believe that Jesus is or was a &quot;creature&quot;; in this context, the word is being used in its original sense of &quot;created being.&quot;

The conflict between Arianism and the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] beliefs was the first major doctrinal confrontation in the Church after the legalization of Christianity by Emperor [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine I]]. Controversy over Arianism extended over the greater part of the fourth century and involved most church members, simple believers and monks as well as bishops and emperors. While Arianism did dominate for several decades in the family of the Emperor, the Imperial nobility and higher ranking clergy, in the end it was Trinitarianism which prevailed theologically and politically at the end of the fourth century, and which has since been a virtually uncontested doctrine in all major branches of the Eastern and Western Church. Arianism, which had been taught by the Arian missionary [[Ulfilas]] to the Germanic tribes, did linger for some centuries among several Germanic tribes in western Europe, especially [[Goths]] and [[Langobards]] but did not play any significant theological role thereafter.

==Beliefs==
Because most contemporary written material on Arianism was written by its opponents, the nature of Arius' teachings are difficult to define precisely today.  The letter of [[Auxentius]][http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/auxentius.trans.html], a [[4th century]] Arian [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|bishop of Milan]], regarding the missionary [[Ulfilas]], gives the clearest picture of Arian beliefs on the nature of the [[Trinity]]: God the Father (&quot;unbegotten&quot;), always existing, was separate from the lesser Jesus Christ (&quot;only-begotten&quot;), born before time began and creator of the world. The Father, working through the Son, created the Holy Spirit, who was subservient to the Son as the Son was to the Father. The Father was seen as &quot;the only true God.&quot; I Corinthians 8:5-6 was cited as proof text:

:&quot;Indeed, even though there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth — as in fact there are many gods and many lords — yet for us there is one God (''theos''), the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord (''kyrios''), Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.&quot; (NRSV)

== The Council of Nicea and its aftermath ==
In [[321]] Arius was denounced by a [[synod]] at Alexandria for teaching a heterodox view of the relationship of Jesus to God the Father. Because Arius and his followers had great influence in the schools of Alexandria &amp;mdash; counterparts to modern universities or seminaries &amp;mdash; their theological views spread, especially in the eastern Mediterranean. By [[325]] the controversy had become significant enough that Emperor Constantine called an assembly of bishops, the [[First Council of Nicea|First]] [[Ecumenical council|Council]] of [[Nicaea]] (modern Iznik, Turkey), which condemned Arius' doctrine and formulated the [[Nicene Creed]], which is still recited in [[Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Orthodox]], and some [[Protestant]] services. The Nicene Creed's central term, used to describe the relationship between the Father and the Son, is [[ousia|homoousios]], meaning &quot;of the same substance&quot; or &quot;of one being&quot;. (The [[Athanasian Creed]] is less often used but is a more overtly anti-Arian statement on the Trinity.)

Constantine exiled those who refused to accept the Nicean creed &amp;mdash; Arius himself, the deacon [[Euzoios]], and the Libyan bishops [[Theonas of Ptolemais]] and [[Secundus of Mamarica]] &amp;mdash; and also the bishops who signed the creed but refused to join in Arius' condemnation, [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]] and [[Theognis of Nicea]]. The Emperor also ordered all copies of the ''Thalia'', the book in which Arius had expressed his teachings, to be [[Book burning|burned]]. This ended the open theological dispute for a few years, though under the surface opposition to the Nicean creed remained.

Though he was committed to maintaining what the church had defined at Nicea, Constantine was also bent on pacifying the situation and eventually became more lenient towards those condemned and exiled at the council. First he allowed Eusebius of Nicomedia, who was a prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; of his sister, and Theognis to return once they had signed an ambiguous statement of faith. The two, and other friends of Arius, worked for Arius' rehabilitation. At the synod of Tyre in [[335]] they brought accusations against Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, the primary opponent of Arius; after this, Constantine had [[Athanasius]] banished, since he considered him an impediment to reconciliation. In the same year, the synod of Jerusalem readmitted Arius to communion, and in [[336]], Constantine allowed Arius to return to his hometown. Arius, however, died on the day he was scheduled to depart from Constantinople. Eusebius and Theognis remained in the Emperor's favour, and when Constantine, who had been a [[catechumen]] much of his adult life, accepted [[baptism]] on his deathbed, it was from Eusebius of Nicomedia.

== The theological debates reopen ==
The Council of Nicea had not ended the controversy, as many bishops of the Eastern provinces disputed the ''homoousios'', the central term of the Nicene creed, as it had been used by [[Paul of Samosata]], who had advocated a [[Monarchianism|monarchianist]] [[Christology]]. Both the man and his teaching, including the term ''homoousios'', had been condemned by synods in Antioch in [[269]].

Hence, after Constantine's death in [[337]], open dispute resumed again. Constantine's son Constantius II, who had become Emperor of the eastern part of the Empire actually encouraged the Arians and set out to reverse the Nicene creed. His advisor in these affairs was Eusebius of Nicomedia, who had already at the Council of Nicea been the head of the Arian party, who also was made bishop of Constantinople. 

Constantius used his power to exile bishops adhering to the Nicene creed, especially [[Athanasius]] of Alexandria, who fled to Rome. In [[355]] Constantius became the sole Emperor and extended his pro-Arian policy towards the western provinces, frequently using force to push through his creed, even exiling [[Pope Liberius]]. 

As debates raged in an attempt to come up with a new formula, three camps evolved among the opponents of the Nicene creed. The first group mainly opposed the Nicene terminology and preferred the term ''homoiousios'' (alike in substance) to the Nicene ''homoousios'', while they rejected Arius and his teaching and accepted the equality and coeternality of the persons of the Trinity.  Because of this centrist position, and despite their rejection of Arius, they were called &quot;semi-Arians&quot; by their opponents. The second group also avoided invoking the name of Arius, but in large part followed Arius' teachings and, in another attempted compromise wording, described the Son as being like (''homoi'') the Father. A third group explicitly called upon Arius and described the Son as unlike (''anhomoi'') the Father. Constantius wavered in his support between the first and the second party, while harshly persecuting the third.

The debates between these groups resulted in numerous synods among them [[Sardica]] in [[343]], the council of Sirmium in [[358]] and the double council of Rimini and Selecia in [[359]], and no less than fourteen further creed formulas between 340 and 360, and the pagan observer Ammianus Marcellinus commented sarcastically: &quot;The highways were covered with galloping bishops.&quot; None of these attempts were acceptable to the defenders of Nicene orthodoxy: writing about the latter councils, Saint [[Jerome]] remarked that the world &quot;awoke with a groan to find itself Arian.&quot;

After Constantius' death in [[361]], his successor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], a devotee of [[Paganism|Rome's pagan gods]], declared that he would no longer attempt to favor one church faction over another, and allowed all exiled bishops to return; this had the objective of further increasing dissension among Christians. The Emperor [[Valens]], however, revived Constantius' policy and supported the &quot;Homoian&quot; party, exiling bishops and often using force. During this persecution many bishops were exiled to the other ends of the Empire, (e.g., [[Hilarius of Poitiers]] to the Eastern provinces). These contacts and the common plight subsequently led to a rapprochement between the Western supporters of the Nicene creed and the ''homoousios'' and the Eastern semi-Arians.

After Valens' death in the [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of]] [[Adrianople]] in [[378]], the accession of [[Theodosius I]], who adhered to the Nicene creed, allowed for settling the dispute in [[381]]: at the [[Second Ecumenical Council]] in Constantinople, a group of mainly Eastern bishops assembled and accepted the Nicene Creed, which was supplemented in regard to the [[Holy Spirit]]. This is generally considered the end of the dispute about the Trinity and the end of Arianism among the Roman, non-Germanic peoples.

== Nicene Christianity becomes the state religion of Rome ==
{{cleanup-merge}}
In the 4th century, the Christian Church in the Roman Empire was wracked with controversy over the nature of the [[Trinity]].  In 325 AD, the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]] had condemned the teachings of the theologian [[Arius]]: that Jesus was a created being and inferior to God the Father, and that the Father and Son were of a similar substance (''homoiousion'' in Greek) but not identical.  The Council of Nicea had formulated the [[Nicene Creed]], which declared that Jesus and God the Father were of the same substance (''[[ousia|homoousion]]'' in Greek, a term which was condemned at the Council of Antioch in 264-268). The Council of Nicea did not settle these controversies, and by the time of Theodosius' accession, there were still several different church factions that sought to impose their views on Christianity as a whole. While no mainstream churchmen within the Empire explicitly adhered to Arius or his teachings, there were those who still used the ''homoiousion'' formula, as well as those who attempted to bypass the debate by merely saying that Jesus was like (''homoi'' in Greek) God the Father. All these non-Nicenes were frequently labeled as [[Arians]] (i.e., followers of Arius) by their opponents, though they would not have identified themselves as such.  (For a succinct survey of the situation just before Theodosius' accession, see ''Failure of Empire,'' Noel Lenski (U. of California Press, 2002, ISBN 0520233328) pp. 235-237)

The emperor Valens had favored the group who used the ''homoi'' formula; this theology was prominent in much of the East and had under the sons of Constantine the Great gained a foothold in the west.  Theodosius, on the other hand, cleaved closely to the Nicene Creed: this was the line that predominated in the West and was held by the important Alexandrian church.

Two days after Theodosius arrived in Constantinople, [[November 24]], [[380]], Theodosius expelled the non-Nicene bishop, [[Demophilus of Constantinople]], and surrendered the churches of that city to [[Gregory Nazianzus]], the leader of the small Nicene community there, an act which provoked rioting. Theodosius had just been baptized, by bishop Acholius of Thessalonica, during a severe illness, as was common in the early Christian world.  In February he and Gratian published an edict that all their subjects should profess the faith of the bishops of Rome and Alexandria (i.e., the Nicene faith).

Although much of the church hierarchy in the East had held non-Nicene positions in the decades leading up to Theodosius' accession, he managed to impose Nicene uniformity during his reign.  Later Nicene writers took special glee in the ignominious death of Valens, the Arians' protector, and indeed his defeat probably damaged the standing of the Homoian faction.

For the first part of his rule, Theodosius seems to have ignored the semi-official standing of the Christian bishops; in fact he had voiced his support for the preservation of temples or pagan statues as useful public buildings. Then, in a series of decrees called the '''Theodosian decrees''' he progressively declared that those pagan feasts that had not yet been rendered Christian ones were now to be workdays (in [[389]]). In [[391]], he outlawed [[Animal sacrifice|blood sacrifice]] and decreed &quot;no one is to go to the sanctuaries, walk through the temples, or raise his eyes to statues created by the labor of man&quot;. The temples that were thus closed could be declared &quot;abandoned&quot; as Bishop [[Theophilus of Alexandria]] immediately noted in applying for permission to demolish a site and cover it with a Christian church, an act that must have received general sanction, for [[Mithraism|mithraea]] forming crypts of churches and temples forming the foundations of 5th century churches appear throughout the former Roman Empire. Theodosius participated in actions by Christians against major cult sites: the destruction of the gigantic [[Serapeum]] of Alexandria and its library by a mob in around [[392]], authorized by Theodosius (''extirpium malum'') and described in exultant detail by Christian propagandists, was only the most spectacular such occasion (Peter Brown, ''The Rise of Western Christendom,''  2003, p. 73-74). The destruction of the greatest temple in Alexandria gave encouragement to Christian vigilantism and mob action in other centers, often spurred on by the local bishops, as early hagiographies proudly relate. 

By decree in 391, Theodosius ended the subsidies that had still trickled to some remnants of Greco-Roman civic paganism too. The [[Sacred fire of Vesta|eternal fire]] in the [[Vesta|Temple of Vesta]] in the [[Roman Forum]] was extinguished, and the [[Vestal Virgins]] were disbanded. Taking the auspices and practicing witchcraft were to be punished. Pagan members of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] in Rome appealed to him to restore the [[Altar of Victory]] in the Senate House; he refused. After the last [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] in [[393]], Theodosius cancelled the much-diminished games, and the reckoning of dates by [[Olympiad]]s soon came to an end.

Now Theodosius portrayed himself on his coins holding the [[labarum]].

The apparent change of policy that resulted in the &quot;Theodosian decrees&quot; has often been credited to the increased influence of [[Ambrose]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|bishop of Milan]]. The personal piety of Theodosius cannot be assessed. It is worth noting that in 390 Ambrose had excommunicated Theodosius, who had recently ordered the massacre of several thousand inhabitants of [[Thessalonica]], in response to the assassination of his military governor stationed in the city and that Theodosius performed several months of public penance. The specifics of the decrees were superficially limited in scope, specific measures in response to various petitions and accusations from the increasingly militant Christians throughout his administration. In 391 or 392 he officially sanctioned the destruction of the most famous of the temples in the East, the [[Serapeum]] at Alexandria.  Bands of monks and Christian officials had long been accustomed to take the law into their own hands and destroy various centers of pagan worship, but the destruction of the Serapeum seemed to confirm that such actions enjoyed the emperor's tacit approval at least, and served to encourage such action in the future. Theodosius had been effectively manipulated into sanctioning the destruction of the Serapeum by local officials who had essentially engineered the crisis there for this very purpose.

Ambrose preached a [[panegyric]] at Theodosius' [[funeral]].

== Arianism in the early medieval Germanic kingdoms ==
However, during the time of Arianism's flowering in [[Constantinople]], the [[Goths|Goth]] convert [[Ulfilas]] (later the subject of the letter of Auxentius cited above) was sent as a missionary to the Gothic barbarians across the [[Danube River|Danube]], a mission favored for political reasons by emperor [[Constantius]].  Ulfilas' initial success in converting this Germanic people to an Arian form of Christianity was strengthened by later events. When the Germanic peoples entered the [[Roman Empire]] and founded successor-kingdoms in the western part, most had been Arian Christians for more than a century.  

The conflict in the 4th century had seen Arian and Nicene factions struggling for control of the Church; in contrast, in the kingdoms these Arian Germans established on the wreckage of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, there were entirely separate Arian and Nicene Churches with parallel hierarchies, each serving different sets of believers, the Germanic elites being Arians and the majority population being trinitarian. Many scholars see the persistence of the Germans' Arian religion as a strategy to differentiate the Germanic elite from the local inhabitants and maintain their group identity against the local culture.

While most Germanic tribes in general were tolerant regarding the trinitarian beliefs of their subjects, the Vandals tried for several decennia to force their Arian belief on their North African trinitarian subjects, exiling trinitarian clergy, dissolving monasteries and exercising heavy pressure on non-conforming Christians.

For more information on these Arian kingdoms, see the articles on the [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]], [[Vandals]], [[Burgundians]], and [[Lombards]].  (The [[Franks]] were unique among the Germanic peoples in that they entered the empire as pagans and converted to Nicene Christianity directly.) By the beginning of the [[8th century]], these kingdoms had either been conquered by Nicene neighbors (Ostrogoths, Vandals, Burgundians) or their rulers had accepted Nicene Christianity (Visigoths, Lombards).

== &quot;Arian&quot; as a polemical epithet ==
In many ways, the conflict around Arian beliefs in the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries helped firmly define the centrality of the Trinity in mainstream Christian theology. As the first major intra-Christian conflict after Christianity's legalization, the struggle between Nicenes and Arians left a deep impression on the institutional memory of Nicene churches. Thus, over the past 1,500 years, some Christians have used the term ''Arian'' to refer to those groups that see themselves as worshipping Jesus Christ or respecting his teachings, but do not hold to the [[Nicene creed]].

Like the Arians, many groups have embraced the belief that Jesus is not the one God, but a separate being subordinate to the Father, and that Jesus at one time did not exist. Some of these profess, as the Arians did, that God made all things through the pre-existent Christ. Some profess that Jesus became divine, through exaltation, just as the Arians believed. Drawing a parallel between these groups and Arians can be useful for distinguishing a type of unbelief in the Trinity. But, despite the frequency with which this name is used as a polemical label, there has been no historically continuous survival of Arianism into the modern era. The groups so labelled do not hold beliefs identical to Arianism. For this reason, they do not use the name as a self-description, even if they acknowledge that their beliefs are at points in agreement with, or in broad terms similar to, Arianism.

Those whose religious beliefs have been compared to or labeled as Arianism include:

*[[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], who believe that God is one as opposed to a Trinity, and many of whom believe in the moral authority, but not the deity, of Jesus.
*[[Jehovah's Witnesses]], who hold that at one point in time Jesus did not exist.
*[[Christadelphians]], who believe that Jesus' pre-natal existence was conceptual, as the &quot;Logos&quot;, rather than literal.
*Followers of the various churches of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], who believe in the unity in purpose of the Godhead but that Jesus is a divine being separate from and subordinate to God the Father.
*[[Islam|Muslims]], who believe that Jesus (generally called [[Isa]]), was a prophet of the one God, but not himself divine.

For more on the theology of these groups, see their respective articles.

[[Image:Sesterius-Antoninus Pius-Italia-RIC 0746a.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Sestertius]] of Antoninus Pius, with the personification of [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]] on reverse. Antoninus had been entrusted with the government of this province as [[proconsul]].]]
'''Titus Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus Pius''' ([[September 19]], [[86]]&amp;ndash;[[March 7]] [[161]]) was [[Roman Emperors|Roman emperor]] from [[138]] to [[161]]. He was the fourth of the [[Five Good Emperors]] and a member of the [[Aurelii]]. 

He was the son of [[Titus Aurelius Fulvus]], [[consul]] in [[89]] whose family came from [[Nemausus]] (modern-day [[Nîmes]]), and was born near [[Lanuvium]]. After the death of his father, he was brought up under the care of [[Arrius Antoninus]], his maternal grandfather, a man of integrity and culture, and a friend of [[Pliny the Younger]].

Having filled with more than usual success the offices of [[quaestor]] and [[praetor]], he obtained the consulship in [[120]]; he was next appointed by the Emperor [[Hadrian]] as one of the four [[proconsul]]s to administer [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]], then greatly increased his reputation by his conduct as [[proconsul]] of [[Asia Province|Asia]]. He acquired much favour with the Emperor Hadrian, who adopted him as his son and successor on [[February 25]], 138, after the death of his first adopted son [[Aelius Verus]], on the condition that he himself would adopt Marcus Annius Verus, the son of his wife's brother, and Lucius, son of Aelius Verus, who afterwards became the emperors [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus|Lucius Aelius Verus]] (colleague of Marcus Aurelius).

Antoninus in many ways was the ideal of the landed gentleman praised not only by ancient Romans, but also by later scholars of classical history, such as [[Edward Gibbon]] or the author of the article on Antoninus Pius in the ninth edition of the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopedia Britannica]]:

: A few months afterwards, on Hadrian's death, he was enthusiastically welcomed to the throne by the Roman people, who, for once, were not disappointed in their anticipation of a happy reign. For Antoninus came to his new office with simple tastes, kindly disposition, extensive experience, a well-trained intelligence and the sincerest desire for the welfare of his subjects. Instead of plundering to support his prodigality, he emptied his private treasury to assist distressed provinces and cities, and everywhere exercised rigid economy (hence the nickname &amp;kappa;&amp;upsilon;&amp;mu;&amp;iota;&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;pi;&amp;rho;&amp;iota;&amp;sigma;&amp;tau;&amp;eta;&amp;sigmaf; &quot;cummin-splitter&quot;). Instead of exaggerating into treason whatever was susceptible of unfavorable interpretation, he spurned the very conspiracies that were formed against him into opportunities for demonstrating his clemency. Instead of stirring up persecution against the Christians, he extended to them the strong hand of his protection throughout the empire. Rather than give occasion to that oppression which he regarded as inseparable from an emperor's progress through his dominions, he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome, or its neighbourhood.

Of the public transactions of this period we have scant information, but, to judge by what we possess, those twenty-two years were not remarkably eventful in comparison to those before and after his; the surviving evidence is not complete enough to determine whether we should interpret, with older scholars, that he wisely curtailed the activities of the Roman Empire to a careful minimum, or perhaps that he was uninterested in events away from Rome and [[Italy]] and his inaction contributed to the pressing troubles that faced not only Marcus Aurelius but also the emperors of the [[third century]].

[[Image:RomaForoRomanoTempioAntoninoFaustina.JPG|thumb|Temple of Antoninus and [[Faustina the Elder|Faustina]] in the [[Roman forum]] (now the church of [[San Lorenzo in Miranda]]). The emperor and his ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' were deified after their death by [[Marcus Aurelius]].]]

One of his first acts as Emperor was to persuade the [[Roman Senate |Senate]] to grant divine honours to Hadrian, which they had at first refused; his efforts to persuade the Senate to grant these honours is one of the reasons given for his title of ''Pius'' (dutiful in affection; compare ''[[pietas]]''). Two other reasons for this title are that he would support his aged father-in-law with his hand at Senate meetings, and that he had saved those men that Hadrian, during his period of ill-health, had condemned to death. He built temples, theaters, and mausoleums, promoted the arts and sciences, and bestowed honours and salaries upon the teachers of [[rhetoric]] and [[philosophy]].

His reign was comparatively peaceful; there were several military disturbances throughout the Empire in his time, in [[Mauretania]], [[Iudaea (Roman province)|Iudaea]], and amongst the [[Brigantes]] in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], but none of them are considered serious. The unrest in Britannia is believed to have led to the construction of the [[Antonine Wall]] from the [[Firth of Forth]] to the [[Firth of Clyde]], although it was soon abandoned.

In his domestic relations Antoninus was not so fortunate.  His wife, [[Faustina the Elder]], has almost become a byword for her lack of womanly virtue; but she seems to have kept her hold on his affections to the last. On her death in the third year of his reign, he honoured her memory by the foundation of a [[charity]] for orphan girls, who bore the name of ''Alimentariae Faustinianae'', following the practice of prior emperors in endowing an ''[[alimentaria]]'' to promote the welfare of children and an increased population.  He had by her two sons and two daughters; but they all died before his elevation to the throne, except [[Annia Faustina]], who became the wife of Marcus Aurelius. 

Antoninus died of fever at [[Lorium]] in [[Etruria]], about twelve miles from Rome, on [[March 7]] 161, giving the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when the [[tribune]] of the night-watch came to ask the password &amp;mdash; &quot;aequanimitas&quot;.

The only account of his life handed down to us is that of Julius Capitolinus, one of the ''[[Scriptores Historiae Augustae]]''.

===Contacts with China===
The [[Hou Hanshu]] (History of the Later Han [[China|Chinese]] dynasty) recounted the first of several [[Roman embassies to China]] sent out by Emperor Antoninus Pius.  The mission came from the South, and therefore probably by sea, entering China by the frontier of [[Jinan]] or [[Tonkin]], bringing presents of [[rhinoceros]] horns, ivory, and [[tortoise shell]] which had probably been acquired in [[Southern Asia]].

The emperor was most likely [[Marcus Aurelius]], who was the reigning emperor. Antoninus Pius died in 161, while the convoy arrived in [[166]].  The confusion arises because Marcus Aurelius took as additional names, those of his predecessor as a mark of respect. He is referred to in Chinese history as &quot;An Tun&quot; (= Antoninus), hence the confusion. 

The mission reached the Chinese capital of [[Luoyang]] in 166 and was met by [[Emperor Huan of Han China|Emperor Huan]] of the [[Han Dynasty]]. About the same time, and possibly through this embassy, the Chinese acquired a treatise of [[astronomy]] from [[Daqin]] (Rome).

{{commons|Antonine Wall}}

The '''Antonine Wall''' is a [[rock (geology)|stone]] and [[sod|turf]] [[fortification]], built by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s across what is now the [[central belt]] of [[Scotland]].

Construction of the Antonine Wall began in [[142]] CE during the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]], and was completed in [[144]]. The wall stretches 60 [[kilometre]]s (37 [[mile]]s) from [[Old Kirkpatrick, Scotland|Old Kirkpatrick]] in [[West Dunbartonshire]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]] to [[Bo'ness]], [[Falkirk (council area)|Falkirk]], on the [[Firth of Forth]]. The wall was intended to replace [[Hadrian's Wall]] 160 km (100 miles) to the south, as the frontier of ''[[Roman Britain|Britannia]]'', but while the Romans did establish temporary forts and camps north of the wall, they did not conquer the [[Caledonians]], and the Antonine Wall suffered many attacks. The Romans called the land north of the wall ''[[Caledonia]]''.

The Antonine Wall was inferior to Hadrian's Wall in terms of scale and construction, but it was still an impressive achievement, considering that it was completed in only two years, at the northern edge of the Roman [[empire]] in what they perceived as a cold and hostile land. The wall was typically an earth bank, about four metres high, with a wide [[ditch]] on the north side, and a [[Roman road|military way]] or road on the south. The Romans initially planned to build forts every six miles, but this was soon revised to every two miles, resulting in a total of 19 forts along the wall.

The wall was abandoned after only 20 years, when the [[Roman legion]]s withdrew to Hadrian's Wall in AD [[164]]. After a series of attacks in AD [[197]], Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] arrived in Scotland in AD [[208]] to secure the frontier, and repaired parts of the wall. Although this re-occupation only lasted a few years, the wall is sometimes referred to (by later Roman historians) as the '''Severan Wall'''.

Although most of the wall has been destroyed over time, sections of the wall can still be seen in [[Bearsden]], [[Kirkintilloch]], [[Twechar]], [[Croy, North Lanarkshire|Croy]], [[Falkirk, Scotland|Falkirk]] and [[Polmont, Scotland|Polmont]].

In [[cryptography]], the '''Advanced Encryption Standard''' ('''AES'''), also known as '''Rijndael''', is a [[block cipher]] adopted as an [[encryption]] standard by the [[United States|US]] government.  It is expected to be used worldwide and analysed extensively, as was the case with its predecessor, the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES). AES was adopted by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) as US [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] PUB 197 in [[November]] [[2001]] after a 5-year standardisation process (see [[Advanced Encryption Standard process]] for more details). 

The cipher was developed by two [[Belgium|Belgian]] cryptographers, [[Joan Daemen]] and [[Vincent Rijmen]], and submitted to the AES selection process under the name &quot;Rijndael&quot;, a [[portmanteau]] comprising the names of the inventors. Rijndael can be pronounced &quot;Rhine dahl&quot;, a long &quot;[[i]]&quot; and a silent &quot;[[e]]&quot; ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[&amp;#633;aindal]}}). In the sound file linked below, it is pronounced {{IPA|[r&amp;#688;aindau]}}.

==Development==
Rijndael was a refinement of an earlier design by Daemen and Rijmen, [[Square (cipher)|Square]]; Square was a development from [[Shark (cipher)|Shark]].

Unlike its predecessor DES, Rijndael is a [[substitution-permutation network]], not a [[Feistel network]]. AES is fast in both [[computer software|software]] and [[hardware]], is relatively easy to implement, and requires little [[computer memory|memory]]. As a new encryption  standard, it is currently being deployed on a large scale.

Strictly speaking, AES is not precisely Rijndael (although in practice they are used interchangeably) as Rijndael supports a larger range of [[block size (cryptography)|block]] and [[key size]]s; AES has a fixed block size of 128 [[bit]]s and a key size of 128, 192 or 256 bits, whereas Rijndael can be specified with key and block sizes in any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 bits and a maximum of 256 bits.

The key is expanded using [[Rijndael key schedule|Rijndael's key schedule]].

Most of AES calculations are done in a special [[Finite field arithmetic|finite field]].

AES operates on a 4&amp;times;4 array of [[byte]]s, termed the ''state'' (versions of Rijndael with a larger block size have additional columns in the state). For encryption, each round of AES (except the last round) consists of four stages:
# &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; each byte of the state is combined with the round key; each round key is derived from the cipher key using a [[key schedule]].
# &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; a non-linear substitution step where each byte is replaced with another according to a [[Rijndael S-box|lookup table]].
# &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; a transposition step where each row of the state is shifted cyclically a certain number of steps.
# &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; a mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column using a linear transformation.
The final round replaces the &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; stage with another instance of &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt;.

===The &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt; step===
In the &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt; step, the subkey is combined with the state. For each round, a subkey is derived from the main [[key (cryptography)|key]] using the [[Rijndael key schedule|key schedule]]; each subkey is the same size as the state. The subkey is added by combining each byte of the state with the corresponding byte of the subkey using bitwise [[XOR]].

===The &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt; step===
In the &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt; step, each byte in the array is updated using an 8-bit [[Rijndael S-box|S-box]]. This operation provides the non-linearity in the [[cipher]]. The S-box used is derived from the [[inverse function]] over '''[[Finite field|GF]]'''(''2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;''), known to have good non-linearity properties. To avoid attacks based on simple algebraic properties, the S-box is constructed by combining the inverse function with an invertible [[affine transformation]]. The S-box is also chosen to avoid any fixed points (and so is a [[derangement]]), and also any opposite fixed points.

The S-box is more fully described in the article [[Rijndael S-box]].

===The &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; step===
The &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; step operates on the rows of the state; it cyclically shifts the bytes in each row by a certain offset. For AES, the first row is left unchanged. Each byte of the second row is shifted one to the left. Similarly, the third and fourth rows are shifted by offsets of two and three respectively. In this way, each column of the output state of the &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; step is composed of bytes from each column of the input state. (Rijndael variants with a larger block size have slightly different offsets).

===The &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; step===
In the &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; step, the four bytes of each column of the state are combined using an invertible linear transformation.  The &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; function takes four bytes as input and outputs four bytes, where each input byte affects all four output bytes.  Together with &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; provides [[diffusion (cryptography)|diffusion]] in the cipher. Each column is treated as a polynomial over '''GF'''(''2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'') and is then multiplied modulo &lt;math&gt;x^4+1&lt;/math&gt; with a fixed polynomial &lt;math&gt;c(x) = 3x^3 + x^2 + x + 2&lt;/math&gt;.  The &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; step can also be viewed as a matrix multiply in [[Finite field arithmetic|Rijndael's finite field]].  

This process is described further in the article [[Rijndael mix columns]].

===Optimization of the cipher===
On systems with 32-bit or larger words, it is possible to speed up execution of this cipher by converting the &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; transformations into tables.  One then has four 256-entry 32-bit tables, which utilizes a total of four kilobytes (4096 bytes) of memory--a kilobyte for each table.  A round can now be done with 16 table lookups and 12 32-bit exclusive-or operations, followed by four 32-bit exclusive-or operations in the &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt; step.

If the resulting four kilobyte table size is too large for a given target platform, the table lookup operation can be performed with a single 256-entry 32-bit table by the use of circular rotates.

==Security==
[[As of 2006]], the only successful attacks against AES have been [[side channel attack]]s.  The [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) reviewed all the AES finalists, including Rijndael, and stated that all of them were secure enough for [[US Government]] non-classified data. In June 2003, the US Government announced that AES may be used for [[classified information]]:
:&quot;''The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm (i.e., 128, 192 and  256) are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level.  TOP  SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths.  The  implementation of AES in products intended to protect national security systems and/or  information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use.''&quot; &amp;mdash; [http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssp_15_fs.pdf]
This marks the first time that the public has had access to a cipher approved by NSA for TOP SECRET information.  It is interesting to note that many public products use 128-bit secret keys by default; it is possible that NSA suspects a fundamental weakness in keys this short, or they may simply prefer a safety margin for top secret documents (which may require security decades into the future).  

The most common way to attack block ciphers is to try various attacks on versions of the cipher with a reduced number of rounds. AES has 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys. [[As of 2006]], the best known attacks are on 7 rounds for 128-bit keys, 8 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 9 rounds for 256-bit keys (Ferguson et al, 2000 {{ref|improved}}).

Some cryptographers worry about the security of AES. They feel that the margin between the number of rounds specified in the cipher and the best known attacks is too small for comfort. The risk is that some way to improve these attacks might be found and that, if so, the cipher could be broken. In this meaning, a [[cryptanalysis|cryptographic]] &quot;break&quot; is anything faster than an [[brute force attack|exhaustive search]], so an attack against 128-bit key AES requiring 'only' 2&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; operations would be considered a break even though it would be, now, quite infeasible. In practical application, any break of AES which is only this 'good' would be irrelevant. For the moment, such concerns can be ignored.  The largest publicly-known brute-force attack has been against a 64 bit [[RC5]] key by [[distributed.net]] (finishing in 2002; [[Moore's Law]] implies that this is roughly equivalent to an attack on a 66-bit key today).  

Another concern is the [[mathematics|mathematical]] structure of AES. Unlike most other block ciphers, AES has a very neat mathematical description [http://www.macfergus.com/pub/rdalgeq.html], [http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~sean/]. This has not yet led to any attacks, but some researchers are worried that future attacks may find a way to exploit this structure.

In [[2002]], a theoretical attack, termed the &quot;[[XSL attack]]&quot;, was announced by [[Nicolas Courtois]] and [[Josef Pieprzyk]], showing a potential weakness in the AES algorithm.  Several cryptography experts have found problems in the underlying mathematics of the proposed attack, suggesting that the authors may have made a mistake in their estimates.  Whether this line of attack can be made to work against AES remains an open question. For the moment, the XSL attack against AES appears speculative; it is unlikely that anyone could carry out the current attack in practice.

===Side channel attacks===
Side channel attacks do not attack the underlying cipher, but attack implementations of the cipher on systems which inadvertently leak data.

In April 2005, [[Daniel J. Bernstein|D.J. Bernstein]] announced a [http://cr.yp.to/papers.html#cachetiming cache timing attack] that he used to break a custom server that used [[OpenSSL]]'s AES encryption.  The custom server was designed to give out as much timing information as possible, and the attack required over 200 million chosen plaintexts.  Some say the attack is not practical against real-world implementations [http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=42620794%40news.cadence.com]; [[Bruce Schneier]] called the research a &quot;nice timing attack.&quot; [http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/05/aes_timing_atta_1.html]

In October 2005, Adi Shamir and two other researchers presented a paper demonstrating several [http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~tromer/papers/cache.pdf cache timing attacks]([[PDF]] file) against AES.  One attack was able to obtain an entire AES key after only 800 writes, in 65 milliseconds.  These attacks require the attacker to be able to run programs on the same system that is performing AES encryptions.

'''Anisotropy''' (the opposite of [[isotropy]]) is the property of being directionally dependent. 

In the field of [[computer graphics]], an anisotropic surface will change in appearance as it is rotated about its geometric [[surface normal|normal]], as is the case with [[velvet]]. Anisotropic scaling occurs when something is scaled by different amounts in different directions.  An example is down-scaling a 64&amp;times;64-pixel [[texture]] to cover a 12&amp;times;34-pixel [[rectangle]]; this is [[anisotropic filtering]]. 

An anisotropic [[filter]], on the other hand, is a filter with increasingly smaller [[interstitial]] spaces in the direction of filtration so that the [[proximal]] [[region]]s filter 
out larger particles and [[distal]] regions increasingly remove smaller particles, resulting in greater flow-through and more efficient filtration.

[[Cosmologists]] use the term to describe the fluctuations in the [[background radiation]] left over after the [[big bang]]. The term refers to the difference in the temperature of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] with direction. 

An anisotropic liquid is one which has the fluidity of a normal liquid, but, unlike water or [[chloroform]], which contain no structural ordering of the molecules, they have an average structural order relative to each other along their molecular axis. [[Liquid crystals]] are examples of anisotropic liquids.

Some materials [[heat conduction|conduct heat]] in a way that is isotropic, that is independent of spatial orientation around the heat source.  It is more common for heat conduction to be anisotropic, which implies that detailed geometric modeling of typically diverse materials being thermally managed is required. The materials used to transfer and reject heat from the heat source in [[electronics]] are often anisotropic. 

[[Geological]] formations where distinct layers of sedimentary material are disposited can exhibit electrical anisotropy. That is electrical [[conductivity]] in one direction e.g. parallel to a layer, is different to that in another e.g. perpendicular to a layer. This property is used in the gas and [[oil exploration]] industry to identify hydrocarbon-bearing sands in sequences of [[sand]] and [[shale]]. Sand bearing [[hydrocarbon]] assets have high resistivity (relatively low conductivity) whereas shales are much more conductive. [[Formation evaluation]] instruments measure this conductivity and [[resistivity]] and the results are used to help best site oil and gas wells.

Many [[crystal]]s are anisotropic to [[light]], and exhibit properties such as [[birefringence]]. [[Crystal optics]] describes light propagation in these media.

      <comment>An alpha particle is the same thing as a helium *nucleus*, not a helium *atom*</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Nuclear_processes}}
'''Alpha decay''' is a form of [[radioactivity|radioactive]] decay in which an [[atomic nucleus]] ejects an [[alpha particle]] through the electromagnetic force and transforms into a nucleus with [[atomic weight|mass number]] 4 less and [[atomic number]] 2 less.
For example:
:&lt;math&gt;
{}^2{}^{38}_{92}\hbox{U}\;\to\;{}^2{}^{34}_{90}\hbox{Th}\;+\;{}^4_2\hbox{He}^{2+},
&lt;/math&gt;
although this is usually written as:
:&lt;math&gt;
{}^{238}\hbox{U}\;\to\;^{234}\hbox{Th}\;+\;\alpha.
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that an [[alpha particle]] is a [[helium]] nucleus, and that both mass number and atomic number are conserved.
Alpha decay can essentially be thought of as [[nuclear fission]] where the parent nucleus splits into two daughter nuclei. Alpha decay is fundamentally a [[quantum tunneling]] process. Unlike [[beta decay]], alpha decay is governed by the [[strong nuclear force]].

Alpha particles with their typical kinetic energy of 5 MeV (that is ≈0.13% of their total energy, i.e. 110 TJ/kg), have a speed of 15,000 km/s.

Because of alpha decay, virtually all of the [[helium]] produced in the [[United States]] and elsewhere comes from trapped underground deposits associated with minerals containing [[uranium]] or [[thorium]], and brought to the surface as a by-product of [[natural gas]] production. 


[[Alpha particles]] emitted by radioactive nuclei are among the most hazardous forms of [[ionizing radiation|radiation]], if these nuclei are incorporated within a human body. As any heavy charged particle, alpha particles lost their energy in very short distance in dense media, causing significant damage to surrounding biomolecules. On the other hand, the external alpha irradiation cannot cause any damages because alphas are completely absorbed by a very thin ([[micrometer]]s) dead layer of [[skin]] as well as by few centimeters of air. However, if a substance radiating alpha particles is injected, ingested or inhaled by an organism it may become a risk, potentially inflicting very serious damage to the [[organism]]s' [[genetics|genetic]] makeup.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''analytical engine''', an important step in the [[history of computers]], is the design of a mechanical modern general-purpose [[computer]] by the British professor of mathematics [[Charles Babbage]]. It was first described in [[1837]], but Babbage continued to work on the design until his death in [[1871]]. Because of financial, political, and legal issues, the engine was never actually built. General-purpose computers that were logically comparable to the analytical engine did not come into existence until about 100 years later.

Some believe that the technological limitations of the time were a further obstacle to the construction of the machine; others believe that the machine could have been built successfully with the technology of the era if funding and political support had been stronger.

==Design==
Charles Babbage's first attempt at a mechanical computing device was the [[difference engine]], a special-purpose computer designed to tabulate [[logarithm]]s and [[trigonometric function]]s by evaluating approximate [[polynomial]]s. As this project faltered for personal and political reasons, he realized that a much more general design was possible, he started work designing the analytical engine.

The analytical engine was to be powered by a [[steam engine]] and would have been over 30 meters long and 10 meters wide. The input (programs and data) was to be provided to the machine on [[punch card]]s, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical [[loom|looms]]. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. It employed ordinary base-10 fixed-point arithmetic. There was a store (i.e., a memory) capable of holding 1,000 numbers of 50 digits each. An arithmetical unit (the &quot;mill&quot;) would be able to perform all four arithmetical operations.

The programming language to be employed was akin to modern day [[assembly language|assembly languages]]. Loops and conditional branching were possible and so the language as conceived would have been [[Turing-complete]]. Three different types of punch cards were used: one for arithmetical operations, one for numerical constants, and one for load and store operations, transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back. There were three separate readers for the three types of cards.

In 1842, the Italian mathematician [[Federico Luigi, Conte Menabrea|Luigi Menabrea]], whom Babbage had met while travelling in Italy, wrote a description of the engine in French. In [[1843]], the description was translated into English and extensively annotated by [[Ada Lovelace|Ada King, Countess of Lovelace]], who had become interested in the engine ten years earlier. In recognition of [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|her additions to Menabrea's paper]], she has been described as the first computer [[programmer]]. The modern computer programming language [[Ada programming language|Ada]] is named in her honor.

==Partial construction==
In [[1878]], a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science recommended against constructing the analytical engine, which sank Babbage's efforts for government funding.

In [[1910]], Babbage's son Henry P. Babbage reported that a part of the mill and the printing apparatus had been constructed
and had been used to calculate a (faulty) list of multiples of [[pi]]. This constituted only a small part of the whole engine; it was not programmable and had no storage.

==Influence==

===Computer science===
The analytical engine was then all but forgotten with three known exceptions. [[Percy Ludgate]] wrote about the engine in 1915 and even designed his own analytical engine (it was drawn up in detail but never built). Ludgate's engine would be much smaller than Babbage's of about 8 cubic feet (230 L) and hypothetically would be capable of multiplying two 20-decimal-digit numbers in about 6 seconds. [[Leonardo Torres y Quevedo]] and [[Vannevar Bush]] also knew of Babbage's work, though the three inventors likely did not know of each other. 

Closely related to Babbage's work on the analytical engine was the work of [[George Stibitz]] of [[Bell Laboratories]] in [[New York]] just prior to [[World War II|WWII]] and [[Howard Aiken|Howard Hathaway Aiken]] at [[Harvard]], during and just after WWII. They both built electromechanical (i.e. relay-and-switch) computers which were closely related to the analytical engine, though neither was (quite) a modern programmable computer. Aiken's machine was largely financed by [[IBM]] and was called the [[Harvard Mark I]]. 

From Babbage's autobiography:
:''As soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide the future course of the science. ''

===Fiction===
The [[cyberpunk]] novelists [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]] co-authored a [[steampunk]] novel of [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternative history]] entitled ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' in which Babbage's difference and analytical engines became available to Victorian society. The novel explores the consequences and implications of the early introduction of computational technology.

'''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''' ([[Latin]]:&lt;small&gt;Imperator Caesari Divi Filius Augustus&lt;/small&gt;) [[#Notes|&amp;sup1;]] ([[23 September]] [[63 BC]] &amp;ndash; [[19 August]] [[14|AD&amp;nbsp;14]]), known to modern historians as '''Octavian''' for the period of his life prior to [[27 BC]], is considered the first and one of the most important [[Roman Emperors]], though he downplayed his own position by preferring the traditional Republic title of ''[[princeps]],'' usually translated as &quot;first citizen&quot;.  Although he preserved the outward form of the [[Roman Republic]], he ruled as an [[autocrat]] for more than 40 years and his rule is the dividing line between the Republic and the [[Roman Empire]]. He ended a century of [[Civil war|civil wars]] and gave Rome an era of peace, prosperity, and imperial greatness, known as the ''[[Pax Romana]]'', the Roman peace. He was married to [[Livia Drusilla]] for 51 years.

==Early life==
Augustus was born in Rome with the name '''Gaius Octavius'''. His father, also [[Gaius Octavius]], came from a respectable but undistinguished family of the [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] order and was governor of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]. Shortly after Octavius's birth, his father gave him the surname of '''Thurinus''', possibly to commemorate his victory at [[Thurii]] over a rebellious band of slaves.  His mother, [[Atia|Atia Balba Caesonia]], was the niece of [[Julius Caesar]], soon to be Rome's most successful general and [[Dictator]] for Life. He spent his early years in his grandfather's house near Veletrae (modern [[Velletri]]). In [[58 BC]], when he was four, his father died. He spent most of his childhood in the house of his stepfather, [[Lucius Marcius Philippus]].

In [[51 BC]], aged eleven, he delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother [[Julia Caesaris]]. He put on the ''[[toga virilis]]'' at fifteen, and was elected to the [[College of Pontiffs]]. Caesar requested that Octavius join his staff for his campaign in [[Africa (province)|Africa]], but Atia protested that he was too young. The following year, [[46 BC]], she consented for him to join Caesar in [[Hispania]], but he fell ill and was unable to travel. When he had recovered, he sailed to the front, but was shipwrecked; after coming ashore with a handful of companions, he made it across hostile territory to Caesar's camp, which impressed his great-uncle considerably. Caesar and Octavius returned home in the same carriage, and Caesar secretly changed his will.

==Rise to power==
[[Image:aug11_01.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Bust of Caesar Augustus.]]

When [[Julius Caesar#Assassination|Caesar was assassinated]] in March 44 BC, Octavius was studying in Apollonia, in what is now [[Albania]]. When Caesar's will was read it revealed that, having no legitimate children, he had adopted his great-nephew as his son and main heir. By virtue of his [[adoption in Rome|adoption]], Octavius assumed the name Gaius Julius Caesar.  Roman tradition dictated that he also append the surname ''Octavianus'' to indicate his biological family, from which historians derive the name ''Octavian''; however, no evidence exists that he ever used the name ''Octavianus''. [[Mark Antony]] later charged that he had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favors, though [[Suetonius]] describes Antony's accusation as political slander.{{ref|slander}}

Octavian, as he is now conventionally called, recruited a small force in Apollonia.  Crossing over to Italy, he bolstered his personal forces with Caesar's veteran legionaries, gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to Caesar. Only eighteen years old, he was consistently underestimated by his rivals for power.

In Rome, he found Marcus Antonius ([[Mark Antony]]) in control. After a tense standoff, and a war in Gaul after Antony tried to take control of the province from [[Decimus Brutus]], he formed an uneasy alliance with [[Mark Antony]] and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], Caesar's principal colleagues. The three formed a [[junta]] called the [[Second Triumvirate]], an explicit grant of special powers lasting five years and supported by law, unlike the unofficial [[First Triumvirate]] of [[Pompey]], Caesar and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]].{{ref|2ndTri}} 

The triumvirs then set in motion proscriptions in which three hundred senators and two thousand ''[[Equestrian (Roman)|equites]]'' were deprived of their property and, for those who failed to escape, their lives, going beyond a simple purge of those allied with the assassins, and probably motivated by a need to raise money to pay their troops.{{ref|pros}}

Antony and Octavian then marched against Brutus and Cassius, who had fled to the east. At [[Philippi]] in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], the Caesarian army was victorious and Brutus and Cassius committed [[suicide]] ([[42 BC]]). While Octavian returned to Rome, Antony went to [[Egypt]] where he allied himself with Queen [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]], the ex-lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesar's infant son, [[Caesarion]]. 

While in Egypt, Antony had an affair with Cleopatra that resulted in the birth of three children, [[Alexander Helios]], [[Cleopatra Selene (II)|Cleopatra Selene]], and [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]]. Antony later left Cleopatra to make a strategic marriage with Octavian's sister [[Octavia]] in [[40 BC]]. During their marriage Octavia gave birth to two daughters, both named [[Antonia]]. In [[37 BC]] Antony deserted Octavia and went back to Egypt to be with Cleopatra. The Roman dominions were then divided between Octavian in the west and Antony in the east. 

Antony occupied himself with military campaigns in the east and a romantic affair with Cleopatra; Octavian built a network of allies in Rome, consolidated his power, and spread [[propaganda]] implying that Antony was becoming less than Roman because of his preoccupation with Egyptian affairs and traditions. The situation grew more and more tense, and finally, in [[32 BC]], Octavian declared war. It was quickly decided: in the bay of [[Battle of Actium|Actium]] on the western coast of Greece, after Antony's men began deserting, the fleets met in a great battle in which many ships burned and thousands on both sides lost their lives. Octavian defeated his rivals who then fled to Egypt. He pursued them, and after another defeat, Antony committed suicide. Cleopatra also committed suicide after her upcoming role in Octavian's triumph was &quot;carefully explained to her&quot; and [[Caesarion]], the supposed son of Julius Caesar by Cleopatra, was &quot;butchered without compunction&quot;.    Augustus supposedly said &quot;two Caesars are one too many&quot; as he ordered Caesarion's death.{{ref|suicide}}.  It is said that Cleopatra used a snake to kill herself.

==Octavian becomes Augustus: the creation of the Principate==
[[Image:Caesar augustus.jpg|right|thumb|200px|&lt;small&gt;Augustus as a magistrate&lt;/small&gt;]]

The Western half of the Empire had sworn allegiance to Octavian prior to Actium in [[30 BC]], and after Actium and the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra, the Eastern half of the Empire followed suit, placing Octavian in the position of ruler of the entire Empire. Years of civil war had left [[Rome]] in a state of near-lawlessness, but the Republic was not prepared to accept the control of Octavian as a [[despot]]. At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars amongst the Roman generals, and even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the City and provinces. Disbanding his personal forces, Octavian held elections and took up the position of [[consul]]; as such, though he had given up his personal armies, he was now legally in command of the legions of Rome.

===The First Settlement===
In [[27 BC]] he officially returned power to the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] of Rome, and offered to relinquish his own military supremacy over [[Egypt]]. Reportedly, the suggestion of Octavian's stepping down as consul led to rioting amongst the Plebeians in Rome. A compromise was reached between the Senate and Octavian's supporters, known as the First Settlement. Octavian was given proconsular authority over the Western half of the empire and [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] &amp;mdash; the provinces that, combined, contained almost 70% of the Roman legions.

The Senate also gave him the titles ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' and ''[[Princeps]]''. ''Augustus'' was a title of religious rather than political authority. In the mindset of contemporary religious beliefs, it would have cleverly symbolized a stamp of authority over humanity that went beyond any constitutional definition of his status. Additionally, after the harsh methods employed in consolidating his control, that the change in name would also serve to separate his benign reign as Augustus from his reign of terror as Octavian. ''Princeps'' translates to &quot;first-citizen&quot; or &quot;first-leader&quot;. It had been a title under the Republic for those who had served the state well; for example, [[Gnaeus Pompey]] had held the title.

In addition, and perhaps the most dangerous innovation, Augustus was granted the right to wear the Civic Crown of laurel and oak. This crown was usually held above the head of a Roman general during a [[Roman Triumph|Triumph]], with the individual holding the crown  charged to continually repeat, &quot;Remember, thou art mortal,&quot; to the triumphant general. The fact that not only was Augustus awarded this crown but awarded the right to actually wear it upon his head is perhaps the clearest indication of the creation of a [[monarchy]]. However, it must be noted that none of these titles, or the Civic Crown, granted Octavian any additional powers or authority; for all intents and purposes the new Augustus was simply a highly-honored Roman citizen, holding the consulship.

These actions were highly abnormal from the Roman Senate, but this was not the same body of patricians that had murdered Caesar. Both Antony and Octavian had purged the Senate of suspect elements and planted it with their loyal partisans. How free a hand the Senate had in these transactions, and what backroom deals were made, remain unknown.

===The Second Settlement===
In [[23 BC]] Augustus renounced the consulship, but retained his consular ''[[imperium]]'', leading to a second compromise between Augustus and the Senate known as the Second Settlement. Augustus was granted the power of a [[tribune]] (''tribunicia potestas''), though not the title, which allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before it, veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, preside over elections, and the right to speak first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman [[censor]]; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a [[census]] and determine the membership of the Senate. No Tribune of Rome ever had these powers, and there was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the Tribune and the Censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of Censor. Whether censorial powers were granted to Augustus as part of his ''tribunician'' authority, or he simply assumed these responsibilities, is still a matter of debate.

In addition to tribunician authority, Augustus was granted sole ''imperium'' within the city of Rome itself: all armed forces in the city, formerly under the control of the [[Prefect|Praefects]], were now under the sole authority of Augustus. Additionally, Augustus was granted ''imperium proconsulare maius'', or &quot;imperium over all the proconsuls&quot;, which translated to the right to interfere in any province in the Roman Empire and override the decisions of any governor.  With ''maius imperium,'' Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph as he was ostensibly the head of every Roman army. 

Many of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class. When in [[22 BC]] Augustus failed to stand for election as consul, fears arose once again that Augustus, seen as the great &quot;defender of the people&quot;, was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In [[22 BC|22]], [[21 BC|21]], and [[20 BC]] the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus. Finally in [[19 BC]] the Senate voted to allow Augustus to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate, sometimes known as the Third Settlement. This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was actually a consul, the importance was that he appeared as one before the people.

With these powers in mind, it must be understood that all forms of permanent and legal power within Rome officially lay with the Senate and the people; Augustus was given extraordinary powers, but only as a pronconsul and magistrate under the authority of the Senate. Augustus never presented himself as a king or autocrat, once again only allowing himself to be addressed by the title ''[[Princeps]]''. After the death of Lepidus in [[13 BC]] he additionally took up the position of [[pontifex maximus]].

Later Roman Emperors would generally be limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often, in order to display humility, newly appointed Emperors would often decline one or more of the honorifics given to Augustus. Just as often, as their reign progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had actually been granted by the Senate. The Civic Crown, consular insignia, and later the purple robes of a Triumphant general (''[[toga picta]]'') became the imperial insignia well into the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era, and were even adopted by many Germanic tribes invading the former Western empire as insignia of their right to rule.

==Reign==
Having gained power by means of great audacity, Augustus ruled with great prudence. In exchange for near absolute power, he gave Rome 40 years of civic peace and increasing prosperity, celebrated in history as the [[Pax Romana]], or ''Roman Peace''. 

===Military reforms===
He created Rome's first permanent army and navy and stationed the [[Roman legion|legions]] along the Empire's borders, where they could not meddle in politics. A special unit, the [[Praetorian Guard]], garrisoned Rome and protected the Emperor's person. He also reformed Rome's finance and tax systems.  Augustus channeled the enormous wealth brought in from the Empire to keeping the army happy with generous payments.

===Provincial reforms and imperial expansion===
The Roman Empire expanded enormously during the reign of Augustus. [[Cantabrian Wars|A war in the mountains of northern Hispania]] from [[26 BC]] to [[19 BC]] finally resulted in that territory's conquest. After [[Gauls|Gallic]] raids, the [[Alps|Alpine]] territories were conquered. Rome's borders were advanced to the natural frontier of the [[Danube]], and the province of [[Galatia]] was occupied. Further west, an attempt to advance into [[Germany]] ended with the defeat at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in [[9|AD 9]].  Thereafter Augustus and his successors accepted the [[Rhine]] as the Empire's permanent border. In the east, he satisfied himself with establishing Roman control over [[Armenia]] and the [[Transcaucasus]]. He left the [[Parthia|Parthian Empire]] alone maintaining generally good relations with them, arranging with them to return the standards lost to them by [[Crassus]], an event portrayed on the breastplate of the ''Prima Porta Augustus''.

====Britain====
The Res Gestae says he received two kings of Britain.  He considered [[Roman conquest of Britain#Aborted invasions|invasion]] on occasions but called it off.

====India====
There was an Indian in his retinue ([[Plutarch]], Life of Alexander, 69.9), and he claimed in the Raes Gestae to have received fealty from 'kings' of India.

===Civil reforms, innovations and entertainments in Rome===
He founded a ministry of [[transport]] that built an extensive network of roads &amp;mdash; enabling improved communication, trade, and [[mail]]. Augustus also founded the world's first [[fire brigade]], and created a regular [[Cohortes urbanae|police]] force for Rome.

He channeled the enormous wealth brought in from the Empire to keeping the army happy with generous payments, and keeping the citizens of Rome happy by staging magnificent games.  His use of games and special events to celebrate himself and his family cemented his popularity. 

===Building programmes in Rome===
He famously boasted that he &quot;found Rome [[brick]] and left it [[marble]]&quot; (though that hardly applied to the rickety flats of the [[Subura]]). 
He built 
*a new home or [[Curia]] for the Senate
*the [[Forum of Augustus]]
*new temples to 
**[[Apollo]] 
**Divine Julius
**[[Temple of Mars Ultor|Mars Ultor]] in his new [[Forum of Augustus|forum]]
*a shrine near the [[Circus Maximus]]. 

He restored
*the [[Capitoline Temple]] 
*the Theater of [[Pompey]] 
These are recorded as his projects, but his name was deliberately uncredited. 

He also encouraged others to carry out building projects, such as [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus (minor)]] and the [[Museo Nazionale Romano#Crypta Balbi|Crypta Balbi]].

===Economic policy===
Roman rulers understood little about [[economics]], and Augustus was no exception. Like all the Emperors, he overtaxed agriculture and spent the revenue on armies, temples, and games. However, wages and prices moved freely and allowed efficient markets to operate. When the Empire stopped expanding, and had no more loot coming in from conquests, its economy began to stagnate and eventually decline. The reign of Augustus is thus seen in some ways as the high point of Rome's power and prosperity. Augustus settled retired soldiers on the land in an effort to revive agriculture, but the capital remained dependent on grain imports from Egypt.

===Religious reforms===
Augustus also strongly supported worship of [[Roman gods]], especially [[Apollo]], and depicted Roman defeat of Egypt as Roman gods defeating [[Egyptian mythology|Egypt's]].

===Harking back to Rome's heritage===
He sponsored Virgil's [[Aeneid]] in the hopes that it would increase pride in Roman heritage (one of the titles he had refused in favour of Augustus was [[Romulus]], as a 'second founder' of Rome). 

===His own image===
[[Image:ac.augustus.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Bronze statue of Augustus, Archaeological Museum, Athens]]
[[Image:Statue-Augustus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The 'Prima Porta Augustus'([[Vatican Museums]])]]
He made a concerted campaign to have a standard version of his image reproduced throughout the empire as a focus of loyalty and, sometimes, [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)#From Julius Caesar to Hadrian|worship]].  Even when he was old, he was portrayed this way.  As a result, his image is the most recognizable of all the emperors in museums across the world, including

===Moral crusade===
Augustus also launched a morality crusade, promoting marriage, family, and childbirth while discouraging luxury, unrestrained sex (including [[prostitution]] and [[homosexuality]]), and adultery. It was largely unsuccessful (indeed, his own daughter and - possibly in connection to her - Ovid were both banished due to it.)

===Cultural patronage===
As a patron of the arts, Augustus showered favors on poets, artists, sculptors, and architects. His reign is considered the Golden Age of [[Roman literature]]. [[Horace]], [[Livy]], [[Ovid]], and [[Virgil]] flourished under his protection, but in return, they had to pay tribute to his genius and adhere to his standards. (Ovid was banished from Rome for violating Augustus's morality codes.) 

===Conclusion===
He eventually won over most of the Roman intellectual class, although many still pined in private for the Republic. His use of games and special events to celebrate himself and his family cemented his popularity. By the time Augustus died, a return to the old system was unimaginable. The only question was who would succeed him as sole ruler.

==Succession==

Augustus' control of power throughout the Empire was so absolute that it allowed him to name his successor, a custom that had been abandoned and derided in Rome since the foundation of the Republic. At first, indications pointed toward his sister's son [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]], who had been married to Augustus' daughter [[Julia Caesaris]]. However, Marcellus died of food poisoning in 23 BC. Reports of later historians that this poisoning, and other later deaths, were caused by Augustus' wife [[Livia Drusilla]] are inconclusive at best.

After the death of Marcellus, Augustus married his daughter to his right hand man, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Marcus Agrippa]]. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Lucius Caesar]], [[Vipsania Julia]], [[Agrippina the Elder]], and [[Postumus Agrippa]], so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Augustus' intent to make the first two children his heirs was apparent when he adopted them as his own children. Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage, [[Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus]] and [[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius]], after they had conquered a large portion of [[Germany]].

After Agrippa died in [[12 BC]], Livia's son Tiberius divorced his own wife and married Agrippa's widow. Tiberius shared in Augustus' tribune powers, but shortly thereafter went into retirement. After the early deaths of both Gaius and Lucius in [[4|AD 4]] and [[2|AD 2]] respectively, and the earlier death of his brother Drusus ([[9 BC]]), Tiberius was recalled to Rome, where he was adopted by Augustus.

On [[August 19]], [[14|AD 14]], Augustus died. Postumus Agrippa and Tiberius had been named co-heirs. However, Postumus had been banished, and was put to death around the same time. Who ordered his death is unknown, but the way was clear for Tiberius to assume the same powers that his stepfather had.

==Augustus's legacy==
[[Image:Hw-augustus.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Portrait drawing of Augustus: a detail of the famous statue found at Prima Porta]]
Augustus was deified soon after his death, and both his borrowed surname, Caesar, and his title ''Augustus'' became the permanent titles of the rulers of Rome for the next 400 years, and were still in use at [[Constantinople]] fourteen centuries after his death. In many languages, ''caesar'' became the word for ''emperor'', as in German (''[[Kaiser|Kaiser]]''), in Dutch (''keizer''), and in Russian (''[[Tsar|tsar]]''). The cult of the Divine Augustus continued until the state religion of the Empire was changed to [[Christianity]] in the [[4th century]]. Consequently, there are many excellent statues and busts of the first, and in some ways the greatest, of the emperors. Augustus' mausoleum also originally contained bronze pillars inscribed with a record of his life, the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]''.

Caesar Augustus is mentioned in Luke 2:1.

Many consider Augustus to be Rome's greatest emperor; his policies certainly extended the empire's life span and initiated the celebrated ''[[Pax Romana]]'' or ''Pax Augusta''. He was handsome, intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as Julius Caesar or Marc Antony. Nevertheless, his legacy proved more enduring.

The month of [[August]] (Latin ''Augustus'') is named after Augustus; until his time it was called [[Sextilis]] (the sixth month of the [[Roman calendar]]). Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's [[July]], but this is an invention of the 13th-century scholar [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]]. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see [[Julian calendar]]).

In looking back on the reign of Augustus and its legacy to the Roman world, its longevity should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success. People were born and reached middle age without knowing any form of government other than the Principate. Had Augustus died earlier (in 23 BC, for instance), matters may have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years. Augustus' own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor, and although every emperor adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, only a handful, such as [[Trajan]], earned genuine comparison with him. His reign laid the foundations of a regime that lasted for 250 years.

==Augustus in popular culture==

In the [[Home Box Office|HBO]] television series &quot;[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]&quot;, young Octavian is portrayed by [[Max Pirkis]].

Augustus was ranked #18 on [[Michael H. Hart]]'s [[The 100|list of the most influential figures in history]].

Augustus was portrayed in the famous [[BBC]] [[miniseries]] [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074006/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9SSBjbGF1ZGl1c3xmdD0xfG14PTIwfGxtPTUwMHxjbz0xfGh0bWw9MXxubT0x;fc=1;ft=21;fm=1 ''I, Claudius''] by [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000306/ Brian Blessed]. (1975)

Augustus was portrayed in the movie [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0340529/ ''Imperium: Augustus''] (part of the [[Imperium (movie)|Imperium]] movie series) by [[Peter O'Toole]].

The continent of [[Antarctica]] is located mostly south of the [[Antarctic Circle]]. Physically Antarctica is divided in two by mountains close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]].  The portion of the continent west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], since they correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich meridian]]. This usage has been regarded as [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] by some, and the alternative terms Lesser Antarctica and Greater Antarctica (respectively) are sometimes preferred. 

Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. There has been some concern about this [[ice sheet]], because there is a small chance that it will collapse. If it does, ocean levels would rise by a few metres in a very short period of time.

In some areas, the ice sheet rests on bedrock below sea level [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/aedc/bedmap/examples/bed10.gif].

==Statistics==

; Area:
:* Total: [[1 E13 m²|14 million sq km]]
:* Land: 14 million km² ([[1 E11 m²|280,000 sq km]] ice-free, 13.72 million km² ice-covered) (est.)
:* Note: Fifth-largest continent, following [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[North America]], and [[South America]], but larger than [[Australia]] and the subcontinent of [[Europe]]
; Land boundaries:
: None
; Coastline:
: [[1 E7 m|17,968 km]]
; Maritime claims:
: None
; Climate:
: Severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below freezing
; Terrain:
: About 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with average elevations [[1 E3 m|between 2,000 and 4,000 meters]]; mountain ranges up to 5,140 meters; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern [[Victoria Land]], [[Wilkes Land]], the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] area, and parts of [[Ross Island]] on [[McMurdo Sound]]; [[glacier]]s form ice shelves along about half of the coastline, and floating ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent.  The dry valleys of Antarctica are a particularly interesting region of Antarctica.  Due to extreme winds and lack of precipitation, this area is devoid of any snow and barren earth is visible.
; Elevation extremes:
:* Lowest point: [[Southern Ocean]] 0 [[metre|m]], although in some areas the bedrock under the ice sheet is below sea level.
:* Highest point: [[Vinson Massif]] 4,897 m ([[Ellsworth Mountains]])
; Natural resources:
: None presently exploited; [[iron]] ore, [[chromium]], [[copper]], [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[platinum]] and other minerals, and [[coal]] and [[hydrocarbons]] have been found in small, uncommercial quantities
; Land use:
:* Other: 100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%)
; Irrigated land:
