'''Andalusia''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Andalucía'') is a region of [[Spain]]. Andalusia is the most populated and second largest of the seventeen [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] that constitute Spain. Its capital is [[Seville]]. Andalusia is bounded on the north by [[Extremadura]] and [[Castile-La Mancha]], on the east by [[Murcia]], on the south Morroco and the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], and on the west by southern [[Portugal]]. 

The name Andalusia is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name &quot;Al Andalus&quot;, which referred to the parts of the Iberian peninsula which were under [[Muslim]] rule. The Islamic history of Muslim Spain can be found in the entry [[al-Andalus]]. [[Tartessos]], the capital of a once great and powerful Tartessian Civilization, was located in Andalusia, and was known in the Bible by the name of Tarsis. More information about this region can be found in the entry ''[[Hispania Baetica]]'', the name of the Roman province that corresponds to the region.   

Andalusian culture has been deeply marked by the eight centuries of Muslim rule over the region, which ended in 1492 with the conquest of Granada by the Catholic monarchs.  

The Spanish spoken in the [[Americas]] is largely descended from the [[Andalusian dialect]] of [[Spanish language|Castilian Spanish]] due to the role played by Seville as the gateway to Spain's American territories in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Andalusia is known for its moorish architecture. Famous monuments include the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], the [[Mezquita]] in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] and the [[Torre del Oro]] and [[Giralda]] towers in Seville and the [[Reales Alcázares]] in Seville. Archaeological remains include [[Medina Azahara]], near Córdoba and [[Itálica]], near Seville.

[[Andalusian cuisine]] is known for its use of [[fish]] and [[shellfish]], its [[dessert]]s, and its world-famous [[sherry]].

Andalusia is divided into eight [[provinces of Spain|provinces]] named after the capital cities of these provinces:

*[[Sevilla (province)|Sevilla]]
*[[Granada (province)|Granada]]
*[[Córdoba Province, Spain|Córdoba]]
*[[Cádiz (province)|Cádiz]]
*[[Málaga (province)|Málaga]]
*[[Huelva (province)|Huelva]]
*[[Jaén Province, Spain|Jaén]]
*[[Almería (province)|Almería]]

Other Andalusian towns are:
*[[Algeciras]], Cádiz
*[[Jerez]], Cádiz
*[[Marbella]], Málaga
*[[San Fernando]], Cádiz
*[[Dos Hermanas]], Sevilla
*[[Antequera]], Málaga
*[[Motril]], Granada
*[[Ronda]], [[Gaucín]], and the so-called &quot;''[[pueblos blancos]]'',&quot; Málaga


Andalusia is the home of [[flamenco]] music and of [[bullfighting]]. 

Day of Andalusia is celebrated on [[February 28]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{buddhism}}
'''Abhidharma''' ([[Sanskrit]]; [[Pāli]] ''Abhidhamma'') is a category of [[Buddhist]] scriptures that attempts to use Buddhist teachings to create a systematic, abstract description of all worldly phenomena.  The Abhidharma represents a generalization and reorganization of the doctrines presented piecemeal in the narrative ''[[sutra]]'' tradition.  

The literal translation of the term Abhidharma is unclear.  Two possibilities are most commonly given: 1) ''abhi''- higher or special + ''dharma''- teaching, philosophy, thus making Abhidharma the 'higher teachings', or 2) ''abhi'' - about + ''dharma'' of the teaching, translating it instead as 'about the teaching' or even 'meta-teaching'. 

==Origins==
Scholars generally believe that the Abhidharma emerged after the time of the Buddha, as the growth of monastic centers and support for the Buddhist [[sangha]] provided the resources and expertise necessary to systematically analyze the early teachings.  However, some scholars believe that rather than being wholly created by later thinkers, the Abhidharma represents an expansion of an early set of mnemonic lists and categories that were employed by early Buddhists to preserve the oral tradition.  

Numerous apparently independent Abhidharma traditions arose in [[India]], roughly during the period from the 2nd or 3rd Century BCE to the 5th Century CE.  The 7th Century Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] reportedly collected Abhidharma texts from seven different traditions.  In the modern era, only the Abhidharmas of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]] and the [[Theravada|Theravadins]] has survived intact, each consisting of seven books.  The Theravada Abhidharma, the Abhidhamma Pitaka (discussed below), is preserved in Pāli, while the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadin]] Abhidharma is preserved only in Chinese- the (likely [[Sanskrit]]) original texts having been lost.  A small number of other Abhidharma texts of unknown origin are preserved in translation in the Chinese canon.

Traditionally, Buddhists have been of the belief that the Abhidharma was not a later addition to the tradition, but rather represented the first, original teachings of the Buddha.  According to myth, shortly after his awakening the Buddha spent several days in meditation, during which he formulated the Abhidharma.  Later, he traveled to the heavenly realm and taught the Abhidharma to the divine beings that dwelled there, including his deceased mother [[Mahamaya]].  The contents of the teachings given in the heavenly realm were related to the monk [[Sariputa|Shariputra]], who passed them on after the Buddha's death.  The Abhidharma thus represents a pure and undiluted form of the teaching that was felt to be too difficult for most practitioners of the Buddha's time to grasp.  Instead, the Buddha taught by the method related in the various sutras, giving appropriate, immediately applicable teachings as each situation arose, rather than attempting to set forth the Abhidharma in their complexity and completion.

==Theravada Abhidharma==
The '''Abhidhamma Pitaka''' is the third [[pitaka]], or basket, of the [[Tipitaka]] (Pali; Sanskrit: Tripitaka), the [[Pali canon|canon]] of the [[Theravada]] school of [[Buddhism]].  It consists of seven sections as follow:

# [[Dhamma Sangani]] ('Enumeration of Factors') - Describes the fundamental phenomena or ''dhamma'' which constitute human experience.
# [[Vibhanga]] ('Analysis') - An exposition of the analysis in the Dhamma Sangani in the form of a [[catechism]].
# [[Kathavatthu|Katha Vatthu]] ('Points of Controversy') - A collection of orthodox answers to questions about monastic practice, compiled by [[Moggaliputta Tissa]] after the Buddhist Council sponsored by King [[Ashoka]] in the 3rd Century BCE.
# [[Puggala Pannatti]] ('Descriptions of Individuals') - An enumeration of the qualities of certain different 'personality types'.  These types were believed to be useful in formulating teachings that an individual would respond to positively.
# [[Dhatu Katha]] ('Discussion of Elements') - Similar content to the Vibhanga, formulated as sets of questions and answers.
# [[Yamaka]] ('The Pairs') - A repetition of much of the contents of the Vibhanga, Dhatu Katha, and Katha Vatthu.
# [[Patthana]] ('Foundational Conditions' ''or'' 'Relations') - The laws of interaction by which the ''dhamma'' described in the Dhamma Sangani operate

These have all been published in romanized [[Pāli|Pali]] by the [[Pali Text Society]], and have been translated into [[English language|English]] as well. [[Scholar]]s date these works from about [[400 BC]] to about [[250 BC]], the first being the oldest and the third the latest of the seven.  Additional post-canonical texts were composed in the following centuries which attempted to further clarify the analysis presented in the Abhidhamma texts.  The best known such texts are the [[Visuddhimagga]] of [[Buddhaghosa]] and the [[Abhidhammāvatāra]] of [[Buddhadatta]].

Early Western translators of the Pāli canon found the Abhidhamma Pitaka to be the least interesting of the three sections of the [[Tipitaka]], and as a result this important aspect of Buddhist philosophy was little studied in the West until the later half of the 20th Century.  [[Caroline Rhys Davids]], a Pāli scholar and the wife of [[Pali Text Society]] founder [[T.W. Rhys Davids]], famously described the ten chapters of the Yamaka as &quot;ten valleys of dry bones&quot;.  Interest in the Abhidhamma has grown in the West as better scholarship on Buddhist philosophy has gradually revealed more information about its origins and significance.

Within the Theravada tradition, the prominence of the Abhidhamma has varied considerably from country to country, with mainland Southeast Asia placing the least emphasis on the study of the Abhidhamma and [[Sri Lanka]] the most.

== Sarvastivada Abhidharma ==

The Sarvastivada Abhidharma also consists of seven texts.  However, comparison of the content of the Sarvastivada texts with that of the Theravada Abhidhamma reveals that it is unlikely that this indicates that one textual tradition originated from the other.  In particular, the Theravada Abhidharma contains two texts (the ''Katha Vatthu'' and ''Puggala Pannatti'') that seem entirely out of place in an Abhidharma collection; the reason for their conclusion, and the resulting parity in number of Theravada and Sarvastivada texts is a matter for conjecture unlikely to be resolved.  

The texts of the Sarvastivadin Abhidharma are:

# [[Sangītiparyāya]] ('Discourses on Sangīti')
# [[Dharmaskandha]] ('Aggregation of Factors')
# [[Prajñaptiśāstra]] ('Treatise on Designations')
# [[Dhātukāya]] ('Body of Elements')
# [[Vijñānakāya]] ('Body of Perceptual Consciousness')
# [[Prakaranapāda]] ('Exposition')
# [[Jñānaprasthāna]] ('Foundations of Knowledge')

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abhorrers''', the name given in [[1679]] to the persons who expressed their abhorrence at the action of those who had signed petitions urging King [[Charles II of England]] to assemble [[English Parliament|Parliament]].

Feeling against [[Roman Catholic]]s, and especially against James, Duke of York, was running strongly; the [[Exclusion Bill]] had been passed by the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]], and the popularity of [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth]], was very great.

To prevent this bill from passing into law, Charles had dissolved parliament in [[July]] [[1679]], and in the following October had [[prorogue]]d its successor without allowing it to meet.  He was then deluged with petitions urging him to call it together, and this agitation was opposed by Sir [[George Jeffreys]] and [[Francis Wythens]], who presented addresses expressing ''abhorrence'' of the ''Petitioners,'' and thus initiated the movement of the abhorrers, who supported the action of the king. &quot;The frolic went all over [[England]],&quot; says [[Roger North]]; and the addresses of the Abhorrers which reached the king from all parts of the country formed a counterblast to those of the [[Petitioner]]s.  It is said that the terms [[Whig]] and [[Tory]] were first applied to English political parties in consequence of this dispute.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abiathar ''' (Heb. Ebyathar, ''the [divine] father is pre-eminent''), in the [[Bible]], son of [[Achimelech]] or Ahijah, priest at [[Nob]], the fourth in descent from [[Eli]]. The only one of the priests to escape from Saul's massacre, he fled to David at Keilah, taking with him the ephod (1 Sam. xxii. 20 f., xxiii. 6, 9). He was of great service to David, especially at the time of the rebellion of [[Absalom]] (2 Sam. xv. 24, 29, 35, xx. 25). In 1 Kings iv. 4 Zadok and Abiathar are found acting together as priests under Solomon.  In 1 Kings i. 7, 19, 25, however, Abiathar appears as a supporter of Adonijah, and in ii. 22 and 26 it is said that he was deposed by Solomon and banished to Anathoth.  In 2 Sam. viii. 17 ''Abiathar, the son of [[Achimelech]]'' should be read, with the Syriac, for ''Achimelech, the son of Abiathar.'' For a similar confusion see [[Gospel of Mark]] ii. 26.

When his father was slain with the priests of Nob, he escaped, and bearing with him the [[ephod]], he joined David, who was then in the cave of [[Adullam]] (1 Sam. 22:20-23; 23:6). He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader (1 Sam. 30:7). 

When David ascended the throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed high priest (1 Chr. 15:11; 1 Kings 2:26) and the &quot;king's companion&quot; (1 Chr. 27:34). Meanwhile Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made high priest. 

These appointments continued in force till the end of David's reign (1 Kings 4:4). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar (1 Sam. 2:30-36; 1 Kings 1:19; 2:26, 27). 

Zadok now became sole high priest. In Mark 2:26, reference is made to an occurrence in &quot;the days of Abiathar the high priest.&quot; But from 1 Sam. 22, we learn explicitly that this event took place when Achimelech, the father of Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy is satisfactorily explained by interpreting the words in Mark as referring to the life-time of Abiathar, and not to the term of his holding the office of high priest. It is not implied in Mark that he was actual high priest at the time referred to. Others, however, think that the loaves belonged to Abiathar, who was at that time (Lev. 24:9) a priest, and that he either himself gave them to David, or persuaded his father to give them.

She is described as the wife of [[Nabal|Nabal the Carmelite]], whose life she saves when David wishes to kill him. On his death she became the 3rd wife of [[David]] ({{bibleverse|Samuel|1|25|HE}}).  By her David had a son, whose name appears in the Hebrew of 2 Samuel 3:3 as Chileab, in the [[Septuagint]] as Daluyah, and in {{bibleverse|Chronicles|1|3:1|HE}} as [[Daniel (son of David)|Daniel]].

* The name Abigail was also borne by a sister of David ({{bibleverse|Samuel|2|17:25|HE}}; {{bibleverse|Chronicles|1|2:16|HE}} and following).  
* From the former (self-styled ''handmaid'' {{bibleverse|Samuel|1|25:25|HE}} and following) is derived the colloquial use of the term for a waiting-woman (cf. Abigail, the ''waiting gentlewoman,'' in [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''Scornful Lady'').

'''Azad Jammu and Kashmir''' ([[Urdu]]: '''آزاد کشمیر'''), is part of the [[Pakistan]]i-administered part of the former princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], along with the [[Northern Areas, Pakistan|Northern Areas]]. The name Azad Kashmir means &quot;Free Kashmir&quot; in [[Urdu]]. [[India]] does not recognize Azad Kashmir as a part of [[Pakistan]] and refers to the region encompassing Azad Kashmir and the [[Northern Areas, Pakistan|Northern Areas]] as [[Pakistan Occupied Kashmir]](POK). It covers an area of 13,300 [[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]] (5,135 [[square mile|mi&amp;sup2;]]), with its capital at [[Muzaffarabad]], and has an estimated population of over three million people. 

==General Information and Recent History==

The region is extremely mountainous and includes a significant part of the [[Himalaya]]s, but does not include [[Nanga Parbat]], the world's seventh highest mountain peak, which falls within the &quot;[[Northern Areas, Pakistan|Northern Areas]]&quot;.

After the partition of India in 1947 and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]], Pakistan gained administrative rights to a portion of Kashmir as per a cease-fire agreement. Pakistan divided the region into three administrative sub-regions:

#Azad Kashmir, 250 miles (400 km) in length with the width varying from 10 to 40 miles (15 to 65 km), 13,300 km&amp;sup2; (5,135 mi&amp;sup2;), 
# [[Northern_Areas, Pakistan|Northern Areas]], a much larger area, 72,496 km&amp;sup2; (27,991 mi&amp;sup2;), incorporated into Pakistan and administered as a de facto dependency, and
#A small part, the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]], of the Northern Areas that was ceded to [[China]] by Pakistan in 1963.

Parts of Azad Kashmir wer lost to Indian forces in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 war]] before were returned by India as part of the [[Simla Accord]], in 1972.

Azad Kashmir is nominally [[autonomous]], with its own elected [[President]], [[Prime Minister]], Legislature, High Court etc.

==Demography==

Although a proper [[census]] has not been taken in recent years, the best estimates conclude that the Azad Kashmir region has approximately 3.1 million inhabitants.

The population of Azad Kashmir includes [[Kashmiri]]s and also comprises [[Hindko]]-speaking [[Pathans]], the [[Potwari]] (whose language includes the Mirpuri dialect) and the nomadic [[Gujjars]], who largely inhabit the upper hills and slopes.  Tribes or clans (biraderi) are important for some groups in the region and include: the [[Sudhan]]([[Sadozai]]) , [[Rajput]]s, Mirpuri [[Jat (people)|Jats]], and [[Gujjars]].

The Hindko and Potwari languages are both related to Punjabi, but have distinct separate features. Potwari is spoken in the [[United Kingdom]] by the Mirpuri community; Mirpuri is a local dialect of Potwari spoken in and around the [[Mirpur]] and [[Kotli]] districts.  About 700,000 Mirpuris live in the United Kingdom today.

Azad Kashmir is predominantly [[Muslim]], although over 100,000 Hindus and Sikhs lived there until 1947.

== Geography ==
Azad Kashmir is a more mountainous and cold region than the rest of Kashmir. It boasts some of the most scenic mountain tops and river valleys. {{sect-stub}}

[[Image:Kannurfort1.JPG|thumb|top|300px|A view of [[Arabian Sea]] from [[St. Angelo's Fort]] in [[Kannur]] district of [[Kerala]], [[south India]]]]

The '''Arabian [[Sea]]''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: بحر العرب; [[Arabic transliteration|transliterated]]: Bahr al-'Arab, [[Latin]]: ''Mare Erythraeum'') is the part of the [[Indian Ocean]] bounded on the east by [[India]], on the north by [[Baluchistan]] and [[Sind]] provinces of [[Pakistan]] and part of the southern Persian littoral, on the west by [[Arabian Peninsula]], on the south, approximately, by a line between [[Cape Guardafui]], the north-east point of [[Somalia]], and [[Kanyakumari]] (Cape Comorin) in [[India]]. It was known as the ''Sindhu Sagar'' to Indians in the [[Vedic period]] of their history.

It has two important branches &amp;mdash; the Gulf of Aden in the southwest, connecting with the Red Sea through the strait of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]]; and the [[Gulf of Oman]] to the northwest, connecting with the [[Persian Gulf]]. Besides these larger ramifications, there are the gulfs of [[Gulf of Cambay|Cambay]] and [[Gulf of Kutch|Kutch]] on the Indian coast. Its islands are few, the chief being [[Socotra]], off the African, and the [[Laccadives]], off the Indian coast.

Ocean trade routes have crossed the Arabian Sea since ancient times, linking the [[Near East]] with [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[China]]. Historically, sailors in a type of ship called a [[dhow]] used the seasonal [[Monsoon]] winds to cross the sea. The sea forms part of the chief shipping route between Europe and India via the [[Suez Canal]], which links the Red Sea with the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

The maximum width of the Arabian Sea is approximately 2,400 km, and its maximum depth is 4,652 metres, in the Arabian Basin approximately at the same latitude as the southernmost tip of India. The [[Indus River]], also known as the Sindhu river, is the largest river flowing directly into this sea; others include the [[Narmada River|Narmada]], [[Tapti River|Tapti]], [[Mahi River|Mahi]], and the numerous [[List of rivers in Kerala|rivers of Kerala]] in India. The Arabian Sea coast of central India is known as the [[Konkan Coast]], and that of southern India is known as the [[Malabar Coast]].

The countries with coastlines on the Arabian Sea are [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Oman]], [[Pakistan]], [[Yemen]], [[Somalia]] and the [[Maldives]].

Cities on the coast include [[Mumbai]] (Bombay), [[Surat]], [[Mangalore]], and [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] in India, [[Karachi]] and [[Gwadar]] in Pakistan, and [[Aden]] in Yemen.

Famous beaches on the coast include
* beaches of [[Karachi]], [[Main Khye]]
* the beaches of [[Goa]]
* [[Juhu#Juhu_Beach|Juhu]] Beach, [[Mumbai]]
* [[Kovalam]] beach in [[Kerala]]

'''Aria Giovanni''' (born [[November 3]], [[1977]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]) is the [[stage name]] of a [[model (person)|model]] and a [[pornographic actress|soft pornographic film actress]] who was ''[[Penthouse magazine|Penthouse]]'' [[Penthouse Pet|Pet]] for the month of September 2000.

==Biography==
Although Giovanni was born in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], by high school she was living in nearby [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. Growing up Aria recounts that she was quite shy, with only one friend in high school, but that she did very well in her classes. According to her website, she did so well that she was able to graduate and head to college by the age of 16.

She attended college for several years, waitressing and tutoring in science and math on the side, when she decided modelling might be an easier way to make good money. She started answering newspaper ads in [[October]], [[1999]], and soon began appearing on various [[amateur pornography]] [[website]]s such as Amateur Pink, Busty Amateurs, and Seductive Amateurs.

In 2000, [[Aimee Sweet]] introduced Giovanni to [[glamour photography|glamour photographer]] [[Suze Randall]], who in late May of that year shot photos of Giovanni which appeared in the September issue of ''Penthouse'' magazine.

At the same time, she also appeared on the web site [[Bomis]], posing clothed for a [[Ferrari]] giveaway contest.

In 2001, she played Monica Snatch in the movie ''Survivors Exposed'', a parody of the ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'' [[television]] series.

Giovanni has also appeared in [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[fetish]] and artistic photography. She has gained particular respect for being among relatively few large-chested models working in the field who have not undergone [[cosmetic surgery]].

Giovanni has worked extensively with [[Andrew Blake]], appearing in ''Girlfriends'', ''Aria'', ''Blonds &amp; Brunettes'', ''Justine'', ''Adriana'', and ''Naked Diva''. She has appeared in both softcore and hardcore pornographic movies, although most of her lesbian scenes involve purely implied sexual contact.

She is currently married to [[John5|John Lowery]] (better known as John5), formerly of the band [[Marilyn Manson]].

==Trivia==
*Penthouse Pet of the month (September 2000)
*Posed for the premiere issue of Mystique Magazine
*At sixteen she began dating a man. This lasted for five years; she married him at twenty-one but divorced him five weeks later.

==Quotes==
&quot;In high school I was an ugly duckling. I had big breasts, an exotic voluptuous look and was so pathetically shy I had hardly any friends.&quot;

&quot;Finding clothes that would fit me was a real problem, too. Dresses that fitted my breasts hung on the rest of me like an empty sack. My tits burst out of dresses that fitted my waist. At least I didn't have the problem of finding a prom dress — no one asked me!&quot;

==Notable TV guest appearances==
* ''[[Shipmates]]'' playing herself, [[November 16]], [[2001]]
* ''[[Howard Stern]]'' playing herself, [[October 30]] [[2002]]
* ''[[Wild On!]]'' playing herself in episode: &quot;Wild on Hollywood Nights&quot; 2003
* ''[[Rock Theatre Television]]'' playing herself in episode: &quot;DragonCon 2003&quot; (episode # 1.2) [[November 2]], [[2003]]

'''Aspartame''' is the name for an artificial, non-[[carbohydrate]] [[sweetener]], ''aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester''; i.e., the methyl [[ester]] of the [[dipeptide]] of the [[amino acid]]s [[aspartic acid]] and [[phenylalanine]].  It is marketed under a number of trademark names, such as '''''[[NutraSweet]]''''', [[Equal (sweetener)|Equal]], and [[Canderel]], and is an ingredient of approximately 5,000 consumer foods and beverages sold worldwide.  It is commonly used in diet [[soft drink]]s, and is often provided as a table condiment. It is also used in some brands of chewable vitamin supplements. However, aspartame is not always suitable for baking, because it often breaks down when heated and loses much of its sweetness. In the European Union, it is also known under the [[E number]] (additive code) '''E951'''. Aspartame is also one of the sugar substitutes used by [[diabetes mellitus|diabetics]]. 

Aspartame has been the subject of a vigorous public controversy regarding its safety and the circumstances around its approval.  It is well-known that aspartame contains the naturally-occurring amino acid [[phenylalanine]], which is a health hazard to the few people born with [[phenylketonuria]], a genetic inability to process phenylalanine.  A few studies have also recommended further investigation into possible connections between aspartame and diseases such as [[brain tumor]]s, [[lesion|brain lesions]], and [[lymphoma]], but no large-scale studies have been conducted.  These possibilities, combined with notable conflicts of interest in the approval process, have engendered vocal activism regarding the legitimate risks of aspartame, as well as some less credible theories.

== Chemistry ==
Aspartame is the [[methyl]] [[ester]] of the [[dipeptide]] of the natural [[amino acid]]s L-[[aspartic acid]] and L-[[phenylalanine]]. Under strongly-[[acid]]ic or -[[Base (chemistry)|alkaline]] conditions, aspartame first generates [[methanol]] by [[hydrolysis]]. Under more severe conditions, the [[peptide bond]]s are also [[hydrolyzed]], resulting in the free amino acids.

== Properties and use ==

Aspartame's attractiveness as a sweetener comes from the fact that it is approximately 180 times sweeter than [[sugar]] in typical concentrations without the high energy value of sugar.  While aspartame, like other peptides, has a caloric value of 4 kilocalories (17 kilojoules) per gram, the quantity of aspartame needed to produce a sweet taste is so small that its caloric contribution is negligible, which makes it a popular sweetener for those trying to avoid calories from sugar.  The taste of aspartame is not identical to &lt;!--parallelism, PLEASE: we are NOT comparing the taste of aspartame to sugar, but the taste of aspartame to the TASTE of sugar--&gt;that of sugar: aspartame's sweetness has a slower onset and longer duration than sugar's, and some consumers find it unappealing.  Blends of aspartame with [[acesulfame potassium]] are purported to have a more sugar-like taste, and to be more potent than either sweetener used alone.

Like many other [[peptide]]s, aspartame may [[hydrolyze]] (break down) into its constituent amino acids under conditions of elevated temperature (in the case of aspartame, 86 °C) or high [[pH]].  This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener, and prone to degradation in high-pH products requiring a long shelf life.   Aspartame's stability under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in [[fat]]s or in [[maltodextrin]].  Aspartame's stability when dissolved in water depends markedly on [[pH]].  At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its [[half-life]] is nearly 300 days.  At pH 7, however, its half-life is only a few days.  Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where aspartame is reasonably stable.  In products that may require a longer shelf life, such as syrups for [[soda fountain|fountain beverages]], aspartame is sometimes blended with a more stable sweetener, such as [[saccharin]].

In products such as powdered beverages, aspartame's amino group can undergo a [[Maillard reaction]] with the [[aldehyde]] groups present in certain [[aroma compound]]s.  The ensuing loss of both flavor and sweetness can be prevented by protecting the aldehyde as an [[acetal]].

== Discovery and approval ==
Aspartame was discovered in [[1965]] by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for [[Searle (company)|G.D. Searle &amp; Company]]. Schlatter had synthesized aspartame in the course of producing an anti-[[ulcer]] drug candidate.  He discovered its sweet taste serendipitously when he licked his finger, which had accidentally become contaminated with aspartame.

Initial safety testing suggested that aspartame might cause brain tumors in rats; as a result, the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) did not approve its use as a food additive in the [[United States]] for several years. In [[1980]], the FDA convened a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) consisting of independent advisors charged with examining the purported relationship between aspartame and [[brain cancer]]. The PBOI concluded that the risk of mental retardation and brain damage from aspartame ingestion was negligable, but it recommended against approving aspartame at that time, citing unanswered questions about possible brain cancer potential.  In [[1981]], U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], prompted by U.S. Vice-President [[George H. W. Bush]], released the then current FDA commissioner, Jere E. Goyan, Ph.D., and appointed [[Arthur Hull Hayes]] as FDA commissioner. Arthur Hull Hayes, at the urging of Donald Rumsfeld and George Bush, approved aspartame quickly.  Hayes approved aspartame for use in dry goods [http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00772.html]. In [[1983]] the FDA further approved aspartame for use in carbonated beverages, and the FDA commissioner, Arthur Hull Hayes ended up leaving the FDA to work directly for Donald Rumsfed under Searle. The FDA approved aspartame for use in other beverages, baked goods, and confections in [[1993]]. In [[1996]], the FDA removed all restrictions from aspartame allowing it to be used in all foods. 

In [[1985]], G.D. Searle was purchased by [[Monsanto]].  In this acquisition, Searle's aspartame business became a separate Monsanto subsidiary, the [[NutraSweet|NutraSweet Company]].  The U.S. [[patent]] on aspartame expired in [[1992]], and the aspartame market is now hotly contested between the NutraSweet Company and other manufacturers such as [[Ajinomoto]], Merisant and the Holland Sweetener Company.

== Health risks controversy ==
While it is well-known that aspartame contains [[phenylalanine]] and is unsafe for those born with [[phenylketonuria]], some believe that aspartame can be implicated in other public health issues. Some of these contentions are backed by reputable scientific research, while others depend heavily on anecdotal evidence and layman's interpretations of chemistry.

&lt;!-- Put this section before components because it seems better to start with more
general information on potential health effects as opposed to getting right into
the potential health effects of the components --&gt;
The FDA receives more complaints related to aspartame than any other food additive. Concerns about aspartame frequently revolve around symptoms and health conditions that are allegedly caused by the sweetener. The 92 health effects reported to the FDA are:
[[abdominal pain]],
[[anxiety attack]]s,
[[arthritis]],
[[asthma]],
asthmatic reactions,
bloating/[[edema]],
blood sugar control problems ([[hypoglycemia]] or [[hyperglycemia]]),
[[brain cancer]] (Pre-approval studies in animals),
breathing difficulties,
burning eyes or throat,
burning [[urination]],
inability to think clearly,
[[chest pain]]s,
[[chronic cough]],

Questions have been raised about [[brain cancer]], [[lymphoma]], and [[genotoxic]] effects such as [[DNA]]-protein crosslinks, but these questions are primarily not based on reported case histories.

The sources for reported symptoms and health conditions that have raised questions include:

# Reports and analysis of case histories in scientific journals and at medical conferences
# Symptoms reported to the FDA and other governmental agencies
# Symptoms reported to non-governmental organizations, researchers, and physicians
# Reports of symptoms and health conditions in the media
# Self-reported cases on the Internet.

There is a significant debate in the scientific and medical community as to whether these symptoms are or are not caused by short-term or long-term exposure to aspartame. Some human and animal studies have found adverse effects and some have found no adverse effects.

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=9230890&amp;query_hl=15]
It is not only the results of the research that have been questioned, but the design of the research that led to specific outcomes. For example, in human research of aspartame, the aspartame is usually provided in slow-dissolving capsules. But the biochemical changes from ingesting aspartame in slow-dissolving capsules are many times smaller than &lt;!--parallelism, PLEASE--&gt;those from ingesting aspartame dissolved in liquids (such as carbonated beverages).  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=3574137&amp;query_hl=18]
Therefore, the amount of aspartame used in most human studies is equivalent to a much smaller &quot;real-world&quot; amount. Other questions that have been raised about aspartame research involve the length of the studies, the number of test subjects, conflict of interest issues, and improper testing procedures. 

Since the FDA approved aspartame for consumption in 1981, some researchers have suggested that a rise in brain tumor rates in the United States may be at least partially related to the increasing availability and consumption of aspartame.  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=8939194&amp;dopt=Abstract]  In 2005, researchers with the (Ramazzini) Cancer Research Centre in [[Italy]] reported that aspartame &quot;causes a dose-related statistically significant increase in [[lymphoma]]s and [[leukaemia]]s in female [[rats]] at dose levels very near those to which humans can be exposed.&quot;  However, the report also found that &quot;no statistically significant increase in malignant brain tumors was observed.&quot; [http://www.ramazzini.it/fondazione/docs/AspartameGEO2005.pdf]  The study, published in the ''European Journal of Oncology'', raises concerns about the levels of aspartame exposure.

&lt;!-- Replace NPOV discussion of only 1 component. NPOV and verifiability
text  for the 4 items below is in the discussion section. --&gt;
There are four chemical components of aspartame that scientists 
and physicians have debated as to whether they are causing
or can cause adverse health effects:

=== Methanol ===
Scientists agree that approximately 10% of aspartame (by weight) is broken down into [[methanol]] in the small intestine. Most of the methanol is absorbed and quickly converted  into [[formaldehyde]]. Some scientists believe that the methanol cannot be a problem because: a) there is not enough methanol absorbed to cause toxicity, b) methanol and formaldehyde are already a by-product of human metabolism, and c) there is more methanol in some alcoholic beverages and fruit juices than is derived from aspartame ingestion.
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12180494&amp;query_hl=2]
[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T8P-47PNYWC-85&amp;_user=10&amp;_handle=V-WA-A-W-D-MsSAYVW-UUA-U-AABUAWEZDB-AAWDDAUVDB-BZUWEDBWC-D-U&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F1994&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=%23toc%235092%231994%23999949993%23379195!&amp;_cdi=5092&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=f9e7576a5adb6c95153f396596cc0cff]

Other scientists believe a) fruit juices and alcoholic beverages always
contain protective chemicals such as [[ethanol]] that block conversion of methanol 
into formaldehyde, but aspartame contains no protective factors, b) the levels of methanol and particularly formaldehyde have been proven to cause chronic toxicity in humans, and c) the low levels of methanol and formaldehyde in human metabolism are 
tightly-controlled such that significant increases from aspartame ingestion are not safe.
[http://www.dorway.com/monte84.html], [http://www.holisticmed.com/aspartame/abuse/methanol.html]

In 1998, a team of scientists in Spain conducted an experiment
on rodents to indirectly measure the levels of formaldehyde
adducts in the organs after ingestion of
aspartame. They did this by [[radiolabeling]] the methanol portion
of aspartame. The scientists concluded that formaldehyde 
bound to [[protein]] and [[DNA]] accumulated in the brain, liver, kidneys and other tissues
after ingestion of either 20 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg of aspartame. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=9714421&amp;query_hl=7] 
However, it has been argued by Tephly that these scientists 
were not directly measuring formaldehyde, but simply 
measuring levels of some by-product of the methanol from 
aspartame.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12180494&amp;query_hl=15]
Tephly believes that the by-product was not 
formaldehyde. The researchers have stated that the 
data in the experiment has proven it was formaldehyde. [http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/aspartameNM/message/864]

=== Phenylalanine ===
[[Phenylalanine]] is an amino acid commonly found in foods. Approximately 50% of 
aspartame (by weight) is broken down into phenylalanine. Because aspartame is metabolized and absorbed very quickly (unlike phenylalanine-containing proteins in foods), it is known that aspartame could spike [[blood plasma]] levels of phenylalanine. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=3574137&amp;query_hl=11],  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=1946186&amp;query_hl=12] 
The debate centers on whether a significant
spike in blood plasma phenylalanine occurs at typical aspartame
ingestion levels, whether a sudden influx of phenylalanine
into the bloodstream adversely affects uptake of other amino acids
into the brain and the production of [[neurotransmitter]]s
(since phenylalanine competes with other Large Neutral Amino
Acids (LNAAs) for entry into the brain at the [[blood brain barrier]]), 
and whether a significant rise in phenylalanine levels would be concentrated
in the brain of fetuses and be potentially [[neurotoxic]].

Based on case histories from aspartame users, measuring levels of neurotransmitters in the brains of animals and measuring the potential of aspartame to cause seizures in animals, some scientists believe that aspartame may affect neurotransmitter production. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=3319565&amp;query_hl=18], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=3352866&amp;query_hl=21], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=2442082&amp;query_hl=24]
They believe that even a moderate spike in blood plasma phenylalanine
levels from typical ingestion may have adverse consequences in long-term
use. They are especially concerned that the phenylalanine can be concentrated
in fetal brains to a potentially neurotoxic level. [http://www.dorway.com/elsas.txt], [http://www.trustedhands.com/content/aspartamepregnancy.html] Other scientists
believe that rise in blood plasma phenylalanine is negligible in typical
use of aspartame [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=2215254&amp;query_hl=28]
and their studies show no significant
effects on neurotransmitter levels in the brain or changes in seizure
thresholds. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=2013754&amp;query_hl=16], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=2379890&amp;query_hl=28], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=2470165&amp;query_hl=28]
In addition, they say that proven adverse effects of 
phenylalanine on fetuses has only been seen when blood phenylalanine 
levels stay at high levels as opposed to occasionally being spiked to 
high levels. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=3351801&amp;query_hl=40]

=== Aspartic acid ===
[[Aspartic acid]] is an amino acid commonly found in foods.  Approximately 40% of aspartame (by mass) is broken down into aspartic acid. Because aspartame is 
metabolized and absorbed very quickly (unlike aspartic acid-containing proteins in foods), it is known that aspartame could spike blood plasma levels of aspartate. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=3574137&amp;query_hl=11], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=3670074&amp;query_hl=2] 
Aspartic acid is in a class of chemicals known as [[excitotoxin]]s. Abnormally high levels of excitotoxins
have been shown in hundreds of animals studies to cause damage to areas of the brain unprotected by the 
blood-brain barrier and a variety of chronic diseases arising out of this neurotoxicity. [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0898597358],  [http://www.holisticmed.com/msg/msg-review.txt]
The debate amongst scientists has
been raging since the early 1970's, when Dr. John Olney found that high levels of aspartic acid
caused damage to the brains of infant mice [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=5464249&amp;query_hl=11]. 
Dr. Olney and consumer attorney, James Turner filed
a protest with the FDA to block the approval of aspartame. The debate is complex and has focused
on several areas: a) whether the increase in plasma aspartate levels from typical ingestion levels of aspartame is enough to cause neurotoxicity in one dose or over time b) whether humans are susceptible to the neurotoxicity from aspartic acid seen in some animal experiments, c) whether
aspartic acid increases the toxicity of formaldehyde, d) whether neurotoxicity from excitotoxins
should consider the combined effect of aspartic acid and other excitotoxins such as 
[[glutamic acid]] from [[monosodium glutamate]]. The Neuroscientists at a meeting of the Society for Neuroscience had a split of opinion on the issues related to neurotoxic effects from excitotoxic amino acids found in some additives such as aspartame. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=2294587&amp;query_hl=8]

Some scientists believe that humans and other primates are not as susceptible to excitotoxins as 
rodents and therefore there is little concern with aspartic acid from aspartame. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=810365&amp;query_hl=16], 
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=827619&amp;query_hl=22] 
While they agree that the combined
effects of all food-based excitotoxins should be considered [http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/gw/Cmd?linkVars=SessionID%3D05092315500130003261%26BROWSER_STATE%3DGMResults%26ORBagentPort%3D14610%26GM2K_FORM%3DGMResults%26LAST_HIDDEN_TIMESTAMP%3D1127534667706%26UserSearchText%3Dstegink%2Bfiler%26sb_action%3DExpand%2BItem%2B%253A%2B1%26HIDDEN_TIMESTAMP%3D1127534686370],
their measurements of the blood
plasma levels of aspartic acid after ingestion of aspartame and monosodium glutamate 
demonstrate that there is not a cause for concern. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=903828&amp;query_hl=45], 
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=2909831&amp;query_hl=48]
Other scientists feel that primates are susceptible to excitotoxic damage [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=4626680&amp;query_hl=18]
and that humans concentrate excitotoxins in the blood more than other animals. [http://www.holisticmed.com/aspartame/abuse/stegink.jpg] 
Based on these findings, they feel that humans are approximately 5-6 times more susceptible to the effects of excitotoxins than are rodents. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=6152304&amp;query_hl=53] While they agree that typical use of aspartame does not spike
aspartic acid to extremely high levels in adults, they are particularly concerned with potential
effects in infants and young children [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=1982368&amp;query_hl=41], 
the potential long-term neurodegenerative effects of 
small-to-moderate spikes on plasma excitotoxin levels [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=7854587&amp;query_hl=41], 
and the potential dangers of combining formaldehyde
exposure from aspartame with excitotoxins given that chronic methanol exposure increases excitoxin levels in susceptible
areas of the brain
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12490131&amp;query_hl=37],
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12112376&amp;query_hl=46]
and that excitotoxins may potentiate formaldehyde damage.  [http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/aspartameNM/message/1173]

=== Aspartylphenylalanine diketopiperazine ===
This type of [[diketopiperazine]] (DKP) is created in 
products as aspartame breaks down over time. For example, researchers found that&lt;!--dependent clause: comma needed--&gt;, 6 months after
aspartame was put into carbonated beverages, 25% of the aspartame had been converted to DKP.
[http://pubs3.acs.org/acs/journals/archive_lookup?in_manuscript_number=jf00064a043]
Concern amongst some scientists has been expressed that this form of DKP would undergo a
[[nitrosation]] process in the stomach producing a type of chemical that could cause brain tumors.
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8939194&amp;query_hl=2], 
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8505016&amp;query_hl=5]
Other scientists feel that the nitrosation of aspartame or the DKP in the stomach would not
produce a chemical that would cause brain tumors. In addition, only a minuscule amount of the
nitrosated chemical would be produced. 
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8990134&amp;query_hl=7]
There are very few human studies on the effects
of this form of DKP. However, a (one-day) exposure study showed that the DKP was tolerated without
adverse effects. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8409113&amp;query_hl=12]

=== Responses ===
The [[American Cancer Society]] argues that ''since aspartame is broken down into these components before it is absorbed into the blood stream, aspartame in its initial form does not have the opportunity to travel to target organs, including the brain, to cause cancer.'' [http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ped/content/ped_1_3x_aspartame.asp] The 
[http://www.feingold.org/ Feingold Association] has stated that aspartame ''is reported to cause a variety of neurological effects from headache to seizures and brain tumors.'' 
[http://www.feingold.org/06-2003.html#are] The [[American Heart Association]] concludes 
that ''extensive investigation so far hasn't shown any serious side effects from aspartame.'' [http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4447] A consumer alert issued by the [http://www.acash.org/ Association for Consumers Action on Safety and Health] was published related to the dangers of ingesting aspartame. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Aspartame-acash1.jpg] The [[National Cancer Institute]] argues ''there is no evidence that the regulated artificial sweeteners on the market in the United States are related to cancer risk in humans.'' [http://cis.nci.nih.gov/fact/3_19.htm] The [http://www.thenhf.com National Health Federation] calls aspartame a ''neurotoxic artificial sweetener.'' [http://www.thenhf.com/articles_46.htm] The [[FDA]] says the more than ''100 toxicological and clinical studies it has reviewed confirm that aspartame is safe for the general population.'' [http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/1999/699_sugar.html]  The consumer organization [http://campaignfortruth.com/Eclub/230605/ UK Campaign for Truth in Medicine] says that ''Aspartame is, by far, the most dangerous substance on the market that is added to foods.'' [http://www.campaignfortruth.com/sugarbody.htm] There have been more than 600 studies on aspartame and thousands of studies on aspartame breakdown products and metabolites. It is not known whether persons writing the opinion for the above-mentioned organizations have read the bulk of the published research on aspartame or whether they are relying on summaries provided to them.

=== Recently-published research===

A large three-year study into the long-term effects of eating aspartame in rats by the European Ramazzini Foundation for cancer research in Bologna, Italy was published in September 2005. It found evidence that aspartame caused cancer of the kidney, and of the peripheral nerves, mainly in the head. It also reported an increased risk of leukaemias and lymphomas in female rats. Manufacturers of aspartame have challenged the validity of the study.

'''AutoCAD''' is a suite of popular [[computer-aided design|CAD]] [[computer software|software]] products for 2- and 3-[[dimension]]al design and drafting, developed and sold by [[Autodesk]].  The AutoCAD family of products, taken as a whole, are the most widely used CAD software in the world.

==Description==
Initially a general-purpose 2D drafting program, AutoCAD has evolved into a family of products which provide a [[platform (computing)|platform]] for 2D and 3D CAD.  Today, it is used by [[Civil Engineering|civil engineers]], [[Land_development|land developers]], [[architects]], [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical engineers]], [[Interior Design|interior designers]] and other design professionals.

Modern AutoCAD includes a full set of basic solid modelling and 3D tools, but lacks the advanced capabilities of [[solid modelling]] applications.  AutoCAD can co-exist with such products as a 2D drafting tool.

Like other CAD programs, AutoCAD is fundamentally a [[vector graphics]] drawing program.  It uses primitive entities -- such as lines, polylines, circles, arcs, and text -- as the foundation for more complex objects.
[[Image:AutoCAD2005.jpg|thumb|left|A snapshot taken in AutoCAD 2005 while transcribing a curve.]]
AutoCAD supports a number of [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) for customization and automation.  These include [[AutoLISP]], Visual LISP, and [[VBA]].  
AutoCAD's license-based API, [[ObjectARX]], can be used; a [[C++]] class library, which was also the base for products extending AutoCAD functionality to specific fields, to create products such as Autodesk Architectural Desktop, AutoCAD Electrical, or third-party AutoCAD based applications.

AutoCAD's native file format, [[DWG|AutoCAD DWG]], and to a lesser extent, its interchange file format, [[AutoCAD DXF|DXF]], have become [[de facto]] standards for interchange of 2D CAD data.  In 2006, Autodesk estimated the number of active DWG files to be in excess of one billion.  In the past, Autodesk has estimated the total number of DWG files in existence to be more than three billion.

AutoCAD currently runs exclusively on [[Microsoft]] desktop [[operating system]]s.  Versions for [[Unix]] and [[Apple Macintosh]] were released in the 1980s, but these met with limited market acceptance and were later dropped.  It usually suffers from poor performance when run in an [[emulator]] or [[compatibility layer]] like [[Virtual PC]] or [[Wine (software)|Wine]].

===AutoCAD LT===

AutoCAD LT is a &quot;scaled down&quot; version of AutoCAD.  &quot;LT&quot; does not stand for &quot;light&quot;; it originally stood for &quot;lap top&quot;.  (One pronounces the letters individually.)  When AutoCAD LT was first introduced in 1993, laptop computers did not have the performance features they have today.  A version of AutoCAD with a reduced feature set, and thus a smaller memory footprint, was needed for portable use.  AutoCAD LT was the result.

[[2006|Today]], Autodesk sells AutoCAD LT for its much lower price.  It is marketed as a CAD package for those who only need 2D functionality.  Compared with AutoCAD proper, AutoCAD LT lacks several features, has almost no 3D capabilities, and does not include any programming interfaces.

===Overlay programs===

Autodesk has also developed overlay programs, sometimes called Desktops, for discipline-specific enhancements.  Architectural Desktop, for example, permits architectural designers to draw objects such as walls, doors and windows, with more intelligent data associated with them, rather than simple objects such as lines and circles.  The data can be programmed to represent specific architectural products sold in the construction industry, or extracted into a data file for pricing, materials estimation, and other values related to the objects represented.  Similarly, Civil Design, Civil Design 3D, and Civil Design Professional allow data-specific objects to be used, allowing standard civil engineering calculations to be made and represented easily. Additionally, Autodesk Inventor allows the technician to design any moving object (or idea!) and visually represent movements on screen.

===Templates===

Incorporated into AutoCAD 2000 (Release 15), was the ability to create a template. Not like most other software programs, this template (called paperspace) allowed users to draw/design on an exact representation of the sheet of paper they would ouput to. Draw a line 100mm - it would print 100mm.

===Blocks===

In AutoCAD, blocks are objects that can be reused. On the Web there are many sites that provide AutoCAD blocks, linetypes, hatch patterns, etc.  In version 2006, AutoCAD adds '''dynamic blocks,''' which have capabilities similar to the symbols used in [[Microsoft Visio]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''AutoCAD DXF''' (Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format) is a CAD data [[file format]], developed by [[Autodesk]] as their solution for enabling [[CAD data exchange | data interoperability]] between [[AutoCAD]] and other programs.

DXF was originally introduced in December 1982 as part of AutoCAD 1.0, and was intended to provide an exact representation of the data in the AutoCAD native file format, [[DWG]] (Drawing), for which Autodesk did (and does) not publish specifications.  Autodesk currently publishes specifications on its website for versions of DXF dating from AutoCAD Release 13 (November 1994) to AutoCAD 2006 (March 2005.)

Versions of AutoCAD from Release 10 (October 1988) and up support both [[ASCII]] and [[Binary and text files|binary]] forms of DXF.  Earlier versions support only the ASCII form.

As AutoCAD has become more powerful, supporting more complex object types, DXF has become less useful.  Certain object types, including [[ACIS]] solids and regions, are not documented.  Other object types, including AutoCAD 2006's dynamic blocks, and all of the objects specific to the vertical-market versions of AutoCAD, are partially documented, but not at a sufficient level to allow other developers to support them.

Almost all significant commercial application software developers, including all of Autodesk's competitors, choose to support DWG as their primary format for AutoCAD data interoperability, using libraries from the Open Design Alliance - a non-profit industry consortium which has reverse-engineered the DWG file format. 

==File structure==
ASCII versions of DXF it can be read with a text-editor. The basic organization of a DXF file is as follows:

*'''HEADER''' section - General information about the drawing. Each parameter has a variable name and an associated value.
*'''CLASSES'''section - Holds the information for application-defined classes whose instances appear in the BLOCKS, ENTITIES, and
OBJECTS sections of the database.  Generally does not provide sufficient information to allow interoperability with other programs.
*'''TABLES''' section - This section contains definitions of named items.
:Application ID (APPID) table
:Block Recod (BLOCK_RECORD) table
:Dimension Style (DIMSTYPE) table
:Layer (LAYER) table
:Linetype (LTYPE) table
:Text style (STYLE) table
:User Coordinate System (UCS) table
:View (VIEW)table
:Viewport configuration (VPORT) table
*'''BLOCKS''' section - This section contains Block Definition entities describing the entities comprising each Block in the drawing.
*'''ENTITIES''' section - This section contains the drawing entities, including any Block References.
*'''OBJECTS''' section -- Contains the data that apply to nongraphical objects, used by AutoLISP and ObjectARX applications.
*'''THUMBNAILIMAGE''' section -- contains the preview image for the DXF file.
*'''END OF FILE'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:caduco.jpg|thumb|400px|Asexual reproduction in liverworts: a caducuous phylloid germinating]]
'''Asexual reproduction''' (also known as '''''agamogenesis''''') is a form of reproduction which does not involve [[meiosis]], [[gamete]] formation, or [[fertilization]]. In laymen's terms, there is only one &quot;parent&quot; involved. This form of reproduction is common among simple organisms such as [[amoeba]] and other [[single-celled organism]]s, although most [[plant]]s produce asexually as well (see [[vegetative reproduction]]).

Because it does not require male and female participation, asexual reproduction occurs faster than sexual reproduction and requires less energy. Additionally, asexual reproduction produces an exact [[replica]] of the parent due to the lack of [[genetic recombination]]. From an [[evolution]]ary standpoint, one could thus argue that asexual reproduction is inferior because it stifles the potential for change. However, there is also a significantly reduced chance of [[mutation]] or other complications that can result from the mixing of genes.

Many, but not all, single-celled organisms produce asexually through [[binary fission]]. Some single-celled organisms rely on one or more [[host]] organisms in order to reproduce, but most literally divide into two organisms. An exception to the rule are [[ciliate]]s, which reproduce both sexually and asexually. All [[prokaryote]]s (the vast majority of which are [[unicellular]]) reproduce asexually.

There are three types of asexual reproduction utilized by plants: [[regeneration]], [[vegetative reproduction]], and spore formation. The last type, spore formation, involves the production of reproductive cells called [[spore]]s that contain [[DNA]] and develop into a new organism after dispersal. This method of reproduction is found in the [[fern]]s, and involves sporogenesis without meiosis. Thus the chromosome number of the spore cell is the same as that of the parent producing the spores.


==Examples of asexual reproduction in higher organisms==

The cape bee [[Apis mellifera capensis]] is known to sometimes reproduce asexually through a process called [[thelytoky]].

[[Identical Twins]] are also a form of asexual reproduction in humans.

'''Aelbert Jacobsz Cuyp''' ([[Dordrecht]] [[October 20]], [[1620]] - Dordrecht [[November 15]], [[1691]]) was one of the leading [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[landscape painting|landscape]] [[painter]]s of the [[17th century]]. The most famous of a family of painters, the pupil of his father [[Jacob Gerritsz. Cuyp]] (1594&amp;ndash;1651/52), he is especially known for his views of the Dutch countryside in early morning or late afternoon. Sunlight in his paintings rakes across the panel, accentuating small bits of detail in the golden light. In large, atmospheric panoramas of the countryside, the highlights on a blade of meadow grass, the mane of a tranquil horse, the horn of a dairy cow reclining by a stream, or the tip of a peasant's hat are all caught in a bath of yellow ocher light. The  quality of paint in a picture by Cuyp is unmistakably masterful. The richly [[varnish|varnished]] medium refracts the rays of light like a jewel as it dissolves into numerous glazed layers.

Cuyp's drawings reveal him to be a draftsman of superior quality. Light-drenched washes of [[Walnut ink|golden brown ink]] depict a distant view of the city of [[Dordrecht]] or [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].
A Cuyp drawing may look like he intended it to be, a finished work of art; but it was most likely taken back to the studio and used as a reference for his paintings. Often the same section of a sketch can be found in several different pictures. Cuyp's landscapes were based on reality and on his own invention of what an enchanting landscape should be.

Cuyp signed many of his works but rarely dated them, so that a chronology of his career has not been satisfactorily reassembled. A phenomenal number of paintings are ascribed to him, some of which are likely to be by other masters of the golden landscape, such as '''Abraham Calraet''' (1642&amp;ndash;1722), whose initials ''A.C.'' may be mistaken for Cuyp's.

An '''alkene''' in [[organic chemistry]] is an [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] [[hydrocarbon]] containing at least one [[carbon]] to [[carbon]] [[double bond]]. The simplest alkenes, with only one double bond, form a [[homologous series]], ''the alkenes'' with general formula '''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

The simplest alkene is C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which has the common name &quot;[[ethylene]]&quot; and the  [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) name &quot;[[ethene]]&quot;. Alkenes are also called [[olefin|olefins]] and [[vinyl]] compounds.

== Structure of Alkenes ==
=== Shape of Alkenes ===
As predicted by the [[VSEPR theory|VSEPR]] model of [[electron]] pair replusion, in the [[molecular geometry]] of alkenes the [[bond angle]]s about each carbon in a double bond are about 120&amp;deg;, although the angle may be larger because of [[steric strain]] introduced by [[nonbonded interactions]] created by [[functional group]]s attached to the carbons of the double bond. For example, the C-C-C bond angle in [[propene]] is 123.9&amp;deg;. The alkene double bond is stronger than a single [[covalent bond]] and also shorter with an average [[bond length]] of 133 [[picometre]].

=== Molecular Geometry===
Like single [[covalent bond]]s, double bonds can be described in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals, except that unlike a single bond (which consist of a single [[sigma bond]]), a carbon-carbon double bond consists of one [[sigma bond]] and one [[pi bond]].

Each carbon of the double bond uses its three ''sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' hybrid orbitals to form sigma bonds to three atoms. The unhybridized ''2p'' atomic orbitals, which lie perpendicular to the plane created by the axes of the three ''sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' hybrid orbitals, combine to form the pi bond.

Because it requires a large amount of energy to break a pi bond (264 [[joules|kJ]]/[[Mole (unit)|mol]] in ethylene), rotation about the carbon-carbon double bond is very difficult and therefore severely restricted. As a consequence substituted alkenes exist as one of two [[isomer]]s called a [[cis isomer]] and a [[trans isomer]]. In cis-2-butene two [[methyl]] substituents face the same side of the double bond and in trans-2-butene they face the opposite site.

It is certainly not impossible to twist a double bond. In fact a 90° twist requires an energy approximately equal to half the strength of a [[pi bond]]. The misalignment of the [[p orbital]]s is less than expected because [[pyridalization]] takes place. [[cyclooctene|Trans-cyclooctene]] is a stable strained alkene and the orbital misalignment is only 19° with a [[dihedral angle]] of 137° (normal 120°) and a degree of pyramidalization of 18°. This explains the [[dipole]] moment of 0.8 [[debye|D]] for this compound ([[cis-isomer]] 0.4 D) where a value of zero is expected {{Ref|Barrows}}. The trans isomer of [[cycloheptene]] is only stable at low temperatures.

==Physical properties==
The physical properties of alkenes are comparable with [[alkane]]s. The [[Physical state]] depends on [[molecular mass]]. The simplest alkenes, [[ethylene]], [[propylene]] and [[butylene]] are gases.

==Chemical properties==
Alkenes are relatively stable compounds, but are more reactive than [[alkane]]s. This is compatible with the idea that the carbon-carbon double bond (in alkenes) is stronger than the carbon-carbon single bond (in alkanes), however, as the majority of the reactions of alkenes involve the rupture of this bond to form two new [[sigma bond|single bonds]].

==Synthesis==
*The most common industrial synthesis path for alkenes is [[cracking (chemistry) | cracking]] of [[petroleum]].
*Alkenes can be synthesized from [[alcohol]]s via an [[Elimination reaction|elimination]] reaction that removes one water molecule:&lt;BR&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
* An [[Elimination reaction]] from an [[amine]] occurs in the [[Hofmann elimination]] and the [[Cope reaction]]
*[[Catalytic]] synthesis of higher &amp;alpha;-alkenes can be achieved by a reaction of [[Ethylene|ethene]] with triethylaluminium, an [[organometallic]] compound in the presence of [[nickel]], [[cobalt]] or [[platinum]].
*Alkenes scramble in an [[olefin metathesis]]
*Alkenes are generated from a [[ketone]] and an [[alkyl halide]] in the [[Wittig reaction]], from two different ketones in the [[Barton-Kellogg reaction]] and from coupling of one ketone in the [[Bamford-Stevens reaction]] or the [[Shapiro reaction]].
*Alkenes are generated from a [[coupling reaction]] of [[vinyl]] [[halide]]s
*Alkenes are generated from selective reduction of [[alkyne]]s
*Alkenes [[rearrangement reaction|rearrange]] in a [[Diels-Alder reaction]] and an [[Ene reaction]]

== Reactions ==
===Addition reactions===
Alkenes reacts in many [[addition reaction]]s.
* [[Catalytic addition of hydrogen]]: [[Catalytic]] hydrogenation of '''alkenes''' produce the corresponding [[alkane]]s. The reaction is carried out under pressure in the presence of a metallic [[catalyst]]. Common industrial catalysts are based on [[platinum]], [[nickel]] or [[palladium]], for laboratory syntheses, [[Raney's nickel]] is often employed. This is an [[alloy]] of [[nickel]] and [[aluminium]]. This is the catalytic hydrogenation of [[ethylene]] to yield [[ethane]]: CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

* [[Electrophilic addition]]: Most addition reactions to [[alkenes]] follow the mechanism of [[electrophilic addition]]. An example is the [[Prins reaction]] where the electrophile is a [[carbonyl]] group.
*[[Halogenation]]: Addition of elementary [[bromine]] or [[chlorine]] to [[alkenes]] yield [[vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] dibromo- and dichloroalkanes, respectively. The decoloration of a solution of bromine in water is an analytical test for the presence of alkenes:

:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; BrCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br

:This is the mechanism for the reaction:
:[[image:AlkeneAndBr2Reaction.png|600px]]
:The reaction works because the high electron density at the double bond causes a temporary shift of electrons in the Br-Br bond causing a temporary induced dipole. This makes the Br closest to the double bond slightly positive and therefore an electrophile.
*Hydrohalogenation: Addition of [[hydrohalic acids]] like [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]] or HBr to alkenes yield the corresponding [[haloalkane]]s.&lt;BR&gt; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HBr &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH'''Br'''-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;BR&gt; If the two carbon atoms at the double bond are linked to a different number of hydrogen atoms, the halogen is found preferentially at the carbon with less hydrogen substituents ([[Markovnikov's rule]]).
:This is the reaction mechanism for Hydrohalogenation:
:[[image:AlkeneAndHBrReaction.png|600px]]
*Addition of a [[carbene]] or [[carbenoid]] yields the corresponding [[cyclopropane]]

=== Oxidation ===
Alkenes are [[organic oxidation|oxidized]] with a large number of [[oxidizing agent]]s.
*In the presence of [[oxygen]], [[alkenes]] burn with a bright flame to [[carbon dioxide]] and water.
*[[Catalytic]] oxidation with oxygen or the reaction with [[percarboxylic]] acids yields [[epoxide]]s
*Reaction with ozone in [[ozonolysis]] leads to the breaking of the double bond, yielding two [[aldehyde]]s or [[ketone]]s&lt;BR&gt; R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CH=CH-R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CHO + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CHO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;BR&gt; This reaction can be used to determine the position of a double bond in an unknown [[alkene]].

===Polymerisation===
[[Polymerization]] of [[alkene]]s is an economically important reaction which yields [[polymer]]s of high industrial value, such as the plastics [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]]. Polymerization can either proceed via a free-[[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] or an ionic mechanism.

==Nomenclature of Alkenes==
===IUPAC Names===
To form the root of the [[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] names for alkenes, simply change the -an- infix of the parent to -en-. For example, '''CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the [[alkane]] ''ethANe''. The name of '''CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' is therefore ''ethENe''.

In higher alkenes, where [[isomers]] exist that differ in location of the double bond, the following numbering system is used:
#Number the longest carbon chain that contains the double bond in the direction that gives the carbon atoms of the double bond the lowest possible numbers.
#Indicate the location of the double bond by the location of its first carbon
#Name branched or substituted alkenes in a manner similar to [[alkane]]s.
#Number the carbon atoms, locate and name substituent groups, locate the double bond, and name the main chain

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:propyl_allene.png|right|thumb|[[Propyl allene]] is the simplest allene.]]

An '''allene''' is a [[hydrocarbon]] in which one atom of [[carbon]] is connected by [[covalent bond|double bonds]] with two other atoms of carbon.  Allene also is the common name for the parent compound of this series, 1,2-propadiene.

Such pair of bonds make allenes much more reactive than other [[alkene]]s.
For example, their reactivity with gaseous [[chlorine]] is more like the reactivity of [[alkyne]]s.

In the image at right, if groups &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; replace the hydrogens on the left and right side, the molecule will be [[chiral]] if &quot;a&quot; is not identical to &quot;b&quot;.  This is due to the two sets of groups being perpendicular to each other, and thus the molecule has no mirror plane.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Alkyne.png|Alkyne|right]]
'''Alkynes''' are [[hydrocarbon]]s that have at least one [[triple bond]] between two [[carbon]] atoms.  The alkynes are traditionally known as '''acetylenes''', although the name acetylene is also used to refer specifically to the simplest member of the series, known officially as [[ethyne]]. 


== Structure==

The carbon atoms in an alkyne bond are [[sp hybridized]]: they each have 2 [[p orbital]]s and 2 [[Orbital hybridisation|sp hybrid orbitals]]. Overlap of an sp orbital from each atom forms one sp-sp [[sigma bond]]. Each p orbital on one atom overlaps one on the other atom, forming two [[pi bond]]s, giving a total of three bonds. The remaining sp orbital on each atom can form a sigma bond to another atom, for example to hydrogen atoms in the parent compound [[acetylene]]. The two sp orbitals on an atom are on opposite sides of the atom: in acetylene, the H-C-C [[bond angle]]s are 180°. Because a total of 6 electrons take part in bonding this triple bond is very strong with a [[bond strength]] of 837 kJ/mol. The sigma bond contributes 369 kJ/mol, the first pi bond contributes 268 kJ/mol and the second pi bond is weak with 202 kJ/mol bond strength. The CC bond distance with 121 [[picometer]]s is also much less than that of the [[alkene]] bond which is 134 pm or the alkane bond with 153 pm.

==Chemical properties==

Unlike [[alkane|alkanes]], [[alkyne|alkynes]] are unstable and very reactive. This gives rise to the intense heat of the acetylene flame used in welding. 

==Examples==

The simplest alkyne is [[ethyne]] ([[acetylene]]):

[[image:ethyne.png]]

==Terminal and internal alkynes==
Terminal alkynes have a hydrogen atom bonded to at least one of the sp hybridized carbons (those involved in the triple bond.  An example would be [[methylacetylene]] (1-propyne under IUPAC nomenclature).

Internal alkynes have something other than hydrogen attached to the sp hybridized carbons, usually another carbon atom, but could be a heteroatom. A good example is 2-pentyne, in which there is a methyl group on one side of the triple bond and an ethyl group on the other side.

==Metal acetylides==
A terminal alkyne with a [[strong base]] such as [[sodium]], [[sodium amide]], [[n-butyllithium]] or a [[grignard reagent]] gives the [[anion]] of the terminal alkyne and a '''metal acetylide'''. Acetylenes are fairly acidic and have [[Acid dissociation constant|pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] values (25) between that of [[ammonia]] (35) or [[ethanol]] with 16. The explanation for this acidity is that the negative charge in acetylide is stabilized as a result of the high s character of the sp orbital in which the electron pair resides. [[Electron|Electrons]] in a s orbital benefit from closer proximity to the positively charged atom nucleus and therefore lower in energy. 

== Synthesis ==
Alkynes are generally prepared by [[dehydrohalogenation]] of [[Vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] alkyl [[dihalide]]s or the reaction of metal acetylides with primary [[alkyl halide]]s. In the [[Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement]] an alkyne is prepared starting from a [[vinyl|vinyl bromide]]. 

Alkynes can be prepared from [[aldehyde]]s using the [[Corey-Fuchs reaction]] or the [[Seyferth-Gilbert homologation]].

==Reactions==
Alkynes are involved in many [[organic reaction]]s.

* [[electrophilic addition]] reactions
** addition of [[hydrogen]] to the [[alkene]] or the [[alkane]]
** addition of [[halogen]]s to the vinyl halides or alkyl halides
** addition of [[hydrogen halide]]s to the corresponding [[vinyl halide]]s or [[alkyl halide]]s
** addition of water to the [[carbonyl]] compound (through the [[enol]] intermediate)
* [[Cycloaddition]]s
** [[Diels-Alder reaction]] with [[2-pyrone]] to an [[aromatic]] compound after elimination of [[carbon dioxide]]
** [[Azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition]] to [[triazole]]s
** [[Bergman cyclization]] of enediynes to an [[aromatic]] compound
** [[Alkyne trimerisation]] to [[aromatic]] compounds
** scrambling of alkynes in [[alkyne metathesis]] to new alkyne compounds
** [2+2+1]cycloaddition of an alkyne, [[alkene]] and [[carbon monoxide]] in the [[Pauson–Khand reaction]]
* [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions of metal acetylides
** new [[carbon-carbon bond]] formation with alkyl halides 
* [[nucleophilic addition]] reactions of metal acetylides
** reaction with [[carbonyl]] compounds to an intermediate [[alkoxide]] and then to the [[hydroxyalkyne]] after acidic workup.
* [[hydroboration]] reaction of alkynes with [[organoborane]]s to vinylic boranes
** followed by reduction by [[hydrogen peroxide]] to the corresponding [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]]
* oxidative cleavage with [[potassium permanganate]] to the [[carboxylic acid]]s

'''AbiWord''' is a [[Free software|free]] [[Word processor|word processing]] program under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] which runs on [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[ReactOS]], [[SkyOS]], [[BeOS]] and other [[operating system]]s. AbiWord was originally started by [[SourceGear]] Corporation as the first component of AbiSuite, as an ambitious plan to create a full Office Suite that would be [[free software]] / [[open source software]] . SourceGear gradually moved to other business interests and the project is currently run entirely by a team of volunteer developers.  AbiWord is part of [[GNOME Office]], a collection of office applications with some degree of integration.

AbiWord Version 1.0 was released on [[April 18]], [[2002]] and received praise for its speed and small size. However version 1.0 did not yet include support for table based layout, which many users considered an essential feature. Table support was finally included as planned for version 2.0, which was released on [[September 15]], [[2003]].

AbiWord has several import/export filters including [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], [[HTML]], [[OpenOffice.org]], [[Microsoft Word]] and [[LaTeX]]. The native [[file format]] uses [[XML]], so documents written with the program are perceived to be a safe investment from a digital archiving perspective.

AbiWord has a very similar user interface to Microsoft Word to help make it easier for new users to migrate to Abiword.  Although there are differences, the AbiWord developers aim to embrace and copy the design of Microsoft Word or extend it and produce a better improved design.  

The name AbiWord is derived from the root of the Spanish word &quot;Abierto&quot; meaning open.  The English pronunciation sounds like &quot;Abbey&quot; Word.  

AbiWord contains a [[Wikipedia]] [[plugin]] to look up an encyclopedic reference for a selected word [http://www.abisource.com/mailinglists/abiword-dev/01/December/0391.html].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Ames test''' is a biological assay used in [[genetics]], generally [[genetic toxicology]], to test for [[mutagenic]] properties of a chemical compound. A compound is said to be [[mutagenic]] if it causes a change in the [[DNA]] (deoxyriboneucleic acid) of a living cell or organism. The test is named after its inventor, [[Bruce Ames]].

== General procedure ==
This assay is carried out using strains of [[bacterium|bacteria]], generally [[Escherichia coli]] or [[Salmonella]] that already have a single mutation, for example, a [[strain]] that cannot produce [[histidine]], an [[amino acid]] that is essential for the bacterium to grow if not provided externally with essential nutrients. Cultures of the bacteria are grown in an [[agar]] containing dish so that a &quot;lawn&quot; of bacteria is present.

The experimental cultures are exposed to the agent to be tested while the positive control cultures are exposed to a known mutagen to confirm that there has been no contamination of the strain. Strains of bacteria are available which have been genetically modified such that only a certain type of mutation (i.e. a base pair mutation or a frameshift mutation) will cause the strand to revert to a normal state, not requiring nutrients to grow. If the mutation screened for has in fact occurred, dense spots in the colonies will form. A certain number of spots may form due to random mutation not caused by the agent; therefore, data analysis using control dishes is necessary. Occasionally a tested agent will be toxic enough to simply kill the bacterial culture in which case a &quot;thin lawn&quot; is observed.

== S-9 ==
In some Ames assays an S-9 mix is added. The S-9 mix contains liver [[enzymes]], generally from a [[rat]]. These enzymes can metabolize the agent being tested in order to predict the mutagenic properties within a living system, specifically the source of the S-9 enzymes.

== Mutagenic and carcinogenic correlation ==
Studies have shown that the majority of substances shown to be mutagenic by an Ames assay will be [[carcinogenic]] in humans.

      <comment>/* Use in combination with ACE inhibitors */ add info</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''ACE inhibitors''', or inhibitors of [[angiotensin-converting enzyme|'''A'''ngiotensin-'''C'''onverting '''E'''nzyme]], are a group of [[pharmaceutical]]s that are used primarily in treatment of [[hypertension]] and [[congestive heart failure]], in most cases as the drugs of first choice.

==Clinical use==

Indications of ACE inhibitors include:

* Prevention of [[cardiovascular]] disorders
* [[Congestive heart failure]]
* [[Hypertension]]
* Left [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] dysfunction
* Prevention of [[nephropathy]] in [[diabetes mellitus]]

In several of these indications, ACE inhibitors are used first-line as several agents in the class have been clinically shown to be superior to other classes of drugs in the reduction of [[morbidity]] and [[mortality]].

ACE inhibitors are often combined with [[diuretic]]s in the control of hypertension (usually a [[thiazide]]), when an ACE inhibitor alone proves insufficient; and in chronic heart failure (usually [[furosemide]]) for improved symptomatic control. Thus there exists, on the market, combination products combining an ACE inhibitor with a thiazide (usually [[hydrochlorothiazide]]) in a single tablet to allow easy administration by patients.

==Mechanism of action==
They work by modulating the [[renin-angiotensin system|renin-angiotensin-aldosterone]] (RAS or RAAS) system. By inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme, ACE inhibitors significantly (but not completely) block the conversion of [[angiotensin|angiotensin I]] to [[angiotensin|angiotensin II]]. As a complementary action, ACE inhibitors also reduce the degradation of [[bradykinin]]. Thus ACE inhibitors work to lower blood pressure by decreasing the ''formation'' of a potent vasoconstrictor (angiotensin II) and decreasing the ''degradation'' of a potent vasodilator (bradykinin).

==Effects of ACE inhibitors==
ACE inhibitors lower [[arteriole|arteriolar]] resistance and increase venous capacitance; increase [[cardiac output]] and [[cardiac index]], stroke work and [[stroke volume|volume]], lower renovascular resistance, and lead to increased [[natriuresis]] (excretion of [[sodium]] in the [[urine]]).

[[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] and clinical studies have shown that ACE inhibitors reduce the progress of [[diabetic nephropathy]] independently from their blood pressure-lowering effect. This action of ACE inhibitors is utilised in the prevention of diabetic renal failure.

ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective for indications other than hypertension even in patients with normal blood pressure. The use of a maximum dose of ACE inhibitors in such patients (including for prevention of diabetic nephropathy, congestive heart failure, prophylaxis of cardiovascular events) is justified because it improves clinical outcomes, independent of the blood pressure lowering effect of ACE inhibitors. Such therapy, of course, requires careful and gradual titration of the dose to prevent the patient suffering from the effects of rapidly decreasing their blood pressure (dizziness, fainting, ''etc'').

==Adverse effects==
Common adverse drug reactions include: [[hypotension]], [[cough]], [[hyperkalaemia]], [[headache]], [[Vertigo (medical)|dizziness]], [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]], renal impairment (Rossi, 2004).

A persistent dry cough is a relatively common adverse effect believed to be associated with the increases in [[bradykinin]] levels produced by ACE inhibitors. Patients who experience this cough are often switched to [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s.

Rash and taste disturbances, infrequent with most ACE inhibitors, are more prevalent in [[captopril]] and is attributed to its sulfhydryl moiety. This has led to decreased use of captopril in clinical setting, although it is still used in [[scintigraphy]] of the kidney.

Renal impairment is a significant adverse effect of all ACE inhibitors, and is associated with their effect on angiotensin II-mediated [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] functions such as renal bloodflow. ACE inhibitors can induce or exacerbate renal impairment in patients with [[renal artery stenosis]]. This is especially a problem if the patient is also concomitantly taking an [[NSAID]] and a [[diuretic]] - the so-called &quot;triple whammy&quot; effect - such patients are at very high risk of developing renal failure (Thomas, 2000).

Some patients develop [[angioedema]] due to increased bradykinin levels. There appears to be a genetic predisposition towards this side-effect in patients who degrade bradykinin slower than average (Molinaro 2002).

==Examples of ACE inhibitors==
ACE inhibitors can be divided into three groups based on their molecular structure:

===Sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitors===

* [[Captopril]] (Capoten®), the first ACE inhibitor

===Dicarboxylate-containing ACE inhibitors===

This is the largest group, including:

* [[Enalapril]] (Vasotec®/Renitec®)
* [[Ramipril]] (Altace®/Tritace®/Ramace®)
* [[Quinapril]] (Accupril®)
* [[Perindopril]] (Coversyl®)
* [[Lisinopril]] (Lisodur®/Prinivil®/Zestril®)

===Phosphonate-containing ACE inhibitors===

* [[Fosinopril]] (Monopril®), the only member

===Naturally occurring===

[[Casokinin]]s and [[lactokinin]]s are breakdown products of [[casein]] and [[whey]] that occur naturally after ingestion of [[milk]] products, especially [[sour milk]]. Their role in blood pressure control is uncertain. (FitzGerald ''et al'', 2004)

==Comparative information==

Comparatively, all ACE inhibitors have similar antihypertensive efficacy when equivalent doses are administered. The main point-of-difference lies with captopril, the first ACE inhibitor, which has a shorter duration of action and increased incidence of certain adverse effects (see the captopril article for more detail).

Certain agents in the ACE inhibitor class have been proven, in large clinical studies, to reduce mortality post-[[myocardial infarct]], prevent development of heart failure, ''etc''. While these effects are likely to be  class-effects, good [[evidence-based medicine]] practice would direct the use of those agents with established clinical efficacy (see AMH 2004, or other sources for more details on specific agents).

==Contraindications and precautions==

The ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with:

* Previous [[angioedema]] associated with ACE inhibitor therapy
* [[Renal artery stenosis]] (bilateral, or unilateral with a solitary functioning kidney)

ACE inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with:

* Impaired renal function
* [[Aortic valve stenosis]] or cardiac outflow obstruction
* [[Hypovolaemia]] or [[dehydration]]
* [[Haemodialysis]] with high flux polyacrylonitrile membranes

ACE inhibitors are [[Australian Drug Evaluation Committee|ADEC]] [[Pregnancy category]] D, and should be avoided in women who are likely to become pregnant. (Rossi, 2005)

Potassium supplementation should be used with caution and under medical supervision owing to the [[hyperkalemia|hyperkalaemic]] effect of ACE inhibitors.

==Angiotensin II receptor antagonists==

ACE inhibitors share many common characteristics with another class of cardiovascular drugs called [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s, which are often used when patients are intolerant of the adverse effects produced by ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors do not completely prevent the formation of angiotensin II, as there are other conversion pathways, and so angiotensin II receptor antagonists may be useful because they act to prevent the action of angiotensin II at the AT&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor.

===Use in combination with ACE inhibitors===
While counterintuitive at first glance, the combination therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with ACE inhibitors may be superior to either agent alone.  This combination may increase levels of bradykinin while blocking the generation of angiotensin II and its activity at the AT&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor.  This 'dual blockade' may be more effective than using an ACE inhibitor alone, because angiotensin II can be generated via non-ACE-dependent pathways.  Preliminary studies suggest that this combination of pharmacologic agents may be advantageous in the treatment of [[essential hypertension]], chronic [[heart failure]], and [[nephropathy]]. (van de Wal et al., 2005) However, more studies are needed to confirm these highly preliminary results.  While statistically significant results have been obtained for its role in treating hypertension, clinical significance may be lacking. (Finnegan &amp; Gleason, 2003)

Patients with heart failure may benefit from the combination in terms of reducing [[morbidity]] and [[ventricular remodeling]]. (Krum et al., 2004; Solomon et al., 2005)

The most compelling evidence has been found for the treatment of nephropathy: this combination therapy partially reversed the [[proteinuria]] and also exhibited a renoprotective effect in patients afflicted with [[diabetic nephropathy]], (Luno et al., 2005) and pediatric [[IgA nephropathy]]. (Yang et al., 2005)

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''antianginal''' is any [[Medication|drug]] used in the treatment of ''[[angina pectoris]]'', a symptom of [[coronary heart disease|ischaemic heart disease]].

Drugs used are [[nitrate]]s such as [[nitroglycerin]] (glyceryl trinitrate) or [[pentaerythritol tetranitrate]]; [[beta blocker]]s, either cardioselectives such as [[acebutolol]] or [[metoprolol]], or non-cardioselectives such as [[oxprenolol]] or [[sotalol]]; or [[calcium channel blocker]]s, either Class I agents (''e.g.'', [[verapamil]]), Class II agents (''e.g.'', [[amlodipine]], [[nifedipine]]), or the Class III agent [[diltiazem]].

[[Nitrates]] cause [[vasodilation]] of the venous capacitance vessels by simulating the [[endothelium-derived relaxing factor]] (EDRF). Used to relieve both exertional and vasospastic angina by allowing venous pooling, reducing the pressure in the ventricles and so reducing wall tension and oxygen requirements in the heart. Short-acting nitrates are used to abort [[angina]] attacks that have occurred, while longer-acting nitrates are used in the prophylactic management of the condition.

[[Beta blockers]] are used in the prophylaxis of exertional angina by reducing the work the heart is allowed to perform below the level that would provoke an angina attack. They cannot be used in vasospastic angina and can precipitate heart failure.

[[Calcium]] [[ion]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt;) antagonists ([[Calcium channel blocker]]s) are used in the treatment of both exertional and vasospastic angina. In vitro, they dilate the coronary and peripheral arteries and have negative inotropic and chronotropic effects - decreasing [[afterload]], improving myocardial efficiency, reducing [[heart rate]] and improving coronary blood flow.
''In vivo'', the vasodilation and [[hypotension]] trigger the [[baroreceptor]] reflex. Therefore the net effect is the interplay of direct and reflex actions. Class I [[antiarrhythmic agents]] have the most potent negative inotropic effect and may cause heart failure; Class II agents do not depress conduction or contractility; the Class III agent has negligible inotropic effect and causes almost no reflex [[tachycardia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System''' is used for the classification of [[Medication|drug]]s. It is controlled by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology, and was first published in 1976.

Drugs are divided into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics.

== Classification ==

In the system drugs are classified into groups at 5 different levels: 

=== First level ===

The first level of the code is based on a letter for the anatomical group and consists of one letter; there are 14 main groups:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| A
| [[ATC code A|Alimentary tract and metabolism]]
|-
| B
| [[ATC code B|Blood and blood forming organs]]
|-
| C
| [[ATC code C|Cardiovascular system]]
|-
| D || [[ATC code D|Dermatologicals]]
|-
| G
| [[ATC code G|Genito-urinary system and sex hormones]]
|-
| H
| [[ATC code H|Systemic hormonal preparations, excluding sex hormones and insulins]]
|-
| J
| [[ATC code J|Anti-infectives for systemic use]]
|-
| L
| [[ATC code L|Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents]]
|-
| M
| [[ATC code M|Musculo-skeletal system]]
|-
| N || [[ATC code N|Nervous system]]
|-

| [[ATC code P|Antiparasitic products, insecticides and repellents]]
|-
| Q
| [[Veterinary drugs]]
|-
| R || [[ATC code R|Respiratory system]]
|-
| S || [[ATC code S|Sensory organs]]
|-
| V || [[ATC code V|Various]]
|}

=== Second level ===

The second level of the code is based on the therapeutic main group and consists of two digits.

=== Third level ===

The third level of the code is based on the therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup and consists of one letter.

=== Fourth level ===

The fourth level of the code is based on the chemical/therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup and consists of one letter.

=== Fifth level ===

The fifth level of the code is based on the chemical substance subgroup and consists of two digits.

=== Further notes ===

The actual drug name used is the [[International Nonproprietary Name]] (INN) when available.

The ATC/DDD system is the ATC system with the addition of a measure of the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults (Defined Daily Doses).

Other ATC classifications are ATCvet (for veterinary medicinal products) and ATC herbal classification (for herbal remedies).

The ATC classification system was based on the Anatomical Classification (AC-system) developed by the [[European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association]] (EPhMRA) and the [[Pharmaceutical Business Intelligence and Research Group]] (PBIRG).

:''Note: in the broadest sense, &quot;air conditioning&quot; can refer to any form of &quot;[[HVAC|heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning]].&quot; This article is specifically about the use of [[refrigeration]] for this purpose.''

:''The first album of the pop group [[Curved Air]] was called Airconditioning''

An '''air conditioner''' (often abbreviated to '''AC''' in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and '''air-con''' in [[Australia]] and  in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]) is an [[appliance]] or [[mechanism]] designed to extract heat from an area using a refrigeration cycle. In construction, a complete system of heating, ventilation and air conditioning is referred to as [[HVAC]].

An [[badgir|earlier form]] of air conditioning was invented in [[Iran|Persia]] (Iran) thousands of years ago in the form of wind shafts on the roof, which caught the wind and passed it through water and blew the cooled air into the building [http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/26911].

The 19th century British scientist and inventor, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that compressing and liquefying a certain gas could chill air when the liquified gas was allowed to evaporate.  His idea remained largely theoretical.

One of the first uses of air conditioning for personal comfort was in 1902 when the [[New York Stock Exchange|New York Stock Exchange's]] new building was equipped with a central cooling as well as heating system. [[Alfred Wolff]], an engineer from [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] who is considered the forerunner in the quest to cool a working environment, helped design the new system, transferring this budding technology from textile mills to commercial buildings.

Later in 1902, the first modern, electrical air conditioning was [[invention|invented]] by [[Willis Haviland Carrier]] ([[1876]]&amp;ndash;[[1950]]). His invention differed from Wolff's in that it controlled not only temperature, but also [[humidity]] for improved manufacturing process control for a printing plant in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]].  This specifically helped to provide low heat and humidity for consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and the Carrier Engineering Company, now called [[UTX|Carrier]] (a division of [[United Technologies Corporation]]), was formed in 1915 to meet the new demand. Later still, air conditioning use was expanded to improve comfort in homes and [[automobile]]s.  Residential sales didn't take off until the 1950's. The [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], is a Landmark Building in building engineering services (built in 1906) and lays claim to being the first “Air conditioned Building in the World”. 

In 1906, [[Stuart Cramer]] first used the term &quot;air conditioning&quot; as he explored ways to add moisture to the air in his southern textile mill. He combined moisture with ventilation to actually &quot;condition&quot; and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants.

The first air conditioners and [[refrigerator]]s employed toxic gases like [[ammonia]] and [[methyl chloride]], which resulted in fatal accidents when they leaked.  [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] created the first chlorofluorocarbon gas, dubbed [[Freon]] in [[1928]]. The refrigerant proved much safer for humans but is harmful to the atmosphere's ozone layer.  &quot;Freon&quot; is a trade name of Dupont for any CFC, HCFC, or HFC refrigerant, the name of each including a number indicating molecular composition (R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134). The blend most used in direct-expansion comfort cooling is an HCFC known as R-22, and is slated to be phased out for use in new equipment by 2010 and completely discontinued by 2020. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the US, the only source for purchase being the cleaned and purified gas recovered from other air conditioner systems.

====Rating (SEER) ====
Air conditioners are usually rated of their efficiency by a system called the SEER ( Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio)  rating system.  A unit's SEER is calculated by dividing the total number of BTUs of heat removed from the air by the total amount of energy required by the unit. The higher the ratio, the more efficient the unit.

This system rates compressors and condensers on a scale from 1-15, based on their relative efficiency. Today, it is rare to locate any units that are rated below SEER 9, as people are becoming more and more attracted towards the higher efficiency units. An upgrade to a SEER 13 unit, from a SEER 9 system will usually propagate savings of around $300 per year, depending on your location (Compressors , and heat pumps that are used in AC's and Heaters usually work best at temperatures around 50-55 (best in the midwest); at temperatures below 40 Fahrenheit, they begin to reach a point called the balance point, where the unit just cannot pull any more heat out from the air; same around 120 degrees, when relatives outdoor coolness begins to exponentially drop). A common misconception held by people on the SEER rating system is that that it also applies to heating efficiency. This however is not true, as SEER rating testing is done only on Air Conditioning.

== Types of air conditioning == 
=== Refrigeration cycle ===
[[Image:Heatpump.svg|thumb|300px|A diagram of the refrigeration cycle: 1)&amp;nbsp;condensing coil, 2)&amp;nbsp;expansion valve, 3)&amp;nbsp;evaporator coil, 4)&amp;nbsp;compressor.]]

In the [[refrigeration cycle]], a [[heat pump]] transfers heat from a lower temperature heat source into a higher temperature heat sink. Heat would naturally flow in the opposite direction. This is the most common type of air conditioning. 
A refrigerator works in much the same way, as it pumps the heat out of the interior into the room in which it stands.

This cycle takes advantage of the [[universal gas law]] ''PV'' = ''nRT'', where ''P'' is pressure, ''V'' is volume, ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]], ''T'' is temperature, and ''n'' is the number of moles of gas (1 mole = 6.022×10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; molecules).

The most common refrigeration cycle uses an electric motor to drive a [[gas compressor|compressor]]. In an automobile the compressor is driven by a [[pulley]] on the engine's [[crankshaft]], with both using electric motors for air circulation. Since [[evaporation]] occurs when [[heat]] is absorbed, and [[condensation]] occurs when heat is released, air conditioners are designed to use a compressor to cause pressure changes between two compartments, and actively pump a refrigerant around. A refrigerant is pumped into the cooled compartment (the evaporator coil), where the low pressure and load temperature cause the refrigerant to evaporate into a vapour, taking heat with it. In the other compartment (the condenser), the refrigerant vapour is compressed and forced through another heat exchange coil, condensing into a liquid, rejecting the heat previously absorbed from the cooled space.

==== Humidity ====
Refrigeration air conditioning equipment usually reduces the [[humidity]] of the air processed by the system. The relatively cold (below the [[dewpoint]]) evaporator coil condenses water vapor from the processed air, (much like an ice cold drink will condense water on the outside of a glass), sending the water to a drain and removing water vapor from the cooled space and lowering the relative humidity. Since humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the [[evaporation]] of perspiration from the skin, drier air (up to a point) improves the comfort provided. The comfort air conditioner is designed to create a 40% to 60% relative humidity in the occupied space. In food retailing establishments large open chiller cabinets act as highly effective air dehumidifing units.

==== Refrigerants ====
&quot;[[Freon]]&quot; is a trade name for a family of fluorocarbon [[refrigerants]] manufactured by [[DuPont]] and other companies. These refrigerants were commonly used due to their superior stability and safety properties. Unfortunately, evidence has accumulated that these chlorine bearing refrigerants reach the upper atmosphere when they escape. The chemistry is poorly understood but general consensus seems to be that CFCs break up in the [[stratosphere]] due to [[UV]]-radiation, releasing their chlorine atoms. These chlorine atoms act as [[catalyst]]s in the breakdown of ozone, which does severe damage to the [[ozone layer]] that shields the Earth's surface from the strong UV radiation. The chlorine will remain active as a catalyst until and unless it binds with another particle forming a stable molecule. CFC refrigerants in common but receding usage include R-11 and R-12. Newer and more environmentally-safe refrigerants include HCFCs (R-22, used in most homes today) and HFCs (R-134a, used in most cars) have replaced most CFC use.

=== Evaporation coolers ===
The aforementioned Persian cooling systems were evaporation coolers. In very dry climates, such affectionately called &quot;[[swamp cooler|swamp coolers]]&quot; are popular for improving comfort during hot [[weather]]. The evaporative cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad. The [[sensible heat]] of the incoming air, as measured by a [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry bulb thermometer]], is reduced. The total heat ([[sensible heat]] plus [[latent heat]]) of the entering air is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite comfortable. These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain. 

An early type of cooler, using ice for a further effect, was patented by [[John Gorrie]] of [[Apalachicola]], FL in 1842, who used the device to cool the patients of his malaria hospital.  

A three-stage absorptive cooler exists that first dehumidifies the air with a spray of salt brine.  The brine [[osmosis|osmotically]] absorbs water vapor from the air.  The second stage sprays water in the air, evaporatively cooling (via [[absorptive refrigeration]]) the air.  Finally, to control the humidity, the air passes through another brine spray.  The brine is reconcentrated by distillation.  The system is used in some hospitals because, with filtering, a sufficiently hot regenerative distillation controls airborne organisms.

=== Absorptive chillers ===
Some buildings use gas turbines to generate electricity.  The exhausts of these are hot enough to drive an [[absorptive chiller]] that produces cold water.  The cold water is then run through radiators in air ducts for hydronic cooling.  The dual use of the energy, both to generate electricity and cooling, makes this technology attractive when regional utility and fuel prices are right. Producing heat, power, and cooling in one system is known as [[trigeneration]].

== Power ==
Air conditioner equipment power in the [[United States|U.S.]] is often described in terms of &quot;tons of refrigeration&quot;. A &quot;ton of refrigeration&quot; is defined as the cooling power of one [[short ton]]  (2000 [[pound (mass)|pound]]s or 907 [[kilogram]]s) of [[ice]] melting in a 24-hour period. This is equal to 12,000 [[BTU]] per [[hour]], or 3510 [[watt]]s (http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html). Residential &quot;[[Central air conditioning|central air]]&quot; systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3 to 20 kW) in capacity.

The use of electric/compressive air conditioning puts a major demand on the nation's [[electrical power grid]] in warm weather, when most units are operating under heavy load. In the aftermath of the [[2003 North America blackout]] locals were asked to keep their air conditioning off. During peak demand, additional [[power plant]]s must often be brought online, usually [[natural gas]] fired plants because of their rapid startup. A [[1995]] study of various utility studies of residential air conditioning concluded that the average air conditioner wasted 40% of the input energy. This energy is lost, ironically, in the form of heat, which must be pumped out. There is a huge opportunity to reduce the need for new power plants and to conserve energy.

In an automobile the A/C system will use around 5 [[horsepower|hp]] (4 kW) of the engine's [[power (physics)|power]].

== Insulation ==
[[thermal insulation|Insulation]] reduces the required power of the air conditioning system. Thick walls, reflective roofing material, curtains and trees next to building also cut down on system and energy requirements.

== Home air conditioning systems around the world ==
Domestic air conditioning is most prevalent and ubiquitous in the first-world nations of East Asia ([[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], etc.). In this area, with soaring summer temperatures and a relatively high standard of living, air conditioning is considered a necessity and not a luxury. Japanese-made domestic air conditioners are usually window or split types, the latter being more modern and expensive.

In the United States, home air conditioning is more prevalent in the South and on the East Coast, in some parts of which it has reached the ubiquity it enjoys in East Asia.  Central air systems are most common in the United States, and are virtually standard in all new dwellings in the state of [[Florida]].

In Europe, home air conditioning remains a rarity, and this lack is largely responsible for the estimated 35000 deaths left in the wake of the [[European Heat Wave of 2003|2003 heat wave]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ATA cables.jpg|right|thumb|ATA cables: 40 wire ribbon cable top, 80 wire ribbon cable bottom]]
'''Advanced Technology Attachment''' ('''ATA''') is a standard [[Electrical connector|interface]] for connecting [[computer storage | storage]] devices such as [[hard disk]]s and [[CD-ROM]] drives inside [[personal computer]]s.  Many terms and synonyms for ATA exist, including abbreviations such as '''IDE''', '''ATAPI''', and '''UDMA'''.

With the market introduction of [[Serial ATA]] in 2003, the original ATA was [[retronym|retroactively renamed]] '''Parallel ATA''' (PATA). In line with the original naming, this article only covers Parallel ATA.

Parallel ATA standards only allow cable lengths up to 18 inches (up to 450 mm) although cables up to 36 inches (900 mm) can be readily purchased.  Because of this length limit, the technology normally appears as an internal computer storage interface.  It provides the most common and the least expensive interface for this application.

== History ==
[[Image:ATA on mainboard.jpg|right|thumb|Image:ATA on mainboard.jpg|ATA connection sockets on a PC motherboard located below RAM sockets]]
Although the standard has always had the official name &quot;ATA&quot;, marketing dictates caused an early version to be dubbed '''Integrated Drive Electronics''' ('''IDE''').  This is due to the drive controller being contained on the drive itself as opposed to a separate controller connected to the motherboard.  The standard following IDE, '''Enhanced IDE''' ('''EIDE''') allowed the support of drives having a storage capacity larger than 504 [[mebibyte]]s, up to 8.4 gigabytes.  Although these new names originated in branding convention and not as an official standard, the terms '''IDE''' and '''EIDE''' often appear as if interchangeable with '''ATA'''.  This may be attributed to the two technologies being introduced with the same consumable devices, these &quot;new&quot; ATA hard drives.  With the introduction of [[Serial ATA]] around 2003, conventional ATA was retroactively renamed to '''Parallel ATA''' ('''P-ATA'''), referring to the method in which data travels over wires in this [[Electrical connector|interface]].

The interface at first only worked with hard disks, but eventually an extended standard came to work with a variety of other devices&amp;mdash;generally those using removable media.  Principally, these devices include [[CD-ROM]] and [[DVD-ROM]] drives, [[tape drive]]s, and large-capacity [[floppy disk | floppy]] drives such as the [[Zip drive]] and [[SuperDisk drive]].  The extension bears the name '''Advanced Technology Attachment Packet Interface''' ('''ATAPI'''), with the full standard now known as '''ATA/ATAPI'''.

The movement from [[programmed input/output]] (PIO) to [[direct memory access]] (DMA) provided another important transition in the history of ATA. As every computer word must be read by the CPU individually, PIO tends to be slow and use a lot of CPU. This is especially a problem on faster CPUs where accessing an address outside of the cacheable main memory (whether in the [[I/O]] map or the memory map) is a relatively expensive process. This meant that systems based around ATA devices generally performed disk-related activities much more slowly than computers using [[SCSI]] or other interfaces.  However, DMA (and later '''Ultra DMA''', or '''UDMA''') greatly reduced the amount of processing time the CPU had to use in order to read and write the disks. This is possible because DMA and UDMA allow the disk controller to write data to memory directly, thus bypassing the CPU.

ATA devices have suffered from a number of &quot;barriers&quot; in terms of how much data they can handle.  However, new addressing systems and programming techniques have broken most of these barriers.  Some of the ATA-specific barriers included: 504 [[MiB]], ~8 [[GiB]], ~32 GiB&lt;!--what exactly caused this one?--&gt;, and 128 [[GiB]].  A variety of other barriers have existed, usually due to [[device driver]]s and disk I/O layers in [[operating system]]s that did not correspond with ATA standards.

The original ATA specification used a 28-bit addressing mode. This allows for the addressing of 268,435,456 512-byte sectors (128 [[GiB]] or 137 [[Gigabyte|GB]]). The standard PC BIOS system supported up to 7.88 GiB (8.46 GB), with maximum of 1024 cylinders, 256 heads and 63 sectors. &lt;!--details needed--&gt;Unfortunately, when the lowest common denominators of the [[Cylinder-head-sector|CHS]] limitations in the standard PC BIOS system and the IDE standard were combined, the system as a whole was left limited to a mere 504 [[mebibyte]]s. BIOS translation 
and [[Logical_block_addressing|LBA]] &lt;!--was LBA really introduced back then?--&gt;were introduced, removing the need for the CHS structure on the drive itself to match that used by the BIOS and consequently allowing up to 7.88 GiB. With time, this limitation was itself lifted and first 32 GB &lt;!--need some info on what caused this limit in the first place, was it just bad coding or were there historical reasons--&gt;and then the full 128 [[GB]] supported by ATA at that time became supported by PC BIOSes.

The newer specification allows 48-bit addressing, and this extends the limit to 128 [[Pebibyte|PiB]] (or 144 [[petabytes]]). Most operating systems have poor support for drives more than 2 [[TiB]] because that is the limit of their current file system, so it can be expected that will be the next drive size barrier in the near future.

These size limitations come about because some part of the system is unable to deal with block addresses above some limit. This problem may manifest itself by the system thinking the size of a drive is only the limit value, or by the system refusing to boot and hanging on the BIOS screen at the point when drives are initialised. In some cases, a BIOS upgrade for the motherboard will resolve the problem. This problem is also found in older external [[FireWire]] disk enclosures, which limit the usable size of a disk to 128GB.  By early 2005 most enclosures available have practically no limit. (Earlier versions of the popular Oxford 911 FireWire chipset had this problem. Later Oxford 911 versions and all Oxford 922 chips resolve the problem.)

== Parallel ATA Interface ==
[[Image:nappe.png|right|Ribbon cable with two connectors]]
[[Image:ATA Plug.PNG|right|40-pin connector schematic]]
Until the introduction of Serial ATA, 40-pin connectors generally attached drives to a [[ribbon cable]]. Each cable has two or three connectors, one of which plugs into a controller that interfaces with the rest of the computer system.  The remaining one or two connectors plug into drives.  Parallel ATA cables transfer data 16 bits at a time.  One occasionally finds cables that allow for the connection of three ATA devices onto one IDE channel, but in this case one drive remains read-only (this type of configuration virtually never occurs). &lt;!--how is that done then?--&gt;

ATA's ribbon cables had 40 wires for most of its history, but an 80-wire version appeared with the introduction of the ''Ultra DMA/66'' (''UDMA4'') mode.  All of the additional wires in the new cable are [[ground (electricity)|ground]] wires, interleaved with the previously defined wires. The interleaved ground wire reduces the effects of [[capacitive coupling]] between neighboring signal wires, thereby reducing [[crosstalk]].  Capacitive coupling is more of a problem at higher transfer rates, and this change was necessary to enable the 66 megabytes per second (MB/s) transfer rate of ''UDMA4'' to work reliably.  The faster ''UDMA5'' and ''UDMA6'' modes also require 80-conductor cables.  

Though the number of wires doubled, the number of connector pins and the pinout remain the same as on 40-conductor cables, and the external appearance of the connectors is identical. Internally, of course, the connectors are different: The connectors for the 80-wire cable connect a larger number of ground wires to a smaller number of ground pins, while the connectors for the 40-wire cable connect ground wires to ground pins one-for-one. 

The ATA standard has always specified a maximum cable length of just 46 cm (18 inches). This can cause difficulties in connecting drives within a large computer case, or when mounting several physical drives into one computer, and it all but completely eliminates the possibility of using parallel ATA for external devices.  Although longer cables are widely available on the market, it must be understood that they are outside the parameters set by the specifications.  The same is true of the &quot;rounded&quot; cables also commonly available: The ATA standard describes flat cables with particular [[impedance]] and [[capacitance]]  characteristics. This is of course not a guarantee that other cables will not work, but an indication that nonstandard cables should be used, if at all, with caution.  

If two devices attach to a single cable, one is commonly referred to as a ''master'' and the other as a ''slave''.  The master drive generally appears first when the computer's [[bios]] and/or [[operating system]] enumerates available drives. On old BIOSes (486 era and older) the drives are often misleadingly referred to by the bios as &quot;C&quot; for the master and &quot;D&quot; for the slave.

If there is a single device on a cable, in most cases it should be configured as ''master''.  However, some hard drives have a special setting called ''single'' for this configuration ([[Western Digital]], in particular).  Also, depending on the hardware and software available, a single drive on a cable can work reliably even though configured as the ''slave'' drive (this configuration is most often seen when a CDROM has a channel to itself).

A drive setting called ''[[cable select]]'' was described as optional in ATA-1 and has come into fairly widespread use with ATA-5 and later.  A drive set to &quot;cable select&quot; automatically configures itself as master or slave, according to its position on the cable.  Cable select is controlled by pin 28. The host controller grounds this pin; if a device sees that the pin is grounded, it becomes the master device; if it sees that pin 28 is open, the device becomes the slave device.  

With the 40-wire cable it was very common to implement cable select by simply cutting this wire between the two device connectors.  This puts the slave device at the end of the cable, and the master on the &quot;middle&quot; connector.  This arrangement eventually was standardized in later versions of the specification.  Unfortunately, if there is just one device on the cable, this results in an unused &quot;stub&quot; of cable.  This is undesirable, both for physical convenience and electrical reasons:  The stub causes [[signal reflections]], particularly at higher transfer rates. 

When the 80-wire cable was defined for use with UDMA4, these details were changed.  The master device now goes at the end of the cable, so if there is only one device on the cable, there is no cable &quot;stub&quot; to cause reflections.   Also, cable select is now implemented in the slave device connector, usually simply by omitting the contact from the connector body.  Since 80-wire cables require special connectors anyway, this was a small additional effort.  The standard also dictates color-coded connectors for easy indentification by both installer and cable maker.

Although they are in extremely common use, the terms ''master'' and ''slave'' do not actually appear in current versions of the ATA specifications.  The two devices are correctly referred to as ''device 0'' (master) and ''device 1'' (slave), respectively.  It is a common myth that &quot;the master drive arbitrates access to devices on the channel.&quot;  In fact, the drivers in the host operating system perform the necessary arbitration and serialization. If device 1 is busy with a command then device 0 cannot start a command until device 1's command is complete, and vice versa.  There is therefore no suggestion in the ATA protocols that one device has to ask the other if it can use the channel.  Both are really &quot;slaves&quot; to the driver in the host OS.

==ATA standards versions, transfer rates, and features==
The following table shows the names of the versions of the ATA standards and the transfer modes and rates supported by each. Note that the transfer rate for each mode (for example, 66.7 MB/sec for UDMA4, commonly called &quot;Ultra-DMA 66&quot;) gives its maximum theoretical transfer rate on the cable. This is simply two bytes multiplied by the effective clock rate, and presumes that every clock cycle is used to transfer end-user data. In practice, of course, protocol overhead reduces this value. 

Congestion on the  host bus to which the ATA controller is attached may also limit the maximum burst transfer rate. For example, the maximum data transfer rate for conventional [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus is 133 MB/sec, and this is shared among all active devices on the bus. 

In addition, [[as of October 2005]] no ATA [[hard drive]]s exist capable of measured sustained transfer rates of above 80 MB/sec. Furthermore, sustained transfer rate tests do not give realistic throughput expectations for most workloads: They use I/O loads specifically designed to encounter almost no delays from seek time or rotational latency. Hard drive performance under most workloads is limited first and second by those two factors; the transfer rate on the bus is a distant third in importance. Therefore, transfer speed limits above 66 MB/sec only really affect performance when the hard drive can satisfy all I/O requests by reading from its internal [[cache]] &amp;mdash; a very unusual situation, especially considering that such data is usually already buffered by the operating system.

In August 2004, Sam Hopkins and Brantley Coile of [[Coraid]] specified a lightweight protocol to carry ATA commands over [[Ethernet]] instead of directly connecting them to a PATA host controller.  This permitted the established block protocol to be reused in [[Network-attached storage]] applications.

The '''Atari 2600''', released in [[1977]], is the first successful [[video game console]] to use plug-in [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]]s instead of having [[dedicated console|one or more games built in]].{{ref|plug-in-carts}} Originally known as the '''Atari VCS'''&amp;mdash;for '''''V'''ideo '''C'''omputer '''S'''ystem''&amp;mdash;the machine's name was changed to &quot;Atari 2600&quot; (from the unit's Atari part number, CX2600) in [[1982]], after the release of the more advanced [[Atari 5200]]. It was wildly successful, and during the [[1980s]],  &quot;Atari&quot; was a synonym for this model in mainstream media.  The 2600 was typically bundled with two [[joystick]] [[game controller|controllers]], a conjoined pair of [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]] controllers, and a cartridge game.


== History ==

=== Development and market considerations ===
[[Atari]] had spun off an engineering think-tank in 1975 called Cyan Engineering to research next-generation video game systems, and had been working on a prototype known as &quot;Stella&quot; (named after one of the engineers' bicycles) for some time. Unlike prior generations of machines which used custom [[Logic programming|logic]] to play a small number of games, Stella's core was a complete [[Central processing unit|CPU]], the famous [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] in a cost-reduced version, known as the [[MOS Technology 6507|6507]]. It was combined with a display and sound chip of their own design known as the '''[[Television Interface Adapter|TIA]]''', for '''''T'''elevision '''I'''nterface '''A'''daptor''. At first the design was not going to be cartridge-based, but after seeing a &quot;fake&quot; cartridge system on another machine they realized they could place the games on cartridges essentially for the price of the connector and packaging.

In August 1976 [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] released their own cartridge-based system, the [[Channel F]]. Stella was still not ready for production, but it was clear that it needed to be before there were a number of &quot;me too&quot; products filling up the market &amp;ndash; which had happened after they invented [[PONG]]. Atari simply didn't have the cash flow to complete the system quickly, given that sales of their own PONG systems were cooling. [[Nolan Bushnell]] eventually turned to [[Time Warner|Warner Communications]], and sold the company to them in [[1976]] for $28 million on the promise that Stella would be produced as soon as possible.

Key to the eventual success of the machine was the hiring of [[Jay Miner]], a chip designer who managed to squeeze an entire [[breadboard]] of equipment making up the TIA into a single chip. Once that was completed and debugged the system was ready for shipping. 
By the time it was released in [[1977]], the development had cost about US$100 million.

=== Launch and runaway success ===

The initial price was $199 with a library of 9 titles. In a play to compete directly with the Channel F, Atari named the machine the Video Computer System (or VCS for short), as the Channel F was at that point known as the '''VES''', for ''Video Entertainment System''. When Fairchild learned of Atari's naming they quickly changed the name of their system to become the Channel F. However both systems were now in the midst of a vicious round of price-cutting: PONG clones made obsolete by these newer and more powerful machines sold off their boxes to discounters for ever-lower prices. Soon many of the clone companies were out of business, and both Fairchild and Atari were selling to a public that was completely burnt out on PONG. In 1977 Atari sold only 250,000 VCSs.  In 1978 only 550,000 units from a production run of 800,000 were sold, requiring further financial support from Warner to cover losses. This led directly to the disagreements that caused Atari founder [[Nolan Bushnell]] to leave the company in [[1978]].

Once the public realized it was possible to play video games other than PONG, and programmers learned how to push its hardware's capabilities, the 2600 gained popularity. Fairchild had by this point given up, thinking they were a passed fad, thereby handing the entire quickly growing market to Atari. By [[1979]], the 2600 was the best selling [[Christmas]] present (and console), mainly because of its exclusive content, and a million were sold that year.

[[Image:A2600_Space_Invaders.png|thumb|225px|Atari 2600 ''[[Space Invaders]]'' (1980).]]
The 2600 was also rebadged as the '''Sears Video Arcade''' and sold through [[Sears|Sears-Roebuck]] stores.  

Atari then licensed the smash [[video arcade|arcade]] hit ''[[Space Invaders]]'' by [[Taito Corporation|Taito]], which greatly increased the unit's popularity when it was released in May [[1980]], doubling sales again to over 2 million units. The 2600 and its cartridges were the main factor behind Atari grossing more than $2 billion in profits in 1980. Sales then doubled again for the next two years, with almost 8 million units selling in 1982.

During this period, Atari expanded the 2600 family with two other compatible consoles.  They designed the [[Atari 2700]], a wireless version of the console that was never released due to a design flaw.  The company also built a sleeker version of the machine dubbed the [[Atari 2800]] to sell directly to the [[Japan|Japanese]] market in early [[1983]], but it suffered from competition with the newly-released [[Nintendo]] [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]].

=== Growing pains and decline ===

During this period Atari continued to grow until it had one of the largest [[research and development|R&amp;D]] divisions in [[Silicon Valley]]. They spent much of their R&amp;D budget on projects that seemed rather out of place at a videogame (or even home computer) company, projects many of which never saw the light of day. Meanwhile several attempts to bring out newer consoles failed for one reason or another, although their [[home computer]] systems, the [[Atari 8-bit family]] sold reasonably if not spectacularly. Warner was more than happy anyway, as it seemed to have no end to the sales of the 2600, and Atari was responsible for over half of the company's income. 

[[Image:PacManCrt260007052004.jpg|thumbnail|left|2600 Pac Man cartridge]]
The programmers of many of Atari's biggest hits grew disgruntled with the company for not crediting game developers. For example, Rick Mauer, the programmer of Atari 2600 ''[[Space Invaders]]'', received no credit and made only $11,000 for his efforts, in spite of the cartridge grossing more than $100 million in sales. Most notably, Warren Robinett, the lead programmer of ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'', in protest against Atari's anonymity policy, hid his name in a secret room within the game.  This was the very first &quot;[[easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]]&quot;&amp;mdash;a hidden treat or in-joke&amp;mdash;a practice which continues in software development to this day. Many other programmers left the company and formed their own independent software companies. The most prominent and longest-lasting of these third-party developers was [[Activision]], founded in 1980, whose titles quickly became more popular than those of Atari itself. Atari attempted to block third-party development for the 2600 in court but failed, and soon other publishers, such as [[Imagic]] and [[Coleco]], entered the market.  Atari suffered from an image problem when a company named [[Mystique (company)|Mystique]] produced a number of [[pornographic]] games for the 2600.  The most notorious of these, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'', caused a large number of protests from women's and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups.  Atari sued Mystique in court over the release of the game.

Atari continued to scoop up licenses during the shelf life of the 2600, the most prominent of which included ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[E.T. (video game)|E.T.]]'' Public disappointment with these two titles and the market saturation of bad third-party titles are cited as big reasons for the [[video game crash of 1983]]. Suddenly Atari's growth meant it was losing massive amounts of money during the crash, at one point about $10,000 a day. Warner quickly grew tired of supporting the now-headless company, and started looking for buyers in [[1984]].

=== The console that refused to die ===

[[Image:atari_2600_2.jpeg|thumb|225px|right|Atari 2600 in its 1986 cost-reduced version, also known as the &quot;2600 Jr.&quot;]]
Although not formally discontinued, the 2600 was de-emphasized for two years after Warner's 1984 sale of Atari to [[Commodore Business Machines]] founder [[Jack Tramiel]], who wanted to concentrate on [[home computer]]s. In [[1986]] a new version of the 2600 was released (although it was planned for release two years earlier). The new redesigned version of the 2600, unofficially referred to as the 2600 Jr., featured a smaller cost-reduced form factor with a modernized [[Atari 7800]]-like appearance. The redesigned 2600 was advertised as a budget gaming system (under $50)  that had the ability to run a large collection of classic games. With its introduction came a resurgence in software development both from Atari and from third parties. The Atari 2600 continued to sell in the USA and Europe until [[1990]], and continued to sell in [[PAL]] version in Asian nations until the early 1990s. Over its lifetime, an estimated 25 million units were shipped, and its [[List of Atari 2600 games|video game library]] reportedly numbers more than 900 titles.

At the turn of the millennium, 25 years+ after the launch of the Atari 2600, new [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew games]] for the system are still made and sold by hobbyists, several new titles are available each year, and the console and its old and new games are very popular with collectors because of its significant impact on video game and consumer electronics history and also due to its nostalgic value for many people. In addition, modern Atari 2600 clones remain on the market. One example is the Atari Classics 10-in-1 TV Game, manufactured by [[Jakks Pacific]], which simulates the 2600 console with an NES on a Chip, and includes converted versions of 10 games, into a single Atari-brand-look-a-like joystick with [[composite video]] outputs for connecting directly to modern televisions or VCRs. Another is the [[TV Boy]] which includes 127 games in an enlarged joypad.

Additionally, [[Benjamin Heckendorn]] has created several different versions of a portable 2600, created by cutting apart full-sized vintage units, adding screens and putting them into new enclosures.

==Description==

[[Image:2600IntCartridgeChip07052004.jpg|thumb|right|2600 game cartridge innards: basically a [[printed circuit board|circuit board]] with a [[read-only memory|ROM]] chip (center) and dual-sided 24-pin [[edge connector]] (bottom).]]
The basic layout of the 2600 is fairly similar to most consoles and home computers of the era. The CPU was the [[MOS Technology 6507]], a cut-down version of the 6502, running at 1.19 [[megahertz|MHz]] in the 2600.  The 6507 included fewer memory address pins &amp;mdash; 13 instead of 16 &amp;mdash; and no external interrupts to fit into a smaller 28-pin package.  Smaller packaging was, and still is, an important factor in overall system cost, and since memory was very expensive at the time, the 6507's small 8&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of maximum external memory space wasn't going to be used up anyway. In fact memory was so expensive they couldn't imagine using up even 4K, and when they got a deal on 24-pin connectors for the cartridge socket, they were only too happy to thereby limit the games to 4K.{{ref|cartridge-socket}} Later games got around this limitation with [[bank switching]].

The console had only 128 [[byte]]s of [[random-access memory|RAM]] for [[runtime]] data that included the [[call stack]] and the state of the game world. There was no [[frame buffer]], as the necessary RAM would have been too expensive. Instead the video device had two [[bitmap]]ped [[sprite (graphics)|sprites]], two one-line &quot;missile&quot; sprites, a one-pixel &quot;ball,&quot; and a &quot;playfield&quot; that was drawn by writing a bit pattern for each line into a register just before the television scanned that line. As each line was scanned, a game had to identify the non-sprite objects that overlapped the next line, assemble the appropriate bit patterns to draw for those objects, and write the pattern into the register. By default the right side of the screen was a duplicate of the left; to control it separately, the software had to modify the patterns as the scan line was drawn. After the controller scannd the last active line, a more leisurely [[vertical blanking interval]] began, during which the game could process input and update the positions and states of objects in the world. Any mistake in timing produced visual artifacts, a problem programmers called ''racing the beam''.

The video hardware gave the 2600 a reputation as one of the most complex machines in the world to program, but those programmers who understood it realized that such direct control over the video picture was also a source of flexibility. For example, although each sprite nominally had only one color, it was possible to color the rows differently by changing the sprite's color as it was drawn. If the five hardware sprites were not enough for a game, a developer could share one sprite among several objects (as with the ghosts in ''Pac-Man'') or draw software sprites, which was only a little more difficult than drawing a fixed playfield. The ''Pitfall!'' screen shot below demonstrates some of these tricks: the player is a multi-color sprite, one sprite is multiplexed for the logs and the scorpion, and the swinging vine is drawn by software. Despite the hardware limitations, many Atari 2600 games had a lot of action on the screen, creating an engaging experience.

** Six switches (original version): Power on/off, TV signal (B/W or Color), Difficulty for each player (called A and B), Select, and Reset. Except for the power switch, games could (and did) assign other meanings to the switches. On later models the difficulty switches were miniaturized and moved to the back of the unit.
* Output: [[RF modulator|B/W or Color TV]] picture and sound signal through [[RCA connector]] ([[NTSC]], [[PAL]] or [[SECAM]], depending on region; game cartridges are exchangeable between [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]]/[[SECAM]] machines, but this will result to wrong or missing colors and often a rolling picture.)

* [[Gameline]] Master Module, a modem allowing downloads of games from an extensive catalog which could be playable for a limited amount of time.

==Notes==
# {{note|plug-in-carts}} The first game console to use exchangeable plug-in cartridges was the [[Fairchild Channel F]]; however, that machine did rather dismally in the market. Thus, the Atari 2600 was the console which made the plug-in concept popular among the game playing public.
# {{note|cartridge-socket}} The cartridge connector's 24 pins were allocated to one supply voltage line, two ground lines, 8 data lines, and 13 address lines. However, the uppermost address line was used as a so-called [[chip select]] for the cartridge's ROM chip, leaving only 12 address lines for the chip's game program. Thus, without special &quot;hardware tricks&quot; built into the cartridge, an Atari 2600 game could occupy a maximum address space of 4K.
# {{note|de9-ports}} The screwless [[DE-9 connector|DE-9]] controller ports subsequently became the mechanical/electrical [[de facto]] standard for game controllers in the 8-bit and early 16-bit era, and was used in most subsequent Atari and Commodore consoles and home computers, among many others.

The '''Atari 5200''' is a [[video game console]] introduced in [[1982]] by [[Atari]]. It was created to compete with the [[Mattel Intellivision]], but it also competed with the [[Colecovision]] shortly after the 5200's release.  In some ways, it was both technologically superior and more cost efficient than any console available at that time.

The Atari 5200 was in essence an [[Atari 400]] computer without a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]. This made for a powerful, proven design which Atari could quickly bring to market. The system featured many innovations like the first automatic TV switchbox, allowing it to automatically switch from regular TV viewing to the game system signal when the system was activated.

The initial release of the system featured four controller ports, where all other systems of the day had only two ports.  The system also featured a revolutionary new controller with an analog [[joystick]], numeric keypad, two fire buttons on both sides of the controller and game function keys for Start, Pause, and Reset. 

The unusual design of the analog joystick, which used a weak rubber sleeve, rather than springs, to provide centering, proved to be ungainly and unreliable, alienating many consumers. The joysticks quickly became the [[achilles heel]] of the system due to their combination of overly complex mechanical design with a very low cost internal flex circuit system.

The Atari 5200 also suffered from its software incompatibility with the [[Atari 2600]], though an adapter was later released in [[1983]] allowing it to play all [[Atari 2600]] games, using the more reliable controllers native to that system. At the time, the concept of upgrading obsolete video game systems for next-generation video game systems was foreign to most people (a quote from G4TV's &quot;[[Icons (TV series)|Icons]]&quot; : &quot;I've had the same record player for 25 years. I've had the same television for 25 years. Now you're telling me I have to trade in my old game system for this new game system?&quot;).

Another problem was the lack of attention that Atari gave to the console; most of its resources went to the already over-saturated Atari 2600. While the 5200 did garner a strong cult following with its library of high quality games, it faced an uphill battle competing with the [[Colecovision]]'s head start and a stuttering economy. But the question of which system was superior became moot. The CEOs of both companies became motivational speakers when the [[video game crash of 1983|game market crashed]] in 1983, killing off both systems in their prime.

In its prototype stage, the Atari 5200 was originally called the &quot;Atari Video System X (Advanced Video Computer System)&quot;, and it was code-named PAM (PAM stood for Personal Arcade Machine).

The '''Atari 7800''' is a [[video game console]] released by [[Atari]] in [[1986]] (a [[test market]] occurred in June 1984). The 7800 was designed to replace the unsuccessful [[Atari 5200]], and re-establish Atari's market supremacy against [[Intellivision]] and [[Colecovision]]. With this system, Atari addressed all the shortcomings of the Atari 5200: it had simple digital [[joystick]]s; it was almost fully backwards compatible with the [[Atari 2600]]; and it was affordable (it was originally priced at $140 USD).

==Summary==
The 7800 was the first game system from Atari which was designed by an outside company ([[General Computer Corporation|GCC]]) (future consoles designed outside the company were the [[Atari Lynx]] and the [[Atari Jaguar]]). The system was designed to be upgraded to a fully-fledged home computer—a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] was developed, and the keyboard had an expansion port (which was the SIO port from [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari's 8-bit computer line]]) for the addition of peripherals like [[disk drive]]s and [[computer printer|printer]]s. (This should not be taken to imply that this computer expansion would have allowed the 7800 to run programs designed for Atari's computers, as the two architectures were entirely different.)  GCC had also designed a 'high score cartridge,' a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-backed [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] cart designed for storing game scores. Atari manufactured none of these accessories, and after the initial production run they also eliminated the expansion port. In 1987, the [[Atari XEGS]] was released and it came with a [[light gun]], called the [[XG-1]]. The XG-1 was fully compatible with the 7800 and the 2600, and Atari released four games on the 7800 that utilized this peripheral.

The 7800 was test-marketed in [[southern California]] in June of 1984. One month later, [[Warner Communications]] sold Atari to [[Jack Tramiel]], who did not want to build a video game console. He pulled the plug on all projects related to video games and decided to focus on Atari's existing computer line in order to begin development of the new 16-bit computer line (which appeared as the [[Atari ST]]). The 7800 was re-introduced in winter [[1986]] after the success of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] proved that the [[Computer and video games|video game]] market was still viable.  Unfortunately, by the time the 7800 made it to market, the NES had 90% of the market cornered and the rival [[Sega Master System]] had most of what was left.

The 7800's technical superiority is still debated today. The architecture is essentially just an [[Atari 2600]] with a slightly better CPU and an advanced graphics chip (MARIA). While the system could handle far more moving objects on screen (up to 100) than any of its competitors, its audio capabilities were limited due to lack of board space. The designers allowed games (notably ports from the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400/800]] computer line) to include a [[Atari POKEY|POKEY]] audio chip in the cartridge. Only two games, [[Ballblazer]] and [[Commando (video game)|Commando]] used the POKEY chip. The 7800 was also more difficult to program than other systems available at the time, though this was tempered by the fact that many game programmers at the time were already well versed in the 2600.

== Aftermath ==
The 7800 faced the severe software drought that would become the mark of all Atari consoles sold after the [[video game crash of 1983|video game crash]]. Relatively few titles were released by Atari, many of them unpolished and lacking in features, or even games that already were in previous Atari systems. And there was virtually no effort by Atari to recruit [[video game developer|third party developers]], aside from a few titles from [[Absolute Entertainment|Absolute]], [[Activision]], and [[Froggo]].

The '''Atari Jaguar''' is a [[video game console]] introduced in November 1993 as a powerful next generation platform. It was infamously touted as the &quot;first 64-bit system&quot;. The system eventually wound up as a [[flop|commercial failure]] and prompted Atari to leave the hardware business. 

== History ==
Competing with [[Sega]] and [[Nintendo]]'s 16-[[bit]] consoles, the Jaguar was said to be 64-bit.  Back then, bit width was a big deal in the gaming industry, just as [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]]-pushing power is today.  The Jaguar did not work off of a solitary 64-bit [[central processing unit|processor]], but instead it had a collection of processors with bus widths ranging from 16 to 64 bits.  The bit width of the Jaguar is still a source of considerable debate today, but consensus exists among those who are familiar with the system hardware that, because Jaguar's main data bus and some of the processors are 64-bit, the entire system can be considered 64 bit. It would otherwise be considered a [[History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era)|32-bit console]].

Nonetheless, it was technically superior to the leading 16-bit consoles at the time.  Unfortunately, this last ditch effort by [[Atari]] to find room in the console market failed. A relatively small number of games were developed for the system, but Atari pulled the plug altogether in 1996.  The Jaguar was a [[Cult following|cult]] success, however, and many games were created by young independent developers.  Jaguar conventions are held to show off rare unfinished Jaguar games that never made it to the shelves. A development company named Songbird Productions still produces games available for sale on the commercial market.

The Atari Jaguar and the [[Atari Lynx]] were the last two [[Atari]] systems to be developed, but because Atari did not want any direct involvement in hardware production, they were produced by outside contractors. In 1990, [[Flare Technology]], a company formed by [[Martin Brennan]] and [[John Mathieson]] with Atari funding, said that not only could they make a console far superior to the [[Sega Genesis]] or the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], but they could also be cost-effective. Atari immediately agreed and the system was released in November 1993 for a sale price of $249.99, under a $500 million manufacturing deal with [[International Business Machines|IBM]].  The system was initially marketed only in the [[New York City]] and the [[San Francisco Bay]] areas.  A nationwide release followed in early 1994.  

The system was marketed under the slogan &quot;Do the Math&quot; (i.e. 32 bit + 32 bit = 64 bit), claiming superiority over competing 16-bit systems.  Initially, the system sold well, substantially outselling the highly hyped and publicized [[3DO_Interactive_Multiplayer|3DO]], which was also released during the holiday season of 1993. However, the system was eventually considered a failure, due to a perception of the Jaguar having poor games and an overall lack of software developed. The system was difficult to program for as the hardware had a large number of bugs, including one in the memory controller that stopped some of its processors executing code from the system RAM [http://slashdot.org/articles/00/03/02/1430232.shtml#1225535] [http://slashdot.org/articles/00/03/02/1430232.shtml#1225584]. 

The final nail in the coffin was the release of both the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation]] and the [[Sega]] [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]]. In an interview [http://strider.mjjprod.free.fr/toxic15/articles/tramiel.htm], Sam Tramiel, CEO of Atari, also touted that the Jaguar was much more powerful than the Saturn and a little weaker than the PlayStation.  He also predicted the price of the PlayStation to be $500 and said that any price from $250 to $300 would be dumping and that Atari would sue to block sales (they never did).  The baseless comments were selected as #3 in the [http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/index22.shtml Top 25 Dumbest Moments in Gaming].

In a last ditch effort to rescue the Jaguar, Atari tried to play down these two consoles by claiming the Jaguar was the only 64-bit system, causing some controversy. (Some contended that the Jaguar's two 64-bit &quot;processors&quot; were essentially nothing more than graphics accelerators; its [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] was only 32-bit and its [[Central processing unit|CPU]] was a 16-bit [[Motorola 68000|68000]].) This advertising push was futile, and production of the Jaguar stopped after Atari purchased [[JT Storage]] in a [[reverse takeover]].

Several peripherals were announced, such as a voice modem and [[Virtual reality|VR]] headset, but the only peripherals released were the [[Atari Jaguar CD]] drive and the JagLink, a simple two-console networking device. Working prototypes of some of the proposed future developments exist (some, such as the Jaguar Voice Modem, in relatively large quantities), and include fully-functional versions of the [[virtual reality|VR]] headset, with infrared head-tracking, and a stereo adaptor to allow connection of the Jaguar to a hi-fi system. See [[Loki (computer)|Loki]] and [[Konix Multisystem]] for early development.

After Atari was bought out by [[Hasbro Interactive]] in the late 1990s, Hasbro released the [[encryption]] coding to the Jaguar, finally opening the doors for enthusiasts and hobby programmers to make their own Jaguar games and software, similar to what has happened with another defunct game system, the [[Sega Dreamcast]]. Several game companies, including Telegames and Songbird Productions, have not only released previously unfinished materials from the Jaguar's past, but also several brand new titles to satisfy the system's cult following.

The '''Atari Lynx''' is [[Atari]]'s only [[handheld game console]], and the first such machine with a [[color]] display. The system is notable for its forward-looking features, advanced graphics, and [[ambidextrous]] format. The ''Lynx'' was released in [[1989]], the same year as [[Nintendo]]'s (monochromatic) [[Game Boy]].

==Features==
The Atari Lynx had several innovative features including it being the first color handheld, with a backlit display, a switchable right-handed/left-handed (upside down) configuration, and the ability to network with up to 17 other units via its &quot;ComLynx&quot; system (though most games would network eight or fewer players).

The Lynx was also the first gaming console with hardware support for zooming/distortion of [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], allowing fast pseudo-[[3D computer graphics|3D]] games with unrivaled quality at the time and a capacity for drawing filled polygons with limited CPU intervention.

The games were originally meant to be loaded from [[tape]], but it changed to using ROM, but the loading didn't change so the data had to be loaded from ROM to RAM before it could be used, thereby eating up memory and making the games slower than necessary.

The system was developed by [[Epyx]] as the &quot;Handy&quot; and completed in [[1987]], at which point Atari bought the rights to it. Atari changed the internal speaker and removed the thumb-stick on the control pad before releasing it as the Lynx two years later, initially retailing in the US at USD $189.95. The two creators of the system, [[RJ Mical]] and [[Dave Needle]], were also members of the [[Amiga]] design team and much to the frustration of Atari, the Amiga was used as the software development platform.

[[Image:Atarilynx.jpg|right|thumb|Atari Lynx II]]
In 1991, Atari relaunched the Lynx with new packaging, slightly improved hardware, and a new sleek look. The new system (referred within Atari as the &quot;Lynx II&quot;) featured rubber hand grips and a clearer backlit color screen with a power save option. It also replaced the monaural headphone jack of the original Lynx with one wired for stereo.

==Mistakes==
Though technologically superior to the Game Boy, Nintendo's marketing muscle, domination of 3rd party developers, and quality first party game releases (particularly ''[[Tetris]]'') meant the Lynx was soon marginalized. The Lynx also suffered from needing more batteries (six versus four in the original Game Boy) which managed to run down much faster. The more powerful CPU of the Lynx, plus its backlit screen, would drain a set of six AA batteries in only four hours (five to six hours in the Lynx II). The Lynx was also physically larger than it needed to be; Atari had followed the advice of focus groups who wanted a bigger unit because that gave them &quot;more&quot; for their money (much of the inside of the Lynx's housing was empty air). It also didn't help that the Lynx was sold at a substantially higher price than the Game Boy. By the mid-1990s, the Atari Lynx was no longer widely available.

The [[Sega Game Gear]] followed a similar formula to the Atari Lynx, and the Game Gear did fare somewhat better due to stronger marketing and better titles. At the same time, the Game Gear was also plagued by similar problems that hurt the Lynx; higher price, shorter battery life, larger size and the Game Boy's dominance of the portable video game market.

As with a lot of older consoles, there are a small group of devoted fans still creating and selling games for the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Hinduism_small}}
'''Ahimsa''' is a [[religion|religious]] concept which advocates [[non-violence]] and a respect for all [[life]]. ''Ahimsa'' (&amp;#2309;&amp;#2361;&amp;#2367;&amp;#2306;&amp;#2360;&amp;#2366; ahim&amp;#775;s&amp;#257;) is [[Sanskrit]] for avoidance of ''[[himsa]]'', or injury. It is interpreted most often as meaning peace and reverence toward all [[sentient]] beings. Ahimsa is the core of [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]]. Its first mention in Indian philosophy is found in the Hindu scriptures called the [[Upanishads]], the oldest dating about 800 BCE. Those who practice ahimsa are often [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]] or [[vegan|vegans]]. 

Ahimsa was introduced to the [[Western world|West]] by the [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Inspired by his actions, Western [[civil rights]] movements, led by such people as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], engaged in non-violent protests. The more recent popularity of [[yoga]] and [[meditation]] in the West has also served to introduce many westerners to ahimsa and other [[Hindu]] concepts. [[Nonviolent Communication]], developed by American Dr. [[Marshall Rosenberg]] and practiced and taught around the world, is inspired by Gandhi's example. 

== Ahimsa in Jainism ==

In [[Jainism]], the '''ahimsa-[[vrata]]''', or vow of ahimsa, is the first of the five '''mahavratas''', or great vows. All animal life, and most [[plant]] life, is considered [[sentience|sentient]].  Any action endangering such life, including [[agriculture]], [[violence]], animal sacrifice, drinking liquor, eating [[honey]], [[potato]]es or certain [[fruit]]s, and eating at night, is forbidden. Some Jains wear a [[cloth]] over their [[mouth]]s to avoid inhaling airborne life forms. 

The ethical code of Jainism is taken very seriously. Summarized in the Five Vows, they are followed by both lay people and monastics. These are: 

# non-injury (ahimsa) 
# non-lying (satya) 
# non-stealing (asteya) 
# non-possession (aparigrah) 
# chastity (brahmcharya)

The Jain conception of ahimsa involves three times three&amp;mdash;the three actions (''karanas'') of himsa in the three modes (''yogas'')&amp;mdash;observances:

Neither by action or by speech or by thought:
# do injury oneself (''krita'')
# cause injury to be done by others (''karita'') 
# approve injury done by others (''anumata'', ''mananat'', or ''anumodana'')

==Ahimsa in Hinduism==

=== Yoga ===
[[Yoga]] is one of the six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], and as codified by [[Patanjali|Maharishi Patanjali]] in the seminal work ''[[Yoga Sutra]]'', the foundation of [[ashtanga yoga|ashtanga]] and Raja Yoga, ahimsa is the first of the five '''yamas''', or eternal vows or restraints of yoga.

=== Gandhi ===

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] drew many of his concepts of truth, nobility and ethics from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and his personal love of Lord [[Rama]], a Hindu God. Gandhi's concept of life and ahimsa, which led to his concept of [[satyagraha]], or peaceful protest, primarily stem from his association with [[Hindu Philosophy|Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain philosophy]].

Quotations from Gandhi on the subject:

&lt;cite&gt;
:Nonviolence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man.
&lt;/cite&gt;

Literally speaking, ahimsa means non-violence towards life but it has much higher meaning. It means that you may not offend anybody; you may not harbor uncharitable thought, even in connection with those who consider your enemies. To one who follows this doctrine, there are no enemies. A man who believes in the efficacy of this doctrine finds in the ultimate stage, when he is about to reach the goal, the whole world at his feet. If you express your love&amp;mdash;''ahimsa''&amp;mdash;in such a manner that it impresses itself indelibly upon your so-called enemy, he must return that love.

:This doctrine tells us that we may guard the honor of those  under our charge by delivering our own lives into the hands of the man who would commit the sacrilege. And that requires far greater courage than delivering of blows.

Ahimsa or non-injury, of course, implies non-killing. But, non-injury is not merely non-killing. In its comprehensive meaning, ahimsa or non-injury means entire abstinence from causing any pain or harm whatsoever to any living creature, either by thought, word, or deed. Non-injury requires a harmless mind, mouth, and hand.
&lt;/cite&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''''Annals of Mathematics''''' (ISSN 0003-486X), often just called '''''Annals''''', is a bimonthly [[mathematics research journal]] published by [[Princeton University]] and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].  It ranks amongst the most prestigious mathematics journals in the world by criteria such as refereeing intensity.

It started out as ''The Analyst'' in 1874, but was discontinued in 1883 and renamed in 1884 under the new direction of [[Ormond Stone]] of the [[University of Virginia]].  It moved to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in [[1899]] before reaching its current home in Princeton in [[1911]].  

An important period for the journal was 1928-1958 with [[Solomon Lefschetz]] as editor.  During this time, ''Annals'' became an increasingly well-known and respected journal.  The rise of ''Annals'', in turn, stimulated American mathematics.

Princeton University continued to publish the ''Annals'' on its own until [[1933]], when the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] took joint editorial control.  Since [[1998]] it has been available in an electronic edition, alongside its regular print edition.

The current editors of the ''Annals of Mathematics'' are:
* [[Jean Bourgain]], Institute for Advanced Study

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Sakharov 1943.jpg|thumb|right|Andrei Sakharov, 1943]]

'''Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov''' ({{lang-ru|Андре́й Дми́триевич Са́харов}}, [[May 21]] [[1921]] &amp;ndash; [[December 14]] [[1989]]), was an eminent [[Russian SFSR|Soviet]] [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] [[physicist]], [[dissident]] and [[human rights]] activist. Sakharov was an advocate of [[civil liberties]] and reforms in the [[Soviet Union]].

==Life and career==
Born in [[Moscow]] in [[1921]], he entered [[Moscow State University]] in [[1938]]. Following evacuation in [[1941]] during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|&quot;Great Patriotic War&quot;]], he graduated in [[Ashkhabad]], in today's [[Turkmenistan]]. He was then assigned laboratory work in [[Ulyanovsk]]. He returned to Moscow in [[1945]] to study at the Theoretical Department of [[FIAN]] (the Physical Institute of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]]). He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[1947]].

[[Image:1958 Sakharov Kurchatov.jpg|thumb|Andrei Sakharov and [[Igor Kurchatov]], 1958]]
On [[World War II]]'s end, Sakharov researched [[cosmic ray]]s. In mid-1948 he participated in the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] under [[Igor Kurchatov]]. The first Soviet atomic device was tested on [[August 29]], [[1949]]. After moving to [[Sarov]] in 1950, Sakharov played a key role in the next stage, the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]]. The first Soviet device was tested on [[August 12]], [[1953]]. In 1953, he received his [[Doctor of Science|D.Sc.]] degree, was elected a full member of the [[Russian Academy of Science|Soviet Academy of Sciences]], and was awarded the first of his three [[Hero of Socialist Labor]] titles. Sakharov continued to work at Sarov, helping on the first genuine Soviet H-bombs, tested in 1955, and the 50MT '[[Tsar Bomba]]' of October 1961, the most powerful device ever exploded.

He also proposed an idea for a controlled [[nuclear fusion]] reactor, the [[tokamak]], that is still the basis for the majority of work in the area. Sakharov, in association with [[Igor Tamm]], proposed confining extremely hot ionized [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] by [[torus]] shaped [[magnetic field]]s for controlling [[thermonuclear fusion]]. This led to the development of the tokamak device.

Sakharov proposed the idea of [[induced gravity]] as an alternative theory of [[quantum gravity]].

===Turn to activism===
From the late-[[1950s]] Sakharov had become concerned about the moral and political implications of his work. Politically active during the [[1960s]], Sakharov was against [[nuclear proliferation]]. Pushing for the end of atmospheric tests, he played a role in the [[1963]] [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], signed in Moscow. In 1965 he returned to fundamental science and began working on [[cosmology]] but continued to oppose political discrimination.

|}

The major turn in Sakharov’s political evolution started in [[1967]], when [[anti-ballistic missile]] defense became a key issue in US–Soviet relations. In a secret detailed letter to the Soviet leadership of [[July 21]], [[1967]], Sakharov explains the need to &quot;''take the Americans at their word''&quot; and accept their proposal &quot;for a bilateral rejection by the USA and the Soviet Union of the development of antiballistic missile defense&quot;, because otherwise an arms race in this new technology would increase the likelihood of nuclear war. He also asked permission to publish his manuscript (accompanied the letter) in a newspaper to explain the tricky danger of this kind of defense. The government ignored his letter and refused to let him initiate a public discussion of ABM in the Soviet press.

In May [[1968]] he completed an essay, ''Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom'', where the anti-ballistic missile defense is featured as a major threat of world nuclear war. After this essay was circulated in [[samizdat]] and then published outside the Soviet Union, Sakharov was banned from all military-related research and Sakharov returned to FIAN to study fundamental theoretical physics. In [[1970]] he was one of the founders of the [[Moscow Human Rights Committee]] and came under increasing pressure from the regime. He married a fellow human rights activist, [[Yelena Bonner]], in 1972.

In [[1973]] he was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. He won the prize in [[1975]], although he was not allowed to leave the Soviet Union to collect it. His wife read his speech at the acceptance ceremony.

Sakharov's ideas on social development led him to put forward the principle of human rights as a new basis of all politics. In his works he declared that &quot;the principle 'what is not prohibited is allowed' should be understood literally&quot;, denying the importance and validity of all moral or cultural norms not codified in the laws. He was arrested on [[January 22]] [[1980]], following his public protests against the [[Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan]] in [[1979]] and was sent to [[internal exile]] to a city of [[Nizhny Novgorod| Gorky]], now [[Nizhny Novgorod]], a [[closed city]] that was inaccessible to foreign observers.

Between [[1980]] to [[1986]], Sakharov was kept under tight Soviet police surveillance. In his memoirs he mentions that their apartment in Gorky was repeatedly subjected to searches and heists. He remained isolated but unrepentant until December 1986 when he was allowed to return to Moscow as [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] initiated the policies of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]].

In 1988 Sakharov was given the International Humanist Award by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]].

He helped to initiate the first independent legal political organizations and became prominent in the Soviet Union's growing political opposition. In April 1989, Sakharov was elected to the new parliament, the [[Congress of People's Deputies|All-Union Congress of People's Deputies]] and co-led the democratic opposition.

Sakharov died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1989 at the age of 68, and was interred in the Vostryakovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.

==Influence==
The [[Sakharov Prize]], established in [[1985]] and awarded annually by the [[European Parliament]] for people and organizations dedicated to human rights and freedoms, was named in his honor.

===Popular fiction===
Sakharov and the &quot;Sakharov Drive&quot; were featured in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]''. One of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise-D]] shuttlecraft in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' was also named for him.

==Quotes==
* &quot;In this pamphlet, advanced for discussion by its readers, the author has set himself the goal to present, with the greatest conviction and frankness, two theses that are supported by many people in the world. These are:
*# The division of mankind threatens it with destruction… Only universal cooperation under conditions of intellectual freedom and the lofty moral ideals of socialism and labor, accompanied by the elimination of dogmatism and pressure of the concealed interests of ruling classes, will preserve civilization…
*# The second basic thesis is that intellectual freedom is essential to human society — freedom to obtain and distribute information, freedom for open-minded and unfearing debate and freedom from pressure by officialdom and prejudices. Such a trinity of freedom of thought is the only guarantee against an infection of people by mass myths, which, in the hands of treacherous hypocrites and demagogues, can be transformed into bloody dictatorship. Freedom of thought is the only guarantee of the feasibility of a scientific democratic approach to politics, economics and culture.&quot; (''Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom'', in ''[[The New York Times]], July 22, 1968) [http://www.aip.org/history/sakharov/essay.htm]

The UIS will have individual miniature-computer terminals, central control points for the flood of information, and communication channels incorporating thousands of artificial communications from satellites, cables, and laser lines. Even the partial realization of the UIS will profoundly affect every person, his leisure activities, and his intellectual and artistic development. …But the true historic role of the UIS will be to break down the barriers to the exchange of information among countries and people.&quot; (Saturday Review/World, August 24, 1974) [http://www.aip.org/history/sakharov/humrt.htm]

'''Astrobiology''' is an interdisciplinary field, combining aspects of [[astronomy]], [[biology]] and [[geology]], which is focused primarily on the study of the [[origin of life|origin]], distribution and [[evolution]] of life. It comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''astron'' = star, ''bios'' = life and ''logos'' = word/science), and is also known as '''exobiology''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''exo'' = out) or '''xenobiology''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''xenos'' = foreign).

Some major astrobiological research topics include:

* What is life?
* How did life arise on [[Earth]]?
* What kind of environments can life tolerate?
* How can we determine if life exists on other planets?

'''Exobiology''' and '''xenobiology''' are terms also found in [[science fiction]], although typically such terms refer to the speculative biology of an [[extraterrestrial]]. A xenobiologist is usually a human [[physician|doctor]] or [[biologist]] who is expert on the [[physiology]] of alien organisms and life forms.

== Overview ==

Although astrobiology is an emerging field, the question of whether [[life]] exists elsewhere in the [[universe]] is a [[verifiable]] hypothesis and thus a valid line of [[science|scientific]] enquiry. Astrobiology does not claim to be a pure scientific discipline in the sense of [[physics]] or [[biology]] but rather represents an effort by researchers in different disciplines to try and answer questions about life by drawing on knowledge of multiple scientific fields.

A particular focus of current astrobiology research is the search for life on [[Mars (planet)|Mars]]. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that Mars has previously had a considerable amount of [[water]] on its surface; water is considered to be an essential precursor to the development of life, although this has not been conclusively proven.

Missions specifically designed to search for life include the [[Viking program]] and [[Beagle 2]] probes, both directed to Mars. The Viking results were inconclusive and Beagle 2 failed to transmit from the surface and is assumed to have crashed. A future mission with a strong astrobiology role would have been the [[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]], designed to study the frozen moons of Jupiter&amp;mdash;some of which may have liquid water&amp;mdash;had it not been canceled.

=== Research Outcomes ===

[[As of 2006]], there is no definite evidence of extraterrestrial life.  However examination of [[ALH84001|meteorites]] from [[Antarctica]] which are thought to have originated from the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] have provided what some scientists believe to be microfossils of extraterrestrial life, although that interpretation of the evidence is still controversial. In 2004, the spectral signature of [[methane]] was detected in the martian atmosphere by both Earth-based telescopes as well as by the [[Mars Express]] probe. Methane has a relatively short [[half-life]] in the martian atmosphere, so there must be a recent source of it. Since one possible source, active volcanism, has thus far not been detected on Mars, this has led scientists to speculate that the source could be ([[microorganisms|microbial]]) life.

Missions to other planets (such as [[Beagle 2: Evolution]] to Mars and [[Cassini probe|Cassini]] to [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn's]] moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]) hope to further explore the possibilities of life on other [[planet]]s in our [[solar system]].

Secondary questions, such as the availability of suitable worlds and chemical precursors, have had much success.  The &quot;wobble method&quot; and transit method (see [[Extrasolar planet]]) have found that planets are more common than previously postulated, although usually different from our own.  It has been proposed that our solar system is of an aberrant layout, though another possibility is that current searches are biased toward non-Solar layouts.  Improved detection methods and increased observing time will undoubtedly discover more planetary systems, and possibly ones more like ours.

The progress of [[infrared astronomy]] and [[submillimetre astronomy]] has &quot;opened&quot; additional star  systems.  Infrared searches have detected belts of dust and asteroids around distant stars, underpinning the formation of planets.  Some infrared images purportedly contain direct images of planets, though this is disputed.  Infrared and submillimetre [[spectroscopy]] has identified a growing number of chemicals around stars which underpin the origin or maintenance of life.

== Methodology==

=== Narrowing the task ===

''Main article: [[Planetary habitability]]''

When looking for life in other planets, some simplifying assumptions are useful to reduce the size of the task of astrobiologists. One is to assume that the vast majority of life-forms in our galaxy are based on [[Carbon based life|carbon chemistries]], as are all life-forms on Earth. While it is possible that [[Alternative biochemistry|non carbon-based life]] exists, carbon is well known for the unusually wide variety of molecules that can be formed around it.

The presence of liquid water is also a useful assumption, as it is a common molecule and provides an excellent environment for the formation of complicated carbon-based molecules that could eventually lead to the emergence of life.  Some researchers posit environments of ammonia, or more likely water-ammonia mixtures.  These environments are considered suitable for carbon or noncarbon life, while opening more temperature ranges (and thus worlds) for life.

A third assumption is to focus on Sun-like stars. Very big stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life would not likely have time to evolve on planets orbiting them. Very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be tidally &quot;locked&quot; to the star.  Without a thick atmosphere, one side of the planet would be perpetually baked and the other perpetually frozen.  In 2005, the question was reopened, as the long lifetimes of [[red dwarf|red dwarves]] could allow some biology on planets with thick atmospheres.  This is significant, as red dwarves are extremely common.

About 10% of the stars in our galaxy are Sun-like, and there are about a thousand such stars within 100 light-years of our Sun. These stars would be useful primary targets for interstellar listening. However, we only know of one planet where life exists: our own. There is no way to know if any of the simplifying assumptions are correct.

=== The sciences of Astrobiology ===

==== Astronomy ====

Most astronomy-related astrobiological research falls into the category of [[extrasolar planet]] (exoplanet) detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth then it could also arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect 'Earth-like' exoplanets are under development, most notably [[NASA]]'s [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] (TPF) and [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]] programs. A number of less ambitious ground-based efforts are also underway (see [[exoplanet]]).

The goal of these missions is not only to detect Earth-sized planets but also to image them [[spectroscopy|spectroscopically]]. By examining planetary spectra it will be possible to determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and surface; given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory[http://vpl.ipac.caltech.edu] (VPL), is  using computer modelling to generate a wide variety of 'virtual' planets to see what they would look like if viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these 'virtual' planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life.

An estimate for the number of planets with (intelligent) extraterrestrial life can be gleaned from the [[Drake equation]], essentially an equation expressing the probability of intelligent life as the product of factors such as the fraction of planets that might be habitable and the fraction of planets on which life might arise. However, whilst the rationale behind the equation is sound, it is unlikely that the equation will be constrained to reasonable error limits any time soon. The first term, Number of Stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude.  The second and third terms, Stars with Planets and Planets with Habitable Conditions, are being evaluated for the Sun's neighborhood.  Another associated topic is the [[Fermi paradox]], which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the universe then there should be obvious signs of it. This is the purpose of project like [[SETI]], which tries to detect signs of radio transmissions from intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations.

Another active research area in astrobiology is [[solar system]] formation. It has been suggested that the peculiarities of our solar system (for example, the presence of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] as a protective 'shield' or the planetary collision which created the [[Moon]]) may have greatly increased the probability of intelligent life arising on our planet. No firm conclusions have been reached so far.

==== Biology ====

[[Extremophiles]] (organisms able to survive in extreme environments) are a core research element for astrobiologists. Such organisms include [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] able to survive kilometers below the ocean's surface near [[hydrothermal vent|hydrothermal vents]] and [[microbe|microbes]] that thrive in highly acidic environments. Characterization of these organisms&amp;mdash;their environments and their evolutionary pathways&amp;mdash;is considered a crucial component to understanding how life might evolve elsewhere in the universe.

The origin of life, as distinct from the evolution of life, is another ongoing field of research. [[Oparin]] and [[Haldane]] postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive to the formation of organic compounds from inorganic precursors and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as [[prebiotic chemistry]], has made some progress but it is still unclear whether or not life can have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative theory of [[panspermia]] is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favourable conditions, and then have been carried over to Earth by a variety of means.

==== Geology ====

The [[fossil record]] provides the oldest known evidence for life on Earth. By examining this evidence, geologists are able to better understand the types of organisms that arose on the early Earth. Some regions on Earth, such as the [[Pilbara]] in [[Western Australia]] are also considered to be geological analogs to regions of Mars and as such might be able to provide clues to possible [[Life on Mars|Martian life]].

== Criticisms ==

Like any emerging scientific field, astrobiology has had to struggle for respectability. While many scientists are enthusiastic about the broad questions involved, there remains concern as to whether astrobiology is distinct enough from its parent disciplines (particularly biology) to constitute a true science. Astrobiology is at present a largely speculative extrapolation of Earth conditions into off-Earth environments. Extremophiles, for example, ''may'' reveal how life has evolved in exotic locales throughout the universe, yet this remains unverified and the study of extremophiles is adequately covered under the rubric of biology. This ambivalent status is reflected by academic acceptance: those interested may specialize in astrobiology as a subset of an established science. Although some have thought a formal degree program in astrobiology unlikely[http://nai.arc.nasa.gov/astrobio/astrobio_detail.cfm?ID=477], the University of Glamorgan, UK, have started just such a degree this year.

Perhaps a more serious criticism of astrobiology is whether the very act of extrapolating from a single data source is unscientific. At best, this creates tautologies (&quot;Earth-like life will evolve under circumstances which are sufficiently Earth-like for a sufficient period of time&quot;) and at worst it may abrogate critical aspects of the [[scientific method]]. Characterization of non-Earth life is extraordinarily unsettled; hypotheses and predictions as to its existence and origin vary wildly; true astrobiological experiments (with modest exceptions such as the [[ALH84001]] meteorite) simply cannot occur at present. Finally, astrobiology has been criticized for being [[Evolving the Alien|unimaginative]] in the tacit assumption that Earth-like life presents the most likely template for life elsewhere.

[[Image:Atacama1.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Atacama]]

The '''Atacama''' [[desert]] of [[Chile]] and [[Peru]] is a virtually rainless [[plateau]] made up of [[salt]] basins (''salares''), sand, and [[lava]] flows, extending from the [[Andes]] mountains to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. 

The average width (east-and-west) is less than 160 kilometers (100 miles) but it extends from the [[Peru|Peruvian]] border 1000 kilometers (600 miles) south to the [[Bolivia]]n [[Altiplano]].  The mountains nearest to the ocean are the Pacific coastal range, with an average elevation of 800 meters (2500 feet). The [[Cordillera Domeyko]], a range of foothills of the [[Andes]] Mountains, lies east.

The Atacama Desert is the driest desert on [[Earth]] (except perhaps for the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] in [[Antarctica]]) and is virtually sterile because it is blocked from moisture on both sides by the Andes mountains and by coastal mountains. The average rainfall in [[Antofagasta (region)|Antofagasta]] &amp;mdash; a region in Chile which is part of the Atacama &amp;mdash; is just 3mm per year, and there was a period of time where no rain fell there for 40 years. The Atacama is 15 million years old and 50 times more arid than California's [[Death Valley]]. It is so arid, in fact, that mountains that reach as high as 6885 metres (22590 feet) are completely free of [[glacier]]s and, in the southern part from 25&amp;deg;S to 27&amp;deg;S, have possibly been glacier-free throughout the [[Quaternary]], though [[permafrost]] extends down to an altitude of 4400 metres and is continuous above 5600 metres. The Atacama north of 25&amp;deg;S is arid and receives very little rain. However many locations in the desert receive marine fog, providing sufficient moisture for hypolithic algae, lichens and even cacti. In the region south of Antofagasta the coastal range blocks the marine fog. The crest-line of the coastal range averages 3000 m for about 100 km south of Antofagasta. The driest part of the Atacama is between the coastal mountains and the [[Cordillera Domeyko]], an area called the 'double [[rain shadow]].' In this region, the Andes block moisture from the east, the [[Cordillera Domeyko]] block runoff from the Andes and the Coastal mountains block marine fog from the ocean. The region that is in the &quot;fog shadow&quot; of this high coastal crest-line is the region that contains the driest soils - the soil has been compared to that of Mars.

In 2003, a team of researchers published a report in [[Science magazine]] titled &quot;Mars-like Soils in the Atacama Desert, Chile, and the Dry Limit of Microbial Life&quot; in which they duplicated the tests used by the [[Viking 1]] and [[Viking 2]] [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] landers to detect life, and were unable to detect any signs in Atacama Desert soil. The region may be unique on Earth in this regard and is being used by NASA to test instruments for future Mars missions.  Alonso de Ercilla characterized it in ''La Araucana'', published in 1569: &quot;Towards Atacama, near the deserted coast, you see a land without men, where there is not a bird, not a beast, nor a tree, nor any vegetation&quot; (quoted Braudel 1984 p 388).

The Atacama has rich deposits of [[copper]] and other [[mineral]]s, and the world's largest natural supply of [[sodium nitrate]], which was mined on a large scale until the early [[1940s]]. The [[Atacama border dispute]] between Chile and Bolivia began in the 1800s over these resources.

The Atacama is inhabited, though sparsely populated. The [[Pan-American Highway]] runs through the Atacama. In an [[oasis]], in the middle of the desert, at an [[altitude]] of some 2000 meters, is the village of [[San Pedro de Atacama]]. Its [[church]] was built by the [[Spain|Spanish]] in [[1577]], but archeological evidence indicates that the San Pedro area was the center of a [[Paleolithic]] civilization that built rock fortresses on the steep mountains encircling the valley. The [[Escondida Mine]] and [[Chuquicamata]] are also located within the Atacama.The Atacama Desert of Chile is a sparsely populated virtually rainless plateau, running from the Pacific Ocean to the Andes Mountains. The average width is less than 100 miles but it extends 600 miles south from the Peruvian border. The mountains nearest the ocean are the Pacific coastal range, with an average elevation of 2500 feet. The Cordillera Domeyko, a range of foothills of the Andes Mountains, lies east. The Atacama is made up of salt basins (salars) sand and lava flows. The landscape is so desolate it is sometimes described as &quot;moon like&quot;. In fact the Atacama has been chosen as a good site to test the prototype of a future lunar rover.

The [[European Southern Observatory]] operates two major [[observatory|observatories]] in the Atacama desert:

* The [[La Silla Observatory]]
* The [[Paranal Observatory]], which includes the [[Very Large Telescope]].

An '''airshow''' is an event at which [[aviator]]s display their flying skills and the capabilities of their flying machines, normally to the public, but occasionally to selected invited guests, or employees and their families only. 

Many airshows are held for commercial motives, gaining income from onlookers or from companies hoping to sell [[aircraft]]. Others are held on military bases and are mostly paid for by recruiting budgets, and some are held to raise funds for charities. Usually they are arranged at [[airfield]]s in which case a variety of static aircraft and [[helicopter]]s might also be on view. Less often shows are held over the sea near coastal cities or resorts. Where space allows, other entertainments and market stalls may add to the attractions on offer at an airshow. 

The year's airshow schedule is usually defined during the end of the preceding year. The lineup of pilots and aircraft to be in attendance at each airshow is tentatively determined around February and March, but can change at any time. With a handful of exceptions (such as the mid-winter airshow at [[Marine Corps Air Station Yuma|MCAS Yuma]], AZ), the airshow &quot;season&quot; starts in early spring and ends around mid-fall (mid-autumn). Magazines aimed at aircraft enthusiasts will normally include a list of airshows in their February, March or April editions. Shows at military bases are liable to be cancelled or postponed during periods of international tension. 

Before the second world war, airshows were associated with long distance air races, often lasting many days and covering thousands of miles. While the [[Reno Air Races]] keep this tradition alive, most airshows today primarily feature a series of aerial demos of relatively short duration.

[[Germany]] remains the only nation to ban airshows as a result of a disaster involving an aircraft [[collision]] (See ''[[Ramstein airshow disaster]]'').

==Safety==
Airshows, while spectacular to watch, present an increased risk to both spectators and aviators. Accidents occur, sometimes with a large loss of life, such as the [[Ramstein airshow disaster|1988 disaster at Ramstein Air Base]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Sknyliv (Ukraine) airshow disaster|2002 airshow crash at Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]. Because of these accidents safety regulations govering airshows have become increasingly more defensive.

Airshows usually feature a series of aerial demonstrations that take place over the runway at an airfield, or over the water by a coastal city. At airshows held in US airfields, crowds are restricted from being within 500 feet of the runway, and some aircraft cannot fly within even larger distances of the crowd. While helicopters and slower aircraft may fly at 500 feet from the crowd, faster jets may be required to keep a 1500ft distance except during takeoffs, landings, and a few straight-line passes. Aircraft may only fly over the crowd or at less that 500ft distances if they are flying in a straight line or in a “banana pass”, where the aircraft starts out flying away from the crowd and turns towards the crowd, “cutting the corner” of the area where the crowd is allowed. (If the “banana pass” maneuver must be aborted or if control is lost, the energy of the aircraft will take in a line tangent to the turn, away from spectators).

[[image:frecce.tricolore.fairford.arp.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Frecce Tricolori aerobatics team of the Italian Air Force, flying at the Royal International Air Tattoo, Fairford, England, in 2005]]

Aerobatic maneuvers may only be performed if the aircraft are not heading towards the crowd. All aerobatic maneuvers must be performed inside the “airshow box”, a rectangular volume of space with the runway at one edge, extending behind the runway and up to a certain altitude over this area. No people are allowed in the airshow box except those assisting the pilot in his or her act (for examples, to hold poles the aircraft flies between, or to drive ground vehicles associated with the aerial act). This means any roads in the airshow box (such as a highway at one end of the airfield) may have to be closed.

During US airshows, helicopters cannot bank or pitch more than 90 degrees (an imaginary line going away from the helicopter perpendicular to the plane of the rotor cannot point below the horizon). Aerobatic pilots earn certificates that initially only allow them to perform aerobatics at higher altitudes, and only with more advanced certificates can all maneuvers be performed near the ground. Formation flying, as well as flying vintage or high-performance aircraft, also requires special training.

These safety restrictions make US airshows very safe. While accidents do happen, spectators are not injured if modern safety rules are followed. Mechanical malfunctions and pilot error (most often a combination of both) are responsible for a handful of airshow accidents every year, but even then, most pilots manage to eject safely or to survive their crashes.

==Attractions==
While some smaller airshows may display only general aviation aircraft, some aerobatic aircraft, and a [[warbird]] or two, most airshows will feature warbirds, aerobats, and demonstrations of modern military aircraft. Helicopter demos are less common, but most airshows will feature at least one helicopter on static display. While some airshows (&quot;Static&quot; airshows) feature primarily aircraft on the ground with the occasional fly-by, most airshows will have some flying being performed for almost the entire duration of the event.

[[Image:red.bull.air.race.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Air racing at an air show in England: the Red Bull Air Race heat held at Kemble airfield, Gloucestershire. The aircraft fly singly, and have to pass between pairs of pylons]]

Airshows usually open their gates very early, giving spectators a few hours to wonder around the static displays before flying starts in the late morning or early afternoon. Flying usually continues until late afternoon or early evening – later at some airshows, especially evening airshows which may go into the night. In evening airshows, airplanes fly which are especially lit, which release flares or fireworks or other pyrotechnics, or which have bright afterburners. While military installations will usually ask spectators to leave once the flying ends, most airshows that take place in non-military airfields do not. This allows for airshow fans and photographers to watch the aircraft on static display depart the airfield at the end of the day, and to photograph static-display aircraft and/or departing aircraft with sunset lighting, and with fewer people obstructing their shots.

Airplanes used in aerobatic demos have powerful piston engines, light weight, and big control surfaces, making them capable of very high roll rates and accelerations. A skilled pilot will be able to climb vertically, perform very tight turns, tumble his/her aircraft end-over-end, to perform maneuvers during loops, and even to hover his/her aircraft like a helicopter with the nose pointing straight up.

[[Image:F-16 Fighting Falcons above New York City(2).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Six [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s of the [[U.S. Air Force]] [[Thunderbirds (squadron)|Thunderbird]]s [[aerobatics]] team fly in [[Delta wing|delta formation]] in front of the [[Empire State Building]] in [[Manhattan]] during an [[air show]].]]
Military jet demos will often focus on the capabilities of the aircraft used in combat operations. The demo will include their very short (and very loud) takeoff rolls, fast speeds, slow approach speeds, as well as their ability to turn tight (in order to evade an enemy, or to turn around for another pass at a ground target) and climb quickly, and their ability to be precisely controlled at a large range of speeds. These are usually the highlight of an airshow – the loud, fast, and exciting demos spectators will remember. This is especially true when national teams perform, such as the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds of the USA, the Snowbirds of Canada, or the European teams such as the Red Arrows, Frecce Tricolori, or Patruille Française. Each team features up to nine agile military jets performing choreographed manoeuvres, often synchronized and in large formations. More often, though, military jet demos feature one single aircraft, usually a strike fighter or an advanced trainer.

Warbird demos allow modern audiences to familiarize themselves with the sights and sounds of aviation as it was two or maybe even three generations ago. These may include limited aerobatics or mock dogfights, but more often consist of a series of straight-line passes made by one or more World-War-2-era aircraft. Many warbird demos will feature large formations of warbirds, as would have been seen during World War 2. Often, the end of a warbird demo will coincide with the beginning of a modern military aircraft demo, and the old aircraft will fly along the new aircraft in what is known as a “Heritage Flight” (US Air Force) or a “Legacy Flight” (US Navy). This is a chance to see the great advances in aviation technology that have been achieved over the past six decades.

Helicopter demos usually focus on the search-and-rescue operations these helicopters are used for – such as lowering a rescuer via a cable, having him attach the rescuee to a harness, and then pulling them back up into the helicopter. Some military helicopters may also drop soldiers or vehicles, and even fire weapons, during these rescue operations. Fire-fighting water-drops are also occasionally included. Alternately, some helicopter demos may show off the agility and maneuverability of the helicopter, and the unique “tricks” it can do - these are usually performed with light two-seater helicopters.

Airshows can also feature air races, skydiving/paragliding demos, skywriting, wingwalking demos, glider demos, hovercraft, replicas of some of the earliest aircraft, new-technology demonstrator prototypes, cargo-transport or even airdrop demos, battlefield simulations (including soldiers, ground vehicles, helicopters, airplanes, and pyrotechnics), fire-fighting aircraft (which drop water or slurry), and remote-controlled aircraft. Interesting ground vehicles, such as vintage cars, race cars, modern muscle cars, military vehicles, and even the occasional jet-powered car or truck, are also often seen at airshows. Sometimes a &quot;race&quot; is staged between a ground vehicle (typically a muscle car or a jet-powered vehicle) and an aircraft (typically a warbird or an aerobatic airplane).

==Historical airshows==
*1909 Reims Air Meet in France in August 1909. A key aviator was [[Glenn Curtiss]] who won the Gordon Bennett Cup. This show inspired [[John Moisant]].
*1910 Dominguez Field, just south of Los Angeles, California from January 10, 1910 to January 20, 1910. Participants included: [[Glenn Curtiss]]; [[Charles Hamilton]]; [[Lincoln Beachey]]; and [[Louis Paulhan]]. The Los Angeles Times called it &quot;one of the greatest public events in the history of the West.&quot;
*1910 Harvard-Boston Aero Meet at the Harvard Aviation Field in [[Atlantic, Massachusetts]], from September 3, 1910 to September 13, 1910. It was the first major air event in the Eastern United States and offered $90,000 in prizes and appearance fees. Participants included: The [[Wright brothers]] and the [[Glenn Curtiss]] exhibition teams; and [[Claude Grahame-White]]. This show inspired: [[Harriet Quimby]]
*1910 Belmont International Aviation Tournament offered approximately $75,000 in prize money. Participants included: Count [[Jacques de Lesseps]]; [[Roland Garros]]; [[Claude Grahame-White]]; [[Glenn Curtiss]]; [[John Moisant]]; [[Arch Hoxsey]]; [[Ralph Johnstone]]; and [[Charles Hamilton]].

== Major airshows ==
*The two largest air and aerospace trade shows are the [[Farnborough Air Show]] ([[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], [[England]]), held on even years, and the [[Paris Air Show]] ([[Paris]], [[France]]), held on odd years. In addition to displays for the general public, these two shows have important showcases and display halls for professionnals. They are traditionally one of the occasions when major aerospace players announce deals.
*The third largest airshow, [[Asian Aerospace]], has been held in [[Singapore]] since its inception in 1981, although disagreements over a movement of the exhibition venue will see it move to [[Hong Kong]] in 2008. A new show, the [[Singapore Air Show]], will take its place in Singapore from the same year.
*The world's largest military air show is the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]] (RIAT) ([[RAF Fairford]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[United Kingdom]]), held annually in July.
*The annual [[Oshkosh Airshow]] ([[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]]), organized by the [[Experimental Aircraft Association]], is attended by more people and by more aircraft than any other airshow. The week-long event focuses on experimental aircraft, such as homebuilts and warbirds, but will also feature aerobatics acts, military aircraft, and airliners. The airshow also includes talks by famous or influential people in aviation, as well as a large area with booths where aircraft, aircraft parts, aircraft services, and aircraft memorabilia are sold, advertised, announced, or traded.
*Airshows in the US that display the widest variety of modern military aircraft (helicopters, jet fighters, bombers, cargo aircraft, stealth aircraft, etc) are typically the ones held at [[Nellis AFB]], [[NAS Oceana]], and [[Andrews AFB]]. Each of these features nearly all frontline aircraft in service with the US armed forces, and is held yearly.
*The US airshows with the most numerous and diverse (and often rare) warbirds include the [[Planes of Fame]] airshow at [[Chino, California|Chino]] and the &quot;Thunder Over Michigan&quot; show at [[Willow Run]]. The British equivalents are the airshows held in [[Duxford]]. The Oshkosh airshow, mentioned above, also features a large number and variety of warbirds. All these events are held once a year.
*Airbourne, taking place in [[Eastbourne]] on the south coast of [[England]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[cosmology]], the '''anthropic principle''' in its most basic form states the [[truism]] that any valid theory of the [[universe]] must be consistent with our existence as carbon-based human beings at this particular time and place in the universe. In other words, &quot;If something must be true for us, as humans, to exist, then it is true simply because we exist.&quot; Attempts to apply this principle to develop scientific explanations in [[cosmology]] have led to some confusion and much controversy.

==Origin==

The term &quot;anthropic principle&quot; was first proposed in 1973 by theoretical physicist [[Brandon Carter]] during the [[symposium]] &quot;Confrontation of Cosmological Theories with Observational Data&quot; in [[Kraków]] celebrating [[Copernicus]]&amp;#8217; 500th birthday, as if to proclaim that humanity does hold a special place in the [[universe]] after all. {{fn|(1)}} In his contribution &quot;Large Number Coincidences and the Anthropic Principle in Cosmology&quot; Carter remarks: &quot;Although our situation is not necessarily ''central'', it is inevitably privileged to some extent&quot; (IAUS 63 (1974) 291).

==Proponents and versions==

Proponents of the anthropic principle suggest that we live in a [[fine-tuned universe]], i.e. a universe that appears to be &quot;fine-tuned&quot; to allow the existence of [[life]] as we know it. If any of the [[fundamental physical constant]]s were sufficiently different, then life as we know it would not be possible and no one would be around to contemplate this fine-tuned universe we live in. Papers have been written arguing that the anthropic principle would explain the physical constants such as the [[fine structure constant]], the number of [[dimension]]s in the universe, and the [[cosmological constant]].   

The three primary versions of the principle, as stated by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank J. Tipler]] (1986), are:
* '''Weak anthropic principle (WAP)''': &quot;The observed values of all physical and cosmological quantities are not equally probable but they take on values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where carbon-based life can evolve and by the requirements that the Universe be old enough for it to have already done so.&quot;
* '''Strong anthropic principle (SAP)''': &quot;The Universe must have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history.&quot;
* '''[[Final anthropic principle]] (FAP)''': &quot;Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.&quot;

The weak version has been criticized as an [[argument by lack of imagination]] for assuming no other forms of life are possible (sometimes called ''&quot;carbon chauvinism&quot;'', see also [[alternative biochemistry]]). Furthermore, the range of constants allowing evolution of carbon-based life may be much less restricted than proposed (Stenger, &quot;Timeless Reality&quot;).  The weak anthropic principle has also been cited by both critics and supporters as a [[tautology]].  The strong version is also criticized as being neither testable nor falsifiable, and unnecessary.  The final version is discussed in more detail under [[final anthropic principle]]; Barrow and Tipler state that, although it is  a physical statement, it is nevertheless &quot;closely connected with moral values&quot;.

Proponents of [[intelligent design]] assert support from the anthropic principle. On the other hand, the existence of the [[multiverse]] or [[alternate universe]]s is hypothesized for other reasons and the anthropic principle provides a plausible explanation for the fine tuning of our universe. Assuming some possible universe would be capable of supporting intelligent life, some actual universes must do so, and ours clearly is one of those.  However, alternatives of the intelligent design conjecture are not limited to proposing the existence of alternate universes.  Also, [http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/anthropic.html it has been argued] that the anthropic principle as conventionally stated actually ''undermines'' the intelligent design conjecture (discussed in more detail under [[fine-tuned universe|fine tuning]]). In other words, proponents of [[evolution]] also assert support from the anthropic principle.

== ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' ==

In 1986, the [[controversial book]] ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank J. Tipler]] (Oxford University Press) was published. In this book Barrow, a cosmological scientist, and Tipler, a mathematical physicist, pioneered the '''anthropic principle''' in order to deal with the seemingly incredible coincidences that allow for our presence in a universe that appears to be perfectly set up for our existence. Everything from the particular energy state of the [[electron]] to the exact level of the [[weak nuclear force]] seems to be tailored for us to exist. The existence of carbon-based life in this universe is contingent upon several independent variables; and were any of these variables to take a slightly different value, carbon-based life could not exist.  The anthropic principle implies that our ability to ponder cosmology at all is contingent on ''all'' the correct variables being in place. According to critics, this is simply a [[tautology]], a very elaborate way of saying &quot;if things were different, they would be different&quot;, and that this weak anthropic principle is a truism that says nothing and explains nothing because in order for us to be here to ponder the universe, it had to be such that we can exist. According to [[Peter Schaefer (author)|Peter Schaefer]], that &quot;critics call it a truism&quot; is not a failure of the weak anthropic principle, since how can you refute a statement by saying that it is true? 

Brandon Carter presented his ideas about the anthropic principle in a 1974 publication of the [[International Astronomical Union]]. Later, in 1983, he claimed that, in its original form, the principle was meant only to caution astrophysicists and cosmologists of possible errors in the interpretation of astronomical and cosmological data unless the biological constraints of the observer were taken into account. In 1983 he also included the warning that the inverse was true for evolutionary biologists; Carter claimed that in interpreting the evolutionary record, one must take into account the astrophysical restraints of the process. Working with this in mind, Carter concluded that the evolutionary chain probably could include only one or two highly improbable links given the available time interval. A. Feoli and S. Rampone (&quot;Is the Strong Anthropic Principle Too Weak,&quot; 1999) argued that the estimated size of our universe and number of planets allows a higher bound, indicating no evidence for intelligent design in evolution.

There was renewed scientific interest in the anthropic principle in the late-1990s motivated by observational [[cosmology]] and theoretical work in [[quantum gravity]]. The theoretical work involved attempting to unify gravity with the other forces. While there were a number of promising developments, they all seemed to suffer from the problem that the fundamental physical constants seemed to be unconstrained. The observational motivation came from cosmological observations which gave firm values for quantities such as the matter density of the universe. Contrary to expectations, the value was not one, but 0.3, which is a non-obvious value.

Some alternatives to the anthropic principle do exist, the most optimistic being that a [[Theory of everything]] will ultimately be discovered, uniting all forces in the universe and deriving the properties of all the particles in the universe from scratch. Some candidates include [[M-Theory]] and various theories of [[quantum gravity]], although much of this is speculative. Another possibility is [[Lee Smolin]]'s model of [[Cosmological natural selection]], also known as [[Fecund universes]], which proposes that universes give &quot;offspring&quot; which are more plentiful if they happen to possess features common to our universe.

Recent publications (2004) by [[Stephen Hawking]] suggest that our universe is much less 'special' than the proponents of the anthropic principle claim it is. According to Hawking, there is a 98% chance that a universe of a type as ours will come from a [[Big Bang]]. Further, using the basic wavefunction of the universe as basis, Hawking's equations indicate that such a universe can come into existence without relation to anything prior to it, meaning that it could come out of nothing.  As of 2004, however, these publications and the theories in them are still subject to scientific debate, and in the past, Hawking himself has asked, &quot;What is it that breathes fire into the [[physical law|equations]] and makes a universe for them to describe?...Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?&quot; (Hawking, 1988).

== Anthropic principle in string theory ==
{{main|anthropic landscape}}

[[String theory]] predicts a large number of possible universes, called the backgrounds or [[vacua]]. The set of these of vacua is often called the anthropic landscape or string landscape. Some physicists, such as [[Leonard Susskind]], argue that the existence of a large number of vacua puts the anthropic reasoning on firm ground. Others, most notably [[David Gross]] but also [[Lubos Motl]] and [[Peter Woit]], argue that this is not predictive.  [[Steven Weinberg]] described the anthropic principle as a &quot;turning point&quot; in the history of science in his 2005 paper on the string landscape, &quot;Living in the multiverse&quot;.

== Anthropic bias and anthropic reasoning ==

In [[2002]], [[Nick Bostrom]] asked &quot;Is it possible to sum up the essence of [[observation selection effect]]s in a simple statement?&quot; He concluded that it might be, but that:

:Many 'anthropic principles' are simply confused. Some, especially those drawing inspiration from Brandon Carter's seminal papers, are sound, but... they are too weak to do any real scientific work. In particular, I argue that existing methodology does not permit any observational consequences to be derived from contemporary cosmological theories, in spite of the fact that these theories quite plainly can be and are being tested empirically by astronomers. What is needed to bridge this methodological gap is a more adequate formulation of how observation selection effects are to be taken into account.

His [[Self-Sampling Assumption]] is &quot;that you should think of yourself as if you were a random observer from a suitable reference class.&quot; This he expands into a model of [[anthropic bias]] and [[anthropic reasoning]] under the uncertainty introduced by not knowing your place in our [[universe]] - or even who &quot;we&quot; are. This may also be a way to overcome various [[cognitive bias]] limits inherent in the humans doing the observation and sharing [[models of our universe]] using [[mathematics]], as suggested in the [[cognitive science of mathematics]].

== Footnote ==
{{fnb|(1)}} The principle had, however, been invoked before then, e.g. in 1957, R.H. Dicke wrote: 'The age of the Universe &quot;now&quot; is not random but conditioned by biological factors ... [changes in the values of the fundamental constants of physics] would preclude the existence of man to consider the problem.' (R.H. Dicke, ''Principle of Equivalence and Weak Interactions'', Rev.Mod.Phys. 29, 355 (1957).) Even earlier statements of the principle may be found in [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s book ''Man's Place in the Universe'', which was first published in 1903. For example: &quot;such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been absolutely required ... in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man.&quot; (pp. 256-7 in the 1912 edition).

It also has analogs in, e.g., [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[historical materialism]]: &quot;The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature.&quot; (''The German Ideology'', [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm#a2 ch. 1])

[[Image:Australianarmy.gif|right|thumb|The Australian Army Emblem]]
The '''Australian Army''' is [[Australia|Australia's]] military land force. It is part of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) along with the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]].

The Australian Army is commanded by the Chief of the Army (CA), who is responsible to the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF).

As well as ground troops, approximately 80 [[Leopard MBT|Leopard tanks]] and artillery, it also operates helicopters: [[UH-60 Black Hawk|Blackhawk]], [[CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]], and has taken delivery of the first of  22 [[Eurocopter Tiger]] Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters (with the last of the [[UH-1 Iroquois]] serving with distinction in [[Aceh]] for humanitarian relief after [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] before removal from service.) Recently plans have been announced to procure 59 [[M1 Abrams|M1A2 tanks]] and 7 M88 Hercules II armoured recovery vehicles.

Australian soldiers have been involved in a number of minor and major conflicts throughout its history, but only in [[World War II]] did Australian territory come under direct attack.

The history of the Australian Army can be divided into two periods:
*1901-47, when limits were set on the size of the '''regular army''', the vast majority of peacetime soldiers were in the '''reserve army''' units of the [[Australian Citizens Military Force]] (also known as the CMF or Militia), and [[Australian Imperial Force]]s were formed to serve overseas, and
*post-1947, when a standing peacetime [[infantry]] force was formed and the CMF (known as the Army Reserve after 1980) began to decline in importance.

The army has been involved in many peacekeeping operations, usually under the auspices of the [[United Nations]]. The biggest one began in 1999 in [[East Timor]]. Other notable operations include peacekeeping on [[Bougainville]] and in the [[Solomon Islands]], which are ongoing as of May 2004. Humanitarian relief after [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] in [[Aceh]] Province, [[Indonesia]], [http://www.defence.gov.au/optsunamiassist/default.htm Operation Sumatra Assist], ended on [[24 March]] [[2005]].

==The Army Today==
{{further|[[Modern Equipment and Uniform of the Australian Army]]}}

===Organisation===
The Australian Army is currently organised around two Division headquarters. The Deployable Joint Force Headquarters/1st Division has responsibility for the majority of the regular army, while 2nd Division is the main home defence formation, containing Army Reserve units. The regular army is organised around the six battalion [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - three of these are standard light infantry, with two of the others roled as paratroops and mechanised infantry. The final battalion is a specialised commando unit class as special forces. The [[Royal Australian Armoured Corps]] has three regular regiments, one of main battle tanks and two light cavalry (formation reconnaissance). These forces, together with the associated combat support (artillery, engineers, signals) and combat service support (logistics, maintainence etc) are based around two deployable brigades, [[Australian 1st Brigade|1 Brigade]], which is primarily a heavy mechanised formation, and [[Australian 3rd Brigade|3 Brigade]], which is a light, air deployable formation. [[Australian 7th Brigade|7 Brigade]] is an integrated Regular/Reserve formation that would primarily be used in conjunction with DJHQ were it ever to be deployed overseas.

===Current deployments===
The Australian Army currently has significant forces deployed on two major operations:
*'''Operation Catalyst''' - Australia's commitment to the Coalition forces in [[Iraq]]. The army's contribution includes:
**[[Al Muthanna Task Group]]; this is a [[battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]] consisting of a headquarters, infantry company, armoured squadron and training team, with a total of 450 personnel. This has two tasks:
***Provide a secure environment for the Japanese Iraq Reconstruction and Support Group (JIRSG) 
***Assist in the training of local Iraqi Army units so that they are able to take over the internal and external defence of their country
**Australian Army Training Team; this encompasses 55 personnel providing logistic training to the [[new Iraqi Army]].
**Embassy security detatchment; this provides security protection and escort for staff at the Australian Embassy in [[Baghdad]], and consists of 100 personnel.
*'''[[Operation Slipper]]''' - Australia's commitment to the [[War on Terror]]. The army contribution is primarily concentrated in [[Afghanistan]] and consists of a '''Special Operations Task Group''' of personnel from the [[Special Air Service Regiment]], [[4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] and [[Incident Response Regiment]].
*In addition to these, small numbers of personnel are deployed on various operations around the world, including [[Timor-Leste]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and on peacekeeping duties with the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] and the [[United Nations]].
===&quot;Hardened and Networked Army&quot;===
On [[15 December]] [[2005]], the then Australian Minister for Defence, [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|The Hon. Senator Robert Hill]] announced  that the Australian Army would be restructured and redeveloped in the biggest ADF shake up in over 50 years. The policy of creating a  'Hardened and Networked' Army will see a major reorganisation of both the regular Army and Army Reserve. The overriding rationale for this is to bring about &quot;A reduction in singular capabilities that can not be rotated, hence an 'Army of twos'&quot;{{fn|1}}. This will involve the army being organised so that it can deploy a number of [[battlegroup (army)|battlegroups]], consisting of infantry, armour, artillery etc in the correct proportions relavent to each type of mission. For this, nine separate army units are being structured to act as battlegroup headquarters:
*[[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|1st]], [[2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|2nd]], and [[6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|6th]] Bn, [[Royal Australian Regiment]] are standard light infantry battalions, with [[5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|5/7 Bn]] as a mechanized battalion. The [[3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|3rd Bn]] is classed as a light infantry unit in the parachute role, though it is scheduled to convert to a mechanized battalion by 2011. 
*[[1st Armoured Regiment]]
*[[2nd Cavalry Regiment]]
*[[2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment|2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry)]]
*[[Australian 1st Aviation Regiment|1st Aviation Regiment]]

The 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment will be relocated from Sydney to Adelaide, converting from its current parachute role into a mechanised unit. This new 'battle group' will take on a similar role to 5/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment which is the major mechanised battalion. By the end of this process in approximately 2015, [[Australian 1st Brigade|1 Brigade]] will be the army's major mechanised formation. The armoured units of the Army Reserve in 2nd Division will be restructured, with four becoming pure light cavalry and the fifth being utilised in the armoured lift role.

==Rank and Insigina of the Australian Army==
The Ranks of the Australian Army are based on the ranks of the [[British Army]], and carry mostly the same actual insignia. Other than the shoulder title &quot;Australia&quot;, the [[Officer (armed forces)|Officer]] ranks are exactly identical. The [[Non-Commissioned Officer]] insignia are the same up until [[Warrant Officer]] ranks, where they are stylised for Australia.

The '''American Registry for Internet Numbers''' ('''ARIN''') is the [[Regional Internet Registry]] (RIR) for [[Canada]], the [[United States]], and portions of the [[Caribbean]]. 

Established in December 1997, ARIN is incorporated as a nonprofit in the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA. ARIN is one of five (5) RIRs. Like the other RIRs, ARIN:

* Provides services related to the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources in its respective service region. 
* Participates in the global Internet community;
* Facilitates the development of policy decisions made by its members and the stakeholders in its region;
* Is a nonprofit, membership organization;
* Is governed by an executive board elected by its membership.

== Services ==

ARIN provides services related to the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources. The nature of these services is described in ARIN's mission statement:

:''Applying the principles of stewardship, ARIN, a nonprofit corporation, allocates Internet Protocol resources; develops consensus-based policies; and facilitates the advancement of the Internet through information and educational outreach.''

These services are grouped in three areas: Registration, Organization, and Policy Development.

=== Registration Services ===

Registration Services pertain to the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources. They include:

* IP address space allocation, transfer, and record maintenance
* ASN allocation, transfer, and record maintenance
* Directories
** Registration transaction information (WHOIS)
** Routing information (Internet Routing Registry)
* DNS (Reverse)

=== Organization Services ===

Organization Services pertain to interaction between ARIN members and stakeholders and ARIN. They include:

* Elections
* Members Meetings
* Information publication and dissemination
* Education and training

=== Policy Development Services ===

Policy Development Services facilitate the development of policy for the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources in the ARIN region. They include:

* Maintaining discussion e-mail lists
* Conducting Public Policy Meetings
* Publishing policy documents

== Structure ==

ARIN is a nonprofit service organization that is responsive to the needs of the public it serves. Stakeholders in the community drive policies and activities, thus enabling ARIN to keep in step with their requirements. The organizational structure of ARIN is comprised of a 7-member Board of Trustees, a 15-member Advisory Council, and a professional staff of nearly 40. The Board of Trustees and Advisory Council are elected by ARIN members for three-year terms.

=== Board of Trustees ===

The ARIN membership elects the Board of Trustees, which has ultimate responsibility for the business affairs and financial health of ARIN, and manages ARIN's operations in a manner consistent with the guidance received from the Advisory Council and the goals set by the registry's members. The Board is responsible for determining the disposition of all revenues received to ensure that all services are provided in an equitable manner.

The Board votes on proposals generated from the membership and submitted through the Advisory Council. Executive decisions are carried out following approval by the Board.

The Board of Trustees consists of 7 members. Six members are elected by ARIN's membership and the President of ARIN serves as the seventh Trustee. Current members of the Board include Secretary Scott Bradner, Treasurer Lee Howard, President Ray Plzak, and the Chairman, [[John Curran]], as well as Trustees Bill Manning, Bill Woodcock, and [[Paul Vixie]].

=== Advisory Council ===

In addition to the Board of Trustees, ARIN has an Advisory Council. The Advisory Council serves in an advisory capacity to the Board of Trustees on IP allocation policy and related matters. Adhering to the procedures in the Internet Resource Policy Evaluation Process, the Advisory Council forwards consensus-based policy proposals to the Board for ratification, as well as membership proposals to the Board for formal votes.

The Advisory Council consists of 15 elected members. The President of ARIN is an ex-officio member and acts as the liaison between the Board of Trustees and the Advisory Council. The current chair of the Advisory Council is Ron da Silva.

==History==

[[Image:Arinlogo-sml.jpg|left|ARIN Logo from 1998 until 2001]] 

The organization was formed in December 1997 to &quot;provide [[Internet Protocol|IP]] registration services as an independent, nonprofit corporation.&quot; Until this time IP registration in the ARIN region was done by a department within the [[Network Solutions]] corporation, which provided the initial staff and  computer infrastructure for ARIN.

The first president of ARIN was Kim Hubbard, from 1997 until 2000. The current president of ARIN is Raymond Plzak.

Until late [[2002]] it served [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], [[South America]] and all of the [[Caribbean]]. [[LACNIC]] now handles parts of the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and South America. Also, [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was part of its region until recently, when [[AfriNIC]] was officially recognized by [[ICANN]] as the fifth [[Regional Internet Registry]] in April 2005. 

==Service Region==

The countries in the ARIN service region are:

* [[Anguilla]]
* [[Antigua and Barbuda]]
* [[Bahamas]]
* [[Barbados]]
* [[Bermuda]]
* [[Bouvet Island]] (Norway)
* [[Canada]]
* [[Cayman Islands]] (U.K.)
* [[Dominica]]
* [[Grenada]]
* [[Guadeloupe]] (France)
* [[Heard and McDonald Islands]] (Australia)
* [[Jamaica]]
* [[Martinique]] (France)
* [[Puerto Rico]] (U.S.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Akihabara''' (&amp;#31179;&amp;#33865;&amp;#21407;) is also known as '''Akihabara Electric Town''' (Akihabara Denki Gai).  It is located less than five minutes by rail from [[Tokyo Station]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Its name is sometimes shortened to ''Akiba'' by locals. While there is an official locality named Akihabara nearby, part of [[Taito-ku, Tokyo|Taito-ku]], the area known to most people as ''Akihabara'' (including the [[Japan Railway|JR]] railway station of the [[Akihabara Station|same name]]) is actually Soto-Kanda, a part of [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]]-ku.
[[Image:Akihabara_picture.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Akihabara in 2003]]

Akihabara is best-known as one of the largest shopping area on Earth for electronic, computer, [[anime]], and [[otaku]] goods, including new and used items. New items are mostly to be found on the main street, Chuo Dori, with used items of all descriptions (software, hardware, and junk galore) to be found in the back streets of Soto Kanda 3 chome. First hand parts for the do-it-yourself PC builder are readily available, with many places around for the hunter of the best price. Tools, electrical parts, wires, microsized cameras and more are to be found in the cramped (some might say dangerously so) passageways of Soto Kanda 1 chome (near the station). Foreign tourists tend to visit the big name shops like Laox or other speciality shops near the station. The locals, of course, know where to find better variety and prices, a little farther away.

==Otaku Culture==
[[Otaku]] culture in Akihabara is rather famous. Many people there have unique lifestyles, centered on technological enterprises and a love for Anime/Manga, that have made them outsiders in other sections of Japanese society. Otaku are afforded the chance to gather here and avoid alienation imposed by others who do not share their specific interests. The presence of such prolific &quot;geeky&quot; behavior has led to Akihabara being seen as a mecca of sorts for otaku.

==Brief history==
*The area was originally referred to by the name of the lumber dealer who occupied the site. To this day the East side of Akihabara retains the name of the lumber dealer　- 佐久間　- as a memorial.
*A major blaze which nearly destroyed the district brought about the decision to clear the land in order to keep future fires from approaching the imperial residence.
*After this, the area then known as（鎮火社）was increasingly referred to by everybody as Akihabara（秋葉原）for the autumn leaves that adorned the tall pines in the area.
*1888 – The removal of pine trees from Akihabara.
*1890 – Extension of [[JR]] rail line (now the [[Tohoku Line]]) from [[Ueno]] to Akihabara. At first there was no passenger service, for south of the station was the Akihabara cargo docks, where goods from all over the world would flow into Kanda by river and be hauled up the east bank of the canal to be ticketed at the central cargo transport window.
*From the [[Meiji]] to the [[Showa]] period, as the electric railway improved transport to Akihabara and the surrounds, and especially  due to the growth in dealerships, the district was designated as Seika city (青果市 – lit. Produce Market Town).
*1925 – Akihabara-Tokyo station connection opened as the Tohoku line extended to Tokyo.
*1932 – As the Green Line station opened with an interconnection, Akihabara became an important transfer point.
*1935 – Official establishment of Seika City. (Kanda/Seika city).
*1936 – The site of the “Eternal Grand Central” railway station was cleared (now abandoned). Railway mania had reached its zenith. The area became the number 1 place for electricity supplies.  
*After [[World War Two]], a black market at Kanda developed around the first school of electrical manufacturing (now the Tokyo Technical College). Clustered around the Sobu underground line, what began as a host of electrical stores selling vacuum tubes, radio goods and electrical items to the students, has today come to be known as Electric Town. Called ‘Musen’ or ‘Wireless’ shops, they were the first to begin selling radios. With the advent of wireless and radio goods, people came to be much more connected.
*1960’s – Thanks to superbly advanced technology, the rival Nipponbashi district of [[Osaka]] took its position as an equally prominent Electric Town, selling vast volumes of household consumer durables such as televisions, fridges and washing machines.
*1980’s – Accompanying the spread of the PC in family homes (‘Famikon’), local shops increasingly began to deal in computer games, and major gaming chain stores appeared on the market.
*1989 – Kanda-Seika city was redesignated as part of [[Taito-ku]].
*1990’s -  With the Yamada and Kojima household chain stores appearing throughout the suburban outskirts of Tokyo, the sale of consumer durables at Akihabara was greatly reduced, however the sale of computer goods increased in equal measure.
*1994 – The PC (‘Pasokon’) boom and accompanying computer store growth began.
*It was also during the 1990s that the anime craze grew out of computer games, and the youth group known as [[Otaku]] began to pour into Akihabara.
*Since 2000, with name-brand computer sales in decline, [[anime]] shops have arisen in their place, selling to the [[Otaku]] crowd.

'''Abandonware''' is [[computer software]] which is no longer being sold or supported by its [[copyright]] holder. Sometimes, it is used as a blanket category for any software over a certain age, usually five years.

The term has no legal meaning. This means that labeling any kind of software 'abandonware' does not make it legal to distribute it. Unless the author puts the software in the [[public domain]], any and all abandonware remains covered under [[copyright]] law until its copyright term expires.

Alternatively, the term is also used for software which is still available, but on which further support and development have been intentionally discontinued. This article discusses only the first meaning.

==History of abandonware==
Abandonware was quite low-key until the advent of the Internet, which enabled games to be accessible to a large audience. Some of the early abandonware sites include [[Classic Trash]] and [[Home of the Underdogs]], which has survived to this day, and is one of the largest abandonware sites on the internet.

In [[2001]], the [[Entertainment Software Association|ESA]] (or IDSA, as it was called then) began threatening lawsuits on sites that enabled illegal downloading of games belonging to its members. This resulted in many sites shutting down altogether.

==Abandonware and the Law==

Signatories of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) Treaty do not recognize a legal concept of abandonware in copyrights.  There is a long held concept of &quot;abandonment&quot; in [[trademark law]], but it is a direct result of the infinite term of trademark protection. Currently, for copyrights to be abandoned, the owner must clearly release the copyright in a writing (which has been done).  Non-owners of a copyright cannot merely claim the copyright &quot;abandoned&quot; and start using it without permission of the copyright holder, who would then have a legal remedy.

===United States===

In the United States, the concept of abandonware conflicts with the fundamental copyright concept of awarding a copyright creator a finite term where he/she may enjoy a monopoly on their expression.  Under copyright law, a copyright owner has the right to profit or ''not'' profit on their creation.  The basis for this right in the United States is the [[Copyright Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], which empowers the [[United States Congress]]:

:''To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries''

Because Abandonware would conflict with the stated goal of granting &quot;exclusive right&quot; (irrespective of profit), it is not likely to be recognized in the United States.  In [[2003]], the [[United States Supreme Court]] made copyright law more conservative in deciding ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'', 537 U.S. 186, which affirmed the legality of the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]], an act that extended the current copyright terms by an ''extra'' 20 years.  The decision noted that, so long as a copyright term is finite, it is permissible under the Constitution.  Thus, a copyright in the United States is protected by the full strength of the law until it expires, between 70 and 120 years after initial creation.

==Popular abandonware==
The most common abandonware is old [[computer and video games]] that are often played through [[emulator|emulation]].

Some people feel various older games are more fun than newer games (hence [[old school]] [[video game player|gamer]]s), in part because their [[game designer|designers]] had to concentrate on game-play features rather than [[computer graphics|graphics]]. These games have gained a second life through [[Internet]] distribution. Old-school gamers are responsible for the popularity of console emulation.  An '''abandonware fan''' is a video-game player who enjoys games that are no longer on the market.  In some cases, [[nostalgia]] is a significant factor in the popularity of abandonware video games.

==Enforcement of copyright==
Abandonware's copyright is frequently no longer defended. This can be due to intentional non-enforcement by its owners due to the software's age or obsolescence, but sometimes because the [[corporate]] copyright holder went out of business without transferring ownership, leaving no one to defend the copyright. (Copyrights on works created by an individual become the property of that person's [[estate (law)|estate]] after his/her death.) Nevertheless, some companies vehemently defend their rights to old games from which they're no longer making profit.

Proponents of abandonware argue that it is more ethical to make copies of such software than new software that still sells. Some who are ignorant of copyright law have incorrectly taken this to mean that abandonware is legal to distribute, although no software is old enough for its copyrights to have expired, and even in cases where the original company no longer exists, the rights usually still belong to someone.

Transfer of this software is still technically unlawful in most jurisdictions (except in cases of owner [[dissolution (law)|dissolution]]) as the copyright is still in effect.  Abandonware changes hands based on the presumption that the time and money that a copyright holder would have to spend enforcing the copyright is greater than any money the holder would earn selling software licenses.  Often the availability of abandonware on the Internet is related to the willingness of copyright holders to defend their copyrights.  For example, unencumbered games for [[Colecovision]] are markedly easier to find on the Internet than unencumbered games for [[Mattel Intellivision]] in large part because there is still a company that makes money by selling Intellivision games while no such company exists for the Colecovision.

Companies do sometimes voluntarily relinquish copyright on software, putting it into the [[public domain]], or re-license it as [[freeware]] or [[open source]]. [[id Software]] is notable as an early proponent of this practice, releasing older titles under an [[open source]] license. Another example is [[Amstrad]], who support emulation and free distribution of [[ZX Spectrum]] hardware ROMs and software. Transfer of public domain or free software is perfectly legal, distinguishing it from abandonware. It is uncommon for proprietary software companies to release software to the public domain or under an open source licence. However, many companies such as [[Novell]] and [[Sun]] have recently been experimenting with releasing their latest software under [[open source]] and [[free software]] licences which allow users not only to trade in the software freely but to sell and modify said software so long as they also release it under the same licence.

==Old copyrights that are still of value==
A common misconception is that &quot;abandonware&quot; is synonymous with &quot;old [[warez]]&quot;, that is, any software older than a certain threshold (a common one being five years). This is not always the case, as some software companies (like [[Apogee Software|Apogee]]) still offer many of their older titles for sale and actively pursue those who illegally offer them. [[Atari 2600]] games are commonly distributed on the Internet based on the presumption that no one would buy a primitive Atari game. However, [[mobile phone]] manufacturers have bought the rights to use these games, which can be made to work well on newer programmable mobile phones.

Some [[video game publisher|publishers]] argue that all abandonware distribution is harmful, whether it is still possible to buy the game or not. The reasoning is that because of the success companies like [[Nintendo]] and [[Activision]] have had in releasing old games for newer platforms like the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], [[Game Boy Advance]] and the [[PlayStation 2]], all abandonware has potential value, and that distributing it free on the Internet decreases the profits to be had from a legal rerelease. However, the reverse argument is also made: that the distribution of abandonware may help boost sales of new ports of old titles by making them popular again. Also, some argue that the new versions of classic titles are never as good as the classic ones.

Classic game compilations have become popular on the [[Xbox]], PlayStation 2, and GameCube. [[Capcom]] and [[Midway]] have released compilation discs, and many other companies are doing the same. Also, many companies add older games as an unlockable in newer titles, like the original [[Wolfenstein 3D]] in the Xbox version of ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', and ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' in ''[[Prince of Persia: Sands of Time]]''(contained in ''[[Prince of Persia: Warrior Within]]'' on the Xbox) the original [[Metroid]] was also unlockable in [[Metroid Prime]] ([[Gamecube]]) and [[Metroid: Zero Mission]] ([[Game Boy Advance]]), as well as being released on the GBA as Nintendo's [[NES classics]] series. And on handheld systems like the Game Boy Advance, classic games are rereleased or remade for the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Active Directory''' ([[Microsoft codenames|codename]] '''Cascade''') is an implementation of [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] [[directory service]]s by [[Microsoft]] for use in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] environments.  Active Directory allows administrators to assign enterprise wide policies, deploy programs to many computers, and apply critical updates to an entire organization. An Active Directory stores information and settings relating to an organization in a central, organized, accessible database. Active Directory networks can vary from a small installation with a few hundred objects, to a large installation with millions of objects.

Active Directory was previewed in 1996, released first with [[Windows 2000]], and saw some revision to extend functionality and improve administration in [[Windows Server 2003]].

==Structure==
===Objects===
An '''Active Directory''' (AD) structure is a hierarchical framework of [[objects]]. The objects fall into three broad categories &amp;mdash; resources (e.g. [[printer]]s), services (e.g. [[e-mail]]), and people (accounts, or users and groups). The AD provides information on the objects, organizes the objects, controls access, and sets security.

Each object represents a single entity &amp;mdash; whether a user, a computer, a printer, an application, or a shared data source &amp;mdash; and its attributes. Objects can also be containers of other objects. An object is uniquely identified by its name and has a set of attributes &amp;mdash; the characteristics and information that the object can contain &amp;mdash; defined by and depending on its type. The attributes, the basic structure of the object itself, are defined by a [[schema]], which also determines the kind of objects that can be stored in the AD.

The schema itself is made up of two types of objects: schema class objects and schema attribute objects. A single schema class object defines one type of object that can be created by AD &amp;mdash; for instance, it allows a User object to be created &amp;mdash; and a schema attribute object defines an attribute that objects can have.

Each attribute object can be used in several different schema class objects. Those objects are known as schema objects, or [[metadata]], and exist to allow the schema to be extended or modified when necessary. However, because each schema object is integral to the definition of AD objects, deactivating or changing these objects can have serious consequences because it will fundamentally change the structure of AD itself. A schema object, when altered, will automatically propagate through Active Directory and once it is created it can only be deactivated &amp;mdash; not deleted. Changing the schema is not something that is usually done without some planning

===Forests, Trees and Domains===
The framework that holds the objects is viewed at a number of levels. At the top of the structure is the Forest - the collection of every object, its attributes and rules (attribute syntax) in the AD. The forest holds one or more transitive trust linked Trees. A tree holds one or more Domains and domain trees, again, linked in a transitive trust hierarchy. Domains are identified by their [[Domain Name System|DNS]] name structure, the namespace. A domain has a single DNS name.

The objects held within a domain can be grouped into containers called Organizational Units (OUs). OUs give a domain a hierarchy, ease its administration, and can give a semblence of the structure of the AD's company in organisational or geographical terms. OUs can contain OUs - indeed, domains are containers in this sense - and can hold multiple nested OUs. Microsoft recommends as few domains as possible in AD and a reliance on OUs to produce structure and improve the implementation of policies and administration. The OU is the common level at which to apply [[group policies]], which are AD objects themselves called Group Policy Objects (GPOs), although policies can also be applied to domains or sites (see below). The OU is the lowest level at which administrative powers can be delegated.

As a further subdivision AD supports the creation of ''Sites'', which are physical, rather than logical, groupings defined by one or more IP subnets. Sites distinguish between locations connected by low-speed (e.g. [[Wide area network|WAN]], [[Virtual private network|VPN]]) and high-speed (e.g. [[local area network|LAN]]) connections. Sites can contain one or more domains and domains can contain one or more sites. This is important to control network traffic generated by replication.

The actual division of the company's information infrastructure into a hierarchy of one or more domains and top-level OUs is a key decision. Common models are by business, by geographical location, or by IT roles. These models are also often used in combination.

===Physical structure and Replication===
Physically the AD information is held on one or more equal peer [[domain controller]]s (DCs), replacing the [[Windows NT|NT]] PDC/BDC format (although there is a 'more equal' ''[[flexible single master operation]]'' (FSMO) server for some operations, which can simulate a PDC). Each DC holds a single domain partition and a read-and-write copy of the AD, changes on one computer being synchronized (converged) between all the DC computers by ''[[multi-master replication]]''. Servers without AD are called Member Servers.

Unlike earlier versions of Windows which used [[NetBIOS]] to communicate, Active Directory is fully integrated with DNS and [[TCPIP|TCP/IP]] - indeed DNS is ''required''.  To be fully functional, the DNS server must support [[SRV record|SRV resource records]] or service records.

AD replication is 'pull' rather than 'push'. The AD creates a replication topology that uses the defined ''sites'' to manage traffic. Intrasite replication is frequent and automatic through the ''Knowledge Consistency Checker'' (KCC), while intersite replication is configurable depending on the quality of each site link - a different 'cost' can be given to each link (e.g. [[DS3]], [[T1]], [[ISDN]] etc.) and replication traffic limited, scheduled, and routed accordingly. Replication data may be transitively passed through several sites on same-protocol ''site link bridges'', if the 'cost' is low, although AD automatically costs a direct site-to-site link lower than transitive connections. Site-to-site replication is between a ''bridgehead server'' in each site, which then replicate the changes to other DCs within the site.

With more than one domain the AD is not replicated across the forest; a global catalog (GC) is created, containing all the objects in the forest but only a subset of their attributes, a partial replica. The catalog is held on defined global catalog servers, to deal with inter-domain queries or pass requests across. Intra-domain convergence is by [[Remote procedure call|RPC]] over [[Internet Protocol|IP]], forestwide convergence is by [[SMTP]].

[[Flexible single master operation|FSMO]] handles situations where multimaster replication would be inadequate. There are five FSMO tasks - the previously noted  PDC emulation, relative ID master, and infrastructure master are domainwide roles; schema master and domain naming master are forestwide roles. In any domain there can be only one server handling a specific FSMO task.

The AD is split into three different stores or ''partitions''. The ''Schema'' which is the template for the entire AD, defining all object types, their classes, attributes, and attribute syntax (all trees are together in the forest because they share an identical schema). The ''Configuration'', which is the structure of the AD forest and trees. The ''Domain'', which holds all the information on the object created in that domain. The first two stores replicate to all domain controllers, while only a portion of each domain store is shared - as the global catalog with other domain controllers - as the domain boundaries are the limits for full domain object replication.

The AD [[database]], the ''directory store'', in Windows 2000 uses the [[Microsoft JET Blue|JET Blue-based]] [[Extensible Storage Engine]] (ESE98), limited to 16 terabytes and 1 billion objects in each domain controller's database (a theoretical limit, only 100 million or so have been tested. NT4's [[Security Account Manager]] could support no more that 40,000 objects). Called NTDS.DIT, it has two main tables: the ''data table'' and the ''link table''.  In Windows 2003 a third main table was added for security descriptor single instancing.

==Naming==
AD supports [[Universal Naming Convention|UNC]] (\), [[Uniform resource locator|URL]] (/), and LDAP URL names for object access. AD internally uses the LDAP version of the [[X.500]] naming structure.

Every object has a '''''Distinguished name''''' (DN), so a printer object called HPLaser3 in the OU Marketing and the domain foo.org, would have the DN: ''CN=HPLaser3,OU=Marketing,DC=foo,DC=org'' where ''CN'' is common name and ''DC'' is domain object class, DNs can have many more than four parts. The object can also have a '''''Canonical name''''', essentially the DN in reverse, without identifiers, and using slashes: ''foo.org/Marketing/HPLaser3''. To identify the object within its container the '''''Relative distinguished name''''' (RDN) is used: ''CN=HPLaser3''. Each object also has a '''''Globally unique identifier''''' (GUID) an unique and unchanging 128-bit string which is used by AD for search and replication. Certain objects also have a '''''User principal name''''' (UPN), an ''objectname''@''domain name'' form. 
&lt;!-- Trust doesn't belong in the middle of the chapter about Structure. This is temporary here. --&gt;

==Trust==
&lt;div id=&quot;trust&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;To allow users in one domain to access resources in another, AD uses trust. Trust is automatically produced when domains are created. The forest sets the default boundaries of trust, not the domain, and implicit trust is automatic. As well as two-way transitive trust, AD trusts can be ''shortcut'' (joins two domains in different trees, transitive, one- or two-way), ''forest'' (transitive, one- or two-way), ''realm'' (transitive or nontransitive, one- or two-way), or ''external'' (nontransitive, one- or two-way) in order to connect to other forests or non-AD domains. AD uses the [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] V5 protocol, although [[NTLM]] is also supported and web clients use SSL/TLS.

=== Trusts in Windows 2000 (native mode) ===
Simply speaking, AD uses trust to allow users in one domain to have access to files in another. The AD trust relationship is a mechanism by which users in one domain can be authenticated by another domain and then be allowed (or disallowed) access to resources within it. Each Windows domain has implicit, two-way, transitive trust relationships with other domains. Such trusts are automatically maintained between domains. For example, if domain A trusts domain B, and B trusts C, then:
* Domain A trusts domain C because trusts are transitive. Users from domain A can access files from domain C.
* Domain C trusts domain A because trusts are two-way. Users from domain C can access files from domain A.

Domains can also have explicit, manually created trust relationships. Explicit trusts can be:
* Shortcut trusts - joins any two domains within the same forest, in order to reduce access time to resource. The shortcut trust is transitive and one-way.
* External trusts – joins two domains in different forests, allows users from one forest to have access to resources from another forest. The external trust is non-transitive, non-Kerberos and one-way.

==ADAM==
'''Active Directory Application Mode''' (ADAM) is a light-weight implementation of Active Directory.  ADAM is capable of running as a simple user service.  Due to its small resource requirements, multiple ADAM instances are able to run on the same server.  The API is identical to that of a full-blown Active Directory implementation, so developers do not need to learn new skills to utilize it.

==Notes==
&lt;!-- Instructions for adding a footnote:
   NOTE: Footnotes in this article use names, not numbers. Please see [[Wikipedia:Footnote3]] for details.
     1) Assign your footnote a unique name, for example TheSun_Dec9.
     2) Add the macro {{ref|TheSun_Dec9}} to the body of the article, where you want the new footnote.
     3) Take note of the name of the footnote that immediately proceeds yours in the article body.
     4) Add #{{Note|TheSun_Dec9}} to the list, immediately below the footnote you noted in step3.
     5) Multiple footnotes to the same reference will not work: you must insert two uniquely-named footnotes.
   NOTE: It is important to add the Footnote in the right order in the list.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aron Nimzowitsch''' (also '''Nimzovich''' or '''Niemzowitsch''') ([[November 7]], [[1886]], [[Riga]] – [[March 16]], [[1935]], [[Denmark]]) was a [[Latvia]]n [[chess grandmaster]]. He was the foremost figure amongst the ''[[hypermodernism (chess)|hypermoderns]]''.

Nimzowitsch came from a wealthy Jewish family and learned chess from his father. He travelled to [[Germany]] in [[1904]] to study [[philosophy]], but began a career as a professional chess player that same year. After tumultuous years during and after [[World War I]], Nimzowitsch moved to [[Copenhagen]] in [[1922]] (some sources say [[1920]]) and lived there until his death. He is buried in Bispebjerg Cemetery in Copenhagen.

Nimzowitsch's [[chess|chess theories]] flew in the face of pre-existing convention. While there were those like [[Alexander Alekhine|Alekhine]], [[Emanuel Lasker|Lasker]], and even [[Jose Raul Capablanca|Capablanca]]  who did not live by  [[Siegbert Tarrasch|Tarrasch]]'s rigid teachings, the acceptance of Tarrasch's ideas, all simplifications of the more profound [[Wilhelm Steinitz|Steinitz]], was nearly universal. That the center had to be controlled by [[pawns]] and that development had to happen in support of this control — the core ideas of Tarrasch's chess philosophy—were things every beginner thought to be irrefutable laws of nature like gravity.

Nimzowitsch shattered these assumptions. He discovered such concepts as [[overprotection]] (the least important of his ideas from a modern standpoint though still interesting and sometimes applicable), control of the center by pieces instead of pawns, blockade, [[prophylaxis (chess)|prophylaxis]] — playing to prevent the opponent's plans — and the [[fianchetto]] (in the case of the fianchetto, one could argue that it was a rediscovery, but Nimzowitsch certainly refined its use).  He also formalised strategies using open files, outposts and invasion of the seventh rank, all of which are widely accepted today.

He wrote three books on chess strategy: ''[[Mein System]] (My System)'' ([[1925]]), ''Die Praxis meines System (The Practice of my System)'' (commonly known as ''Chess Praxis''), and ''Die Blockade'' (The Blockade). The last of these is hard to find in English, however, and much that is in it is covered again in ''Mein System''. It is said that 99 out of 100 chess masters have read ''Mein System''; consequently, most consider ''My System'' to be Nimzowitsch's greatest contribution to chess. It sets out Nimzowitsch's most important ideas while his second most influential work, ''Chess Praxis'', elaborates upon these ideas, adds a few new ones, and has immense value as a stimulating collection of Nimzowitsch's own games even when these games are more entertaining than instructive.

At the height of his career, Nimzowitsch was the third best player in the world, immediately behind Alekhine and Capablanca. Although a contemporary of these two, he never played either of them in a serious match. His most notable successes were first place finishes at [[Copenhagen]] [[1928]], the [[Carlsbad]] tournaments of [[1929]], [[1933]], and [[1934]] and second place behind Alekhine at [[San Remo]] in [[1930]]. Nimzowitsch never developed a knack for match play though; his best match success was a draw with Alekhine (though this match was only three games long and was in [[1914]], 13 years before Alekhine became world champion). 

Many chess openings and variations are named after him, the most famous being the [[Nimzo-Indian Defence]] (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4) and the less often played [[Nimzowitsch Defence]] (1.e4 Nc6). Both of these exemplify Nimzowitsch's ideas about controlling the center with pieces. He was also vital in the development of two [[French Defense]] systems, the Winawer Variation (in some places called the Nimzowitsch Variation; its moves are 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4) and the Advance Variation (1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5).

Nimzowitsch influenced numerous other players, including [[Richard Réti]] and [[Tigran Petrosian]], and his influence is still felt today.

There are numerous entertaining anecdotes regarding Nimzowitch—some more savory than others. For example, he once missed the first prize by losing to [[Sämisch]]; immediately upon learning this, Nimzowitsch got up on a table and shouted, “Why must I lose to this idiot?”  

Although Nimzowitsch did not win a single game against Capablanca, he fared better against Alekhine.
He even beat Alekhine with black pieces in [[St. Petersburg]] in [[1914]] (moves given in [[Algebraic chess notation]]):[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1011921]

:''This article is about the Aragonese language.  For the cartoonist and writer, see [[Sergio Aragonés]]''

'''Aragonese''' (''aragonés'') is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] now spoken by some 10,000 people over the valleys of the [[Aragón River]], [[Sobrarbe]] and [[Ribagorza]] in the [[province]] of [[Huesca (province)|Huesca]], [[Aragon]], [[Spain]].  It is also colloquially known as ''fabla''.

Aragonese originated around the [[8th century]] as one of many [[Latin]] dialects developed in the Pyrenees on top of a strong [[Basque language|Basque]]-like substratum. The original [[kingdom of Aragon]] (formed by the counties of Aragon, Sobrarbe and Ribagorza) was progressively expanded from the mountain ranges towards the South, pushing the [[Moors]] further South in the ''[[Reconquista]]'' and spreading the Aragonese language.

The dynastic union of the [[Catalonia|Catalan Counties]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]]&amp;mdash;which formed the [[Aragonese Crown]] in the 12th century&amp;mdash;did not result in a merging of the language forms of the two territories into a single form; [[Catalan language|Catalan]] continued to be spoken in the east, and Aragonese in the west. Moreover, Catalan was the language that expanded into the new territories conquered to the [[Moors]]: the [[Balearic Islands]] and the new kingdom of [[Valencia]]. The ''Aragonese'' reconquista to the south ended in the kingdom of [[Murcia]], that was ceded by [[James I of Aragon]] to the Kingdom of [[Castile]] as a dowry for an Aragonese princess.

The spread of Castilian, now known as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] too, together with the 
protective effect from it that Aragonese played for the Catalan language, the Castilian origin amb the Trastamara dynasty and a deep likeness between Castilian and Aragonese, meant that further recession was to follow. One of the key moments in the history of Aragonese was when a king of Castilian origin was appointed in the [[15th century]]: [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]], (a.k.a. Ferdinand of Antequera).

The annexation of Aragon by Castile and the progressive suspension of all capacity of self-rule from the 16th century meant that Aragonese, while still widely spoken, was limited to a rural and colloquial use, as the nobility chose Spanish as their symbol of power. The suppression of Aragonese reached its most dramatic point during the rule of [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[20th century]]. Pupils were beaten in schools for using it, and [[language politics in Francoist Spain]] forbade the teaching of any language that was not Spanish.

The constitutional democracy voted by the people in [[1978]] meant an increase in the literary works and studies conducted in and about the Aragonese language. However, it may be too late for this language. 

Nowadays, Aragonese is still spoken natively within its core area, the Aragonese mountain ranges of the Pyrenees, in the comarcas of Somontano, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza.
These are the major cities and towns where Aragonese speakers can still be found: [[Huesca]], [[Graus]], [[Monzón]], [[Barbastro]], Fonz, Echo, Estadilla, [[Benasque]], [[Sabiñánigo]], [[Jaca]], Plan, Ansó, [[Ayerbe]], Broto, El Grado.

Aragonese is also learnt as a second language by other inhabitants of the country in areas like [[Huesca|Uesca]], [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]], [[Ejea de los Caballeros|Exea]], and [[Teruel]]. According to recent polls, altogether they only make up around 30,000 speakers.

Some historical traits of Aragonese language:
*As in Spanish, open O,E from Romance result systematically into diphthongs {{IPA|[we]}}, {{IPA|[je]}}, e.g. VET'LA &gt; ''biella'' (old woman, Spa. ''vieja'', Cat. ''vella'')
*Loss of final unstressed -E, e.g. GRANDE &gt; ''gran'' (big)
*Unlike [[Spanish language|Spanish]] Romance initial F- is preserved, e.g. FILIU &gt; ''fillo'' (son, Spa. ''hijo'', Cat. ''fill'')
*Romance yod (GE-,GI-,I-) results in voiceless palatal affricate ''ch'' {{IPA|[&amp;#679;]}}, e.g. IUVEN &gt; ''choben'' (young man), GELARE &gt; ''chelar'' (to freeze, Spa. ''helar'', Cat. ''gelar'')
*Like in [[Occitan language|Occitan]] Romance groups -ULT-, -CT- result in {{IPA|[jt]}}, e.g. FACTU &gt; ''feito'' (done, Spa. ''hecho'', Cat. ''fet'')
*Romance groups -X-, -PS-, SCj- result into voiceless palatal fricative ''ix'' {{IPA|[&amp;#643;]}}, e.g. COXU &gt; coixo (crippled, Spa. ''cojo'', Cat. ''coix'')
*Unlike [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Romance groups -Lj-, -C'L-, -T'L- result into palatal lateral ''ll'' {{IPA|[&amp;#654;]}}, e.g. MULIERE &gt; ''muller'' (woman, Spa. ''mujer'', Cat. ''muller'')), ACUT'LA &gt; ''agulla'' (needdle, Spa. ''aguja'', Cat. ''agulla'')
*Unlike [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Latin -B- is maintained in past imperfect endings of verbs of the 2nd and 3rd conjugations: ''teniba'' (he had, Spa. ''tenía'', Cat. ''tenia''))

[[Ribagorçan]] dialect might be considered a transitional Romance variant which shares features with both Catalan and Aragonese.

{{Table Mobile phone standards}}
'''Advanced Mobile Phone System''' or '''AMPS''' is the [[analog signal|analog]] [[mobile phone]] system standard developed by [[Bell Labs]], and officially introduced in the [[Americas]] in 1984.  Though analog is no longer considered advanced at all, the relatively seamless [[cellular]] [[switching]] [[technology]] AMPS introduced was what made the original mobile [[radiotelephone]] practical, and was considered quite advanced at the time.

==Technology==
It was a first-generation technology, using [[FDMA]] which meant each cell site would transmit on different frequencies, allowing many cell sites to be built near each other. However it had the disadvantage that each site did not have much capacity for carrying calls. It also had a poor [[security]] system which allowed people to steal a phone's serial code to use for making illegal calls. It was later replaced by the newer Digital [[TDMA]] systems, such as [[Digital AMPS]] and [[GSM]], which brought improved security as well as increased capacity.

AMPS was originally standardized by ANSI as EIA/TIA/IS-3.  This was later superseded by EIA/TIA-553 and TIA interim standard IS-91.

==Frequency bands==
AMPS cellular service operates in the 800 [[MHZ]] [[FM]] band.  For each market area, the FCC allowed two licensee (networks) known as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; carriers.  Each carrier within a market uses a specified &quot;block&quot; of frequencies consisting of 21 control channels and 395 voice channels. Originally, the B (wireline) side license was usually owned by the local phone company such as a &quot;Baby Bell&quot; (Ameritech), and the A (non-wireline) license was made available to private companies such as Cellular One.  At the inception of cellular in 1984, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] had granted each carrier within a market 333 channels (666 channels total).  By the late 1980's, the cellular industry's subscriber base had grown into the millions across America and it became necessary to add channels for additional capacity.  In 1989, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] granted carriers an expansion from the current 666 channels to the now 832 (416 per carrier).  The additional frequency was available in the upper 800 MHz band which also was home to UHF channels 70-83.  This meant that these UHF channels could no longer be used for UHF TV transmission as these frequencies were to be used for AMPS transmission.  

The anatomy of each channel is composed of 2 [[frequency|frequencies]]. 416 of these are in the 824~849 MHz range for transmissions from mobile stations to the base stations, paired with 416 frequencies in the 869~894 MHz range for transmissions from base stations to the mobile stations.  Each cell site will use a subset of these channels, and must use a different set than neighboring cells to avoid interference.  This significantly reduces the number of channels available at each site in real-world systems.  Each AMPS frequency is 30kHz wide.

==Introduction of digital TDMA==
Later, many AMPS networks were partially converted to what became (incorrectly) known as '''TDMA''', a [[digital]],  [[2G]] standard used mainly by [[Cingular Wireless]] and [[U.S. Cellular]].  The misuse of the term '''TDMA''' (which is a type of channel sharing scheme) to refer to a particular access protocol has caused some confusion. The first version of the TDMA standard was known as [[IS-54]].

==Introduction of GSM and CDMA==
AMPS and TDMA are now being phased out in favor of either [[CDMA]] or [[GSM]] which allow for higher capacity data transfers for services such as [[WAP]], [[Multimedia Messaging System]] (MMS), and wireless Internet Access. The major difference between the two options is that CDMA has a much higher capacity then GSM, as well as some other features (i.e. being able to talk to six different cell sites simultaneously, and a higher bitrate [[Vocoder]]). There are some phones capable of supporting AMPS, TDMA and GSM all in one phone (using the [[GAIT (wireless)|GAIT]] standard; see the [[Nokia 6340]], for example); however, AMPS/CDMA phones supports nearly seamless roaming between CDMA and AMPS (with the loss of some features when in AMPS mode, such as text messaging) while GAIT phones cannot.

==The Future of AMPS==
AMPS is the most extensive and reliable wireless coverage available for nationwide service in North America. Even today, analog continues to provide the widest range of coverage across the U.S. and Canada.  However, in 2002, the [[FCC]] made the drastic desicion to no longer require A and B carriers to support AMPS cellular service as of March 1, 2008.  Since the AMPS standard is analog technology, it suffers from an inherently inefficient use of the frequency spectrum.  All AMPS carriers have converted most of their consumer base to a digital standard such as CDMA or GSM and continue to do so at a rapid pace.  Digital technologies such as CDMA support multiple voice calls on the same channel, superior call qualiy, enhanced features such as two-way text messaging, voicemail indicator, internet, and GPS services; whereas, AMPS can only support one call per channel and a basic one-way short message service.  

[[OnStar]] still heavily relies on North American AMPS service for its subscribers because it provides the best  and most reliable coverage and their entire system was built around analog cellular technology.  Thankfully, cellular companies who own an A or B license (such as Verizon and Alltel) must still provide reliable analog service until March 1, 2008.  However after that point, most cellular companies will be eager to shut down AMPS and use the remaining channels for even more capacity and enhanced data services.  [[OnStar]] is currently in a digital transition but warns customers who cannot be upgraded to digital that their service will permanetly expire on February 1, 2008.

==Analog system in Europe==
'''Total Access Communication System''' or '''TACS''' is the [[Europe]]an version of AMPS. '''ETACS''' was an extended version of TACS with more channels.  TACS and ETACS are now obsolete in Europe, having been replaced by the more scalable and all-digital [[GSM]] system. Nordic Mobile Telephone system (NMT) is another analogue cellular standard that was widely used in Europe mainly in the nordic countries (Norway Denmark Sweden). The NMT system was set in use in the early 1980's and is now completely replaced by GSM and WCDMA. The NMT system operates in the 450 and 900 Mhz band.

==Companies using AMPS==
*[[Telecom New Zealand]] - Telecom customers are in the process of migrating over to the new [[CDMA]] service. The old AMPS/[[D-AMPS]] system is due to be phased out in 2007. Since the establishment of the AMPS service in 1987 the network had always had the largest coverage of any network in [[New Zealand]]. In recent times, however, Digital [[GSM]] and CDMA coverage has matured enough to match or exceed AMPS coverage in many areas. Unfortunately some areas may lose mobile phone service when the AMPS network goes offline.
*[[Verizon Wireless]] - Although most Verizon customers use digital services, the backup AMPS network is still in service.  Verizon has been noted they are eager to quickly shut down the analog system when the FCC mandate allows.
*[[Bell Mobility]], [[Telus Mobility]] and [[Rogers Wireless]] all operate AMPS networks in Canada, though they have since been overlaid with digital services.
*[[Alltel]] - In 2005 they disclosed that only 15% of their total customer base are still using the existing analog network. The company has not made any official announcements as to when analog service will be discontinued.  One plan involves only keeping analog service active in rural or outlying areas until digital service is fully developed.  With the recent acquisition of Western Wireless, Alltel now takes the claim of the &quot;largest network in America.&quot;  This being true, oddly enough because of wide analog coverage in rural areas.

      <comment>/* Aerodynamic forces on aircraft */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aerodynamics''' is a branch of [[fluid dynamics]] concerned with the study of gas flows.  The solution of an aerodynamic problem normally involves calculating for various properties of the flow, such as [[velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and [[temperature]], as a function of space and time.  Understanding the flow pattern makes it possible to calculate or approximate the [[force|forces]] and [[moment (physics)|moments]] acting on bodies in the flow.  This mathematical analysis and empirical approximation form the scientific basis for [[heavier than air flight|heavier-than-air flight]].

Aerodynamic problems can be classified in a number of ways.  The flow environment defines the first classification criterion.  ''External'' aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes.  Evaluating the [[lift (force)|lift]] and [[drag (physics)|drag]] on an [[airplane]], the [[shock wave]]s that form in front of the nose of a [[rocket]] or the flow of air over a hard drive head are examples of external aerodynamics.  ''Internal'' aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects.  For instance, internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a [[jet engine]] or through an [[air conditioning]] pipe.

The ratio of the problem's characteristic flow speed to the [[speed of sound]] comprises a second classification of aerodynamic problems.  A problem is called [[subsonic]] if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound, [[transonic]] if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), [[supersonic]] when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and [[hypersonic]] when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound.  Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; minimum [[Mach number]]s for hypersonic flow range from 3 to 12.  Most aerodynamicists use numbers between 5 and 8.

The influence of [[viscosity]] in the flow dictates a third classification.  Some problems involve only negligible viscous effects on the solution, in which case viscosity can be considered to be nonexistent.  The approximations to these problems are called [[inviscid flow]]s.  Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called [[viscous flow]]s.

==Aerodynamic forces on aircraft==
[[Image:aeroforces.jpg|thumb|350px|Forces on an aircraft ([[airfoil]] pictured)]]
One of the major goals of aerodynamics is to predict the aerodynamic forces on aircraft.

The four basic forces that act on a powered aircraft are [[lift (force)|lift]], [[weight]] (or [[gravity]]), [[thrust]], and [[drag (physics)|drag]].  

Weight is the force due to gravity and thrust is the force generated by the engine.  Lift and drag are forces due to the motion of the vehicle through the air.  Lift is defined as the aerodynamic force acting perpendicular to the relative airflow and drag is defined as the aerodynamic force acting parallel to the relative airflow. Lift is positive upwards and drag is positive rearwards.

==Aerodynamics in other fields==

Aerodynamics is important in a number of applications other than aerospace engineering.  It is a significant factor in any type of vehicle design, including [[automobile]]s.  It is important in the prediction of forces and moments in [[sailing]].  It is used in the design of small components such as [[hard drive]] heads.  [[Civil engineering|Civil engineers]] also use aerodynamics, and particularly [[aeroelasticity]], to calculate [[wind]] loads in the design of large buildings and bridges. Urban aerodynamics seeks to help town planners and designers improve comfort in outdoor spaces, create urban microclimates and reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics studies the ways atmospheric circulation and flight mechanics affects ecosystems. The aerodynamics of internal passages is important in heating/ventalation, gas piping, and in automotive engines where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.

==Continuity assumption==

Gases are composed of [[molecule]]s which collide with one another and solid objects.  In aerodynamics, however, gases are considered to have continuous quantities.  That is, properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and velocity are taken to be well-defined at infinitely small points, and are assumed to vary continuously from one point to another.  The discrete, molecular nature of a gas is ignored.

The continuity assumption becomes less valid as a gas becomes more rarefied.  In these cases, [[statistical mechanics]] is a more valid method of solving the problem than aerodynamics.

==Conservation laws==

Aerodynamic problems are solved using the conservation laws, or equations derived from the conservation laws.  In aerodynamics, three conservation laws are used:
*Conservation of mass: Matter is not created or destroyed.  If a certain mass of fluid enters a volume, it must either exit the volume or increase the mass inside the volume.
*Conservation of momentum: Also called [[Newton's second law of motion]]
*Conservation of energy: Although it can be converted from one form to another, the total [[energy]] in a given system remains constant.

All aerodynamic problems are therefore solved by the same set of equations.  However, they differ by the assumptions made in each problem.  The equations become simpler as assumptions are made.

Note that in [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[special relativity|relativistic mechanics]] the conserved energy includes the rest mass energy through the equation E=Mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Boundary layer==
The concept of [[boundary layer]] is important in most aerodynamic problems.  The viscosity and fluid friction in the air is usually important only in this thin layer.  This principle makes aerodynamics much more tractable mathematically and also intuitively.

==Subsonic aerodynamics==

In a [[subsonic]] aerodynamic problem, all of the flow speeds are less than the speed of sound.  This class of problems encompasses nearly all internal aerodynamic problems, as well as external aerodynamics for most aircraft, model aircraft, and automobiles.

In solving a subsonic problem, one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is whether or not to incorporate the effects of compressibility.  Compressibility is a description of the amount of change of density in the problem.  When the effects of compressibility on the solution are small, the aerodynamicist may choose to assume that density is constant.  The problem is then an incompressible problem.  When the density is allowed to vary, the problem is called a compressible problem.  In air, compressibility effects can be ignored when the [[Mach number]] in the flow does not exceed 0.3.  Above 0.3, the problem should be solved using compressible aerodynamics.

==Transonic aerodynamics==

Transonic aerodynamic problems are defined as problems in which both supersonic and subsonic flow exist.  Normally the term is reserved for problems in which the characteristic [[Mach number]] is very close to one.

Transonic flows are characterized by [[shock wave]]s and [[expansion wave]]s.  A shock wave or expansion wave is a region of very large changes in the flow properties.  In fact, the properties change so quickly they are nearly discontinuous across the waves.  

Transonic problems are arguably the most difficult to solve. Flows behave very differently at subsonic and supersonic speeds, therefore a problem involving both types is more complex than one in which the flow is either purely subsonic or purely supersonic.


==Supersonic aerodynamics==

[[Supersonic]] aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound.  Calculating the lift on the [[Concorde (aeroplane)|Concorde]] during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem.

Supersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow.  The speed of sound can be considered the fastest speed that &quot;information&quot; can travel in the flow.  Gas travelling at subsonic speed diverts around a body before striking it, so it can be said to &quot;know&quot; that the body is there.  Air cannot divert around a body when it is travelling at supersonic speeds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andreas Schlüter''' ([[May 20]] [[1660]] in Danzig – May [[1714]] in [[St. Petersburg]]) was a [[baroque]] sculptor and architect associated with the [[Petrine Baroque]] style of architecture and decoration. [[Image:Kikin.jpg|thumb|300px|Kikin Palace in [[St Petersburg]] is often attributed to Schlüter, although there is no proof of his authorship.]]

Schlüter was probably born in Polish city of [[Gdańsk]] (Danzig), where he also spent his early years. In [[1681]], he started working for King [[Jan III Sobieski]], decorating the [[facade]] of the royal chapel in Gdańsk, and creating statues for the [[Wilanów Palace]] and sepulchral sculptures in [[Zolkiew|Żółkiew]]. In [[1689]], he moved to [[Warsaw]], where he worked for [[Jan Dobrogost Krasinski|Jan Dobrogost Krasiński]] and did the [[pediment]] reliefs and sculptural work of [[Krasinski Palace]]. 

In [[1694]], he left Poland to work as court sculptor for Duke [[Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg|Frederick Wilhelm I]], in [[Berlin]]. He also worked as an architect and built many state buildings. The castle he designed in [[Berlin]] was partially destroyed by bombing in [[World War II]] and its remains were demolished by the subsequent [[Communist]] regime. He designed the famous [[Amber Room]]. His sculpted decoration for [[Arsenal]] in Berlin is a masterpiece of [[baroque]] expression and [[pathos]]. In 1713 his fame brought him to work for Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]], where he not long after died of an illness.
