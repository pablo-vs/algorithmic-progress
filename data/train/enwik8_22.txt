'''Alternative medicine''' broadly describes methods and practices used in place of, or in addition to, [[medicine|conventional medical]] treatments.  The precise scope of alternative medicine is a matter of some debate and depends to a great extent on the definition of &quot;conventional medicine.&quot; Many practitioners regard the distinction as false, preferring &quot;good medicine&quot; (which demonstrably works) and &quot;bad medicine.&quot; Richard Dawkins, professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, notes that alternative medicine is defined as that set of practices that cannot be tested, refuse to be tested or consistently fail tests.

The debate on alternative medicine is complicated further by the diversity of treatments that are categorized as &quot;alternative.&quot;  These include practices that incorporate spiritual, metaphysical, or religious underpinnings; non-European medical traditions; newly developed approaches to healing; and a number of others.  Proponents of one class of alternative medicine may reject others.

Detractors of alternative medicine may also define it as &quot;diagnosis, treatment, or therapy which can be provided legally by persons who are not licensed to diagnose and treat illness,&quot; although some medical doctors find value using alternative therapies in the practice of &quot;complementary medicine.&quot;

Many in the scientific community define alternative medicine as any treatment, the efficacy and safety of which has not been verified through [[peer-review]]ed, controlled studies. This form of definition is not based on political views, turf protection, or economic interests, but hinges exclusively on questions of effectiveness and safety. It is thus possible for a method to change categories ''in either direction'', based on increased knowledge of its effectiveness or lack thereof.

Some techniques and therapies once considered to be &quot;alternative&quot;, have - upon being proven to be effective - been accepted into mainstream medicine.

The opposite is equally true, with methods once thought to be effective being dropped when it has been discovered that their only effect was because of the [[placebo effect]], or when their side effects were found to result in an unfavorable safety-to-benefit ratio.

Various advocates and critics of alternative therapies believe that the term &quot;alternative medicine&quot; is misleading. Some advocates believe that Western therapies are the &quot;alternative&quot; in that they were preceded by traditional therapies. Others believe that the term was invented by advocates of &quot;allopathic&quot; medicine in an attempt to discredit natural therapies [http://www.quackpotwatch.org/]. Critics of alternative therapies assert that they are not effective and consequently are not a legitimate alternative to [[conventional medicine]]. [[Richard Dawkins]], professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University, defines alternative medicine as ''&quot;that set of practices that cannot be tested, refuse to be tested or consistently fail tests&quot;'' (See Diamond 2003). Many on both sides believe that alternative therapies can become accepted as conventional medicine if they are scientifically proven to be effective.

==Complementary and alternative medicine== 

The [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] defines [[complementary and alternative medicine]] as &quot;a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine&quot;.  One distinction that the NCCAM makes is that complementary medicine is used in conjunction with conventional medicine whereas alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine.  The NCCAM also defines integrative medicine as the combination of &quot;mainstream medical therapies and CAM therapies for which there is some high-quality scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness&quot;.

&quot;''Importantly, integrative medicine is not synonymous with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). It has a far larger meaning and mission in that it calls for restoration of the focus of medicine on health and healing and emphasizes the centrality of the patient-physician relationship.&quot;'' (Snyderman, Weil 2002)

==Regulation==
[[Jurisdiction]] differs concerning which branches of alternative medicine are legal, which are regulated, and which (if any) are provided by a government-controlled [[Publicly_funded_medicine | health service]] or reimbursed by a [[ Health_insurance |private health medical insurance company]].

A number of alternative medicine advocates disagree with the restrictions of government agencies that approve medical treatments (such as the American [[Food and Drug Administration]]) and the agencies' adherence to experimental evaluation methods. They claim that this impedes those seeking to bring useful and effective treatments and approaches to the public, and protest that their contributions and discoveries are unfairly dismissed, overlooked or suppressed. Alternative medicine providers often argue that health fraud should be dealt with appropriately when it occurs.

==Contemporary use of alternative medicine==
[[Edzard Ernst]] wrote in the [[Medical Journal of Australia]] that &quot;''about half the general population in developed countries use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)''&quot; (Ernst 2003). A  [http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2004/052704.htm survey] (Barnes et al 2004) released in May 2004 by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the United States, found that in 2002, 36% of Americans used some form of alternative therapy in the past 12 months &amp;mdash; a category that included yoga, meditation, herbal treatments and the [[Atkins diet]]. If [[prayer]] was counted as an alternative therapy, the figure rose to 62.1%. Another study by Astin et al (1998) suggests a similar figure of 40%. A British telephone survey by the BBC of 1209 adults in 1998 shows that around 20% of adults in Britain had used alternative medicine in the past 12 months (Ernst &amp; White 1999)

The use of alternative medicine appears to be increasing. Eisenburg et al carried out a study in 1998 which showed that use of alternative medicine had risen from 33.8% in 1990 to 42.1% in 1997. In the United Kingdom, a [[2000]] report ordered by the [[House of Lords]] suggested that &quot;limited data seem to support the idea that CAM use in the United Kingdom is high and is increasing&quot;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/123/12301.htm].

===Medical education===
Increasing numbers of medical colleges have begun offering courses in alternative medicine. For example, the [[University of Arizona]] College of Medicine offers a program in [[Integrative Medicine]] under the leadership of [[Andrew Weil|Dr. Andrew Weil]] which trains physicians in various branches of alternative medicine which &quot;''neither rejects conventional medicine, nor embraces alternative practices uncritically.''&quot; [http://www.ahsc.arizona.edu/opa/horizons/1997/integrate.htm] In three separate research surveys that surveyed the 125 medical schools offering a MD degree, the 19 medical schools offering a DO degree, and 585 schools of nursing in the United States: 60 percent of U.S. medical schools offering a MD degree teach CAM, 95% of Osteopathic medical school teach CAM, and 84.8% of US schools of nursing teach CAM. (Wetzel et al 1998, Saxon et al 2004, Fenton &amp; Morris 2003)

In the UK, no medical schools offer courses that teach the clinical practise of alternative medicine. However, alternative medicine is taught in several schools as part of the curriculum. Teaching is based mostly on theory and understanding alternative medicine, with emphasis on being able to communicate with alternative medicine specialists. To obtain competence in practising clinical alternative medicine, qualifications must be obtained from individual medical societies. The student must have graduated and be a qualified doctor. The [http://www.medical-acupuncture.co.uk British Medical Acupuncture Society], which offers medical acupuncture certificates to doctors, is one such example.

== Support for alternative medicine ==
Advocates of alternative medicine hold that alternative therapies often provide the public with services not available from conventional medicine.  This argument covers a range of areas, such as [[patient empowerment]], alternative methods of [[pain management]], treatment methods that support the [[biopsychosocial model]] of health, stress reduction services, other preventive health services that are not typically a part of conventional medicine, and of course complementary medicine's [[palliative care]] which is practiced by such world renowned cancer centers such as [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center|Memorial Sloan-Kettering]] (see Vickers 2004).

===Efficacy===
Advocates of alternative medicine hold that the various alternative treatment methods are effective in treating a wide range of major and minor medical conditions, and contend that recently published research (such as Michalsen 2003, Gonsalkorale 2003, and Berga 2003) proves the effectiveness of specific alternative treatments.  They assert that a PubMed search revealed over 370,000 research papers classified as alternative medicine published in Medline-recognized journals since 1966 in the National Library of Medicine database (such as Kleijnen 1991, Linde 1997, Michalsen 2003, Gonsalkorale  2003, and Berga 2003).

Advocates of alternative medicine hold that alternative medicine may provide health benefits through [[patient empowerment]], by offering more choices to the public, including treatments that are simply not available in conventional medicine.

''&quot;Most Americans who consult alternative providers would probably jump at the chance to consult a physician who is well trained in scientifically based medicine and who is also open-minded and knowledgeable about the body's innate mechanisms of healing, the role of lifestyle factors in influencing health, and the appropriate uses of dietary supplements, herbs, and other forms of treatment, from osteopathic manipulation to Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine. In other words, they want competent help in navigating the confusing maze of therapeutic options that are available today, especially in those cases in which conventional approaches are relatively ineffective or harmful.&quot;'' (Snyderman, Weil 2002) 

Some physicians are willing to embrace some aspects of alternative medicine.

Although advocates of alternative medicine acknowledge that the [[placebo effect]] may play a role in the benefits that some receive from alternative therapies, they point out that this does not diminish their validity. Skeptics are confounded by this view and claim that it is acknowledgement of the inefficacy of alternative treatments.

===Danger reduced when used as a complement to conventional medicine===
A major objection to alternative medicine is that it may be done in place of conventional medical treatments. As long as alternative treatments are used alongside standard conventional medical treatments, most medical doctors find most forms of complementary medicine acceptable (Vickers 2004). Consistent with previous studies,  the CDC recently reported that the majority of individuals in the United States (i.e., 54.9%) used CAM in conjunction with conventional medicine. (CDC Advance Data Report #343, 2002) 

Patients should however always inform their medical doctor they are using alternative medicine. Some patients do not tell their medical doctors since they fear it will hurt their patient-doctor relationship. However some alternative treatments may interact with orthodox medical treatments. 

The issue of alternative medicine interfering with conventional medical practices is minimized when it is only turned to after the conventional medicine path has been exhausted. Many patients believe alternative medicine can help in coping with chronic illnesses for which conventional medicine offers no cure and only management.  It is becoming more common for a patient's own MD to suggest alternatives when they cannot offer a treatment.

== Criticism of alternative medicine ==

Due to the wide range of therapies that are considered to be &quot;alternative medicine&quot; few criticisms apply across the board.  For more information about a particular therapy or branch of alternative medicine, including specific criticism, please refer to the following link:  [[List of branches of alternative medicine]].

Criticisms directed at specific branches of alternative medicine range from the fairly minor (conventional treament is believed to be more effective in a particular area) to incompatibility with the known laws of physics (for example, in [[homeopathy]]).

Proponents of the various forms of alternative medicine reject criticism as being founded in prejudice, financial self-interest, or ignorance.

===Efficacy===

====Lack of proper testing====
Despite the large number of studies regarding alternative therapies, critics contend that there are no statistics on exactly how many of these studies were controlled, double-blind peer-reviewed experiments or how many produced results supporting alternative medicine or parts thereof.  They contend that many forms of alternative medicine are rejected by conventional medicine because the efficacy of the treatments has not been demonstrated through double-blind [[randomized controlled trial]]s. Some skeptics of alternative practices point out that a person may attribute symptomatic relief to an otherwise ineffective therapy due to the natural recovery from or the cyclical nature of an illness, the [[placebo effect]], or the possibility that the person never originally had a true illness [http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/altpsych.html].

====Problems with known tests and studies====
Critics contend that observer bias and poor study design invalidate the results of many studies carried out by alternative medicine promoters.

A review of the effectiveness of certain alternative medicine techniques for cancer treatment (Vickers 2004), while finding that most of these treatments are not merely &quot;unproven&quot; but are proven not to work, notes that several studies have found evidence that the [[psychosocial treatment]] of patients by [[psychologist]]s is linked to survival advantages (although it comments that these results are not consistently replicated). The same review, while specifically noting that &quot;complementary therapies for cancer-related symptoms were not part of this review&quot;, cites studies indicating that several complementary therapies can provide benefits by, for example, reducing pain and improving the mood of patients.

Some argue that less research is carried out on alternative medicine because many alternative medicine techniques cannot be patented, and hence there is little financial incentive to study them. Drug research, by contrast, can be very lucrative, which has resulted in funding of trials by pharmaceutical companies. Many people, including conventional and alternative medical practitioners, contend that this funding has led to corruption of the scientific process for approval of drug usage, and that ghostwritten work has appeared in major [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] medical journals. (Flanagin ''et al.'' 1998, Larkin 1999).  Increasing the funding for research of alternative medicine techniques was the purpose of the [[U.S. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]].  NCCAM and its predecessor, the Office of Alternative Medicine, have spent more than $200 million on such research since 1991.  The German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices [[Commission E]] has studied many herbal remedies for efficacy.    [http://www.csicop.org/si/2003-09/alternative-medicine.html]

===Safety===
Critics contend that &quot;dubious therapies can cause death, serious injury, unnecessary suffering, and disfigurement&quot; [http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/harmquack.html] and that some people have been hurt or killed directly from the various practices or indirectly by failed diagnoses or the subsequent avoidance of conventional medicine which they believe is truly efficacious [http://www.valleyskeptic.com/perrot.htm]. 

Alternative medicine critics agree with its proponents that people should be free to choose whatever method of healthcare they want, but stipulate that people must be informed as to the safety and efficacy of whatever method they choose. People who choose alternative medicine may think they are choosing a safe, effective medicine, while they may only be getting [[quackery|quack]] remedies.

====Delay in seeking conventional medical treatment====
They state that those who have had success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious, possibly life-threatening illness. For this reason, they contend that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous.

==== Danger can be increased when used as a complement to conventional medicine ====
A Norwegian multicentre study examined the association between the use of alternative medicines (AM) and cancer survival. 515 patients using standard medical care for cancer were followed for eight years. 22% of those patients used AM concurrently with their standard care.

The study revealed that death rates were 30% higher in AM users than in those who did not use AM: &quot;The use of AM seems to predict a shorter survival from cancer.&quot; -- [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;list_uids=12565991&amp;dopt=Citation Does use of alternative medicine predict survival from cancer?]
Eur J Cancer 2003 Feb;39(3):372-7

Associate Professor Alastair MacLennan of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Adelaide University, Australia reports that a patient of his almost bled to death on the operating table. She had failed to mention she had been taking &quot;natural&quot; potions to &quot;build up her strength&quot; for the operation - one of them turned out to be a powerful anticoagulant which nearly 
caused her death.

====Issues of regulation====
Critics contend that some branches of alternative medicine are often not properly regulated in some countries to identify who practices or know what training or expertise they may possess. Critics argue that the governmental regulation of any particular alternative therapy does necessitate that the therapy is effective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[geometry]] an '''Archimedean solid''' or [[semiregular polyhedra|'''semi-regular solid''']] is  a semi-regular [[convex]] [[polyhedron]] composed of two or more types of [[polygon|regular polygon]] meeting in identical [[vertex|vertices]]. They are distinct from the [[Platonic solid]]s, which are composed of only one type of polygon meeting in identical vertices, and from the [[Johnson solid]]s, whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices. 

==Origin of name==

The Archimedean solids take their name from [[Archimedes]], who discussed them in a now-lost work. During the [[Renaissance]], [[artist]]s and [[mathematician]]s valued ''pure forms'' and rediscovered all of these forms. This search was completed around [[1619]] by [[Johannes Kepler]], who defined prisms, antiprisms, and the non-convex solids known as [[Kepler-Poinsot solid]]s. 

==Classification==

There are 13 Archimedean solids (15 if the [[mirror image]]s of two [[chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorph]]s, see below, are counted separately). Here the ''vertex configuration'' refers to the type of regular polygons that meet at any given vertex. For example, a vertex configuration of (4,6,8) means that a square, hexagon, and octagon meet at a vertex (with the order taken to be clockwise around the vertex).

The number of vertices is 720° divided by the vertex [[Defect (geometry)|angle defect]].

The cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron are edge-uniform and are called quasi-regular.

The snub cube and snub dodecahedron are known as ''chiral'', as they come in a left-handed (Latin: levomorph or laevomorph) form and right-handed (Latin: dextromorph) form. When something comes in multiple forms which are each other's three-dimensional [[mirror image]], these forms may be called enantiomorphs.  (This nomenclature is also used for the forms of [[chemical compound]]s).

The [[dual polyhedron|duals]] of the Archimedean solids are called the [[Catalan solid|Catalan solids]].  Together with the [[bipyramid|bipyramids]] and [[trapezohedron|trapezohedra]], these are the face-uniform solids with regular vertices.

An ''n''-sided '''antiprism''' is a [[polyhedron]] composed of two parallel copies of some particular ''n''-sided [[polygon]], connected by an alternating band of [[triangle]]s.

Antiprisms are a subclass of the [[prismatoid]]s.

Antiprisms are similar to [[prism (geometry)|prism]]s except the bases are twisted relative to each other: the vertices are symmetrically staggered.

In the case of a regular ''n''-sided base, one usually considers the case where its copy is twisted by an angle 180°/n. Extra regularity is obtained by the line connecting the base centers being perpendicular to the base planes, making it a '''right antiprism'''. It has, apart from the base faces, 2''n'' isosceles triangles as faces. 

A '''[[Uniform_polyhedron|uniform]] antiprism''' has, apart from the base faces, 2''n'' equilateral triangles as faces. They form an infinite series of vertex-uniform polyhedra, as do the uniform prisms. For ''n''=2 we have as degenerate case the regular [[tetrahedron]].

* (linear antiprism) [[Tetrahedron]] - 4 triangles - self dual
* (trigonal antiprism) [[Octahedron]] - 8 triangles - dual [[cube]]
* [[Square antiprism]] - 8 triangles, 2 squares - dual [[tetragonal trapezohedron]]
* [[Pentagonal antiprism]] - 10 triangles, 2 pentagons - dual [[pentagonal trapezohedron]]
* [[Hexagonal antiprism]] - 12 triangles, 2 hexagons - dual [[hexagonal trapezohedron]]
* ''Septagonal antiprism'' - 14 triangles, 2 septagons - dual [[septagonal trapezohedron]]
* [[Octagonal antiprism]] - 16 triangles, 2 octagons - dual [[octagonal trapezohedron]]
* ...
* [[Decagonal antiprism]] - 20 triangles, 2 decagons - dual [[decagonal trapezohedron]]
* ...
* [[Dodecagonal antiprism]] - 24 triangles, 2 dodecagons - dual [[dodecagonal trapezohedron]]
* ...
* '''n-agonal antiprism''' - 2n triangles, 2 n-agons - dual [[trapezohedron|n-agonal trapezohedron]]

If ''n''=3 then we only have triangles; we get the [[octahedron]], a particular type of right triangular antiprism which is also edge- and face-uniform, and so counts among the [[Platonic solid]]s.  The [[dual polyhedron|dual polyhedra]] of the antiprisms are the [[trapezohedron|trapezohedra]]. Their existence was first discussed and their name was coined by [[Johannes Kepler]].

== Cartesian coordinates ==
[[Cartesian coordinates]] for the vertices of a right antiprism with ''n''-gonal bases and isosceles triangles are
: &lt;math&gt;( \cos(k\pi/n), \sin(k\pi/n), (-1)^k a )\;&lt;/math&gt;
with ''k'' ranging from 0 to 2''n''-1; if the triangles are equilateral,
:&lt;math&gt;2a^2=\cos(\pi/n)-\cos(2\pi/n)\;&lt;/math&gt;.

== Symmetry ==
The [[symmetry group]] of a right ''n''-sided antiprism with regular base and isosceles side faces is ''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'' of order 4''n'',  except in the case of a tetrahedron, which has the larger symmetry group '''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''' of order 24, which has three versions of ''D&lt;sub&gt;2d&lt;/sub&gt;'' as subgroups, and the octahedron, which has the larger symmetry group '''O&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''' of order 48, which has four versions of ''D&lt;sub&gt;3d&lt;/sub&gt;'' as subgroups.

The symmetry group contains [[inversion]] [[iff]] ''n'' is odd.

The [[rotation group]] is ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of order 2''n'',  except in the case of a tetrahedron, which has the larger rotation group '''T''' of order 12, which has three versions of ''D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' as subgroups, and the octahedron, which has the larger rotation group '''O''' of order 24, which has four versions of ''D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' as subgroups.

== Star antiprisms ==

Uniform antiprisms can also be constructed on [[star polygon]]s: {''n''/''m''} = {5/2}, {7/3}, {7/4}, {8/3}, {9/2}, {9/4}, {10/3}...

For any [[coprime]] pair of integers ''n,m'' such that 2''m'' &lt; ''n'', there are two forms:
* a normal '''antiprism''' with vertex configuration ''3.3.3.n/m'';
* a '''crossed antiprism''' with vertex configuration ''3.3.3.n/(n-m)''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Flora===
The vegetation of [[Africa]] follows very closely the distribution of heat and moisture.  The northern and southern temperate zones have a flora distinct from that of the continent generally, which is tropical.  In the countries bordering the [[Mediterranean]] are groves of [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s and [[olive]] trees, evergreen [[oak]]s, [[cork oak|cork]] trees and [[pine]]s, intermixed with [[cupressus|cypresses]], [[myrtle]]s, [[arbutus]] and fragrant [[Erica|tree-heaths]].  

South of the [[Atlas mountains|Atlas]] range the conditions alter.  The zones of minimum rainfall have a very scanty flora, consisting of plants adapted to resist the great dryness.  Characteristic of the [[Sahara]] is the [[date palm]], which flourishes where other vegetation can scarcely maintain existence, while in the semidesert regions the [[acacia]] (whence is obtained gum-arabic) is abundant.  

The more humid regions have a richer vegetation; dense forest where the rainfall is greatest and variations of temperature least, conditions found chiefly on the tropical coasts, and in the west African equatorial basin with its extension towards the upper [[Nile]]; and [[savanna]] interspersed with trees on the greater part of the plateaus, passing as the desert regions are approached into a scrub vegetation consisting of thorny acacias, etc. Forests also occur on the humid slopes of mountain ranges up to a certain elevation. In the coast regions the typical tree is the [[mangrove]], which flourishes wherever the soil is of a [[swamp]] character.  

The dense [[forest]]s of West Africa contain, in addition to a great variety of [[hardwood]]s, two [[Arecaceae|palms]], ''Elaeis guincensis'' ([[oil palm]]) and ''Raphia vinifera'' ([[bamboo palm]]), not found, generally speaking, in the savanna regions. ''[[Bombax]]'' or silk-cotton trees attain gigantic proportions in the forests, which are the home of the india rubber-producing plants and of many valuable kinds of timber trees, such as [[odum]] (''Chlorophora excelsa''), [[ebony]], [[mahogany]] (''Khaya senegalensis''), [[Oldfieldia]] (''Oldfieldia africana'') and [[camwood]] (''Baphia nitida''). The climbing plants in the tropical forests are exceedingly luxuriant and the undergrowth or &quot;bush&quot; is extremely dense.  

In the savannas the most characteristic trees are the monkey bread tree or [[baobab]] (''Adanisonia digitata''), [[doom palm]] (''Hyphaene'') and [[euphorbia]]s. The [[coffee]] plant grows wild in such widely separated places as [[Liberia]] and southern [[Abyssinia]]. The higher mountains have a special flora showing close agreement over wide intervals of space, as well as affinities with the mountain flora of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Himalaya]] and [[Indo-China]].

In the swamp regions of north-east Africa [[papyrus]] and associated plants, including the soft-wooded [[ambach]], flourish in immense quantities, and little else is found in the way of vegetation. South Africa is largely destitute of forest save in the lower valleys and coast regions. Tropical flora disappears, and in the semi-desert plains the fleshy, leafless, contorted species of [[kapsia]]s, [[mesembryanthemum]]s, [[aloe]]s and other succulent plants make their appearance. There are, too, valuable timber trees, such as the [[Podocarpus|Yellow-wood]] (''Podocarpus elongatus''), [[stinkwood]] (''Ocotea''), [[sneezewood]] or [[Cape ebony]] (''Pteroxylon utile'') and ironwood. Extensive miniature woods of heaths are found in almost endless variety and covered throughout the greater part of the year with innumerable blossoms in which red is very prevalent. Of the grasses of Africa alfa is very abundant in the plateaus of the Atlas range.

===Fauna===
The fauna again shows the effect of the characteristics of the vegetation.  The open savannas are the home of large [[ungulate]]s, especially [[antelope]]s, the [[giraffe]] (peculiar to Africa), [[zebra]], [[Cape_buffalo|buffalo]], wild [[donkey|ass]] and four species of [[rhinoceros]]; and of carnivores, such as the [[lion]], [[leopard]], [[hyena]], etc. The [[okapi]] (a genus restricted to Africa) is found only in the dense forests of the [[Congo River|Congo]] basin. [[Bear]]s are confined to the Atlas region, [[wolf|wolves]] and [[fox]]es to North Africa. The [[elephant]] (though its range has become restricted through the attacks of hunters) is found both in the savannas and forest regions, the latter being otherwise poor in large game, though the special habitat of the [[chimpanzee]] and [[gorilla]]. [[Baboon]]s and [[mandrill]]s, with few exceptions, are peculiar to Africa. The single-humped [[camel]], as a domestic animal, is 
especially characteristic of the northern deserts and steppes. 

The rivers in the tropical zone abound with [[hippopotamus|hippopotami]] and [[crocodile]]s, the former entirely confined to Africa. The vast herds of game, formerly so characteristic of many parts of Africa, have much diminished with the increase of intercourse with the interior. Game reserves have, however, been established in [[South Africa]], [[British Central Africa]], [[British East Africa]], [[Somahland]], etc., while measures for the protection of wild animals were laid down in an international convention signed in May 1900. 

The [[ornithology]] of northern Africa presents a close resemblance to that of southern Europe, scarcely a species being found which does not also occur in the other countries bordering the Mediterranean. Among the birds most characteristic of Africa are the [[ostrich]] and the [[secretary-bird]]. The ostrich is widely dispersed, but is found chiefly in the [[desert]] and [[steppe]] regions. The secretary-bird is common in the south.  The [[weaver bird]]s and their allies, including the [[long-tailed whydah]]s, are abundant, as are, among game-birds, the [[francolin]] and [[guineafowl]]. Many of the smaller birds, such as the [[sunbird]]s, [[bee-eater]]s, the [[parrot]]s and [[kingfisher]]s, as well as the larger [[plantain-eater]]s, are noted for the brilliance of their plumage.  

Of [[reptile]]s the [[lizard]] and [[chameleon]] are common, and there are a number of venomous [[snake]]s, though these are not so numerous as in other tropical countries.  

The [[scorpion]] is abundant. Of [[insect]]s Africa has many thousand different kinds; of these the [[locust]] is the proverbial scourge of the continent, and the ravages of the [[termite]]s are almost incredible. The spread of [[malaria]] by means of [[mosquito]]es is common. The [[tsetse fly]], whose bite is fatal to all domestic animals, is common in many districts of South and East Africa. Fortunately it is found nowhere outside Africa.

{{commonscat|Maps of Africa}}
'''[[Africa]]''' is a [[continent]] comprised of 61 political territories (including 53 [[United Nations member states|countries]]), representing the largest of the three great southward projections from the main mass of [[Earth]]'s surface. It includes, within its remarkably regular outline, an area of 30,368,609 [[square kilometre|km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] (11,725,385 [[square mile|mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]), including adjacent islands. 

Separated from [[Europe]] by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and from much of [[Asia]] by the [[Red Sea]], Africa is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (which is transected by the [[Suez Canal]]), 130 km (80 miles) wide.  For [[geopolitical]] purposes, the [[Sinai Peninsula]] of [[Egypt]] – east of the Suez Canal – is often considered part of Africa.  From the most northerly point, Ras ben Sakka in [[Morocco]], a little west of [[Cape Blanc]], in 37°21′ N, to the most southerly point, [[Cape Agulhas]] in [[South Africa]], 34°51′15″ S, is a distance approximately of 8,000 km (5,000 miles); from [[Cape Verde]], 17°33′22″ W, the westernmost point, to Ras Hafun in [[Somalia]], 51°27′52″ E, the most easterly projection, is a distance (also approximately) of 7,400 km (4,600 miles).  The length of coast-line is 26,000 km (16,100 miles) and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is shown by the fact that Europe, which covers only [[1 E12 m²|9,700,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] (3,760,000 square miles), has a coastline of 32,000 km (19,800 miles). 

The main structural lines of the continent show both the east-to-west direction characteristic, at least in the eastern hemisphere, of the more northern parts of the world, and the north-to-south direction seen in the southern peninsulas.  [[Africa]] is thus composed of two segments at right angles, the northern running from east to west, the southern from north to south, the subordinate lines corresponding in the main to these two directions.

=== Main Geographical Features ===
[[Image:Africa satellite plane.jpg|thumb|300px|]]

The average elevation of the continent approximates closely to 600 m (2,000 ft), which is roughly the elevation of both [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], but is considerably less than that of [[Asia]], 950 m (3,117 ft).  In contrast with the other continents it is marked by the comparatively small area both of very high and of very low ground, lands under 180 m (600 ft) occupying an unusually small part of the surface; while not only are the highest elevations inferior to those of Asia and South America, but the area of land over 3,000 m (10,000 ft) is also quite insignificant, being represented almost entirely by individual peaks and mountain ranges.  Moderately elevated tablelands are thus the characteristic feature of the continent, though the surface of these is broken by higher peaks and ridges. (So prevalent are these isolated peaks and 
ridges that a special term [Inselberg-landschaft] has been adopted in [[Germany]] to describe this kind of country, which is thought to be in great part the result of wind action.) 

As a general rule, the higher tablelands lie to the east and south, while a progressive diminution in altitude towards the west and north is observable.  Apart from the lowlands and the [[Atlas mountains|Atlas mountain]] range, the continent may be divided into two regions of higher and lower plateaus, the dividing line (somewhat concave to the north-west) running from the middle of the [[Red Sea]] to about 6 deg.  S. on the west coast.  

Africa can be divided into a number of geographic zones:
*The coast plains - often fringed seawards by mangrove swamps - never stretching far from the coast, except on the lower courses of streams.  Recent alluvial flats are found chiefly in the delta of the more important rivers.  Elsewhere the coast lowlands merely form the lowest steps of the system of terraces which constitutes the ascent to the inner plateaus. 
*The [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas range]], which, orographically, is distinct from the rest of the continent, being unconnected with any other area of high ground, and separated from the rest of the continent on the south by a depressed and desert area (the [[Sahara]]), in places below sea-level.

===Plateau region===
[[Image:topography of africa.jpg|thumb|320px|Topography of Africa]]
The high southern and eastern plateaus, rarely falling below 600 m (2000 ft), and having a mean elevation of about 1000 m (3500 ft).   The [[South African plateau]] as far as about 12° S, bounded east, west and south by bands of high ground which fall steeply to the coasts.  On this account South Africa has a general resemblance to an inverted saucer.  Due south the plateau rim is formed by three parallel steps with level ground between them.  The largest of these level areas, the [[Great Karoo]], is a dry, barren region, and a large tract of the plateau proper is of a still more arid character and is known as the [[Kalahari Desert]].

The South African plateau is connected towards the north-east with the [[East African plateau]], with probably a slightly greater average elevation, and marked by some distinct features.  It is formed by a widening out of the eastern axis of high ground, which becomes subdivided into a number of zones running north and south and consisting in turn of ranges, tablelands and depressions.  The most striking feature is the existence of two great lines of depression, due largely to the subsidence of whole segments of the earth's crust, the lowest parts of which are occupied by vast lakes.  Towards 
the south the two lines converge and give place to one great valley (occupied by [[Lake Nyasa]]), the southern part of which is less distinctly due to rifting and subsidence than the rest of the system.  

Farther north the western depression, known as the [[Great Rift Valley]] is occupied for more than half its length by water, forming the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes]] lakes of [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]], [[Lake Kivu|Kivu]], [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake Albert, Africa|Lake Albert]], the first-named over 400 miles (600 km) long and the longest freshwater lake in the world.  Associated with these great valleys are a number of volcanic peaks, the greatest of which occur on a meridional line east of the eastern trough.  The eastern depression, known as the East African trough or rift-valley, contains much smaller lakes, many of them [[brackish water|brackish]] and without outlet, the only one comparable to those of the western trough being [[Lake Rudolf]] or Basso Norok.  

At no great distance east of this rift-valley are [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] - with its two peaks Kibo and Mawenzi, the former 5889 m (19,321 ft), and the culminating point of the whole continent - and [[Mount Kenya]], 5184 m (17,007 ft).  Hardly less important is the [[Ruwenzori Range]], over 5060 m (16,600 ft), which lies east of the western trough.  Other volcanic peaks rise from the floor of the valleys, some of the Kirunga (Mfumbiro) group, north of Lake Kivu, being still partially active.

The third division of the higher region of Africa is formed by the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], a rugged mass of mountains forming the largest continuous area of its altitude in the whole continent, little of its surface falling below 1500 m (5000 ft), while the summits reach heights of 4600 m to 4900 m (15,000 to 16,000 ft).  This block of country lies just west of the line of the great East African Trough, the northern continuation of which passes along its eastern escarpment as it runs up to join the Red Sea. There is, however, in the centre a circular basin occupied by [[Lake Tsana]].

Both in the east and west of the continent the bordering highlands are continued as strips of plateau parallel to the coast, the Ethiopian mountains being continued northwards along the Red Sea coast by a series of ridges reaching in places a height of 2000 m (7000 ft).  In the west the zone of high land is broader but somewhat lower.  The most mountainous districts lie inland from the head of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] (Adamawa, etc.), where heights of 1800 m to 2400 m (6000 to 8000 ft) are reached.  Exactly at the head of the gulf the great peak of the Cameroon, on a line of volcanic action continued 
by the islands to the south-west, has a height of 4075 m (13,370 ft), while Clarence Peak, in [[Fernando Po]], the first of the line of islands, rises to over 2700 m (9000 ft).  Towards the extreme west the Futa Jallon highlands form an important diverging point of rivers, but beyond this, as far as the Atlas chain, the elevated rim of the continent is almost wanting.

==Plains==
The area between the east and west coast highlands, which north of 17° N is mainly desert, is divided into separate basins by other bands of high ground, one of which runs nearly centrally through North Africa in a line corresponding roughly with the curved axis of the continent as a whole.  The best marked of the basins so formed (the [[Congo River|Congo]] basin) occupies a circular area bisected by the equator, once probably the site of an inland sea.  

Running along the south of desert is the plains region known as the [[Sahel]].

The arid region, the [[Sahara Desert|Sahara]] &amp;mdash; the largest desert in the world, covering 9,000,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (3,500,000 square miles) &amp;mdash; extends from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the Red Sea. Though generally of slight elevation it contains mountain ranges with peaks rising to 2400 m (8000 ft)  Bordered N.W. by the Atlas range, to the northeast a rocky plateau separates it from the [[Mediterranean]]; this plateau gives place at the extreme east to the delta of the Nile.  That river (see below) pierces the desert without modifying its character.  The [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas range]], the north-westerly part of the continent, between its seaward and landward heights encloses elevated steppes in places 160 km (100 miles) broad.  From the inner slopes of the plateau numerous wadis take a direction towards the Sahara.  The greater part of that now desert region is, indeed, furrowed by old water-channels. 

The following table gives the approximate altitudes of the chief mountains and lakes of the continent:

* [[List of National Parks in Africa]]

=== The Hydrographic Systems ===

From the outer margin of the African plateaus a large number of streams run to the sea with comparatively short courses, while the larger rivers flow for long distances on the interior highlands before breaking through the outer ranges.  The main drainage of the continent is to the north and west, or towards the basin of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  

The high lake plateau of East Africa contains the head-waters of the [[Nile]] and [[Congo River|Congo]]: the former the longest, the latter the largest river of the continent.  The upper Nile receives its chief supplies from the mountainous region adjoining the Central African trough in the neighbourhood of the equator.  Thence streams pour east to [[Lake Victoria]], the largest African lake (covering over 26,000 square m.), and west and north to [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake Albert]], to the latter of which the effluents of the other two lakes add their waters.  Issuing from it the Nile flows north, and between 7 deg.  and 10 deg.  N. traverses a vast marshy level during which its course is liable to blocking by floating vegetation.  After receiving the Bahr-el-Ghazal from the west and the [[Sobat River|Sobat]], [[Blue Nile]] and [[Atbarah River|Atbara]] from the Ethiopian highlands (the chief gathering ground of the flood-water), it crosses the great desert and enters the Mediterranean by a vast delta.  

The most remote head-stream of the Congo is the [[Chambezi River|Chambezi]], which flows south-west into the marshy [[Lake Bangweulu]].  From this lake issues the Congo, known in its upper course by various names.  Flowing first south, it afterwards turns north through [[Lake Mweru]] and descends to the forest-clad basin of west equatorial Africa.  Traversing this in a majestic northward curve and receiving vast supplies of water from many great tributaries, it finally turns south-west and cuts a way to the Atlantic Ocean through the western highlands.  

North of the Congo basin and separated from it by a broad undulation of the surface is the basin of [[Lake Chad]] - a flat-shored, shallow lake filled principally by the Shad coming from the south-east.  West of this is the basin of the [[Niger River|Niger]], the third river of Africa, which, though flowing to the Atlantic, has its principal source in the far west, and reverses the direction of flow exhibited by the Nile and Congo.  An important branch, however - the [[Benue River|Benue]] - comes from the south-east.  These four river-basins occupy the greater part of the lower plateaus of North and West Africa, the remainder consisting of arid regions watered only by intermittent streams which do not reach the sea.

Of the remaining rivers of the Atlantic basin the [[Orange River|Orange]], in the extreme south, brings the drainage from the [[Drakensberg]] on the opposite side of the 
continent, while the Kunene, Kwanza, Ogowe and Sanaga drain the west corst highlands of the southern limb; the [[Volta]], Komoe, Bandama, [[Gambia River|Gambia]] and [[Senegal River|Senegal]] the highlands of the western limb.  North of the Senegal for over 1000 miles (1600 km) of coast the arid region reaches to the Atlantic.  Farther north are the 
streams, with comparatively short courses, which reach the Atlantic and Mediterranean from the Atlas mountains. 

Of the rivers flowing to the [[Indian Ocean]] the only one draining any large part of the interior plateaus is the [[Zambezi]], whose western branches rise in the west coast highlands.  The main stream has its rise in 11°21′3″ S 24°22′ E at an elevation of 5000 ft.  It flows west and south for a considerable distance before turning to the east.  All the largest tributaries, including the Shire, the outflow of [[Lake Nyasa]], flow down the southern slopes of the band of high ground which stretches across the conbnent in 10 deg.  to 12 deg.  S. In the south-west the Zambezi system interlaces with that of the [[Taukhe River|Taukhe]] (or Tioghe), from which it at times receives surplus water.  The rest of the water of the Taukhe, known in its middle course as the [[Okavango River|Okavango]], is lost in a system of swamps and saltpans which formerly centred in [[Lake Ngami]], now dried up.  

Farther south the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] drains a portion of the interior plateau but breaks through the bounding highlands on the side of the continent nearest its source.  The [[Rovuma River|Rovuma]], [[Rufiji River|Rufiji]], [[Tana River|Tana]], [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and [[Webi Shebeli River|Webi Shebeli]] principally drain the outer slopes of the East African highlands, the last named losing itself in the sands in close proximity to the sea.  Another large stream, the [[Hawash river|Hawash]], rising in the Ethiopian mountains, is lost in a saline depression near the Gulf of Aden.  

Lastly, between the basins of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans there is an area of inland drainage along the centre of the East African plateau, directed chiefly into the lakes in the great rift-valley.  The largest river is the [[Omo river|Omo]], which, fed by the rains of the Ethiopian highlands, carries down a large body of water into [[Lake Rudolf]].  The rivers of Africa are generally obstructed either by bars at their mouths or by cataracts at no great distance up-stream.  But when these obstacles have been overcome the rivers and lakes afford a network of navigable waters of vast extent. 

The calculation of the areas of African drainage systems, made by Dr A. Bludau (Petermanns Mitteilungen, 43, 1897, pp. 184-186) gives the following general results:
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
!    ||mi² || Mm²
|-
| Basin of the Atlantic || 4,070,000 || 10.541
|-
| Basin of the Mediterranean || 1,680,000 || 4.351
|-
| Basin of the Indian Ocean || 2,086,000 || 5.403
|-
| Inland drainage area || 3,452,000 || 8.941
|}

The areas of individual river-basins are:
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
!  || mi² || Mm²
|-
| Congo, length over 3000 mi (4800 km) || 1,425,000 || 3.691

|-
| Niger, length about 2600 mi (4200 km) || 808,000 || 2.093

|-
| Orange (actual drainage area) || 172,500 || 0.447
|}

The area of the Congo basin is greater than that of any other river except the Amazon, while the African inland drainage area is greater than that of any continent but Asia, in which the corresponding area is 4,000,000 square miles (10 Mm²).

The principal African lakes have been mentioned in the description of the East African plateau, but some of the phenomena connected with them may be spoken of more particularly here.  As a rule the lakes which occupy portions of the great rift-valleys have steep sides and are very deep.  This is the case with the two largest of the type, Tanganyika and Nyasa, the latter of which has depths of 430 [[fathom]]s (790 m).  

Others, however, are shallow, and hardly, reach the steep sides of the valleys in the dry season.  Such are [[Lake Rukwa]], in a subsidiary depression north of Nyasa, and Eiassi and Manyara in the system of the eastern rift-valley.  Lakes of the broad type are of moderate depth, the deepest sounding in [[Lake Victoria]] being under 50 fathoms (90 m).  

Besides the East African lakes the principal are: - [[Lake Chad]], in the northern area of inland drainage; [[Lake Bangweulu|Bangweulu]] and [[Lake Mweru|Mweru]], traversed by the head-stream of the Congo; and [[Lake Mai-Ndombe]] and Ntomba (Mantumba), within the great bend of that river.  All, except possibly Mweru, are more or less shallow, and Chad appears to by drying up.  The altitudes of the African lakes have already been stated. 

Divergent opinions have been beld as to the mode of origin of the East African lakes, especially [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]], which some geologists have considered to represent an old arm of the sea, dating from a time when the whole central Congo basin was under water; others holding that the lake water has 
accumulated in a depression caused by subsidence.  The former view is based on the existence in the lake of organisms of a decidedly marine type.  They include a jelly-fish, molluscs, prawns, crabs, etc.

=== Islands ===

With one exception - [[Madagascar]] - the African islands are small.  Madagascar, with an area of 229,820 square miles (595,230 km²), is, after [[Greenland]], [[New Guinea]] and [[Borneo]], the largest island of the world. It lies off the S.E. coast of the continent, from which it is separated by the deep Mozambique channel, 250 miles (400 km) wide at its narrowest point.  Madagascar in its general structure, as in flora and fauna, forms a connecting link between Africa and southern Asia.  East of Madagascar are the small islands of [[Mauritius]] and [[Réunion]].  [[Socotra]] lies E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui.  Off the north-west coast are the [[Canary Islands|Canary]] and [[Cape Verde]] archipelagoes. which, like some small islands in the Gulf of Guinea, are of volcanic origin.

=== Climate and health ===

Lying almost entirely within the tropics, and equally to north and south of the equator, Africa does not show excessive variations of temperature.  

Great heat is experienced in the lower plains and desert regions of North Africa, removed by the great width of the continent from the influence of the ocean, and here, too, the contrast between day and night, and between summer and winter, is greatest. (The rarity of the air and the great radiation during the night cause the temperature in the Sahara to fall occasionally to freezing point.) 

Farther south, the heat is to some extent modified by the moisture brought from the ocean, and by the greater elevation of a large part of the surface, especially in East Africa, where the range of temperature is wider than in the Congo basin or on the Guinea coast.  

In the extreme north and south the climate is a warm temperate one, the northern countries being on the whole hotter and drier than those in the southern zone; the south of the continent being narrower than the north, the influence of the surrounding ocean is more felt.  

The most important climatic differences are due to variations in the amount of 
rainfall.  The wide heated plains of the Sahara, and in a lesser degree the corresponding zone of the Kalahari in the south, have an exceedingly scanty rainfall, the winds which blow over them from the ocean losing part of their moisture as they pass over the outer highlands, and becoming constantly drier owing to the heating effects of the burning soil of the interior; while the scarcity of mountain ranges in the more central parts likewise tends to prevent condensation.  In the inter-tropical zone of summer precipitation, the rainfall is greatest when the sun is vertical or soon after.  It is therefore greatest of all near the equator, where the sun is twice vertical, and less in the direction of both tropics.  

The rainfall zones are, however, somewhat deflected from a due west-to-east direction, the drier northern conditions extending southwards along the east coast, and those of the south northwards along the west.  Within the equatorial zone certain areas, especially on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea and in the upper Nile basin, have an intensified rainfall, but this rarely approaches that of the rainiest regions of the world.  The rainiest district in all Africa is a strip of coastland west of [[Mount Cameroon]], where there is a mean annual rainfall of about 390 in (9.91 m) as compared with a mean of 458 in (11.63 m) at [[Cherrapunji]], in [[Meghalaya]], [[India]]. 

The two distinct rainy seasons of the equatorial zone, where the sun is vertical at half-yearly intervals, become gradually merged into one in the direction of the tropics, where the sun is overhead but once.  Snow falls on all the higher mountain ranges, and on the highest the climate is thoroughly Alpine.  

The countries bordering the Sahara are much exposed to a very dry wind, full 
of fine particles of sand, blowing from the desert towards the sea.  Known in [[Egypt]] as the [[khamsin]], on the Mediterranean as the [[sirocco]], it is called on the Guinea coast the [[harmattan]].  This wind is not invariably hot; its great dryness causes so much evaporation that cold is not infrequently the result.  Similar dry winds blow from the [[Kalahari Desert]] in the south.  On the eastern coast the monsoons of the Indian Ocean are regularly felt, and on the southeast hurricanes are occasionally experienced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Approval ballot.svg|thumb|right|On an approval ballot, the voter can vote for any number of candidates.]]
'''Approval voting''' is a [[voting system]] used for [[election]]s, in which each voter can vote for as many or as few candidates as the voter chooses. It is typically used for single-winner elections, but can be extended to multiple winners. (However, multi-winner Approval voting does not return [[proportional representation|proportional]] results.) Approval voting is a limited form of [[range voting]], where the range that voters are allowed to express is extremely constrained: accept or not. 

It was advocated in 1968 and 1977 by [[Guy Ottewell]].  The term &quot;Approval voting&quot; was first coined by [[Robert J. Weber]] in 1976, but was fully devised in 1977 and published in 1978 by political scientist [[Steven Brams]] and mathematician [[Peter Fishburn]].  Historically, something resembling
Approval voting for candidates was used in the [[Republic of Venice]] during the 13th century and for elections in 19th century [[England]].  Also the UN uses a process similar to Approval Voting to elect the Secretary General.

==Procedures==
Each voter may vote for as many options as he or she chooses, at most once per option.  This is equivalent to saying that each voter may &quot;approve&quot; or &quot;disapprove&quot; each option by voting or not voting for it, and it's also equivalent to voting +1 or 0 in a range voting system.

The votes for each option are tallied.  The option with the most votes wins.

==Example==
{{Tenn_voting_example}}

Supposing that voters voted for their two favorite candidates, the results would be as follows (a more sophisticated approach to voting is discussed below):

*Memphis: 42 total votes
*Nashville: 68 total votes (wins)
*Chattanooga: 58 total votes
*Knoxville: 32 total votes

===Potential for tactical voting===
Approval voting passes the [[monotonicity criterion]], in that voting for a candidate never lowers that candidate's chance of winning.  Indeed, there is never a reason for a voter to [[tactical voting|tactically vote]] for a candidate X without voting for all candidates he or she prefers to candidate X. It is also never necessary for a voter to vote for a candidate liked ''less'' than X in order to elect X.

However, as approval voting does not offer a single method of expressing sincere preferences, but rather a plethora of them, voters are encouraged to analyze their fellow voters' preferences and use that information to decide which candidates to vote for. This feature of approval voting makes it difficult for theoreticians to predict how approval will play out in practice.

One possible tactic is that a voter will only approve of their first preference candidate; this will make it more difficult for other candidates to win. If every voter uses this tactic, then the election essentially turns into a [[first-past-the-post]] election, where the candidate with the largest plurality of first preference supporters wins.

One good tactic is to vote for every candidate the voter prefers to the leading candidate, and to also vote for the leading candidate if that candidate is preferred to the current second-place candidate.  When all voters use this tactic, there is a good chance that the [[Condorcet method|Condorcet winner]] will be elected. Approval voting fails to satisfy the [[Condorcet criterion]]. It is even possible that a Condorcet loser can be elected.

In the above election, if Chattanooga is perceived as the strongest challenger to Nashville, voters from Nashville will only vote for Nashville, because it is the leading candidate and they prefer no alternative to it.  Voters from Chattanooga and Knoxville will withdraw their support from Nashville, the leading candidate, because they do not support it over Chattanooga.  The new results would be:
*Memphis: 42
*Nashville: 68
*Chattanooga: 32
*Knoxville: 32

If, however, Memphis were perceived as the strongest challenger, voters from Memphis would withdraw their votes from Nashville, whereas voters from Chattanooga and Knoxville would support Nashville over Memphis.  The results would then be:
*Memphis: 42
*Nashville: 58
*Chattanooga: 32
*Knoxville: 32

The mathematics of approval voting lend it to some manipulation and tactical voting.  As each vote counts as one vote and the winner is the one with the highest total, each vote equally helps the candidate/issue (city in this example) selected win.  Because of this, voters are more likely to only vote for their favorite.  Because Approval voting has not been used much for real elections, this phenomenon is not well documented.

==Effect on elections==
The effect of this system as an [[electoral reform]] measure is not without critics.  [[Instant-runoff voting]] advocates like the [[Center for Voting and Democracy]] argue that Approval Voting would lead to the election of &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; candidates disliked by few, and liked by few, but this could also be seen as an inherent strength against demagoguery in favor of a discreet popularity.  A study by Approval advocates [[Steven Brams]] and [[Dudley R. Herschbach]] published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 2001&lt;ref&gt;Brams and Herschbach {{Journal reference|Title=The Science of Elections|ID={{DOI|10.1126/science.292.5521.1449}}|Journal=Science|Volume=292|Issue=5521|Pages=1449|Year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that approval voting was &quot;fairer&quot; than [[Preferential voting|preference voting]] on a number of criteria.  They claimed that a close analysis shows that the hesitation to support a lesser evil candidate to the same degree as one supports one's first choice actually outweighs the extra votes that such second choices get.

One study showed that approval voting would not have chosen the same two winners
as plurality voting (Chirac and Le Pen) in [[French_presidential_election%2C_2002|France's presidential election of 2002]] (first round) - it instead would have
chosen Chirac and Jospin.  This seems a more reasonable result since Le Pen was a radical who
lost to Chirac by an enormous margin in the second round.{{fact}}

==Other issues and comparisons==
Advocates of approval voting often note that a single simple ballot can serve for single, multiple, or negative choices.  It requires the voter to think carefully about who or what they really accept, rather than trusting a system of tallying or compromising by formal ranking or counting. Compromises happen but they are explicit, and chosen by the voter, not by the ballot counting.
Some features of approval voting include:
*Unlike [[Condorcet method]], [[instant-runoff voting]], and other methods that require ranking candidates, approval voting does not require significant changes in ballot design, voting procedures or equipment, and it is easier for voters to use and understand.  This reduces problems with mismarked ballots, disputed results and recounts.
*It provides less incentive for [[negative campaigning]] than many other systems, though the same incentive as [[instant runoff voting]], [[condorcet method]], and [[Borda count]].
*It allows voters to express [[tolerances versus preferences|tolerances but not preferences]]. Some political scientists consider this a major advantage, especially where acceptable choices are more important than popular choices. 
*Each voter may vote as many times as they wish, at most once per candidate.   This is equivalent to saying that each voter may ''approve'' or ''disapprove'' each candidate by voting or not voting for them, and it's also equivalent to voting +1 or 0 in a [[range voting]] system.
*It is easily reversed as [[disapproval voting]] where a choice is disavowed, as is already required in other measures in politics (e.g. representative [[recall election|recall]]).
*In contentious elections with a super-majority of voters who prefer their favorite candidate vastly over all others, approval voting tends to revert to [[plurality voting]].  Some voters will support only their single favored candidate when they perceive the other candidates to be poor compromises.
*Approval voting fails the [[majority criterion]], so that the favorite candidate of a majority can fail to be elected.

However strategy issues of candidate list order if voters are not fully aware and reflective of the full set of candidates before any votes are cast.)

===Multiple winners===
Approval voting can be extended to multiple winner elections, either as ''block approval voting'', a simple variant on [[block voting]] where each voter can select an unlimited number of candidates and the candidates with the most approval votes win, or as ''[[proportional approval voting]]'' which seeks to maximise the overall satisfaction with the final result using approval voting.  That first system has been called minisum to distinguish it from minimax, a system which uses approval ballots and aims to elect the slate of candidates that differs from the least-satisfied voter's ballot as little as possible.

===Relation to effectiveness of choices===
[[Operations research]] has shown that the effectiveness of a policy and thereby a leader who sets several policies will be [[Logistic function|sigmoidally]] related to the level of approval associated with that policy or leader.  There is an acceptance level below which effectiveness is very low and above which it is very high.  More than one candidate may be in the effective region, or all candidates may be in the ineffective region.  Approval voting attempts to ensure that the most-approved candidate is selected, maximizing the chance that the resulting policies will be effective.

==Ballot types==
Approval ballots can be of at least four semi-distinct forms. The simplest form is a blank ballot where the names of supported candidates is written in by hand. A more structured ballot will list all the candidates and allow a mark or word to be made by each supported candidate. A more explicit structured ballot can list the candidates and give two choices by each. (Candidate list ballots can include spaces for write-in candidates as well.)
{| BORDER
|-
| [[Image:Approvalballotname.png|160px]]
| [[Image:Approvalballotword.png|160px]]
| [[Image:Approvalballotmark.png|160px]]
| [[Image:Approvalballotchoice.png|160px]]
|}

All four ballots are interchangeable. The more structured ballots may aid voters in offering clear votes so they explicitly know all their choices. The Yes/No format can help to detect an &quot;undervote&quot; when a candidate is left unmarked, and allow the voter a second chance to confirm the ballot markings are correct.

'''Arizona State University''' (ASU) is currently (as of Fall 2005) the [[List of largest US universities by enrollment|largest university]], in terms of student enrollment, in the [[United States]], with a main-campus student body of 51,612. Founded in 1885 as a territorial [[normal school]], the institution went through several changes of name and purpose before becoming a state [[university]] in 1958.

ASU's main campus, now called the Tempe campus, is located in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Arizona]].  Satellite campuses were created in 1984 in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] ([[ASU West]]) and in 1996 in [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]] ([[ASU Polytechnic]], formerly called ASU East).  Combined, [[ASU West]] and [[ASU Polytechnic]] enroll around 12,500 students.  An additonal satellite campus, [[ASU Downtown Phoenix]], is under development in downtown [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].

Each year, nearly 10,000 students graduate from the university's three campuses. In 2005, 155 National Merit Scholars chose to attend ASU. Many are part of the Barrett Honors College, which has produced 54 [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] scholars, 28 [[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater]] scholars, and 13 [[Harry Truman|Truman]] scholars. Under the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]] ASU is classified as a Doctoral/Research University&amp;#8211;Extensive.

Under the leadership of its 16th president, [[Michael Crow]], several initiatives are being pursued toward this end, the most notable of which is the [[Arizona Biodesign Institute]].  Additionally, a gift of $100 million was given to the College of Engineering, now the [[Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering]], and a $50 million dollar gift to the College of Business, now the [[W.P. Carey School of Business]].

The university was selected to host the third United States Presidential debate on October 13, 2004 at Gammage Auditorium.  [[Edward Prescott]] of the [[W.P. Carey School of Business]] was awarded the 2004 [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] (also known as The Nobel Prize in Economics), a first for an ASU faculty member. At the end of the 2004, [[George Poste]], director of the Arizona Biodesign Institute, was named Scientist of the Year by ''R&amp;D Magazine.''

==Academics==

==Extracurriculars==
[[Image:198557795wVVdGH ph.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Arizona State University is adorned with towering Mexican Fan Palms along its main walkway, Palm Walk. (Photo taken from the Bateman Physical Sciences Center, looking toward the Student Health Center)]]Arizona State University has an active [[extracurricular]] involvement program (Sun Devil Involvement Center) with over 450 registered clubs and organizations on campus. Located on the 3rd floor of the [[Memorial Union]], the Sun Devil Involvement Center (SDIC) provides opportunities for student involvement through [[clubs]], [[sororities]], [[fraternities]], [[community service]], [[leadership]], [[student government]], and [[co-curricular]] programming. 

In 2003 the Student Government adopted a new [[Constitution]] under the oversight of several individuals that split it into 3 branches; &quot;[[Undergraduate]]&quot;, &quot;[[Graduate Student|Graduate]]&quot;, and the &quot;Programming and Activities Board&quot;. All three branches are overseen by a [[Supreme Court]]. A [[Senate]] and [[Executive (government)|Executive]] department are set aside for the [[Undergraduate]] branch, and an [[Deliberative assembly|Assembly]] and [[Executive (government)|Executive]] department are set aside for the [[Graduate Student|Graduate]] branch. The [[Senate]] and [[Deliberative assembly|Assembly]] have representatives from all colleges on campus, providing a critical forum for the discussion and resolution of issues that come before the student body.

''ASU Cares'' is the largest community service project sponsored by the university. It is an annual event that allows students to give back some time by helping residents and communities clean up, rebuild, and/or serve eachother. Faculty, staff, alumni, members of the community and their families and guests are also invited to be part of this large ASU effort to help residents of the various communities surrounding the metropolitan area.

The Freshman Year Experience (FYE) and the [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek]] community (Greek Life) at Arizona State University have been important in binding students to the university, and providing social outlets. The Freshman Year Experience at Arizona State University was developed to improve the freshman experience at Arizona State University and increase student retention figures. FYE provides advising, computer labs, free walk-in tutoring, workshops, and classes for students. In 2003, ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' ranked FYE as the 23rd best first year program in the nation. It has also been recognized as one of the best in both public and private universities by the ''Chronicle of [[Higher Education]]''.

In student media, ''The Blaze 1260 AM'' is the student run radio station at Arizona State University, while [[Sun Devil Television|Sun Devil Television (SDTV)]] is the student run television station.

==Athletics==
ASU is a member of the [[Pacific Ten Conference|Pac-10]] athletic 
conference. Athletes, students, and alumni of ASU are known as &quot;Sun Devils,&quot; a nickname adopted in 1946; earlier nicknames were the Normals or the Owls and, later, the Bulldogs. The nickname was said to have come from an article in the newspaper in which the writer said the quote &quot;Lets call them Sun Devils,&quot; and the name eventually caught on the with the university. The Sun Devil mascot, Sparky, was designed by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] illustrator [[Bert Anthony]].  The ASU fight song is [[Maroon and Gold]], named for the school's colors.  ASU's chief rival is the [[University of Arizona]].

ASU's football venue is named [[Sun Devil Stadium]].  Notable athletic alumni include baseball players [[Barry Bonds]], [[Paul Lo Duca]], [[Fernando Viña]] and [[Reggie Jackson]], football players [[Jake Plummer]], [[Todd Heap]], [[Danny White]], [[Terrell Suggs]], [[David Fulcher]], [[Darren Woodson]], and [[Pat Tillman]], basketball players [[Byron Scott]], [[Ike Diogu]] and [[Eddie House]], golfer [[Phil Mickelson]], and announcer [[Al Michaels]].

ASU is arguably one of the most successful baseball programs in the country.  They have won five national championships, the third most by any school, and have the third most alumni to ever play in [[Major League Baseball]].

ASU won national championships in men's archery 15 times, women's archery 21 times, mixed archery 20 times, men's badminton 13 times, women's badminton 17 times, mixed badminton 10 times, baseball 5 times, women's tennis 3 times, men's gymnastics once, men's track and field once, wrestling once, men's golf twice, women's golf 13 times, women's softball twice, and women's swimming and diving 7 times, for a total of 129 national championships.  Additionally, the men's basketball team has participated in 12 [[NCAA]] tournaments and the football team won the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] in 1986 as well as the [[Fiesta Bowl]] in 1982, [[1975]], [[1973]], [[1972]], and 1971.

===Football===
The Sun Devils played in the [[Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association|Border Conference]] between 1931 and 1961, before joining the [[Western Athletic Conference]] the following year. Led by legendary head coach [[Frank Kush]], the Sun Devils posted a remarkable 62-9 record between 1970 and 1975, culminating in a 17-14 upset of the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln|Nebraska Cornhuskers]] in the 1975 Fiesta Bowl.

In 1978, both ASU and the [[University of Arizona]] joined the Pacific Ten Conference, and in that year ASU celebrated with an emotional 20-7 victory over number-one-ranked [[University of Southern California]]. The Sun Devils then began a slow decline, interrupted only briefly by victories in the 1983 Fiesta Bowl and 1987 Rose Bowl. After a 1987 [[Freedom Bowl]] victory over [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force]], the Sun Devils went a combined 43-44-1 between 1988 and 1995.

In 1996, the Sun Devils went a surprising 11-1, highlighted by a 19-0 shutout of the number-one-ranked [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln|Nebraska Cornhuskers]] in Tempe. ASU quarterback [[Jake Plummer]] led the Sun Devils, propelling Arizona State into the Rose Bowl against the [[Ohio State Buckeyes]]. In a game with [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|National Championship]] potential, the Sun Devils held a slim 17-14 lead with 1:47 left in the fourth quarter, but surrendered a late touchdown to Ohio State, falling by a final score of 20-17. 

Between 1997 and 2000, the Sun Devils underachieved greatly, leading to the dismissal of popular head [[American football|football]] coach [[Bruce Snyder]]. The hiring of head coach [[Dirk Koetter]] from [[Boise State University]] gave the Sun Devils a charismatic leader with a penchant for molding strong quarterbacks.

Arizona State began the Dirk Koetter era with a thud, falling to 4-7 in 2001. However, ASU improved to 8-6 in 2002, highlighted by the play of defensive end [[Terrell Suggs]] and wide receiver [[Shaun McDonald]]. Quarterback [[Andrew Walter]] emerged to pass for a staggering 3,877 yards and 28 touchdowns. The Sun Devils eventually lost a nailbiter to [[Kansas State University]] in the 2003 [[Holiday Bowl]].

In 2004, the Sun Devils surprised nearly everyone, jumping out to a 5-0 record (including an impressive 44-7 victory over Iowa in Tempe). [[Andrew Walter]] led the suddenly resurgent Sun Devils, passing for 1,249 yards and 15 TDs through five games. This set up an attractive matchup between ASU and [[University of Southern California|Southern California]] in [[Los Angeles]] on October 16, 2004, which they lost.  After a dramatic come from behind victory over Stanford University and a win over Washington State in a game in which ASU retired Pat Tillman's number, they ended up losing to rival University of Arizona.  ASU won the Vitalis [[Sun Bowl]] over Purdue, 27-23, on New Year's Eve.

2005 brought a 6-5 record. The Sun Devils narrowly lost to [[Louisiana State University]] in that school's first game after [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Another narrow loss to USC was emotional, considering the Sun Devils led at the half. However, the school was still looking forward to a BCS bowl until [[Stanford University]] upset the Devils, which cost the school its national ranking. The wins over Washington State and Washington were unable to get back the ranking. In a thrilling 23-20 victory over archrival Arizona, the Sun Devils clinched a berth in, and eventually won, the [[Insight Bowl]] against [[Rutgers]].

===Softball===
One of the nation's founding programs, the Sun Devils are in their 39th season on the diamond in Tempe. ASU holds a 1,039-561-1 (.649) all-time record since the 1967 team posted a 5-1 record. ASU has recorded 23 season of at least 30 wins and six with 40 or more victories, including an all-time high of 46 in 2002. The Sun Devils have earned 16 postseason bids, fourth all-time in the Pac-10 Conference, and has made four trips to the [[College World Series]]. Prior to the current NCAA format, ASU went to seven WCWS, claiming back-to-back national tiles in 1972 and 1973.

Arizona State's storied tradition of softball excellence continues to flourish under the tutelage of 16th-year head coach [[Linda Wells]], one of the most prominent and successful coaches in NCAA history. Wells, who is currently the 7th-most successful active coach in NCAA Division I history with 907 victories (9th all-time), has led the Sun Devils to 11 (seven consecutive 1997-03) NCAA Regional appearances in 15 seasons, including two trips in the past six years to the College World Series (1999/2002). While at ASU, Wells has compiled a record of 554-394 and has had seven players earn a total of 12 All-American awards. Her 554 wins are the most victories all-time in ASU's storied 39-year history, surpassing coaching legend Mary Littlewood's 536. Wells earned the victory with a 3-2 win over Sacramento State (2/13/05). Wells' vast coaching experience and tireless work ethic has not gone unnoticed by the country or by the world as she was named the head coach of the Greek Olympic National Team that competed in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. Wells has coached 35 career .300 hitters at ASU in her 15 seasons, averaging a combined .335 -- not an easy accomplishment in the pitching-rich Pac-10 where games are traditionally low scoring, and with the addition of three more All-Pac-10 selections in 2004, Wells has now coached 75 all-conference players during her tenure at Arizona State, averaging five All-Pac-10 selections every season.

'''Astoria''' is the [[county seat]] of [[Clatsop County, Oregon]]{{GR|6}}, situated near the mouth of the [[Columbia River]]. It was named after the [[United States|American]] investor [[John Jacob Astor]]. As of the [[2000]] census, the city had a total population of 9,813.

== History ==
The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] spent the winter of 1805-1806 at [[Fort Clatsop]], a small log structure south and west of modern day Astoria. The expedition had hoped a ship would come by to take them back east, but instead endured a tortuous winter of rain and cold, then returned east the way they came. Today the fort has been recreated and is now a [[national monument]].

Several years later, in 1811, Astor's [[Pacific Fur Company]] founded [[Fort Astoria]] as its primary fur-trading post in the Northwest, and in fact the first permanent U.S. settlement on the Pacific coast.  It was an extremely important post for American exploration of the continent and was influential in helping establish American claims to the land.  The fort and fur trade was sold to the British in [[1813]], and while the fort was restored to the U.S. in [[1818]], control of the fur trade would remain under the British until American pioneers following the [[Oregon Trail]] began filtering into the port town in the mid-1840's. The first U.S. Post Office west of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was also established in Astoria in [[1847]].

As the [[Oregon Territory]] grew and became increasingly more settled, Astoria likewise grew as an ocean/river [[port|port city]]. In 1876 the community was legally incorporated.  It attracted a host of [[Scandinavian]] settlers, and the area still boasts a high concentration of descendants of these original settlers.

In [[1883]], and again in [[1922]], downtown Astoria was devastated by fire, but the city economy was strong enough in both cases to rebuild and thrive. Astoria has served as a port of entry for over a century and remains the trading center for the lower Columbia basin.

In addition to Fort Clatsop, another popular point of interest includes the [[Astoria Column]], a tower 38 m high built atop the hill above the town, with an inner circular staircase allowing visitors to climb to see a breathtaking view of the town, the surrounding lands, and the mighty Columbia flowing into the Pacific.  The column was built in 1926 to commemorate the region's early history by the Astor family.

Eclipsed by [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and other ports further inland along the Columbia, Astoria's economy centered around fishing, fish processing, and lumber. In 1945, about 30 canneries could be found along the Columbia; however, in 1974 [[Bumblebee Seafood]] moved its headquarters out of Astoria, and gradually reduced its presence until 1980 when the company closed its last cannery. The [[timber industry]] likewise declined, with Astoria Plywood Mill, the city's largest employer, closing in 1989, and the [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]] announcing in 1996 that they were discontinuing service.

Today, tourism, Astoria's growing art scene, and light manufacturing are the main economic activities of the city. It is a port of call for [[cruise ship]]s, with many docking in 2004, 2005, and 13 scheduled in 2006.

Astoria was the setting of the [[1985]] hit movie ''[[The Goonies]]'', which was filmed on location. Other movies filmed in Astoria include ''[[Short Circuit]]'', ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', ''[[Free Willy Two]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] III'', ''[[Benji]]'' and ''[[The Ring Two]]''.

Astoria is also the western terminus of the [[TransAmerica Trail]], a [[bicycle touring]] route created by the [[American Cycling Association]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Alarums and Excursions''''' ('''''A&amp;E'''''), started in 1975 by Lee Gold, was one of the first [[fanzine]]s to focus on [[role-playing game]]s.

{{French literature (small)}}

'''Alfred Jarry''' ([[September 8]], [[1873]] &amp;ndash; [[November 1]], [[1907]]) was a [[France|French]] [[writer]] born in [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]], [[Mayenne]], [[France]], not far from the border of [[Brittany]]; he was of [[Brittany|Breton]] descent on his mother's side.

Best known for his [[play]] ''[[Ubu Roi]]'' ([[1896]]), which is often cited as a forerunner to the [[theatre of the absurd]], Jarry  wrote in a variety of genres and styles. He wrote plays, novels, poetry, essays and speculative journalism. His texts present some pioneering work in the field of absurdist literature. Sometimes grotesque or misunderstood (i.e. the opening line in his play ''Ubu Roi'', &quot;Merdre!&quot;, has been translated into English as &quot;Shittr!&quot;, &quot;Shikt!&quot;, and &quot;Shitsky!&quot;), he invented a science called ''[['pataphysics]]''. 

==Biography and works==
A precociously brilliant student, Jarry enthralled his classmates with a gift for pranks and troublemaking.

At the lycée in [[Rennes]] when he was 15, he led of a group of boys who devoted much time and energy to poking fun at their well-meaning, obese and incompetent physics teacher, a man named Hébert. Jarry and classmate Charles Morin wrote a play they called ''Les Polonais'' and performed it with [[marionettes]] in the home of one of their friends. The main character, ''Père Heb'', was a blunderer with a huge belly; three teeth (one of stone, one of iron, and one of wood); a single, retractable ear; and a misshapen body. In Jarry's later work ''[[Ubu Roi]]'', Père Heb would develop into Ubu, one of the most monstrous and astonishing characters in French literature.

At 17, Jarry passed his [[baccalauréat]] and moved to [[Paris]] to prepare for admission to the École Normale Supérieure. Though he was not admitted, he soon gained attention for his original poems and prose-poems. A collection of his work, ''Les minutes de sable mémorial'', was published in 1893.

That same year, both his parents died, leaving him a small inheritance which he quickly spent.

Jarry had meantime discovered the pleasures of alcohol, which he called &quot;my sacred herb&quot; or, when referring to [[absinthe]], the &quot;green goddess&quot;. A story is told that he once painted his face green and rode through town on his bicycle in its honour (and possibly under its influence).

Drafted into the army in 1894, his gift for turning notions upside down defeated attempts to instill military discipline. The sight of the small man in a uniform much too large for his less than 5-foot frame&amp;mdash;the army did not issue uniforms small enough&amp;mdash;was so disruptively funny that he was excused from parades and marching drills. Eventually the army discharged him for medical reasons. His military experience eventually inspired the novel, ''Days and Nights''.

Jarry returned to Paris and applied himself to drinking, writing, and the company of friends who appreciated his witty, sweet-tempered, and unpredictable conversation. This period is marked by his intense involvement with [[Remy de Gourmont]] in the publication of  ''L'Ymagier'', a luxuriously produced &quot;art&quot; magazine devoted to the symbolic analysis of medieval and popular prints. [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] as an art movement was in full swing at this time and ''L'Ymagier'' provided a nexus for many of its key contributors. Jarry's  play ''Caesar Antichrist'' (1895) drew on this movement for material. This is a work that bridges the gap between serious symbolic meaning and the type of critical absurdity with which Jarry would soon become associated. Using the biblical [[Book of Revelations]] as a point of departure, ''Caesar Antichrist'' presents a parallel world of extreme formal symbolism in which [[Christ]] is resurrected not as an agent of [[spirituality]] but as agent of the [[Roman Empire]] that seeks to dominate spirituality. It is a unique [[narrative]] that effectively links the domination of the [[soul]] to contemporaneous advances in the field of [[Egyptology]] such as the 1894 excavation the [[Narmer Palette]], an ancient artifact used for situating the [[rebus]] within [[hermeneutics]].

The spring of 1896 saw the publication, in Paul Fort's review ''Le Livre d'art'', of Jarry's 5-act play ''[[Ubu Roi]]''&amp;mdash;the rewritten and expanded ''Les Polonais'' of his school days. ''Ubu Roi'''s savage humor and monstrous absurdity, unlike anything thus far performed in French theater, seemed unlikely to ever actually be performed on stage. However, impetuous theater director [[Aurélien-Marie Lugné-Poe]] took the risk, producing the play at his Théâtre de l'Oeuvre.

On opening night ([[December 10]], [[1896]]), with traditionalists and the [[avant-garde]] in the audience, King Ubu (played by [[Firmin Gémier]]) stepped forward and intoned the opening word, &quot;Merdre!&quot; (&quot;Shittr!&quot;). A quarter of an hour of pandemonium ensued: outraged cries, booing, and whistling by the offended parties, countered by cheers and applause by the more forward-thinking contingent. Such interruptions continued through the evening. At the time, only the dress rehearsal and opening night performance were held, and the play was not revived until 1907.

The play brought fame to the 23-year-old Jarry, and he immersed himself in the fiction he had created. Gémier had modeled his portrayal of Ubu on Jarry's own staccato, nasal vocal delivery, which emphasized each syllable (even the silent ones). From then on, Jarry would always speak in this style. He adopted Ubu's ridiculous and pedantic figures of speech; for example, he referred to himself using the [[royal we|royal ''we'']], and called the wind &quot;that which blows&quot; and the bicycle he rode everywhere &quot;that which rolls&quot;.

Jarry moved into a flat which the landlord had made by horizontally dividing one flat into two. He could just manage to stand up in the place, but guests had to bend or crouch. Jarry took to carrying a loaded pistol. In response to a neighbor's complaint that his target shooting endangered her children, he replied, &quot;If that should ever happen, ma-da-me, we should ourselves be happy to get new ones with you&quot; (though he was not at all inclined to engage with females in the manner implied).

Living in worsening poverty, neglecting his health, and drinking excessively, Jarry went on to write what is often cited as the first [[cyborg]] sex novel, ''[[Supermale (novel)|The Supermale]]'', which is partly a satire on the [[Symbolist]] ideal of self-transcendence.

Unpublished until after his death, his fiction ''[[Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, pataphysician]]'' (''Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien'') describes the exploits and teachings of a sort of antiphilosopher who, born at age 63, travels through a hallucinatory Paris in a sieve and subscribes to the tenets of ''[['pataphysics]]''. 'Pataphysics deals with &quot;the laws which govern exceptions and will explain the universe supplementary to this one&quot;. In 'pataphysics, every event in the universe is accepted as an extraordinary event.

Jarry once wrote, expressing some of the bizarre logic of 'pataphysics, &quot;If you let a coin fall and it falls, the next time it is just by an infinite coincidence that it will fall again the same way; hundreds of other coins on other hands will follow this pattern in an infinitely unimaginable fashion&quot;.

In his final years, he was a legendary and heroic figure to some of the young writers and artists in Paris. [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[André Salmon]], and [[Max Jacob]] sought him out in his truncated apartment. After his death, [[Pablo Picasso]], fascinated with Jarry, acquired his pistol and wore it on his nocturnal expeditions in Paris, and later bought many of his manuscripts as well as executing a fine drawing of him.

Jarry lived in his 'pataphysical world until his death in Paris on [[November 1]], [[1907]] of [[tuberculosis]], aggravated by drug and alcohol use. It is recorded that his last request was for a toothpick. He was interred in the [[Cimetière de Bagneux]], near Paris.

      <comment>disambiguation from [[Knights Templar]] to [[Knights Templar (military order)]] - ([[WP:DPL|You can help!]])</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amalric I''' (also '''Amaury''' or '''Aimery''') ([[1136]] &amp;ndash; [[July 11]], [[1174]]) was [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] [[1162]]&amp;ndash;[[1174]], and [[Count of Jaffa and Ascalon]] before his accession. Amalric was the second son of [[Melisende of Jerusalem]] and [[Fulk of Jerusalem]].

==Youth==
After the death of Amalric's father, the throne passed jointly to his mother Melisende and his older brother Baldwin III. Melisende did not step down when Baldwin came of age, and by [[1150]] the two were becoming increasingly hostile towards each other. In [[1152]] Baldwin had himself crowned sole king, and civil war broke out, with Melisende retaining [[Jerusalem]] while Baldwin held territory further north. Amalric, who had been given the County of Jaffa as an [[apanage]] when he reached the age of majority in [[1151]], remained loyal to Melisende in Jerusalem, and when Baldwin invaded the south, Amalric was besieged in the [[Tower of David]] with his mother. Melisende was defeated in this struggle and Baldwin ruled alone thereafter. In [[1153]] Baldwin captured the [[Egypt]]ian fortress of [[Ascalon]], which was then added to Amalric's fief of Jaffa (see [[Battle of Ascalon (1153)|Battle of Ascalon]]).

Amalric married [[Agnes of Courtenay]] in [[1157]]. Agnes, daughter of [[Joscelin II of Edessa]], had lived in Jerusalem since the western regions of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] were lost in 1150. [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|Patriarch Fulcher]] objected to the marriage on grounds of [[consanguinity]], as the two shared a great-great-grandfather, [[Guy I of Montlhéry]], and it seems that they waited until Fulcher's death to marry. Agnes bore Amalric two children, first [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]] and then the future [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] in [[1161]]. Both would come to rule the kingdom in their own right.

==Succession==

Baldwin III died in 1162 and the kingdom passed to Amalric, although there was some opposition among the nobility to Agnes; they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when Baldwin III was still capable of siring an heir, but now the ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]'' refused to endorse Amalric as king unless his marriage to Agnes was annulled. The hostility to Agnes, it must be admitted, may be exaggerated by the chronicler [[William of Tyre]], whom she prevented from becoming [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]] decades later, as well as from William's continuators like [[Ernoul]], who hints at a slight on her moral character: &quot;car telle n'est que roine doie iestre di si haute cite comme de Jherusalem&quot; (&quot;there should not be such a queen for so holy a city as Jerusalem&quot;). Nevertheless, consanguinity was enough for the opposition. Amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife, although Agnes continued to hold the title Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon and received a pension from that fief's income. Agnes soon thereafter married [[Hugh of Ibelin]], to whom she had been engaged before her marriage with Amalric. The church ruled that Amalric and Agnes' children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession. Through her children Agnes would exert much influence in Jerusalem for almost 20 years. 

== Conflicts with the Muslim states ==

As a [[Crusader state]] Jerusalem was constantly in a state of war. Since Baldwin III's blunder by attacking allied [[Damascus]] during the [[Second Crusade]] in [[1147]], the northern frontier was exposed to [[Nur ad-Din]], whose own power continued to grow from his bases in [[Mosul]], [[Aleppo]], and later Damascus when that city fell under his control. Jerusalem lost influence to Byzantium in northern Syria when the Empire imposed its suzerainty over the [[Principality of Antioch]], although Byzantium was increasingly beset by its own conflicts, particularly with the [[Normans]] in [[Sicily]].

The main theatre of conflict of Amalric's reign was [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]], which was suffering from a series of young [[caliph]]s and civil wars. The crusaders had wanted to conquer Egypt since the days of [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], and even [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] had promised to cede Jerusalem to the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] [[Dagobert of Pisa]] if he could capture [[Cairo]]. The capture of Ascalon by Baldwin III made the conquest of Egypt more feasible, and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] began preparing maps of the possible invasion routes. 

===Invasions of Egypt===

Amalric led his first expedition into Egypt in [[1163]], claiming that the Fatimids had not paid the yearly tribute that had begun during the reign of Baldwin III. The vizier, Dirgham, had recently overthrown the vizier Shawar, and marched out to meet Amalric at [[Pelusium]], but was defeated and forced to retreat to [[Bilbeis]]. The Egyptians then opened up the [[Nile]] dams and let the river flood, hoping to prevent Amalric from invading any further. Amalric returned home but Shawar fled to the court of Nur ad-Din, who sent his general [[Shirkuh]] to settle the dispute in [[1164]]. In response Dirgham sought help from Amalric, but Shirkuh and Shawar arrived before Amalric could intervene and Dirgham was killed. Shawar, however, feared that Shirkuh would seize power for himself, and he too looked to Amalric for assistance. Amalric returned to Egypt in 1164 and besieged Shirkuh in Bilbeis until Shirkuh retreated to Damascus. 

Amalric could not follow up on his success in Egypt because Nur ad-Din was active in Syria, having taken [[Bohemund III of Antioch]] and [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] prisoner at the [[Battle of Harim]] during Amalric's absence. Amalric rushed to take up the regency of Antioch and Tripoli and secured Bohemund's ransom in [[1165]] (Raymond remained in prison until [[1173]]). The year [[1166]] was relatively quiet, but Amalric sent envoys to the [[Byzantine Empire]] seeking an alliance and a Byzantine wife, and throughout the year had to deal with raids by Nur ad-Din, who captured [[Banias]]. 

In [[1167]], Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt and Amalric once again followed him, establishing a camp near [[Cairo]]; Shawar again allied with Amalric as well and a treaty was signed with the caliph [[al-Adid]] himself. Shirkuh encamped on the opposite side of the [[Nile]]. After an indecisive battle, Amalric retreated to Cairo and Shirkuh took his troops to capture [[Alexandria]]; Amalric followed and besieged Shirkuh there, aided by a fleet from Jerusalem. Shirkuh negotiated for peace and Alexandria was handed over to Amalric. However Amalric could not remain there forever, and after exacting an enormous tribute, returned to Jerusalem.

===Byzantine alliance===

After his return in 1167 he married [[Maria Comnena]], a great-grandniece of [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]]. The negotiations had taken two years, mostly because Amalric insisted that Manuel return [[Antioch]] to Jerusalem. Once Amalric gave up on this point he was able to marry Maria in [[Tyre]] on [[August 29]], [[1167]]. During this time the queen dowager, Baldwin III's widow [[Theodora Comnena|Theodora]], eloped with her cousin [[Andronicus I Comnenus|Andronicus]] to [[Damascus]], and [[Akko|Acre]] reverted back into the royal domain of Jerusalem. It was also around this time that [[William of Tyre]] was promoted to [[archdeacon]] of Tyre, and was recruited by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom. 

In [[1168]] Amalric and Manuel negotiated an alliance against Egypt, and William of Tyre was among the ambassadors sent to [[Constantinople]] to finalize the treaty. Although Amalric still had a peace treaty with Shawar, Shawar was accused of attempting to ally with Nur ad-Din, and Amalric invaded. The [[Knights Hospitaller]] eagerly supported this invasion and may have even been responsible for convincing the king to do it, while the [[Knights Templar (military order)|Knights Templar]] refused to have any part in it. In October, without waiting for any Byzantine assistance (and in fact without even waiting for the ambassadors to return), Amalric invaded and seized Bilbeis. The inhabitants were either massacred or enslaved. Amalric then marched to Cairo, where Shawar offered Amalric two million pieces of gold. Meanwhile Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt as well, and upon his arrival Amalric retreated. 

===Rise of Saladin===

In January of 1169 Shirkuh had Shawar assassinated. Shirkuh became vizier, although he himself died in March, and was succeeded by his nephew [[Saladin]]. Amalric became alarmed and sought help from the kings and nobles of Europe, but no assistance was forthcoming. Later that year however a Byzantine fleet arrived, and in October Amalric launched yet another invasion and besieged [[Damietta]] by sea and by land. The siege was long and famine broke out in the Christian camp; the Byzantines blamed the crusaders for the failure and vice versa, and a truce was signed with Saladin. Amalric returned home.

Now Jerusalem was surrounded by hostile enemies. In [[1170]] Saladin invaded Jerusalem and took the city of [[Eilat]], severing Jerusalem's connection with the Red Sea. Saladin, who was set up as Vizier of Egypt, was declared Sultan in [[1171]] with the death of the last of the Fatimid dynasty. Saladin's rise to Sultan was an unexpected reprieve for Jerusalem, as Nur ad-Din was now preoccupied with reining in his powerful vassal. Nevertheless, in 1171 Amalric visited Constantinople himself and envoys were sent to the kings of Europe for a second time, but again they were uninterested. Over the next few years the kingdom was threatened by not only Saladin and Nur ad-Din, but also the [[Hashshashin]]; in one episode, the Knights Templar murdered some Hashshashin envoys, leading to further disputes between Amalric and the Templars.

== Death ==

Nur ad-Din died in 1174, upon which Amalric immediately besieged Banias. On the way back after giving up the siege he fell ill from [[dysentery]], which was ameliorated by doctors but turned into a [[fever]] in Jerusalem. William of Tyre explains that &quot;after suffering intolerably from the fever for several days, he ordered physicians of the Greek, Syrian, and other nations noted for skill in diseases to be called and insisted that they give him some purgative remedy.&quot; Neither they nor Latin doctors could help, and he died on July 11, 1174.

Maria Comnena had borne Amalric two daughters: [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]], who would eventually marry four husbands in turn and succeed as queen, was born in [[1172]]; and a stillborn child some time later. On his deathbed Amalric bequeathed [[Nablus]] to Maria and Isabella, both of whom would retire there. The leprous child Baldwin IV succeeded his father and brought his mother Agnes of Courtenay (now married to her fourth husband) back to court. 

==Physical characteristics==

William was a good friend of Amalric and described him in great detail. &quot;He had a slight impediment in his speech, not serious enough to be considered as a defect but sufficient to render him incapable of ready eloquence. He was far better in counsel than in fluent or ornate speech.&quot; Like his brother Baldwin III, he was more of an academic than a warrior, who studied law and languages in his leisure time: &quot;He was well skilled in the customary law by which the kingdom was governed – in fact, he was second to no one in this respect.&quot; He was probably responsible for an assize making all rear-vassals directly subject to the king and eligible to appear at the Haute Cour. Amalric had an enormous curiosity, and William was reportedly astonished to find Amalric questioning, during an illness, the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection]] of the body. He especially enjoyed reading and being read too, spending long hours listening to William read early drafts of his history. He did not enjoy games or spectacles, although he liked to hunt. He was trusting of his officials, perhaps too trusting, and it seems that there were many among the population who despised him, although he refused to take any action against those who insulted him publicly. 

He was tall and fairly handsome; &quot;he had sparkling eyes of medium size; his nose, like that of his brother, was becomingly aquiline; his hair was blond and grew back somewhat from his forehead. A comely and very full beard covered his cheeks and chin. He had a way of laughing immoderately so that his entire body shook.&quot; He did not overeat or drink to excess, but his corpulence grew in his later years, decreasing his interest in military operations; according to William, he &quot;was excessively fat, with breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist.&quot;
Amalric was pious and attended mass every day, although he also &quot;is said to have absconded himself without restraint to the sins of the flesh and to have seduced married women…&quot; Despite his piety he taxed the clergy, which they naturally opposed. 

As William says, &quot;he was a man of wisdom and discretion, fully competent to hold the reins of government in the kingdom.&quot; He is considered the last of the &quot;early&quot; [[kings of Jerusalem]], after whom there was no king able to save Jerusalem from its eventual collapse. Within a few years, Emperor Manuel died as well, and Saladin remained the only strong leader in the east.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amalric II''' ([[1145]] &amp;ndash; [[April 1]], [[1205]]), [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] [[1197]]&amp;ndash;[[1205]], was an older brother of [[Guy of Lusignan]].  

The [[Lusignan]] family was noted for its many Crusaders. Amalric and Guy were sons of [[Hugh VIII of Lusignan]], who had himself campaigned in the Holy Land in the [[1160s]]. After being expelled from [[Poitou]] by their overlord, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion-hearted]], for the murder of [[Patrick of Salisbury]], 1st [[Earl of Salisbury]], Amalric arrived in Palestine c. [[1174]], Guy possibly later. Amalric married Eschiva, daughter of [[Baldwin of Ibelin]]. He then took service with [[Agnes of Courtenay]], wife of [[Reginald of Sidon]] and mother of [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem]]. The pro-Ibelin ''Chronicle of [[Ernoul]]'' later claimed that he was her lover, but it is likely that she and Baldwin IV were attempting to separate him from the political influence of his wife's family. He was appointed [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable of Jerusalem]] in [[1179]]. [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy]] married the king's widowed older sister, [[Sibylla of Jerusalem]] in [[1180]], and so gained a claim to the kingdom of Jerusalem. 

Amalric was among those captured with his brother after the disastrous [[Battle of Hattin]] in [[1187]]. In [[1194]], on the death of Guy, he became [[Kingdom of Cyprus|King of Cyprus]] as Amalric I. By his first wife, Eschiva of Ibelin, he was the father of [[Hugh I of Cyprus]]. After Eschiva's death in [[1197]] he married [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]], the daughter of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] by his second marriage, and became [[kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] in right of his wife in January, [[1198]].  

In 1198 he was able to procure a five years' truce with the [[Muslim]]s, owing to the struggle between [[Saladin]]'s brothers and his sons for the inheritance of his territories. The truce was disturbed by raids on both sides, but in [[1204]] it was renewed for six years.  

Amalric died of dysentery (allegedly brought on by &quot;a surfeit of white mullet&quot;) in 1205, just after his son Amalric and just before his wife.  The kingdom of Cyprus passed to [[Hugh I of Cyprus|Hugh]], his son by Eschiva, while the [[kingdom of Jerusalem]] passed to [[Maria of Montferrat|Maria]], the daughter of Isabella by her previous marriage with [[Conrad of Montferrat]].

==Wives and Children==
His first wife was Eschiva of Ibelin, married in [[1174]]. They had six children:
# Bourgogne (c. [[1178]] &amp;ndash; c. [[1210]]), married [[Raymond VI of Toulouse]] [[1193]], div. [[1194]], married Walter of Montbéliard [[1197]]
# Guy, died young
# John, died young
# [[Hugh I of Cyprus]] (c. [[1194]]&amp;ndash;[[1218]])
# Helvis (c. [[1190]] &amp;ndash; c. [[1217]]), married c. 1205 Eudes of Dampiere, Lord of Chargey-le-Grey, div. [[1210]], married September 1210 [[Raymond-Roupen of Antioch]]
# Alix, died young

His second wife was Isabella of Jerusalem, married January, 1198 in [[Akko|Acre]]. They had three children:
# [[Sibylla of Lusignan]] ([[1198]]-[[1230]]), married King [[Leo II of Armenia]]
# [[Melisende of Lusignan]] ([[1200]] &amp;ndash; aft. [[1249]]), married [[January 1]], [[1218]] [[Bohemund IV of Antioch]]
# Amalric ([[1201]]&amp;ndash;[[February 2]], [[1205]], Acre)

'''Anthemius of Tralles''' (c. [[474]] - c. [[534]]) was professor of [[geometry]] at [[Constantinople]] and [[architect]], with [[Isidore of Miletus]], of [[Hagia Sophia]]. Anthemius came from an educated family; he was one of five brothers--the sons of Stephanus, a physician of Tralles--who were all more or less eminent in their respective departments. Dioscorus followed his father's profession in his native place; Alexander became at Rome one of the most celebrated medical men of his time; Olympius was deeply versed in Roman jurisprudence; and Metrodorus was one of the distinguished grammarians of the great Eastern capital.

He is known both a mathematician and an architect. As an architect he is best known for replacing the old church of [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]] in [[532]]; his daring plans for the church strikingly displayed at once his knowledge and his ignorance.  His skills seem also to have extended to engineering for he is said to have been employed to repair flood defences at [[Daras]].

Anthemius had previously written a book on [[conic section]]s, excellent preparation for designing the elaborate vaulting of Hagia Sophia. He compiled a survey of mirror configurations in his work on remarkable mechanical devices which was known to certain of the Arab mathematicians such as [[Al-Haytham]]. 

There are a number of stories told about Anthemius, which we may not be able to ascertain for an indefinite amount of time. Regardless of the veracity, these might be the only clues available as to the character of Anthemius.

It is related of Anthemius that, having a quarrel with his next-door neighbour Zeno, he annoyed him in two ways. First, he made a number of leathern tubes the ends of which he contrived to fix among the joists and flooring of a fine upper-room in which Zeno entertained his friends, and then subjected it to a miniature earthquake by sending steam through the tubes. Secondly, he simulated thunder and lightning, the latter by flashing in Zeno's eyes an intolerable light from a slightly hollowed mirror.

Certain it is that he wrote a treatise on burning-glasses. A fragment of this was published under the title &amp;Pi;&amp;eta;&amp;rho;&amp;iota; &amp;pi;&amp;alpha;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;delta;&amp;omicron;&amp;xi;&amp;omega;&amp;nu; &amp;mu;&amp;eta;&amp;chi;&amp;alpha;&amp;nu;&amp;eta;&amp;mu;&amp;alpha;&amp;tau;&amp;omega;&amp;nu; by L. Dupuy in 1777, and also appeared in 1786 in the forty-second volume of the ''Hist. de l'Acad. des Inscr''.; A. Westermann gave a revised edition of it in his &amp;Pi;&amp;alpha;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;delta;&amp;omicron;&amp;xi;&amp;omicron;&amp;gamma;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;phi;&amp;omicron;&amp;iota;  (''Scriptores rerum mirabilium Graeci''), 1839. In the course of constructions for surfaces to reflect to one and the same point
# all rays in whatever direction passing through another point,
# a set of parallel rays,
Anthemius assumes a property of an ellipse not found in Apollonius (the equality of the angles subtended at a focus by two tangents drawn from a point), and (having given the focus and a double ordinate) he uses the focus and directrix to obtain any number of points on a parabola--the first instance on record of the practical use of the directrix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Absalon''' (''c''. [[1128]]&amp;ndash;[[March 21]], [[1201]]) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[archbishop]] and statesman. He was the son of Asser Rig of Fjenneslev ([[Zealand]]), at whose castle he and his brother Esbjørn (Esbern) were brought up along with the young prince Valdemar, afterwards King [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]].

The Rigs were as pious and enlightened as they were rich.  They founded the monastery of [[Sorø]] as a civilizing centre, and after giving Absalon the rudiments of a sound education at home, which included not only book-lore but every manly and martial exercise, they sent him to the schools of [[Paris]].  Absalon first appears in [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]'s Chronicle as a fellow-guest at [[Roskilde]], at the banquet given, in [[1157]], by King Sweyn to his rivals Canute and Valdemar.  Both Absalon and Valdemar narrowly escaped assassination at the hands of their treacherous host on this occasion, but at length escaped to [[Jutland]], whither Sweyn followed them, but was defeated and slain at the [[battle of Grathe Heath]].

The same year (1158) which saw Valdemar ascend the Danish throne saw Absalon elected bishop of [[Roskilde]].  Henceforth Absalon was the chief counsellor of Valdemar, and the promoter of that imperial policy which, for three generations, was to give Denmark the dominion of the Baltic.  Briefly, it was Absalon's intention to clear the northern sea of the Wendish pirates, who inhabited that portion of the Baltic [[littoral]] which was later called [[Pomerania]], and ravaged the Danish coasts so unmercifully that at the accession of Valdemar one-third of the realm of Denmark lay wasted and 
depopulated.  The very existence of Denmark demanded the suppression and conversion of these stiff-necked pagan freebooters, and to this double task Absalon devoted the best part of his life.

The first expedition against the [[Wends]], conducted by Absalon in person, set out in [[1160]], but it was not till [[1168]] that the chief Wendish fortress, at Arkona in [[Rügen]], containing the sanctuary of their god [[Svantovit]], was surrendered, the Wends agreeing to accept Danish suzerainty and the Christian religion at the same time. From Arkona Absalon proceeded by sea to Garz, in south Rügen, the political capital of the Wends, and an all but impregnable stronghold.  But the unexpected fall of Arkona had terrified the garrison, which surrendered unconditionally at the first appearance of the Danish ships.  Absalon, with only Sweyn, bishop of [[Aarhus]], and twelve &quot;house carls,&quot; thereupon disembarked, passed between a double row of Wendish warriors, 6000 strong, along the narrow path winding among the morasses, to the gates of the fortress, and, proceeding to the temple of the seven-headed god [[Rugievit]], caused the idol to be hewn down, dragged forth and burnt.  The whole population of Garz was then baptized, and Absalon laid the foundations of twelve churches in the isle of Rügen.  The destruction of 
this chief sally-port of the Wendish pirates enabled Absalon considerably to reduce the Danish fleet.  But he continued to keep a watchful eye over the Baltic, and in [[1170]] destroyed another pirate stronghold, farther eastward, at Dievenow on the isle of [[Wolin]].

Absalon's last military exploit was the annihilation, off Strela ([[Stralsund]]), on Whit-Sunday [[1184]], of a Pomeranian fleet which had attacked Denmark's vassal, [[Jaromir of Rügen]].  He was now but fifty-seven, but his strenuous life had aged him, and he was content to resign 
the command of fleets and armies to younger men, like Duke Valdemar, afterwards King [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]], and to confine himself to the administration of the empire which his genius had created.  

In this sphere Absalon proved himself equally great.  The aim of his policy was to free Denmark from the German yoke.  It was contrary to his advice and warnings that Valdemar I rendered fealty to the emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] at Dole in [[1162]]; and when, on the accession of [[Canute V of Denmark|Canute V]] in [[1182]], an imperial ambassador arrived at [[Roskilde]] to receive the homage of the new king, Absalon resolutely withstood him. &quot;Return to the emperor,&quot; cried he, &quot;and tell him that the king of Denmark will in no wise show him obedience or do him homage.&quot; 

As the archpastor of Denmark Absalon also rendered his country inestimable services, building churches and monasteries, supporting international religious orders like the [[Cistercians]] and [[Augustinians]], founding schools and doing his utmost to promote civilization and enlightenment.  It was he who held the first Danish Synod at [[Lund]] in [[1167]].  In [[1178]] he became archbishop of [[Lund]], but very unwillingly, only the threat of excommunication from the holy see finally inducing him to accept the pallium.  Absalon died in [[1201]] at the family monastery of Sorø, which he himself had richly embellished and endowed. 

Absalon remains one of the most striking and picturesque figures of the [[Middle Ages]], and was equally great as churchman, statesman and warrior.  That he enjoyed warfare there can be no doubt; and his splendid physique and early training had well fitted him for martial exercises.  He was the best rider in the army and the best swimmer in the fleet.  Yet he was not like the ordinary fighting bishops of the Middle Ages, whose sole concession to their sacred calling was to avoid the &quot;shedding of blood&quot; by using a mace in battle instead of a sword.  Absalon never neglected his ecclesiastical duties, and even his wars were of the nature of Crusades.  Moreover, all his martial energy notwithstanding, his personality must have been singularly winning; for it is said of him that he left behind not a single enemy, all his opponents having long since been converted by him into friends. 

See Saxo, ''[[Gesta Danorum]],'' ed.  Holder (Strassburg, 1886), books xvi.; Steenstrup, ''Danmarks Riges Historie.  Oldtiden og den ældre Middelalder,'' pp. 570-735 (Copenhagen, 1897-1905).

''Absalon'' is also a variant form of the (otherwise unrelated) name [[Absalom]].  This variant spelling is best known from the title of the musical work [[Absalon fili mi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Adhemar''' (also known as '''Adémar''', '''Aimar''', or '''Aelarz''') '''de Monteil''' (d. [[August 1]], [[1098]]), one of the principal personages of the [[First Crusade]], was bishop of [[Puy-en-Velay]] from before [[1087]].  

At the [[Council of Clermont]] in [[1095]], Adhemar showed great zeal for the crusade (there is evidence Urban II had conferred with Adhemar before the council) and having been named [[apostolic legate]] and appointed to lead the crusade by [[Pope Urban II]], he accompanied [[Raymond IV of Toulouse|Raymond IV]], [[count of Toulouse]], to the east. Whilst Raymond and the other leaders often conflicted with each other over the leadership of the crusade, Adhemar was always recognised as the spiritual leader of the crusade.

Adhemar negotiated with [[Alexius I Comnenus]] at [[Constantinople]], reestablished at [[Nicaea]] some discipline among the crusaders, fought a crucial role at the battle of Dorylaeum and was largely responsible for sustaining morale during the [[siege of Antioch]] through various religious rites including fasting and special observances of holy days. After the capture of [[Antioch|the city]] in June, [[1098]], and the subsequent siege led by [[Kerbogha]], Adhemar organized a procession through the streets, and had the gates locked so that the Crusaders, many of whom had begun to panic, would be unable to desert the city. He was extremely skeptical of [[Peter Bartholomew]]'s discovery in Antioch of the [[Holy Lance]], especially because he knew such a relic already existed in Constantinople; however, he was willing to let the Crusader army believe it was real if it raised their morale. 

When Kerbogha was defeated, Adhemar organized a council in an attempt to settle the leadership disputes, but he died on August 1, 1098, probably of [[typhus]]. The disputes among the higher nobles went unsolved, and the march to [[Jerusalem]] was delayed for months. However, the lower-class foot soldiers continued to think of Adhemar as a leader; some of them claimed to have been visited by his ghost during the [[siege of Jerusalem (1099)|siege of Jerusalem]], and reported that Adhemar instructed them to hold another procession around the walls. This was done, and Jerusalem was taken by the Crusaders in [[1099]].

'''Alphonse, [[Counts of Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]] and [[Count of Poitiers|of Poitiers]]''' ([[November 11]], [[1220]] &amp;ndash; [[August 21]], [[1271]]).

[[Image:Blason Alphonse Poitiers.png|thumb|100px|left|Coat of arms of Alphonse: Per pale azure semé-de-lis or (France ancient) dimidiating gules semé of castles or (Castile)]]

Alphonse was a son of [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], [[King of France]] and [[Blanche of Castile]]. He was a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]] and an older brother of [[Charles I of Sicily]].

He joined the county of [[Toulouse]] to his ''[[appanage]]'' of [[Poitou]] and [[Rulers of Auvergne|Auvergne]], on the death, in September [[1249]], of [[Raymond VII of Toulouse]], whose daughter [[Joan of Toulouse]] Alphonse had married in [[1237]]. He took part in two crusades with his brother, St Louis, in [[1248]] (the [[Seventh Crusade]]) and in [[1270]] (the [[Eighth Crusade]]).

In [[1252]], on the death of his mother, Blanche of Castile, he was joint regent with [[Charles of Anjou]] until the return of Louis IX.  During that time he took a great part in the negotiations which led to the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]] in [[1259]], under which King [[Henry III of England]] recognized his loss of continental territory to [[France]] (including [[Normandy]], [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]], [[Anjou]], and [[Poitou]]) in exchange for France withdrawing support from English rebels.

His main work was on his own estates. There he repaired the evils of the [[Albigensian Crusade|Albigensian war]] and made a first attempt at administrative centralization, thus preparing the way for union with the crown. The charter known as &quot;Alphonsine,&quot; granted to the town of [[Riom]], became the code of public law for [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]]. Honest and moderate, protecting the middle classes against exactions of the nobles, he exercised a happy influence upon the south, in spite of his naturally despotic character and his continual and pressing need of money.  He is noted for ordering the first recorded local expulsion of [[Jew]]s, when he did so in Poitou in [[1249]].

He died without heirs on his return from the [[Eighth Crusade]], in [[Italy]], probably at [[Savona]], on [[August 21]], 1271. As part of his [[bequest]], he left his lands in the [[Comtat Venaissin]] to the [[Holy See]] and it became a [[Papal States|Papal territory]] in [[1274]], a status that it retained until [[1791]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[fr:Alphonse Jourdain]]
'''Alphonse I''' ([[1103]]&amp;ndash;[[1148]]), [[Counts of Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]], son of Count [[Raymond of Toulouse|Raymond IV]] by his third wife, [[Elvira of Castile]], was born in the castle of [[Mont-Pelerin]], [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], in today's [[Lebanon]]. He was born while his father was on crusade, attempting to create the [[County of Tripoli]] on the Palestinian coast. He was surnamed ''Jourdain'' after being [[baptized]] in the [[Jordan River]].  

His father died when he was two years old and he remained under the guardianship of his cousin, [[Guillaume Jourdain]], count of [[Cerdagne]] (d. [[1109]]), until he was five. He was then taken to [[Europe]] and his brother [[Bertrand of Toulouse|Bertrand]] gave him the countship of [[Rouergue]]. In his tenth year, upon Bertrand's death ([[1112]]), he succeeded to the countship of Toulouse and marquisate of [[Provence]], but Toulouse was taken from him by [[William IX of Aquitaine|William IX]], [[count of Poitiers]], in [[1114]], who claimed it by right of his wife Philippa of Toulouse, daughter of William IV of Toulouse. He recovered a part in [[1119]], but continued to fight for his possessions until about [[1123]]. When at last successful, he was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by [[Pope Callixtus II]] for having expelled the monks of [[Saint-Gilles]], who had aided his enemies.

He next fought for the sovereignty of Provence against [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona|Raymond Berenger III]], and not till September [[1125]] did the war end in an amicable agreement. Under it Jourdain became absolute master of the regions lying between the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Alps]], [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] and the sea. His ascendancy was an unmixed good to the country, for during a period of fourteen years art and industry flourished. About [[1134]] he seized the countship of [[Narbonne]], only restoring it to the Viscountess [[Ermengarde of Narbonne|Ermengarde]] (d. [[1197]]) in [[1143]]. The claim of the now deceased Philippa of Toulouse was pressed again when [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] besieged Toulouse in [[1141]], in right of his wife [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], the grandaughter of Philippa, but without result.

Next year Jourdain again incurred the displeasure of the church by siding with the rebels of [[Montpellier]] against their lord. A second time he was excommunicated; but in [[1146]] he took the cross at the meeting of [[Vezelay]] called by Louis VII, and in [[August]], [[1147]] embarked for the East in the [[Second Crusade]]. He lingered on the way in [[Italy]] and probably in [[Constantinople]]. Alphonse might have met [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]] during his visit there.

But in [[1148]] Alphonse had finally arrived at [[Acre, Palestine|Acre]]. Among his companions he had made enemies and he was destined to take no share in the crusade he had joined.  He was poisoned at [[Caesarea]], either by [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], the wife of Louis, or [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]], the mother of [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]], [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|king of Jerusalem]] suggesting the draught.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ambrose''' (around [[1190]]), [[Normans|Norman]] [[poet]], and chronicler of the [[Third Crusade]], [[author]] of a work called ''L'Estoire de la guerre sainte'', which describes in rhyming [[Old French language|French]] [[verse]] the adventures of [[Richard I of England|Richard Coeur de Lion]] as a [[crusader]].  The poem is known to us only through one [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] [[manuscript]], and long escaped the notice of [[historian]]s.  

The credit for detecting its value belongs to the late [[Gaston Paris]], although his edition ([[1897]]) was partially anticipated by the editors of the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', who published some selections in the twenty-seventh volume of their Scriptores ([[1885]]).  

Ambrose followed Richard I as a [[noncombatant]], and not improbably as a court-[[minstrel]].  He speaks as an eye-witness of the king's doings at [[Messina, Italy|Messina]], in [[Cyprus]],  at the [[siege of Acre]], and in the abortive campaign which followed the capture of that city.  

Ambrose is surprisingly accurate in his [[chronology]]; though he did not complete his work before [[1195]], it is evidently founded upon notes which he had taken in the course of his [[pilgrimage]].  He shows no greater [[politics|political]] insight than we should expect from his position; but relates what he had seen and heard with a naïve vivacity which compels attention. He is prejudiced against the [[Saracens]], against the [[France|French]], and against all the rivals or enemies of his master; but he is never guilty of deliberate misrepresentation.  He is rather to be treated as a [[biographer]] than as a historian of the Crusade in its broader aspects.  None the less he is the chief authority for the events of the years 1190-1192, so far as these are connected with 
the [[Holy Land]].  

The ''Itinerarium Regis Ricardi'' (formerly attributed to [[Geoffrey Vinsauf]], but in reality the work of Richard, a canon of Holy Trinity, London) is little more than a free paraphrase of Ambrose.  The first book of the Itinerarium contains some additional facts; and the whole of the [[Latin]] version is adorned with dowers of [[rhetoric]] which are foreign to the style of Ambrose. But it is no longer possible to regard the Itinerarium as a first-hand [[narrative]].  [[William Stubbs|Stubbs]]'s edition of the Itinerarium ([[Rolls Series]], 1864), in which the contrary [[hypothesis]] is maintained, appeared before Gaston Paris published his discovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Stamp-ctc-art-deco.jpg|thumb|The Art Deco spire of the [[Chrysler Building]], built 1928-1930, commemorated on a US stamp]]

'''Art Deco''' ([[French (language)|French]]: ''Exposition Internationale des '''Art'''s '''Déco'''ratifs et Industriels Modernes'') was an early twentieth century movement in the [[decorative art]]s, that also grew in influence to affect [[architecture]], [[fashion]] and the [[visual arts]].

==Overview==

Art Deco derived its name from the [[World's fair]] held in [[Paris]] in [[1925]], formally titled the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]], which showcased French luxury goods and reassured the world that Paris remained the international center of style after [[World War I]]. Art Deco did not originate with the Exposition; it was a major style in [[Europe]] from the early [[1920s]], though it did not catch on in the [[United States|U.S.]] until about [[1928]], when it quickly modulated into the [[Streamline Moderne]] during the [[1930s]], the decade with which Americanized Art Deco is most strongly associated today.

Paris remained the center of the high end of Art Deco design, epitomized in furniture by [[Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann]], the best-known of Art Deco furniture designers and perhaps the last of the traditional Parisian ''ébénistes'', and [[Jean-Jacques Rateau]], the firm of [[Süe et Mare]], the screens of [[Eileen Gray]], wrought iron of [[Edgar Brandt]], metalwork and lacquer of Swiss-Jewish [[Jean Dunand]], the glass of [[René Lalique]] and [[Maurice Marinot]], clocks and jewelry by [[Cartier SA|Cartier]].

The term '''Art Deco''' was coined during the Exposition of 1925 but did not receive wider usage until it was re-evaluated in the [[1960s]]. Its practitioners were not working as a coherent community. It is considered to be eclectic, being influenced by a variety of sources, to name a few:

*Early work from the [[Wiener Werkstätte]]; functional industrial design
*&quot;Primitive&quot; arts of Africa, Egypt, or Aztec Mexico 
*Ancient Greek sculpture and pottery design of the less naturalistic &quot;[[Archaic_period_in_Greece|archaic period]]&quot;
*[[Léon Bakst]]'s sets and costumes for [[Diaghilev]]'s ''[[Ballets Russes]]''  
*Fractionated, crystalline, facetted form of decorative [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]]
*[[Fauvism|Fauve]] color palette
*Severe forms of [[Neoclassicism]]: Boullée, Schinkel
*Everything associated with Jazz, [[Jazz Age]] or &quot;jazzy&quot;
*Animal motifs and forms; tropical foliage; [[ziggurat|ziggurats]]; crystals; &quot;sunbursts&quot;; stylized fountain motifs
*Lithe athletic &quot;modern&quot; female forms; flappers' bobbed haircuts
*[[Streamline_Moderne|Machine age]] technology such as the [[radio]] and [[skyscraper]].

[[Image:Asheville_City_Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Asheville, North Carolina]] City Hall, 1926&amp;ndash;1928 epitomizes the American [[Art Deco]] style.]]

Corresponding to these influences, the Art Deco is characterised by use of materials such as [[aluminium]], [[stainless steel]], lacquer, inlaid wood, sharkskin, and zebraskin. The bold use of zigzag and stepped forms, and sweeping curves (unlike the sinuous curves of the [[Art nouveau]]), [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] patterns, and the [[sunburst]] motif. Some of these motifs were ubiquitous — for example the sunburst motif was used in such varied contexts as a lady's shoe, a radiator grille, the auditorium of the [[Radio City Music Hall]] and the spire of the [[Chrysler Building]]. 
Art Deco was an opulent style and this opulence is attributed as a reaction to the forced austerity during the years of World War I. 
Art Deco was a popular style for interiors of cinema theatres and [[ocean liner]]s such as the [[SS Ile de France|''Ile de France'']] and [[SS Normandie|''Normandie'']].

A parallel movement following close behind, the [[Streamline]] or [[Streamline Moderne]], was influenced by manufacturing and streamlining techniques arising from science and the mass production shape of bullet, liners, etc., where aerodynamics are involved. Once the Chrysler Air-Flo design of [[1933]] was successful, &quot;streamlined&quot; forms began to be used even for objects such as pencil sharpeners and refrigerators. 
In architecture, this style was characterised by rounded corners, used predominantly for buildings at road junctions.

Some historians see Art Deco as a type of or early form of [[Modernism]].

Art Deco slowly lost patronage in the West after reaching mass production, where it began to be derided as gaudy and presenting a false image of luxury. Eventually the style was cut short by the austerities of [[World War II]]. In colonial countries such as India, it became a gateway for Modernism and continued to be used well into the 1960s. A resurgence of interest in Art Deco came with graphic design in the 1980s, where its association with [[film noir]] and 1930s glamour led to its use in ads for jewelry and fashion. This is still the image of Art Deco held in the minds of most Americans.

'''ASCII art''', an artistic medium relying primarily on [[computer]]s for presentation, consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable [[character (computing)|characters]] defined by [[ASCII]]. The term is also used more loosely to refer to [[#Other text based art|text based art in general]]. They can be created with any [[text editor]], and are often used with [[free-form language]]s. Most examples of ASCII [[art]] require a [[typeface#Proportion|fixed-width font]] (non-proportional [[typeface|fonts]], like on a traditional [[typewriter]]) such as [[Courier (font)|Courier]] for presentation.

ASCII art is used wherever text can be more readily printed or transmitted than graphics, or in some cases, where the transmission of pictures is not possible. This includes typewriters, [[teletype]]s, non-graphic [[computer terminal]]s, in early [[computer network]]ing (e.g., [[bulletin board system|BBSes]]), [[e-mail]], and [[Usenet]] news messages. ASCII art is also used within the [[source code]] of computer programs for representation of company or product logos, and flow control or other diagrams. In some cases, the entire source code of a program is a piece of ASCII art - for instance, an entry to one of the earlier [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] is a program that adds numbers, but visually looks like a binary adder drawn in logic ports. Taking the medium to extremes, there exists a video driver for the popular video game ''[[Quake]]'' that displays the game in ASCII art. ASCII art is also very commonly used amongst software piracy groups to display group logos inside text (*.nfo) files containing the instructions for installing and cracking the software (though these commonly use PC text mode characters as well as just ASCII).

Pop artist [[Beck]] has a music video &quot;Black Tambourine&quot; made up entirely of ASCII characters that approximate the original footage.

''Animated ASCII art'' is possible by embedding video terminal escape sequences such as ANSI X3.64 for cursor movement into the &quot;picture&quot;.

==Types and examples of ASCII art==
The simplest forms of ASCII art are combinations of two or three characters for expressing emotion in text.  They are commonly referred to as '[[emoticon]]', 'smilie', or 'smiley'.  Mentally rotate these examples 90 degrees clockwise for a more recognizable orientation:
{|-
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;
:-) or :)   :-( or :(   ;-) or ;)   :-P or :p    &gt;:(    :x  
  smile       frown       wink      tongue out   mad   sour
                                   
B-) or 8-)  :-O or :O   :-0 or :0   :-S or :S    :D     :?
sunglasses   shouting   surprised    confused   laugh   eh?
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}
There is another type of one-line ASCII art that does not require the mental rotation of pictures, which is widely known in Japan as [[Emoticon#East Asian style|kaomoji]] (literally &quot;face characters&quot;.) Traditionally, they are referred to as &quot;ASCII face&quot;.  Today, some call them &quot;verticons&quot;:
{|-
|-
|
&lt;pre&gt;
(^_^)       (-_-)       (X_X)
happy        sad        dead

';' for sweatdrop      downcast          ',' for tears

&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

More complex examples use several lines of text to draw large symbols or 
more complex figures. Some common examples:
{|-
|-
|
&lt;pre&gt;
    o      o     o    o     o    &lt;o     &lt;o&gt;    o&gt;    o
   .|.    \|.   \|/   //    X     \      |    &lt;|    &lt;|&gt;   ASCII Macarena
    /\     &gt;\   /&lt;    &gt;\   /&lt;     &gt;\    /&lt;     &gt;\   /&lt;

            (__)                      
            (oo)                      
     /-------\/      __        O          _            ,__o
    / |     ||      /o)\      /|\       &gt;(o)__       _-\_&lt;, 
   *  ||----||      \(o/      / \        (_~_/      (*)/'(*)
      ~~    ~~                          ~~~~~~~
        Bull      Yin/Yang   Person   Rubber Duck    Cyclist

  ,-._,-.      (|)
  \/)&quot;(\/      | |
   (_o_)       | |
               | |
    Dog       () ()   
              
              Tulip

&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

A more intricate example of this depicts a building:
{|-

                                   .-.

It is popular to put such art in [[signature block]]s to be included in e-mail and Usenet postings.

Other ASCII art ignores the particular shape of the characters and instead uses their overall boldness or lightness to create varying gradients.
{|-
|-
| &lt;pre&gt;
       _a,
      _yQa.
     _qTWW(
     je`?QX:
    &lt;d+ -3Wm;
   _qos_s%mWw,
   a2?????TWW(
  sd(     -?Qm;.
.amm;     .xmWmc
&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;`    &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}


&lt;/font&gt;

One use for ASCII art is to create unique typography, for example:
{|-
|-
|
       ___              __,
      ( /              (          o _/_ /
       / __,  _   _     `.  _ _  ,  /  /_
     _/_(_/(_/ /_(/_  (___)/ / /_(_(__/ /_
    //
   (/
|}
The program ''[[Figlet]]'' (and other programs that support its standard) allow for the design and use of ASCII fonts:
{|-
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;
 _____ ___ ____ _      _   
|  ___|_ _/ ___| | ___| |_ 
| |_   | | |  _| |/ _ \ __|
|  _|  | | |_| | |  __/ |_ 
|_|   |___\____|_|\___|\__|
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}
What follows is an example of &quot;[[Amiga]]-style&quot; (also referred to as &quot;oldschool style&quot;) [[computer art scene|scene]] ASCII art. This kind of ASCII art is handmade in a text editor. Popular editors used to make this kind of ASCII art include CygnusEditor aka CED (Amiga) and EditPlus2 (PC).

==Methods for generating ASCII art==
While some prefer to use a simple [[Text editor]] to produce ASCII art, [[ASCII Art#ASCII art editors|specialized programs]] have been developed to allow you to draw text in lines, boxes, and filled areas as you would in a normal paint package.

[[ASCII Art#ASCII art generators|Other programs]] allow you to automatically convert an image to ASCII art, which is a special case of [[vector quantization]]. A method is to sample the image down to [[grayscale]] with less than [[integer (computer science)|8-bit]] precision, and then assign a character for each value.

An example of a converted image, created using [http://ascgen2.sourceforge.net Ascgen dotNet], is given below, next to the original:
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:10 10 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;[[image:Redwingblackbird1.jpg|200px|Photo of redwing blackbird]]&lt;/div&gt;

==Non fixed-width ASCII==
Most ASCII art is created using a [[monospace]] font, where all characters are identical in width ([[Courier (font)|Courier New]] is a popular font). However, most of the most commonly used fonts in word processors, web browsers and other programs are proportional fonts, such as [[Arial]] or [[Times New Roman]], where different widths are used for different characters. ASCII art drawn for a fixed width font will usually appear distorted, or even unrecognisable when displayed in a proportional font.

Some ASCII artists have produced art for display in such fonts. These ASCIIs, rather than using a purely shade-based correspondence, use characters for slopes and borders and use block shading. These ASCIIs generally offer greater precision and attention to detail than fixed-width ASCIIs for a lower character count, although they are not as universally accessible since they are usually relatively font-specific.

==Other text based art==
There are a variety of other types of art using text symbols from character sets other than ASCII and/or some form of color coding. Despite not being pure ASCII, these are still often referred to as &quot;ASCII art&quot;. The character set portion designed specifically for drawing are known as the line drawing characters or pseudo-graphics.

The IBM PC graphics hardware in text mode uses 16 bits per character. It supports a variety of configurations, but in its default mode under DOS they are used to give 256 glyphs from one of the IBM PC code pages ([[Code page 437]] by default), 16 foreground colors, 8 background colors, and a flash option. Such art can be loaded into screen memory directly. ANSI.SYS, if loaded, also allows such art to be placed on screen by outputting escape sequences that indicate movements of the screen cursor and color/flash changes. If this method is used then the art becomes known as [[ANSI art]]. The IBM PC code pages also include characters intended for simple drawing which often made this art appear much cleaner than that made with more traditional character sets. Plain text files are also seen with these characters, though they have become far less common since Windows GUI text editors (using the [[Windows ANSI code page]]) have largely replaced DOS based ones.

===Shift_JIS===
{{main|Shift_JIS art}}
A large character selection, the widespread use of Japanese on the internet, and the availibility of standard fonts with predictable spacing make [[Shift-JIS|Shift_JIS]] a common format for text based art on the internet.

===Unicode===
[[Unicode]] would seem to offer the ultimate flexibility in producing text based art with its huge variety of characters. However, finding a suitable fixed-width font is likely to be difficult if a significant subset of Unicode is desired. Also, the common practice of rendering Unicode with a mixture of variable width fonts is likely to make predictable display hard if more than a tiny subset of Unicode is used.

===Overprinting===
In the 1970s and early 1980s it was popular to produce a kind of ASCII art that relied on overprinting &amp;mdash; the overall darkness of a particular character space dependent on how many characters, as well as the choice of character, printed in a particular place. Thanks to the increased granularity of tone, photographs were often converted to this type of printout. Even manual typewriters or [[daisy wheel printer]]s could be used. The technique has fallen from popularity since all cheap printers can easily print photographs, and a normal text file (or an e-mail message or Usenet posting) cannot represent overprinted text. However, something similar has emerged to replace it: shaded or colored ASCII art, using [[ANSI]] video terminal markup or color codes (such as those found in [[HTML]], [[IRC]], and many internet [[message board]]s) to add a bit more tone variation. In this way, it is possible to create ASCII art where the characters only differ in color.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autoerotic asphyxiation''', or '''AEA''', is the practice of self-[[strangulation]], typically by the use of a [[Ligature (medicine)|ligature]], while [[masturbation|masturbating]] in order to heighten the sexual pleasure as more [[endorphine]]s are produced when the body reaches the near state of [[asphyxia]]. While highly pleasurable, AEA is also an extremely dangerous practice that results in many accidental deaths each year. A small number of people doing AEA use a plastic bag over their head, but most prefer the strangulation method. 

Deaths often occur when the loss of consciousness caused by partial asphyxia leads to loss of control over the means of strangulation, resulting in continued asphyxia and death. Victims are often found to have rigged some sort of &quot;rescue mechanism&quot; which has not worked in the way they anticipated as they lost consciousness. 

It has also been speculated that in some cases autoerotic asphyxiation may have triggered the little-known phenomenon of [[carotid sinus#Carotid sinus reflex death|carotid sinus reflex death]].

It is a popular subject in [[tabloid]]s and celebrity gossip magazines, particularly when a celebrity dies as a result of [[suicide]] or other mysterious circumstances. Such was reputedly the case with the deaths of [[Jerzy Kosiński]] (in 1991) and [[Michael Hutchence]] (in 1997), though no evidence to support the claim was produced in either case.

The artist [[Vaughn Bodé]] died from this cause in 1975.

The death in 1994 of [[Stephen Milligan]], the British Conservative MP for Eastleigh, was a case of auto-erotic asphyxiation combined with [[self-bondage]]. This combination is particularly lethal.

A more recent case is the death in 2004 of [[British National Party|BNP]] and [[British National Front|National Front]] member [[Kristian Etchells]]. [http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/NEWSF04.html][http://www.oldhamadvertiser.co.uk/news/s/177/177605_national_front_member_died_during_sex_act.html]

Recent court cases have come to varied results as to whether the unintentional death resulting from autoerotic asphyxiation falls under the &quot;self-induced injury&quot; clause of standard [[life insurance]] policies, which prevents payouts for suicide.  In June of 2003, one US court said the intent was not death and therefore the case was an accident [http://home.aigonline.com/content/0,1109,15975-1567-legal--legal,00.html], while another in August 2003 said it does technically fall within the terms since death is the logical result of asphyxiation 
[http://home.aigonline.com/content/0,1109,16158-1572-legal,00.html].

== Cultural references ==
Autoerotic asphyxiation is key to the plots of many books, movies, and TV shows.  Included is an accidental death in the film ''[[The Ruling Class]]'' (1972), starring [[Peter O'Toole]], as well as the movies ''[[Ken Park]]'' and ''[[Full Frontal]]'', the [[Thomas Harris]] novel ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'', the [[P. D. James]] novel ''[[An Unsuitable Job for a Woman]]'', the [[Erika Barr]] book ''[[Acquisition of Power]]'' (ISBN 1591293073), a 2002 episode of the HBO television series ''[[Six Feet Under]]'', the US version of [[Queer as Folk (U.S.)|Queer as Folk]], a 2005 episode of the CBS television series ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', and is mentioned and talked about in the 2005 [[George Carlin]] HBO Special ''[[Life is Worth Losing]]''. In the movie &quot;Life As A House&quot; the main character Sam (Hayden Christensen) is depicted indulging in autoerotic asphyxiation in the first few scenes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Poster-red-cross-volunteer-for-victory.jpg|thumb|202px|A WWII-era poster encouraged American women to volunteer for the Red Cross as part of the war effort.]]
The '''American Red Cross''' (chartered as the '''American National Red Cross''') is a humanitarian organization that provides emergency assistance, disaster relief and education inside the [[United States]], as part of the [[International Federation of the Red Cross]].

Today, in addition to domestic [[disaster relief]], the American Red Cross offers compassionate services in five other areas: community services that help the needy; support and comfort for [[military]] members and their families; the collection, processing and distribution of lifesaving [[blood]] and blood products; educational programs that promote health and safety; and international relief and development programs. 

Governed by [[volunteers]] and supported by community [[donations]], the American Red Cross is a nationwide network of nearly 1,000 chapters and Blood Services regions dedicated to saving lives and helping people prevent, prepare for and respond to [[emergencies]]. More than a million Red Cross volunteers and 30,000 employees annually mobilize relief to families affected by more than 67,000 disasters, train almost 12 million people in lifesaving skills and exchange more than a million emergency messages for U.S. military service personnel and their families. The Red Cross is also the largest supplier of blood and blood products to more than 3,000 hospitals across the nation and also assists victims of international disasters and conflicts at locations worldwide. 

The American Red Cross is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Jack McGuire serves as interim president following the resignation of [[Rear Admiral]] Marsha J. Evans ([[United States Navy|USN]], ret.), in December, 2005. [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/13/international/13cnd-cross.html?ex=1292130000&amp;en=b1afad6cb3ef7854&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss]

[[Image:AmRedCross.jpg|thumb|202px|The headquarters of the American Red Cross in [[Washington, D.C.]] was built in 1917 and dedicated &quot;in memory of the heroic women of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]&quot;.]]

== Founders ==  
The American Red Cross was established on [[May 21]], [[1881]] by [[Clara Barton]], who became the first president of the organization.  Barton first organized a meeting on [[May 12]] of that year at the home of [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Omar D. Conger]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]], [[Michigan|MI]]) [http://www.redcross.org/museum/history/charter.asp].  Fifteen were present at this first meeting, including Barton, Conger, and [[United States House of Representatives|Rep.]] [[William Lawrence (Ohio)|William Lawrence]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]], [[Ohio|OH]]) (who became the first vice-president [https://www.trianglearc.org/ARCweb/FD/2001ballreview.htm],[http://www.co.logan.oh.us/museum/Logan_County_History/body_logan_county_history.html]).

[[Jane Delano]] (1862-1919) was the founder of the [[American Red Cross Nursing Service]].

=== Clara Barton ===
[[Clara Barton]] (1821-1912) had already had a career as a teacher and federal bureaucrat when the [[American Civil War]] broke out. (She started teaching around the age of 15 or 16.) After working tirelessly on [[humanitarian]] work during and after the conflict, on advice of her doctors, in 1869, she went to Europe for a restful vacation. There, she saw and became involved in the work of the [[International Red Cross]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and determined to bring the organization home with her to America. 

When Clara Barton began the organizing work in the U.S. in 1873, no one thought the country would ever again faced an experience like the Civil War. However, Barton was not one to lose hope in the face of the bureaucracy, and she finally succeeded during the administration of President [[Chester A. Arthur]] on the basis that the new American Red Cross organization could also be available to respond to other types of crisis. 

As Barton expanded the original concept of the Red Cross to include assisting in any great national disaster, this service brought the United States the &quot;Good Samaritan of Nations&quot; label in the International Red Cross. Barton naturally became President of the American branch of the society, known officially as the American National Red Cross. [[John D. Rockefeller]] gave money to create a national headquarters in [[Washington, DC]], located one block from the [[White House]].

Clara Barton led one of the group's first major relief efforts, a response to the Great Fire of 1881 ([[Thumb Fire]]) in the Thumb region of Michigan, which occurred on Sept 4-6, 1881.  Over 5000 were left homeless.  The next major disaster dealt with was the [[Johnstown Flood]] which occurred on [[May 31]], [[1889]]. Over 2,209 people died and thousands more were injured in or near [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] in one of the worst disasters in United States history. She resigned from the American Red Cross in [[1904]].

===Blood===
The American Red Cross supplies roughly 45% of the [[blood donation|donated blood]] in the United States. Independent community-based blood centers supply 45% and 10% is collected directly by hospitals.  In December of 2004, the American Red Cross completed their largest blood processing facility in the United States in [[Pomona, California]] on the campus grounds of the [[Cal Poly Pomona|California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]]. The Red Cross has had several controversies surrounding their blood program in which the center mishandled donated blood.

===Tissue services===
For more than twenty years, the American Red Cross provided [[allograft]] tissue for [[transplant]] through its Tissue Services Program. It cared for thousands of donor families who gave the gift of [[tissue donation]] and helped more than 1 million transplant recipients in need of this life saving or life-enhancing gift of tissue. At the end of January 2005, the American Red Cross ended its Tissue Services program in order to focus on its primary missions of Disaster Relief and Blood Services.

===Plasma services===
A leader in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] industry, the Red Cross provides more than one quarter of the nation's plasma products. Red Cross Plasma Services seeks to provide the American people with plasma products which are not only reliable and cost-effective, but also as safe as possible.

In February [[1999]], the Red Cross completed its &quot;Transformation,&quot; a $287 million program that: re-engineered Red Cross Blood Services' processing, testing and distribution system; and established a new management structure. 

===Nucleic Acid Testing===
On [[March 1]], [[1999]], the American Red Cross became the first U.S. blood banking organization to implement a [[Nucleic Acid Testing]] (NAT) study. This process is different from traditional testing because it looks for the [[genetics|genetic]] material of [[HIV]] and [[hepatitis C]] (HCV), rather than the body's response to the disease.

The NAT tests for HIV and HCV have been licensed by the [[FDA]]. These tests are able to detect the genetic material of a transfusion-transmitted virus like HIV without waiting for the body to form antibodies, potentially offering an important time advantage over current techniques. 

===Leukoreduction===
A person's own [[leukocytes]] (white blood cells) help fight off foreign substances such as [[bacteria]], [[viruses]] and abnormal cells, to avoid sickness or disease. But when transfused to another person, these same leukocytes do not benefit the recipient. In fact, these foreign leukocytes in transfused [[red blood cells]] and [[platelets]] are often not well tolerated and have been associated with some types of transfusion complications.

The Red Cross is moving toward system-wide universal prestorage leukocyte reduction to improve patient care.

===Research===
The Red Cross operates the [[Jerome H. Holland Laboratory]], based in [[Rockville, Maryland]]. Each year, the Red Cross invests more than $25 million in research activities at the Holland Laboratory and in the field.

===Cellular therapies===
One technique the Red Cross has identified that shows strong potential for treating people in new ways is through [[cellular therapy|cellular therapies]]. This new method of treatment involves collecting and treating blood cells from a patient or other blood donor. The treated cells are then introduced into a patient to help revive normal cell function; replace cells that are lost as a result of disease, accidents or aging; or used to prevent illnesses from appearing.

Cellular therapy may prove to be particularly helpful for patients who are being treated for illnesses such as [[cancer]], where the treated cells may help battle cancerous cells.

==Court ordered consent decree==
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) took court action against the American Red Cross in response to deficiencies in their tracking and procedures for ensuring the safety of the blood supply.  The consent decree outlines some of the violations of federal law that the American Red Cross engaged in before 1993.  Fines were imposed in the millions of dollars.

In response to the decree, Red Cross Biomedical Services now has: a standardized [[computer]] system that efficiently maintains the blood donor database; a network of eight, state-of-the-art National Testing Laboratories (NTLs) that test about 6 million units of blood collected by the Red Cross's 36 blood regions; the Charles Drew Biomedical Institute, which allows for the Red Cross to provide training and other educational resources to Red Cross Blood Services' personnel; a highly qualified Quality Assurance/Regulatory Affairs Department, which helps to ensure compliance with [[FDA]] regulations in every Red Cross Blood Services region; and, 
a centrally managed blood inventory system to ensure the consistent availability of blood and blood components in every Red Cross Blood Services region throughout the country.

In an [http://www.fda.gov/ora/frequent/letters/1000123507_ARC/consent_decree_100023507.pdf agreement with the American Red Cross] the Consent Decree was amended in 2003 with penalties for specific violations.  

The FDA can impose penalties after April 2003 up to the following maximum amounts:
*  $10,000 per event (and $10,000 per day) for any violation of an ARC standard operating procedure (SOP), the law, or consent decree requirement and timeline
* $50,000 for preventable release of each unit of blood for which FDA determines that there is a reasonable probability that the product may cause serious adverse health consequences or death
**$5,000 for the release of each unit that may cause temporary problems, up to a maximum of $500,000 per event
* $50,000 for the improper re-release of each unsuitable blood unit that was returned to ARC inventory
* $10,000 for each donor inappropriately omitted from the [[National Donor Deferral Registry]], a list of all unsuitable donors

== Red Cross Health and Safety services ==
The American Red Cross has become a household name for providing first aid, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), Automated External Defibrillator (AED), water safety and lifeguarding training throughout the United States. The training programs are primarily aimed at laypersons, workplaces, and aquatic facilities. In 2005, the American Red Cross co-lead the 2005 Guidelines for First Aid, which aims to provide up-to-date and peer-reviewed first aid training material. Many American Red Cross chapters also sell first aid kits and other related equipment.

==Disaster services==
Each year, the American Red Cross responds immediately to more than 67,000 [[disasters]], including house or apartment [[fires]] (the majority of disaster responses), [[hurricane]]s, [[flood]]s, [[earthquake]]s, [[tornado]]es, [[hazardous materials]] spills, transportation [[accidents]], [[explosions]], and other natural and man-made disasters.

Although the American Red Cross is not a [[government]] agency, its authority to provide disaster relief was formalized when, in [[1905]], the Red Cross was chartered by [[Congress]] to &quot;carry on a system of national and international relief in time of peace and apply the same in mitigating the sufferings caused by pestilence, famine, fire, floods, and other great national calamities, and to devise and carry on measures for preventing the same.&quot; The Charter is not only a grant of power, but also an imposition of duties and obligations to the nation, to disaster victims, and to the people who support its work with their donations.

Red Cross disaster relief focuses on meeting people's immediate emergency disaster-caused needs. When a disaster threatens or strikes, the Red Cross provides [[shelter]], [[food]], and [[health]] and [[mental health]] services to address basic human needs. In addition to these services, the core of Red Cross disaster relief is the assistance given to individuals and families affected by disaster to enable them to resume their normal daily activities independently.

The Red Cross also feeds emergency workers, handles inquiries from concerned family members outside the disaster area, provides blood and blood products to disaster victims, and helps those affected by disaster to access other available resources.

The American Red Cross also works hard to encourage preparedness by providing important literature on readiness. Many chapters also offer free classes to the general public.

==2005 Hurricanes== 

The 2005 Hurricane Season proved to be the most challenging disaster response the American Red Cross had ever seen in its history. Forcasting a major disaster before the landfall of [[Hurricane Katrina]], the organization enlisted 2,000 volunteers throughout the nation to be on a &quot;stand by&quot; deployment list.

During and after the Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita, the American Red Cross had opened 2,700 different shelters across 27 different states (and registered 3.4 million overnight stays), some of which were evacuation centers for those displaced by the disaster. A total of 225,000 Red Cross workers (95% of which were non-paid volunteers) were utilized to provide sheltering, casework, communication and assessment services throughout thse three hurricanes.  The organization served 34 million meals and 30 million snacks to victims of the disasters and to rescue workers. Red Cross emergency financial assistance was provided to 1.4 million families, which encompassed a total of 4 million people. The Red Cross estimated that it would need USD $2.1 Billion to cover costs associated with the disaster.

No other non-governmental agency has provided such a significant amount assistance to the victims of the Hurricane Season of 2005. 

On February 3rd 2006, 5 months after Katrina's landfall, the American Red Cross announced that it had met its fundraising goals, and would no longer engage in new 2005 Hurricane relief fundraising. The National organization urged the public to help other charities engaged in hurricane relief work, or to donate to their local Red Cross chapters.

==September 11 controversy==

In the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the Red Cross, like many charitable organizations, solicited funds and blood donations for Red Cross activities for the victims of the attacks. Dr. Bernardine Healy, the president of the American Red Cross, appeared on telethons urging individuals to give generously. However, according to America's Blood Centers, the nonprofit consortium that provides the other 50% of the United States blood supply, no national blood drive was needed, since localized blood drives in the affected areas would be sufficient to meet the demand. The American Red Cross felt that the terrorist attacks were a sign of increased instability and urged people to donate blood, even though it wasn't needed at that time. In the end, some blood was destroyed unused.

Also, the American Red Cross created the ''Liberty Fund'' that was ostensibly designed for relief for victims of the terrorist attacks. However, when the fund was closed in October, after reaching the goals of donations, only 30% of the $547 million received was spent. Dr. Healy announced that the majority of the remainder of the money would be used to increase blood supply, improve telecommunications, and prepare for terror attacks in other parts of the country.

Many donors felt that they had donated specifically to the victims of the September 11 attacks and objected to the diversion of funds. Survivors complained of the bureaucratic process involved in requesting funds and the slow delivery of the checks to meet immediate needs. Congressional hearings were called and New York State Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]] investigated the Red Cross. In the end, the American Red Cross appointed former U.S. senator [[George_J._Mitchell|George Mitchell]] to handle distribution of the funds. Dr. Healy was forced to resign for her role in the situation, and the Red Cross pledged that all funds would go to directly benefit the victims of the September 11 attacks.  Healy received a severance payment of $1,569,630 [http://www.give.org/reports/arc.asp].  In the end, out of the $961 million received, 71% went as cash assistance to those directly affected, 15% went for long term mental care and hospital care for the victims and people in the affected region, and 10% went for immediate disaster relief like shelters, food, and health care. The remaining 4% went for administration. [http://www.redcross.org/press/disaster/ds_pr/pdfs/libertyfund013103.pdf]

Significant changes to Red Cross fundraising collection and policy have since been implemented after the Liberty Fund debacle. Numerous watchdog organizations, such as Charity Navigator, have since given high praise to the improved system of honoring donor's intent and minimizing administration costs. During the Hurricane Katrina disaster, the American Red Cross issued a statement saying that 91 cents of every dollar donated specifically for the Hurricane Katrina disaster will go directly to disaster relief. This low overhead is remarkably low for such a large organization.

==International services==
The American Red Cross is involved with many international projects, such as the African Measles Initiative and the relief effort for the 2004 South Asia Tsunami disaster.

The Measles Initiative is a co-ordinated campaign with the US Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and other public health groups, and aims to reduce measles deaths to zero in Africa. The campaign has achieved remarkable successes, in part due to the partnership with local goverments and vaccine producers which allow USD$ 1 to provide one child's measles vaccination. The program has been credited in reducing measles mortality and morbidity in the region, as well as boosting infrastructure for other vaccination and public health programs such as malaria prevention. The program has since been used in areas affected by the 2004 Asian Tsunami disaster. 

The American Red Cross has a depot of pre-positioned emergency relief supplies in Dubai, Saudi Arabia, which was used to respond to the 2004 Asian tsunami disaster, as well as the 2005 Pakistan/South Asia Earthquakes. 

The American Red Cross handles international tracing requests and searches for families who have been separated by war or disaster and are trying to locate relatives worldwide. This is not a genealogical service but one that attempts to establish contact between family members who knew each other at the time of the war related separation. Tracing services also provide the exchange of hand written Red Cross Messages between individuals and their relatives who may be refugees or prisoners of war. At any given time the American Red Cross tracing program is handling the aftermath of 20-30 wars, conflicts, etc. When new information from many former Soviet Union archives became available in 1990s, a special unit was created to handle World War II/Holocaust tracing services [http://english.its-arolsen.org/ (See International Tracing Service)]. The world-wide structure of national Red Cross, Red Crescent societies, the Magen David Adom of Israel and the International Committee of the Red Cross make this service possible.

==Armed Forces Emergency Services==
Although not a government agency, the American Red Cross provides important services to the United States military. The most notable service is emergency family communications, where families can contact the Red Cross to send important family messages (e.g. death in the family, or new birth). In such cases, the Red Cross can also act as a verifying agency of the situation. The American Red Cross works closely with other military societies, such as the Veteran's Administration, to provide other services to soldiers and their families. The American Red Cross is not involved with [[prisoners of war]]; rather, these are monitored by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], an international rather than national body.

A persistent comment by many veterans of World War II is their memory of the American Red Cross selling &quot;comfort items&quot; such as toothpaste and cigarettes to the troops. The American Red Cross acknowledges that they did indeed sell such items, and the unfortunate repercussions have marred the agency's name for many years. In response to such allegations, the American Red Cross responds with these facts, indicating that the organization did not initially want to charge for such products:
 
* At the request of the Secretary of War, the American Red Cross charged a nominal fee for coffee and doughnuts, as well as for lodging, barber and valet services, in stationary military installations overseas. It did not charge in mobile facilities such as Clubmobiles.

* This request was made because other agencies working overseas were compelled to charge for similar items. Giving these items free to U.S. service members would, it was feared, demoralize Allied troops.

* The official War Department recommendation was made in a letter dated May 20, 1942, written by Mr. Stimson, Secretary of War, and addressed to the Chairman of The American National Red Cross.

== Clara Barton National Historic Site ==
In [[1975]], [[Clara Barton National Historic Site]] was established as a unit of the [[National Park Service]] at her Glen Echo, Maryland home near [[Washington, D.C.]] The first National Historic Site dedicated to the accomplishments of a woman, it preserves the early history of the American Red Cross and the last home of its founder. Clara Barton spent the last 15 years of her life in her Glen Echo home, and it served as an early headquarters of the American Red Cross as well.

The National Park Service has restored eleven rooms, including the Red Cross offices, parlors and Miss Barton's bedroom. Visitors to Clara Barton National Historic Site can gain a sense of how Miss Barton lived and worked surrounded by all that went into her life's work. Visitors to the site are led through the three levels on a guided tour emphasizing Miss Barton's use of her unusual home, and come to appreciate the site in the same way visitors did in Clara Barton's lifetime.

      <comment>&quot;far be it from me&quot; not a good example as this used all the time in Britain</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{English dialects}}
'''American English''' ('''AmE''') is the [[dialect]] of the [[English language]] used mostly in the [[United States|United States of America]]. It is estimated that approximately two thirds of [[first language|native speakers]] of English live in the [[United States]].{{ref|Crystal}} American English is also sometimes called '''United States English''' or '''U.S. English'''.

==History==
English was inherited from [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]]. The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America in the 17th century. In that century, there were also speakers in North America of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], myriad [[Native American languages|Native American]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Scots language|Scots]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] languages.

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice}}
In many ways, compared to [[British English]], American English is conservative in its [[phonology]]. The conservatism of American English is largely the result of the fact that it represents a mixture of various dialects from the British Isles. Dialect in North America is most distinctive on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] of the continent; this is largely because these areas were in contact with England, and imitated prestigious varieties of British English at a time when those varieties were undergoing changes. The interior of the country was settled by people who were no longer closely connected to England, as they had no access to the ocean during a time when journeys to Britain were always by sea. As such the inland speech is much more homogeneous than the East Coast speech, and did not imitate the changes in speech from England. 

[[Image:Non rhotic-whites-usa.png|thumb|left|The red areas are those where non-rhotic pronunciations are found among some whites in the [[United States]]. [[African American Vernacular English|AAVE]]-influenced non-rhotic pronunciations may be found among blacks throughout the country. Map based on Labov, Ash, and Boberg (2006: 48).]]
Most North American speech is [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]], as English was in most places in the 17th century. Rhoticity was further supported by [[Hiberno-English]], [[Scottish English]], and [[West Country dialects|West Country]] English. In most varieties of [[North American English]], the sound corresponding to the letter &quot;R&quot; is a [[retroflex]] [[semivowel]] rather than a trill or a tap. The loss of syllable-final ''r'' in North America is confined mostly to the accents of [[Boston accent|eastern New England]], [[New York-New Jersey English|New York City]] and surrounding areas, South [[Philadelphia]], and the coastal portions of the [[Southern American English|South]]. Dropping of syllable-final ''r'' sometimes happens in natively rhotic dialects if ''r'' is located in unaccented syllables or words and the next syllable or word begins in a consonant. In England, lost 'r' was often changed into {{IPA|[ə]}} ([[schwa]]), giving rise to a new class of falling [[diphthong]]s. Furthermore, the 'er' sound of (stressed) ''fur'' or (unstressed) ''butter'', which is represented in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] as stressed {{IPA|[ɝ]}} or unstressed {{IPA|[ɚ]}} is realized in American English as a [[monophthong]]al [[r-colored vowel]]. This does not happen in the non-rhotic varieties of North American speech.

Some other British English changes in which most North American dialects do not participate:

* The shift of {{IPA|[æ]}} to {{IPA|[ɑ]}} (the so-called &quot;[[broad A]]&quot;) before {{IPA|[f], [s], [θ], [ð], [z], [v]}} alone or preceded by {{IPA|[n]}}. This is the difference between the British [[Received Pronunciation]] and American pronunciation of ''bath'' and ''dance''. In the United States, only linguistically conservative eastern-New-England speakers took up this innovation.

* The shift of intervocalic {{IPA|[t]}} to glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, as in {{IPA|/bɒʔəl/}} for ''bottle''. This change is not universal for British English (and in fact is not considered to be part of [[Received Pronunciation]]), but it does not occur in most North American dialects. [[Newfoundland English]] and the dialect of [[New Britain, Connecticut]] are notable exceptions.

On the other hand, North American English has undergone some sound changes not found in Britain, at least not in standard varieties. Many of these are instances of [[phonemic differentiation]] and include

* The [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father-bother merger|merger of {{IPA|[ɑ]}} and {{IPA|[ɒ]}}]], making ''father'' and ''bother'' rhyme. This change is nearly universal in North American English, occurring almost everywhere except for parts of eastern New England, like the [[Boston accent]].

* The replacement of the lot vowel with the strut vowel in ''what'', ''was'', ''of'', ''from'', ''everybody'', ''nobody'', ''somebody'', ''anybody'', ''because'', and in some dialects ''want''.

* The merger of {{IPA|[ɒ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}}. This is the so-called [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Cot-caught merger|cot-caught merger]], where ''cot'' and ''caught'' are [[homophone]]s. This change has occurred in eastern New England, in [[Pittsburgh English|Pittsburgh]] and surrounding areas, and from the [[Great Plains]] westward.

* [[English-language vowel changes before historic r|Vowel merger]] before intervocalic {{IPA|/r/}}.  Which (if any) vowels are affected varies between dialects. 

* The merger of {{IPA|[ʊɹ]}} and {{IPA|[ɝ]}} after [[palatal consonant|palatals]] in some words, so that ''cure'', ''pure'', ''mature'' and ''sure'' rhyme with ''fir'' in some speech registers for some speakers.

* [[English consonant cluster reductions#Yod-dropping|Dropping]] of {{IPA|[j]}} after [[alveolar consonant]]s so that ''new'', ''duke'', ''Tuesday'', ''suit'', ''resume'', ''lute'' are pronounced {{IPA|/nuː/}}, {{IPA|/duːk/}}, {{IPA|/tuːzdeɪ/}}, {{IPA|/suːt/}}, {{IPA|/ɹɪzuːm/}}, {{IPA|/luːt/}}.

* [[Phonological history of English short A#æ-tensing|æ-tensing]] in environments that vary widely from accent to accent. In some accents, particularly those from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] to [[New York City]], {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[eə]}} can even contrast sometimes, as in ''Yes, I '''can''''' {{IPA|[kæn]}} vs. ''tin '''can''''' {{IPA|[keən]}}.

* Laxing of {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} to {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/ʊ/}} before {{IPA|/ɹ/}}, causing pronunciations like {{IPA|[pɛɹ]}}, {{IPA|[pɪɹ]}} and {{IPA|[pjʊɹ]}} for ''pair'', ''peer'' and ''pure''.

* The [[flapping]] of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} to [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} before reduced vowels.  The words ''ladder'' and ''latter'' are mostly or entirely homophonous, possibly distinguished only by the length of preceding vowel.  For some speakers, the merger is incomplete and 't' before a reduced vowel is sometimes not tapped following {{IPA|[eɪ]}} or {{IPA|[ɪ]}} when it represents underlying 't'; thus ''greater'' and ''grader'', and ''unbitten'' and ''unbidden'' are distinguished. Even among those words where {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} are flapped, words that would otherwise be homophonous are, for some speakers, distinguished if the flapping is immediately preceded by the diphthongs {{IPA|/ɑɪ/}} or {{IPA|/ɑʊ/}}; these speakers tend to pronounce ''writer'' with {{IPA|[əɪ]}} and ''rider'' with {{IPA|[ɑɪ]}}.  This is called [[Canadian raising]]; it is general in [[Canadian English]], and occurs in some northerly versions of American English as well (often just applying to the diphthong {{IPA|/ɑɪ/}}, but not to {{IPA|/ɑʊ/}}).

* Both intervocalic {{IPA|/nt/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} may be realized as {{IPA|[n]}} or {{IPA|[ɾ̃]}}, making ''winter'' and ''winner'' homophones. This does not occur when the second syllable is stressed, as in ''entail''.

* The [[Phonological history of the high front vowels#Pin-pen merger|pin-pen merger]], by which {{IPA|[ɛ]}} is raised to {{IPA|[ɪ]}} before [[nasal consonant]]s, making pairs like ''pen''/''pin'' homophonous. This merger originated in [[Southern American English]] but is now widespread in the Midwest and West as well.

Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:

* The [[English-language vowel changes before historic r#Horse-hoarse merger|horse-hoarse merger]] of the vowels {{IPA|[ɔ]}} and {{IPA|[oʊ]}} before 'r', making pairs like ''horse/hoarse'', ''corps/core'', ''for/four'', ''morning/mourning'' etc. [[homophones]].

* The [[English consonant cluster reductions#Wine-whine merger|wine-whine merger]] making pairs like ''wine/whine'', ''wet/whet'', ''Wales/whales'', ''wear/where'' etc. [[homophone]]s, in most cases eliminating {{IPA|/ʍ/}}, the [[voiceless labiovelar fricative]]. Many older varieties of southern and western American English still keep these distinct, but the merger appears to be spreading.

==Differences in British English and American English==
''Main article'': [[American and British English differences]]

American English has both spelling and grammatical differences from [[British English]] (or [[Commonwealth English]]), some of which were made as part of an attempt to rationalize the English spelling used by British English at the time. Unlike many 20th century [[language reform]]s (for example, [[Turkey]]'s alphabet shift, [[Norway]]'s spelling reform) the American [[spelling]] changes were not driven by government, but by textbook writers and dictionary makers.

The first American dictionary was written by [[Noah Webster]] in [[1828]]. At the time the United States was a relatively new country and Webster's particular contribution was to show that the region spoke a different dialect from Britain, and so he wrote a dictionary with many spellings differing from the standard. Many of these changes were initiated unilaterally by Webster.

Webster also argued for many &quot;simplifications&quot; to the idiomatic spelling of the period. Somewhat ironically, many, although not all, of his simplifications fell into common usage alongside the original versions with simple spelling modifications.

Many words are shortened and differ from other versions of English. Spellings such as ''center'' are used instead of ''centre'' in other versions of English. Conversely, American English sometimes favors words that are [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] more complex, whereas British English uses clipped forms, such as AmE ''transportation'' and BrE ''transport'' or where the British form is a [[back-formation]], such as AmE ''burglarize'' and BrE ''burgle'' (from ''burglar'').

==English words that arose in the U.S.==

A number of words that arose in the United States have become common, to varying degrees, in English as it is spoken internationally. Although its origin is disputed, most etymologies of &quot;[[Okay|OK]]&quot; place its widespread usage in America of the early 19th century. Other American introductions include &quot;belittle,&quot; &quot;[[gerrymander]]&quot; (from [[Elbridge Gerry]]), &quot;[[blizzard]]&quot;, &quot;[[teenager]]&quot;, and many more.

==English words obsolete outside the U.S.==

A number of words that originated in the English of the British Isles are still in everyday use in North America, but are no longer used in most varieties of British English.  The most conspicuous of these words are ''[[autumn|fall]]'', the season; ''to quit'', as in &quot;to cease an activity&quot; (as opposed to &quot;to leave a location&quot; as still used in most other Anglophone countries); and ''gotten'' as a [[past participle]] of ''get''.  Americans are more likely than Britons to name a [[stream]] a ''creek'' if its breadth or volume is judged insufficient for it to be a ''[[river]]''.  The word ''[[diaper]]'' goes back at least to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and usage was maintained in the U.S. and Canada, but was replaced in the British Isles with ''nappy''.

Some of these words are still used in various dialects of the British Isles, but not in formal standard British English.  Many of these older words have cognates in [[Lowland Scots]].

The [[subjunctive mood]] (America, America, God '''shed''' His grace on thee, and '''crown''' thy good... ) is livelier in North American English than it is in British English; it appears in some areas as a spoken usage, and is considered obligatory in more formal contexts in American English.  British English has a strong tendency to replace subjunctives with [[auxiliary verb]] constructions.

==Regional differences==

''Main article: [[American English regional differences]]''

Spoken American English is not homogeneous throughout the country, and various regional and ethnic variants exist. These differences affect both pronunciation and the lexicon, and can make one accent a little difficult for speakers of another accent to understand. [[General American]] is the name given to any American accent that is relatively free of noticeable regional influences. It enjoys high prestige among Americans, but is not a [[standard language|standard accent]] in the way that [[Received Pronunciation]] is in [[England]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Al_Spalding_Baseball.jpg|right|thumb|Al Spalding's sporting goods company made a lasting impact on baseball.]]
'''Albert Goodwill Spalding''' ([[Byron, Illinois|Byron]], [[Illinois]] [[September 2]], [[1850]] &amp;ndash; [[September 9]], [[1915]] in [[Point Loma, California|Point Loma]], [[California]]) was a professional [[baseball]] player and famous [[Sports equipment|sporting goods]] manufacturer founder.

Having played baseball throughout his youth, Spalding first played competitively with the [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]] Pioneers, a youth team, whom he joined in [[1865]].  After pitching his team to a 26-2 victory over a local men's amateur team (the Mercantiles), he was approached by another, the Forest Citys, for whom he played for two years.  In the autumn of [[1867]] he accepted a $40 per week contract, nominally as a clerk, but really to play professionally for the Chicago Excelsiors, a not uncommon arrangement contrary to the rules of the time.  Following the formation of the [[National Association of Professional Baseball Players|National Association]], baseball's first professional league, in [[1871]], Spalding joined the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] (a different club to the modern Red Sox) and was highly successful; winning 205 games (and losing only 53) as a pitcher and batting .323 as a hitter.  After the NA folded, he joined the [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago White Stockings]] of the newly formed [[National League]] in 1876, winning 47 games as the club captured the league's inaugural pennant.  Spalding retired from baseball two years later.

{{MLB HoF}}
Retired from the game, he and his brother opened a sporting goods store in Chicago, obtaining the rights to produce the official National League ball.  The business, which grew rapidly over the next 25 years, with 14 stores by 1901, expanded from retail into manufacturing baseball equipment and is still a going concern.  In 1900 Spalding was appointed by [[William McKinley|President McKinley]] as the USA's Commissioner at that year's [[Summer Olympic Games]].  Seven years later, his prompting would lead to the founding of the commission that (erroneously) declared baseball to be the invention of [[Abner Doubleday]].

Receiving the archives of the late [[Henry Chadwick]] in 1908, Spalding combined these records with his own memories (and biases) to write ''[[Americas National Game]]'' (published 1911) which, despite its flaws, was probably the first scholarly account of the [[history of baseball]].

He was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] by the Old Timer's Committee in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1939|1939]].

'''Acquire''' is an abstract [[board game]] of investing in [[hotel]] chains.  It was designed by the renowned game inventor [[Sid Sackson]] in the [[1960s]], and is currently owned by [[Avalon Hill]].  It is well-suited to family play because the rules are simple, no one gets eliminated, and each game takes only about 75 minutes.  On the other hand, it also attracts hard core gamers because there are many opportunities for skilled players to gain an advantage over less-skilled players.  The random drawing of tiles keeps the game fresh for everyone and gives weaker players an opportunity to triumph, but does not prevent stronger players from winning most of the time. 

==Equipment==
* The game board, a rectangular array with room for one tile per location, as in [[Scrabble]].  The twelve columns are labeled 1 to 12, and the nine rows labeled from A to I.  
* 108 wooden tiles ( later versions having plastic ), one for each space of the board.  Each tile has its location such as '''7A''' or '''1H''' printed on one side; that is the only location in which the tile may be played.  Each tile represents a hotel, and adjacent tiles represent hotel chains.
* Six racks in which the players hold the tiles they have drawn.
* Seven markers for hotel chains: two indicating relatively cheap chains, two indicating relatively expensive chains, and three indicating medium cost chains.
* Twenty-five shares of stock for each of the seven hotel chains.
* A supply of play money.

==Rules==
From three to six may play comfortably.  It is possible to play with two, but not very interesting.  Standard tournament games are played with four.

The game starts with six tiles picked randomly and placed in their locations.  This doubles as a convenient way to determine which player goes first: each player draws one of the tiles for the initial setup, and the player with the lowest-numbered tile goes first.

Each player begins the game with $6000 in cash and six tiles picked at random for their starting racks.  On each turn of the game, the player whose turn it is
# must play one tile
# must deal with the merger or founding of a new company if one results
# may buy stock
# must draw one tile

Whenever a player places a tile horizontally or vertically adjacent to a tile which is not already part of a hotel chain, that player has the option of founding a new hotel chain, unless all seven hotel chains are already in play.  The player may choose to found any chain not already in play, and receives one share of stock in the new chain at no charge.

Each player may, after playing a tile on his turn, purchase up to three shares of stock in existing hotel chains.  Only the player whose turn it is may buy stock.

When a new tile is placed adjacent to an existing hotel chain, the chain becomes larger and its stock increases in value and price.  When a new tile is placed adjacent to tiles from two or more different chains, those chains merge into a single hotel chain, with the largest chain taking over.  If there is a tie for the largest chain, the player placing the merging tile chooses which of those will take over.

When a hotel chain is merged out of existence, the players with the most and second-most shares receive cash bonuses.  Then each player decides what to do with their shares in the now-defunct chain.  They may:
# Trade them in for cash at face value
# Trade them in at a ratio of two to one for shares of the chain that took over
# Keep the shares in the hopes that the hotel chain will be founded again later.

Hotel chains with eleven or more tiles are deemed too big to be merged out.  A tile which would connect two chains of eleven or more is unplayable, and may be placed face-down in its location at any time in exchange for a fresh tile.  The game ends when one hotel chain reaches forty-one tiles, or when all chains are too large to merge.  At the end of the game, all hotel chains pay bonuses to the largest shareholders as if they were being merged out, and all shares of stock are cashed in for face value.  The richest player wins.

==Strategy==
[[Cash flow]] is the critical element of [[strategy]].  On one hand there is pressure to buy stock in order to become the largest shareholder and receive a bonus, but on the other hand holding only stock and no cash prevents one from buying into lucrative new chains as they are founded.  The winner is often not the majority stockholder in the hotel chain which acquires all the others, but the player who contrives to have several of his small chains acquired while holding a majority.

The mergers of hotel chains are the critical junctures of the game because those are the only times cash comes to the players.  Stock can't be traded or sold except during a merger.  On the other hand, some games (and some players) will be more cash rich than others, which decreases the importance of holding cash and increases the importance of holding stock.  At such times it may be wiser to hold onto stock or to trade it in two for one.

The cash flow of a game is greatly affected by the number of players involved.  All players can sell during a merger, but only the player whose turn it is can buy stock, so five- or six-player games have relatively many opportunities to sell, whereas three- player games have relatively many opportunities to buy.  Experts consider the four-player game the best for creating critical cash flow decisions.

Whenever cash is plentiful, which tends to happen towards the middle of the game, but will happen at different times for different players, and sooner or later depending on the relative number of mergers, it becomes more important to think about the shareholder bonuses when the game ends.  One must consider that all twenty-five shares in each company will probably be bought before the players run out of cash.

At the crux between the game-end bonuses and the short-term need for cash is the decision whether to increase the size of a chain by playing next to it, or to withhold adjacent tiles.  If your chain doesn't grow, your shares don't increase in value, and you could conceivably be forced to cash out at exactly the price you bought in at.  On the other hand, if you play all the adjacent tiles you have, you will not be able to create mergers when you need them; the timing will be in someone else's hands.

==Variants==
* Some players play with all information (except the tiles held by players) open at all times, while others play that the cash and stock holdings of players are kept secret.  The official rules do not clearly prefer either variant.
* There is also a variant of the game in which play is simultaneous, instead of players taking turns.  For each phase of a turn, the players prepare their moves and then announce them when everyone is ready.  If players try to make moves that conflict with each other (such as two people trying to buy stock in the same chain when only one share is available), they must bid cash to decide the outcome.  This variant tends to be faster-paced and less predictable than the standard rules.
* One variant is to begin play with all tiles, except the ones the players have on hand, placed out on the board in their proper places, but placed upside down. The player then picks freely any one of these tiles at the end of his turn. This decreases the element of luck in game play.
* A nice touch is to grant a player who just created a new chain a one-time opportunity to buy four shares of that chain instead of three (no shares of other chains may be bought). This makes for an extra incentive to start a new chain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{English_dialects}}
'''Australian English''' ('''AuE''') is the form of the [[English language]] used in [[Australia]].  

==Relationship to other varieties of English==
Australian English began to diverge from [[British English]] soon after the foundation of the [[colony]] of [[New South Wales]] (NSW) in [[1788]]. The settlement was intended originally as a [[penal colony]] for British [[convict]]s. They were mostly people from large [[England|English]] cities, such as [[Cockney]]s. In [[1827]], [[Peter Cunningham]], in his book ''Two Years in New South Wales'', reported that native-born white Australians spoke with a distinctive accent and vocabulary, albeit with a strong Cockney influence. (The transportation of convicts to Australian colonies continued until 1868.) A much larger wave of immigration, as a result of the first [[Australian gold rushes]], in the [[1850s]], also had a significant influence on Australian English, including large numbers of people who spoke English as a second language. Since that time, Australian English has borrowed increasingly from external sources.

The so-called &quot;[[Americanisation]]&quot; of Australian English &amp;mdash; signified by the borrowing of words, terms and usages from [[American English]] &amp;mdash; which began during the goldrushes, was accelerated by a massive influx of US military personnel during [[World War II]]. The large-scale importation of [[television]] programs and other [[mass media]] content from the [[United States]], from the 1950s onwards, has also had a significant effect. As a result, for example, Australians use the word ''truck'' instead of the British ''lorry''.

Due to their shared history and geographical proximity, Australian English is most similar to [[New Zealand English]]. However, the difference between the two spoken versions is obvious to people from either country, if not to a casual observer from a third country. The vocabulary used also exhibits some striking differences.

===Spelling===
The exposure to the different spellings of British and American English leads to a certain amount of spelling variation such as ''organise/organize''. British spelling is generally preferred, although some words are usually written in the American form, such as ''program'' and ''jail'' rather than ''programme'' and ''gaol'' (although commonly one could be 'jailed' in a 'gaol'). Publishers, schools, universities and governments typically use the [[Macquarie Dictionary]] as a standard spelling reference. Both -ise and -ize are accepted, as in British English, but '-ise' is the preferred form in Australian English by a ratio of about 3:1 according to the [[Australian Corpus of English]].

There is a widely-held belief in Australia that American spellings are a modern &quot;intrusion&quot;, but the debate in fact goes back to the [[19th century]]. A pamphlet titled ''The So Called &quot;American Spelling.&quot;'', printed in Sydney over 100 years ago, argued that &quot;there is no valid etymological reason for the preservation of the u in such words as honor, labor, etc.&quot; At the time it was noted that &quot;the tendency of people in Australasia is to excise the u, and one of the Sydney morning papers habitually does this, while the other generally follows the older form&quot;. Some Melbourne newspapers once excised the &quot;u&quot;, but do not anymore, and the [[Australian Labor Party|Australian ''Labor'' Party]] officially adopted the '-or' ending in [[1912]].

===Irish influences===
There is some influence from [[Hiberno-English]], but perhaps not as much as might be expected given that many Australians are of [[Ireland|Irish]] descent. Perhaps most noticeable is the widespread – but not universal – pronunciation of the name of the letter &quot;H&quot; as &quot;''haitch''&quot; {{IPA|/hæɪtʃ/}}, rather than the unaspirated &quot;''aitch''&quot; {{IPA|/æɪtʃ/}} found in New Zealand, as well as most of Britain and North America. This is most often found amongst speakers of ''Broad Australian English'' and is thought to be the influence of Irish [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests and nuns. Others include the non-standard plural of &quot;you&quot; as &quot;''youse''&quot; {{IPA|/jʉːz/}}, which is common in some social circles, and the expression &quot;''good on you''&quot; or &quot;''good onya''&quot;, although the former is common throughout North America and the latter is also encountered in New Zealand English and British English.  Another usage indicative of an Irish influence is use of the word 'me' replacing 'my'.  Example: ''Where's me hat?''

===Samples of Australian English===
The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] provides many [http://www.abc.net.au/streaming/ streams of their radio programmes].

Non-Australians can also gain an impression of Australian English from well-known actors and other native speakers. The voices of [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Hugh Jackman]] and [[Naomi Watts]] are examples of [[Australian_English#General_Australian_English|General Australian accents]], unless they are acting in roles as non-Australians. Several [[List of Australians#Film_and_television|Australian actors]] provided voices for ''[[Finding Nemo]]'': Nigel the pelican, the three sharks, and the dentist have Australian accents. Television star [[Steve Irwin|Steve &quot;Crocodile hunter&quot; Irwin]] has a [[Australian_English#Broad_Australian_English|Broad Australian accent]] (see below) and as a result his voice is often parodied inside Australia as well as out. [[John O'Grady]]'s novel ''[[They're a Weird Mob]]'' has many good examples of pseudo-phonetically written Australian speech during the 1950s, such as ''&quot;owyergoinmateorright?&quot;'' (&quot;how're you going mate, alright?&quot;) and [[Tom Keneally]]'s novels, particularly ''The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith'', of putatively 19th century Australianisms such as &quot;yair&quot; for &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;nothink&quot; for &quot;nothing.&quot;

==Vocabulary==
{{main|Australian words}}
===The origins of Australian words===
Australian English incorporates many terms that Australians consider to be unique to their country. One of the best-known of these is ''outback'' which means remote, sparsely-populated areas. The similar ''bush'' can mean either native forests, or country areas in general. Both terms are historically widely used in many English speaking countries, however. Many such words, phrases or usages originated with the British convicts transported to Australia. Many words used frequently by country Australians are, or were, also used in all or part of England, with variations in meaning. For example: a ''creek'' in Australia, as in North America, is any stream or small river, whereas in England it is a small watercourse flowing into the sea; ''paddock'' is the Australian word for a field, while in England it is a small enclosure for livestock and; wooded areas in Australia are known as ''bush'' or ''scrub'', as in North America, while in England, they are commonly used only in proper names (such as [[Shepherd's Bush]] and [[Wormwood Scrubs]]). Cockney and Australian English also both use the word ''mate'' to mean a close friend of the same gender (rather than the conventional meaning of &quot;a [[spouse]]&quot;), although this usage has also become common in some other varieties of English.

The origins of other terms are not as clear, or are disputed. ''Dinkum'' (or &quot;fair dinkum&quot;) means &quot;true&quot;, or when used in speech: &quot;is that true?&quot;, &quot;this is the truth!&quot;, and other meanings, depending on context and inflection. It is often claimed that dinkum dates back to the [[Australian goldrushes]] of the 1850s, and that it is derived from the [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] (or Hokkien) ''ding kam'', meaning &quot;top gold&quot;. However, scholars give greater credence to the notion that it originated with a now-extinct dialect word from the [[East Midlands]] in England, where dinkum (or dincum) meant &quot;hard work&quot; or &quot;fair work&quot;, which was also the original meaning in Australian English.[http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/ozwords/November_98/7._dinkum.htm] The derivation ''dinky-di'' means a native-born Australian.

Similarly, ''g'day'', a stereotypical Australian greeting, is no longer synonymous with &quot;good day&quot; in other varieties of English and is never used as an expression for &quot;farewell&quot;, as &quot;good day&quot; is in other countries.

Some elements of [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]] have been incorporated into Australian English, mainly as names for places, flora and fauna (for example [[dingo]], [[kangaroo]]).  Beyond that, some terms have been adopted into the wider language, except for some localised terms, or slang. Some examples are ''cooee'', ''yarn'' and ''Hard yakka''.  The former is a high-pitched call (pronounced {{IPA|/kʉː.iː/}}) which travels long distances and is used to attract attention. ''Cooee'' has also become a notional distance: ''if he's within cooee, we'll spot him''. ''Yarn'' means to chat or tell a story. This has further evolved into ''spin a yarn'' for telling a long and engaging tale. ''Hard yakka'' means ''hard work'' and is derived from ''yakka'', from the [[Yagara]]/[[Jagara]] language once spoken in the Brisbane region. Also from the Brisbane region comes the word ''bung'' meaning broken. A failed piece of equipment might be described as having ''gone bung''.

Though often thought of as an Aboriginal word, [[didgeridoo]] (a well known wooden musical instrument) is probably an [[onomatopoeia|onomatopaoeic]] word of Western invention.  It has also been suggested that it may have an [[Irish language|Irish]] derivation.[http://www.flinders.edu.au/news/articles/?fj09v13s02]

==Varieties of Australian English==
Most linguists consider that there are three main varieties of Australian English: &quot;'''Broad'''&quot;, &quot;'''General'''&quot; and &quot;'''Cultivated'''&quot;. These three main varieties are actually part of a continuum and are based on variations in accent. They often, but not always, reflect the [[social class]] and/or [[education]]al background of the speaker.

====Broad Australian English====
Broad Australian English is the [[archetype|archetypal]] and most recognisable variety and is familiar to English speakers around the world, because of its use in identifying Australian characters in non-Australian [[film]]s and [[television]] programs. In reality it is less common than General Australian English. Broad Australian English is recognisable by a certain nasal [[drawl]] and the prevalence of long [[diphthong]]s.
Broad Australian English is more likely to be encountered when travelling farther away from the capital cities.

====General Australian English====
General Australian English is the [[stereotype|stereotypical]] variety of Australian English. It is the variety of English used by the majority of Australians and it dominates the accents found in contemporary Australian-made films and television programs, such as ''[[Neighbours]]''. This variety has noticeably shorter vowel sounds than Broad Australian English, among other differences. There is perhaps a trend towards General Australian away from the extremes.

====Cultivated Australian English====
Cultivated Australian English (CAE) has many similarities to [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Received Pronunciation]], and is often mistaken for it. CAE is now spoken by less than 10% of the population. An overwhelmingly large and growing majority of Australians now have either General or Broad accents. One effect of this is that the speech of people like [[Alexander Downer]], the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] is mocked as sounding &quot;[[wiktionary:affected|affected]]&quot;, &quot;[[wiktionary:snobby|snobby]]&quot; or &quot;[[wiktionary:aloof|aloof]]&quot;, when his accent is simply an example of CAE, reinforced by the fact that he completed his secondary schooling at a [[public school]] in England and went to university there. CAE was once common among public figures in Australia.

====Examples of Broad, General and Cultivated Australian accents====
Examples of each include the normal speaking voices of the following identities:

'''Broad'''
*Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]]
*actor [[Bryan Brown]]
*actor [[Paul Hogan (actor)|Paul Hogan]] 
*television personality [[Steve Irwin]]
*television/stage character [[Dame Edna Everage]] &lt;!-- Note: Edna may believe that she has a cultivated or general Australian accent, but listen to her vowels. --&gt;

'''General''' 
*Prime Minister [[John Howard]]
*actress [[Nicole Kidman]]
*actor [[Hugh Jackman]]
*actor [[Russell Crowe]]
*actor [[Jesse Spencer]]

'''Cultivated'''
*actress [[Judy Davis]]
*Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]]
*actor [[Geoffrey Rush]]
*opera singer [[Dame Joan Sutherland]]
*comedian/actor [[Barry Humphries]]

===Regional variation===
It is sometimes claimed that regional variations in pronunciation and accent exist, but if present at all they are very small compared to those of British and American English &amp;ndash; sufficiently so that linguists are divided on the question. Overall, pronunciation is determined less by region than by social and educational influences.

====Regional vocabulary====
There is, however, some variation in Australian English vocabulary between different regions. An example often cited by linguists is the variety of names given by Australians to bland, processed [[pork]] products &amp;ndash; known in other countries as pork [[luncheon meat]] or [[baloney]] &amp;ndash; is so great, that these words are used by linguists to ascertain not only which Australian state or territory a person is from, but also regional origin within states in some cases. For example, in [[South Australia]] (SA) this product is known as ''fritz'', for most people in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (Vic) it is ''stras'', in most of [[New South Wales]] (NSW) it is ''devon'', in [[Western Australia]] (WA) ''polony'', in [[Queensland]] (Qld) ''windsor'' (''&quot;devon&quot;'' is also used), in [[Tasmania]] (Tas) ''belgium'', and so on. (See [[Australian_words#Processed_pork|Australian words for processed pork]], for more details.)

Regional variation does not respect [[States and territories of Australia|state borders]], and this is shown, for example, by the fact that both Queenslanders and people from northern New South Wales say ''port'' (short for [[Portmanteau (travelling case)|portmanteau]]) while people in the other states say ''case'', ''school bag'', ''backpack'' and/or ''knapsack''. In the past variation was so strong that the residents of the NSW town of [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]] would use the word port where [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], some 20 kilometres away, would prefer the latter term. 

There is also great variety in the names of beer glasses from one area to another. For example, a standard 285ml (10 fl.oz.) glass, in different states or regions, is known as a ''middy'' (NSW/WA/[[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]]), ''pot'' (Vic/Qld/Tas), ''handle'' (NT/SA), ''ten'' (SA/Tas)  or ''schooner'' (SA). Such variation causes great confusion, especially since a schooner is a 425 ml
(15 fl.oz.) glass in every state that uses the word except SA. (See [[Australian_words#Beer_glasses|Australian words for beer glasses]] for a full list.)

Although swimwear is known as ''bathers'' in most areas, people in NSW and Queensland do not conform, preferring terms such as ''swimmers'', ''cossie'' or ''togs'' (see [[Australian_words#Swimwear|Australian words for swimwear]]).

Another example is the word ''tuckshop'' which is used in Queensland and northern NSW to describe a food outlet on school premises; the word ''canteen'' is now more common in other areas of Australia, although tuckshop may occasionally be used in those areas as well.

There are many regional variations for describing [[social class]]es or [[subculture]]s.  The best example is probably ''[[bogan]]'' (fairly universal), which is also referred to as ''bevan'' in Queensland&lt;!---removed &quot;, ''westie'' around Sydney,&quot; &quot;westie&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;bogan&quot; ---&gt; and ''booner'' in the ACT.

The differences are not restricted to words. For example, it is often said that people from some parts of [[Queensland]] end sentences with the interrogative &quot;''eh''?&quot; (or &quot;''hay?''&quot;, &quot;''hey''&quot;, and so on), although this is also common in both [[New Zealand English]] and [[Canadian English]]. 

The steadily increasing centralisation of film, TV and radio production, however, may be spreading new words more rapidly and blurring such distinctions.

{{see also|South Australian English|Western Australian English}}

=====Sport variations=====
Many regional variations are as a result of the Australian passion for sport and the differences in non-linguistic traditions from one state to another: the word ''[[football]]'' refers to the most popular code of football in different States or regions, or even ethnic groups within them. [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorians]] start a game of [[Australian rules football]] with a ''ball up'', [[Western Australia]]ns with a ''bounce down''; [[New South Wales|New South Welsh]] people and [[Queensland]]ers start a game of [[Rugby League]] or [[Rugby Union]] with a ''kick off'', as do [[football (soccer)|soccer]] fans across Australia.

In the early 21st century the [[Football Federation Australia| 
national governing body for football (soccer)]] attempted to foster use of &quot;football&quot; to mean soccer, in accordance with general international usage.  It is yet to be seen whether this will spead into the mainstream, however it is important to note that several media outlets have adopted the use of the word football in accordance with this.

The Australian slang word ''footy'' has been traditionally associated with the native code of Australian rules football.  The word has also been adopted to a lesser degree by rugby league followers, following directly from the association of the word to describe the most popular football code.  Examples in popular culture includes the [[The Footy Show]]. More recently it has been adopted in other countries in reference to other codes, such as the UK (soccer) and New Zealand (rugby union).

For many Australian rules followers, the verb ''barrack'' (or the accompanying noun form ''barracker''), is used to describe following a team or club. (In New South Wales and Queensland the term ''support'' or ''supporter'' is generally used instead.) Barrack has its origins in British English, although in the UK it now usually means to jeer or denigrate an opposing team or players. The expression &quot;root (or rooting) for a team&quot;, as used in the United States, is not generally used in Australia as ''root'' (or rooting) is slang for [[sexual intercourse]].

==Phonology==
{{main|Australian English phonology}}
Australian English is a [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] variety. It is unique in its remarkable homogeneity over a vast area. Unlike most varieties of English, it has a [[vowel length|phonemic length distinction]]. It has a reasonably standard consonant inventory.
{{see also|Phonemic differentiation}}

===Myths about Australian accents===
Australian English is sometimes described as high-pitched, nasal, lazy or drawling. The claims of high pitch and nasality are not entirely true, as many Australian English speakers perceive much of American English to be nasal, while laziness and drawling are impossible to test objectively.

Similarly, stereotypes of Australian speech as having a &quot;rising tone&quot; or &quot;questioning intonation&quot;, known in linguistics as [[high rising terminal]], are not entirely justified by the empirical evidence. Many Australians' speech patterns do not conform to this stereotype, and the &quot;questioning intonation&quot; can be found in many regional speech patterns, such as those in the south of England, Northern Ireland, and even North America.

==Use of words by Australians==
Perception has it that a common trait is the frequent use of long-winded [[simile|similes]], such as &quot;slow as a wet week&quot;, &quot;built like a brick shit-house&quot;, &quot;mad as a cut snake&quot;, &quot;up and down like a bride's nightie&quot;, &quot;dry as a dead dingo's donger&quot;, &quot;off like prawns in the sun&quot;, &quot;sweating like a pig on fire&quot;, or &quot;flat out like a lizard drinking&quot;.  Moreover, several such expressions are common in many parts of the English-speaking world and are only perceived as uniquely Australian by Australians.

Many Australians believe themselves to be direct in manner, and this is typified by statements such as &quot;why call a spade a spade, when you can call it a bloody shovel&quot;. Such sentiments can lead to misunderstandings and offence being caused to people from cultures where an emphasis is placed on avoiding conflict, such as people from [[East Asia]]. 

Spoken Australian English is generally more tolerant of offensive and/or abusive language than other variants. A famous exponent was the former [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Keating]], who referred in [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] to various political opponents as a &quot;mangy maggot&quot;, a &quot;stupid foul-mouthed grub&quot;, and so on.  He drew ire from then Malaysian leader [[Mahathir Mohammed]] for calling him a &quot;recalcitrant&quot;. This tradition was continued by fellow [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Member_of_parliament|MP]] [[Mark Latham]] who, in 2002, unapologetically described a visit by Prime Minister [[John Howard]] to [[George W. Bush]] as &quot;an arse-licking effort&quot;.  The widespread  desire among Australians to avoid pomposity, leading to a rejection of even formal or dignified speech, is sometimes seen as reflecting a suspicion of success in general, a phenomenon sometimes known as the [[tall poppy syndrome]], another term widely used in the English speaking world but perceived by many Australians to be a local coinage.

===Humour===
An important aspect of Australian English usage, inherited in small part from Britain and Ireland, is the use of [[deadpan humour]], in which a person will make extravagant, outrageous and/or ridiculous statements in a neutral tone, and without explicitly indicating they are joking. Tourists seen to be gullible and/or lacking a sense of humour may be subjected to tales of kangaroos hopping across the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and similar tall tales. (See also [[Drop Bear]].)

===Diminutives===
Australian English makes far more frequent use of [[diminutive]]s than other varieties of English.  These which can be formed in a number of ways such as adding ''-o'' or ''-ie'' to the ends of abbreviated words. They can be used to indicate familiarity, although in many [[speech community|speech communities]] the diminutive form is more common than the original word or phrase.

Examples with the -o ending include ''abo'' (aborigine, now considered offensive), ''arvo'' (afternoon), ''doco'' (documentary), ''servo'' (service station, known in other countries as a &quot;petrol station&quot; or &quot;gas station&quot;), ''bottle-o'' (bottle-shop or liquor store), ''rego'' (still pronounced with a {{IPA|/&amp;#676;/}}) (annual motor vehicle registration), ''compo'' (compensation), ''leso'' or ''lesbo'' (lesbian, also offensive, pronounced with a {{IPA|/z/}}), ''ambo'' (ambulance officer). [[The Salvation Army]] is often referred to as &quot;The Salvos&quot;. The city of [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] is known by many of its inhabitants as ''Freo''. [[Filipino people|Filipino]] youth in Australia refer to themselves as being a ''Filo'', a word not used by [[Filipino American]]s.

Examples of the -ie ending include ''barbie'' (barbecue), ''bikkie'' (biscuit), ''bikie'' (member of a motorcycle club), ''brekkie'' (breakfast), ''blowie'' (blowfly), ''brickie'' (brick layer), ''mozzie'' (mosquito), and ''pollie'' (politician).  The city of [[Brisbane]] is often called ''Brissie'' (pronounced with a {{IPA|/z/}}).  

Occasionally, a ''-za'' diminutive is used, usually for personal names where the first of multiple syllables ends in an &quot;r&quot;. Karen becomes ''Kazza'' and Jeremy becomes ''Jezza''. Also popular and common is the ''-z'' diminutive form (also found in British English) whereby Karen becomes ''Kaz'' and so on.

Other diminutive forms include:
* last one or two syllables, prefaced with a [[definite article]]: for example, ''The Gabba'' for the [[Brisbane Cricket Ground]] at [[Woolloongabba, Queensland|Woolloongabba]]; ''The Gong'' for [[Wollongong]].
* first syllable plus &quot;-s&quot;: ''turps'' [[turpentine]] (usually referring to drinking alcohol, e.g. &quot;a night on the turps&quot;) or [[Ian Turpie]]; Gabs, pet form of [[List of English given names|Gabrielle]].
* first syllable plus &quot;-ers&quot;: ''Honkers'' ([[Hong Kong]]).

===Rarely Used Phrases===
Because of the caricaturised over-use, or &quot;Hollywoodisation&quot;, of some phrases attributed to Australians, some of these have dropped out of common conversation (at least in most urban areas). Words being used less often are ''strewth'' and ''crikey'', and archetypal phrases like ''Flat out like a lizard drinking'' are rarely heard without a sense of irony.

Other terms were never used in the first place. The much-quoted line &quot;''[[Shrimp_on_the_barbie|Throw another shrimp on the barbie]]''&quot; was a phrase that has never been used by Australians, but was a concoction of the Australian Tourist Commission for a US advertisement for tourism to Australia. &quot;[[Shrimp]]&quot; is an international English term — they are called [[prawns]] in Australia.

'''American Airlines Flight 11''' was an [[American Airlines]] flight aboard a [[Boeing 767-223ER]] [[aircraft]], registration number N334AA. Flight 11 regularly flew from [[Logan International Airport]] in [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], to [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. On [[September 11]], [[2001]], the aircraft on this route was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] in a [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attack]]; the hijackers crashed into the [[One World Trade Center tenants|North Tower]] of the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]].

[[Image:911 commission AA11 path.png|thumb|left|AA 11 flight path from Boston to New York City.]]
The regularly scheduled flight took off from Logan International Airport at 7:59 a.m., and the plane is believed to have been hijacked at 8:14. At around that time, when the plane stopped responding to [[air traffic control]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] had thought the plane had been hijacked. By 8:25, there was no doubt.

There were five hijackers believed to have participated in the hijacking. [[Mohamed Atta al Sayed]], the ringleader and pilot, was in seat 8D. [[Satam al-Suqami]], who had paid in cash that day, sat in seat 10B. [[Waleed al-Shehri]] sat in seat 2B, while [[Wail al-Shehri]] sat next to him in seat 2A. [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]], who had earlier flown with Atta to Logan Airport from Portland, Maine, was also on this flight. 

Some information about what had happened on board was sent by flight attendants on the plane. According to [[Madeline Amy Sweeney]] and [[Betty Ong]], three people&amp;ndash;two attendants and a passenger&amp;ndash;were stabbed or had their throats slashed by the hijackers. The passenger, [[Daniel M. Lewin|Daniel Lewin]], a notable [[Internet]] [[entrepreneur]], had also previously served as an officer in the elite [[Sayeret Matkal]] unit of the [[Israeli Defense Forces|Israeli military]]. A 2002 [[FAA]] memo referenced Lewin as possibly being killed by [[Satam al-Suqami]] after he attempted to stop the hijacking.

The first-class area had been sequestered by the surviving crew, and the rest of the passengers had been led to believe that a medical emergency was taking place in the first class area. The hijackers also used [[mace (spray)|mace]], [[pepper spray]], or some other [[aerosol spray]]-based [[tear gas|irritant]] to discourage entry into the first class area and the cockpit. One reported that her eyes were burning and that she was having trouble breathing. The hijackers claimed to have a bomb, although there is no evidence they actually had an explosive device.

At  8:46:40 a.m., Flight 11 was deliberately crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center between the 94th and 98th floors. This was the first crash in the attacks of the day. The plane was carrying 81 passengers (including the five hijackers) and 11 crew. All on board were killed, along with many hundreds in the building, and the tower later collapsed, killing hundreds more.

Although the impact itself caused extensive structural damage, it was the long-lasting fire, starting with burning jet fuel, which is blamed for the structural failure of the North Tower. Many have speculated that this is why the hijackers chose to use this fully fueled transcontinental flight. The centralized-support design (in the center core and exterior walls, instead of throughout) of the towers also contributed to the collapse. In a later recording, [[Osama bin Laden]] seemed to take credit for the attack, and stated that he did not expect the towers would collapse.

The [[flight route designation]] (flight number) for future flights on the same route at the same takeoff time was changed to &quot;Flight 25,&quot; to disassociate other planes from the one used in the attack and out of respect for those who had died in the attack. An American flag now flies on the jet bridge that Flight 11 departed from at Logan Airport.

The pilot on the flight was John Ogonowski, 52, of Dracut, Massachusetts.

{{Sep11}}
'''[[American Airlines]] Flight 77''' was a morning flight that routinely flew from [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] and [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun Counties, Virginia]], near [[Washington, D.C.]], to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (IAD-LAX). On [[September 11]], [[2001]], the [[Boeing 757-223]], N644AA, was hijacked as part of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attacks]].  The hijackers were reported to have been [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]], [[Majed Moqed]], [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]], [[Salem al-Hazmi]], and the suicide pilot [[Hani Hanjour]]. 

The flight was scheduled to depart at 8:10 AM EDT, but actually departed at 8:20. It was later determined that three of the hijackers had been stopped before boarding the flight because they failed the metal detector test, but were nonetheless allowed to enter the plane.

[[Image:911 commission AA77 path.png|thumb|left|AA 77 flight path from Dulles to Pentagon (to east of Dulles).]]
The flight was probably hijacked between 8:51 to 8:54. The assailants used knives and box-cutters to gain entrance to the [[cockpit]]. By 8:56, the flight was turned around, and the [[transponder]] had been disabled. The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] was aware at this point that there was an emergency aboard the plane. (By this time, [[American Airlines Flight 11]] had already crashed into the [[World Trade Center]], and [[United Airlines flight 175]] was known to have been hijacked as well.)

According to the 9/11 Commission Report, two passengers made phone calls to contacts on the ground. At 9:12, passenger Renee May was reported to have called her mother, Nancy May, in Las Vegas. She said her flight was being hijacked by six individuals and they had been moved to the rear of the plane. [[Barbara K. Olson]], another passenger, called her husband, [[United States Solicitor General]] [[Theodore Olson]] at the [[Justice Department]] twice to tell him about the hijacking and to report that the passengers and pilots were held in the back of the plane. After the call was cut off, Theodore Olson tried unsuccessfully to contact [[Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]].

Flight 77 crashed into the western side of [[The Pentagon]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], just south of [[Washington, D.C.]] at 9:37 AM EDT, killing all of its 58 passengers (including the hijackers) and 6 crew (but see [[#Disputes about the final destination of Flight 77|Disputes]] below). The section of the Pentagon hit consisted mainly of recently renovated, unoccupied offices, and was damaged by the crash and the ensuing violent fire. The crash and subsequent fire penetrated three outer ring sections of the western side. The outermost ring section was largely destroyed, and a large section collapsed. One hundred twenty-five people in the Pentagon died from the attack.

After the crash, the [[flight route designation]] for future flights on the same route was renumbered Flight 149.

Among American Airlines Flight 77 were 3 young schoolchildren, embarking on an educational trip to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary near Santa Barbara, California, as part of a program funded by the National Geographic Society.  The student names were Bernard Brown, 11, Asia Cotton, 11, and Rodney Dickens, also 11 years old.  Their chaperones; Sarah Clark, 65; James Debeuneure, 58; Ann Judge, 45; Hilda Taylor and Joe Ferguson also died.  

In total 5 passengers were under 12 years old.

==Disputes about the final destination of Flight 77==
{{main|9/11 conspiracy theories#The Pentagon}}

Some dispute the claim that Flight 77 struck the Pentagon. Claims that the Pentagon was not hit by a Boeing 757 have been raised based on photographs taken from the highway (hundreds of feet from the building) in which there is a seeming lack of debris and a lack of damage to the building or the lawn.  Those who believe that the Pentagon was not hit by a Boeing 757 allege that no pieces of a commercial aircraft were found, that the footage was confiscated, and other factors.  However, many of these claims have been refuted[http://911review.com/errors/pentagon/index.html],[http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/pentagontrap.html],[http://www.oilempire.us/pentagon.html].  Additionally, all of these theories must by definition ignore most of the [http://eric.bart.free.fr/iwpb/witness.html over 100 eyewitness testimonies] documented online which describe a commercial jet impacting the building.  None of these theories account for the fate of the aircraft after the above mentioned in-flight calls made by the passengers to their loved ones describing the hijacking.  Though some express doubts concerning the ability of making a successful cellphone call above 30,000 ft, others point out that cell phones are regularly used on private and corporate planes thousands of times every day without incident.

An '''ambush''' is a long established [[military tactics|military tactic]] in which an ambushing force uses [[concealment]] to attack an enemy that passes its position. Ambushers strike from concealed positions such as among dense [[underbrush]] or behind [[hill]]tops. The [[tactic]] is generally used to gather intelligence or to establish control over an area. Ambushes have been used consistently throughout history, from [[ancient warfare|ancient]] to [[modern warfare|modern]] [[warfare]].



==Procedure==
In modern warfare, an ambush is most often employed by ground troops up to [[platoon]] size against enemy targets which may be other ground troops or possibly vehicles. During ancient warfare, an ambush often might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale, such as over a [[mountain pass]].  

===Planning===
Ambushes are complex multi-phase operations and are therefore usually planned in some detail. First a suitable ''killing zone'' is identified.  This is the place where the ambush will be laid. It is generally a place where enemy units are expected to pass, and which gives reasonable cover for the deployment, execution, and extraction phases of the ambush patrol. A path along a wooded valley floor would be a stereotypical example.  

===Preparation===
To be successful an ambush patrol must deploy into the area covertly, ideally under the cover of darkness. The patrol will establish secure and covert positions overlooking the ''killing zone''. Usually, two or more ''cut off'' groups will be sent out a short distance from the main ambushing group into similarly covert positions.  Their job is twofold; firstly to give the ambush commander early-warning of approaching enemy (usually by radio), and secondly, when the ambush is initiated, to prevent any enemy from escaping. Another group will cover the rear of the ambush position and thus give [[all round defence]] to the ambush patrol.

Care must be taken by the ambush commander to ensure that fire from any weapon cannot inadvertently hit any other friendly unit.

===Waiting===
Having set the ambush, the next phase is to wait. This could be for a few hours or a few days depending on the tactical and supply situation. It is obviously much harder for an ambush patrol to remain covert and alert if sentry rosters, shelter, sleeping, sanitary arrangements, food and water, have to be considered. Ambush patrols will almost always have to be self-sufficient as re-supply would not be possible without compromising their covert position.

===Execution===
The arrival of an enemy in the area should be signalled by one of the cut-off units. This may be done by radio or by some other signal, but the enemy must not detect the signal.  The ambush commander will have given a clear instruction for initiating the ambush. This might be a burst from an automatic [[weapon]], use of an explosive device (such as a [[claymore mine]]or other directonal weapon), or possibly a simple whistle blast. When the ambush commander judges that the ambush will be most effective he gives the signal.  

After the [[firefight]] has been won, the now compromised ambush patrol will need to leave the area as soon as it is practical to do so. Before this is done it is a common practice to clear the killing zone by checking bodies for intelligence, taking prisoners, and treating any enemy wounded. If communication orders permit, a brief contact report may be sent. This done, the ambush patrol will leave the area by a pre-determined route.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''abzyme''' (from [[antibody]] and [[enzyme]]), also called ''catmab'' (from ''catalytic monoclonal antibody''), is a [[monoclonal antibody]] with [[catalytic activity]]. Molecules which are modified to gain new catalytic activity are called [[synzymes]]. Abzymes are usually artificial constructs, but are also found in normal humans (anti-vasoactive intestinal peptide autoantibodies) and in patients with the [[autoimmune disease]] systemic [[lupus erythematosus]], where they can bind and hydrolyze [[DNA]]. Abzymes are potential tools in [[biotechnology]], e.g., to perform specific actions on DNA.

Enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the transition state, thereby catalyzing the formation of an otherwise-less-favorable molecular intermediate between reactants and products.   If an antibody is developed to a stable molecule that's similar to an unstable intermediate of another (potentially unrelated) reaction, the developed antibody will enzymatically bind to and stabilize the intermediate state, thus catalyzing the reaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Adaptive radiation''' describes the rapid [[speciation]] of a single or a few [[species]] to fill many [[ecological niche]]s. This is an [[evolution]]ary process driven by [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]].

Adaptive radiation often occurs when a species is introduced to a new [[ecosystem]], or when a species can survive in an [[natural environment|environment]] that was unreachable before. For example, 14 species of [[Darwin's finch]]es on the [[Galapagos islands]] developed from a single species of [[finch]]es that reached the islands. Other examples include anoles of the Caribbean islands, Hawaiian silverswords and picture-winged fruit flies, the development of the first [[bird]]s, which suddenly were able to expand their [[territory]] into the air, or the development of [[lung fish]] during the [[Devonian period]], about 300 million years ago. Another example of adaptive radiation is the diversity within Phylum [[Mollusca]]. 

The dynamics of adaptive radiation are such that, within a relatively short time, many species derive from a single or a few ancestor species. The rise and fall of new species is now progressing very slowly, compared to the initial outburst of species.

There are three basic types of adaptive radiation. They are :
# '''General adaptation.''' A species that develops a radically new ability can reach new parts of its environment. An example of general adaptation is bird flight.
# '''Environmental change.''' A species that can, in contrast to the other species in the ecosystem, successfully survive in a radically changed environment will probably branch into new species that cover the new ecological niches created by the environmental change. An example of adaptive radiation as the result of an environmental change is the rapid spread and development of [[mammal]]ian species after the extinction of the dinosaurs.
# '''[[Archipelago]]es.''' Isolated [[ecosystem]]s, such as islands and mountain areas, can be colonized by a new species which upon establishing itself undergoes rapid divergent evolution. [[Darwin's finches]] are examples of adaptive radiation occurring in an archipelago.

In [[science fiction]] sometimes adaptive radiation of [[human]]s is imagined. This often makes for interesting multi-species [[science fiction universe|worlds]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:DNA Agarose Gel Electrophor.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Digital printout of an agarose gel electrophoresis of ''cat''-insert plasmid DNA]]
'''Agarose gel electrophoresis''' is a method used in [[molecular biology]] to separate [[DNA]] strands by size, and to determine the size of the separated strands by comparison to strands of known length.  Similarly, in [[proteomics|proteomics research]], this method is also used to separate and quantify proteins based on their charge and size.  

Electrophoresis uses a mechanism similar to sifting objects through a sieve.  In the case of DNA-based gel electrophoresis, an [[electric field]] is used to push negatively charged DNA molecules through a gel matrix. Shorter, more compact DNA molecules move faster than longer, more convoluted ones since they are able to slip through the matrix more easily.  The same general principal applies to protein separation although more variables exist to determine how a protein will run through a gel.  DNA-based gel electrophoresis can be used for the separation of DNA fragments of 50 [[base pair]]s up to several megabases (millions of bases).  Large DNA molecules are only able to move end on in a process called &quot;reptation&quot; and are more difficult to separate.  In general the lower the concentration of agarose, the larger is the ideal size of a molecule to be resolved up to 750,000 bp.  The disadvantage of lower concentrations is the long run times (sometimes days) and the problem of handling the fragile gel.

The rate of migration is affected by a number of factors.  The concentration of agarose is one that has been mentioned.  The conformation of DNA is also a factor and is demonstrated by the forms of a [[plasmid]]: supercoiled, nicked, linear and single-stranded.  Each conformation runs at a different rate, with supercoiled running the fastest and linear running the slowest.  The presence of [[ethidium bromide]] (EtBr) in the gel causes DNA to run slower, as EtBr intercalates and uncoils DNA.  EtBr has the unique property of fluorescing under UV light. By running DNA through an EtBr-treated gel and exposing it to UV light, distinct bands of DNA become visible. The voltage is also a factor in migration and can only be so high before a decrease in resolution (about 5 to 8 V/cm).  Loading buffers are added with the DNA in order to visualize it and sediment it in the gel well.  Negatively charged indicators keep track of the position of the DNA.  Bromphenol Blue and Xylene cyanol FF are used and run at about 300 bp and 4 kbp respectively. 

There are a number of buffers used for agarose electrophoresis, but only two will be mentioned here: tris acetate [[EDTA]] (TAE), and [[sodium boride]] (SB).  TAE has the lowest buffering capacity but provides the best resolution.  This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product.  SB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5kb but it has the highest buffering capacity allowing voltages up to 350 V&lt;ref&gt;Sambrook J, Russel DW (2001).

==Material==

For an agarose gel electrophoresis, several items are needed:
* The DNA that is to be separated.
* A [[DNA ladder]], a mixture of DNA fragments (usually 10-20) of known size. The size of the DNA strands that are separated is determined by comparison of their relative position to that of the DNA strands of the DNA ladder. There are several DNA ladder mixes commercially available.
* [[Buffer solution]], usually [[TBE]] or TAE 0.5x, pH 8.0
* [[Agarose]]
* [[Ethidium bromide]] (5.25 mg/ml in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)
* [[Nitrile]] gloves
* A color marker containing a low [[molecular weight]] [[dye]] such as &quot;[[bromophenol blue]]&quot; (to enable tracking the progress of the electrophoresis) and glycerol (to make the DNA solution more dense so it will sink into the wells of the gel).
* A gel rack
* A &quot;comb&quot; (usually cut from a sheet of [[teflon]])

==Preparation==
There are several methods for preparing agarose gels.  A common example is shown here.  Other methods might differ in the buffering system used, the sample size to be loaded, the total volume of the gel (typically thickness is kept to a minimum while length and breadth are varied as needed), and whether the gel is prepared horizontally or vertically (the vast majority of agarose gels used in modern molecular biology are prepared and run horizontally).

# Make a 1% agarose solution in 0.5x [[TBE]]. If you analyze small DNA strands, go up to 2%. Use 15-70 ml, depending on the size of the gel.
# Boil solution, preferably in a [[microwave oven]].
# Let the solution cool down to about 60 °C at room temperature. Stir the solution while cooling.
# Add 1 ul ethidium bromide per 10 ml gel solution. '''Wear gloves from here on, [[ethidium bromide]] is a potent [[mutagen]] ''(nitrile gloves recommended)'' !''' Some researchers prefer not to add ethidium bromide to the gel itself, instead soaking the gel in an ethidium bromide solution after running.
# Stir the solution to disperse the ethidium bromide, then fill it into the gel rack.
# Insert the comb at one side of the gel, about 5-10 mm from the border of the gel.
# When the gel has cooled down and become solid, remove the comb. The holes that remain in the gel are the slots.
# Put the gel, together with the rack, into a chamber with 0.5x TBE. Make sure the gel is completely covered with TBE, and that the slots are at the electrode that will have the negative current.
# Add the color marker to the DNA ladder is usually already stained.

==Procedure==
After the gel has been prepared, use a micropipette to inject about 25 µl of stained DNA (a DNA ladder is also highly recommended). Close the lid of the electrophoresis chamber and apply current (typically 100 V for 30 minutes with 15 ml of gel). The colored dye in the DNA ladder and DNA samples acts as a &quot;front wave&quot; that runs faster than the DNA itself. When the &quot;front wave&quot; approaches the end of the gel, the current is stopped. It is now possible to visualize the DNA (stained with ethidium bromide) with [[ultraviolet]] light.

[[image:Agarose Gel Electrophoresis.png|frame|none|Figure 1: Schematic drawing of the electrophoresis process, see text for description of steps]]

Steps:
#The agarose gel with three slots (S). 
#Injection of DNA ladder ([[molecular weight]] markers) into the first slot. 
#DNA ladder injected. Injection of samples into the second and third slot.
#A current is applied. The DNA moves toward the positive [[anode]] due to the negative charges on its [[phosphate]] backbone.
#Small DNA strands move fast, large DNA strands move slowly through the gel. The DNA is not normally visible during this process, so the marker dye is added to the DNA to avoid the DNA being run entirely off the gel. The marker dye has a low molecular weight, and migrates faster than the DNA, so as long as the marker has not run past the end of the gel, the DNA will still be in the gel. 
#The DNA is spread over the whole gel. The electrophoresis process is finished.

Illuminate the gel with an [[ultraviolet]] lamp (usually by placing it on a light box) to view the DNA bands - ethidium bromide [[fluorescence|fluoresces]] pink in the presence of DNA.  Wear protective glasses! The DNA band can also be cut out of the gel, and can then be dissolved to retrieve the purified DNA.

==Analysis==
Modern day gel electrophoresis research often leverages software-based image analysis tools, such as those used in [[two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]], or 2-DE.  In [[proteomics|proteomics research]], these tools primarily analyze bio-markers by quantifying individual, and showing the separation between one or more protein &quot;spots&quot; on a scanned image of a 2-DE product.  Additionally, these tools match spots between gels of similar samples to show, for example, proteomic differences between early and advanced stages of an illness.  Two leading tools in this study are [http://www.bio-rad.com PDQuest] and [http://support.nonlinear.com/products/2d/progenesis.asp Progenesis Workstation].  While this technology is widely utilized, the intelligence has not been perfected yet.  For example, while both of the aforementioned tools tend to agree on the quantification and analysis of well-defined well-separated protein spots, they deliver different results and tendencies with less-defined less-separated spots.&lt;ref&gt;Arora, Pankaj S., et al. (2005). Comparative evaluation of two two-dimensional gel electrophoresis image analysis software applications using synovial fluids from patients with joint disease.

      <comment>Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/67.83.116.136|67.83.116.136]] ([[User talk:67.83.116.136|talk]]) to last version by Vsmith</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''allele''' is any one of a number of viable DNA codings of the same [[gene]] (sometimes the term refers to a non-gene sequence) occupying a given [[locus]] (position) on a [[chromosome]]. An individual's [[genotype]] for that gene will be the set of alleles it happens to possess. In an organism which has two copies of each of its chromosomes (a [[diploid]] organism), two alleles make up the individual's genotype.

An example is the gene for blossom color in many species of [[flower]] -- a single gene controls the color of the [[petals]], but there may be several different versions of the gene. One version might result in red petals, while another might result in white petals. The color of an individual flower will depend on which two alleles it possesses for this color gene, and how the two interact.

Organisms that are [[diploid]] have paired [[homologous]] chromosomes in their [[somatic cell]]s, and these contain two copies of each gene. An organism in which the two copies of the gene are identical -- that is, have the same allele -- is said to be [[homozygote|homozygous]] for that gene. An organism which has two different alleles of the gene is said to be [[heterozygote|heterozygous]]. [[phenotype|Phenotypes]] (the expressed characteristics) associated with a certain allele can sometimes be [[dominant gene|dominant]] or [[recessive]], but often they are neither. A dominant phenotype will be expressed when only one allele of its associated type is present, whereas a recessive phenotype will only be expressed when both alleles are of its associated type.

However, there are exceptions to the way heterozygotes express themselves in the phenotype.  One exception is [[incomplete dominance]] (sometimes called [[blending inheritance]]) when alleles blend their traits in the phenotype.  An example of this would be seen if, when crossing [[Antirrhinum]]s -- flowers with incompletely dominant &quot;red&quot; and &quot;white&quot; alleles for petal color -- the resulting offspring had pink petals.  Another exception is [[co-dominance]], where both alleles are active and both traits are expressed at the same time; for example, both red and white petals in the same bloom or red and white flowers on the same plant. Codominance is also apparent in human [[blood type]]s. A person with one &quot;A&quot; blood type allele and one &quot;B&quot; blood type allele would have a blood type of &quot;AB&quot;.

A [[wild type]] allele is an allele which is considered to be &quot;normal&quot; for the organism in question, as opposed to a [[mutant]] allele which is usually a relatively new modification.

(Note that with the advent of the study of [[genetic marker]]s, the term allele is often now used to refer to DNA codings in [[junk DNA]]. For example, the term [[allele frequency]] tables are often presented for genetic markers, such as the [[DYS (DNA)|DYS]] markers.)

==Equations==
There are two simple equations for the frequency of two alleles of a given gene (see [[Hardy-Weinberg principle]]):

Equation 1:&lt;math&gt;p^2+2pq+q^2=1&lt;/math&gt;

Equation 2: &lt;math&gt;p+q=1&lt;/math&gt;

Where p is the frequency of one allele and q is the frequency of the other allele. p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the population fraction that is homozygous for the p allele, 2pq is the frequency of heterozygotes and q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the population fraction that is homozygous for the q allele. [[Natural selection]] can act on p and q in Equation 1, and obviously affect the frequency of genes seen in Equation 2. It should be noted that the second equation can be derived from the first (or vice versa) since &lt;math&gt;p^2+2pq+q^2=1&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;(p+q)^2=1&lt;/math&gt; and p and q are positive numbers.

'''Ampicillin''' (C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S ; [[CAS registry number|CAS No.]]: 69-53-4) is an [[aminopenicillin]] and, as such, is a broad-spectrum [[antibiotic]] and has been used extensively to treat [[bacterium|bacterial]] [[infection]]s since [[1961]]. It can sometimes result in allergic reactions that range in severity from a rash to potentially lethal [[anaphylaxis]].

Belonging to the group of [[beta-lactam]] antibiotics, ampicillin is able to penetrate [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. It inhibits the third and final stage of bacterial [[cell wall]] synthesis, which ultimately leads to cell [[lysis]]. Ampicillin is closely related to [[Amoxicillin]], another type of [[penicillin]], and both are used to treat [[urinary tract infections]], [[otitis media]], uncomplicated community acquired [[pneumonia]], [[Haemophilus influenzae]], invasive [[salmonella]] and [[Listeriosis|Listeria]] [[meningitis]]. It is used with [[Flucloxacillin]] in the combination antibiotic [[Co-fluampicil]] for [[empiric]] treatment of [[cellulitis]]; providing cover against [[Group A streptococcal infection]] whilst the Flucloxacillin acts against [[Staphylococcus aureus]].

Ampicillin is often used in [[molecular biology]] as a test for the uptake of [[gene]]s (e.g., by [[plasmid]]s) by bacteria (e.g., ''[[E. coli]]''). A gene that is to be inserted into a bacterium is coupled to a gene [[code for|coding for]] an ampicillin resistance (in ''E. coli'', usually the ''bla'' gene, coding for [[beta-lactamase|&amp;beta;-lactamase]]). The treated bacteria are then grown on a medium containing ampicillin. Only the bacteria that successfully take up the desired genes become ampicillin resistant, and therefore contain the other desired gene as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Antibiotic resistance''' is the ability of a [[microorganism]] to withstand the effects of an [[antibiotic]].
Antibiotic resistance naturally develops via [[natural selection]] through random [[mutation]] and [[plasmid]] exchange between [[bacterium|bacteria]] of the same [[species]].  Antibiotic resistance can also be introduced artificially into a microorganism through [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] protocols.  If a bacterium carries several resistance genes, it is called '''multiresistant''' or, informally, a '''superbug'''.

==Causes==
Antibiotic resistance is a consequence of [[evolution]] via [[natural selection]].  The antibiotic action is an environmental pressure; those bacteria which have a mutation allowing them to survive will live on to reproduce.  They will then pass this trait to their offspring, which will be a fully resistant generation.

Several studies have demonstrated that patterns of antibiotic usage greatly affect the number of resistant organisms which develop. Overuse of [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]]s, such as second- and third-generation [[cephalosporin]]s, greatly hastens the development of methicillin resistance, even in organisms that have never been exposed to the selective pressure of methicillin ''per se''. [Thus the resistance was already present.] Other factors contributing towards resistance include incorrect diagnosis, unnecessary prescriptions, improper use of antibiotics by patients, and the use of antibiotics as livestock food additives for growth promotion.

==Resistant pathogens==
''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (colloquially known as &quot;Staph aureus&quot;) is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membranes]] and the [[skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was the first bacterium in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found -- in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice. MRSA ([[Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']]) was first detected in Britain in 1961 and is now &quot;quite common&quot; in hospitals. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of blood poisoning in the UK in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the US are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

This left [[vancomycin]] as the only effective agent available at the time.  However, VRSA ([[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Vancomycin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']]) was first identified in Japan in 1997, and has since been found in hospitals in England, France and the US. VRSA is also termed GISA (glycopeptide intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'') or VISA (vancomycin intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus''), indicating resistance to all [[Glycopeptide antibiotic|glycopeptide]] antibiotics.

A new class of antibiotics, [[Linezolid|oxazolidinone]]s, became available in the 1990s, and the first commercially available oxazolidinone, [[linezolid]], is comparable to vancomycin in effectiveness against MRSA. Linezolid-resistance in ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' was reported in 2003.

''[[enterococcus|Enterococcus faecium]]'' is another superbug found in hospitals: penicillin resistance was seen in 1983, vancomycin resistance (VRE) in 1987 and [[linezolid]] resistance (LRE) in the late 1990s.

Penicillin-resistant [[pneumonia]] (or pneumococcus, caused by ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'') was first detected in 1967, as was penicillin-resistant [[gonorrhea]]. Resistance to penicillin substitutes is also known beyond ''S. aureus''. By 1993 ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' was resistant to five [[quinolones|fluoroquinolone]] variants. ''[[tuberculosis|Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' is commonly resistant to [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampin]] and sometimes universally resistant to the common treatments. Other pathogens showing some resistance include ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]]'', and ''[[Streptococci]]''.

In November, 2004, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported an increasing number of ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'' bloodstream infections in patients at military medical facilities in which service members injured in the [[Iraq]]/[[Kuwait]] region during [[Iraq war|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and in [[Afghanistan]] during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] were treated. Most of these showed [[multidrug resistance]] (MRAB), with a few isolates resistant to all drugs tested.  [http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5345a1.htm]

==Antibiotic resistance and the role of animals==
[[Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus|MRSA ]] is acknowledged to be a human commensal and pathogen.  MRSA has been found in cats, dogs and horses, where it can cause the same problems as it does in humans.  Owners can transfer the organism to their pets and vice-versa, and MRSA in animals is generally believe to be derived from humans.

This is not the case for other pathogens, however.  There are concerns that some antibiotic resistant organisms may derive from the use of antibiotics in food animals.  15% of all antibiotics manufactured in Europe are used on animals.  For precisely this reason, in many countries, antibiotics that are licensed for human use are banned from use in animals.  However, related antbiotics are often used as growth promoters (particularly in poultry) and have been associated with the development of resistant strains.

The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] banned [[enrofloxacin]] from use in poultry in July 2005.  [[Campylobacter]] is an avian gut [[commensal]], and Campylobacter [[gastroenteritis]] in humans is associated with the consumption of undercooked chicken.  Campylobacter resistance is up to 20% in parts of the developed world.  Enrofloxacin is a [[fluoroquinolone]] whose mechanism of action is very similar to ciprofloxacin;  it is used in veterinary practice to treat respiratory infections of poultry, when it is added to water or to the feed and may be used to medicate a whole flock.  Farmers lobby groups often agitate that there is no evidence of the transfer of antibiotic resistance in food animals to humans, but given Campylobacter does not naturally occur in humans and that ciprofloxacin resistance is increasing, it is difficult not to draw the conclusion that ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter in humans arises from eating enrofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter in chickens, hence the FDA ban on [[enrofloxacin]].

The illegal use of [[amantadine]] to medicate poultry in the South of China and other parts of southeast Asia, means that although the H5N1 strain that appear in Hong Kong in 1997 was amantadine sensitive, the more recent strains have all been amantadine resistant.  This seriously reduces the treatment options available to doctors in the event of an influenza pandemic.

Eighteen UK organisations banded together in November 1997 to set guidelines on the use of antibiotics in farm animals, in order to address the concerns of the larger public.  The consortium is called RUMA ([[Responsible use of Medicine in Agriculture Alliance]]) Members of this consortium include the [[British Poultry Council]] and various industry and pharmaceutical firms.  The European Union has banned the use of all antibiotics as growth promoters from [[1 January]] [[2006]].

==Alternatives to antibiotics==
===Prevention===
[[Hand washing|Wash hands properly]] to reduce the chance of getting sick and spreading infection. Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly. Avoid raw eggs and undercooked meat, especially  in ground form.

Do not ''demand'' antibiotics from your physician; if antibiotics are not prescribed, there is a reason.

When given antibiotics, take them '''''exactly''''' as prescribed, and complete the full course of treatment; do '''''not''''' hoard pills for later use, or share leftover antibiotics.

===Vaccines===
[[Vaccine]]s do not suffer the problem of resistance because a vaccine enhances the body's natural defenses, while an antibiotic operates separately from the body's normal defenses. Nevertheless, new strains may evolve that escape immunity induced by vaccines.

While theoretically promising, anti-staphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy, because of immunological variation between ''Staphylococcus'' species, and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced. Development and testing of more effective vaccines is under way.

===Phage therapy=== 
[[Phage therapy]] is a more recent alternative that can cope with the problem of resistance.

==Development of newer antibiotics==
The resistance problem demands that a renewed effort be made to seek antibacterial agents effective against pathogenic bacteria resistant to current antibiotics. One of the possible strategies towards this objective is the rational localization of bioactive phytochemicals. Plants have an almost limitless ability to synthesize aromatic substances, most of which are phenols or their oxygen-substituted derivatives such as tannins. Most are secondary metabolites, of which at least 12,000 have been isolated, a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total{{fact}}. In many cases, these substances serve as plant defense mechanisms against predation by microorganisms, insects, and herbivores.  Many of  the herbs and spices used by humans to season food yield useful medicinal compounds including those having antibacterial activity.

Traditional healers have long used plants to prevent or cure infectious conditions. Many of these plants have been investigated scientifically for antimicrobial activity and a large number of plant products have been shown to inhibit growth of pathogenic bacteria. A number of these agents appear to have structures and modes of action that are distinct from those of the antibiotics in current use, suggesting that cross-resistance with agents already in use may be minimal.

      <comment>/* Origin of antigens */  added autoantigen</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''antigen''' is a substance that stimulates an [[immune system|immune]] response, especially the production of [[antibodies]]. ''Antigens'' are usually [[protein]]s or [[polysaccharide]]s, but can be any type of molecule, including small molecules ([[hapten]]s) coupled to a [[carrier-protein]].
 
==Types of antigens==
*'''Immunogen''' - Any substance that provokes the immune response when introduced into the body. An immunogen is always a [[macromolecule]] (protein, polysaccharide). Its ability to stimulate the immune reaction depends on its commoness to the host, molecular size, chemical composition and heterogeneity (e.g. simlar to amino acids in a protein).
*'''Tolerogen''' - An antigen that invokes a specific immune non-responsiveness due to its [[molecular form]]. If its molecular form is changed, a tolerogen can become an immunogen. 
*'''Allergen''' - An allergen is a substance that causes the [[allergic reaction]]. It can be ingested, inhaled, injected or comes into contact with skin.

Cells present their antigens to the et via a [[histocompatibility molecule]]. Depending on the antigen presented and the type of the histocompatibility molecule, several types of [[immune cell]]s can become activated.

==Origin of antigens==
We can also classify antigens according to their origin.

===Exogenous antigens===
Exogenous antigens are antigens that have entered the body from the outside, for example by inhalation, ingestion, or injection. By [[endocytosis]] or [[phagocytosis]], these antigens are taken into the [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APCs) and processed into fragments. APCs then present the fragments to [[T helper cells]] ([[CD4]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) by the use of [[Major histocompatibility complex|class II histocompatibility molecule]]s on their surface. Some T cells are specific for the peptide:MHC complex. They become activated and start to secrete [[cytokine]]s. Cytokines are substances that can activate [[cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] (CTL), antibody-secreting [[B cells]], [[macrophages]] and other cells.

===Endogenous antigens===
Endogenous antigens are antigens that have been generated within the cell, as a result of normal cell [[metabolism]], or because of viral or intracellular bacterial [[infection]]. The fragments are then presented on the cell surface in the complex with [[class I histocompatibility molecule]]s. If activated cytotoxic CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[Cytotoxic T cell|T cell]]s recognize them, the T cells begin to secrete different [[toxin]]s that cause the [[lysis]] or [[apoptosis]] of the infected cell. In order to keep the cytotoxic cells from killing cells just for presenting self-proteins, self-reactive T cells are deleted from the repertoire as a result of [[central tolerance]] (also known as [[negative selection]] which occurs in the [[thymus]]). Only those CTL that do not react to self-peptides that are presented in the thymus in the context of [[MHC class I]] molecules are allowed to enter the bloodstream.

There is an exception to the exogenous/endogenous antigen paradigm, called [[cross-presentation]].

===Autoantigens===
An [[autoantigen]] is usually a normal protein or complex of proteins (and sometimes DNA or RNA) that is recognized by the immune system of patients suffering from a specific [[autoimmune disease]]. These antigens should under normal conditions not be the target of the immune system, but due to mainly genetic and enviromental factors the normal [[immunological tolerance]] for such an antigen has been lost in these patients.

==Tumor antigens==
'''Tumor antigens''' are those antigens that are presented by the [[MHC I]] molecules on the surface of [[tumor cell]]s. These antigens can sometimes be presented only by tumor cells and never by the normal ones. In this case, they are called '''tumor-specific antigens''' and typically result from a tumor specific mutation. More common are antigens that are presented by tumor cells and normal cells, and they are called '''tumor-associated antigens'''. [[Cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] that recognized these antigens may be able to destroy the tumor cells before they proliferate or [[metastasize]]. 

Tumor antigens can also be on the surface of the tumor in the form of, for example, a mutated receptor, in which case they will be recognized by [[B cells]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''autosome''' is a non-sex [[chromosome]]. It is an ordinary paired chromosome that is the same in both [[sex]]es of a [[species (biology)|species]]. For example, in humans, there are 22 pairs of autosomes. The X and Y chromosomes are not autosomal.

Non-autosomal chromosomes are usually referred to as [[sex chromosome]]s or, less frequently, as gonosomes.

===Uses===
An ''autosomal dominant gene'' is one on an autosome that is always expressed, even if a single copy exists. The chance is 1:2 for passing this gene to offspring. There are 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{lowercase|title=al-Qaeda }}
[[Image:Osama-med.jpg|thumb|right|[[Osama bin Laden]], founder of al-Qaeda, in the 1990's.]]

'''al-Qaeda''' ({{lang-ar|القاعدة}}, ''el-Qā‘idah'' or ''al-Qā‘idah''; &quot;the foundation&quot; or &quot;the base&quot;) is the name given to an international [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] campaign comprised of independent and collaborative cells that all profess the same cause of reducing outside influence upon [[Islam]]ic affairs.  Though al-Qaeda is philosophically heterogeneous, prominent members of the movement are considered to have [[Salafi]] beliefs.

The [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States]] (9/11 Commission) says that al-Qaeda is responsible for a large number of high-profile, violent attacks against civilians, military targets, and commercial institutions in both the west and the Muslim world. The [[9/11 Commission Report]] attributed the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], [[The Pentagon]] in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] and Flight 93 in Pennsylvania to al-Qaeda. 

Although the group may have been directly responsible for these attacks, many respected observers such as [[Michael Scheuer]], an ex-[[CIA]] terrorism analyst, believe that al-Qaeda has evolved into a ''movement'' &quot;...where the [[jihad]] is self-sustaining, where Islamic warriors fight America with or without allegiance to al-Qaeda’s bin Laden, and where the name 'al-Qaeda' provides the inspiration for subsequent international attacks.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Experts fear 'endless' terror war | work=MSNBC.com | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8524679 | accessdate=July 9 | accessyear=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of al-Qaeda can be traced to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion of [[Afghanistan]], when a cadre of non-Afghani, [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] fighters joined the largely [[United States]] and [[Pakistan]]-funded Afghan [[mujahideen|mujāhidīn]] anti-Russian resistance movement.  [[Osama bin Laden]], a member of a prominent Saudi Arabian business family, led an informal grouping which became a leading fundraiser and recruitment agency for the Afghan cause in Muslim countries; it channelled Islamic fighters to the conflict, distributed money and provided logistical skills and resources to both fighting forces and Afghan refugees. 

After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989 many committed veterans of the war wished to fight for Islamic causes elsewhere. The invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraq in 1990 saw US and coalition troops sent to Saudi Arabia in preparedness for expelling Iraqi occupying forces from Kuwait. Al-Qaeda was strongly opposed to the secular regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] and bin Laden had offered use of his fighters' services to the Saudi throne, but the deployment of 'infidel' forces to Islamic sacred territory was seen as an act of treachery by bin Laden. He placed the grouping in militant opposition to the [[United States]] and its allies.  Al-Qaeda came to claim that the U.S. is oppressive toward Muslims citing U.S. support for [[Israel]] in the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], the US military presence in several Islamic countries (particularly Saudi Arabia) and latterly the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq, (&quot;[[Iraq war]]&quot;) as reasons for militant action.

[[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] are senior members of al-Qaeda's [[shura]] council, and are believed to be in contact with some of al-Qaeda's other cells.

==Overview==
In formal communications, Bin Laden has preferred to use the '''International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders''' as the name for the grouping rather than &quot;al-Qaeda&quot;. 
[[Image:Zawahiri.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ayman al-Zawahiri]].]]
While common usage of the name &quot;al-Qaeda&quot; dates from much earlier, 2001 saw the first formal use of the name &quot;al-Qaeda&quot; for the grouping when the American government decided to prosecute Bin Laden in his absence using anti-Mafia laws that required the existence of a named criminal organisation. Bin Laden himself is probably the best source for the origin of the al-Qaeda label. Speaking in 2001 he said: &quot;The name 'al Qaeda' was established a long time ago by mere chance. The late Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri established the training camps for our mujahedeen against Russia's terrorism. We used to call the training camp al Qaeda [meaning 'the base' in English]. And the name stayed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Transcript of Bin Laden's October interview | work=CNN.com | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/02/05/binladen.transcript/index.html | accessdate=February 2 | accessyear=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Al-Qaeda's philosophical inspiration comes from the writings of [[Sayyid Qutb]], a prominent thinker from the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], whose essays inspired most of the principal militant [[Islamism|Islamist]] movements in the Middle East today. Though it adheres to no particular sect, in general its philosophy is [[Salafist]]. It calls for an armed Islamist [[revolution]] to foment the overthrow of all regimes which do not rule by Islamic law and to enforce the expulsion of Western military and commercial interests from all Muslim countries.

According to statements broadcast by al-Qaeda on the internet and on satellite TV channels, the ultimate goal of al-Qaeda is to re-establish the [[Caliphate]] across the Islamic world, by working with allied Islamic extremist groups to overthrow secular or Western-supported regimes. Anti-Israeli sentiments are often expressed.  In a 1997 interview with Peter Arnett, Osama bin Laden cites America's presence in the Middle East and its support for Israel as the chief reasons for his organization's actions.

Al-Qaeda believes that western governments, and particularly the American government, act against the interests of Muslims. Their grievances have included: the provision of economic and military support to regimes perceived by al-Qaeda as oppressive of Muslims (particularly the US and its support for Israel), the vetoing of United Nations condemnations of Israel, attempts to influence the affairs of Islamic governments and communities, direct support by means of arms or loans for anti-Islamist Arab regimes, maintaining a troop presence in Muslim countries, especially in Saudi Arabia, and (although al-Qaeda has a long history of opposition to Saddam Hussein) the American and British [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

Besides the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York]] and [[the Pentagon]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], al-Qaeda is believed to have been implicitly involved in the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], and [[Dar-Es-Salaam]], [[Tanzania]], the [[USS Cole bombing|attack on the USS Cole]], the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], as well as many attacks on people in and of other nations around the world.

The military leader of al-Qaeda is widely reported to have been [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]], who was arrested in [[Pakistan]] in 2003. Its previous military leader, [[Mohammed Atef]], was killed in a U.S. bombing raid on [[Afghanistan]] in late 2001.

==History of al-Qaeda==
===Afghan jihad===
[[Image:Mujahidin3-250.jpg|thumb|right|275px|A Mujahid (plural:Mujahidin) during the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Photo by Del Boone]]
Al-Qaeda evolved from the [[Maktab al-Khadamat]] (Office of Services, MAK) — a [[mujahideen|Mujahidin]] organization fighting to establish an Islamic state during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] in the [[1980s]]. Original funding was fosterd by the [[CIA]]. Osama bin Laden was a founding member of the MAK, along with [[Palestinian]] militant [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam]]. The role of the MAK was to channel funds from a variety of sources (including donations from across the Middle East) into training [[mujahideen|Mujahidin]] from around the world in guerrilla combat, and to transport the combatants to Afghanistan. The MAK was mostly funded by donations from wealthy Muslim individuals but was also allegedly aided by the governments of [[Pakistan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], and indirectly by the [[United States]], which channeled much of its support via the Pakistani intelligence service, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Directorate. During the latter half of the 1980s, the MAK was a relatively minor grouping in Afghanistan with no direct combatants; rather it limited its activities to fundraising, logistics, housing, education, refugee care, recruitment and the financing of other mujahideen.

After a protracted and costly war lasting nine years, the Soviet Union finally withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989. [[Mohammed Najibullah]]'s socialist Afghan government was rapidly overthrown by elements of the Mujahidin. With Mujahidin leaders unable to agree on a structure for governance, anarchy ensued with ever-changing control of ill-defined territories falling under constantly reorganising alliances and schisms between regional warlords.

===Outreach from Afghanistan===
Toward the end of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military mission to Afghanistan, some [[mujahideen|Mujahidin]] wanted to expand their operations to include Islamist struggles in other parts of the world. A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed to further those aspirations.

One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda which was formed by Osama bin Laden in 1988. Bin Laden wished to extend the conflict to nonmilitary operations in other parts of the world; Azzam, in contrast, wanted to remain focused on military campaigns. After Azzam was assassinated in 1989, the MAK split, with a significant number joining bin Laden's organization.

===Gulf War and start of US enmity===
Following the Soviet Union withdrawal from Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden returned to [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 had put the Saudi Arabian ruling House of Saud at risk both from internal dissent and the perceived possibility of further Iraqi expansionism. In the face of seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia's own forces were well armed but outnumbered.  Bin Laden offered the services of his mujahideen to [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army.  But from the strategic viewpoint, were Iraqi forces to be ejected from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia provided the only possible land-bridge whereby international troops could assemble in order that the Iraqi invasion could be repulsed. 

After some deliberation the Saudi Monarch refused bin Laden's offer and instead opted to allow United States and allied forces to deploy on his territory.  Bin Laden considered this a treacherous deed. He believed that the presence of foreign troops in the &quot;land of the two mosques&quot; ([[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]) profaned sacred soil. After speaking publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops he was quickly forced into exile to Sudan and his Saudi citizenship was revoked. 

Shortly afterwards the movement which came to be known as al-Qaeda was formed.

===Sudan===
In 1991, Sudan's [[National Islamic Front]], an Islamist group that had recently gained power, invited al-Qaeda to move operations to their country. For several years, al-Qaeda ran several businesses (including an import/export business, farms, and a construction firm) in what might be considered a period of financial consolidation. The group was responsible for the construction of a major 1200km (845mi) highway connecting the capital Khartoum with Port Sudan. But they also ran a number of camps where they trained aspirants in the use of firearms and explosives.

In 1996, Osama bin Laden was asked to leave Sudan after the US put the regime under extreme pressure to expel him, citing possible connections to the 1994 attempted assassination of [[Egypt|Egyptian]] President [[Hosni Mubarak]] while his motorcade was in [[Addis Ababa, Ethiopia]].  A controversy exists regarding whether Sudan offered to turn bin Laden over to the U.S. prior to the expulsion.  The Sudanese government never indeed made such an offer but were prepared to turn him over to Saudi Arabia who declined to take him. 

Osama bin Laden finally left Sudan in a well planned and executed operation accompanied by some 200 of his supporters and their families travelling directly to Jalalabad, Afghanistan by air in late 1996.

===Bosnia===
The secession of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] from the multicultural [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian Federation]] and the subsequent declaration of Bosnia-Herzegovinan independence in October 1991 opened up a new ethnic and quasi-religious conflict at the heart of Europe. 	 

[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was ethnically diverse, with a nominal Muslim majority but with significant numbers of ethnic ([[Orthodox Christian]]) [[Serbs]] and ([[Roman Catholic]]) [[Croats]] distributed across its territory. It comprised a large, but militarily weak component of the former Yugoslavia and Yugoslavian disintegration saw some ethnic Serbs and some ethnic Croats within Bosnia, supported by their rump adjacent states (Serbia and Croatia), engage in a three way conflict against the [[Bosniaks]] dominated core. 	 

Radical Arab veterans of the war against the Soviets in [[Afghanistan]] seized on Bosnia as a new opportunity to &quot;defend Islam&quot;. Besieged on two fronts and seemingly abandoned by the West, the Bosnian regime was willing to accept any help it could get, military or financial, including that of a number of Islamic organisations, of which al-Qaeda was one&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Kohlmann, Evan F. | title = Al-Qaida's Jihad in Europe: The Afghan-Bosnian Network | publisher = Berg | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 1859738079}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Several close associates of Osama bin Laden (most notably, Saudi [[Khalid bin Udah bin Muhammad al-Harbi]], alias Abu Sulaiman al-Makki) joined the conflict in Bosnia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kohlmann, Evan F. | title = Al-Qaida's Jihad in Europe: The Afghan-Bosnian Network  | publisher=Berg | year=2004 | id=ISBN 1859738079}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but while al-Qaeda might initially have seen Bosnia as a possible bridgehead enabling the radicalisation of European Muslims for operations against other European states and America, [[Bosniaks]] had been secularised for generations and their interest in fighting was largely limited to securing the survival of their nascent state. 	 

The &quot;Bosnian Mujahidin&quot; (comprising largely Arab veterans of the Afghan war and not ''necessarily'' members of al-Qaeda) thus operated as a largely autonomous force within central Bosnia. While their bravery in the fray initially attracted a small number of native Bosnians to join them, their brutality and a rising number of atrocites committed against civilians came to appall many native Bosnians and repelled new recruits. At the same time, their vigorous attempts to Islamicize the local population with rules on appropriate dress and behaviour were widely resented and largely went unheeded. In his book ''Al-Qaida’s Jihad in Europe: the Afghan-Bosnian network'', Evan Kohlmann sums up: ‘In spite of vigorous efforts to ‘Islamicise’ the nominally Muslim Bosnian populace, the locals could not be convinced to abandon pork, alcohol, or public displays of affection. Bosnian women persistently refused to wear the [[hijab]] or follow the other mandates for female behaviour prescribed by extreme fundamentalist Islam.’ 	 

The signing of the [[Washington Agreement]] in March 1994 brought to an end the Bosnian-Croatian conflict. While the &quot;Bosnian Mujahidin&quot; remained to fight on in the war against the Serbs, the [[Dayton Peace Accord]] of November 1995 brought that conflict to an end and required that foreign fighters disband and leave the country, with aid being conditional on this taking place. With Bosnian government support, [[NATO]] forces took effective action to close their bases and deport them. A limited number of former Mujahidin who had either married native Bosnians or who could not be found a country to go to were permitted to stay in Bosnia and granted Bosnian citizenship, but with the war in Bosnia over, many committed battle-hardened veterans had already returned to familiar territory.

===Return to Afghanistan===
After the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for seven years and plagued by constant infighting between the former allies, the various Mujahidin groups and their leaders. 

Throughout the 1990s a new force began to emerge. The origins of the [[Taliban]] (literally &quot;students&quot;) lay in children of Afghanis, many of them orphaned by the war, and many of whom had had been educated in the rapidly expanding network of Islamic schools (madrassas) either in Kandahar or in the refugee camps on the Afghan-Pakistani border.

According to Ahmad Rashid's well-regarded book ''Taliban'', five leaders of the Taliban were graduates of a single madrassa, Darul Uloom Haqqania, Akora Khattak, near Peshawar which is situated in Pakistan but which was largely attended by Afghan refugees. This institution reflected Salafi beliefs in its teachings and much of its funding came from private donations from wealthy Arabs for which bin Laden provided conduit. A further four more leading figures (including the perceived Taliban leader Mullah [[Mohammed Omar]] Mujahed) attended a similarly funded and influenced madrassa in Kandahar, Afghanistan. 

The ties between the Afghan Arabs and Taliban ran deep. Many of the mujahidin who later joined the Taliban fought alongside Afghan warlord Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi's Harkat i Inqilabi grouping at the time of the Russian invasion. This grouping had also enjoyed the loyalty of most Afghan Arab fighters.

The continuing internecine strife between various factions and accompanying lawlessness following the Soviet withdrawal enabled the growing and well-disciplined [[Taliban]] to expand their control over territory in Afghanistan and they came to establish an enclave which it called the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]. In 1994, they captured the regional centre of Kandahar and making rapid territorial gains thereafter, went on to conquer the capital, Kabul, in September 1996.

After Sudan made it clear bin Laden and his group were no longer welcome in that year, Taliban-controlled Afghanistan -- with previously established connections between the groups, a similar outlook on world affairs and largely isolated from American political influence and military power -- provided a perfect location for al Qaeda to headquarter.

Some 200 bin Laden supporters and their families departed Khartoum for Jalalabad by air in 1996. Thereafter al-Qaeda enjoyed the Taliban's protection and a measure of legitimacy as part of their Ministry of Defense, although only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the [[United Arab Emirates]] recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. 

Al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and the Pakistan border regions are alleged to have trained militant Muslims from around the world. Despite the perception of some people, al-Qaeda members are ethnically diverse and are connected by their radical version of Islam.

An ever-expanding network of supporters thus enjoyed a safe haven in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan until the Taliban were defeated by a combination of local forces and US troops in 2001. Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders are still believed to be located in areas where the population is sympathetic to the Taliban in Afghanistan or the border Tribal Areas of Pakistan.

===Start of militant operations against civilians===
On [[February 23]], [[1998]], Osama bin Laden and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] issued a [[fatwa]] under the banner of the '''World Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders''' saying that &quot;to kill Americans and their allies, civilians, and military is an individual duty of every Muslim who is able.&quot; Although neither man possessed the Islamic credentials, education or stature to issue a fatwa of any kind, this seems to have been overlooked in the enthusiasm of the moment. This was also the year of the first major attack reliably attributed to al-Qaeda, the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings|embassy bombings]] in [[East Africa]], which resulted in upward of 300 deaths. In 1999, Egyptian Islamic Jihad officially merged with al-Qaeda, and al-Zawahiri became bin Laden's closest confidant.

===September 11 attacks===
[[Image:WTC attack 9-11.jpg|thumb|left|United Airlines Flight 175 crashing into the South World Trade Center Tower]]
Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] attributed by authorities to al-Qaeda, the United States began to build up military forces in preparation for an attack on Afghanistan (whose government harboured bin Laden's organization) in response. In the weeks before the United States invaded, the Taliban twice offered to turn over bin Laden to a neutral country for trial if the United States would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks. The Americans, however, refused, and soon thereafter [[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan|invaded Afghanistan]] and, together with the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]], deposed the [[Taliban]] government. 

As a result of this invasion, Taliban training camps were destroyed and much of the alleged existing operating structure of al-Qaeda was disrupted, although strong resistance has remained in Afghanistan, and its main leaders, including Bin Laden, have not been caught. The American government now claims that two-thirds of the top leaders of al-Qaeda in 2001 are currently in custody (including [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], [[Abu Zubaydah]], [[Saif al Islam el Masry]], and [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]]) or dead (including [[Mohammed Atef]]), though it warns the organization is not yet defeated and battles between the United States forces, the Taliban and al-Qaeda continue.

===Activity in Iraq===
[[Image:Zarqawi001.jpg|frame|right| Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi]]

{{See also|Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda}}
Osama bin Laden first took interest in [[Iraq]] when that country invaded [[Kuwait]] in 1990 (giving rise to concerns that the secular, [[socialist]] [[Baathist]] government of Iraq might next set its sights on [[Saudi Arabia]], homeland of bin Laden and of Islam itself). In a letter sent to [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]], he offered to send an army of mujahideen to defend Saudi Arabia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Who is Osama Bin Laden? | work=BBC.com | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1551100.stm | accessdate=July 20 | accessyear=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the [[Gulf War]], the organization's interests became split between outrage with the intervention of the United Nations in the region and hatred of [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein's]] [[secular]] government, as well as expression of concern for the suffering that Islamic people in Iraq were undergoing. 

Bin Laden referred to Saddam Hussein (and the Baathists) as evil, a demon or devil worshipper in his speeches and recorded/written announcements, calling for his overthrow by the people of Iraq. In spite of the distrust Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein had for each other, published reports documented a number of alleged contacts between their organizations.  Official investigations by the [[NSA]], [[CIA]], [[DIA]], [[FBI]], the [[US Department of State|State Department]], the [[9/11 Commission]], and the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] -- have led most analysts to conclude that there is no evidence of a cooperative relationship between them.  (See [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda]]).

During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], al-Qaeda took more formal interest in the region and is known to have been responsible for actively organizing and aiding local resistance to the occupying coalition forces and the emerging democracy. During Iraq's elections in January 2005 al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for nine suicide blasts in the Iraqi capital [[Baghdad]].

[[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], founder of [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad]] and alleged ally of al-Qaeda, formally merged with al-Qaeda on [[17th October]] [[2004]]. The organization started to use the banners of &quot;[[Al-Qaeda in Iraq|al-Qaeda in the Land Between the Two Rivers]]&quot;, instead of old [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad]] banners. In the merger al-Zarqawi declared loyalty to [[Osama bin Laden]].

===Harmony Papers===
Documents seized from al-Qaeda were recently declassified from the Harmony database and became the subject of a published study from West Point titled ''Harmony and Disharmony: Exploiting al-Qa’ida’s Organizational Vulnerabilities.'' [http://www.ctc.usma.edu/aq/Harmony%20and%20Disharmony%20--%20CTC.pdf] The papers give an interesting look into the history of the movement, organizational structure, tensions among leadership and the lessons learned. 

One al-Qaeda writer concluded that one of the lessons learned is the influence of secular Baathist thinking distorts the message of jihad.  This writer advises the movement not to allow the jihad message to be influenced by the Iraqi Baath message. (Page 79) [http://www.ctc.usma.edu/aq/Harmony%20and%20Disharmony%20--%20CTC.pdf]

==Incidents attributed by some to al-Qaeda==
''Note: al-Qaeda does not take credit for most of the following actions, resulting in ambiguity over how many attacks the group has actually conducted.  Following the U.S. declaration of the [[War on Terrorism]] in 2001, the U.S. government has striven to highlight any connections between other terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.  Some prefer to attribute to [[al-Qaedaism]] actions that might not be directly planned by al-Qaeda as a military headquarter, but which are inspired by its tenets and strategies.'' 

[[Image:TerroristAttacksAlQaeda.png|thumb|right|500px|World Map of attacks attributed to al-Qaeda]]

The first militant attack that al-Qaeda allegedly carried out consisted of three bombings at hotels where American troops were staying in [[Aden]], [[Yemen]], on [[December 29]], 1992. A Yemeni and an [[Austria]]n tourist died in one bombing.

There are disputed claims that al-Qaeda operatives assisted in the shooting down of U.S. [[helicopter]]s and the killing of U.S. servicemen in [[Somalia]] in 1993. (see: [[Battle of Mogadishu]])

[[Ramzi Yousef]], who was involved in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing (though probably not an al-Qaeda member at the time), and [[Khalid Sheik Mohammed]] planned [[Operation Bojinka]], a plot to destroy airplanes in mid-Pacific flight using explosives. An apartment fire in [[Manila, Philippines]] exposed the plan before it could be carried out. Youssef was arrested, but Mohammed evaded capture until 2003.

Al-Qaeda is often listed as a suspect in two bombings in [[Saudi Arabia]] in 1995 and 1996: the bombing at a U.S. military facility in [[Riyadh]] in [[November]] [[1995]], which killed two people from [[India]] and five Americans, and the June 1996 [[Khobar Towers bombing]], which killed American military personnel in [[Dhahran, Saudi Arabia|Dhahran]]. However, these attacks are usually ascribed to [[Hizbullah]].

Al-Qaeda is believed to have conducted the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings|bombings]] in August 1998 of the U.S. embassies in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], and [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]], killing more than 200 people and injuring more than 5,000 others.

In [[December]] [[1999]] and into 2000, al-Qaeda [[2000 millennium attack plots|planned attacks]] against U.S. and [[Israel]]i tourists visiting [[Jordan]] for millennial celebrations; however, [[Jordan]]ian authorities thwarted the planned attacks and put 28 suspects on trial. Part of this plot included the planned bombing of the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], but this plot was foiled when bomber [[Ahmed Ressam]] was caught at the US-[[Canada|Canadian]] border with explosives in the trunk of his car. Al-Qaeda also planned to attack the [[USS The Sullivans (DDG-68)|USS ''The Sullivans'']] on [[January 3]], [[2000]], but the effort failed due to too much weight being put on the small boat meant to bomb the ship.

Despite the setback with the USS ''The Sullivans'', al-Qaeda succeeded in bombing a U.S. warship in October 2000 with the [[USS Cole bombing]]. [[Germany|German]] police foiled a plot to destroy a [[Notre-Dame de Strasbourg|cathedral]] in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]] in [[December]] [[2000]]. See: [[Strasbourg cathedral bombing plot]]

The most destructive act ascribed to al-Qaeda was the series of attacks in the USA on [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th, 2001]].

Several attacks and attempted attacks since [[September 11]], [[2001]] have been attributed to al-Qaeda. The first of which was the [[Paris embassy attack plot]], which was foiled.
The second of which involved the attempted shoe bomber [[Richard Reid (terrorist)|Richard Reid]], who proclaimed himself a follower of Osama bin Laden, and got close to destroying [[American Airlines]] [[American Airlines Flight 63|Flight 63]].

Other attacks ascribed to al-Qaeda and its affiliates:
*The [[Singapore embassies attack plot]].
*The [[kidnap]]ping and [[murder]] of [[Wall Street Journal]] reporter [[Daniel Pearl]], and numerous bombings in Pakistan.
*The [[El Ghriba synagogue|El Ghriba]] [[Ghriba Synagogue Attack|synagogue bombing]] in [[Djerba]], [[Tunisia]], which killed 21.
*Foiled attacks on Western warships in the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].
*The [[Limburg tanker bombing]].
*A [[November]] [[2002]] [[Kenyan hotel bombing|car bombing]] in [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]], and an attempt to shoot down an Israeli airliner.
*[[Riyadh Compound Bombings|Bombings of Western compounds]] in Riyadh in May 2003 and other attacks of the [[Insurgency in Saudi Arabia|Saudi insurgency]].
*The [[Istanbul Bombings]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], in 2003.

Al-Qaeda has strong alliances with a number of other Islamic militant organizations including the Indonesian Islamic extremist group [[Jemaah Islamiyah]]. That group was responsible for the [[October]] [[2002]] [[Bali bombing]], and the [[2005 Bali bombings]].

Although there have been no identified al-Qaeda attacks within the territory of the United States since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], numerous al-Qaeda attacks in the Middle East, Far East, Africa and Europe have caused extensive casualties and turmoil.  In the aftermath of several [[March 11]], [[2004]] [[March 11, 2004 Madrid attacks|attacks on commuter trains in Madrid]], a [[London]] newspaper reported receiving an email from a group affiliated with al-Qaeda, claiming responsibility and a videotape claiming responsibility was also found. The timing of the attacks with the spanish elections, as well as the lack of proof on the real identity of the perpetrators has shed doubt on the al-Qaeda theory behind these attacks.

It is also believed that al-Qaeda was involved in the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], a series of attacks against mass transit in London which killed 56 people (see [[Mohammad Sidique Khan]]).A statement from a previously unknown group, &quot;The Secret Organization of al-Qaeda in Europe&quot;, claimed responsibility; however, the authenticity of the statement and the group's connection to al-Qaeda has not been independently verified.  The suspected perpetrators have not been definitively linked to al-Qaeda, although the contents of a video tape made by one of the bombers [[Mohammad Sidique Khan]] prior to his death and subsequently sent to [[Al Jazeera]] gives strong credence to an al-Qaeda connection.  An apparently unconnected group attempted to duplicate the attack later that month, but their bombs failed to detonate.

Al-Qaeda is suspected of being involved with the [[2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks]] in Egypt. On [[July 23]], [[2005]], a series of suspected car bombs killed about 90 people and wounded over 150. The attack was the deadliest terrorist action in the history of [[Egypt]].

Al-Qaeda is also suspected in the [[November 9]], [[2005]] [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] attacks in which [[2005 Amman bombings|three simultaneous bombings]] occured at [[United States|American]] owned hotels in Amman. The blast killed at least 57 people and injured 120 people. Most of the injured and killed were attending a wedding at the [[Radisson]] Hotel.

==The chain of command==
Though the current structure of al-Qaeda is unknown, information mostly acquired from the defector [[Jamal al-Fadl]] provided American authorities with a rough picture of how the group was organized. While the veracity of the information provided by al-Fadl and the motivation for his cooperation are both disputed, American authorities base much of their current knowledge of al-Qaeda on his testimony.

Bin Laden is the '''[[emir]]''' of al-Qaeda (although originally this role may have been filled by [[Abu Ayoub al-Iraqi]]), advised by a '''shura council''', which consists of senior al-Qaeda members, estimated by Western officials at about twenty to thirty people.

* The '''Military committee''' is responsible for training, weapons acquisition, and planning attacks.
* The '''Money/Business committee''' runs business operations. The travel office provides air tickets and false [[passport]]s. The payroll office pays al-Qaeda members, and the Management office oversees money-making businesses. In the US 911 Commission Report it is estimated that al-Qaeda requires 30,000,000 USD / year to conduct its operation.
* The '''Law committee''' reviews Islamic law and decides if particular courses of action conform to the law.
* The '''Islamic study/fatwah committee''' issues religious edicts, such as an edict in 1998 telling Muslims to kill Americans.
* In the late 1990s there was a publicly known '''Media committee''', which ran the now-defunct newspaper ''Nashrat al Akhbar (Newscast)'' and did [[public relations]]. It is currently assumed that media operations are now outsourced to internally redundant parts of the organization.

==Political revolt or structured terrorist organization: unknown==
Some organizational specialists have said that Al Qaeda's network structure, as opposed to a [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical structure]] is its primary strength. The decentralized structure enables Al Qaeda to have a worldwide distributed base while retaining a relatively small core. While an estimated 100,000 Islamist militants are said to have received instruction in Al Qaeda camps since its inception, the group is believed to retain only a small number of militants under direct orders. Estimates seldom peg its manpower higher than 20,000 world wide. 

For its most complex operations (such as the 9/11 attacks on the US) all participants, planning and funding are believed to have been directly provided by the core Al Qaeda organisation. But in many attacks around the world where there appears to be an Al Qaeda connection, its precise role has been less easy to define. Rather than handling these operations from conception to delivery, Al Qaeda often appears to act as an international financial and logistical support-network, channelling income obtained from a network of fundraising activities to provide training capital and coordination for local radical groups. In many cases it is these local groups, only loosely affiliated to core Al Qaeda, which actually undertake the attacks. 

The [[2002 Bali bombing]] and subsequent bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta in 2003 provide some insight into Al Qaeda's decentralized method of operations: the attacks showed far greater coordination and effectiveness than might historically have been expected from regional terrorist networks. But police investigations and subsequent trials showed that while Al Qaeda was believed to have provided expertise and coordination, much of the planning and all the personnel who undertook the attacks came from local radical Islamist groups. 

Al Qaeda has been known to establish and foster new groups to further the radical Islamic interest in local conflicts. Indeed the Taliban might be deemed to fall into this category, the roots of the organisation formed from radicalised students from the Bin-Laden funded medressas of the Afghan refugee camps at the time of the Russian occupation.

==Is al-Qaeda a global network or a small organization?==
Al-Qaeda has no clear structure, and this permits debate as to how many members make up the organization, whether it is millions scattered across the globe, or whether it is even zero. According to the controversial [[BBC]] documentary ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', al-Qaeda is so weakly linked together that it is hard to say it exists ''apart from'' [[Osama bin Laden]] and a small clique of close associates. The lack of any significant numbers of convicted al-Qaeda members despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges is cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a ''widespread'' entity that meets the description of al-Qaeda exists at all. Still, the extent and nature of al-Qaeda remains a topic of dispute.

The al-Qaeda name itself does not seem to have been used by bin Laden himself to apply to his organization until after the [[September 11 attacks]]. Previous attacks attributed to bin Laden and al-Qaeda were, at the time, claimed by organizations under a variety of names. Bin Laden himself has since attributed the al-Qaeda name to the MAK base in Pakistan, dating from the Afghan war days. Daniel Benjamin in &quot;The Age of Sacred Terror&quot; cites an incident in the early 1990s where a document titled &quot;The Foundation&quot;, Arabic &quot;Al-Qa'eda&quot;, was found on an associate of Ramzi Youssef &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The making of the terror myth | work=Guardian Unlimited | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,12780,1327904,00.html | accessdate=October 15 | accessyear=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Fawaz A. Gerges]] writes that &quot;Although in 1987 sheikh [[Abdullah Azzam]], the spiritual father of the Afghan Arabs, planted the seeds of a transnationalist organization called 'Al Qaeda al-Sulbah' (the Solid Foundation), the bin Laden network saw the light much later, around the mid-1990s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Gereges, Fawaz A. | title=The Far Enemy: Why Jihad Went Global | publisher=Oxford: Cambridge University Press | year=2005 | page=306 | id=ISBN 0521791405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sulaiman Abu Ghaith]]
* [[Abu Hafiza]]
* [[Abu Faraj al-Libbi]] (arrested in Pakistan, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Pakistan 'catches al-Qaeda chief' | work=BBC.com | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4512885.stm | accessdate=May 4 | accessyear=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet activities==
In the wake of its evacuation from Afghanistan, al-Qaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance.  As a result, the organization’s use of the Internet has grown more sophisticated, encompassing financing, recruitment, networking, mobilization, publicity, as well as information dissemination, gathering, and sharing.  More than other terrorist organizations, al-Qaeda has embraced the Web for these purposes.  For example, [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]’s al-Qaeda movement in [[Iraq]] regularly releases short videos glorifying the activity of jihadist suicide bombers.  This growing range of multimedia content includes terrorist training clips, stills of victims about to be murdered, testimonials of suicide bombers, and epic-themed videos with high production values that romanticize participation in jihad through stylized portraits of mosques and stirring musical scores.  A website associated with al-Qaeda, for example, posted a video of a man named [[Nick Berg]] being decapitated in Iraq. Other decapitation videos and pictures, including those of [[Paul Johnson (hostage)|Paul Johnson]], [[Kim Sun-il]], and [[Daniel Pearl]], were first posted onto jihadist websites.

With the rise of “locally rooted, globally inspired” terrorists, counterterrorism experts are currently studying how al-Qaeda is using the Internet – through websites, chat rooms, discussion forums, instant messaging, and so on – to inspire a worldwide network of support.  The July 7, 2005 bombers, some of whom were well integrated into their local communities, are an example of such “globally inspired” terrorists, and they reportedly used the Internet to plan and coordinate, but the Internet’s precise role in the process of radicalization is not thoroughly understood.  A group called the Secret Organization of al-Qaeda in Europe has claimed responsibility for these London attacks on a militant Islamist website – another popular use of the Internet by terrorists seeking publicity.  

The publicity opportunities offered by the Internet have been particularly exploited by al-Qaeda.  In December 2004, for example, bin Laden released an audio message by posting it directly to a website, rather than sending a copy to [[al Jazeera]] as he had done in the past.  Some analysts speculated that he did this to be certain it would be available unedited, out of fear that his criticism of Saudi Arabia — which was much more vehement than usual in this speech, lasting over an hour — might be edited out by al Jazeera editors worried about offending the touchy [[Saudi royal family]].

In the past, [[Alneda.com]] and [[Jehad.net]] were perhaps the most significant of al-Qaeda websites. Alneda was initially taken down by an American, but the operators resisted by shifting the site to various servers and strategically changing content.  The US is currently attempting to extradite an IT specialist, Babar Ahmad, from the UK, who is the creator of various English language al-Qaeda websites such as Azzam.com &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Whitlock, Craig| year=2005| title=Briton Used Internet As His Bully Pulpit | format=http | work=WashingtonPost.com | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/07/AR2005080700890.html | accessdate=January 20 | accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Babar Ahmad Indicted on Terrorism Charges | work=United States Attorney's Office District of Connecticut | url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/Press2004/20041006.html | accessdate=October 6 | accessyear=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ahmad's extradition is opposed by various British Muslim organizations, such the [[Muslim Association of Britain]].

Finally, at a mid-2005 presentation for US government terrorism analysts, Dennis Pluchinsky called the global jihadist movement “Web-directed,” and former CIA deputy director John E. McLaughlin has also said it is now primarily driven today by “ideology and the Internet.”

== Financial activities ==
Financial activities of Al-Qaeda have been a major preoccupation of US government following the September 11, 2001 attacks, leading for example to the discovery of former Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s tax evasion, for which his wife, [[Lucía Hiriart de Pinochet]], has been arrested in January 2006. It was also discovered by investigative reporter [[Denis Robert]] that funds from Osama Ben Laden's [[Bahrain International Bank]] transited through illegal unpublished accounts of &quot;clearing house&quot; [[Clearstream]], which has been qualified as a &quot;bank of banks&quot;.

==Notes on naming==
Al-Qaeda's name can also be [[transliteration|transliterated]] as al-Qaida, al-Qa'ida, el-Qaida, or al Qaeda. In Arabic it is spelled القاعدة. Its [[Arabic language|Arabic]] pronunciation ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/ɛlˈqɑːʕidʌ/}}) can be approximated as IPA {{IPA|/ɛl 'kɑ:-idʌ/}}, which for [[American English]] speakers could be spelled &quot;el-kAW-ee-deh,&quot; with the emphasized &quot;AW&quot; and &quot;ee&quot; clearly separated. However, English speakers more commonly pronounce it in a manner influenced by its spelling - IPA {{IPA|/ɑɫ 'kaɪdɑ/}} for [[American English]], {{IPA|/ɑ:ɫ 'kaɪdɑ:/}} in [[British English]]. [http://ibb7.ibb.gov/pronunciations/sounds/2930.ra Listen to the US pronunciation] ([[RealPlayer]]).

Al-Qaeda has other names, such as:
* International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders
* [[Islam]]ic [[Army]]
* Islamic Army for the Liberation of the [[Holy]] Places
* Osama bin Laden Network
* Osama bin Laden Organization
* [[Islam]]ic [[Salvation]] Foundation

'''Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta''' ([[February 18]], [[1745]] - [[March 5]], [[1827]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Physics|physicist]] known especially for the development of the [[battery (electricity)|electric battery]] in 1800.  Late in life, he received the title of [[Count]]. 

==Biography==
Volta was born and educated in [[Como]], [[Lombardy]] ([[Italy]]), where he became [[professor]] of [[physics]] at the Royal School in [[1774]]. His passion had always been the study of electricity, and still a young student he had even written a poem in [[Latin]] on this fascinating new discovery. ''De vi attractiva ignis electrici ac phaenomenis inde pendentibus'' is his first scientific paper. 

[[Image:Alevoltafoto02.jpg|143px|thumb|left|De vi attractiva ...]]

In [[1775]] he devised the [[electrophorus]], a device that produced a static electric charge. In [[1776]]-[[1777|77]] he studied the [[chemistry]] of [[gas]]es, discovered [[methane]], and devised experiments such as the [[ignition]] of gases by an electric [[spark]] in a closed vessel. In [[1779]] he became professor of physics at the University of [[Pavia]], a chair he occupied for 25 years. In [[1794]] Volta married Teresa Peregrini, daughter of Count Ludovico Peregrini; the couple had three sons. 

In [[1800]], as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by [[Luigi Galvani]], he developed the so-called [[voltaic pile]], a forerunner of the electric battery, which produced a steady electric current. Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was [[zinc]] and [[silver]]. Initially he experimented with individual cells in series, each cell being a wine goblet filled with brine into which the two dissimilar electrodes were dipped. The electric pile replaced the goblets with cardboard soaked in brine. (The number of cells, and thus the voltage it could produce, was limited by the pressure, exerted by the upper cells, that would squeeze all of the brine out of the cardboard of the bottom cell.)

==Honors==
In honor of his work in the field of [[electricity]], [[Napoleon]] made him a [[count]] in [[1810]]; in [[1815]] the [[Emperor]] of [[Austria]] named him a professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Padova]]. 

Volta is buried in the city of [[Como]] in [[Italy]]; the '''Tempio Voltiano''' near [[Lake Como]] is a museum devoted to explaining his work; his original instruments and papers are on display there.  The building appeared, along with his portrait, on Italian 10.000 [[Italian lira|lira]] banknote, before the introduction of the [[euro]].

In [[1881]] an important electrical [[SI derived unit|unit]], the [[volt]], was named in his honor.  [[Volta (crater)|Volta crater]], on the [[Moon]], is also named after him.

Toyota Motor Corp has created a concept vehicle with the name [[Toyota Alessandro Volta|Alessandro Volta]].

'''Argo Navis''' (or simply '''Argo''') was a large southern [[constellation]] representing the ''[[Argo]]'', the ship used by [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in [[Greek mythology]].  The abbreviation was &quot;Arg&quot; and the genitive was &quot;Argūs&quot;.

It is the only one of [[Ptolemy]]'s list of 48 constellations that is no longer officially recognised as a constellation, having been broken up by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] into [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] (the keel of the ship), [[Puppis]] (the poop) and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] (the sails). Were it still considered a single constellation, it would be the largest of all, being larger than [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]].

When Argo Navis was split, its [[Bayer designation]]s were also split. Carina has the &amp;alpha; and &amp;beta;, Vela has &amp;gamma; and &amp;delta;, Carina has &amp;epsilon;, Puppis has &amp;zeta;, and so on.

The constellation [[Pyxis]] (the compass) occupies an area which in antiquity was considered part of Argo's mast. But Pyxis is not usually considered part of Argo Navis, and in particular its Bayer designations are separate from those of Carina, Puppis and Vela.

:''See [[Andromeda (disambiguation)]] for other uses of &quot;Andromeda&quot;.''

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Andromeda''' (&quot;ruler of men&quot;) was the daughter of [[Cepheus]] and [[Boast of Cassiopeia|Cassiopeia]], king and queen of the [[Ethiopia|Ethiopians]].
[[Image:Paul_Gustave_Dore_Andromeda.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Doré|Paul Gustave Doré]] painted Andromeda exposed to the sea-monster.]]

Cassiopeia, having boasted herself equal in beauty to the [[Nereids]], drew down the vengeance of [[Poseidon]], who sent an inundation on the land and a sea-monster, which destroyed man and beast. The [[oracle]] of [[Ammon]] announced that no relief would be found until the king exposed his daughter Andromeda to the monster, so she was fastened to a rock on the shore.

[[Perseus (mythology)|Perseus]], returning from having slain the [[Gorgon]], found Andromeda, slew the monster, set her free, and married her in spite of [[Phineus]], to whom she had before been promised. At the wedding a quarrel took place between the rivals, and Phineus was turned to stone by the sight of the Gorgon's head ([[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' v. 1).

Andromeda followed her husband to [[Tiryns]] in [[Argos]], and became the ancestress of the family of the [[Perseidae]] through Perseus' and Andromeda's son, [[Perses]].  Perseus and Andromeda had six sons ([[Perseides]]): [[Perses]], [[Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus]], and [[Electryon]], and one daughter, [[Gorgophone]].  Their descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] down to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] got the kingdom, and include the great hero [[Heracles]]. According to this mythology, Perses is the ancestor of the [[Persians]].

After her death she was placed by [[Athena]] amongst the [[constellation|constellations]] in the northern sky, near Perseus and Cassiopeia. [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] (and in more modern times [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]]) made the story the subject of tragedies.  The tale is represented in numerous ancient works of art.

Andromeda is represented in the northern sky by the [[constellation]] [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] which contains the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].

This event was depicted in a modified version in the [[1981]] [[Film|movie]] ''[[Clash of the Titans]]''.

The [[constellation]] '''Antlia''' ([[Latin]] for ''[[pump]]'') is a relatively new constellation as it was only created in the [[18th century]], being too faint to be acknowledged by the ancient Greeks. The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] adopted it as one of the 88 modern constellations. Beginning at the north, Antlia is surrounded by the sea snake [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], the compass [[Pyxis]], the sails ([[Vela (constellation)|Vela]]) of the mythological ship [[Argo]] and finally the centaur [[Centaurus]].

==Notable features==

Antlia is a faint constellation void of bright stars. Its least faint star is:
*[[Alpha Antliae|&amp;alpha; Ant]]: being Antlia's principal star its apparent brightness is still only 4.25 mag. Its spectral class is K4&amp;nbsp;III

==Notable deep sky objects==

*[[NGC 2997]]: [[Spiral galaxy]] of type Sc which is inclined 45° to our line of sight.
*[[NGC 3132]]: This [[planetary nebula]] is also called ''Eight Burst Nebula'' or ''Southern Ring Nebula''. At its heart is a binary system.
*[[PGC 29194]]: This [[dwarf spheroidal galaxy]] with an apparent brightness of only 14.8m belongs to our [[Local Group]] of galaxies. It was only discovered as recently as [[1997]].[http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap970423.html]

==History==

The French astronomer Abbé [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] created 13 constellations for the southern sky to fill some star poor regions, among them Antlia. It was originally denominated ''Antlia pneumatica'' (Latin for the [[air pump]] invented by [[Robert Boyle]]) which is why in English this constellation is also often called Air Pump.

It is interesting to note that no attempt seems to have been made to assign [[Bayer designation|Bayer letters]] according to their apparent brightness.

There is no mythology attached to Antlia as Lacaille discontinued the tradition of giving names from mythology to constellations and instead chose mostly names of instruments used in science.
