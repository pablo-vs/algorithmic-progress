'''Antoni Gaudí i Cornet''' ([[25 June]] [[1852]] – [[10 June]] [[1926]]) was a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[architecture|architect]] famous for his unique style and highly individualistic designs.

==Gaudí's Life==
===Birth and childhood=== &lt;font color=FF3399&gt; &amp;hearts; elh &lt;/font color=FF3399&gt;
Gaudí was born in [[Tarragona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], in [[1852]] though no one knows exactly where. While many believe his birthplace to be the town of [[Reus]], others claim it was in fact [[Riudoms]].{{ref|birth}} It is known, however, that he was [[baptism|baptized]] in Reus a day after his birth. The artist's parents, Francesc Gaudí Serra and Antonia Cornet Bertran, both came from families of metalsmiths.

Gaudí, the youngest of five, found himself unable to play with friends his age because of [[rheumatism]]. Being in such pain, he was rarely able to walk on foot and was forced to ride a donkey when he wanted to go anywhere outside his home. That he remained close to home allowed him substantial free time to observe [[nature]] and its design.{{ref|rheumatism}} It has been hypothesized that it was this exposure to nature at an early age that began to hone two of his greatest qualities: observation and the analysis of nature.{{ref|observe-nature}}

===Early education===
At a young age, Gaudí entered a [[nursery school]] (''parvulari'') under the instruction of Francesc Berenguer, and his imaginative qualities began to manifest themselves: when Berenguer lectured the child on how wings let birds fly, Gaudí observed that chickens do not fly. He concluded that their wings must help them run faster.{{ref|chickens}}

When the time came for his formal education, Gaudí enrolled in the Collegi de les Escoles Píes de Reus, where he soon became fast friends with Eduard Toda and Josep Ribera. It was perhaps their insatiable curiosity that drove them to learn all they could about the intricacies of nature.{{ref|school-1}}

During his time at Les Escoles, Gaudí did not make the best of grades, though he proved to be an abstract thinker. He did, however, see remarkable improvement in the area of [[geometry]], a subject which fascinated him. This fascination would carry through with him until his death. Its first major effect on his life was his choice of career.

===Higher education===
As an [[architecture]] student at the Escola Tècnica Superior d'Arquitectura in [[Barcelona]] from [[1873]] to [[1877]], Gaudí continued to achieve mediocre grades but did well in the &quot;Trial drawings and Projects&quot; course.  {{ref|arch-grades}}

He would remain affiliated with the Escola Tècnica Superior d'Arquitectura his entire life. Awarded the title of Architect by the school in [[1878]], Gaudí immediately began to plan and design. When Elies Rogent signed the title, he declared, &quot;I have either found a lunatic or a genius.&quot;{{ref|lunatic}}

===Interests===
Gaudí, throughout his life, was fascinated by nature. He studied nature's angles and curves and incorporated them into his designs. Instead of relying on geometric shapes, he mimicked the way trees and humans grow and stand upright. The [[hyperboloid|hyperboloids]]  and [[paraboloid|paraboloids]] he borrowed from nature were easily reinforced by steel rods. He didn't limit his use of natural structures to support, however, and most of his designs resemble elements from the environment.

Because of his rheumatism, the artist observed a strict vegetarian diet, used [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] drug therapy, underwent water therapy, and hiked regularly. Long walks, besides suppressing his rheumatism, further allowed him to experience nature.
&lt;!-- 
To be finished before published: 
===Early career===
The first of Gaudí's major successes was, ironically, a failure in the his eyes. He was commissioned to design and build housing for the workers of La Cooperativa Mataronense, a factory in Barcelona. Although he only completed a single section of the factory, along with a kiosk, his work was recognized at the World Fair in Paris, giving him a name in the architecture world. It was at the World Fair that he first met Eusebi Güell.{{ref|met-Guell}}

===Later years===
[[Image:Casamila.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Casa Milà]], in the [[Eixample]], [[Barcelona]].]]

Gaudí was an ardent Catholic and a fervent [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]]. (He was once arrested for speaking in Catalan in a situation deemed illegal by authorities.) In his later years, he abandoned secular work and devoted his life to Catholicism and his ''[[Sagrada Família]]''. In the early twentieth century, Gaudí's closest family and friends began to die; his works slowed to a halt; and his attitude changed. Perhaps one of his closest family members – his niece Rosa Egea – passed away in [[1912]], only to be followed by a &quot;faithful collaborator, Francesc Berenguer Mestres&quot; two years later. After both tragedies, Barcelona fell on hard times, economically. The construction of ''La Sagrada Família'' slowed; the construction of ''La Colonia Güell'' ceased altogether. Four years later, Eusebi Güell died.{{ref|slowdown}} 

Perhaps it was because of this unfortunate sequence of events that Gaudí changed. He became reluctant to talk with reporters or have his picture taken and solely concentrated on his masterpiece, ''La Sagrada Familia''.{{ref|focus-sagrada}}

On [[June 7]] [[1926]], Antoni Gaudí was run over by a [[tram]]. Because of his ragged attire and empty pockets, multiple cab drivers refused to pick him up for fear that he would be unable to pay the fare. He was eventually taken to a pauper's hospital in Barcelona. Nobody recognized the injured Gaudí until some friends found him at the poor hospital the next day. When they tried to move him into a nicer hospital, Gaudí refused, reportedly saying &quot;I belong here among the ghetto.&quot; He died two days later, half of Barcelona mourning his death. It was, perhaps, fitting that he was buried in the midst of his unfinished masterpiece, ''La Sagrada Família''.{{ref|death}}

==Artistic style==
[[Image:Sagradafamilia-overview.jpg|thumb|right|Gaudí's unfinished masterpiece, ''[[La Sagrada Familia|Sagrada Família]]'']]

Gaudí's first works were designed in the style of [[gothic architecture|gothic]] and traditional Catalan architectural modes, but he soon developed his own distinct sculptural style. French architect [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]], who promoted an evolved form of gothic architecture, proved a major influence on Gaudí. But the student surpassed the master architect and contrived highly original designs – irregular and fantastically intricate. Some of his greatest works, most notably ''La Sagrada Família'', have an almost hallucinatory power.

He integrated the [[parabolic arch]], nature's organic shapes, and the fluidity of water into his architecture. While designing buildings, he observed the forces of [[gravity]] and related [[catenary]] principles. (He designed many of his arches upside down by hanging various weights on interconnected strings, using gravity to calculate catenaries for a natural curved arch.) Using the Catalan ''[[trencadís]]'' technique, Gaudí often decorated surfaces with broken tiles.

The architect's work has been categorized as [[Art Nouveau]] architecture, a precursor to [[modern architecture]]. But his adoption of biomorphic shapes rather than orthogonal lines put him in a category unto himself (in Latin, ''[[sui generis]]''). His style was later echoed by that of Austrian architect [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]] (1928&amp;ndash;2000).

Though hailed as a genius, some hypothesize that Gaudí was [[color blindness|color blind]] and that it was only in collaboration with [[Josep Maria Jujol]] – an architect twenty seven years his junior whom he acknowledged as a genius in his own right – that he produced his greatest works.

==Popularity==
Gaudí's originality was at first ridiculed by his peers. Indeed, he was first only supported by the rich industrialist [[Eusebi Güell]]. His fellow citizens referred to the ''Casa Milà'' as ''La Pedrera'' (&quot;the quarry&quot;), and [[George Orwell]], who stayed at Barcelona during the [[Spanish Civil War]], admittedly loathed his work. As time passed, though, his work became more famous, up to the point that he is now considered one of [[List of Catalan people|Catalonia's best and brightest]].

==Social and political influences==
The opportunities afforded by Catalonia's socioeconomic and political environments were endless. Catalonians such as Antonio Gaudí often showcased the region's diverse art techniques in their works. By mimicking nature, such artists symbolically pushed back the province's ever-increasing industrial society. Gaudí, among others, promoted the Catalan nationalist movement by incorporating elements of Catalan culture in his designs.

==Major works==
[[Image:Parcguell.jpg|thumb|right|View of the [[Park Guell|Park Güell]], [[El Carmel]], [[Barcelona]].]]

* ''[[Casa Vicens]]'' (1878-1880)
* ''[[Palau Güell]]'' (1885-1889)
* ''[[College of the Teresianas]]'' (1888-1890)
* ''Crypt of the [[Church of Colònia Güell]]'' (1898-1916)
* ''[[Casa Calvet|Casa Calvet]]'' (1899-1904)
* ''[[Casa Batlló]]'' (1905-1907)
* ''[[Casa Milà]]'' (''La Pedrera'') (1905-1907)
* ''[[Park Guell|Park Güell]]'' (1900-1914)
* ''[[Sagrada Familia|Sagrada Família]]'' (1884-1926)

Many of these works can be found in the [[Eixample]] district of Barcelona. Eight are [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]]  [[World Heritage Sites]]. Park Güell, Palau Güell, and Casa Milà have been heritage sites since 1984. The other five &amp;ndash; the façade of the Nativity, the crypt of ''La Sagrada Família'', ''La Casa Vicens'', ''La Casa Batlló'' and the crypt of the Church of Colònia Güell &amp;ndash; became so labeled by UNESCO in 2005.

==Influence==
*Gaudí's abandoned plans for a [[New York]] [[skyscraper]] [[hotel]] influenced the redesign of the [[World Trade Center]] after [[September 11, 2001]].

*In [[1992]], five artists founded La Asociación pro Beatificación de Antonio Gaudí. The secular association has since pushed for the [[Catholic church]] to [[beatification|declare Gaudí blessed]].{{ref|beatify}}

*Gaudí's life and work inspired [[The Alan Parsons Project]] to create the [[1987]] album ''[[Gaudi (album)|Gaudí]]''.

*Gaudi's work recently inspired a shop owner in [[Muswell Hill]] London to build a shopfront in the style of [[Casa Batlló]].

[[Image:Gray1184.png|thumb|300px|[[Gray's Anatomy|Gray's]] Fig. 1184 – Suprarenal glands viewed from behind.]]
In [[mammal]]s, the '''adrenal glands''' (also known as '''suprarenal glands''' or colloquially as '''kidney hats''') are the triangle-shaped [[endocrine gland]]s that sit atop the [[kidney]]s; their name indicates that position (''ad'', &quot;near&quot; or &quot;at&quot; + ''renes'', &quot;kidneys&quot;). They are chiefly responsible for regulating the [[stress (medicine)|stress]] response through the [[synthesis]] of [[corticosteroid]]s and [[catecholamine]]s, including [[cortisol]] and [[adrenaline]].

== Overview ==
[[Image:Kidney_section.jpg|thumb|200px|Above each human kidney is one of the two [[adrenal gland]]s.]]
[[Image:Adrenal_cortex_layers.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Layers of the adrenal cortex]]
Anatomically, the adrenal glands are located in the abdomen, situated on the anteriosuperior aspect of the kidneys. In humans, the adrenal glands are found at the level of the 12th [[thoracic vertebra]] and receive their blood supply from the [[adrenal artery|adrenal arteries]].

It is separated into two distinct structures, the [[#Adrenal medulla|adrenal medulla]] and the [[#Adrenal cortex|adrenal cortex]], both of which receive regulatory input from the [[nervous system]]. As its name suggests, the adrenal medulla is at the center of the adrenal gland surrounded by the adrenal cortex.

The ''adrenal medulla'' is the body's main source of the catecholamine hormones [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]]. By contrast, some cells of the ''adrenal cortex'' belong to the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] and are the source of [[cortisol]] synthesis. Other cortical cells produce [[androgen]]s such as [[testosterone]], while some regulate [[water]] and [[electrolyte]] concentrations by secreting [[aldosterone]].

== Adrenal medulla ==
Composed mainly of hormone-producing [[chromaffin cell]]s, the adrenal medulla is the principal site of the conversion of the [[amino acid]] [[tyrosine]] into the catecholamines [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] (also called adrenaline and noradrenaline, respectively). Medullary cells are derived from the [[embryo]]nic [[neural crest]] and, as such, are simply modified [[neuron]]s. In particular, they are modified [[postganglionic cell]]s of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] that have lost their [[axon]]s and [[dendrite]]s, receiving innervation from corresponding [[preganglionic fiber]]s. Moreover, as the synapses between pre- and postganglionic fibers are called ''[[autonomic ganglion|ganglia]]'', the adrenal medulla is actually a ganglion of the sympathetic nervous system.

In response to [[stressor]]s such as [[exercise]] or imminent danger, medullary cells release catecholamines into the blood in a 70:30 ratio of epinephrine to norepinephrine. Notable effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine include increased [[heart rate]], [[vasoconstriction|blood vessel constriction]], [[bronchiole]] dilation, and increased [[metabolism]], all of which are characteristic of the [[fight-or-flight response]].

== Adrenal cortex ==
Situated along the perimeter of the adrenal gland, the adrenal cortex mediates the stress response through the production of [[mineralocorticoid]]s and [[glucocorticoid]]s, including [[aldosterone]] and [[cortisol]] respectively. It is also a secondary site of [[androgen]] synthesis.

The cortex can be divided into three distinct layers of [[biological tissue|tissue]] based on their organization. The most superficial cortical layer is the [[zona glomerulosa]], which produces [[mineralocorticoid]]s (eg, [[aldosterone]]). Beneath the glomerulosa are the [[zona fasciculata|zonae fasciculata]] and [[zona reticularis|reticularis]], which produce [[glucocorticoid]]s (eg, [[cortisol]]) and weak [[androgen]]s (eg, [[dehydroepiandrosterone]]).

All adrenocortical hormones are synthesised from [[cholesterol]]. Cholesterol is transported into the inner mitochondrial membrane by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), where it is converted into [[pregnenolone]] by the enzyme CYP11A. Accordingly, production of hormones in all three layers of the adrenal cortex is limited by the transportation of cholesterol into the mitochondria and by its conversion into pregnenolone. Pregnenolone can be either dehydrogenated to [[progesterone]] or hydroxylated to 17-alpha-hydroxypregnenolone. The steps up to this point occur in many steroid-producing tissues. Subsequent steps, however, only occur in the adrenal cortex.

* Progesterone -&gt;(hydroxylation at C21)-&gt; Deoxycorticosterone -&gt;(two further hydroxylations)-&gt; Aldosterone
* Progesterone -&gt; (hydroxylation at C17)-&gt; 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone -&gt;(hydroxylation)-&gt; Deoxycortisol -&gt;(hydroxylation)-&gt; Cortisol

The layers of the cortex can be remembered with the [[mnemonic]] ''[[glomerular filtration rate|GFR]]'': '''G''' - ''glomerulosa'', '''F''' - ''fasciculata'', '''R''' - ''reticularis''.  Another mnemonic that is used is ''Go Find Rex, Make Good Sex'': '''G''' - ''glomerulosa'', '''F''' - ''fasciculata'', '''R''' - ''reticularis'', '''M''' - ''mineralcorticoids'', '''G''' - ''glucocorticoids'', '''S''' - ''sex hormones''.

===Zona glomerulosa===
The zona glomerulosa is the most superficial layer of the adrenal cortex, lying directly beneath the adrenal gland's capsule. Its cells are arranged in spherical clusters (''glomus'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for &quot;ball&quot;).

In response to increased [[potassium]] levels or decreased blood flow to the kidneys, cells of the zona glomerulosa secrete the mineralocorticoid [[aldosterone]] into the blood as part of the [[renin-angiotensin system]]. Aldosterone regulates the body's concentration of [[electrolyte]]s, primarily [[sodium]] and potassium, by acting on the [[distal convoluted tubule]] of kidney [[nephron]]s to:

* increase sodium reabsorption
* increase potassium [[excretion]]
* increase water reabsorption through [[osmosis]]

===Zona fasciculata===
Cells of the zona fasciculata sit directly beneath the zona glomerulosa and are organized in bundles (or fascicles). The zona chiefly produces glucocorticoids (eg, [[cortisol]]) and a small amount of weak [[androgen]]s (eg, [[dehydroepiandrosterone]]).

Cortical cells responsible for the production of glucocorticoids are the primary effectors of [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH). The [[hypothalamus]] secretes [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] which stimulates the [[anterior pituitary gland]] to release ACTH; another hypothalamic hormone, [[arginine vasopressin]] augments ACTH secretion, with the two together stimulating larger release than ACTH in isolation. ACTH acts on the adrenal cortex to stimulate the release of glucocorticoids. This three-organ endocrine system is commonly called the [[HPA axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]].

The primary glucocorticoid released by the adrenal gland is [[cortisol]]. Upon binding to its target, cortisol enhances [[metabolism]] in several ways:

* stimulating the release of [[amino acid]]s from the body
* stimulating [[lipolysis]], the breakdown of [[fat]]
* stimulating [[gluconeogenesis]], the production of [[glucose]] from newly-released amino acids and [[lipid]]s
* conserving glucose by inhibiting uptake into muscle and [[adipose tissue|fat cells]]

In addition to glucocorticoid production, the fasciculata is a secondary source of androgens such as [[testosterone]], [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT), [[androstenedione]], and [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA). These enhance [[muscle]] mass, stimulate [[cell growth]], and aid in the development of the [[secondary sex characteristic]]s.

===Zona reticularis===
The innermost layer of the adrenal cortex, the zona reticularis sits beneath the zona fasciculata and atop the adrenal medulla. Its cells are arranged in a network of cords (a reticulum) and have the same functions as cells of the zona fasciculata. It is thought that the zona reticularis is the principal source of glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens, with the zona fasciculata activating only after prolonged stimulation.

== Pathology ==
Adrenal cortex:
* [[Hypoadrenalism]] (e.g. due to [[Addison's disease]])
* [[Cushing's syndrome]]
* [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]
* [[Conn's syndrome]]

Adrenal medulla:
* [[Pheochromocytoma]] is a [[catecholamine]]-secreting tumor of the adrenal medulla.

== Blood supply ==

Although variations of the blood supply to the adrenal glands (and indeed the kidneys themselves) are common, there are usually three arteries that supply each adrenal gland: the superior, middle and inferior suprarenal (or adrenal) arteries.

Each (left and right) superior suprarenal artery is a branch of the [[phrenic artery]] on that side of the body. The left and right phrenic arteries supply the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]], and come off the [[aorta]].

The middle suprarenal artery is a branch directly off the aorta, while the inferior suprarenal artery branches from the aorta or the [[renal artery]].

'''Anthropomorphism''', a form of [[personification]] (applying human or animal qualities to inanimate objects) and similar to [[prosopopoeia]] (adopting the persona of another person), is the attribution of [[human]] characteristics and qualities to non-human beings, objects, or natural phenomena.  [[Animal]]s, forces of [[nature]], and unseen or unknown authors of chance are frequent subjects of anthropomorphosis. 

The term comes from two [[Greek language|Greek]] words, άνθρωπος (''anthrōpos''), meaning &quot;human&quot;, and μορφή (''morphē''), meaning &quot;shape&quot; or &quot;form&quot;. The suffix '-ism' originates from the [[morpheme]] '-isma' in the [[Greek language]].
&lt;!--This seems to be a response to something no longer in the article.
  It is suggested that the ''New English Dictionary'' is misled by the 1866 reprint of Paul Bayne on Ephesians when it quotes &quot;anthropomorphist&quot; as 17th century English.  Seventeenth century editions print &quot;anthropomorphits,&quot; ''i.e''. anthropomorphites, in sense (1). The older abstract term is &quot;anthropopathy,&quot; literally &quot;attributing human feelings,&quot; in sense (2).--&gt;
==In religions and mythologies==
In [[religion]] and [[mythology]], &quot;anthropomorphism&quot; refers to the attribution of a human body or of human qualities generally, to a divine being or beings.  Many mythologies are almost entirely concerned with anthropomorphic [[deity|deities]] who express human characteristics such as [[jealousy]], [[hatred]], or [[love]]. The [[family tree of the Greek gods|Greek gods]] such as [[Zeus]] and [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] were often depicted in human form exhibiting both commendable and despicable human traits.

===Biblical literalism===
Numerous different sects throughout history have been called ''anthropomorphites'', including a [[sect]] in [[Egypt]] in the [[4th century]], and a group in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[10th century]]. Such sects were considered [[heretic]]al for their [[biblical literalism]], taking everything written and spoken of God in the [[Bible]] in a literal sense. This included attributing to God a human form, human parts, and human passions. The passage they chiefly referred to was [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:27, listed below in the original [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and in the [[New American Standard Bible]] translation into [[English language|English]]. {{ref label|1728|2|1}}

:&lt;span lang=&quot;he&quot; title=&quot;Hebrew text&quot; dir=&quot;rtl&quot;  style=&quot;font-family: Times New Roman, David, none;&quot; class=&quot;spanHe&quot;&gt;וַיִּבְרָא אֱלֹהִים אֶת-הָאָדָם בְּצַלְמוֹ, בְּצֶלֶם אֱלֹהִים בָּרָא אֹתוֹ:  זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה, בָּרָא אֹתָם.&lt;/span&gt;

:&quot;God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.&quot;

===Hinduism===
The ten [[avatar]]s of the [[Hindu]] supreme God [[Vishnu]] possess both human and divine forms and qualities, although their divinity varies in degree.  In [[Vaishnavism]], a monotheistic faith, Vishnu is [[omniscience|omniscient]] and [[benevolence|benevolent]], unlike gods of the [[Ancient Greek Religion|Greek]] and [[Roman religion|Roman]] religions.  See [[God#Conceptions of God in Hinduism|Conceptions of God in Hinduism]].

===Condemnation===
Numerous religions and philosophies have condemned anthropomorphism for various reasons.  Some [[Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophers]] did not condone, and were explicitly hostile to, their people's mythology.  These philosophers often developed monotheistic views. [[Plato]]'s (427&amp;ndash;347 [[Common Era|BCE]]) [[Demiurge]] (craftsman) in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] (384&amp;ndash;322 BCE) [[Cosmological argument|prime mover]] in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' are examples. The Greek philosopher [[Xenophanes]] (570&amp;ndash;480 BCE) said that &quot;the greatest God&quot; resembles man &quot;neither in form nor in mind.&quot; ([[Clement of Alexandria]], ''Miscellanies'' V xiv 109.1-3). The similarity of these philosophers' concepts of God to that of the [[Bible]]'s facilitated the incorporation of much pre-Christian Greek philosophy into the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Christian [[world view]] by the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]], notably [[Thomas Aquinas]].

From the perspective of believers of a religion where the deity or deities have human characteristics, it may be more accurate to describe the phenomenon as [[theomorphism]], or the giving of divine qualities to humans, instead of anthropomorphism, the giving of human qualities to the divine.  The reason for this being that according to their beliefs, the deity or deities usually existed before humans, and therefore humans were created in the form of the divine, not vice versa.  However, for those who do not subscribe to the beliefs of the religion, the phenomenon can be considered anthropomorphism.

==In rhetoric==

Anthropomorphism in the form of personification consists of creating imaginary persons who are the embodiment of an abstraction such as [[Death (personification)|Death]], Lust or War. See the article on the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] for notable examples.

In classical [[rhetoric]], personification is a [[figure of speech]] (more specifically a [[trope]]) that employs the deliberate use of anthropomorphism, often to make an emotional appeal. In rhetorical theory, a distinction is often drawn between personification (anthropomorphism of inanimate, but real, objects) and figures such as [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophe]], in which an absent people or abstract concepts are addressed.

'''An example of rhetorical personification:'''
:''A tree whose hungry mouth is prest''
:''Against the earth's sweet-flowing breast.'' [[Joyce Kilmer]], ''Trees''

'''An example of rhetorical apostrophe:'''
:''O eloquent, just, and mighty Death!'' [[Walter Raleigh]], ''History of the World''


[[Image:Peter Rabbit - Benjamin and Flopsy Bunny - Project Gutenberg eText 14220.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Peter Rabbit and wife being importuned by Benjamin and Flopsy Bunny - anthropomorphic characters from [[Beatrix Potter]] books]]

==In literature==
Anthropomorphism is a well established device in literature, notably in books for children, such as those by [[C.S. Lewis]], [[Beatrix Potter]] and [[Lewis Carroll]], which involve characters such as [[Peter Rabbit]], the [[Cheshire Cat]], and the fantastical talking animals of [[Narnia]]. Also, [[W.V. Awdry|Rev. W. Awdry]]'s [[The Railway Series|Railway Series]] depicts steam locomotives with human-like faces and personalities.

[[Terry Pratchett]] is notable for having several anthropomorphic personifications in his ''[[Discworld]]'' books. Perhaps best known is the character [[Death (Discworld)|Death]]. [[Piers Anthony]] also wrote a series regarding the seven [[Incarnations of Immortality|incarnations]] of Death, Nature, Time, War, Fate, Good and Evil. [[Neil Gaiman]] is notable for anthropomorphising seven aspects of the world in his series [[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]] - they are called [[the Endless]]: [[Destiny (DC Comics)|Destiny]], [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]], [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]], [[Destruction (DC Comics)|Destruction]], [[Desire (DC Comics)|Desire]], [[Despair (DC Comics)|Despair]], and [[Delirium (DC Comics)|Delirium]].

The Indian books ''[[Panchatantra]]'' (The Five priniciples) and ''[[The Jataka tales]]'' employ this trick of anthromorphized animals very effectively to illustrate various principles of life.

[[Mrs Grundy]] is a personification of conventional propriety.

==Common usage==
It is a common tendency for people to think of inanimate objects as having human-like characteristics. Few, if any people, believe this to have real significance. Common examples of this tendency include naming one's car or begging a machine to work. Advances in [[artificial intelligence]] are beginning to identify such foibles as a potentially more significant phenomenon; however, as [[computer]]s begin to reach the point where they can recognize spoken language. Some computers are already very good at displaying very specific and specialized categories of human-like behaviour, such as learning from their mistakes or anticipating certain input; playing [[chess]] and other games with human-like capability; and even, in the case of [[robot]]s, potentially taking on humanlike form.  [[Anthropomorphobia]], a [[phobia]] traditionally associated with anxiety responses to nonhuman living things displaying human behavior, is now used to define the [[phobia]] of nonliving things that exhibit human qualities.

===Technical use===
[[Hacker|Hackers]] and [[programmers]] have always anthropomorphised technology, mostly as a time-saving device.  Complex technology, specifically [[computers]], can exhibit complicated behavior that can be lengthy to describe in purely inanimate terms.  Hackers, therefore, may use human actions and even emotions to describe a computer system's behavior.  For example, in a situation where a program encounters minor errors but can still accomplish its task, it may do so but emit an error message.  Especially in cases where the error encountered is thought to be trivial, a hacker might say that the computer is complaining.  This human action (complaining) conveys that there is a difficulty while acknowloging the triviality of the difficulty, and perhaps the fact that the program does what was required despite the difficulty.  See the [http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/anthropomorphization.html ''section on anthropomorphism'']in the [[Jargon File]] for more information.

This form of anthropomorphism is common in other technical fields as well.  For example, a [[chemist]] might casually explain an [[ionic bond]] between [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]] by asserting that the sodium atom &quot;wants&quot; to merge with the chlorine atom.  Desire is, of course, a human emotion that atoms are incapable of.  On the other hand, in [[finance]], when a [[Financial market|market]] rises and falls, it might be described as &quot;fickle&quot;, but because it's a human-driven process based on human reactions to market forces, it ''is'' capable of reflecting, if not having, human emotions.  If the criterion for anthropomorphism is that the subject is ascribed human attributes it doesn't have, then financial markets and other demographic forces may not qualify.  However, they might be considered true personifications of human emotion, and qualify the same way as the personification of Desire does.

===Modern occurrences===

[[Image:TV dinosaurs charlene and robbie angry.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|Characters from the television sitcom, ''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Dinosaurs]]'']]
The use of anthropomorphized animals has a long tradition in art and literature. Frequently they are used to portray stereotypical characters, in order to quickly convey the characteristics the author or artist intends for them to possess. Examples include [[Aesop]]'s fables, [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and political cartoons, e.g. ''[[Maus (comics)|Maus]]''. Many of the most famous children's television characters are anthropomorphized [[funny animal]]s: [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Kermit the Frog]], [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], and [[Scrooge McDuck]], for example. While being &quot;funny&quot; is a common trait, it is not a hard rule; Bert the Turtle, star of ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'' is a children-oriented exception. While children- and family-oriented series have often featured anthropomorphic animals, newer adult-oriented television series such as ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[Father of the Pride]]'' also make use of anthropomorphized characters. The human characteristics commonly ascribed to animals in popular culture usually centers around either their perceived personality or disposition (for example, [[owl]]s are usually designated as [[wisdom|wise]]); their appearance alone ([[penguin]]s are usually portrayed as plump [[aristocrats]], because their [[plumage]] resembles a [[black tie|tuxedo]]);  or a combination of both ([[raccoon]]s are commonly portrayed as [[Outlaw|bandits]], both because of the characteristic black stripe over their eyes, which resembles the stereotypical mask of a bandit, and because they roam at night, sometimes breaking into peoples' garbage).

Since the 1980s, [[furry fandom]] has focused on the appreciation, promotion, and production of stories and art about anthropomorphic animals, as well as the exploration, interpretation and examination of humanity and human values through anthropomorphic expression. Furry fandom and the Furry subculture it is part of have only recently come to the attention of the media.

Anthropomorphism has also been frequently applied to entities other than animals in modern times. The [[Red blood cell|red blood cells]] in the film [[Osmosis Jones]] and robots in [[Stanislaw Lem]]'s [[The Cyberiad]] may be considered examples of anthropomorphism.

==In logical reasoning==
[[Image:Dog wearing shades.jpg|thumb|250px|This [[dog]] has been dressed in [[human]] [[accessories]] for [[humorous]] effect.]]Using anthropomorphized caricatures or projecting human qualities on conceptual entities or inanimate objects in [[reasoning]] is also known as committing a [[pathetic fallacy]] (not a pejorative term).

==Opposite view==
While anthropomorphism is the practice of giving animals human qualities, [[Zoomorphism]] is the practice of giving humans animal qualities.  These qualities can include everything from physical shape or movements (&quot;She moves like a cat&quot;, &quot;He looks as strong as a bear&quot;) to mentalities (&quot;He is savage as a lion&quot;, &quot;She's a dumb bunny&quot;) or a mix of the two (&quot;I sting like a bee&quot;).

In the sense that anthropomorphism can include the giving of human qualities to a deity or deities, the opposite is [[Theomorphism]], the giving of divine qualities to humans.

==Slang use==
The [[Furry fandom]]'s growing popularity has increased recognition of the word &quot;anthropomorphism.&quot; However, as use of the word increased, the syllable &quot;po&quot; gradually began to fall out of use by some, hence why many furry websites and comics may use the terms &quot;anthromorphism&quot; or &quot;anthromorphic.&quot; Though technically incorrect and unrecognized by dictionaries, this spelling of the word is rarely corrected in Internet culture.

'''Aramaic''' is a [[Semitic language]] with a 3,000-year history.  It has been the language of administration of empires and the language of divine worship. It is the original language of large sections of the biblical books of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]], and is the main language of the [[Talmud]].  Aramaic is believed to have been the language spoken by [[Aramaic of Jesus|Jesus]], and it is still spoken today as a first language by numerous small communities.

Aramaic belongs to the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[Language families and languages|language family]]. Within that diverse family, it belongs to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] subfamily. Aramaic is a part of the Northwest Semitic group of languages, which also includes the [[Canaanite languages]] (including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]).

==Geographic distribution==
During the [[12th century BC|twelfth century BCE]], [[Aramaeans]], the native speakers of Aramaic, began to settle in great numbers in modern-day [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and eastern [[Turkey]]. As the language grew in importance, it came to be spoken throughout the [[Mediterranean]] coastal area of the [[Levant]], and spread east of the [[Tigris]]. [[Jew]]ish settlers took the language with them into [[north Africa]] and [[Europe]], and Christian missionaries brought Aramaic into [[Iran|Persia]], [[India]] and even [[China]]. From the [[7th century|seventh century CE]] onwards, Aramaic was replaced as the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Middle East]] by [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. However, Aramaic remains a literary and liturgical language among Jews, [[Mandaeans]] and some Christians, and is still spoken by small isolated communities throughout its original area of influence. The turbulence of the last two centuries has seen speakers of first-language and literary Aramaic dispersed throughout the world.

===Aramaic languages and dialects===
Aramaic is really a group of related languages, rather than a single monolithic language. The long history of Aramaic, its extensive literature and its use by different religious communities are all factors in the diversification of the language. Some Aramaic dialects are mutually intelligible, whereas others are not. Some Aramaic languages are known under different names; for example, ''[[Syriac language|Syriac]]'' is particularly used to describe the Eastern Aramaic of Christian communities. Most dialects can be described as either &quot;Eastern&quot;' or &quot;Western,&quot; the dividing line being roughly the [[Euphrates]], or slightly west of it. It is also helpful to draw a distinction between those Aramaic languages that are modern living languages (often called ''Neo-Aramaic''), those that are still in use as literary languages, and those that are extinct and are only of interest to scholars. Although there are some exceptions to this rule, this classification gives &quot;Modern,&quot; &quot;Middle&quot; and &quot;Old&quot; periods, alongside &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; areas, to distinguish between the various languages and dialects that are Aramaic.

==Writing system==
[[Image:Serto.jpg|left|thumb|320px|11th century book in [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac Serto]].]]
The earliest [[Aramaic alphabet]] was based on the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician script]]. In time, Aramaic developed its distinctive 'square' style. The ancient Israelites and other peoples of [[Canaan]] adopted this alphabet for writing their own languages. Thus, it is better known as the [[Hebrew alphabet]] today. This is the writing system used in [[Biblical Aramaic]] and other Jewish writing in Aramaic.

The other main writing system used for Aramaic was developed by Christian communities: a cursive form known as the [[Syriac alphabet]] (one of the varieties of the Syriac alphabet, Serto, is shown to the left).

A highly modified form of the Aramaic alphabet, the [[Mandaic alphabet]], is used by the [[Mandaean]]s.

In addition to these writing systems, certain derivatives of the Aramaic alphabet were used in ancient times by particular groups: [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]] in [[Petra]], for instance, or [[Palmyrenean alphabet|Palmyrenean]] in [[Palmyra]]. In modern times, [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] (see [[#Modern East Aramaic|below]]) has sometimes been written in an adapted [[Latin alphabet]].

Here follows a comprehensive history of Aramaic. The history is broken down into three broad periods:
*[[#Old Aramaic|Old Aramaic]] ([[1100 BC|1100 BCE]]–200 CE), including:
**The [[Biblical Aramaic]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].
**The [[Aramaic of Jesus]].

==Old Aramaic==
Old Aramaic covers over thirteen centuries of the language. This vast time span is chosen as it includes all Aramaic that is now effectively extinct. The main turning point for Old Aramaic is around [[500 BC|500 BCE]], when the Ancient Aramaic (the language of Aramaeans) moves into Imperial Aramaic (the language of powerful empires). The various spoken dialects of Old Aramaic come to prominence when [[Greek language|Greek]] replaces Aramaic as the language of power in the region.

===Ancient Aramaic===
Ancient Aramaic refers to the Aramaic of the [[Arameans|Aramaeans]] from its origin until it becomes the official 'lingua franca' of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. It was the language of the city-states of [[Damascus]], [[Hamath]] and [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]].

====Early Ancient Aramaic====
There are quite extensive inscriptions that evidence the earliest use of the language, dating from the [[10th century BC|tenth century BCE]]. These inscriptions are mostly diplomatic documents between Aramaean city-states. The orthography of Aramaic at this early period seems to be based on [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], and there is a unity in the written language. It seems that, in time, a more refined orthography, suited to the needs of the language, began to develop from this in the eastern regions of Aram. Oddly, the dominance of [[Assyria]]n Empire of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] over Aram in the middle of the eighth century led to the establishment of Aramaic as a [[lingua franca]].

====Late Ancient Aramaic====
From [[700 BC|700 BCE]], the language began to spread in all directions, but lost much of its homogeneity. Different dialects began to emerge in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Babylonia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. However, the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-influenced Aramaic of Assyria, and then [[Babylon]], started to come to the fore. As described in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 18:26, [[Hezekiah]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], negotiates with Assyrian ambassadors in Aramaic so that the common people would not understand. Around [[600 BC|600 BCE]], Adon, a [[Canaan]]ite king, uses Aramaic to write to the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]].

'Chaldee' or 'Chaldean Aramaic' used to be common terms for the Aramaic of the Chaldean dynasty of [[Babylonia]]. It was used to describe [[Biblical Aramaic]], which was, however, written in a later style. It is not to be confused with the modern language [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]].

===Imperial Aramaic===
Around [[500 BC|500 BCE]], [[Darius I]] made Aramaic the official language of the western half of the [[Achaemenid]] [[Persian Empire]]. The bureaucrats in Babylon were already using the local dialect of Eastern Aramaic for most of their work, but Darius's edict put Aramaic on firm, united foundations. The new, Imperial Aramaic was highly standardised; its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect, and the inevitable influence of [[Persian language|Persian]] gave the language a new clarity and robust flexibility. Imperial Aramaic is sometimes called Official Aramaic or [[Biblical Aramaic]]. For centuries after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire (in [[331 BC|331 BCE]]), Imperial Aramaic as prescribed by Darius, or near enough for it to be recognisable, remained the dominant language of the region.

'[[Achaemenid]] Aramaic' is used to describe the Imperial Aramaic of the Achaemenid Empire. This period of Aramaic is usually dated from the proclamation of Darius (''c.'' 500 BCE) to about a century after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BCE. Many of the extant documents witnessing to this form of Aramaic come from [[Egypt]], and [[Elephantine]] in particular. Of them, the most well known is the 'Wisdom of Ahiqar', a book of instructive aphorisms quite similar in style to the biblical [[book of Proverbs]]. Achaemenid Aramaic is sufficiently uniform that it is often difficult to know where any particular example of the language was written. Only careful examination reveals the occasional loan word from a local language.

====Post-Achaemenid Aramaic====
[[Image:Alexander Aramaic coin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Coin of Alexander bearing an Aramaic language inscription.]]
The conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] did not destroy the unity of Aramaic language and literature immediately. Aramaic that bears a relatively close resemblance to that of the [[5th century BC|fifth century BCE]] can be found right up to the early [[2nd century BC|second century]]. The [[Seleucid]]s imposed [[Greek language|Greek]] in the administration of [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]] from the start of their rule. In the [[3rd century BC|third century]], Greek overtook Aramaic as the common language in Egypt and Syria. However, a post-Achaemenid Aramaic continued to flourish from [[Judaea]], through the Syrian Desert, and into [[Arabia]] and [[Parthia]]. This continuation of Imperial Aramaic was a subversive, anti-Hellenistic statement of independence.

[[Biblical Aramaic]] is the Aramaic found in four discrete sections of the [[Hebrew Bible]]:
* [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 4:8–6:18 and 7:12–26 — documents from the Achaemenid period ([[5th century BC|fifth century BCE]]) concerning the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem.
* [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 2:4b–7:28 — five subversive tales and an apocalyptic vision.
* [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 10:11 — a single sentence in the middle of a Hebrew text denouncing idolatry.
* [[Genesis]] 31:47 — translation of a Hebrew place-name.
Biblical Aramaic is a somewhat hybrid dialect. Some Biblical Aramaic material probably originated in both Babylonia and Judaea before the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty. During [[Seleucid]] rule, defiant Jewish propaganda shaped Aramaic [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]. These stories probably existed as oral traditions at their earliest stage. This might be one factor that led to differing collections of Daniel in the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Septuagint]] and the [[Masoretic Text]], which presents a lightly [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-influenced Aramaic.

Under the category of post-Achaemenid is Hasmonaean Aramaic, the official language of [[Hasmonean|Hasmonaean]] Judaea ([[142 BC|142]]–[[37 BC|37]] BCE). It influenced the Biblical Aramaic of the [[Qumran]] texts, and was the main language of non-biblical theological texts of that community. The major [[Targum]]s, translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, were originally composed in Hasmonaean. Hasmonaean also appears in quotations in the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]], although smoothed into its later context. It is written quite differently from Achaemenid Aramaic; there is an emphasis on writing as words are pronounced rather than using etymological forms.

Babylonian [[Targum]]ic is the later post-Achaemenid dialect found in the [[Targum Onkelos|Targum Onqelos]] and [[Targum Jonathan]], the 'official' targums. The original, Hasmonaean targum had reached Babylon sometime in the [[2nd century|second]] or [[3rd century|third]] centuries CE. They were then reworked according to the contemporary dialect of Babylon to create the language of the standard targums. This combination formed the basis of Babylonian Jewish literature for centuries to follow.

[[Image:Targum.jpg|right|thumb|320px|11th century [[Targum]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].]]

Galilean Targumic is similar to Babylonian Targumic. It is the mixing of literary Hasmonaean with the dialect of [[Galilee]]. The Hasmonaean targum reached Galilee in the second century CE, and were reworked into this Galilean dialect for local use. The Galilean Targum was never considered an authoritative work, and documentary evidence shows that its text was amended wherever and whenever 'improvement' was needed. From the [[11th century|eleventh century CE]] onwards, once the Babylonian Targum had become normative, the Galilean version became heavily influenced by it.

Babylonian Documentary Aramaic is a dialect in use from the third century CE onwards. It is the dialect of Babylonian private documents, and, from the [[12th century|twelfth century]], all Jewish private documents in Aramaic. It is based on Hasmonaean with very few changes. This was perhaps due to the fact that many of the documents in BDA are legal documents, the language in them had to be sensible throughout the Jewish community from the start, and Hasmonaean was the old standard.

[[Nabataean]] Aramaic is the language of the Arab kingdom of [[Petra]]. The kingdom (''c.'' [[200 BC|200 BCE]]–[[106|106 CE]] covered the east bank of the [[Jordan River]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northern Arabia. Perhaps because of the importance of the caravan trade, the Nabataeans began to use Aramaic in preference to [[Old North Arabic]]. The dialect is based on Achaemenid with a little influence from Arabic: 'l' is often turned into 'n', and there are a few Arabic loan words. Some Nabataean Aramaic inscriptions exist from the early days of the kingdom, but most are from the first four centuries CE. The language is written in a [[cursive]] script that is the precursor to the modern [[Arabic alphabet]]. The number of Arabic loan words increases through the centuries, until, in the [[4th century|fourth century]], Nabataean merges seamlessly with [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

Palmyrene Aramaic is the dialect that was in use in the city of [[Palmyra]] in the Syrian Desert from [[44 BC|44 BCE]] to 274 CE. It was written in a rounded script, which later gave way to cursive [[Estrangela]]. Like Nabataean, Palmyrene was influenced by Arabic, but to a lesser degree.

[[Arsacid]] Aramaic was the official language of the [[Parthian Empire]] ([[247 BC|247 BCE]]–224 CE). It, more than any other post-Achaemenid dialect, continues the tradition of [[Darius I]]. Over time, however, it came under the influence of contemporary, spoken Aramaic, [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. After the conquest of the Parthians by the Persian-speaking [[Sassanids]], Arsacid exerted considerable influence on the new official language.

===Late Old Eastern Aramaic===
[[Image:Mandaic.jpg|left|thumb|320px|[[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] magical 'demon trap']]

The dialects mentioned in the last section were all descended from Achaemenid Imperial Aramaic. However, the diverse regional dialects of Late Ancient Aramaic continued alongside these, often as simple, spoken languages. Early evidence for these spoken dialects is known only through their influence on words and names in a more standard dialect. However, these regional dialects became written languages in the [[2nd century BC|second century BCE]]. These dialects reflect a stream of Aramaic that is not dependent on Imperial Aramaic, and shows a clear division between the regions of Mesopotamia, Babylon and the east, and Judah, Syria, and the west.

In the east, the dialects of Palmyrene and Arsacid Aramaic merged with the regional languages to create languages with a foot in Imperial and a foot in regional Aramaic. Much later, Arsacid became the liturgical language of the [[Mandaean]] religion, [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]].

In the kingdom of [[Osrhoene]], centred on [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] and founded in [[132 BC|132 BCE]], the regional dialect became the official language: Old [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. On the upper reaches of the [[Tigris]], East Mesopotamian Aramaic flourished, with evidence from [[Hatra]], [[Assur]] and the [[Tur Abdin]]. [[Tatian]], the author of the gospel harmony the [[Diatessaron]] came from Assyria, and perhaps wrote his work (172 CE) in East Mesopotamian rather than Syriac or Greek. In Babylonia, the regional dialect was used by the Jewish community, Jewish Old Babylonian (from ''c.'' [[70]] CE). This everyday language increasingly came under the influence of Biblical Aramaic and Babylonian Targumic.

===Late Old Western Aramaic===
The western regional dialects of Aramaic followed a similar course to those of the east. They are quite distinct from the eastern dialects and Imperial Aramaic. Colloquial Hebrew, and kindred Semitic languages in the Canaanite family, gave way to Aramaic during [[4th century BC|fourth century BCE]]; [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], however, continued into the [[1st century BC|first century BCE]].

The form of Late Old Western Aramaic used by the Jewish community is best attested, and is usually referred to as Jewish Old Palestinian. Its oldest form is Old East Jordanian, which probably comes from the region of [[Caesarea Philippi]]. This is the language of the oldest manuscript of [[Enoch]] (''c.'' [[170 BC|170 BCE]]). The next distinct phase of the language is called Old Judaean (into the second century CE). Old Judaean literature can be found in various inscriptions and personal letters, preserved quotations in the [[Talmud]] and receipts from [[Qumran]]. [[Josephus]]' first, non-extant edition of his ''[[Jewish War]]'' was written in Old Judaean.

The Old East Jordanian dialect continued to be used into the first century CE by pagan communities living to the east of the Jordan. Their dialect is often then called Pagan Old Palestinian, and it was written in a cursive script somewhat similar to that used for Old Syriac. A Christian Old Palestinian dialect may have arisen from the pagan one, and this dialect may be behind some of the Western Aramaic tendencies found in the otherwise eastern Old Syriac gospels (see [[Peshitta]]).

====The spoken dialects of Jesus' time====
: ''See the [[Aramaic of Jesus]] for more information''. 
Seven dialects of Western Aramaic were spoken in [[Jesus]]' time. They were probably distinctive yet mutually intelligible. Old Judaean was the prominent dialect of [[Jerusalem]] and Judaea. The region of [[Ein Gedi|Engedi]] had the South-east Judaean dialect. [[Samaria]] had its distinctive Samaritan Aramaic, where the consonants 'he', 'heth' and '`ayin' all became pronounced as 'aleph'. Galilean Aramaic, the language of Jesus' home region, is only known from a few place names, the influences on Galilean Targumic, some rabbinic literature and a few private letters. It seems to have a number of distinctive features: [[diphthong]]s are never simplified into monophthongs. East of the Jordan, the various dialects of East Jordanian were spoken. In the region of [[Damascus]] and the [[Anti-Lebanon]], Damascene Aramaic was spoken (deduced mostly from Modern Western Aramaic). Finally, as far north as [[Aleppo]], the western dialect of Orontes Aramaic was spoken.

Besides these dialects of Aramaic, Greek was used extensively in urban centres. There is little evidence for the use of Hebrew during this period. Some Hebrew words continued as part of Jewish Aramaic vocabulary (mostly technical religious words, but also some everyday words like `ēṣ, ''tree''), and the written language of the [[Tanakh]] was read and understood by the educated classes. However, the Hebrew language had ceased to be the language of everyday life. In addition, the various words in the Greek context of the [[New Testament]] that are untranslated are clearly Aramaic rather than Hebrew. From the little evidence there is, this Aramaic is not Galilean Aramaic but Old Judaean. This suggests that the words of Jesus were transmitted in the dialect of [[Judaea]] and [[Jerusalem]] rather than that of his hometown.

The 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' is notable for its use of much dialogue in an Aramaic  specially reconstructed by a lone scholar, [[William Fulco]]. However, modern Aramaic speakers found the language stilted and unfamiliar.

==Middle Aramaic==
The [[3rd century|third century CE]] is taken as the threshold between Old and Middle Aramaic. During that century, the nature of the various Aramaic languages and dialects begins to change. The descendents of Imperial Aramaic ceased to be living languages, and the eastern and western regional languages began to form vital, new literatures. Unlike many of the dialects of Old Aramaic, much is known about the vocabulary and grammar of Middle Aramaic.

===Eastern Middle Aramaic===
Only two of the Old Eastern Aramaic languages continued into this period. In the north of the region, Old Syriac moved into Middle Syriac. In the south, Jewish Old Babylonian became Jewish Middle Babylonian. The post-Achaemenid, Arsacid dialect became the background of the new [[Mandaic language]].

====Middle Syriac====

: ''See [[Syriac language]] for more information''.
Middle Syriac is the classical, literary and liturgical language of [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] to this day. Its golden age was the [[4th century|fourth]] to [[6th century|sixth]] centuries. This period began with the translation of the Bible into the language: the [[Peshitta]] and the masterful prose and poetry of [[Ephrem the Syrian]]. Middle Syriac, unlike its forebear, is a thoroughly Christian language, although in time it became the language of those opposed to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] leadership of the church in the east. Missionary activity led to the spread of Syriac through [[Iran|Persia]] and into [[India]] and [[China]].
{{listen|filename=aboun.ogg|title=Abun dbashmayo|description=The [[Lord's Prayer]], ''Abun dbashmayo'',  sung in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]}}

====Jewish Middle Babylonian Aramaic====
Jewish Middle Babylonian is the language employed by Jewish writers in Babylonia between the 4th century and the 11th century CE. It is most commonly identified with the language of the Babylonian [[Talmud]] (which was completed in the [[7th century|seventh century]]) and of post-Talmudic (Geonic) literarure, which are the most important cultural products Babylonian Jewry. The most important epigraphic sources for the dialect are the hundreds of Aramaic magic bowls written in the Jewish script.

====Mandaic====
: ''See [[Mandaic language]] for more information''.
Mandaic is a sister dialect to Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, though it is both linguistically and culturally distinct. Classical Mandaic is the language in which the Mandaean's religious literature was composed. It is characterized by a highly phonetic orthography.

===Western Middle Aramaic===
The dialects of Old Western Aramaic continued with Jewish Middle Palestinian (in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew 'square script']]), Samaritan Aramaic (in the [[Phoenician alphabet|old Hebrew script]]) and Christian Palestinian (in cursive [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac script]]). Of these three, only Jewish Middle Palestinian continued as a written language.

====Jewish Middle Palestinian Aramaic====
In 135, after [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]], many [[Jew]]ish leaders, expelled from [[Jerusalem]], moved to [[Galilee]]. The Galilean dialect thus rose from obscurity to become the standard among Jews in the west. This dialect was spoken not only in Galilee, but also in the surrounding parts. It is the linguistic setting for the [[Jerusalem Talmud|Palestinian Talmud]] (completed in the [[5th century|fifth century]]) and [[midrash]]im (biblical commentaries and teaching). The modern standard of vowel pointing for the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Tiberian system ([[10th century|tenth century]]), was most probably based on the pronunciation of the Galilean dialect of Jewish Middle Palestinian. The inscription in the synagogue at [[Dura-Europos]] are either in Middle East Jordanian or Middle Judaean.

Middle Judaean, the descendent of Old Judaean, is no longer the dominant dialect, and was used only in southern Judaea (the variant Engedi dialect continued throughout this period). Likewise, Middle East Jordanian continues as a minor dialect from Old East Jordanian.

====Samaritan Aramaic====
The Aramaic dialect of the [[Samaritan]] community is earliest attested by a documentary tradition that can be dated back to the fourth century. Its modern pronunciation is based on the form used in the tenth century.

====Christian Palestinian Aramaic====
The language of Western-Aramaic-speaking Christians is evidenced from the sixth century, but probably existed two centuries earlier. The language itself comes from Christian Old Palestinian, but its writing conventions were based on early Middle Syriac, and it was heavily influenced by Greek. The name Jesus, although ''Yešû`'' in Aramaic, is written ''Yesûs'' in Christian Palestinian.

==Modern Aramaic==
{{main|Neo-Aramaic languages}}
Over four hundred thousand people speak Aramaic to this day. They are Jews, Christians, Muslims and Mandaeans, living in remote areas and preserving their traditions with printing presses, and now electronic media. The Modern Aramaic (or ''Neo-Aramaic'') languages are now farther apart in their comprehension of one another than perhaps they have ever been. The last two-hundred years have not been good to Aramaic speakers. Instability throughout the Middle East has lead to a worldwide diaspora of Aramaic speakers. The year 1915 is especially prominent for Aramaic-speaking Christians: called ''[[Syriac genocide|Sayfo/Saypā]]'' (''sword'' in Syriac), all Christian groups ([[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Armenians]] and others) living in eastern [[Turkey]] were the subject of the persecutions that marked the end of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. For Aramaic-speaking Jews 1950 is a watershed year: the newly founded state of [[Israel]] led most Aramaic-speaking Jews to emigrate there. However, removal to Israel has led to Jewish Neo-Aramaic being swamped in a sea of Modern Hebrew, and the practical extinction of many Jewish dialects is imminent.

===Modern Eastern Aramaic===
Modern Eastern Aramaic exists in a wide variety of dialects and languages. There is significant difference between the Aramaic spoken by Jews, Christians and Mandaeans.

The Christian languages are often called Modern [[Syriac language|Syriac]] (or Neo-Syriac, particularly when referring to their literature), being deeply influenced by the literary and liturgical language of Middle Syriac. However, they also have roots in numerous, previously unwritten, local Aramaic dialects, and are not purely the direct descendants of the language of [[Ephrem the Syrian]].

Modern Western Syriac (also called Central Neo-Aramaic, being in between Western Neo-Aramaic and Eastern Neo-Syriac) is generally represented by [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]], the language of the [[Tur Abdin]]. A related language, [[Mlahso language|Mlahsö]], has recently become extinct.

The eastern Christian languages (Modern Eastern Syriac or Eastern Neo-Aramaic) are often called ''Sureth'' or ''Suret'', from a native name. They are also sometimes called ''[[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Assyrian]]'' or ''[[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]]'', but these names are not accepted by all speakers. The dialects are not all mutually intelligible. East Syriac communities are usually either [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Catholics]] or [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrians]].

The [[Judeo-Aramaic language|Jewish Modern Aramaic languages]] are now mostly spoken in [[Israel]], and most are facing extinction (older speakers are not passing the language to younger generations). The Jewish dialects that have come from communities that once lived between [[Lake Urmia]] and [[Mosul]] are not all mutually intelligible. In some places, for example [[Urmia]], Christians and Jews speak unintelligible dialects of Modern Eastern Aramaic in the same place. In others, the plain of Mosul for example, the dialects of the two faith communities are similar enough to allow conversation.

A few Mandaeans living in the province of [[Khuzestan]] in [[Iran]] speak Modern [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]]. It is quite distinct from any other Aramaic dialect.

===Modern Western Aramaic===
{{main|Western Neo-Aramaic}}
Very little remains of Western Aramaic. It is still spoken in the Christian village of [[Ma'loula|Ma`loula]] in Syria and the Muslim villages of [[Bakh`a]] and [[Jubb`adin]] in [[Syria]]'s [[Anti-Lebanon]], as well as by some people who migrated from these villages to [[Damascus]] and other larger towns of Syria. All these speakers of Modern Western Aramaic are fluent in Arabic, which has now become the main language in these villages.

==Sounds==
Each dialect of Aramaic has its own distinctive pronunciation, and it would not be possible here to go into all these properties. Aramaic has a phonological palette of 25 to 40 distinct phonemes. In general, older dialects tended to have a richer phonology than more modern ones. In particular, some modern Jewish Aramaic pronunciations lack the series of 'emphatic' consonants. Other dialects have borrowed from the inventories of surrounding languages, particularly [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

===Vowels===
As with most Semitic languages, Aramaic can be thought of as having three basic sets of vowels:
* Open ''a''-vowels
* Close front ''i''-vowels
* Close back ''u''-vowels
These vowel groups are relatively stable, but the exact articulation of any individual is most dependent on its consonantal setting.

The cardinal open vowel is an open near-front unrounded vowel ('short' ''a'', like the first vowel in the English 'batter', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/a/}}). It usually has a back counterpart ('long' ''a'', like the ''a'' in 'father', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, or even tending to the vowel in 'caught', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/ɔ/}}), and a front counterpart ('short' ''e'', like the vowel in 'head', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/ɛ/}}). There is much correspondence between these vowels between dialects.  There is some evidence that Middle Babylonian dialects did not distinguish between the short ''a'' and short ''e''. In West Syriac dialects, and possibly Middle Galilean, the long ''a'' became the ''o'' sound. The open ''e'' and back ''a'' are often indicated in writing by the use of the letters 'alaph' (a [[glottal stop]]) or 'he' (like the English ''h'').

The cardinal close front vowel is the 'long' ''i'' (like the vowel in 'need', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/i/}}). It has a slightly more open counterpart, the 'long' ''e'', as in the final vowel of 'café' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/e/}}). Both of these have shorter counterparts, which tend to be pronounced slightly more open. Thus, the short close ''e'' corresponds with the open ''e'' in some dialects. The close front vowels usually use the consonant ''y'' as a [[matres lectionis|mater lectionis]].

The cardinal close back vowel is the 'long' ''u'' (like the vowel in 'school', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/u/}}). It has a more open counterpart, the 'long' ''o'', like the vowel in 'low' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/o/}}). There are shorter, and thus more open, counterparts to each of these, with the short close ''o'' sometimes corresponding with the long open ''a''. The close back vowels often use the consonant ''w'' to indicate their quality.

Two basic [[diphthong]]s exist: an open vowel followed by ''y'' (''ay''), and an open vowel followed by ''w'' (''aw''). These were originally full diphthongs, but many dialects have converted them to ''e'' and ''o'' respectively.

The so-called 'emphatic' consonants (see the next section) cause all vowels to become mid-centralised.

===Consonants===
The various alphabets used for writing Aramaic languages have twenty-two letters (all of which are consonants). Some of these letters, though, can stand for two or three different sounds (usually a [[Stop consonant|plosive]] and a [[fricative]] at the same point of articulation). Aramaic classically uses a series of lightly contrasted plosives and fricatives:
* Labial set: ''p''/''f'' and ''b''/''v'',
* Dental set: ''t''/''θ'' and ''d''/''ð'',
* Velar set: ''k''/''x'' and ''g''/''ɣ''.
Each member of a certain pair is written with the same letter of the alphabet in most writing systems (that is, ''p'' and ''f'' are written with the same letter), and are near [[allophone]]s.

A distinguishing feature of Aramaic phonology (and that of Semitic languages in general) is the presence of 'emphatic' consonants. These are consonants that are pronounced with the root of the tongue retracted, with varying degrees of [[pharyngealization]] and [[velar|velarisation]]. Using their alphabetic names, these emphatics are:
* {{unicode|Ḥêṯ}}, a [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]], [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: /ħ/ (like the sound made breathing on glass),
* {{unicode|Ṭêṯ}}, a pharyngealized ''t'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: /{{IPA|tˁ}}/,
* {{unicode|ʽAyn}}, a pharyngealized [[glottal stop]] (sometimes considered to be a [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]]), [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: /{{IPA|ʕ}}/ or /{{IPA|ʔˁ}}/,
* {{unicode|Ṣāḏê}}, a pharyngealized ''s'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: /{{IPA|sˁ}}/,
* {{unicode|Qôp̄}}, an [[uvular]] ''k'' (a [[voiceless uvular plosive]]), [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: /q/.{{listen|filename=Aramaic_emphatics.ogg|title=The emphatic consonants of Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Ancient Aramaic may have had a larger series of emphatics. Not all dialects of Aramaic give these consonants their historic values.

Overlapping with the set of emphatics are the 'guttural' consonants. They include {{unicode|Ḥêṯ}} and {{unicode|ʽAyn}} from the emphatic set, and add {{unicode|ʼĀlap̄}} (a [[glottal stop]]) and {{unicode|Hê}} (as the English 'h').

Aramaic classically has a set of four [[sibilant consonant|sibilants]] (Ancient Aramaic may have had six):
* /s/ (as in English 'sea'),
* /z/ (as in English 'zero'),
* /{{IPA|ʃ}}/ (as in English 'ship'),
* /{{IPA|sˁ}}/ (the emphatic {{unicode|Ṣāḏê}} listed above).

In addition to these sets, Aramaic has the [[nasal consonant]]s ''m'' and ''n'', and the [[approximant consonant|approximants]] ''r'' (usually an [[alveolar trill]]), ''l'', ''y'' and ''w''.

===Historical sound changes===
Six broad features of sound change can be seen as dialect differentials:
# Vowel change — This occurs almost too frequently to document fully, but is a major distinctive feature of different dialects.
# Plosive/fricative pair reduction — Originally, Aramaic, like [[Tiberian Hebrew]], had fricatives as conditioned [[allophone]]s for each plosive.  In the wake of vowel changes, the distinction eventually became phonemic; still later, it was often lost in certain dialects.  For example, [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] has mostly lost /p/, using /f/ instead; other dialects (for instance, standard [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]) have lost /θ/ and /ð/ and replaced them with /t/ and /d/. In most dialects of Modern Syriac, /f/ and /v/ become /w/ after a vowel.
# Loss of emphatics — Some dialects have replaced emphatic consonants with non-emphatic counterparts, while those spoken in the [[Caucasus]] often have [[glottal consonant|glottalized]] rather than [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] emphatics.
# Guttural assimilation — This is the main feature of Samaritan pronunciation, also found in [[Samaritan Hebrew]]: all the gutturals are reduced to a simple glottal stop. Some Modern Aramaic dialects do not pronounce ''h'' in all words (the third person masculine pronoun 'hu' becomes 'ow').
# Proto-Semitic */θ/ */ð/ are reflected in Aramaic as */t/, */d/, whereas they became sibilants in Hebrew (the number three in Hebrew is 'šālôš', but '{{unicode|tlāṯ}}' in Aramaic). Dental/sibilant shifts are still happening in the modern dialects.
# New phonetic inventory — Modern dialects have borrowed sounds from the surrounding, dominant languages. The usual inventory is /{{IPA|ʒ}}/ (as the first consonant in 'azure'), /{{IPA|ʤ}}/ (as in 'jam') and /{{IPA|ʧ}}/ (as in 'church'). The [[Syriac alphabet]] has been adapted for writing these new sounds.

==Grammar==
As with other Semitic languages, Aramaic [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the way words are put together) is based on the [[triliteral]] root. The root consists of three consonants and has a basic meaning, for example, ''k-t-b'' has the meaning of 'writing'. This is then modified by the addition of vowels and other consonants to create different nuances of the basic meaning:
* ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇâ}}'', handwriting, inscription, script, book.
* ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇê}}'', the Scriptures.
* ''{{unicode|Kāṯûḇâ}}'', secretary, scribe.
* ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇeṯ}}'', I wrote.
* ''{{unicode|Eḵtûḇ}}'', I shall write.{{listen|filename=kthovo.ogg|title=Aramaic words based on the triliteral root ''k-t-b''|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Aramaic has two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine. Nouns can be either singular or plural, but an additional 'dual' number exists for nouns that usually come in pairs. The dual number gradually disappeared from Aramaic over time and has little influence in Middle and Modern Aramaic.

Aramaic nouns and adjectives can exist in one of three states; these states correspond in part to the role of cases in other languages. The 'absolute' state is the basic form of a noun (for example, ''{{unicode|kṯâḇâ}}'', 'handwriting'). The 'construct' state is a truncated form of the noun used to make possessive phrases (for example, ''{{unicode|kṯāḇaṯ malkṯâ}}'', 'the handwriting of the queen). The 'emphatic' or 'determined' state is an extended form of the noun that functions a bit like a definite article (which Aramaic lacks; for example, ''{{unicode|kṯāḇtâ}}'', 'the handwriting'). In time, the construct state began to be replaced by other possessive phrases, and the emphatic state became the norm in most dialects. Most dialects of Modern Aramaic use only the emphatic state.

The various forms of possessive phrases (for 'the handwriting of the queen') are:
# ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇaṯ malkṯâ}}'' — The oldest construction: the possessed object is in the construct state.
# ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇtâ d(î)-malkṯâ}}'' — Both words are in the emphatic state and the relative particle ''d(î)-'' is used to mark the relationship.
# ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇtāh d(î)-malkṯâ}}'' — Both words are in the emphatic state, and the relative particle is used, but the possessed is given an anticipatory, pronominal ending (literally, 'her writing, that (of) the queen').
In Modern Aramaic, the last form is by far the most common. In Biblical Aramaic, the last form is virtually absent.{{listen|filename=kthovath malktho.ogg|title=Different variations of the possessive construction in Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The Aramaic verb has six 'conjugations' or stems: alterations to the verbal root that can mark the [[passive voice]] (''{{unicode|eṯkṯeḇ}}'', 'it was written'), intensive (''{{unicode|katteḇ}}'', 'he decreed (in writing)'), the extensive (''{{unicode|aḵteḇ}}'', 'he composed') or a combination of these. Aramaic also has two proper [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: the perfect and the imperfect. In Imperial Aramaic, the [[participle]] began to be used for a [[historic present]]. Perhaps under influence from other languages, Middle Aramaic developed a system of composite tenses (combinations of forms of the verb with pronouns or an [[auxiliary verb]]), allowing for narrative that is more vivid.

The syntax of Aramaic (the way sentences are put together) usually follows the order verb-subject-object (VSO).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[New Testament]], '''Titus''', (a common Roman name, meaning ''honourable'') was a companion of [[Paul of Tarsus]], mentioned in several of [[Epistle|Paul's Epistles]]. Titus was with Paul and [[Barnabas]] at [[Antioch]] and accompanied them to the [[Council of Jerusalem]] ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 2:1-3; Acts 15:2), although his name nowhere occurs in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]''. 

He appears to have been a [[Gentile]]&amp;mdash; for Paul sternly refused to have him [[History_of_male_circumcision#Male_Circumcision_in_the_Greco-Roman_World|circumcised]], perhaps because Paul possibly believed his gospel freed believers from the requirements of the [[Mosaic Law]]&amp;mdash; and to have been chiefly engaged in ministering to Gentiles. 

At a later period, Paul's Epistles place him with Paul and [[Timothy]] at [[Ephesus]], whence he was sent by Paul to [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]] for the purpose of getting the contributions of the church there in behalf of the poor  Christians at Jerusalem sent forward ([[2 Corinthians]] 8:6; 12:18). 

He rejoined the apostle when he was in [[Macedon]]ia, and cheered him with the tidings he brought from Corinth (7:6-15). After this his name is not mentioned till after Paul's first imprisonment, when we find him engaged in the organization of the church in [[Crete]], where the apostle had left him for this purpose (Paul's ''[[Epistle to Titus|Titus]]'' 1:5). 

The last notice of him is in [[2 Timothy]] 4:10, where we find him with Paul at Rome during his second imprisonment. From Rome he was sent into [[Dalmatia]], no doubt on some important missionary errand. The New Testament does not record his death.  

According to church tradition, Paul ordained Titus Bishop of [[Gortyn]] in Crete.  He died in AD [[107]] at about 95 years of age.

'''Americanization''' (or '''Americanisation''') is the term used for the influence the [[United States|United States of America]] has on the culture of other [[country|countries]], substituting their [[culture]] with [[American culture]]. When encountered unwillingly or perforce, it has a negative connotation; when sought voluntarily, it has a positive connotation. 

Americanization can also refer to the process of [[Immigration|immigrants]] to the United States becoming [[Assimilation (sociology)#Immigration|assimilated]] into American society.  This process often involves learning [[American English]] and adjusting to American culture, customs, and dress.

==Media==
In American media, the term is used negatively to describe the [[censoring]] and [[editing]] of a foreign show or movie that is brought over to U.S. stations. This editing is done to make the work more understandable to American audiences. The changes are often so drastic that very little - if any - evidence of the media's true origin remains.

In [[Hollywood]], many foreign film productions (most of them from [[Europe]] and [[Far East]]) were remade into U.S.-produced versions for American viewers, readapting the story according to the American culture. Most of the Americanized versions were filmed in American places, and with English speaking actors. Examples include ''[[Godzilla]]'', ''[[The Assassin]]'' (aka ''[[Nikita]]'') and ''[[The Ring]]''.

The song [[Amerika (single)|Amerika]] by the German rock band [[Rammstein]] is often seen as a [[satire]] of Americanization. It has received mixed reviews: some perceive it as anti-American, others as being opposed to [[globalization]]. The band views it as a satirical commentary on &quot;[[cocacolonization]]&quot;.

===Anime===
Companies that deal with Japanese [[Anime]] may Americanize the animation in order to appeal to a larger audience beyond the established fanbases made via importation of DVD's, obtaining bootlegs, or downloading [[fansubs]] from the internet. American Cartoon companies like [[4Kids Entertainment]], [[Nelvana]], [[FUNimation]], and [[TOKYOPOP]], are the more notorious examples of companies that undertake edits.  In these cases, Americanization due to translation of Japanese [[Anime]] may be minor or may result in a complete change to the piece.  

Examples of minor Americanization include simple name changes (Riceballs turned into Cookies and Doughnuts, or the name of the character Itsuki changed to Iggy).  Extreme edits include dismantling entire episodes for content and time constraints; for example, ''[[One Piece]]'' has undergone changes in the theme song and entire re-writes of story arcs. 

In many cases, Anime is Americanized because the content, which would be considered acceptable for Japanese children to view, would not be allowed for children in the USA under [[FCC]] rules.

==Trivia==
In [[Sweden]], there is a humourous expression stating that it is the most Americanized country in the world, and the USA is number two.

[[Arthur Koestler]] described Americanization as &quot;[[cocacolonization]]&quot; in his book ''[[The Lotus and the Robot]]'', referring to [[Coca-Cola]], a symbol of American culture.

The '''actinide''' series encompasses the 15 [[chemical element]]s that lie between [[actinium]] and [[lawrencium]] on the [[periodic table]] with [[atomic number]]s 89 - 103. The actinide series is named after actinium. All actinides are [[f-block]] elements except lawrencium. There are also alternative arrangements which do not include either actinium or lawrencium in the actinide series.

The actinides  display less similarity in their chemical properties than the [[lanthanide]] series, for instance exhibiting a wider range of oxidation states, which initially led to confusion as to whether actinium, thorium and uranium should be consider d-block elements. All actinides are radioactive.

Only actinium, thorium and uranium occur naturally in the earth's crust. The remaining actinides were synthesized in the 20th cenutry by techniques such as neutron bombardment. The latter half of the series possess exceedingly short  [[half-life|half-lives]]. 

The actinides are typically placed below the main body of the periodic table, in the manner of a footnote. The [[Periodic table (wide)|full-width version of the periodic table]] shows the position of the actinides more clearly.

Note that the [[IUPAC|International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)]] are currently recommending the name '''actinoid''' rather than actinide, as the suffix &quot;-ide&quot; is generally used to indicate [[anions]].

[[Image:Arthur miller.JPG|thumb|Arthur Miller in his later years]]
'''Arthur Asher Miller''' ([[October 17]], [[1915]] – [[February 10]], [[2005]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]], [[essayist]] and [[author]]. He was a prominent figure in [[American literature]] and [[film|cinema]] for over 61 years, writing a wide variety of [[play]]s. Miller's best-known works were ''[[The Crucible]]'', After the Fall (which won the 1947 Tony Award for best play),  and ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', which are still widely studied and performed worldwide . He was also known for his short-lived marriage to [[Marilyn Monroe]] (1956-1961), who converted to [[Judaism]] for him. 

==Biography==
Miller was born into a moderately-wealthy [[Jewish]] family in New York. His father was a clothing manufacturer. His mother was a housewife. His sister, Joan became an actress known as [[Joan Copeland]] and has appeared in some of her brother's plays. 

Miller attended P.S. 24 in Harlem from 1920 to 1928, and saw his first play (a [[melodrama]]) in 1923 at the Shubert Theatre. At Abraham Lincoln High School near [[Coney Island]], in [[Brooklyn, New York]], Miller was a talented athlete and mediocre student. He was rejected by both the [[University of Michigan]] and suffered a great deal of [[anti-Semitism]], which would influence his later works. Miller put $13 of every $15 pay check he earned into a college fund and reapplied to the University of Michigan, where he was accepted in 1934.

At Michigan, Miller studied journalism and drama, becoming particularly interested in [[Greek theater|ancient Greek drama]] and the dramas of [[Henrik Ibsen]]. During [[spring break]] in 1936 (his sophomore year), he wrote his first work, ''[[No Villain]]'' (reportedly because of a contest offering a $250 prize, which [[Hopwood Award|Avery Hopwood Award]], the first of two he received. Miller retained strong ties to his alma mater throughout the rest of his life, establishing the Arthur Miller Award in 1985 and Arthur Miller Award for Dramatic Writing in 1999, and lending his name to the Arthur Miller Theatre in the forthcoming In 1938, Miller received his [[bachelor's degree]] in English. In 1940, he married his college sweetheart, Mary Slattery (with whom he had two children, Jane and Robert). He was exempted from military service during [[World War II]] because of a [[American football|football]] injury.

Miller rose to prominence with ''[[All My Sons]]'' in 1947.  His 1949 play ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and three [[Tony Awards]], as well as the [[New York Drama Critics Circle Award]]. It was the first play ever to win all three.  ''[[The Crucible]]'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on [[January 22]], [[1953]]. In 1956, he divorced his wife. In June of the same year, he appeared before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], and at the end of the month on [[June 29]], he married [[Marilyn Monroe]], whom he had met eight years earlier through [[Elia Kazan]]. Monroe [[List of converts to Judaism|converted to Judaism]] .

On [[May 31]], [[1957]], Miller was found guilty of [[contempt of Congress]] for refusing to reveal the names of members of a literary circle suspected of Communist affiliation. His conviction was reversed [[August 7]], [[1958]], by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The same year, he published ''Collected Plays''.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Miller&amp;Monroe.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Monroe and Miller on the set of ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'']] --&gt;
On [[January 24]], [[1961]], Monroe was granted a divorce two months after Miller left her for  [[Inge Morath]], whom he married on [[February 17]], [[1962]]. They had met when she and other photographers from the [[Magnum Photos]] agency documented the making of ''The Misfits''. They had two children, Rebecca, born that September, and Daniel. According to biographer [[Martin Gottfried]], Daniel was born with [[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome]]. Miller placed Daniel in an institution in [[Roxbury, Connecticut]], and never visited him. Miller doesn't mention Daniel in ''Timebends'', his 1987 autobiography, and the issue was ignored in the ''[[New York Times]]'' obituary[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/11/theater/11cnd-miller.html?hp=&amp;amp;pagewanted=print&amp;amp;position=] of [[February 11]], [[2005]] (though it was reported in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and elsewhere).  [[Rebecca Miller]] is a screenwriter, actor and director.

Miller was one of the original founders of [[International PEN]]'s Writers in Prison committee, and in 1965 was elected the organization's president, a position he held for four years [http://mattryan.netfirms.com/MillerBio.htm], [http://av.rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A9ibyK_Qpg5CiAMAXX9rCqMX;_ylu=X3oDMTBvdmM3bGlxBHBndANhdl93ZWJfcmVzdWx0BHNlYwNzcg--/SIG=124m2bp4t/**http%3a//www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml%3fi=20040112%26s=miller].

In 1985, Miller visited [[Turkey]] and was honored at the American embassy. After his traveling companion [[Harold Pinter]]  was thrown out of the country for discussing torture, Miller left in support.

On [[January 30]], [[2002]], Inge Morath died. On [[May 1]] the same year, Miller was awarded Spain's [[Principe de Asturias Prize for Literature]] as &quot;the undisputed master of modern drama&quot;. Previous winners include [[Doris Lessing]], [[Günter Grass]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]]. The following year Miller won the [[Jerusalem Prize]].

In December 2004, the 89 year old Miller announced that he had been living with 34 year old artist [[Agnes Barley]] since 2002, and they were planning to marry. Within hours of his death, Barley had moved out of his house on orders of Miller's daughter Rebecca, who disapproved of the relationship.

[[Image:Angelina Jolie.jpg|thumb|right|Angelina Jolie at the premiere of ''[[Alexander (film)|Alexander]]''.]]
'''Angelina Jolie''' (born  '''Angelina Jolie Voight''' on [[June 4]], [[1975]]) is an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning [[United States|American]] [[actor|actress]]. 
She is known for her exotic looks, her tumultuous off-screen life, and her humanitarian work with refugees. She has received three [[Golden Globe|Golden Globes]] as well as an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance in the film ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]''.

==Biography== 
Angelina Jolie was born in [[Los Angeles, California]], to actors [[Jon Voight]] and [[Marcheline Bertrand]]. She is the niece of [[Chip Taylor]] and the god-daughter of [[Jacqueline Bisset]] and [[Maximilian Schell]]. She is also the sister of [[James Haven]]. In a [[2004]] article in ''[[Vogue_%28magazine%29|Vogue]]'' she stated that her mother is from [[Chicago]]. At the ''Premiere Magazine'' &quot;Women in Hollywood&quot; Awards, she said her mother was born in a bowling alley and has stated that because of her name people often assume that her mother is French.  Jolie's grandparents were [[French-Canadian]].  Her paternal-grandfather was from [[Czechoslovakia]].  Her mother also studied with [[Lee Strasberg]]. She is of [[Czech people|Czech]], French-Canadian, [[English people|English]], and [[Iroquois]] descent. As a teenager, Jolie dreamed of becoming a funeral director.[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/5938014] She attended the [[Lee Strasberg]] Theatre Institute from the age of 11, later attending [[Beverly Hills High School]]. Though she enrolled at the film school at [[New York University]] after finishing ''[[Gia]]'', she did not complete her studies.

Jolie has been long estranged from her father, though a reconciliation was attempted by his appearing with her in ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''. In the October 2004 issue of ''[[Premiere Magazine]]'', Jolie indicated that she was no longer interested in pursuing a relationship with her father, but that she did not hate him because she realised that &quot;...we only have so much energy in this life&quot;.  Soon afterwards, he claimed that she has &quot;serious emotional problems&quot; on ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', and she legally dropped Voight as her last name, taking &quot;Angelina Jolie&quot; as her legal name. 
 
===Career===
Her first starring role came in the [[1995]] film ''[[Hackers_%28film%29|Hackers]].'' 

In [[1998]] she achieved a major critical success, starring in the TV film ''[[Gia]]'', the true story of 1970-80s supermodel [[Gia Carangi]], who died of [[AIDS]].  Jolie won [[Golden Globe]], [[Screen Actors Guild]] and Golden Satmifie awards, and was nominated for an [[Emmy]].
 
She had roles in several box-office flops until [[1999]], when she co-starred in ''[[The Bone Collector]]'' with [[Denzel Washington]] and won an Oscar for ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]''. Her first headlining blockbuster role came from [[2001]]'s video-game-based ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''.

Several of her subsequent films, such as ''[[Life or Something Like It]]'', ''[[Alexander (movie)|Alexander]]'', and ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow ]]'', were box-office disappointments, although Jolie herself usually received good notices.  She did provide the voice of Lola in the successful animated film ''[[Shark Tale]]''.  Nonetheless, she has become one of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]]'s most &quot;in-demand&quot; actresses. Following the success of ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'', she's set to earn up to $15 million to star in the film ''[[The_Good_Shepherd_%28film%29|The Good Shepherd]]''.

Apart from  her acting and humanitarian endeavours, Jolie has worked as a professional model in [[London]], [[New York City|New York]] and Los Angeles and appeared in numerous music videos, including those of [[Korn]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], and [[The Rolling Stones]].

==Relationships==
[[Image:Angelina jolie lugar.jpg|thumb|right|Angelina Jolie]]

On [[March 28]], [[1996]] she married [[United Kingdom|British]] actor [[Jonny Lee Miller]], with whom she had co-starred in the film ''[[Hackers (movie)|Hackers]]''.  Jolie attended her wedding in black leather trousers and a white shirt, which had her husband's name painted in her blood on the back. Jolie and Miller subsequently divorced on [[February 3]], [[1999]].  Jolie then married American actor [[Billy Bob Thornton]] on [[May 5]], [[2000]].  As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love (most famously wearing one others' blood in vials around their necks), their relationship became a favourite topic of the entertainment media.  Jolie and Thornton divorced on [[May 27]], [[2003]].

Jolie has said in interviews that she is [[bisexual]]. In an interview with [[Barbara Walters]], Jolie said &quot;If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her?  If I fell in love with her?  Absolutely!  Yes!&quot;[http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/387860p-329048c.html]  In an interview with a British [[tabloid]], model [[Jenny Shimizu]] claimed to have enjoyed a long-standing romantic and sexual relationship with her former ''[[Foxfire (1996 film)|Foxfire]]'' co-star.

===Brad Pitt===
In early [[2005]], Jolie found herself in the middle of a well-publicised Hollywood [[Sex scandal|scandal]] when she was accused of being the &quot;other woman&quot; in the [[divorce|marital break-up]] of [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]].  The allegation was that she and Pitt had started an [[affair]] during filming of the spy comedy ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]''.  However, in several interviews she has denied starting an affair with Pitt.  In an interview with ''[[Marie Claire]]'' magazine recently she stated that she could never have a relationship with a married man because she has seen what relationships like that did to her mother.  Her father has acknowledged that he cheated on Jolie's mother when they were married.  Jolie stated that she &quot;could not look herself in the mirror&quot; if she had an affair with a married man.

Thanks to a mixture of generally good reviews, advance [[publicity]] and the rumours, ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' opened in the No. 1 position at the box-office after it was released in early June 2005, providing Jolie with her first box-office success in several years.

In late June 2005, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported a claim that Jolie was [[pregnant]] - a report republished on [[June 30]] by Britain's [[Sky TV]], [[Sun Media Corporation]] in [[Canada]], and the [[Asia|Asian]] ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', among others. Her publicist denied this report, which would ultimately prove to be premature.

Speculation over the nature of Jolie and Pitt's relationship continued throughout the summer of 2005. On [[August 22]], the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' ran a front-page story with a photo of Jolie taken during a surprise visit she made to [[Calgary, Alberta]] a couple of days earlier, accompanied by her adopted daughter Zahara. Pitt was at that time filming in Calgary, as was her father, [[Jon Voight]]. It was later reported that Jolie and Pitt visited the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology]] in [[Drumheller, Alberta]] together[http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,17225,00.html], and sources reported in [[September]], 2005 that they had visited [[West Edmonton Mall]] together.[http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/2005/09/22/1230579-sun.html]

On [[September 30]], the ''Calgary Sun'' reported that Pitt and Jolie had rented a house together in the city of [[Spruce Grove, Alberta]], west of [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] where Pitt was filming; the same issue printed a photograph of the couple, now dubbed &quot;Brangelina&quot;, leaving an Edmonton grocer's.

On [[January 11]], [[2006]], both Jolie's and Pitt's representatives confirmed, through ''[[People Magazine]]'', that the two were expecting their first child in Summer [[2006]], thus indirectly confirming for the first time that they were in a relationship.[http://people.aol.com/people/articles/0,19736,1145171,00.html]

==Humanitarian Work==
[[Image:NotesFromMyTravels.jpg|right|180px|thumb|In 2003, Jolie published a collection of journals made during missions for the UNHCR.  Her proceeds from the book went to the UNHCR.]]

Jolie has been a [[UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador|Goodwill Ambassador]] for the [[United Nations High Commission for Refugees]] since [[2001]], and frequently travels to countries in order to draw attention to the plight of people in developing countries.  In [[2003]], she published ''[[Notes from My Travels]]'', a collection of journal entries that chronicled her early work with the [[United Nations|U.N.]]. 

In a January 2005 [http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/01/29/davos.jolie.reut/index.html interview] with [[Reuters]], Jolie criticised fellow actors and actresses for not being committed enough in helping others, and stated that she gives one-third of her income to charitable institutions. On [[October 12]], [[2005]], Jolie was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the [[UNA-USA]].

Jolie was also one of the first [[celebrity|celebrities]] to accept an invitation to be one of the bearers of the [[Olympic Torch]] during the [[2004 Olympic Games]], though she was ultimately unable to participate because of filming commitments.

Since taking on her goodwill ambassador duties, Jolie has on numerous occasions made public statements that she wants to quit acting and concentrate on her UN work (for example, see ''Ireland On-Line'' in June 2005 [http://breakingnews.iol.ie/entertainment/story.asp?j=145628738&amp;p=y456z9444]).  However, she has also stated that her work provides her with the income necessary for her to continue travelling the world on behalf of the UN.

Jolie continues to balance the demands of being a film-star with that of being a humanitarian, despite an apparently gruelling schedule. On [[June 7]], 2005, the [[Associated Press]] wire service reported on Jolie giving a presentation in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]].  That same day, she attended the premiere of ''Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith'' in [[Los Angeles]].  She now lives full-time in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]], and owns property in [[Cambodia]], which she had to have demined.  Angelina Jolie spent the new year of 2005 by going abroad to film a documentary called &quot;A Moment in the World&quot;.  She called on several actors and actresses to film in various locations around the world at the same time for three minutes. This was done in order to capture random moments that are happening across the world at the same time.  Some confusion has arisen between this project and the independent endeavour [http://www.momentonearth.com  A Moment on Earth], in which 60 film-makers around the world captured two separate moments on  5th and 6th August, 2004.  No release dates for either project are known at this time.

In August 2005, Cambodia's King [[Norodom Sihamoni]] awarded Jolie Cambodian [[citizenship]] for her [[conservation ethic|conservation]] work in the country.

In September 2005 Jolie was named the new spokesperson for the clothing line 'St. John Knits' starting in the Spring/Autumn 0f 2006. The deal with includes the start-up of a charity headed by Jolie.  The charity will focus on children's issues and causes.  It has been reported, but not confirmed, that she will also sit on the board of directors and have stock in the company.  The deal is also believed to be the biggest celebrity clothing endorsement with the actress receiving US$10-15 million.  Other celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow receive something about US$5 million to promote luxury clothing and accessories.  On 24 October, Angelina Jolie attended the 'First Annual Benefit Gala for the Worldwide Orphans Foundation'. Where she pledged to partner with WHO to treat children in Ethiopia who have been orphaned by AIDS and are HIV positive.  &quot;AIDS is chronic and manageable, and does NOT have to kill any longer,&quot; said Jolie.  She also announced her plan to support WWO's Paediatric HIV/AIDS Clinic in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and pledged an initial grant.  The gala helped the organisation raise $800,000.  Dr. Jane Aronson, the organisation's founder, and Ms. Jolie first met through the adoption of her daughter Zahara and Jolie credits the doctor with helping save her daughter's life.

==Adoptions==
On March 10, 2002 Jolie adopted her first child, Maddox Chivan Jolie. He was born on [[August 5]], [[2001]] as Rath Vibol in [[Cambodia]].  He was being housed in a Cambodian orphanage when Angelina Jolie saw him for the first time there in a production break for the film ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''.  
After her divorce from her second husband [[Billy Bob Thornton]], Jolie received sole custody for Maddox.

In the autumn of [[2004]], it was reported that Jolie had started proceedings to adopt another child, this time from [[Russia]]. However, no adoption ever took place.  On March 8, Jolie took part in a Washington Press club luncheon.[http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/news/opendoc.htm?tbl=NEWS&amp;id=422f33944] 

It was there that she announced the founding of the  National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children in Washington, D.C., an organisation that provides free legal-aid to children who prior to this had no legal representation.  Jolie donated $500,000 to the centre which will help keep it afloat for the first two years of its operation.  At that same conference she stated that she never intended to adopt a Russian orphan boy.  Jolie expressed a deep sadness at the media's exploitation of the child. She stated that she was on business through the United Nations and not looking for a child to adopt.  She also mentioned that her son wanted an &quot;African brother or sister&quot; because of his love of Africa and the work he knows she does in that region. 

Around the same time, Lauryn Galindo, the [[Hawaii]]-based adoption facilitator whose services Jolie had used to adopt Maddox, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to [[visa (document)|visa]] fraud and [[money laundering]] charges.  She had been falsifying records of children to be adopted in visa applications to the [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]], and several of the children she placed had not been abandoned at all but were enticed away or bought from their birth families.  There is no evidence that Maddox was among them, although the investigation is continuing.  Maddox Jolie, as he is legally named, was naturalised as a United States citizen some time ago, and there is no indication that that will be rescinded.

On [[July 5]], 2005, [[People magazine]] reported that Jolie was in the final stages of adopting a baby girl, who was orphaned by AIDS, from [[Ethiopia]], through the agency [[Wide Horizons for Children]]. Jolie has named her daughter Zahara Marley Jolie.  A woman in London has been claiming she is Zahara's birth mother since August 2005.  Ms. Jolie has contacted a lawyer in London to look into the matter.

On [[September 28]], [[2005]] while making an appearance to discuss America's financial involvement in fighting AIDS globally on CNN's &quot;[[The Situation Room]]&quot; with [[Wolf Blitzer]], Jolie stated that her daughter is an &quot;AIDS orphan&quot;.  By that she means her birth mother died from the disease but her daughter does not have the disease.  The birth father of Zahara is not known.  Her statement made it clear that the birth mother is indeed dead.  In late October [[2005]], an Ethiopian judge ruled that there is no evidence to suggest that Ms. Jolie would have to file for re-adoption of her daughter Zahara Marley Jolie.  The judge ruled that the woman claiming to be her mother is not the birth mother.  Earlier in the summer, another woman had come forward claiming to be the grandmother of Zahara.  That claim also proved to be false.

American magazine ''[[Us (magazine)|US Weekly]]'' indicated erroneously that Jolie and [[Brad Pitt]] had adopted Zahara together. When the magazine realised its error, the presses were stopped and an apology issued to Jolie and Pitt; printing of the issue resumed with the correction made, though a number of copies with the error were still released to the public.  Reportedly, however, Pitt was present when Jolie signed the adoption papers.  The agency later said Brad Pitt was not present when Angelina Jolie picked up her daughter. [http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2005-07-08/]

In [[December]] [[2005]] however , it was confirmed that Pitt was seeking to legally adopt Jolie's two children. In support of this bid (and as part of legal requirements), Jolie took out [[Classified advertising|classified advertisements]] in the [[Los Angeles]] paper, the ''[[Daily Commerce]]'', announcing the name change request, and on January 19, 2006, a judge in California approved this request.  The children's legal surnames were formally changed to Jolie-Pitt. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10927183/]

==Tattoos==
[[Image:tigertattooo.jpg|thumb|right|Jolie showing off her largest tattoo, a tiger on her lower back]]
Jolie's inventory of tattoos has become the subject of much media attention, and she frequently adds or even changes existing tattoos. She has said that all the tattoos she possesses have a special meaning. Her tattoos include:

*the letter [[H]] (for her brother [[James Haven]]) on the inside of her left wrist.
*&quot;A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages&quot; ([[Tennessee Williams]]) on her left forearm.
*a large prayer for her son Maddox on her left shoulder which covers up the Chinese &quot;death&quot; tattoo.
*two pointy black tribals on the lower parts of her back.
*''Quod me nutrit me destruit'' ([[Latin]] for &quot;What nourishes me also destroys me&quot;) several inches below her navel.
*a tilted [[Latin cross]] on the lower left of her abdomen.
*a large Asian tiger on her back.
*a dragon under the tiger.
*XIII (number 13 in [[Roman numerals]]) on her left forearm.
* [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for &quot;strength of will.&quot; (العزيمة) on her right forearm.
*&quot;know your rights&quot; just under her neck between her shoulders.

Lasered/Covered:
*a dragon on her left arm (she has been lasering it for some months now but it can still be faintly seen).
*&quot;Billy Bob&quot;, the name of her former husband [[Billy Bob Thornton]], on her left arm (like the dragon, it is still somewhat visible despite having been in the process of removal for a long time).
*a Chinese character for courage now covered by the Tennessee Williams quote.
*a Chinese character for death (死) now covered by the prayer for her son.
*a tattoo both Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina had a copy of. It was on her right forearm, now covered by the &quot;strength of will&quot; tattoo.
*a dragon she got in Amsterdam while drunk, now covered by the latin cross.
*a window on her lower back.  On 'Inside the Actors Studio', she explained that she covered this tattoo, because, while she used to spend all of her time staring through windows wishing to be outside, she now lives there all of the time.

Jolie has gone on record as saying that a positive effect resulting from the large number of tattoos on her body is that, while she is not opposed to film nudity, filmmakers have been forced to become more creative when plotting any nude or love scenes involving her. Make-up has been used to cover up the tattoos in productions such as the ''Tomb Raider'' films, ''Alexander'', and ''Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith''.

==Academy Awards==
*1999 - Best Supporting Actress - &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;

==Other trivia==
* She has said that she is [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and once claimed to have been in love with fashion model [[Jenny Shimizu]], her co-star in the film ''Foxfire''.  &quot;I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband.  I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.&quot;
* She is [[left-handed]].
* She wears an American-size 9 shoe.
* Jolie once described herself as &quot;most likely to sleep with a female fan&quot;.
* She speaks &quot;very little [[French language|French]]&quot; according to her book [[Notes from My Travels]].
* The name Angelina actually means &quot;little angel&quot; in [[Italian language|Italian]].  Jolie in French means &quot;pretty&quot;.
* She drives a black, Ford truck.
* She has a civilian pilot's licence.
* She collects knives and has interest in mortuary science.
* She was born at 9:09 a.m. in Los Angeles.
* Her uncle, [[Chip Taylor]], wrote the songs ''[[Wild Thing]]'' and ''[[Angel of the Morning]].
* She claims to have a fondness for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool Football Club]], having revealed that her baby son, Maddox, &quot;only wants to play for Liverpool&quot; after he was admitted to Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool for treatment.
* She has continually denied rumours of an [[incest]]uous relationship with her brother, [[James Haven]].  During her acceptance speech for winning the [[Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] award for ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' during the [[72nd Academy Awards|2000 Academy Awards]], Jolie stated &quot;I'm so in love with my brother right now&quot; which, combined with her affectionate behaviour towards her brother that night, sparked the rumours.  On ''[[Inside the Actor's Studio]]'' she stated that she never had an incestuous relationship with her brother, stating that &quot;the world is a lot sicker than I thought&quot;, in reference to the conclusion everyone jumped to.  Also, in an interview with  ''[[People Magazine]]'' she and her brother stated that, being children of divorcees, they relied on one another and because of that they hold on to each other as a means of emotional support.  Jolie has starred in five student films directed by her brother.
* In October 2005, ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' tabloid in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], as well as several American entertainment news programmes reported that Jolie was in the running to appear with her ''Lara Croft: Tomb Raider'' co-star [[Daniel Craig]] in the next [[James Bond]] film, ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. This ultimately proved to be a false report.
* In a December 2001 Rolling Stone interview, Jolie said: &quot;My favorite book [of the year] was [[Loung Ung]]'s First They Killed My Father, about her childhood in Cambodia. I spent some time with her in Cambodia when I was there with [[UNHCR]], and she's wonderful.&quot;  On Loung Ung's website, Jolie is quoted: &quot;I encourage everyone to read this deeply moving and very important book ([[Lucky Child]]). Equal to the strength of the book, is the woman who wrote it. She is a voice for her people and they are lucky to have her.&quot;
* She hasn't stated definitively whether or not she believes in God or what religion she practices. When asked in an interview with ''The Onion A.V. Club''&lt;!--EDITORS: this publication is authentic and *not* satire, please read: http://www.avclub.com/content/about--&gt; if there was a God, she said &quot;For some people. I hope so, for them. For the people who believe in it, I hope so. There doesn't need to be a God for me. There's something in people that's spiritual, that's godlike. I don't feel like doing things just because people say things, but I also don't really know if it's better to just not believe in anything, either.&quot; She is sometimes thought to be a [[Buddhist]], but Jolie says that she teaches Buddhism to her son Maddox because she considers it part of his culture. She added a tattoo of Buddhist [[Sanskrit]] symbols on her shoulder as a prayer for him.[http://www.usatoday.com/life/2003-07-17-jolie-side_x.htm][http://www.asianconnections.com/a/?article_id=123][http://www.religionfacts.com/celebrities/angelina_jolie.htm][http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/J/Jolie_Angelina/2003/10/19/759420.html][http://www.avclub.com/content/node/24504]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anton '''(or '''Antonio''')''' Diabelli''' ([[September 6]], [[1781]]-[[April 7]], [[1858]]) was an [[Austria]]n [[music]] publisher, editor and [[composer]]. Best known in his time as a publisher, he is most familiar today as the composer of the [[waltz]] on which [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] wrote his set of thirty-three ''[[Diabelli Variations]]''.

Diabelli was born in [[Mattsee]] near [[Salzburg]]. He was trained to enter the [[priest]]hood, but also took music lessons with [[Michael Haydn]]. He moved to [[Vienna]] to teach the [[piano]] and [[guitar]] before becoming partners with  [[Pietro Cappi]] in 1818 and setting up a music publishing firm with him.

The firm, Cappi &amp; Diabelli (which became Diabelli &amp; Co. in 1824) became well known by [[arrangement|arranging]] popular pieces so they could be played by amateurs at home. The firm became well known in more serious music circles by becoming the first to publish works by [[Franz Schubert]], a composer the firm later championed.

Diabelli produced a modest number of works as a composer, including an [[operetta]] called ''Adam in der Klemme'', a number of [[mass (music)|mass]]es and [[song]]s and a large number of piano and classical guitar pieces. Among these are pieces for four hands (two pianists playing at one piano), which are popular amongst amateur pianists.

Ironically, perhaps, the composition for which Diabelli is now best known was actually written as part of a publishing venture. In 1819, he decided to try to publish a volume of [[variation (music)|variation]]s on a waltz he had penned expressly for this purpose, with one variation by every important Austrian composer living at the time, as well as several significant non-Austrians. Fifty composers responded with pieces, including Schubert, [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]]. [[Carl Czerny]] was enlisted to write a [[coda (music)|coda]], and they were published as ''[[Vaterländische Künstlerverein]]''.

Beethoven, however, instead of providing just one variation, provided thirty-three, and his were published in a volume of their own in 1824. They constitute what is generally regarded as one of the greatest of Beethoven's piano pieces and as the greatest set of variations of their time, and are generally known simply as the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]''.

Diabelli's publishing house expanded throughout his life, before he retired in 1851, leaving it under the control of [[Carl Anton Spina]]. When Diabelli died in 1858, Spina continued to run the firm, and published much music by [[Johann Strauss II]] and [[Josef Strauss]]. In 1872, the firm was taken over by [[Friedrich Schreiber]], and in 1876 it merged with the firm of [[August Cranz]], who bought the company in 1879 and ran it under his name.

[[Image:A_Hill.jpg|thumb|Anita Hill]]
'''Anita F. Hill''' (born [[July 30]], [[1956]]) was a colleague of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] prior to Thomas' appointment to the Supreme Court. Hill became a public figure when she accused Thomas of [[sexual harassment]] and using coarse language during his [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmation hearing.

Hill was born in [[Lone Tree, Oklahoma|Lone Tree]], [[Oklahoma]]. She received her undergraduate degree from [[Oklahoma State University]] in [[1977]], and her [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Yale Law School|Yale University]] in [[1980]]. Upon graduation from law school, she became a practicing lawyer with the [[Washington, D.C.]], firm of Ward, Hardraker, and Ross. In [[1981]], she met Thomas, and became his assistant at the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]]. It was during this period, according to Hill's later testimony, that the alleged sexual harassment took place. When Thomas became chairman of the U.S. [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], Hill followed him to this new job, joining the Commission's legal staff. 

When Thomas was nominated to the Supreme Court in [[1991]], Hill's accusations to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] that Thomas had used coarse language with her were leaked to the media by Democrats on the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]]. Hill, by then on the law school faculty at the [[University of Oklahoma]], testified before the committee about Thomas's alleged verbal harassment (including a claim that he made a joke about finding a [[pubic hair]] in a can of [[Coca-Cola]]). Thomas made a blanket denial of the accusations, and, after extensive debate, the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] narrowly confirmed Thomas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cleanup-date|December 2005}}

An '''audio file format''' is a [[container format]] for storing [[Sound|audio]] data on a [[computer]] system.  There are many file formats for storing audio files.

The general approach towards storing digital audio formats is to [[sample (signal)|sample]] the audio voltage (corresponding to a certain position in the membrane of a speaker) in regular intervals (e.g. 44,100 times per second for [[CDDA]] or 48,000 or 96,000 times per second for [[DVD]] video) and store the value with a certain resolution (e.g. 16 bits per sample in CDDA). Therefore [[sample rate]], [[resolution]] and number of channels (e.g. 2 for stereo) are key parameters in audio file formats.

It is important to distinguish between a [[file format]] and a [[codec]]. Even though most audio file formats support only one [[audio codec]], a file format may support multiple codecs, as [[AVI]] does.

There are three major groups of audio file formats:

* uncompressed formats, such as [[WAV]], [[AIFF]] and [[Au file format|AU]].
* formats with [[lossless data compression|lossless]] compression, such as [[FLAC]], [[Monkey's Audio]] ([[filename extension]] APE), [[WavPack]], [[SHN|Shorten]], [[TTA]], [[Apple Lossless]] and lossless [[Windows Media Audio]] (WMA).
* formats with [[lossy data compression|lossy]] compression, such as [[MP3]], [[Vorbis]] (filename extension OGG), lossy [[Windows Media Audio]] (WMA) and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]].

Lossy file formats are based on [[psychoacoustic model]]s that leave out sounds that humans cannot or can hardly hear, e.g. a low volume sound after a big volume sound. [[MP3]] is such an example.

Lossless audio formats (such as [[TTA]]) provide compression about 2:1, but no data/quality is lost in the compression - when uncompressed, the data will be identical to the original. Lossless audio codecs are a good choice to keep the music's original quality. For example, using the free [[TTA]] lossless audio codec you can store up to 20 audio CDs from your music collection on one single DVD-R for playback.

As of [[2002]], one of the most popular audio file formats was [[MP3]], which uses the [[MPEG-1]] audio layer 3 codec to provide acceptable lossy compression for music files. The compression is about 10:1 compared with uncompressed WAV files (in a standard compression scheme), therefore a [[CD]] with MP3 files can store about 10 hours of music, compared to one hour of the standard [[CDDA]], which uses uncompressed PCM.

There are many newer audio formats and codecs claiming to achieve improved compression and quality over MP3. [[Vorbis]] is an [[software patent|unpatented]], [[free software|free]] codec. Microsoft has its [[Windows Media Audio]] format.

[[Audio data compression#Lossless Compression|Lossless compression]] of sound is not nearly as widely used outside of professional applications, as lossy compression can provide a much greater [[data compression ratio]] with nearly the same [[transparency (data compression)|apparent quality]].

There are many uncompressed data formats, the most popular of them being [[WAV]], which is a flexible file format designed to store multiple types of audio data.  It is a good file format for storing and archiving an original recording, though less so than losslessly compressed formats, for it encodes all sounds, whether complex or absolutely silent, with the same number of bits. The WAV format is based on the [[RIFF]] file format, which is similar to the [[Interchange File Format|IFF]] format.

[[BWF]] (Broadcast Wave Format) is a standard audio format created by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] as a successor to WAV. BWF allows [[metadata]] to be stored in the file. See: European Broadcasting Union: Specification of the Broadcast Wave Format - A format for audio data files in broadcasting. EBU Technical document 3285, July [[1997]]. This format is the primary recording format used in many professional Audio Workstations used in the Television and Film industry. Stand-alone file based multi-track recorders from [http://www.sounddevices.com Sound Devices], [http://www.zaxcom.com Zaxcom], [http://www.hhb.co.uk/hhb/usa/ HHB USA], [http://fostex.com  Fostex], and [http://aaton.com Aaton] all use BWF as their preferred file format for recording multi-track audio files with SMPTE Time Code reference.  This standardized Time Stamp in the Broadcast Wave File allows for easy synchronization with a separate picture element. 

Since the [[1990s]], movie theatres have upgraded their sound systems to [[surround sound]] systems that carry more than two channels. The most popular examples are [[Advanced Audio Coding]] or AAC (used by [[Apple_Computer|Apple]]&amp;nbsp;'s [[iTunes]]) and [[Dolby Digital]], also known as AC-3. Both codecs are copyrighted and encoders/decoders cannot be offered without paying a licence fee. The most popular multi-channel format is called 5.1, with 5 ''normal'' channels (front left, front middle, front right, back left, back right) and a [[subwoofer]] channel to carry low frequencies only (the human ear cannot distinguish where the low frequencies come from).

It is a common misconception that 5.1 Surround sound includes 2 rear speakers.  In fact, a 5.1 setup includes what Dolby call Surround speakers, and are actually placed at the sides of the listener. [http://www.dolby.com/consumer/home_entertainment/roomlayout.html] &amp;nbsp;  
&quot;6.1&quot; setups do however, include a single rear speaker placed at the rear centre, behind the listener - Dolby calls this setup Dolby Digital EX .[http://www.dolby.com/resources/tech_library/index.cfm] &amp;nbsp; 
A 7.1 setup has the usual front 3 (front Left, front Centre, front Right), 2 Surround sound speakers situated to the left and right of the listener, and 2 rear speakers (rear Left and rear Right); with the usual Sub-woofer for bass - Dolby call this .1 / Sub speaker by the term LFE (Low-Frequency Effects).

'''Audio compression''' is a form of [[data compression]] designed to reduce the size of audio data files.  Audio compression algorithms are typically referred to as ''audio [[codec]]s''.  As  with other specific forms of data compression, there exist many &quot;[[Lossless data compression|lossless]]&quot; and &quot;[[Lossy data compression|lossy]]&quot; algorithms to achieve the compression effect.

== Lossless compression ==

As with [[image compression]], both lossy and lossless compression algorithms are used in audio compression.  As file storage and communications bandwidth have become less expensive and more available, the popularity of lossless formats such as [[FLAC]] has increased sharply, as people are choosing to maintain a permanent archive of their audio files. The primary users of lossless compression are [[audio engineer|audio engineers]], audiophiles and those consumers who want to preserve the full quality of their audio files, in contrast to the quality loss from lossy compression techniques such as [[Vorbis]] and [[MP3]].  Of course, virtually every user will use both schemes for some files, or maintain both lossy and lossless versions, as their needs require.

It is difficult to maintain all the data in an audio stream and achieve substantial compression.  First, the vast majority of sound recordings are highly complex and random, recorded from the real world.  As one of the key methods of compression is to find patterns and repetition, more random data such as audio doesn't compress well.  In a similar manner, [[photo]]graphs compress less efficiently with lossless methods than simpler computer-generated images do.  But interestingly, even computer generated sounds can contain very complicated [[waveform]]s that present a challenge to many compression algorithms.  This is due to the nature of audio waveforms, which are generally difficult to simplify without a (necessarily lossy) conversion to frequency information, as performed by the human ear.

The second reason is that values of audio [[sample (signal)|sample]]s change very quickly, so generic data compression [[algorithm]]s don't work well for audio, and strings of consecutive bytes don't generally appear very often.  However, [[convolution]] with the filter [-1 1] (that is, taking the first difference) tends to slightly [[white noise|whiten]] ([[decorrelate]], make flat) the spectrum, thereby allowing traditional lossless compression at the encoder to do its job; integration at the decoder restores the original signal.  Codecs such as [[FLAC]], [[Shorten]] and [[TTA]] use [[linear prediction]] to [[List_of_digital_estimation_techniques|estimate]] the spectrum of the signal.  At the encoder, the estimator's inverse is used to whiten the signal by removing spectral peaks while the estimator is used to reconstruct the original signal at the decoder.

Lossless audio codecs have no quality issues, so the usability can be estimated by
* Speed of compression and decompression
* Degree of compression
* Software and hardware support

== Lossy compression ==

Lossy audio compression is used in an extremely wide range of applications.  In addition to the direct applications (mp3 players or computers), digitally compressed audio streams are used in most video DVDs; digital television; streaming media on the [[internet]]; satellite and cable radio; and increasingly in terrestrial radio broadcasts.   Lossy compression typically achieves far greater compression than lossless compression (data of 5-20% of the original stream, rather than 50-60%), by simplifying the complexities of the data.  Given that bandwidth and storage are always limited, the trade-off of reduced audio quality is clearly outweighed for some applications where users wish to transmit or store more information.  (For example, one can fit a lot more songs on their iPod using lossy than using lossless compression; and a DVD might hold several audio tracks using lossy compression in the space needed for one lossless audio track.)

In both lossy and lossless compression, information redundancy is reduced, using methods such as coding, pattern recognition and linear prediction to reduce the amount of information used to describe the data.  For example, suppose you wanted to record twenty house numbers along one side of a street, each of which goes up by 2.  If the first address was 14461, or five digits, the uncompressed stream would require 20 times 5 bytes, or 100 bytes, to store.  You could recode that to take advantage of the repetition and simply say begin at 14461, increase by 2, repeat 19 times.  Now the data are losslessly captured in just 8 bytes!

The innovation of lossy audio compression was to use [[psychoacoustics]] to recognize that not all data in an audio stream is perceived by the human ear.  Most lossy compression reduces perceptual redundancy by first identifying sounds which are considered perceptually irrelevant, that is, sounds that are very hard to hear.  Typical examples include high frequencies, or sounds that occur at the same time as other louder sounds.   Those sounds are coded with decreased accuracy or not coded at all.

To illustrate this by continuing with the example, suppose the data were more complex, so the difference between two house numbers was 4 in one instance, between the tenth and eleventh houses.  Lossless coding would require something like this: begin at 14461, increase by 2, repeat 9 times, increase by 4, increase by 2, repeat 8 times.  So 10, rather than 8 bytes, are needed to store the data.  But if your model of lossy compression determines that difference was not relevant for the application, it might simplify the data to ignore the variation and increase the compression.  However, some data are lost in the process, because the original data cannot be reconstructed from the lossy compression scheme; only an approximation of that data, determined to be sufficient for this application, can be recovered.

If reducing perceptual redundancy does not achieve sufficient compression for a particular application, it may require further lossy compression with a difference in quality that can be more readily perceived by a user.  Most lossy compression schemes allow compression parameters to be adjusted to achieve a target rate of data, usually expressed as a [[bit rate]].  Again, the data reduction will be guided by some model of how important the sound is as perceived by the human ear, with the goal of efficiency and optimized quality for the target data rate.  (There are many different models used for this perceptual analysis, some better suited to different types of audio than others.)  Hence, depending on the bandwidth and storage requirements, the use of lossy compression may result in a perceived reduction of the audio quality that ranges from none to severe.  Of course, that trade-off is usually intentional.

Because data are removed during lossy compression and cannot be recovered by decompression, lossy compression schemes are completely unsuitable for archival storage.  Hence, as noted, even those who use lossy compression (for portable audio applications, for example) may keep a losslessly compressed archive for other applications.  In addition, the technology of compression continues to advance, and achieving a state-of-the-art lossy compression would require one to begin again with the lossless, original audio data and compress with the new lossy codec.   The nature of lossy compression (for both audio and images) results in increasing degradation of quality if data are decompressed, then recompressed using lossy compression.  For these and other reasons, lossy compression is not appropriate for many audio applications.

===Coding methods===

====Transform domain methods====
In order to determine what information in an audio signal is perceptual irrelevant, most lossy compression algorithms use transforms such as the [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) to convert [[time domain]] sampled waveforms into a transform domain.  Once transformed, typically into the [[frequency domain]], component frequencies can be allocated bits according to how audible they are.  Audibility of spectral components is determined by first calculating a [[masking threshold]], below which it is estimated that sounds will be beyond the limits of human perception.

The masking threshold is calculated using the [[absolute threshold of hearing]] and the principles of [[simultaneous masking]] - the phenomenon wherein a signal is masked by another signal separated by frequency - and, in some cases, [[temporal masking]] - where a signal is masked by another signal separated by time.  [[Equal-loudness contour]]s may also be used to weight the perceptual importance of different components.  Models of the human ear-brain combination incorporating such effects are often called  [[psychoacoustic model]]s.

====Time domain methods====
Other types of lossy compressors, such as the [[linear predictive coding]] (LPC) used with speech, are ''source-based coders''.  These coders use a model of the sound's generator (such as the human vocal tract with LPC) to whiten the audio signal (i.e., flatten its spectrum) prior to quantization.  LPC may also be thought of as a basic perceptual coding technique; reconstruction of an audio signal using a linear predictor shapes the coder's quantization noise into the spectrum of the target signal, partially masking it.

===Applications===
Due to the nature of lossy algorithms, [[audio quality]] suffers when a file is decompressed and recompressed (generational losses).  This makes lossy-compressed files unsuitable for professional audio engineering applications, such as sound editing and multitrack recording. However, they are very popular with end users (particularly [[MP3]]), as a megabyte can store about a minute's worth of music at adequate quality.

===Usability===
Usability of lossy audio codecs is determined by:
* Perceived audio quality
* Compression factor
* Speed of compression and decompression
* Inherent latency of algorithm (critical for real-time streaming applications; see below)
* Software and hardware support

Lossy formats are often used for the distribution of streaming audio, or interactive applications (such as the coding of speech for digital transmission in cell phone networks).  In such applications, the data must be decompressed as the data flows, rather than after the entire data stream has been transmitted.  Not all audio codecs can be used for streaming applications, and for such applications a codec designed to stream data effectively will usually be chosen.

Latency results from the methods used to encode and decode the data.  Some codecs will analyze a longer segment of the data to optimize efficiency, and then code it in a manner that requires a larger segment of data at one time in order to decode.  (Often codecs create segments called a &quot;frame&quot; to create discrete data segments for encoding and decoding.)   The inherent [[latency]] of the coding algorithm can be critical; for example, when there is two-way transmission of data, such as with a telephone conversation, significant delays may seriously degrade the perceived quality.

In contrast to the speed of compression, which is proportional to the number of operations required by the algorithm, here latency refers to the number of samples which must be analysed before a block of audio is processed.  In the minimum case, latency is 0 zero samples (e.g., if the coder/decoder simply reduces the number of bits used to quantize the signal).  Time domain algorithms such as LPC also often have low latencies, hence their popularity in speech coding for telephony.  In algorithms such as MP3, however, a large number of samples have to be analyzed in order to implement a psychoacoustic model in the frequency domain, and latency is on the order of 23 ms (46 ms for two-way communication).

=== Speech encoding ===

[[Speech encoding]] is an important category of audio data compression.  The perceptual models used to estimate what a human ear can hear are generally somewhat different from those used for music.  The range of frequencies needed to convey the sounds of a human voice are normally far narrower than that needed for music, and the sound is normally less complex.  As a result, speech can be encoded at high quality using relatively low bit rates.

This is accomplished, in general, by some combination of two approaches:
* Only encoding sounds that could be made by a single human voice.
* Throwing away more of the data in the signal -- keeping just enough to reconstruct an &quot;intelligible&quot; voice rather than the full frequency range of human [[hearing (sense)|hearing]].

Perhaps the earliest algorithms used in speech encoding (and audio data compression in general) were the [[A-law algorithm]] and the [[mu-law algorithm]].

[[Image:Area 51 28 August 1968 6.jpg|thumb|Satellite view of Area 51 from 1968.]]
'''Area 51''' (also known as '''Dreamland''', '''Watertown''', '''The Ranch''', '''Paradise Ranch''', '''The Farm''', '''The Box''', '''Groom Lake''', and '''The Directorate for Development Plans Area''') is a remote tract of land in southern [[Nevada]], owned by the [[federal government of the United States]], containing an airfield apparently used for the secret development and testing of new military aircraft. It is famed as the subject of many [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO conspiracy theories]].

== Geography ==
[[Image:Wfm area51 map en.png|thumb|left|Map showing Area 51, NAFR, and the NTS]]
Area 51 is a section of land of approximately 60 square miles (155 [[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]]) in [[Lincoln County, Nevada]], [[United States|USA]].  It is part of the vast (4,687 square mile [12,139 km&amp;sup2;]) [[Nellis Air Force Range]] (NAFR).  The area consists largely of the wide Emigrant Valley, framed by the Groom and Papoose mountain ranges (to the North and South respectively) and the Jumbled Hills to the East.  Between the two ranges lies Groom Dry Lake ({{coor dms|37|16|05|N|115|47|58|W|}}), a dry [[endorheic|alkali lake]] bed roughly three miles (5 km) in diameter. A large air base exists on the southwest corner of the lake ({{coor dm|37|14|N|115|49|W|}}) with two concrete runways, one of which extends onto the lake bed, and four unprepared runways on the lake bed itself.  

High-resolution satellite images have shed some light on the facility's complex runway layouts.  Area 51 has two operating runways, the main is 14L/32R, a concrete runway constructed in the 1990s, measuring 11,980 x 200 feet (3,651 x 61 m) with a 1000 x 100 feet (304 x 30 m) overrun at each end and the secondary, shorter runway is 12/30 which also doubles as a taxiway, measuring 5,420ft x 150 feet (1,652m x 45m).  The older runway is exactly six miles (9,656 m) long.  It is composed of 12,500 feet of concrete, 11,080 feet of asphalt, and 5560 feet and 2540 feet of now dismantled asphalt on the north and south ends respectively.  At least three sets of old runway markings are found, suggesting that the full six-mile length was probably never used in its entirety.  Currently only a 6,600 feet (2011 m) stretch of the concrete section is marked for use, forming runway 14R/32L.  The dirt lakebed runways, comprising two twin airstrips, measure up to 11,270 feet (3435 m) in length and 100 to 170 feet (30 to 52 m) in width.

Area 51 shares a border with the Yucca Flats region of the [[Nevada Test Site]] (NTS), the location of many of the U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy's]] [[nuclear weapons]] tests.  The [[Yucca Mountain]] nuclear storage facility is approximately 40 miles (64km) southwest of Groom Lake.

The designation &quot;Area 51&quot; is somewhat contentious, appearing on older maps of the NTS but not newer ones, but the same naming scheme is used for other parts of the Nevada Test Site.

The area is connected to the internal NTS road network, with paved roads leading both to Mercury to the northwest and west to Yucca Flats.  Leading northeast from the lake, Groom Lake Road (a wide, well-conditioned dirt road) runs through a pass in the Jumbled Hills.  Groom Lake Road was formerly the track leading to mines in the Groom basin, but has been improved since their closure. Its winding course takes it past a security checkpoint, but the restricted area around the base extends further east than this (unauthorized visitors who travel west on Groom Lake Road are usually observed first by guards located on the hills surrounding the pass, still several miles from the checkpoint).  After leaving the restricted area (marked by numerous warning signs stating that &quot;photography is prohibited&quot; and that &quot;use of deadly force is authorized&quot;) Groom Lake Road descends eastward to the floor of the Tikaboo Valley, passing the dirt-road entrances to several small ranches, before joining with [[Nevada State Route 375]], the &quot;Extraterrestrial Highway&quot;, south of [[Rachel, Nevada|Rachel]].

== Operations at Groom Lake ==
Groom Lake is not a conventional airbase, and frontline units are not normally deployed there.  It appears, rather, to be used during the development, test and training phases for new aircraft.  Once those aircraft have been accepted by the [[United States Air Force]], operation of that aircraft is generally shifted to a normal air force base.  Groom is reported, however, to be the permanent home for a small number of aircraft of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] design (obtained by various means).  These are reportedly analyzed and used for training purposes. 

Soviet spy satellites obtained photographs of the Groom Lake area during the height of the Cold War, but these support only modest conclusions about the base. They depict a nondescript base, airstrip, hangars, and so forth, but nothing that supports some of the wilder claims about underground facilities.  Later commercial satellite images show that the base has grown, but remains superficially unexceptional.

=== Senior Year/U-2 program ===
Groom Lake was used for bombing and artillery practice during [[World War II]], but was then abandoned until 1955, when it was selected by [[Lockheed]]'s [[skunkworks]] team as the ideal location to test the forthcoming [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane. The lakebed made for an ideal strip to operate the troublesome test aircraft from, and the Emigrant Valley's mountain ranges and the NTS perimeter protected the secret plane from curious eyes.

Lockheed constructed a makeshift base at Groom, little more than a few shelters and workshops and a small constellation of trailer homes in which to billet its small team.  The first U-2 flew at Groom in August 1955, and U-2s under the control of the [[CIA]] began overflights of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] territory by mid-1956.

During this period, the NTS continued to perform a series of atmospheric nuclear explosions.  U-2 operations throughout 1957 were frequently disrupted by the [[Operation Plumbbob|Plumbbob]] series of atomic tests, which exploded over two dozen devices at the NTS.  The Plumbbob-Hood explosion on [[July 5]] scattered [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] across Groom and forced its (temporary) evacuation.

As the U-2's primary mission was to overfly the Soviet Union, it operated largely from airbases near the Soviet border, including [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]] in [[Turkey]] and [[Peshawar]] in [[Pakistan]].

=== Blackbird (OXCART/A-10/A-11/A-12/SR-71) program ===
Even before U-2 development was complete, Lockheed began work on its successor, the [[CIA]]'s ''OXCART'' project, a [[Mach number|Mach]]-3 high altitude [[reconnaissance]] aircraft later known as the [[SR-71 Blackbird]].  The Blackbird's flight characteristics and maintenance requirements forced a massive expansion of facilities and runways at Groom Lake.  By the time the first A-12 Blackbird prototype flew at Groom in 1962, the main runway had been lengthened to 8500 ft (2600 m), and the base boasted a complement of over 1000 personnel.  It had fueling tanks, a control tower, and a [[baseball]] diamond.  Security was also greatly enhanced, the small civilian mine in the Groom basin was closed, and the area surrounding the valley was made an exclusive military preserve (where interlopers were subject to &quot;lethal force&quot;).  Groom saw the first flight of all major Blackbird variants: A-10, A-11, A-12, RS-71 (renamed [[SR-71]] by USAF Chief of Staff [[Curtis LeMay]] and not by a presidential error as popularly believed), the abortive YF-12A strike-fighter variant, and the disastrous D-21 Blackbird-based drone project.

=== Have Blue/Senior Trend/F-117 program ===
The first [[Have Blue]] prototype stealth fighter (a smaller cousin of the [[F-117 Nighthawk]]) first flew at Groom in late 1977.  Testing of a series of ultra-secret prototypes continued there until mid-1981, when testing transitioned to the initial production of F-117 stealth fighters.  In addition to flight testing, Groom performed radar profiling, F-117 weapons testing, and was the location for training of the first group of frontline USAF F-117 pilots.  Subsequently active-service F-117 operations (still highly classified) moved to the nearby [[Tonopah Test Range]] and finally to [[Holloman Air Force Base]].

=== Later operations ===
[[Image:Area 51.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Simulated aerial view of Area 51, made using [[Landsat]] imagery]]
Since the F-117 became operational in 1983, operations at Groom Lake have continued unabated.  The base and its associated runway system have been expanded, and the daily flights bringing civilian commuters from Las Vegas continue.  Some commentators, after examining recent satellite photos of the base, estimate it to have a live-in complement of over 1000 people, with a similar number commuting from Las Vegas.  In 1995 the federal government expanded the exclusionary area around the base to include nearby mountains that had hitherto afforded the only decent overlook of the base. Subsequently, limited views of the area are available only from the summits of several distant mountains, particularly Tikaboo Peak ({{coor dms|37|20|40|N|115|21|32|W|}}), around 26 miles (42 km) to the east.

Aircraft that have supposedly been tested at Groom include the [[Northrop Tacit Blue]] stealth demonstrator, various classified [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s, a small stealthy [[VTOL]] troop-transport aircraft, a stealthy [[cruise missile]], the rumored [[Aurora aircraft|Aurora]] [[hypersonic]] spy plane, a &quot;[[Stealth Blimp]]&quot;, and replacements for the SR-71 and F-117A.

== Area 51 commuters ==
[[Image:Wfm tc janet at mccarran.jpg|thumb|right|300px|EG&amp;G JANET 737s at McCarran.]]
Defense contractor [[EG&amp;G]] maintains a private terminal at [[McCarran International Airport]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].  A number of unmarked aircraft operate daily shuttle services from McCarran to sites operated by EG&amp;G in the extensive federally controlled lands in southern Nevada.   These aircraft reportedly use JANET radio call signs (e.g., &quot;JANET 6&quot;), said to be an acronym for &quot;Joint Air Network for Employee Transportation&quot; or (perhaps as a joke) &quot;Just Another Non-Existent Terminal&quot;.  EG&amp;G advertises in the Las Vegas press for experienced airline pilots, saying applicants must be eligible for government security clearance and that successful applicants can expect to always overnight at Las Vegas.  These aircraft, painted white with red trim (the livery of now defunct [[Western Airlines]]), include [[Boeing 737]]s and several smaller executive jets.  Their tail numbers are registered to several unexceptional civil aircraft leasing corporations.  They are reported to shuttle to Groom, [[Tonopah Test Range]], to other locations in the NAFR and NTS, and reportedly to [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake]].  Observers counting departures and cars in the private EG&amp;G parking lot at McCarran estimate several thousand people commute on JANET each day.  

A bus runs a commuter service along Groom Lake Road, catering to a small number of employees living in several small desert communities beyond the NTS boundary (although it is not clear whether these workers are employed at Groom or at other facilities in the NTS).  The bus drives down Groom Lake Road and stops at [[Crystal Springs, Nevada|Crystal Springs]], [[Ash Springs, Nevada|Ash Springs]], and [[Alamo, Nevada|Alamo]], and parks in front of the Alamo court house overnight.

== The Government's position on Area 51 ==
[[Image:Wfm x51 area51 warningsign.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Area 51 border and warning sign.  &quot;Camo dudes&quot; in their vehicle watch from the ridgeline.]] 
The U.S. government does not explicitly acknowledge the existence of the Groom Lake facility, nor does it deny it.  Unlike much of the Nellis range, the area surrounding the lake is permanently off-limits both to civilian and normal military air traffic.  The area is protected by radar stations, and uninvited guests are met by helicopters and armed guards. Should they accidentally stray into the exclusionary &quot;box&quot; surrounding Groom's airspace, even military pilots training in the NAFR are reportedly grilled extensively by military intelligence agents.

Perimeter security is provided by uniformed private security guards working for EG&amp;G, who patrol in desert camouflage [[Jeep Cherokee]] and [[High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle|Hum-Vee]] vehicles, and more recently champagne coloured Ford F-150 pickups and gray Chevy 2500 4X4 pickups.  Although the guards are armed with [[M16 (rifle)|M16s]], no violent encounters with Area 51 observers have been reported; instead the &quot;camo dudes&quot; generally follow visitors near the perimeter and radio for the  Lincoln County sheriff.  Modest fines (of around $600) seem to be the norm, although some visitors and journalists report receiving follow-up visits from [[FBI]] agents.  Some observers have been detained on public land for pointing camera equipment at the base.  Surveillance is also conducted using buried motion sensors and by [[HH-60 Pave Hawk]] helicopters.

The base does not appear on public U.S. government maps; the USGS topological map for the area only shows the long-disused Groom Mine, and the civil aviation chart for Nevada shows a large restricted area, but defines it as part of the Nellis restricted airspace.  Similarly the National Atlas page showing [http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/pdf/fedlands/nv.pdf federal lands in Nevada] does not distinguish between the Groom block and other parts of the Nellis range.  Although officially declassified, the original film taken by U.S. [[Corona (satellite)|Corona]] [[Reconnaissance satellite|spy satellite]] in the 1960s has been altered prior to declassification; in answer to freedom of information queries, the government responds that these exposures (which map to Groom and the entire NAFR) appear to have been destroyed ([http://www.fas.org/irp/overhead/groom_corona_200567.jpg Corona image]). [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] satellite images (which were publicly available) were removed from webservers (including [[Microsoft]]'s &quot;Terraserver&quot;) in 2004 ([http://terraserver.microsoft.com/GetImageArea.ashx?t=1&amp;s=17&amp;lon=-115.81666666666666&amp;lat=37.233333333333334&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;f=Tahoma,Verdana,Sans-serif&amp;fs=10&amp;fc=ffffffff&amp;logo=1 Terraserver image]), and from the monochrome 1 m resolution USGS datadump made publicly available.  NASA [[Landsat 7]] images are  still available (these are used in the [[NASA World Wind]]).  Non-U.S. images, including high-resolution photographs from Russian satellites and the commercial [[IKONOS]] system, are also easily available (and abound on the Internet).

Despite the official government ban on discussing the matter, the phrase &quot;groom lake&quot; does [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22groom+lake%22+site%3Aaf.mil&amp;btnG=Search appear] on several publicly-accessible U.S. Air Force websites most of which are unambiguously refering to the facility.

[[Image:Wfm x51 extraterrestrial highway.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Extraterrestrial Highway'' sign]]
Nevada's state government, recognizing the folklore surrounding the base might afford the otherwise neglected area some tourism potential, officially renamed the section of [[Nevada State Route 375]] near Rachel &quot;The Extraterrestrial Highway&quot;, and posted fancifully illustrated signs along its length.

Although federal property within the base is exempt from state and local taxes, facilities owned by private contractors are not.  One researcher has reported that the base only declares a taxable value of $2 million to the Lincoln County tax assessor, who is unable to enter the area to perform an assessment.  Some Lincoln County residents have complained that the base is an unfair burden on the county, providing few local jobs (as most employees appear to live in or near Las Vegas) and imposing an iniquitous burden of land sequestration and law enforcement costs.

===Environmental lawsuit===
In 1994 five unnamed civilian contractors and the widows of contractors Walter Kasza and Robert Frost sued the USAF and the [[Environmental Protection Agency]].  Their suit, in which they were represented by [[The George Washington University|George Washington University]] law professor Jonathan Turley, alleged they had been present when large quantities of unknown chemicals had been burned in open pits and trenches at Groom. [[biopsy|Biopsies]] taken from the complainants were analyzed by [[Rutgers University]] [[biochemistry|biochemists]], who found high levels of [[dioxin]], [[dibenzofuran]], and [[trichloroethylene]] in their body fat.  The complainants alleged they had sustained skin, liver, and respiratory injuries due to their work at Groom, and that this had contributed to the deaths of Frost and Kasza. The suit sought compensation for the injuries they had sustained, claiming the USAF had illegally handled toxic materials, and that the EPA had failed in its duty to enforce the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (which governs handling of dangerous materials).  They also sought detailed information about the chemicals to which they alleged they had been exposed, hoping this would help the medical treatment of those still living.

The government petitioned trial judge, U.S. District Judge Philip Pro (sitting in the U.S. District Court in Las Vegas), to disallow disclosure of classified documents or examination of witnesses on secret matters, alleging this would expose classified information and threaten national security.  When Judge Pro rejected the government's argument, [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] issued a Presidential Determination, exempting what it called &quot;the Air Force's Operating Location Near Groom Lake, Nevada&quot; from environmental disclosure laws.  Consequently Pro dismissed the suit due to lack of evidence.  Turley appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit court of appeal]] on the grounds that the government was abusing its power to classify material. [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Sheila E. Widnall]] filed a brief which said that disclosures of the materials present in the air and water near Groom &quot;can reveal military operational capabilities or the nature and scope of classified operations.&quot;  The Ninth Circuit rejected Turley's appeal, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear it, putting paid to the complainants' case.  

The [[President of the United States|President]] continues to annually issue a determination continuing the Groom exception ([http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_cfr_3v1&amp;docid=3CFRSep19 2000 determination], [http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/09/20020918-9.html 2002 determination], [http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/09/20030916-4.html 2003 determination]). This (albeit tacitly) constitutes the only formal recognition the U.S. Government has ever given that Groom Lake is more than simply another part of the Nellis complex.

===1974 Skylab photography===
In January 2006 aviation journalist Dwayne Day published an article in online aerospace magazine ''The Space Review'' titled &quot;Astronauts and Area 51: the Skylab Incident.&quot;  The article was based around a recently&lt;!--2004--&gt; declassified memo written in [[1974]] to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] director [[William Colby]] by an unknown CIA official. The memo reported that astronauts on board [[Skylab 4]] had, as part of larger program, inadvertently photographed a location of which the memo said ''&quot;There were specific instructions not to do this.  &lt;redacted&gt; was the only location which had such an instruction.&quot;''  Although the name of the location was obscured, the context led Day to believe that the subject was Groom Lake.

The memo details debate between federal agencies regarding whether the images should (or indeed could) be classified, with Department of Defense agencies arguing that it should and [[NASA]] and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] arguing against classification.  The memo itself questions whether it was legal for images obtained by an unclassified program to be retroactively classified.

Remarks on the memo, handwritten apparently by DCI ([[Director of Central Intelligence]]) Colby himself, read:

:''He did raise it - said State Dept. people felt strongly. But he inclined leave decision to me (DCI) - I confessed some question over need to protect since:''
:#''USSR has it from own sats''
:#''What really does it reveal?''
:#''If exposed, don't we just say classified USAF work is done there?''

The declassified documents do not disclose the outcome of the discussions regarding the Skylab imagery, but they were not placed in the National Archive at [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]] along with the rest of the Skylab 4 photographs.

== UFO and other conspiracy theories concerning Area 51 ==
Its secretive nature and undoubted connection to classified aircraft research, together with reports of unusual phenomena, have led Area 51 to become a centerpiece of modern [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] and [[conspiracy theory]] [[folklore]].  Some of the unconventional activities claimed to be underway at Area 51 include:

*the storage, examination, and [[reverse engineering]] of crashed [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] spacecraft (including material supposedly recovered at [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]]), the study of their occupants (living and dead), and the manufacture of aircraft based on alien technology. 
*meetings or joint undertakings with extraterrestrials.
*the development of exotic [[energy weapons]] (for [[Strategic Defense Initiative|SDI]] applications or otherwise) or means of [[weather control]].
*activities related to a supposed shadowy [[world government]].

Many of the theories concern underground facilities at Groom or at nearby Papoose Lake, and include claims of a transcontinental underground railroad system, a disappearing airstrip (nicknamed the &quot;Cheshire Airstrip&quot;, after [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Cheshire cat]]) which briefly appears when water is sprayed onto its [[camouflage]]d [[asphalt]] ([http://www.serve.com/mahood/nellis/area19/cheshire.htm]), and engineering based on alien technology. In 1989 [[Bob Lazar]] claimed that he had worked at a facility at Papoose Lake (which he called S-4) on such a U.S. Government [[flying saucer]].

One major theory is that Area 51 is a place which simulates the environment of the moon. In 2000-2001, [[Fox Television]] broadcasted a show about [[Apollo moon landing hoax accusations]], where it was discussed that the whole moon landing in [[1969]] was a hoax and was filmed in parts of Area 51. Soviet satellite photography indicates that parts of Area 51 resemble the moon surface as shown in the Moon landing video.

Others, however, claim that during the mid 1990s the most secret work previously done at Groom was quietly moved to other facilities, including [[Dugway Proving Ground]] in [[Utah]], and that the continued secrecy around Groom is largely a successful attempt at [[misdirection]].

== Area 51 in popular culture ==
[[Image:Area51.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 2005 ''Area 51'' [[First-person shooter|FPS]] video game]] &lt;!-- ''please'' don't add futher popular-culture images - on is sufficient, and more would weaken our fair-use assertion --&gt;
The base is featured in episodes of the television series ''[[The Simpsons]] (area 51A)'', ''[[Futurama (TV series)|Futurama]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[American Dad]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Taken]]'', ''[[Seven Days]]'' (Never Never Land), ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Kim Possible]]'', ''[[Megas XLR]]'' (as Area 50), and ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', the movies ''[[Groom Lake (film)|Groom Lake]],'' ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' (Area 52) and ''[[Independence Day (movie)|Independence Day]]'', and in the computer and video games ''[[Area 51 (video game)|Area 51]]'', ''[[Area 51 (first-person shooter)|Area 51]]'', ''[[Deus Ex]]'', ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', ''[[Tomb Raider|Tomb Raider III]]'', ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', ''[[The Pandora Directive]]'', ''[[Twisted Metal 3]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' (Area 69), ''[[Destroy All Humans!]]'' (Area 42), ''[[SimCity 4]]'' (Area 5.1). ''[[Half-Life (computer game)|Half-Life]]'', which is set mostly in and around the fictional [[Black Mesa Research Facility]], is generally considered to be modeled after Area 51. It is also featured in several [[novel]]s by [[Dale Brown]] and [[Robert Doherty]]'s ([[Bob Mayer]]) [[Area 51 novels|Area 51 series]], which take place after Area 51 scientists make contact with extraterrestrials.  The [[alternate history]] roleplaying game [[Deadlands]] also features an 1880s version of the location called &quot;Fort 51&quot;.

Area 51 has been used in several role-playing games as a plot element. In the game ''[[Conspiracy X]]'', it is a safe facility and base of operations for the players' counter-extraterrestrial operations. On the flip side, in the ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' modern day conspiracy supplement ''[[Delta Green]]'', the base is the site of a foolish conspiracy's laboratory facilities for studying and intercepting otherworldly beings for study.  

Area 51 is the name given to a variety of unrelated products and companies, including a range of computers built by [[Alienware]], the [http://area51.phpbb.com/ development area] for the [[phpBB]] forum software, one of the areas of the [[Geocities]] web hosting service, an [[Aprilia]] [[motor scooter]], and numerous science-fiction bookstores and bulletin boards.

In 1994, Version 2.0 of the [[Read-only memory|ROM]] for the [[Apple Newton]] [[personal digital assistant]] included the latitude and longitude co-ordinates of Area 51 in the Time Zones application as an &quot;[[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]]&quot;. This feature was removed (supposedly at the request of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]) by applying a software patch, but it remained possible to bypass the patch fairly easily. [http://www.cupertino.de/pages/archiv/EasterEggs/Newton.html]

The world's largest [[model railway]] in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] features a fictional Area 51 model in its [[United States|America]] section (with aliens playing [[basketball]] with base personnel).

The tiny town of [[Rachel, Nevada]] (the nearest settlement to the base) enjoys minor celebrity status as being &quot;the official home of Area 51&quot;.  Located three hours from Las Vegas by car, Rachel receives a modest number of visitors year-round, and several small businesses offer food and lodging to visitors, together with aerospace and &quot;alien&quot; themed merchandising.  The visitor numbers are swelled yearly with aviation enthusiasts hoping to catch a glimpse of the [[RED FLAG exercise]]s.  A small museum sells maps, photographs, badges, and other Area 51 material, and a local inn, aptly named &quot;The Little A'le'Inn&quot; proudly displays a [[time capsule]] received from the production crew of ''[[Independence Day (movie)|Independence Day]]''.

The [[minor league baseball]] team in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] is called the [[Las Vegas 51s]].  Their logo includes the image of a &quot;[[Greys|Grey]]&quot; [[extraterrestrial]].

Also, the popular classic Area 51 shooter is the leader in arcade game revenue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Audio signal processing''', sometimes referred to as '''audio processing''', is the processing of a [[representation]] of [[sound|auditory]] [[Signal (information theory)|signals]], or [[sound]]. The representation can be [[digital]] or [[analog signal|analog]]. An analog representation is usually electrical; a [[voltage]] level represents the [[air pressure]] [[waveform]] of the sound. Similarly, a digital representation expresses the pressure wave-form as a sequence of symbols, usually [[Binary numeral system|binary]] numbers.

The focus in audio signal processing is most typically a [[mathematical analysis]] of which parts of the signal are audible. For example, a signal can be modified for different purposes such that the modification is controlled in the auditory domain. Which parts of the signal are heard and which are not, is not decided merely by [[physiology]] of the [[human]] [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] system, but very much by [[psychological]] properties. These properties are analysed within the field of [[psychoacoustics]].

Processing methods and application areas include [[audio storage|storage]], [[audio level compression|level compression]], [[audio data compression|data compression]], [[transmission (telecom)|transmission]], enhancement (e.g., [[equalization]], [[audio filter|filtering]], [[noise cancellation]], [[echo]] or [[reverb]] removal or addition, etc.), [[source separation]], [[sound effect]]s and [[computer music]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amdahl's law''', named after [[computer]] architect [[Gene Amdahl]], is used to find the maximum expected improvement to
an overall system when only part of the system is improved. 

__TOC__

Amdahl's law can be interpreted more technically, but in simplest terms it means that it is the [[algorithm]] that decides the speedup not the number of processors. You eventually reach a place where you can not parallelise the algorithm any more.

Amdahl's law is a demonstration of the [[Diminishing returns|law of diminishing returns]]: while one could speed up part of a computer a hundred-fold or more, if the improvement only affects 12% of the overall task, the best the [[speedup]] could possibly be is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1 - 0.12} = 1.136&lt;/math&gt; times faster.

More technically, the law is concerned with the [[speedup]] achievable from an improvement to a computation that affects a proportion ''P'' of that computation where the improvement has a speedup of ''S''. (For example, if an improvement can speedup 30% of the computation, ''P'' will be 0.3; if the improvement makes the portion affected twice as fast, ''S'' will be 2.) Amdahl's law states that the overall speedup of applying the improvement will be

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1 - P) + \frac{P}{S}}&lt;/math&gt;.

To see how this formula was derived, assume that the running time of the old computation was 1, for some unit of time. The running time of the new computation will be the length of time the unimproved fraction takes (which is 1 &amp;minus; ''P'') plus the length of time the improved fraction takes. The length of time for the improved part of the computation is the length of the improved part's former running time divided by the speedup, making the length of time of the improved part ''P''/''S''. The final speedup is computed by dividing the old running time by the new running time, which is what the above formula does.

Here's another example. We are given a task which is split up into four parts: P1 = .11 or 11%, P2 = .18 or 18%, P3 = .23 or 23%, P4 = .48 or 48%, which add up to 100%. Then we say P1 is not sped up, so S1 = 1 or 100%, P2 is sped up 5x, so S2 = 5 or 500%, P3 is sped up 20x, so S3 = 20 or 2000%, and P4 is sped up 1.6x, so S4 = 1.6 or 160%. By using the formula &lt;math&gt;\frac{P1}{S1} + \frac{P2}{S2} + \frac{P3}{S3} + \frac{P4}{S4}&lt;/math&gt;, we find the running time is &lt;math&gt;{\frac{.11}{1} + \frac{.18}{5} + \frac{.23}{20} + \frac{.48}{1.6}} = .4575&lt;/math&gt; or a little less than 1/2 the original running time which we know is 1. Therefore the overall speed boost is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{.4575} = 2.186&lt;/math&gt; or a little more than double the original speed using the formula &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\frac{P1}{S1} + \frac{P2}{S2} + \frac{P3}{S3} + \frac{P4}{S4}}&lt;/math&gt;. Notice how the 20x and 5x speedup don't have much effect on the overall speed boost and running time when over half of the task is only sped up 1x (i.e. not sped up) or 1.6x.



== Parallelization ==

In the special case of parallelization, Amdahl's law states that if ''F'' is the fraction of a calculation that is sequential (i.e. cannot benefit from parallelisation), and (1 &amp;minus; ''F'') is the fraction that can be parallelised, then the maximum speedup that can be achieved by using ''N'' processors is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{F + (1-F)/N}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the limit, as ''N'' tends to [[infinity]], the maximum speedup tends to 1/''F''. In practice, price/performance ratio falls rapidly as ''N'' is increased once (1 &amp;minus; ''F'')/''N'' is small compared to ''F''.

As an example, if ''F'' is only 10%, the problem can be sped up by only a maximum of a factor of 10, no matter how large the value of ''N'' used. For this reason, [[parallel computing]] is only useful for either small numbers of [[central processing unit|processor]]s, or problems with very low values of ''F'': so-called [[embarrassingly parallel]] problems. A great part of the craft of [[parallel programming]] consists of attempting to reduce ''F'' to the smallest possible value.

==Amdahl's Rule Of Thumb==

'''Amdahl's Rule Of Thumb''' is that 1 byte of [[memory]] and 1 byte per second of [[Input/output|I/O]] are required for each [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]] per second supported by a [[computer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This entry focuses on the Ayahuasca brew; for information on the vine of the same name, see [[Banisteriopsis caapi]].''

The widely used [[Quechua language|Quechua]] name '''''ayahuasca''''' has two highly interrelated yet distinct meanings and referents: 1) an [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] giant vine native to the [[rainforest]] containing various [[harmala]] [[alkaloid]]s, generally ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'', and, by extension, 2) [[pharmacology|pharmacologically]] complex infusions prepared from it for [[shamanism|shaman]]ic, [[folk medicine|folk-medicinal]], and [[religion|religious]] purposes. Sections of vine are boiled alone or with leaves from any of a large number of other plants, including ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'' (''chakruna'' in Quechua) or ''[[Diplopterys cabrerana]]'', yielding a brew containing the powerful [[entheogen|entheogenic]] alkaloid [[N,N-dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT), a [[psychedelic drug|hallucinogen]] which is active orally only when combined with an [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOI]].  Western brews often substitute plant sources such as [[harmal|Syrian Rue]] or other harmala containing plants in lieu of the ''Banisteriopsis caapi'' vine. [[Image:aya-preparation.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ayahuasca being prepared in the [[Napo Province|Napo]] region of [[Ecuador]].]]

Often brews are made with no DMT-containing plants; sometimes they are made with plants such as ''Justicia pectoralis'', [[Brugmansia]], or various cacti; and often they are made with no plants other than the ayahuasca vine itself. The potency of this brew varies radically from one batch to the next, both in strength and psychoactive effect, based mainly on the skill of the [[shaman]] producing it, as well as other admixtures sometimes added. 

==Names==
* &quot;caapi&quot;, &quot;daime&quot;, &quot;hoasca&quot; in [[Brazil]]
* &quot;yagé&quot; or &quot;yajé&quot; in [[Colombia]]; popularized in English by the [[beatnik]] writers [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]]
* &quot;ayahuasca&quot; or &quot;ayawaska&quot; in [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], also to a lesser extent in Brazil (&quot;vine of the dead&quot; or &quot;vine of souls&quot;: in Quechua, ''aya'' means &quot;spirit,&quot; &quot;ancestor,&quot; or &quot;dead person,&quot; while ''waska'' means &quot;vine&quot; or &quot;rope&quot;). The name is properly that of the plant ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'', one of the primary sources of beta-carbolines for the brew.

It should be noted that the spelling ''ayahuasca'' is the hispanicized version of the name; many Quechua or [[Aymara]] speakers would prefer the spelling ''ayawaska''.

==Usage==
Ayahuasca is used in large part as a religious sacrament, no matter the culture it is tied with. This means that those who use ayahuasca in non-traditional areas often align themselves with the traditions of the visionary shamans. This includes citizens of modern Western countries, who put their faith above the restricting laws of their governments. 

However, while this is the main use of ayawaska known by non-native users, it is far from the only use of these brews. Traditional usage revolves around the medicinal properties of ayahuasca, and its purgative properties are highly important (many people refer to it as ''la Purga'', &quot;the purge&quot;) as the intense vomiting it produces can clear the body of dangerous worms and other [[parasite]]s common in the rainforest.

[[Image:aya-cooking.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Ayahuasca cooking in the [[Napo Province|Napo]] region of [[Ecuador]].]]

Dietary taboos are almost always associated with the use of Ayahuasca; in the rainforest, these tend towards the purification of one's self- abstaining from spicy and heavily spiced foods, fat, salt, and sex before, after, or both before and after a ceremony.  In western usage, a diet is usually followed that avoids [[list of foods containing tyramine|foods containing tyramine]], as the interaction of [[tyramine]] and an maoi can lead to a [[hypertensive crisis]]; most tyramine comes from the aging of food, and is therefore not usually a problem in South American traditional culture.  While the Western diet is designed to avoid physical complications from the ingestion of maois, the traditional diet is largely spiritual in nature; many Western users opt to follow the traditional diet as well around ceremonies.  

===Traditional and Western===
Nowadays, the term ayahuasca is also used outside of its native region to mean analogous concoctions made with other plants that contain the two main components, an [[MAOI]] and [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], one of its analogues, or [[pharmahuasca]], made from pure chemical extracts. In this usage, the [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] is generally considered the main &quot;active ingredient&quot;, causing the desired effects. The MAOI is necessary for DMT to be active orally. However, most ayahuasqueros and many who work with the tea regularly object to this and state that the ''Banisteriopsis'' vine is the only defining ingredient, everything else being of secondary importance. In some areas, it is even said that the chacruna or chaliponga admixtures are added only to make the tea taste sweeter.  This is a strong indicator of the often wildly divergent intentions and cultural differences between the native ayahuasca-using cultures and psychedelics enthusiasts in other countries. While the DMT can be thought of as creating the desired state, the vine itself is considered by many to be the &quot;spirit&quot; of the tea; it is the gatekeeper to the other realms and the guide through the experience, controlling access to the altered states and helping one navigate them.  Traditionally, ''B. caapi'' is and has been the defining ingredient of the tea.

In modern [[Europe]] and [[North America]], ayawaska analogues are often prepared using non-traditional plants which contain the same alkaloids. For example, seeds of the Syrian rue plant [[harmal]] are often used as a substitute for the ayawaska vine, and the DMT-rich ''[[Mimosa hostilis]]'' is used in place of ''chakruna''. [[Australia]] has several indigenous plants which are popular among modern ayahuasqueros there, such as various DMT-rich species of ''[[Acacia]]''.

In modern Western culture, [[entheogen]] users sometimes base concoctions off of Ayahuasca.  When doing so, most often Rue or ''B. caapi'' are used with a non-traditional, non-DMT admixture, such as [[psilocybin]] or [[mescaline]].  Nicknames such as Psilohuasca or shroomahuasca for mushroom based mixtures, or Pedrohuasca (from the San Pedro Cactus, which contains mescaline) are often given to such brews.  This is usually only done by experienced entheogen users who are more familiar with the chemicals and plants being used, as the uninformed combination of various neuro-chemicals can be dangerous and most are unaware that such combinations can be made.

It seems unlikely that Ayahuasca could ever emerge as a &quot;street-drug&quot;, given the difficulty of making the tea and the intense experience it provides.  Most Western users employ it almost exclusively for spiritual purposes, in line with both traditional, animist usage and organized churches such as the UDV.  A diet is almost always followed before use, including a day of fasting, to rid the body of tyramines and other contraindicated chemicals; a &quot;''dieta''&quot; is often followed as well, to spiritually cleanse the body before and after the experience.  Most recreational drug users have never even heard of Ayahuasca, DMT or MAOIs, or the possibility of alterations to the shamanic brew.

===Introduction to the West===
Ayahuasca is mentioned in the writings of some of the earliest [[missionary|missionaries]] to [[South America]], but it wasn't for some time that it became commonly known in the West.  The early missionary reports generally claim it as [[demon]]ic, and great efforts were made by the [[Roman Catholic]] Church to stamp it out.  

When originally researched in the [[20th century]], the active chemical constituent of Caapi was called ''[[telepathine]]'', but it was found to be identical to a chemical already isolated from ''Peganum harmala'' and given the name harmaline.

William Burroughs sought yagé (still considered to be &quot;telepathine&quot;) in the [[1950s]] while traveling through South America, in the hopes that it could relieve or cure [[opiate]] [[addiction]]. ''[[The Yage Letters]]'', written between Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg were probably the first major introduction of Ayahuasca to the West.

Ayahuasca was made more widely known by [[Terence McKenna|Terence]] and [[Dennis McKenna]]'s experiences with Amazonian tribes as detailed in the book ''[[Invisible Landscape]]'', which they co-authored. Their journey to the rainforest to search for Ayahuasca was spurred by their reading of Burroughs and Ginsberg.  Dennis later extensively studied the [[pharmacology]], [[botany]], and [[chemistry]] of ayahuasca and [[oo-koo-he]], which were the subjects of his master's thesis.

In Brazil, a number of modern religious movements based on the use of ayahuasca have emerged, the most famous of them being ''[[Santo Daime]]'' and the ''[[Uniao do Vegetal]]'' (or UDV), usually in a [[Spiritism|animistic]] context that may be shamanistic or, more often, (as with Santo Daime and the UDV,) mixed with [[Christianity|Christian]] imagery.  Both Santo Daime and Uniao do Vegetal now have members and churches throughout the world.

Similarly, the US and Europe has started to see new religious groups born of experiences with ayahuasca.  In the US a [[Wiccan|Wicca]] group, PaDeva, has become the first incorporated legal church with which ayahuasca is central to their beliefs.
 
Several notable celebrities have publicly discussed their use of ayahuasca, including [[Sting]], [[Tori Amos]], and [[Paul Simon]] (who wrote the song ''Spirit Voices'' about his experience with the brew in the Amazon).

==Plant constituents==
===Traditional===
Traditional Ayahuasca brews are always made with ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'' as an MAOI, although DMT sources and other admixtures vary from region to region.  There are several [[Banisteriopsis caapi#Types of vine|varieties of caapi]], often known as different &quot;colors&quot;, with varying effects, potencies, and uses.

DMT admixtures:
* ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'' (Chakruna) - leaves
* ''[[Diplopterys cabrerana]]'' (Chaliponga, ''Banisteriopsis rusbyana'') - leaves
* ''[[Psychotria carthagensis]]'' (Amyruca) - leaves

Other common admixtures:
* ''[[Justicia pectoralis]]''
* [[Brugmansia]] (Toé)
* ''[[Nicotiana rustica]]'' (Mapacho)
* ''[[Ilex guayusa]]'', a relative of [[yerba mate]]

===Western===
Although traditional plant materials are often used, sources with similar chemical constituents are often substituted for the traditional ingredients.

MAOI:
* [[Harmal]] (''Peganum harmala'', Syrian Rue) - seeds
* [[Passion flower]]

DMT admixture sources:
* ''[[Acacia maidenii]]'' (Maiden's Wattle), ''[[Acacia phlebophylla]]'', and other [[Acacia]]s, most commonly employed in [[Australia]] - bark
* ''[[Anadenanthera peregrina]]'', ''A. colubrina, A. excelsa, A. macrocarpa''
* ''[[Mimosa hostilis]]'' (Jurema) - root bark - not traditionally employed with ayawaska by any existing cultures, though likely it was in the past. Popular in Europe and North America. 
* ''[[Reed canary grass|Phalaris arundinacea]]'', (Reed Canary Grass)
* ''[[Phalaris aquatica]]'' (''Phalaris tuberosa'', Harding Grass) 
* ''[[Phragmites australis]]'' (common reed)

==Legal Status==
Internationally, DMT is a Schedule I drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. The Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances notes, however, that the plant itself is excluded from international control[http://www.maps.org/pipermail/maps_forum/2001-March/003376.html]:
:''The cultivation of plants from which psychotropic substances are obtained is not controlled by the Vienna Convention. . . . Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the Peyote cactus nor the roots of the plant Mimosa hostilis nor Psilocybe mushrooms themselves are included in Schedule 1, but only their respective principles, mescaline, DMT and psilocin.'' 

A [[fax]] from the Secretary of the International Narcotics Control Board to the [[Netherlands]] Ministry of Public Health sent in [[2001]] goes on to state that ''&quot;Consequently, preparations (e.g.decoctions) made of these plants, including ayahuasca are not under international control and, therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the 1971 Convention.&quot;'' [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_law10.shtml]

The legal status of these plants in the United States is somewhat questionable.  Ayahuasca plants and preparations are legal as they contain no scheduled chemicals. However, brews made using DMT containing plants are illegal since DMT is a Schedule I drug.  That said, some people are challenging this, using arguments similar to those used by peyotist religious sects, such as the [[Native American Church]]. A court case allowing ''Uniao do Vegetal'' to use the tea for religious purposes in the United States, ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal]]'', was heard by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] on November 1, 2005; the decision, released February 21st, 2006, allows the UDV to use the tea in its ceremonies persuant to the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]].

Religious use in Brazil was legalized after two official inquiries into the tea in the mid-1980s, which concluded that ayahuasca is not a recreational drug and has valid spiritual uses.  (more on the legal status of ayahuasca can be found in the [[Erowid]] vault on the [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_law.shtml legality of ayahuasca]).

In [[France]], Santo Daime won a court case allowing them to use the tea in early 2005; however, they were not allowed an exception for religious purposes, but rather for the simple reason that they did not perform chemical extractions to end up with pure DMT and harmala and the plants used were not scheduled.  Four months after the court victory, the common ingredients of Ayahuasca as well as harmala were declared ''stupéfiants'', or narcotic schedule I substances, making the tea and its ingredients illegal to use or possess. See [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=SANP0521544A%20#] and [http://afssaps.sante.fr/htm/10/filcoprs/indco.htm] (both in French) for more information.

In the United States, on February 21, 2006, the Brazilian-based religious group O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal (UDV) was awarded by the Supreme Court the legal right to use ayahausca as their sacrament.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Abbe-diagram.png|right|thumb|380px|An Abbe diagram plots the Abbe number against refractive index for a range of different glasses (red dots). Glasses are classified using the Schott Glass letter-number code to reflect their composition and position on the diagram.]]

In [[physics]] and [[optics]], the '''Abbe number''', also known as the '''V-number''' or '''constringence''' of a transparent material, is a measure of the material's [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (variation of [[refractive index]] with wavelength). It is named for [[Ernst Abbe]] ([[1840]]-[[1905]]), the German physicist who defined it.

The Abbe number ''V'' of a material is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{ n_D - 1 }{ n_F - n_C }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[refractive index|refractive indices]] of the material at the wavelengths of the [[Fraunhofer lines|Fraunhofer]] D-, F- and C- [[spectral line]]s (589.2 [[Nanometre|nm]], 486.1 nm and 656.3 nm respectively). Low dispersion materials have high values of ''V''.

Abbe numbers are used to classify [[glass]]es. For example, [[flint glass]]es have ''V''&lt;50 and [[Crown glass (optics)|crown glass]]es have ''V'' &gt;50. Typical values of ''V'' range from around 20 for very dense flint glasses, up to 65 for very light crown glass, and up to 85 for [[fluorite|fluor]]-crown glass. Abbe numbers are only a useful measure of dispersion for visible light, and for other wavelengths, or for higher precision work, the [[dispersion (optics)|group velocity dispersion]] is used.

Alternate definitions of the Abbe number are used in some contexts. The value ''V''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt; V_d = \frac{n_d-1}{ n_F - n_C }&lt;/math&gt;
which defines the Abbe number with respect to the yellow Fraunhofer d (or D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) [[helium]] line at 587.6 nm wavelength. It can also be defined at the blue [[iron]] e-line at 438.4 nm:
:&lt;math&gt; V_e = \frac{n_e-1}{ n_{F'} - n_{C'}}&lt;/math&gt;
where F' and C' are the blue and red [[cadmium]] lines at 480.0 nm and 643.8 nm, respectively.

An '''Abbe diagram''' is produced by plotting the Abbe number ''V''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; of a material versus its refractive index ''n''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. Glasses can then be categorised by their composition and position on the diagram. This can be a letter-number code, as used in the [[Schott Glass]] catalogue, or a 6-digit [[glass code]].

Abbe numbers are used to calculate the necessary [[focal length]]s of achromatic doublet [[lens (optics)|lenses]] to minimize [[chromatic aberration]].

''For the physical process, see [[ablation]]. For the science fiction concept, see [[ablative armor]].''

In [[linguistics]], the '''ablative case''' is a [[declension|noun case]] found in several languages, including [[Latin]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]],  [[Sanskrit]] and the [[Finno-Ugric languages]]. 

The Latin ablative combines the functions of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ablative (indicating &quot;from&quot;), [[instrumental case|instrumental]] (indicating &quot;with&quot; or &quot;by&quot;), and [[locative case|locative]] (indicating &quot;in&quot;) cases, which merged together in the development of Latin. From these original meanings several others developed, including the ablative of cause (indicating &quot;caused by&quot;), the ablative of time and means (indicating &quot;at the time of&quot;, deriving from the locative), and the [[ablative absolute]].

In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the ablative case is the sixth of the locative cases with the meaning &quot;from off of&quot;, e.g. ''pöytä &amp;mdash; pöydältä'' &quot;table &amp;mdash; off from the table&quot;. It is an outer locative case, used just as the [[adessive]] and [[allative]] cases to denote both being on top of something and &quot;being around the place&quot; (as opposed to the inner locative case, the [[elative]], which means &quot;from out of&quot; or &quot;from the inside of&quot;).

The other locative cases in Finnish are:
*[[Inessive case]] (&quot;in&quot;)
*[[Elative case]] (&quot;out of&quot;)
*[[Illative case]] (&quot;into&quot;)
*[[Adessive case]] (&quot;on&quot;)
*[[Allative case]] (&quot;onto&quot;)

== Latin usage ==
The case also exists in three kinds besides its direct purpose and [[Ablative absolute|''Ablativus absolutus'']]:
* ''Ablativus separationis'' with meaning of separation, e.g. ''movere loco'' - &quot;to put aside&quot;, ''educere castris'' - &quot;to bring out from camp&quot; or ''domo'' - &quot;from home&quot;, ''Roma'' - &quot;from Rome&quot;;
* ''Ablativus causae'' means the reason, e.g. ''ira clamare'' - &quot;to shout because of anger&quot;, ''morbo abesse'' - &quot;to absent because of disease&quot;;
* ''Ablativus comparativus'' which is used in comparisons, e.g. ''vilius argentum'' '''auro''' - &quot;the silver is cheaper than gold&quot;;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Adamic language''' is a term for the hypothetical [[proto-language]] believed spoken by [[Adam and Eve]] in [[paradise]], either identical with the language used by [[God]] to address Adam, or invented by Adam as '''nomothete''' (name-giver, [[Genesis]] 2:19). It is unclear whether the Bible assumes that this language was preserved by Adam's descendents until the [[confusion of tongues]] (Genesis 11:1-9), or that it began to evolve naturally as a consequence of [[Original sin]] (Genesis 10:5).

In previous centuries, many scholars believed that the Adamic language was [[Biblical Hebrew]], and that all languages are descended from it. The Bible does not make a direct claim to that extent, however, and some [[Early Modern]] scholars based on Genesis 10:5 have assumed that the [[Japhetite]] languages are rather the direct descendents of the Adamic language, having separated before the confusion of tongues, by which also Hebrew was affected.

The modern concept corresponding to that of the Adamic language is that of the [[Proto-World language]], but rather than positing divine inspiration,  linguists assume that it arose from [[proto-linguistic]] forms of communication.

==The Adamic language in Mormonism==
In [[Mormonism]], the Adamic language has been thought by some [[Latter Day Saints]] to be the language of [[God]]. Though different from Hebrew, the Hebrew language was thought to contain remnants of this ancient language, including the words [[Elohim]] and [[Jehovah]]. According to [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]]'s translation of the ''Bible'', this language was &quot;pure and undefiled&quot; ([[Book of Moses]] 6:6).

Some early leaders of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], including founder Joseph Smith, Jr. ([[Journal of Discourses|JD]] 2:342), and [[Latter-day Saint]] leaders [[Brigham Young]] ([[History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (book)|HC]] 1:297) and [[Elizabeth Ann Whitney]] (7 Woman's Exponent 83 (Nov. 1, 1878)) claimed to have received several words in the Adamic language in revelations.  Some Latter Day Saints believe that the Adamic language will be restored as the universal language of humankind at the end of the world.

The name of the [[Mormon]] settlement &quot;[[Adam-ondi-Ahman]]&quot; in Daviess County, [[Missouri]], US, is said to be in the Adamic language. Also, some allegedly Adamic words were used in the [[Endowment (Mormonism)|Temple Endowment]] prior to [[1990]]. While no written copy of them is available, they were pronounced the same as the English words &quot;Pay Lay El&quot;. The given English translation was &quot;Oh God, hear the words of my mouth.&quot; The English translation is used in the rite today.

Other words thought by some Mormons to derive from the Adamic language include ''[[deseret]]'' (&quot;honey bee&quot;, see [[Book of Ether|Ether]] 2:3), ''Ahman'' (&quot;God&quot;), ''son Ahman'' (&quot;Son of God&quot;, see LDS [[Doctrine and Covenants|D&amp;C]] 78:20, 95:17), ''sons Ahman'' (&quot;sons of God&quot;), and ''shelem'' (&quot;height&quot;, see [[Book of Ether|Ether]] 3:1).  ''[[Nauvoo]]'' (&quot;beautiful&quot;) is also often popularly attributed to Adamic, but it is actually a [[Sephardi Hebrew]] word ([[Standard Hebrew]] &amp;#1504;&amp;#1488;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1493; ''navu'').

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny''''' (''Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny'') is a political-satirical [[opera]] composed by [[Kurt Weill]] to a [[German language|German]] [[libretto]] by [[Bertolt Brecht]].  It was first performed in [[Leipzig]] on [[March 9]] [[1930]].

== Plot ==
The story is that three criminals (Leokadja Begbick, Trinity Moses and Fatty) create the city of Mahagonny. Drinking, gambling, prize-fights and similar activities are the sole occupation of the inhabitants, and money rules. There are only two main characters, Jenny, a prostitute, and Jim Mahoney, a lumberjack. Mahagonny is threatened by a [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] at the end of Act 1, which despite much anticipation &amp; causing much distress simply bypasses the city. In Act 2 following the hurricane nothing is forbidden and various scenes of debauchery occur. Jenny and Jim try to leave but Jim cannot pay his debts and is arrested. Another character [[arraignment|arraigned]] for [[murder]], [[bribery|bribe]]s his way out of it, but Jim has no money and is condemned to death for not paying for his whisky. The opera ends with discontent destroying the city, which burns as the inhabitants march away.

The music uses a number of styles, including [[ragtime|rag-time]], [[jazz]] and formal [[counterpoint]], notably in the ''[[Alabama Song]]'' (covered by [[The Doors]]). The lyrics for the ''Alabama Song'' and another song, the ''Benares Song'' are in English (albeit specifically idiosyncratic English) and are performed in that language even when the opera is performed in its original ([[German language|German]]) language.

== History ==
It had its premiere in [[Leipzig]] in March [[1930]] and played in [[Berlin]] in December of the following year. The opera was banned by the [[Nazis]] in [[1933]] and did not have a significant production until the 1960s. It has played in opera houses around the world. Never achieving the popularity of Weill and Brecht's ''[[Threepenny Opera]],'' ''Mahagonny'' is still considered a work of stature with a haunting score. Herbert Lindenberger in his book ''Opera in History'', for example, views ''Mahagonny'' alongside Schoenberg's ''[[Moses und Aron]]'' as indicative of the two poles of modernist opera.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Felix II''' is generally considered an  [[antipope]] rather than a [[pope]]. In [[356]] he was raised from the [[archdeacon]]ate of [[Rome]] to the Papal chair, when [[Pope Liberius|Liberius]] was banished by the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Constantius II|Constantius]] for refusing to subscribe the sentence of condemnation against [[Athanasius]]. Felix's election was contrary to the wishes both of the [[clergy]] and of the people, and the [[consecration]] ceremony was performed by certain [[prelates]] belonging to the court. In [[357]], at the urgent request of an influential deputation of Roman ladies, Constantius agreed to the release of Liberius on the condition that he signed the semi-[[Arianism|Arian]] [[creed]]. Constantius also issued an edict to the effect that the two bishops should rule conjointly, but Liberius, on his entrance into Rome in the following year, was received by all classes with so much enthusiasm that Felix found it necessary to retire at once from Rome.

Regarding the remainder of his life, little is known, and the accounts handed down are contradictory, but he appears to have spent the most of it in retirement at his estate near [[Porto]]. He died in [[365]], and (on what grounds it is impossible to determine) was enrolled amongst the number of [[martyr]]s, his day being [[July 22]]. In the reign of [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]], the claim of Felix to rank among the popes was discussed, and in order to discover whether any miraculous help was to be found to aid in the decision of the question, his [[sarcophagus]] was opened. It was said the words &quot;Pope and Martyr&quot; were found inscribed on his body, but this [[supernatural]] testimony is in contradiction to that of the earlier authorities of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''alkaloid''' is a [[nitrogen|nitrogenous]] organic [[molecule]] that has a [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] effect on [[human]]s and [[animal]]s. The name derives from the word [[alkaline]]; originally, the term was used to describe any nitrogen-containing [[base (chemistry)|base]] (an [[amine]] in modern terms). Alkaloids are found as [[Secondary metabolite|secondary metabolites]] in [[plant]]s (e.g., in [[potato]]es and [[tomato]]es), animals (e.g., in [[shellfish]]) and [[fungus|fungi]], and can be extracted from their sources by treatment with [[acid]]s (usually [[hydrochloric acid]] or [[sulfuric acid]], though organic acids such as [[maleic acid]] and [[citric acid]] are sometimes used).

Usually alkaloids are derivatives of amino acids.

Even though many alkaloids are [[poison]]ous (such as [[strychnine]] or [[coniine]]), some are used in medicine as [[analgesic]]s (pain relievers) or [[anaesthetic]]s, particularly [[morphine]] and [[codeine]]. Most alkaloids have a very bitter taste.

Although formally an alkaloid, the class of [[:Category:pyrazoles|pyrazoles]] contain two [[nitrogen]] atoms in the [[aromatic]] [[ring structure]] and are not found in nature. They must be produced synthetically.

== Alkaloid classifications ==

Alkaloids are usually classified by their common molecular precursors, based on the [[metabolic pathway]] used to construct the molecule. When not much was known about the [[biosynthesis]] of alkaloids, they were grouped under the names of known compounds, even some non-nitrogenous ones (since those molecules' structures appear in the finished product; the opium alkaloids are sometimes called &quot;phenanthrenes&quot;, for example), or by the plants or animals they were isolated from. When more is learned about a certain alkaloid, the grouping is changed to reflect the new knowledge, usually taking the name of a biologically-important amine that stands out in the synthesis process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Archbishcantarms.PNG|thumb|right|Arms of the [[episcopal see|see]] of Canterbury]]
The '''[[Archbishop]] of [[Canterbury]]''' is the senior clergyman of the established [[Church of England]] and symbolic head of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]]. The present incumbent is [[Rowan Williams]].

Today the archbishop fills four main roles:
*he is the diocesan [[bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]], which covers the east of the County of [[Kent]] and extreme north-east [[Surrey]]. Founded in [[597]], it is the oldest [[episcopal see|bishopric]] in the English church.
*he is the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of the [[Province of Canterbury]], which covers the southern two-thirds of [[England]].
*as '''[[Primate (religion)|Primate]] of All England''', he is the chief ''religious'' figure in the Church of England (the [[British monarchy | British sovereign]] is the &quot;[[Supreme governor]]&quot; of the church). Power in the church is not highly centralised, so the archbishop (along with his &quot;junior&quot; colleague the [[Archbishop of York]]) must usually lead through persuasion. He plays an important part in national ceremonies such as [[coronation of the British monarch | coronations]]; thanks to his high public profile his opinions are often in demand by the [[news media]].
*as symbolic head of the Anglican Communion, the archbishop is recognized as ''primus inter pares'' (&quot;first among equals&quot;) of all [[Anglican]] [[primate (religion)|primates]]. Since [[1867]] he has convened more or less decennial meetings of worldwide Anglican bishops, the [[Lambeth Conferences]].

The Archbishop's main residence is [[Lambeth Palace]] in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]]. He also has lodgings in the Old Palace, [[Canterbury]], located beside [[Canterbury Cathedral]], where his [[cathedra]] sits.

As holder of one of the &quot;five great sees&quot; (along with those of [[Archbishop of York|York]], [[Bishop of London|London]], [[Bishop of Durham|Durham]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]]), the Archbishop of Canterbury is ''ex officio'' one of the [[Lords Spiritual]] of the [[House of Lords]]. He is one of the highest-ranking men in England, ranking directly below the Royal Family.

Since [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke with [[Rome]] the Archbishops of Canterbury have been selected by the English (latterly British) monarch.  Today the choice is made in the name of the Sovereign by the prime minister, from a shortlist of two selected by an ad-hoc committee called the [[Crown Nominations Commission]].

As the current archbishop, the Right Honourable and Most Reverend '''[[Rowan Williams|Dr Rowan Douglas Williams]]''', the 104th '''Lord Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of All England''' was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on [[27 February]] [[2003]]; he signs himself ''Rowan Cantuar''. He was previously [[Archbishop of Wales]] and [[Bishop of Monmouth]].

==Origins==

Records suggest that the Roman Britons had three Archbishops, seated in [[London]], [[York]], and [[Caerleon]], an ancient city of South Wales. However, in the fifth and sixth centuries the country was overrun by the pagan [[Anglo-Saxon]]s. Of the kingdoms they set up there, [[Kingdom of Kent | Kent]] had the closest ties to European trade and culture.

The first Archbishop of Canterbury was Saint [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] who arrived in [[Kent]] in [[597]], sent by [[Pope]] [[Gregory the Great]] to mission to the English. He was accepted by King [[Ethelbert of Kent|Ethelbert]], on his conversion to Christianity, about the year [[598]].  Since then the Archbishops of Canterbury have been referred to as occupying the Chair of St [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]]. 

Before the break with Papal authority in the [[16th Century]], the Church of England was an integral part of the worldwide [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The present Church of England, an established national church, still considers itself part of the broader Western Catholic tradition as well as being the &quot;mother church&quot;  of the worldwide Anglican Communion.

== Province and Diocese==
{{Anglicanism}}
The Archbishop of Canterbury exercises metropolitical (or supervisory) jurisdiction over the [[Province of Canterbury]], which encompasses thirty of the forty-four dioceses of the Church of England.  (The remaining fourteen dioceses, in northern England, fall within the Province of York.)  Formerly, the four dioceses of Wales were also under the Province of Canterbury; in [[1920]], however, the Welsh dioceses transferred from the established Church of England to the disestablished [[Church in Wales]].

The Archbishop of Canterbury has a ceremonial provincial ''curia'', or court, consisting of some of the senior bishops of his province.  The Bishop of London&amp;mdash;the most senior cleric of the Church with the exception of the two Archbishops&amp;mdash;serves as Canterbury's Provincial Dean, the Bishop of Winchester as Chancellor, the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] as Vice-Chancellor, the [[Bishop of Salisbury]] as Precentor, the [[Bishop of Worcestor]] as Chaplain and the [[Bishop of Rochester]] as Cross-Bearer.

The question of whether the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Archbishop of York should take precedence was once a cause of a long struggle.  The dispute was temporarily resolved in [[1071]] after [[Lanfranc]], Archbishop of Canterbury, and [[Thomas I of York|Thomas of Bayeux]], Archbishop of York, submitted the matter to the [[Pope]].  [[Pope Alexander II]] decided that Canterbury was to have precedence, and that future Archbishops of York would have to be consecrated by, and swear allegiance to, the Archbishop of Canterbury. 

In [[1119]], however, the Archbishop-Elect of York, [[Thurstan]], refused to acknowledge the pre-eminence of Canterbury.  As a consequence, the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Ralph d'Escures]], refused to consecrate him.  When Thurstan appealed to Rome, [[Pope Callixtus II]] not only personally consecrated him, but also issued a [[papal bull]] repudiating the supremacy of Canterbury.  The matter was finally settled by [[Pope Innocent VI]] during the fourteenth century.  Under Pope Innocent's arrangement, which lasts to this day, the Archbishop of Canterbury would be recognised as superior to the Archbishop of York.  The former would be acknowledged as &quot;Primate of All England&quot;, and the latter as &quot;Primate of England&quot;.  The pre-eminence of the Archbishop of Canterbury is acknowledged by an Act of Parliament passed during the reign of Henry VIII.

The Archbishop of Canterbury also has a precedence of honour over the other archbishops of the Anglican Communion.  He is recognised as ''primus inter pares'', or first amongst equals.  The Archbishop of Canterbury, however, does not exercise any direct authority in the provinces outside England.

The Archbishop at the present time has four suffragan bishops. One of these, the [[Suffragan Bishop of Dover]], is given the additional title of &quot;Bishop in Canterbury&quot; and empowered to act almost as if he were the diocesan bishop of the  [[Diocese of Canterbury]], since the Archbishop is so frequently away fulfillfilling national and international duties. The Suffragan Bishop of Maidstone is a second assistant working in the diocese. The suffragan bishops of Ebbsfleet and Richborough, on the other hand, are [[provincial episcopal visitor]]s for the whole Province of Canterbury, licensed by the Archbishop as &quot;flying bishops&quot; to visit parishes throughout the province who are uncomfortable with the ministrations of their local bishop who has participated in the ordination of women.

== Style and privileges ==
Both the Archbishops of Canterbury and York are styled &quot;The Most Reverend&quot;; retired Archbishops as &quot;The Right Reverend&quot;. Archbishops are, by convention, appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], and may therefore also use &quot;[[The Right Honourable]]&quot; for life (unless they are later removed from the Council). In formal documents, the Archbishop of Canterbury is referred to as &quot;The Most Reverend Father in God, [[Forenames]], by Divine Providence Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England and Metropolitan&quot;. In debates in the House of Lords, the Archbishop is referred to as &quot;The Most Reverend Primate, the Archbishop of Canterbury&quot;. &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; is not used in either instance. He may also be formally  addressed as &quot;Your Grace&quot; - or, more often these days, simply as &quot;Archbishop&quot;, &quot;Father&quot; or (in the current instance) &quot;Dr Williams&quot;.

The surname of the Archbishop of Canterbury is not used in formal documents; only the forenames and see are mentioned.  The Archbishop is legally permitted to sign his name as &quot;Cantuar&quot; (from the [[Latin]] for Canterbury).  He shares the right to use only a title in the signature with the Archbishop of York, other bishops, and Peers of the Realm.

In the [[United Kingdom order of precedence|order of precedence]], the Archbishop of Canterbury is ranked above all individuals in the realm, with the exception of the Sovereign and members of the Royal Family. Immediately below him is the [[Lord Chancellor]], and then the Archbishop of York.

The Archbishop of Canterbury's official residence in London is [[Lambeth Palace]]. Until the [[19th century]], the Archbishops also had major residences at [[Croydon Palace]] and [[Addington Palace]]. There are also the ruins of a Palace at [[Otford]].

The following Archbishops have died at Lambeth: Wittlesey, in 1375; Kemp, 1453; Dean, 1504; all buried in Canterbury Cathedral: Cardinal Pole, the last Catholic archbishop, 1558, after lying in state here 40 days was buried at Canterbury; Parker, 1575, buried in Lambeth Chapel; Whitgift, 1604, buried at Croydon; Bancroft, 1610, buried at Lambeth; Juxon, 1663, buried in the chapel of St. John's College, Oxford; Sheldon, 1667, buried at Croydon; Tillotson, 1694, buried in the church of St. Laurence Jewry, London; Tennison, 1715; and Potter, 1747, both buried at Croydon; Seeker, 1768; Cornwallis, 1783, and Moore, 1805, all buried at Lambeth. Of the medi&amp;aelig;val archbishops, in 1381 Simon of Sudbury fell a victim to [[Wat Tyler]] and his followers when they attacked Lambeth Palace.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Albion''' is a city located in [[Calhoun County, Michigan|Calhoun County]] in the south central region of [[Michigan]]. From the time that the earliest [[English language|English]]-speaking settlers arrived, the area has also been known as '''The Forks''', because it is situated at the confluence of the north and south branches of the [[Kalamazoo River]]. The ''Festival of the Forks'' has been celebrated annually since [[1967]], celebrating Albion's ethnic heritage.

The presence of several major manufacturers through its history has given Albion the reputation of a factory town, though the presence of several major educational institutions has given small town Albion an intellectual character. [[Albion College]] is a nationally renowned private liberal arts college with a student population of about 1,950. Albion is [[Sister city]] to [[Noisy-le-Roi]], France.

==History==

The first white settler, [[Tenney Peabody]], arrived in [[1833]]. 
As local legend goes, Peabody's wife decided to name the city after [[Albion, Oswego County, New York]] where another prominent pioneer, [[Jesse Crowell]], came from. The city was almost named ''Peabodyville'', but Albion was the preferred choice.

Crowell arrived in [[1835]] and established the Albion Company to lay out the plan for the village and to sell property to other pioneers as they arrived. He became the first postmaster in [[1838]]. Albion incorporated as a village in [[1855]] and as a city in [[1885]]. 

In 1835, [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist Episcopal]] settlers established Albion College, which was known by a few other names before 1861 when the college was fully authorized to confer four-year degrees on both men and women. The first classes were held in Albion in [[1843]].

The forks of the Kalamazoo River provided power for [[Watermill|mills]] and Albion quickly became a mill town as well as an agricultural market. A railroad line arrived in [[1852]], fostering the development of other industries. 

Albion was named an [[All-America City Award|All-America City]] in [[1973]] by the [[National Civic League]]. It celebrated winning the award on [[May 15]], [[1974]] when the Governor of Michigan, [[William Milliken]], and many dignitaries came to town. However, in [[1975]] the closure of a major factory cut the celebration short and new challenges were created overnight. 

Since that time citizens have mobilized, with support from the Albion Community Foundation founded in [[1968]], and the Albion Volunteer Service Organization founded in the 1980s with support from Albion College to address the challenge of diminishing economic opportunity.

== Law and government ==

Albion has a [[Council-manager government|Council-Manager]] form of government. City residents elect a Mayor and City Council members from six districts. The council in turn selects a City Manager to handle day-to-day affairs of the city.  The mayor presides over and is a voting member of the council. Council members are elected to four-year terms, staggered every two years. A mayor is elected every two years.

== Geography ==

    <title>Anointing of the Sick</title>
    <id>2348</id>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anointing of the Sick''' is one of the [[sacrament]]s of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], and is also administered in some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Churches. [[Anglicans]] are divided on the issue, as many consider it a sacrament, but the rest agree that it is at least a [[sacramentals|sacramental]].

Apart from the use of one or other of the synonyms &quot;anointing&quot; and &quot;unction&quot;, the sacrament, in which a priest anoints a seriously sick person with oil blessed specifically for that purpose, has also been known as the holy oil of the sick, the unction or blessing of consecrated oil, the unction of God, the office of the unction, and so on. The ([[Greek language|Greek]] name is {{polytonic|Εὐχέλαιον}} (Euchelaion), derived from {{polytonic|εὐχή}} (prayer) and {{polytonic|ἔλαιον}} (oil).

In past centuries, when the sacrament was in fact conferred only on those in ''immediate'' danger of [[death]], it came to be known in the West as &quot;Extreme Unction&quot;, i.e. &quot;Final Anointing&quot;. It was then conferred only as one of the &quot;Last Rites&quot;. The other &quot;Last Rites&quot; are Confession (if the dying person is physically unable to confess, at least absolution, conditional on the existence of contrition, is given), and the [[Eucharist]], which when administered to the dying is known as &quot;[[Viaticum]]&quot;, a word whose original meaning in [[Latin language|Latin]] was &quot;provision for a journey&quot;. The normal order of administration, unless there is imminent danger of death, is first Confession, then Anointing, then Viaticum.

The chief [[Bible|Biblical]] text for anointing of the sick is the [[Epistle of James]]:
:''Are any among you sick? They should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.  And their prayer offered in faith will heal the sick, and the Lord will make them well. And anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven.''
:::::James 5:14-15

The Catholic Church sees the effects of the sacrament as follows. As the sacrament of Marriage gives grace for the married state, the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick gives grace for the state into which people enter through sickness. Through the sacrament is given a gift of the Holy Spirit that renews confidence and faith in God and strengthens against temptations to discouragement and anguish at the thought of death. It thus leads to spiritual healing and, sometimes, bodily healing as well.

The 2004 dictionary of the Greek language by George D. Babiniotis ({{polytonic|Γεώργιος Δ. Μπαμπινιώτης}}) states that this sacrament of the Greek Orthodox Church &quot;is customary in cases of sickness or when someone thinks he is having ill luck.&quot;

==Form==
In the Catholic Church, the special olive oil used (Oil of the Sick) is blessed by the bishop of the diocese at the Chrism Mass he celebrates on [[Holy Thursday]] or on a day close to it.  However, in case of necessity, the priest administering the sacrament may bless the oil within the framework of the celebration. The Eastern Orthodox Church follows a similar discipline.

In Protestant Churches and in the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], any [[elder (religious)|elder]] or minister may consecrate the oil they use for anointing the sick.

Anointing of the Sick can be administered on an individual basis according to the individual person's needs, at home or in a hospital, usually (in the case of Catholics) in connection with Confession and administration of Holy Communion. It can also be given to a group: Catholic [[parish]]es often offer a communal Anointing of the Sick once or twice a year, usually within celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].

In the Latin Catholic Church, the priest anoints the sick person's forehead with oil (usually in the form of a cross), saying: &quot;Through this holy anointing may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit.&quot; He then anoints the hands, while saying, &quot;May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up.&quot; He may also, in accordance with local culture and traditions and the needs of the sick person, anoint other parts of the body, but without repeating the sacramental formula. Anointing other parts of the body was obligatory in the Western Church before the [[Second Vatican Council]] (when the sacramental form was &quot;Through this holy anointing, may the Lord pardon you whatever sins you have committed&quot;), and still is in the Eastern Churches. The full form of the Eastern Christian anointing requires the presence of seven priests, though this is rarely the case today.

Some Protestant churches, especially [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]], [[Charismatic]]s, and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] perform Anointing of the Sick in a form usually very different from Catholic and Orthodox practice, drawing inspiration directly from the James passage quoted above. Generally (but not necessarily) a [[Clergy|minister]] performs the rite, with no set formula, and the sick person is prayed for. The ritual is not associated with nearness to death, and there is not necessarily any reference to forgiveness of sins. Catholic theology requires that administration of the sacrament be by a validly ordained priest, and thus holds that the rite in question, though helpful, like any prayer, for the sick person, is not a valid sacrament or channel of grace.

In [[computer science]], an '''abstract data type (ADT)''' is a mathematical specification of a set of data and the set of operations that can be performed on the data.  Such a data type is abstract in the sense that the focus is on the definitions of the constructor that returns an abstract handle that represents the data, and the various operations with their arguments.  The actual implementation is not defined, and does not affect the use of the abstract data type.

==Examples==
ADTs typically seen in textbooks and implemented in programming languages (or their libraries) include:
*[[String (computer science)|String]]
*[[List]]
*[[Stack (computing)|Stack]]
*[[Queue]]
*[[Binary search tree]]
*[[Priority queue]]
*[[Complex number]]

==Separation of interface and implementation==
When realized in a computer program, the ADT is represented by an interface, which shields a corresponding implementation.  Users of an ADT are concerned with the interface, but not the implementation, as the implementation can change in the future.  (This supports the principle of [[information hiding]], or protecting the program from design decisions that are subject to change.)

The strength of an ADT is that the implementation is hidden from the user.  Only the interface is published.  This means that the ADT can be implemented in various ways, but as long as it adheres to the interface, user programs are unaffected.

There is a distinction, although sometimes subtle, between the abstract data type and the data structure used in its implementation.  For example, a List ADT can be represented using an array-based implementation or a linked-list implementation.  A List is an abstract data type with well-defined operations (add element, remove element, etc.) while a linked-list is a pointer-based data structure that can be used to create a representation of a List.  The linked-list implementation is so commonly used to represent a List ADT that the terms are interchanged and understood in common use.

Similarly, a Binary Search Tree ADT can be represented in several ways: binary tree, AVL tree, red-black tree, array, etc.  Regardless of the implementation, the Binary Search Tree always has the same operations (insert, remove, find, etc.)

==Built-in abstract data types==
Because some ADTs are so common and useful in computer programs, some programming languages are building implementations of ADTs into the language as native types or adding them into their standard libraries.  For instance, Perl arrays can be thought of as an implementation of the List or Deque ADTs and Perl hashes can be thought of in terms of Map or Table ADTs.  The C++ Standard Library and Java libraries provides classes that implement the List, Stack, Queue, Map, Priority Queue, and String ADTs.
 
==Concrete examples==
===Rational numbers as an abstract data type===
For example, [[rational number]]s (numbers that can be written in the form a/b where a and b are integers) cannot be represented natively in a computer.  A Rational ADT could be defined as shown below.

Construction: Create an instance of a rational number ADT using two integers, a and b, where a represents the numerator and b represents the denominator.

Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, comparison, simplify, conversion to a real (floating point) number.

To be a complete specification, each operation should be defined in terms of the data.  For example, when multiplying two rational numbers a/b and c/d, the result is defined as ac/bd.  Typically, inputs, outputs, preconditions, postconditions, and assumptions to the ADT are specified as well.

===Stack===
====Interface====
In a more concrete example, written in C-style notation, the interface for a [[Stack (computing) | Stack]] ADT might be:

 long stack_create(); /* create new instance of a stack */
 void stack_push(long stack, void *item); /* push an item on the stack */
 void *stack_pop(long stack); /* get item from top of stack */
 void stack_delete(long stack); /* delete the stack */

====Usage====
This ADT could be used in the following manner:

 long stack;
 struct foo *f;
 
 stack = stack_create(); /* create a stack */
 
 stack_push(stack, f); /* add foo structure to stack */
 
 f = stack_pop(stack); /* get top structure from stack */

====Implementation variants====
The above stack ADT could be initially implemented using an array, and then later changed to a linked list, without affecting any user code.

The number of ways a given ADT can be implemented depends on the programming language.  For example, the above example could be written in C using a struct and an accompanying set of data structures using arrays or linked lists to store the entries; however, since the constructor function returns an abstract handle, the actual implementation is hidden from the user.  In object-oriented languages such as C++ and Java, ADTs are typically represented using the class construct where the data is represented by data members (attributes) and the operations are represented by member functions (methods).  In addition, some languages such as C++ and Java provide a mechanism of enforcement (the private or protected keywords) to only allow the defined functions to operate on the data.  When using object-oriented ADTs, the user can often expand the ADT by creating a subclass of the ADT.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AmericanFootballLeague.jpg|thumb|right|150px|AFL logo]]

The '''American Football League (AFL)''' was a professional league of [[American football]] that operated from 1960 to 1969.  In 1970 the AFL [[AFL-NFL merger|merged]] operations with the [[National Football League]].  All ten AFL franchises became part of the merged league, which retained the NFL name.

''Note: There were three earlier and unrelated American football leagues of the same name:  One in 1926, one in 1936-1937 and one in 1940-1941.  They are listed at the end of this article.''

==League history==
===&quot;The Foolish Club&quot;===
In 1958 [[Lamar Hunt]] (son and heir of [[Texas]] oilman [[H. L. Hunt]]) attempted to bring an NFL franchise to his hometown of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] but was rejected by the league.  A second attempt in 1959 was also unsuccessful.  Hunt was advised by league officials to contact the owners of the [[Chicago Cardinals]], who offered to sell Hunt a 20 percent stake in the team.  Hunt rejected the offer, and it was then that he began to envision not just a new team in the NFL, but an entirely new league.

Hunt began his quest for a new league by contacting others who had shown interest in the Cardinals, and assessing their interest in starting a new league.  These included [[Bud Adams|K.S. (Bud) Adams]] of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Bob Howsam]] of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and [[Max Winter]] and [[Bill Boyer]] of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]].  This brought to four the number of potential teams in the new league.  

Next, Hunt sought franchises in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]].  But at the same time he sought the blessings of the NFL for his nascent league, as he did not seek a rivalry with the older and more established league.  &quot;I told myself I didn’t want to go into this if it meant some kind of battle,&quot; Hunt would later recall. &quot;Of course, this was one of the more naive thoughts in the history of pro sports.&quot; [http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/]

Soon after, Hunt received commitments from [[Barron Hilton]] (Los Angeles) and [[Harry Wismer]] (New York).  On [[August 14]], [[1959]] the first league meeting was held in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and charter teams were given to Dallas, New York, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles and Minneapolis.  On [[August 22]] the league was officially named the American Football League.

Two more cities were awarded franchises later in the year - [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] ([[Ralph C. Wilson Jr.|Ralph Wilson]]) on [[October 28]] and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] ([[William H. Sullivan|William H. (Billy) Sullivan]]) on [[November 22]].  The AFL's first draft took place the same day Boston was awarded their franchise.  The draft lasted for 33 rounds.

===The first crisis===
In November 1959, Minneapolis owner Max Winter announced his intent to leave the AFL in order to accept a franchise offer from the NFL.  In 1961, his team began play in the NFL, where it took the name [[Minnesota Vikings]].   

The NFL now offered Hunt what he had originally wanted - an expansion franchise in Dallas.  Hunt turned the NFL down, as he felt it would not be right to abandon his fellow AFL owners.  Had Hunt left the AFL, it would likely have never played its first game.

===The AFL begins (1959-61)===
With the first major crisis passed, the AFL got back to the business of preparing for its first season.  On [[November 30]], [[1959]] [[Joe Foss]], a [[World War II]] [[United_States_Marine_Corps|Marine]] hero and former governor of [[South Dakota]], was named the AFL's first Commissioner.   Foss commissioned a friend of Harry Wismer's to develop the AFL's eagle-on-football logo.  The league held a second draft on [[December 2]], which lasted for 20 rounds.  Hunt was elected President of the AFL on [[January 26th]], 1960.  On [[January 28]], the NFL awarded an expansion franchise to Dallas, which would offer direct competition to Hunt's team.  The Minneapolis franchise formally withdrew from the AFL on [[January 27]] and was replaced on [[January 30]] by one in [[Oakland, California]], owned by a group of local investors headed by [[Chet Soda]].

===The first coup===
[[Billy Cannon]], the All-American and 1959 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner from [[Louisiana State University]], had an uncommon combination of brute strength with the speed of a sprinter. In 1960, his signing by the [[Houston Oilers]] followed a fierce bidding war that began when Oilers owner Bud Adams met Cannon in the end zone following LSU's Sugar Bowl victory, and ended in court, with the AFL winning against the NFL. That put the fledgling league on the football map. Cannon was one of the American Football League's most celebrated combatants. At halfback, he scored an 88-yard touchdown on a pass from [[George Blanda]] in the first AFL Championship game.  Cannon became the only player ever selected to an All-star team as a halfback in one year (1961) and as a tight end in another (1969).

On [[June 9]], the league signed a five-year [[television]] contract with [[American_Broadcasting_Company|ABC]], which brought in revenues of roughly $2,125,000 per year for the entire league.  On [[June 17]], the AFL filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL.  The suit was dismissed in 1962 after a two-month trial.

The AFL began regular-season play (a night game on Friday, [[September 9]], [[1960]]) with eight teams in the league - the [[Boston Patriots]], [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]], [[Denver Broncos]], [[Houston Oilers]], [[Los Angeles Chargers]], [[New York Titans]] and [[Oakland Raiders]].  The Oilers became the first-ever league champions, defeating the Chargers 24-16 in the AFL Championship Game on [[January 1]], [[1961]].

Attendance for the 1960 season was respectable for a new league, but not nearly that of the NFL.  Whereas the more popular NFL teams in 1960 regularly saw attendance figures of 50,000+, AFL attendance generally hovered between 10-20,000 [http://nflhistory.net/linescores/pdf/1960a.pdf].  With the low attendance came financial losses.  The Raiders, for instance, lost $500,000 in their first year.  In an early sign of stability, however, the AFL did not lose any teams after its first year of operation.  In fact, the only major change was the relocation of the Chargers from Los Angeles to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]].

===Movement and instability (1962-63)===
While some teams (such as the Oilers) found instant success in the AFL, others were not as fortunate.  The Oakland Raiders and New York Titans struggled on and off the field during their first few seasons in the league.  Oakland's eight-man ownership group was reduced to just three in 1961, after heavy financial losses their first season.  Attendance for home games was poor, partly due to the fact that the team was playing in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], which already had an established NFL team (the [[San Francisco 49ers]]).  The product on the field was also to blame.  After winning six games their debut season, the Raiders won just three times combined in the 1962 and 1963 seasons.  Oakland took part in a 1962 supplemental draft meant to boost the weaker teams in the league, but it did little good.  They participated in another such draft in 1963.

The Titans fared a little better on the field but had their own financial troubles.  Attendance was so low for home games that fans were moved to seats closer to the field to give the illusion of a fuller stadium on television.  Things got so bad that owner Harry Wisner was unable to meet his payroll, and on [[November 8]], [[1962]] the AFL took over operations of the team.  The Titans were sold to a five-person ownership ground headed by [[Sonny Werblin]] on [[March 28]], [[1963]].  Werblin changed the team's name to the '''New York Jets'''.

In the December 23, 1962 [[Professional American football championship games|AFL Championship game]], the Dallas Texans dethroned the two-time defending champion Oilers 20-17 in what at that time was professional football's longest game, a double-overtime thriller.  

In 1963 the Texans became the second AFL team to relocate.  Lamar Hunt felt that despite winning the league championship in 1962, the Texans could not succeed financially in the same market as the [[Dallas Cowboys]].  After meetings with [[Atlanta]] and [[Miami]], Hunt decided on [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] as the new home for his team.  On [[May 22]] Hunt announced the move, and the team was christened the '''Kansas City Chiefs''' on [[May 26]].

===Watershed years (1964-65)===
1964 started off very well for the AFL.  On [[January 29]] the league signed a lucrative $36 million television contract with [[NBC]], to start in the 1965 season.  This gave the league money it desperately needed to compete with the NFL for talent.

A new single-game attendance record was set on [[November 8]], [[1964]] when 61,929 fans packed [[Shea Stadium]] to watch the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills [http://nflhistory.net/linescores/pdf/1964a.pdf].

The bidding war between the AFL and NFL for players escalated in 1965.  The Chiefs drafted [[Gale Sayers]] in the first round of the AFL's 1965 draft, while the [[Chicago Bears]] did the same in the NFL draft.  Sayers signed with the Bears in a victory for the older league.  

A similar situation occurred when the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) and New York Jets (AFL) both drafted [[University of Alabama]] [[quarterback]] [[Joe Namath]].  But this time the AFL emerged the victor.  On [[January 2]], Namath signed a $427,000 contract with the Jets [http://www.newyorkjets.com/history/index.php?section=highlights&amp;years=1969-1959&amp;highlight_id=35#34].  It was the highest amount of money ever paid to a collegiate football player.  The signing was important not just for the Jets (one of the worst teams in the league) but for the AFL as well. 

The AFL expanded to nine teams in 1965 when Minneapolis attorney [[Joseph Robbie]] and television star [[Danny Thomas]] were awarded a franchise on [[August 16]] for a fee of $7.5 million.  Their team, the [[Miami Dolphins]], started play in the AFL's East division in 1966.

On the playing field, the quality of play continued to improve and bona fide stars began to emerge, such as [[Lance Alworth]], [[George Blanda]], [[Willie Brown (football player)|Willie Brown]], [[Nick Buoniconti]], [[Ron Mix]], and [[Jim Otto]].  AFL teams such as the [[San Diego Chargers]], the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and the [[Buffalo Bills]] offered fans exciting games as alternatives to the conservative NFL variety.

===Escalation and merger (1966-67)===
{{Details|AFL-NFL Merger}}
1966 saw the rivalry between the AFL and NFL reach an all-time peak.  On [[April 7]] Joe Foss, the only commissioner the AFL had ever known, resigned.  His chosen successor was Oakland Raiders general manager [[Al Davis]], who had been instrumental in turning around the fortunes of the franchise.  No longer content with trying to outbid the NFL for talent, the AFL under Davis actively started to recruit players already on NFL squads.  NFL players such as [[Mike Ditka]], [[Roman Gabriel]] and [[John Brodie]] were offered and/or signed to lucrative AFL contracts.

The same month Davis was named commissioner, Lamar Hunt and Dallas Cowboys owner [[Tex Schramm]] held a series of secret meetings in Dallas to discuss their concerns over rapidly increasing player salaries, as well as the practice of player poaching.  Hunt and Schramm completed the basic groundwork for a merger by the end of May.  On [[June 8]], [[1966]] the merger was officially announced.  Under the terms of the agreement, the two leagues would hold a common player draft.  The agreement also called for a title game to be played between the champions of the respective leagues.  The two leagues would be fully merged by 1970, and NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] would remain as commissioner of the merged league.  The AFL also agreed to pay indemnities of $18 million to the NFL over 20 years.  In protest, Davis resigned as AFL commissioner on [[July 25]] rather than remain until the completion of the merger.  

On [[January 15]], [[1967]], the first-ever World Championship Game between the champions of the two separate professional football leagues, the AFL-NFL Championship Game (retroactively referred to as [[Super Bowl I]]), was played in Los Angeles.  The NFL champion [[Green Bay Packers]] overwhelmed the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs, 35-10.

The [[Cincinnati Bengals]] became the second AFL expansion franchise on [[May 24]], [[1967]].  The Bengals were the tenth and final team to begin play as an AFL franchise.  In a clear indication of the success of the AFL, Paul Brown paid $10,000,000 for the Bengals franchise–''four hundred times more'' than the original AFL franchise value of $25,000 only eight years earlier.

===Legitimacy and the end of an era (1968-70)===
During the first two Super Bowl matchups, the Green Bay Packers won games against the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders by comfortable margins, leading some NFL executives to doubt the wisdom in merging with the upstart league.  That perception changed forever on [[January 12]], [[1969]], when the AFL Champion New York Jets shocked the heavily favored NFL Champion [[Baltimore Colts]] in [[Super Bowl III]].

The Colts, who entered the contest as an 18-point favorite, had completed the [[1968 NFL season]] with a 13-1 record, then won two playoff games, the latter a 34-0 dismantling of the [[Cleveland Browns]].  Baltimore's defense was considered one of the finest of its era, having allowed just 144 points in 1968.  In contrast, the Jets had allowed 280 points, the highest total for any division winner in the two leagues.   

But Jets quarterback Joe Namath seemed unimpressed.  Three days before the game, Namath spoke to a group at the Touchdown Club in [[Miami]] and declared, &quot;We're going to win Sunday, I'll guarantee you.&quot; [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/]

Namath and the Jets made good on his guarantee as they held the Colts scoreless until late in the fourth quarter.  The Jets won, 16-7, in what is considered by many to be one of the greatest upsets in American sports history. [http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/topupsets/010525.html] [http://football.about.com/cs/superbowl/a/bl_superbowl3.htm] [http://www.courierpostonline.com/columnists/cxww020105a.htm]

While no doubt shocked by the result, NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle nonetheless saw the Jets' victory as a watershed moment that would give a legitimacy to the merger.  That feeling was reinforced one year later in [[Super Bowl IV]], when the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs defeated the NFL champion [[Minnesota Vikings]], 23-7 in the last championship game to be played between the two leagues.  

The last contest in AFL history was the [[AFL All-Star Game]] on [[January 17]], [[1970]].  The Western All-Stars, led by Chargers quarterback [[John Hadl]], defeated the Eastern All-Stars, 26-3.

Prior to the start of the [[1970 NFL season]], the merged league was split into two conferences of three divisions each.  All ten AFL teams made up the bulk of the new [[American Football Conference]].  The old NFL's [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Cleveland Browns]] were also placed in the AFC.  All the other existing NFL squads moved to the [[National Football Conference]].

Some AFL fans had wanted the AFL and the NFL to set up a joint organizational structure like [[Major League Baseball]] where one entity operates two different sports leagues. Instead, the AFL gave up its name and logo to join the older league. The AFC logo used today has some elements of the old AFL logo. However the &quot;A&quot; in the AFL logo was blue; for unknown reasons, the &quot;A&quot; in the AFC logo is red.

===Legacy===
Of all the leagues that have attempted to challenge the dominance of the [[National Football League]], the AFL was the only one to have all its teams integrated into the fabric of the NFL.  This was in sharp contrast to such entities as the [[All-America Football Conference]], baseball's [[Federal League]], the [[American Basketball Association]] and the [[World Hockey Association]], all of which either folded, or only had a handful of teams join the respective post-merger entities. 

The NFL went on to adopt many of the innovative elements introduced by the AFL, including names on player jerseys, official scoreboard clocks and gate and revenue sharing. The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the [[Super Bowl]], which has become the standard for championship contests.

Hunt's vision brought a new professional football league not only to [[California]] and [[New York State|New York]], but to [[Colorado]] and later fast-growing [[Florida]], which hosted professional sports for the first time in their histories. The AFL also returned the sport to [[New England]] for the first time in 23 years. The AFL also adopted the first-ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the league office negotiated an ABC-TV contract, the proceeds of which were divided equally among member clubs. 

Four ''NFL'' franchises were awarded as a direct result of the interest of the AFL: The [[Dallas Cowboys]] began operations months after the AFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]] were created; the [[Minnesota Vikings]] were awarded to Max Winter in exchange for dropping his bid to join the AFL; the [[Atlanta Falcons]] franchise went to Rankin Smith to dissuade him from purchasing the AFL's [[Miami Dolphins]]; and the [[New Orleans Saints]] based on successful anti-trust legislation, championed by several [[Louisiana]] politicians, that helped the two leagues merge. 

Given the furious battle for playing talent, the AFL's arrival helped many [[Black players in American professional football|black players]] from small colleges helped broaden the talent base for players who subsequently contributed to the sport.{{ref|acho}}{{ref|ross}}

The AFL's free agents came from several sources.  Some were players who could not find success playing in the NFL, while another source was the [[Canadian Football League]]. In the late 1950s, many players released by the NFL, or un-drafted and unsigned out of college by the NFL, went North to try their luck with the CFL, and later returned to the states to play in the AFL.  

In the league's first years, men like the Oilers' [[George Blanda]], the Chargers/Bills' [[Jack Kemp]], the Texans' [[Len Dawson]], the Titans' [[Don Maynard]], the Raiders/Patriots/Jets'  [[Babe Parilli]], the Pats' [[Bob Dee]] proved to be AFL standouts.  Other players such as the Broncos' [[Frank Tripucka]], the Pats' [[Gino Cappelletti]], the Bills' [[Cookie Gilchrist]] and the Chargers' [[Tobin Rote]], [[Sam Deluca]] and [[Dave Kocourek]] also made their mark to give the fledgling league badly-needed credibility.  Rounding out this mix of potential talent were the true &quot;free agents&quot;, the walk-ons and the &quot;wanna-be's&quot;, who tried out in droves for the chance to play professional football.
  
The American Football League took advantage of the burgeoning popularity of football by locating teams in major cities that lacked NFL franchises, and by using the growing power of televised football games (bolstered with the help of major network contracts, first with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and later with [[NBC]]).  It featured many outstanding games, such as the classic 1962 double-overtime American Football League championship game between the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]] and the defending champion [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]].  At the time it was the longest [[Professional American football championship games|professional football championship game]] ever played.    

The AFL appealed to fans by offering a flashier alternative to the more conservative NFL.  Team uniforms were bright and colorful.  Long passes (&quot;bombs&quot;) were commonplace in AFL offenses, led by such talented quarterbacks as [[John Hadl]], [[Daryle Lamonica]] and [[Len Dawson]].

Another attractive feature of the American Football League was its competitive balance.  In the original eight-team league, in a fourteen game schedule, each team played every other team twice. Every team had the same &quot;strength of schedule&quot;, so the division champions were clearly the best teams in each division.  Further, the league championships were evenly divided: five were won by Western Division teams, five by the Eastern Division; and of the original eight teams, all but two (Denver and Boston/New England) won at least one AFL title, and only one did not make the playoffs at some time during the league's ten-year existence.

Players who chose the AFL to develop their talent included [[Lance Alworth]] and [[Ron Mix]] of the [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]], who had also been drafted by the NFL's [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[Baltimore Colts]] respectively.  Both eventually were elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] after earning recognition during their careers as being among the best at their positions.  Among specific teams, the [[1964]] [[Buffalo Bills]] stood out by holding their opponents to a pro football record 913 yards rushing on 300 attempts, while also recording fifty quarterback sacks in a fourteen-game schedule.

Despite having a national television contract, the AFL often found itself trying to gain a foothold, only to come up against roadblocks.  For example, CBS-TV, which broadcast NFL games, ignored results from the other league. 

The bidding war, which was financially draining both leagues, and the rapidly rising popularity of the AFL were factors that eventually led to the merger, leaving a merged league named the NFL.

==AFL teams==
The original eight AFL teams were as follows:

Eastern Division
*[[New England Patriots|Boston Patriots]] (now New England Patriots)
*[[Buffalo Bills]]
*[[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] (now Tennessee Titans)
*[[New York Jets|New York Titans]] (now New York Jets)

Western Division
*[[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]] (now Kansas City Chiefs)
*[[Denver Broncos]]
*[[San Diego Chargers|Los Angeles Chargers]] (now San Diego Chargers)
*[[Oakland Raiders]]

The eight-team roster enabled the league to set a schedule where every team played every other team twice during the fourteen-game season, as the AAFC did.

The league added a ninth team, the [[Miami Dolphins]], in 1966, and a tenth team, the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in 1968.

==AFL playoffs==
{{Details|AFL playoffs}}
From 1960 to 1968, the AFL determined its champion via a single playoff game between the winners of its two divisions. In 1969, a four team tournament was instituted, with the second place teams in each division also participating.

===AFL Championship Games===
* 1960 - [[Houston Oilers]] 24, [[Los Angeles Chargers]] 16
* 1961 - [[Houston Oilers]] 10, [[San Diego Chargers]] 3
* 1962 - [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]] 20, [[Houston Oilers]] 17 (double [[overtime (sport)|OT]])
* 1963 - [[San Diego Chargers]] 51, [[Boston Patriots]] 10
* 1964 - [[Buffalo Bills]] 20, [[San Diego Chargers]] 7
* 1965 - [[Buffalo Bills]] 23, [[San Diego Chargers]] 0
* 1966 - [[Kansas City Chiefs]] 31, [[Buffalo Bills]] 7
* 1967 - [[Oakland Raiders]] 40, [[Houston Oilers]] 7
* 1968 - [[New York Jets]] 27, [[Oakland Raiders]] 23
* 1969 - [[Kansas City Chiefs]] 17, [[Oakland Raiders]] 7

==AFL All Star games==
{{Details|American Football League All-Star games}}

The AFL did not play an All-Star game after its first season in 1960 but did stage All-Star games for the 1961 through 1969 seasons. All-Star teams from the Eastern and Western divisions played each other after every season except 1965. That season, the league champion [[Buffalo Bills]] played all-stars from the other teams.

After the 1964 season, the AFL All-Star Game had been scheduled for early 1965 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]' Tulane Stadium. After numerous black players were refused service by a number of New Orleans hotels and businesses, black and white players alike lobbied for a [[boycott]].  Under the leadership of [[Buffalo Bills]] players including [[Cookie Gilchrist|Carlton Chester &quot;Cookie&quot; Gilchrist]], the players put up a unified front, and the game was successfully moved to Houston's [[Jeppesen Stadium]].

==AFL All-Time Team==
In 1970, selectors for the Hall of Fame chose a first and second-team at each position, for an [[American Football League All-Time Team]].

==AFL records==
The following is a sample of some records set during the existence of the league.  The NFL considers AFL statistics and records equivalent to its own.
*Yards passing, game  - 464, [[George Blanda]] (Oilers, [[October 29]], [[1961]])
*Yards passing, season - 4,007, [[Joe Namath]] (Jets, 1967)

'''Associazione Sportiva Roma''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Rome]]. Nicknamed the ''giallorossi'', it plays in [[Serie A]]. Roma's home uniforms are dark red shirts with dark yellow borders, white shorts and black socks.

The emblem is the [[Founding of Rome|Capitoline she-wolf lactating twins]], symbol of Rome, superimposed a bipartite golden-yellow over red shield; official colors are the same as those of Rome, red for [[Roman Empire|imperial]] dignity, gold for the [[Christianity|Christian God]].

A.S. Roma was founded in [[July]] [[1927]]. The city of Rome already had three teams in the [[Italian Football League Teams|Italian football league]] (Alba, Fortitudo and Lazio), however the Fascist regime wanted to merge the latter into one which the working classes could identify with, the biggest club Lazio considered very much a patrician club of the Roman social elite, and strong enough to challenge the traditional northern teams to reinforce Rome's image as regime capital for propaganda purposes. Lazio  management refused to even discuss the matter, but Alba, Pro Roma, Fortitudo and Roman agreed to merge and thus Roma was founded. Roma was named after the city and with the red and yellow strip of the Roman club. The initial stadium was Motovelodromo Appio. 

They took part in their first league in the 1929-30 season and won their first scudetto in the 1941-42 season. The second was won in the 1982-83 season and the third in 2000-01. They were runners-up in 1930-31, 1935-36, 1980-81, 1983-84, 1985-86, 2001-02 and 2003-04. They were relegated only once, at the end of the 1950-51 season, returning to Serie A the next season.

The club has won the Coppa Italia seven times: 1963-64, 1968-69, 1979-80, 1980-81, 1983-84, 1985-86, and 1990-91, the Supercoppa Italia in 2001, and the UEFA Cup (Fairs Cup) once in 1960-61, defeating Birmingham City.

In 1984, Roma lost the final match of the European Cup, played in Rome, against Liverpool F.C., after a penalty shootout.

The current stadium is the 82,307 seater [[Stadio Olimpico]], which is shared with [[S.S. Lazio]].  The two teams compete against one another twice each year in the [[Rome derby]], a major and emotional event in Italian football.

==History==
===1950s to 1970s===
After returning to Serie A in 1952, Roma spent the remainder 1950s and early 1960s in the top half of Serie A. From 1963 to 1979, Roma endured a period of frustrating mediocrity with 3rd place in 1974-75 being the best they could manage, punctured by either mid-table mediocrity or flirtation with relegation.

===1970s and 1980s===
With talented players including [[Bruno Conti]], Agostino Di Bartolomei and Falcao, Roma would begin the 1980s in its best position to challenge for the title since 1942. After narrowly missing out in 1981, they finally broke through in 1983 amidst joyous celebrations in the capital. They reached the European Cup final the following year, only to lose to Liverpool on penalties.

They have more or less remained in the top half of Serie A ever since, occasionally mounting a serious challenge for the title. As of 2005-06, Roma have set the Serie A record for consecutive wins, beating Lazio 2-0 in the [[Rome derby]] for their 11th win.

      <comment>/* Formation &amp; background */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fatah - Revolutionary Council''' (better known as the '''Abu Nidal Organization''', after its founder [[Abu Nidal]]) was an international [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization created by a split from [[Fatah]] in [[1974]].

The group is also known as the Arab Revolutionary Brigades, Black June (not to be confused with [[Black September (group)|Black September]]) and the Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Muslims.

== Formation &amp; background ==

Fatah-RC originally formed as a result of the 1974 [[Rejectionist Front]] split in the PLO, after the [[Arafat]]'s Fatah had pushed through amendments of the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]]'s (PLO) goals, that were seen as a step towards compromise with [[Israel]]. Abu Nidal then moved to [[Ba'th]]-ruled [[Iraq]] where he set up the Fatah-RC, which soon began a vicious string of terrorist attacks.

It has not clearly defined its ideological position, but was clearly opposed to any form of compromise or negotiation with Israel. It is known as one of the most uncompromisingly militant Palestinian groups ever. It had an estimated membership of several hundred, but its strength today is not known.

== Fatah-RC attacks ==

During its history, Fatah-RC has carried out  attacks in 20 countries, killing or injuring almost 900 persons. Targets include the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Israel]], moderate [[Palestinian]]s, the [[PLO]], and various [[Arab]] and [[Europe]]an countries. The group has not attacked Western targets since the late 1980s.

Major attacks included the [[Rome and Vienna Airport Attacks]] in December [[1985]], the [[Neve Shalom synagogue]] in [[Istanbul]] and the [[Pan Am]] [[Pan Am Flight 73|Flight 73]] hijacking in [[Karachi]] in September [[1986]], and the City of [[Poros]] day-excursion ship attack in [[Greece]] in July [[1988]].

Fatah-RC has been especially noted for its uncompromising stance on negotiation with Israel, treating anything less than all-out military struggle against Israel as treachery. This led the group to perform numerous attacks against the PLO, which had made clear it accepted a negotiated solution to the conflict. Fatah-RC is believed to have assassinated PLO deputy chief [[Abu Iyad]] and PLO security chief [[Abu Hul]] in [[Tunis]] in January [[1991]]. It assassinated a [[Jordan]]ian diplomat in [[Lebanon]] in January [[1994]] and has been linked to the killing of the PLO representative there. Noted PLO moderate [[Issam Sartawi]] was killed by the Fatah-RC in [[1983]]. In the late 1970s, Fatah-RC also made failed assassination attempt on the present Palestinian [[President of the Palestinian National Authority|president]] and PLO chairman, [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. These attacks, and numerous others, led to the PLO issuing a death sentence ''in absentia'' against Abu Nidal. In the early 1990s, it made an attempt to gain control of a refugee camp in [[Lebanon]], but this was thwarted by PLO organizations.

== Support ==

The group has at various stages received funding from [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], and (until [[1987]]) [[Syria]]. Initially, Fatah-RC was closest to the Iraqi regime, but near the end of the 1970s, it moved closer to Libya. From the early 1980s, some viewed it as a Libyan proxy. As [[Muammar al-Qadhafi|al-Qadhafi]] came under increasing pressure from Western governments for his involvement in international terrorism, Libyan backing dwindled, and the group seems to have been forced by the authorities to remain quiet from the late 1980s. Fatah-RC:s operations in [[Libya]] were finally stopped by local authorities in [[1999]], but by then most of the organization had already left for, or fled to, [[Sudan]] and other Arab countries. The choking of funding from [[Middle East]]ern governments caused the organization to slip away in obscurity. Abu Nidal's failing health also seems to have contributed to this. Abu Nidal lived in [[Baghdad]] from the 1990s. He was found dead in [[2002]] by agents of the [[Iraq]]i regime. According to the Iraqi government he shot himself in the mouth when security services came to arrest him, however, Fatah-RC issued a statement from Beirut, stating their belief that Abu Nidal had been murdered.

Fatah-RC has repeatedly been accused, not least by other Palestinians, of acting as a [[mercenary]] terrorist force rather than as part of a national liberation movement. Many of its attacks are seemingly unrelated to the Palestinian struggle, and international terrorism experts point out that the Fatah-RCC tended to attack Libya's enemies during periods of Libyan support, Iraqi enemies during periods of backing from [[Saddam Hussein]], etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Antibody.png|thumb|180px|Schematic of antibody binding to an [[antigen]]]]
An '''antibody''' is a [[protein]] used by the [[immune system]] to identify and neutralize foreign objects like [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[Virus|viruses]]. Each antibody recognizes a specific [[antigen]] unique to its target. Production of antibodies is referred to as the [[humoral immune system]].

==Definition==
Immunoglobulins are [[glycoprotein]]s in the [[immunoglobulin superfamily]] that function as antibodies. The terms ''antibody'' and ''immunoglobulin'' are often used interchangeably. They are found in the [[blood]] and tissue fluids, as well as many [[secretion]]s. In structure, they are [[globulin]]s (in the &amp;gamma;-region of [[protein electrophoresis]]). They are synthesized and secreted by [[plasma cell]]s that are derived from the [[B cells]] of the immune system. B cells are activated upon binding to their specific antigen and differentiate into [[plasma cells]]. In some cases, the interaction of the B cell with a [[T cell|T helper cell]] is also necessary.

==Structure of the antibody==
Immunoglobulins are heavy plasma proteins, often with added sugar chains (see [[glycosylation]]) on N-terminal (all antibodies) and occasionally O-terminal (IgA1 and IgD) amino acid residues.

The basic unit of each antibody is a [[monomer]]. An antibody can be monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric, pentameric, etc. The monomer is a &quot;Y&quot;-shape molecule that consists of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains connected by [[disulfide bond]]s. 

There are five types of heavy chain: &amp;gamma;, &amp;delta;, &amp;alpha;, &amp;mu; and &amp;epsilon;. They define classes of immunoglobulins. Heavy chains &amp;alpha; and &amp;gamma; have approximately 450 [[amino acids]], while &amp;mu; and &amp;epsilon; have approximately 550 amino acids. Each heavy chain has a constant region, which is the same by all immunoglobulins of the same class, and a variable region, which differs between immunoglobulins of different B cells, but is the same for all immunoglobulins produced by the same [[B cell]]. Heavy chains &amp;gamma;, &amp;alpha; and &amp;delta; have the constant region composed of three [[Structural domain|domains]] but have a hinge region; the constant region of heavy chains &amp;mu; and &amp;epsilon; is composed of four domains. The variable domain of any heavy chain is composed of one domain. These domains are about 110 amino acids long. There are also some amino acids between constant domains.

There are only two types of light chain: &amp;lambda; and &amp;kappa;. In humans, they are similar, but only one type is present in each antibody. Each light chain has two successive domains: one constant and one variable domain. The approximate length of a light chain is from 211 to 217 amino acids. 

The monomer is composed of two heavy and two light chains. Together this gives six to eight constant domains and four variable domains. If it is cleaved with enzymes [[papain]]  we get two ''Fab'' (''f''ragment ''a''ntigen ''b''inding) fragments and an ''Fc'' (''f''ragment ''c''rystallizable) fragment, whereas pepsin cleaves below hinge region, so a f(ab)2  fragment and a fc fragment is formed.

Each half of the forked end of the &quot;Y&quot;-shape monomer is called the Fab fragment. It is composed of one constant and one variable domain of each the heavy and the light chain, which together shape the antigen binding site at the [[N-terminal end|amino terminal end]] of the monomer. The two variable domains bind the antigens they are specific for and that elicited their production.  

The ability to bind a wide variety of foreign antigens arises from events known as somatic recombination.  This is when genes are selected (variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) for heavy chains, and only V and J for light chains) to form countless combinations.  The main reason that the human immune system is capable of binding so many antigens is the variable region of the heavy chain.  To be specific, it is the area where these V, D and J genes are found - otherwise known as the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3).

The Fc fragment is the stem of the &quot;Y&quot; and is composed from two heavy chains that each contribute two to three constant domains (depending on the class of the antibody). It binds to various cell [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s and [[Complement system|complement]] proteins. In this way it mediates different physiological effects of antibodies ([[opsonization]], cell [[lysis]], mast cell, basophil and eosinophil [[degranulation]] and other processes).

The variable regions of the heavy and light chains can be fused together to form a [[single chain variable fragment]] (scFv), which retains the original specificity of the parent immunoglobulin.

A crude estimation of immunoglobulin levels can be made by [[protein electrophoresis]]. Here the plasma proteins are separated into [[albumin]], [[alpha-globulin]]s (1 and 2), [[beta-globulin]]s (1 and 2) and [[Gamma globulin|gamma-globulin]]s according to weight. Immunoglobulins are all in the gamma region. In some disease states ([[myeloma]]) a very high concentration of one particular immunoglobulin will show up as a ''[[monoclonal]]'' band.

==Isotypes==
According to differences in their heavy chain constant domains, immunoglobulins are grouped into five classes or isotypes: ''IgG'', ''IgA'', ''IgM'', ''IgD'', and ''IgE''. (The isotypes are also defined with light chains, but they do not define classes, so they are often neglected.) Other immune cells partner with antibodies to eliminate pathogens depending on which IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE constant binding domain receptors it can express on its surface.

The antibodies that a single B lymphocyte produces can differ in their heavy chain and the B cell often expresses different classes of antibodies at the same time. However, they are identical in their specificity for antigen, conferred by their variable region. To achieve the large number of specificities the body needs to protect itself against many different foreign antigens, it must produce millions of B lymphoyctes. It is important to note that, in order to produce such a diversity of antigen binding sites with a separate [[gene]] for each possible antigen, the immune system would require many more genes than exist in the [[genome]]. Instead, as [[Susumu Tonegawa]] showed in 1976, portions of the genome in B lymphocytes can [[Genetic recombination|recombine]] to form all the variation seen in the antibodies and more. Tonegawa won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in [[1987]] for his discovery.

===IgG===
[[Image:IgG_molecular_surface.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Molecular surface of an IgG molecule]]
IgG is a monomeric immunoglobulin, built of two heavy chains &amp;gamma; and two light chains. Each molecule has two antigen binding sites. This is the most abundant immunoglobulin and is approximately equally distributed in [[blood]] and in tissue liquids. This is the only isotype that can pass through the [[placenta]], thereby providing protection to the [[fetus]] in its first weeks of life before its own immune system has developed. It can bind to many kinds of pathogens, for example [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], and [[fungi]], and protects the body against them by complement activation (classic pathway), opsonization for [[phagocytosis]] and [[neutralisation (immunology)|neutralisation]] of their toxins. There are 4 subclasses: IgG1 (66%), IgG2 (23%), IgG3 (7%) and IgG4 (4%).  
-IgG1, IgG3 and IgG4 cross the placenta easily.
-IgG3 is the most effective complement activator, followed by IgG1 and then IgG2. IgG4 does not activate complement.
- IgG1 and IgG3 bind with high affinity to Fc receptors on phagocytic cells. IgG4 has intermediate affinity and IgG2 affinity is extremely low.

===IgA===
IgA represents about 15% to 20% of immunoglobulins in the blood, although it is primarily secreted across the [[mucosal]] tract into the [[stomach]] and [[intestines]]. It is also found in maternal [[milk]], [[tears]] and [[saliva]]. This immunoglobulin helps to fight against pathogens that contact the body surface, are ingested, or are inhaled. It does not activate complement, and opsonises only weakly. Its heavy chains are of the type &amp;alpha;. It exists in two forms, IgA1 (90%) and IgA2 (10%) that differ in the structure. IgA1 is composed like other proteins, however in IgA2 the heavy and light chains are not linked with disulfide but with [[noncovalent]] bonds. Though IgA2 is less in serum, it accounts for major secretory antibody.

The IgA found in secretions have a special form. They are dimeric molecules, linked by two additional chains. One of these is the J chain (from ''j''oin), which is a [[polypeptide]] of  molecular mass 1,5 kD, rich with [[cysteine]] and structurally completely different from other immunoglobulin chains. This chain is formed in the antibodies secreting cells. The dimeric form of IgA in the outer secretions has also a polypeptide of the same molecular mass (1,5 kD) that is called the secretory chain and is produced by the [[epithelial cells]]. It is also possible to find trimeric and even tetrameric IgA.

===IgM===
IgM forms polymers where multiple immunoglobulins are covalently linked together with disulfide bonds, usually as a pentamer or a hexamer. It has a large molecular mass of approximately 900 kD (in its pentamer form). The J chain is attached to most pentamers, while hexamers do not possess the J chain due to space constraints in the complex. Because each monomer has two antigen binding sites, an IgM has 10 of them, however it cannot bind 10 antigens at the same time because they hinder each other.  Because it is a large molecule, it cannot diffuse well, and is found in the interstitium only in very low quantities. IgM is primarily found in serum; however, because of the J chain, it is also important as a secretory immunoglobulin. Due to its polymeric nature, IgM possesses high avidity, and is particularly effective at [[complement system|complement]] activation. It is also a so-called &quot;natural antibody&quot;: it is found in the serum without any evidence of prior contact with antigen.

In germline cells, the gene segment encoding the &amp;mu; constant region of the heavy chain is positioned first among other constant region gene segments. For this reason, IgM is the first immunoglobulin expressed by mature B cells.

===IgD===
IgD makes up about 1% in the plasma membranes in B-lymphocytes. It is monomeric with the &amp;delta; heavy chain. While IgD's function is not yet completely understood, it is often coexpressed with IgM, and is used as a marker of mature, naive B cells. It is believed that, together with membrane bound IgM, IgD functions as the antigen recognition receptor in B cells. It may also be involved in the differentiation of B cells into plasma and memory cells.

===IgE===
[[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]] is a monomeric immunoglobulin with the heavy chain &amp;epsilon;. It contains a high proportion of carbohydrates. Its molecular mass is 190 kD. It can be found on the surface of the plasma membrane of [[basophil granulocyte|basophils]] and [[mast cell]]s of [[connective tissue]]. IgE plays a role in immediate [[hypersensitivity]] and the defense against [[parasite]]s such as worms. The IgE antibodies are present also in outer excretions. They do not activate complement.   Only IgE is heat-labile.

==Function== 

The antibodies have two primary functions:
* they bind antigens -- see [[#The humoral immune response|below]]
* they combine with different immunoglobulin receptors specific for them and exert effector functions. These receptors are isotype-specific, which gives a great flexibility to the immune system, because different situations require only certain immune mechanisms to respond to antigens.
 
Affinity vs Avidity

* Affinity is the binding strength of the antibody to the antigen.
* Avidity is the number of antigen binding sites.

For example, IgG has higher affinity than IgM, but IgM has higher avidity.

===The humoral immune response===
When a [[macrophage]] ingests a [[pathogen]], it attaches parts of the pathogen's [[protein]]s to a [[major histocompatibility complex|class II MHC]] protein. This complex is moved to the outside of the [[cell membrane]], where it can be recognized by a [[T lymphocyte]], which compares it to similar structures on the cell membrane of a [[B lymphocyte]]. If it finds a matching pair, the T lymphocyte activates the B lymphocyte, which starts producing antibodies. A B lymphocyte can produce antibodies only against the structure it presents on its surface.

Antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream or bound to cell membranes.  They are part of the [[humoral immune system]]. Antibodies exist in clonal lines that are specific to only one [[antigen]], e.g., a virus hull protein. In binding to such antigens, they can cause [[agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] and [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of antibody-antigen products primed for phagocytosis by [[macrophages]] and other cells, [[antagonism|block]] viral receptors, and stimulate other [[immune response]]s, such as the [[complement system|complement pathway]].

Antibodies that recognize viruses can block these directly by their sheer size. The virus will be unable to dock to a cell and infect it, hindered by the antibody. They can also agglutinate them so the phagocytes can capture them.
Antibodies that recognize bacteria mark them for ingestion by macrophages. Together with the [[blood plasma|plasma]] component [[complement system|complement]], antibodies can kill bacteria directly. They neutralize toxins by binding with them.

It is important to note that antibodies cannot attack pathogens within cells, and certain viruses &quot;hide&quot; inside cells (as part of the [[lysogenic cycle]]) for long periods of time to avoid them.  This is the reason for the chronic nature of many minor skin diseases (such as [[cold sores]]); any given outbreak is quickly suppressed by the immune system, but the infection is never truly eradicated because some cells retain viruses that will resume the apparent symptoms later.

==Medical applications==
Detection of particular antibodies is a very common form of medical diagnostics. [[Serology]] depends on these methods. [[Autoimmune disorder]]s can often be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through [[blood test]]s.

&quot;Designed&quot; [[monoclonal antibody]] therapy is already being employed in a number of diseases (including [[rheumatoid arthritis]]) and in some forms of [[cancer]]. [[As of 2005|Presently]], many antibody-related therapies are undergoing extensive [[clinical trial]]s for use in practice.

==Biochemical applications==
In [[biochemistry]], antibodies are used for immunological identification of proteins, using the [[Western blot]] method.  A similar technique is used in [[ELISPOT]] and [[ELISA]] assays, in which detection antibodies are used to detect cell secretions such as cytokines or antibodies. Antibodies are also used to separate proteins (and anything bound to them) from the other molecules in a cell lysate. 

These purified antibodies are often produced by injecting the antigen into a small mammal, such as a mouse or rabbit. Blood isolated from these animals contains ''[[polyclonal antibody|polyclonal antibodies]]'' -- multiple antibodies that stick to the same antigen. The [[serum]] (=blood from which blood-clotting proteins and red-blood cells were removed), also known as the [[antiserum]], because it now contains the desired antibodies, is commonly purified with Protein A/G purification or antigen affinity chromatography. If the lymphocytes that produce the antibodies can be isolated and immortalized, then a ''[[monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]]'' can be obtained.

Antibodies are also widely used in [[immunohistochemical staining]].

'''Alessandro Scarlatti''' ([[May 2]], [[1660]] &amp;ndash; [[October 24]], [[1725]]) was a [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[composer]] especially famous for his [[opera]]s and chamber [[cantata]]s.  He is considered the founder of the [[Neapolitan]] school of opera.  He was the father of two other Baroque composers, [[Domenico Scarlatti]] and [[Pietro Filippo Scarlatti]].

==Life==

Scarlatti was born in Sicily, either in [[Trapani]] or [[Palermo]]. He is generally said to have been a pupil of [[Giacomo Carissimi]] in [[Rome]], and there is reason to suppose that he had some connection with northern Italy, since his early works show the influence of [[Alessandro Stradella|Stradella]] and [[Giovanni Legrenzi|Legrenzi]]. The production at Rome of his opera ''Gli Equivoci nell&amp;rsquo;amore'' ([[1679]]) gained him the protection of Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] (who at the time was living in Rome), and he became her ''maestro di cappella''. In February [[1684]] he became ''maestro di cappella'' to the [[viceroy]] of [[Naples]], through the influence of his sister, an opera singer, who was the mistress of an influential Neapolitan noble. Here he produced a long series of [[opera]]s, remarkable chiefly for their fluency and expressiveness, as well as other music for state occasions. 

In [[1702]] Scarlatti left Naples and did not return until the Spanish domination had been superseded by that of the Austrians. In the interval he enjoyed the patronage of [[Ferdinand III of Tuscany]], for whose private theatre near [[Florence]] he composed operas, and of [[Cardinal Ottoboni]], who made him his ''maestro di cappella'', and procured him a similar post at the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome in [[1703]]. 

After visiting [[Venice]] and [[Urbino]] in [[1707]], Scarlatti took up his duties at Naples again in [[1708]], and remained there until [[1717]]. By this time Naples seems to have become tired of his music; the Romans, however, appreciated it better, and it was at the [[Teatro Capranica]] in Rome that he produced some of his finest operas (''Telemaco'', [[1718]]; ''Marco Attilio Regolò'', [[1719]]; ''[[Griselda]]'', [[1721]]), as well as some noble specimens of church music, including a [[mass (music)|mass]] for chorus and orchestra, composed in honor of [[Saint Cecilia]] for [[Cardinal Acquaviva]] in 1721.   His last work on a large scale appears to have been the unfinished [[serenata]] for the marriage of the prince of [[Stigliano]] in [[1723]]. Scarlatti died in Naples.

==Scarlatti's music==

Scarlatti's music forms an important link between the early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] Italian vocal styles of the [[17th century]], with their centers in [[Florence]], [[Venice]] and [[Rome]], and the classical school of the [[18th century]], which culminated in [[Mozart]]. His early operas (''Gli Equivoci nel sembiante'' [[1679]]; ''L&amp;rsquo;Honestà negli amori'' [[1680]], containing the famous aria &quot;Già il sole dal Gange&quot;; ''Pompeo'' [[1683]], containing the well-known airs &quot;O cessate di piagarmi&quot; and &quot;Toglietemi la vita ancor,&quot; and others down to about [[1685]]) retain the older cadences in their [[recitatives]], and a considerable variety of neatly constructed forms in their charming little arias, accompanied sometimes by the string quartet, treated with careful elaboration, sometimes by the harpsichord alone. By [[1686]] he had definitely established the &quot;Italian overture&quot; form (second edition of ''Dal male il bene''), and had abandoned the [[ground bass]] and the [[Binary (music)|binary form]] air in two stanzas in favour of the [[ternary form]] or [[da capo]] type of air.  His best operas of this period are ''La Rosaura'' ([[1690]], printed by the [[Gesellschaft für Musikforschung]]), and ''Pirro e Demetrio'' ([[1694]]), in which occur the arias &quot;Rugiadose, odorose&quot;, and &quot;Ben ti sta, traditor&quot;.

From about [[1697]] onwards (''La Caduta del decemviri''), influenced partly perhaps by the style of [[Giovanni Bononcini]] and probably more by the taste of the viceregal court, his opera arias become more conventional and commonplace in rhythm, while his scoring is hasty and crude, yet not without brilliance (''Eracles'', [[1700]]), the [[Oboe|oboes]] and [[Trumpet|trumpets]] being frequently used, and the [[Violin|violins]] often playing in unison. The operas composed for [[Ferdinand de' Medici]] are lost; they might have given a more favourable idea of his style as his correspondence with the prince shows that they were composed with a very sincere sense of inspiration. 

''Mitridate Eupatore'', accounted his masterpiece, composed for Venice in [[1707]], contains music far in advance of anything that Scarlatti had written for Naples, both in technique and in intellectual power. The later Neapolitan operas (''L'Amor volubile e tiranno'' [[1700]]; ''La Principessa fedele'' [[1712]]; ''Tigrane'', [[1715]], &amp;c.) are showy and effective rather than profoundly emotional; the instrumentation marks a great advance on previous work, since the main duty of accompanying the voice is thrown upon the string quartet, the harpsichord being reserved exclusively for the noisy instrumental [[ritornelli]]. In his opera ''Teodora'' ([[1697]]) he originated the use of the orchestral ''ritornello''.  

His last group of operas, composed for Rome, exhibit a deeper poetic feeling, a broad and dignified style of melody, a strong dramatic sense, especially in accompanied recitatives, a device which he himself had been the first to use as early as [[1686]] (''Olimpia vendicata'') and a much more modern style of orchestration, the horns appearing for the first time, and being treated with striking effect.

Besides the operas, [[oratorio]]s (''Agar et Ismaele esiliati'', [[1684]]; ''Christmas Oratorio'', c. [[1705]]; ''S. Filippo Neri'', [[1714]]; and others) and [[serenata]]s, which all exhibit a similar style, Scarlatti composed upwards of five hundred chamber-cantatas for solo voice. These represent the most intellectual type of chamber-music of their period, and it is to be regretted that they have remained almost entirely in manuscript, since a careful study of them is indispensable to anyone who wishes to form an adequate idea of Scarlatti's development. 

His few remaining masses (the story of his having composed two hundred is hardly credible) and church music in general are comparatively unimportant, except the great ''St Cecilia Mass'' ([[1721]]), which is one of the first attempts at the style which reached its height in the great masses of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]. His instrumental music, though not without interest, is curiously antiquated as compared with his vocal works.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''''' is a collection of annals narrating the history of the [[Anglo-Saxons]] and their settlement in [[Britain]]. Much of the information in these documents consists of rumours of events that happened elsewhere and so may be unreliable. However for some periods and places, the chronicle is the only substantial surviving source of information. The manuscripts were produced in different places, and each manuscript represents the biases of its scribes. The chronicle has entries spanning [[1|AD 1]] to [[1154]], and two manuscripts have an entry - misdated - for [[60 BC]], recording [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] invasion of Britain. The term Anglo-Saxon appears to be a later addition, as the first printed edition (1692) was called &quot;Chronicum saxonicum.&quot; 

After the original chronicle was compiled, copies were kept at various [[Monastery|monasteries]] and were updated independently. Sometimes items important to the locals, such as the fertility of the harvest or the paucity of bees, would be eagerly recorded, whereas distant political events could be overlooked. A combination of the individual annals allows us to develop an overall picture, a document that was the first continuous history written by Europeans in their own language. Thus the various versions of the chronicle are an important development in [[historiography]] as well as a useful historical documents in their own right.

There are nine surviving manuscripts (including two copies), of which eight are written entirely in [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]], while the ninth is in Anglo-Saxon with a translation of each annal into [[Latin]].  One (the [[Peterborough Chronicle]]) contains early [[Middle English]] as well as Anglo-Saxon.  The oldest (Corp. Chris. MS 173) is known as the '''Parker Chronicle''', after [[Matthew Parker]] who once owned it, or the '''Winchester Chronicle'''. 

The surviving manuscripts are:

*Version A: ''The Parker Chronicle'' (Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS. 173); Cottonian Fragment (British Museum, Cotton MS. Otho B xi, 2)
*Version B: ''The Abingdon Chronicle I'' (British Museum, Cotton MS. Tiberius A vi.)
*Version C: ''The Abingdon Chronicle II'' (British Museum, Cotton MS. Tiberius B i.)
*Version D: ''The Worcester Chronicle'' (British Museum, Cotton MS. Tiberius B iv.)
*Version E: ''The Laud'' (or &quot;[[Peterborough Chronicle|Peterborough]]&quot;) Chronicle (Bodleian, MS. Laud 636)
*Version F: ''The Bilingual Canterbury Epitome'' (British Museum, Cotton MS. Domitian A viii.)  - entries in English and Latin.
*Version H: Cottonian Fragment (British Museum, Cotton MS. Domitian A ix.)
*Version I: ''An Easter Table Chronicle'' (British Museum, Cotton MS. Caligula A xv.)

Version A is of particular importance for the dating of the chronicle. The manuscript is in the handwriting of some thirteen or fourteen scribes and the first scribe wrote as far as 891. For this reason the composition of the chronicle is generally dated to the reign of King [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]].

Some of the annals are derived from earlier sources such as [[Prosper of Aquitaine|Prosper]] and [[Bede]] and the annal for 430 demonstrates this:

[[Prosper of Aquitaine]] wrote that in [[430]]: “Palladius was sent by [[Pope Celestine I|Pope Celestine]] to the Scots who believed in [[Christ]], and was ordained as their first bishop”. This story was known to Bede and was repeated by him: “In the year 430 Palladius was sent by [[Pope Celestine]] to the [[Scots]] that believed in Christ to be their first bishop”. This annal was then copied into the earliest version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (version A, compiled in 891): “430. In this year bishop Palladius was sent by Pope Celestine to the Scots to strengthen their faith”. But during the twelfth century the manuscript was altered to read: “… Palladius (vel Patricius)…”. In another version of the chronicle (version E, written in 1121) Palladius disappears and is replaced by Patrick: “430. In this year Patrick was sent by pope Celestine to preach baptism to the Scots”. 

Notice how with each scribe the story changes a little, so starting from [[Palladius]] being sent to the Irish who were already Christian, it eventually becomes a tale about [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]] being sent to convert the Irish.

Other annals were simply invented. Under 477 we read that Wlencing was the son of Ælle, but Wlencing is a patronymic meaning ‘son of Wlenca’, so he cannot also have been son of Ælle! Clearly the chronicler has carelessly extracted Wlencing from an early form of the place-name Lancing. Moving on to 501, [[Portsmouth]] is located at the mouth of a port; it is not named after Port; he was quarried out of the place-name. Then under 508 Natanleag means ‘wet meadow’, so it was not named after a slain Welsh king called Natanleod; he is an invention. And under 514 we find Wihtgar, who in 534 is given the Isle of Wight, and in 544 is buried at Wihtgaraburg. But Wihtgaraburg does not mean 'Wihtgar's fortress' but 'the fortress of the inhabitants of Wight', and Wight itself is derived from Romano-British ''Vectis'' (Ekwall 1947). Clearly, if these annals are fiction, as they plainly are, then the other early annals are suspect.

The translated texts (together with explanatory materials) are available in books and on the Internet, so scholars at all levels can now consult them directly.

'''Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd.''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] luxury [[car]] manufacturer based in [[Newport Pagnell]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. The company name was derived from the ''Aston'' Clinton [[hillclimbing|Hillclimb]] course and founder Lionel ''Martin''. Up to the year 2003, approximately 20,200 cars had been built by Aston Martin.  Today, the company is part of the [[Premier Automotive Group]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]].

===Foundation===
Aston Martin was founded in [[1914]] by [[Lionel Martin]] and Robert Bamford. The two had joined forces as Bamford &amp; Martin the previous year to sell cars made by [[Singer (car)|Singer]] from premises in Callow Street, London. Martin raced specials at the [[Aston Hill]]  near [[Aston Clinton]], and the pair decided to make their own vehicles. They acquired premises at Henniker Place in [[Kensington]] and produced their first car in March [[1915]].  Production could not start because of World War 1 and Martin joined the Admiralty and Bamford the Royal Army Service Corps. All machinery was sold to the Sopwith Aircraft Company.

===Inter war years===
After the war hiatus, the company was refounded at Abingdon Road, Kensington and a new car designed which would carry the Aston-Martin name. Bamford left in 1920 and the company was revitalised with funding from [[Count Louis Zborowski]]. In [[1922]], Bamford &amp; Martin produced cars to compete in the [[French Grand Prix]], and the cars set world speed and endurance records at [[Brooklands]]. The company went bankrupt in 1924 and was bought by Lady Charnwood who put her son John Benson on the board. The company failed again in 1925 and the factory closed in 1926 with Lionel Martin leaving. 

Later that year, a number of rich investors, including Lady Charnwood, took control of the company and renamed it Aston Martin Motors, and moved the firm to the former [[Citroen]] plant in [[Feltham]]. John Benson brought in Augusto Benelli as designer. The [[1929]] Aston Martin International was another successful racer and was followed by the [[Le Mans]] and the [[Ulster]]. Financial problems reappeared in 1932 and the company was rescued by L Prideaux Brune who funded it for the following year before passing the company on to Sir Artur Sutherland.  In [[1936]], the company decided to concentrate on road cars. Car production had always been on a small scale and from the company's founding until the advent of [[World War II]] halted work only about 700 had been made. During the war years aircraft components were made.

===The David Brown era===
In [[1947]], [[David Brown Limited]] bought the company under the leadership of managing director Sir [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]] &amp;mdash; its &quot;post-war saviour&quot;. David Brown also acquired [[Lagonda]] that year, and both companies shared resources and workshops. In [[1954]], David Brown bought the site at Tickford Street in [[Newport Pagnell]], and that was the beginning of the classic series of cars bearing the initials 'DB'. In [[1950]], the company announced the [[Aston Martin DB2|DB2]], followed by the racing [[Aston Martin DB3|DB3]] in [[1957]] and the Italian-styled 3.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Aston Martin DB4|DB4]] in [[1958]]. All the cars established a good racing pedigree for the firm, but the DB4 was the key to establishing the company's reputation&amp;mdash;which was cemented with the famous [[Aston Martin DB5|DB5]] in [[1963]]. The company continued developing the &quot;grand touring&quot; style with the [[Aston Martin DB6|DB6]] (1965&amp;ndash;70), the [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS]], and the [[Aston Martin V8|DBS V8]] (1967&amp;ndash;72).  The latter was subsequently renamed the [[Aston Martin Vantage|Vantage]].

===Changing ownership===
Despite the cars' appreciation in value, the company was often financially troubled. In [[1972]], it was sold to a [[Birmingham]]-based consortium, and resold in [[1975]] to the North American businessmen Peter Sprague and George Minden. The new American owners pushed the company into modernizing its line, producing the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|V8 Vantage]] in [[1977]], the convertible [[Aston Martin V8|Volante]] in [[1978]], and the one-off William Towns-styled [[Aston Martin Bulldog|Bulldog]] in [[1980]]. Towns also styled the futuristic new [[Aston Martin Lagonda|Lagonda]] saloon, based on the existing V8 model. The Americans sold the company to CH Industrial, who themselves turned the company over in [[1983]] to Automotive Investments who, in turn, lasted barely a year before selling the company to Peter Livanos and company chairman Victor Gauntlett. At last, in [[1986]], the [[Ford Motor Company]] purchased 75 per cent of the company, later gaining complete control of the company.

In [[1988]], having produced some 5,000 cars in twenty years, the company finally retired the ancient V8 and introduced the [[Aston Martin Virage|Virage]] range. In [[1992]], the [[Aston Martin Virage#Vantage|Vantage]] version was announced, and the following year the company renewed the DB range by announcing the [[Aston Martin DB7|DB7]].

===The Ford era===
In [[1993]], Ford finally bought Victor Gauntlett's shares and took full control of the firm, placing it in the [[Premier Automotive Group|Ford Premier Automotive Group]]. Ford substantially invested in new manufacturing and quickly ramped-up production. In 1994, Ford opened a new factory at Banbury Road in [[Bloxham]]. In [[1995]], the company produced a record 700 vehicles, in [[1998]] the 2,000th DB7 was built, and in [[2002]] the 6,000th &amp;mdash; exceeding production of all previous DB models. The DB7 range was boosted by the addition of [[Aston Martin DB7|V12 Vantage]] models in [[1999]], and in [[2001]] the company introduced the V12-engine [[Aston Martin Vanquish|Vanquish]].

2003 was a significant year for Aston Martin. At the North American International Auto Show in [[Detroit, Michigan]], U.S.A., Aston Martin introduced the new [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005)|AMV8 Vantage]] concept car. Expected to have few changes before its introduction in 2005, the new AMV8 Vantage brings back the classic V8 engine and will allow the company to compete in a larger market. The year also saw the opening of the [[Gaydon]] factory, the first purpose-built factory in Aston Martin's history. Also introduced in 2003, was the new [[Aston Martin DB9|DB9]] coupé, which replaces the ten-year-old DB7. A convertible version of the DB9, known as the DB9 Volante, was introduced at the 2004 Detroit Auto Show.

In December 2003, Aston Martin announced they would return to motor racing in 2005. A new division was created, called [[Aston Martin Racing]], who will be responsible, together with [[Prodrive]], for the design, development, and management of the DBR9 program. The DBR9 will compete in the GT class in [[sports car racing|sports car races]] including the world-famous [[24 hours of Le Mans]].


== Models ==
Aston Martin's model naming can be confusing to the uninitiated.  In general, high performance models use the &quot;[[Aston Martin Vantage (disambiguation)|Vantage]]&quot; name, while convertibles are called ''Volante''.

== Astons on film ==

The very British glamour of Aston Martin cars meant they were a natural choice for the [[James Bond]] series of action films, notably the silver DB5 that appears in ''[[Goldfinger]]'' (1964) and ''[[Thunderball]]'' (1965) as James Bond's company car, and then in ''[[GoldenEye]]'' (1995) and ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997) as his private car. In ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1969) there appears, for a short time, a charcoal grey DBS. After an interlude with [[Lotus (car)|Lotus]], Aston Martins were again used, a charcoal grey Volante in ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' (1987), and, after another hiatus, the Vanquish appeared in ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002). In early 2004, Henrik Fisker, Design Director at Aston Martin, revealed that James Bond will be driving the new DBS [http://www.classicdriver.com/uk/magazine/3300.asp?id=12807] in [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]] to be released in 2006.

''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969) features a silver DB4 Convertible, owned by crook Charlie Croker, played by [[Michael Caine]]. Later, this car is destroyed in a [[Mafia]] ambush, along with a pair of [[E-type Jaguar]]s. The cars were meant to serve as getaway vehicles in the subsequent robbery &quot;in case anything goes wrong.&quot; The gang decide to proceed despite this loss, and the question of what happens if anything goes wrong is pointedly ignored by Croker. Interestingly, the filming of the Aston going over the cliff was not considered dramatic enough by the director (due to the explosion looking too &quot;faked&quot;) and so rather than destroy another Aston, a [[Lancia]] mocked up to look like its British counterpart was pushed over the edge for the second take. In the 2003 remake with the same title, the character Handsome Rob, played by Jason Statham, ends up driving an Aston Martin, but not the Vanquish that he wanted. Instead, it is a DB7 Volante.

An Aston Martin also appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.

Aston Martin has also had a presence in the toy industry; one of the most famous toy cars ever was the ''Corgi James Bond Aston Martin DB5'', pictured here. First released in 1965 and then re-released some years later, it has provided many generations of children with a taste of the Aston Martin legend.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Albert Pike''' (born [[December 29]], [[1809]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]; died [[April 2]], [[1891]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]) was an [[attorney-at-law|attorney]], soldier, writer, and [[freemasonry|Freemason]].  Albert Pike is the only [[Confederate States Army|Confederate military]] officer or figure to be honored with a statue in Washington D.C.  The statue sits in Judiciary Square.

==Biography==
Pike was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], son of Benjamin and Sarah (Andrews) Pike, and spent his childhood in [[Byfield, Massachusetts|Byfield]] and [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]]. He attended school in Newburyport and [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]] until he was 15, at which point, having passed the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] entrance exam but unable to afford tuition, he began a program of self-education, later becoming a schoolteacher in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]], [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts|Fairhaven]] and Newburyport.

In 1831 Pike left Massachusetts to travel west, first stopping in [[Saint Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and later moving on to [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], [[Missouri]].  In Independence, he joined an expedition to [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], [[New Mexico]], hunting and trading.  During the excursion his horse broke and ran, forcing Pike to walk the remaining 500 miles to Taos. After this he joined a trapping expedition to the [[Llano Estacado]] in New Mexico and [[Texas]].  Trapping was minimal, and after traveling about 1300 miles (650 on foot), he finally arrived at [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], [[Arkansas]].

Settling in Arkansas in 1833, he taught school and wrote a series of articles for [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] ''Arkansas Advocate'' under the [[pen name]] of &quot;Casca.&quot;  The articles were popular enough that he was asked to join the staff of the newspaper.  Later, after marrying Mary Ann Hamilton, he purchased part of the newspaper with the dowry. By 1835 he was the ''Advocate''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s sole owner. Under Pike's administration the ''Advocate'' promoted the viewpoint of the [[United States Whig Party|Whig party]] in a politically volatile and divided Arkansas. 

He then began to study law, and was admitted to the bar in 1837, selling the ''Advocate'' the same year.  He was the first reporter for the Arkansas supreme court, and also wrote a book (published anonymously), titled ''The Arkansas Form Book'', which was a guidebook for lawyers.

===Military career===
When the [[Mexican-American War]] started, Pike joined the cavalry and was commissioned as a troop commander, serving in the [[Battle of Buena Vista]].  He and his commander, [[John Selden Roane]], had several differences of opinion.  This situation led finally to a [[duel]] between Pike and Roane.  Although several shots were fired in the duel, nobody was injured, and the two were persuaded by their seconds to discontinue it.

After the war, Pike returned to the practice of law, moving to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] for a time beginning in 1853.   He wrote another book, ''Maxims of the Roman Law and some of the Ancient French Law, as Expounded and Applied in Doctrine and Jurisprudence''. Although unpublished, this book increased his reputation among his associates in law. He returned to Arkansas in 1857, gaining some amount of prominence in the legal field and becoming an advocate of [[slavery]], although retaining his affiliation with the Whig party.  When that party dissolved, he became a member of the [[United States Know-Nothing Party|Know-Nothing]] party.  Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] he was firmly against secession, but when the war started he nevertheless took the side of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

He also made several contacts among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the area, at one point negotiating an $800,000 settlement between the [[Creek (people)|Creek]]s and other tribes and the federal government.  This relationship was to influence the course of his Civil War service. At the beginning of the war, Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to the Native Americans.  In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one of the most important being with [[Cherokee]] chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], which was concluded in 1861.  

Pike was commissioned as a [[brigadier general]] on [[November 22]], [[1861]], and given a command in the [[Indian Territory]].  With Gen. [[Benjamin McCulloch|Ben McCullough]], Pike trained three Confederate regiments of [[Indian cavalry]], most of whom belonged to the &quot;[[Five Civilized Tribes|civilized tribes]],&quot; whose loyalty to the Confederacy was variable.  Although victorious at the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] (Elkhorn Tavern) in March, Pike's unit was defeated later in a counterattack, after falling into disarray.  Also, as in the previous war, Pike came into conflict with his superior officers, at one point drafting a letter to [[Jefferson Davis]] complaining about his direct superior.

After Pea Ridge, Pike was faced with charges that his troops had scalped soldiers in the field.  Maj. Gen. [[Thomas C. Hindman]] also charged Pike with mishandling of money and materiel, ordering his arrest.  Both these charges were later found to be considerably lacking in evidence; nevertheless Pike, facing arrest, escaped into the hills of Arkansas, sending his resignation from the Confederate Army on July 12. He was at length arrested on November 3 under charges of [[insubordination]] and [[treason]], and held briefly in [[Warren, Texas]], but his resignation was accepted on November 11 and he was allowed to return to Arkansas.

===After the war===
Pike faced the postwar years unable to earn the trust either of his former comrades or of the Union victors, and subsequently relocated to [[New York]] and later to [[Canada]].  He was however at length given a formal pardon by [[Andrew Johnson]] on August 30, 1865, and therefore enabled to continue his career in public life, becoming an associate justice of the Arkansas supreme court, later practicing law in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] from 1867-8 (where he also served as editor of the Memphis ''Appeal''), and finally moving his law office to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1870, becoming editor of the ''Patriot'' newspaper.

[[Image:AlbertPikeOlder.jpeg|thumb|Pike in Masonic regalia]]

===In Freemasonry===
He had in the interim joined a Masonic lodge and become extremely active in the affairs of the organization, being elected Sovereign Grand Commander of the [[Scottish Rite]]'s Southern Jurisdiction in 1859, also that year having received an honorary Ph.D. from Harvard.  He remained Sovereign Grand Commander for the remainder of his life (a total of 32 years), devoting a large amount of his time to perfection of the rituals of the order.  Notably, he published a book called ''[[Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry]]'' in 1872, of which there were several subsequent editions.

Additionally, Pike wrote on several legal subjects, and continued producing poetry, a hobby he had begun in his youth in Massachusetts.  His poems were highly regarded in his day, but are now mostly forgotten.  Several volumes of his works were self-published posthumously by his daughter.

Pike died in Washington, D.C. and was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery (against his wishes&amp;mdash;he had left instructions his body be cremated).
In [[1944]] his remains were moved to the [[House of the Temple]], headquarters of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite.

===Albert Pike and the Ku Klux Klan===

Albert Pike has been accused of being a founder and high ranking member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]; however, There is no evidence of this and the claim appears to be based on the unsubstantiated writings of Klan appologist Walter Fleming and revivalist Susan Davis.

One of the Klan founders, Captain John C. Lester, wrote a 119 page book in 1884, in which he recalled the founding of the Klan fifteen years before. The only person that Lester mentioned was &quot;Gen. Forrest,&quot; undoubtedly referring to [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. Lester does not mention Pike.

Dr. Walter L. Fleming republished Lester's memoir in 1905 and added a list of names and pictures of &quot;Klansmen.&quot; These included Pike but also Rev. D.L. Wilson who had been Lester's co-author but not a Klansman. Thus if the inclusion of Pike on the list was a mistake, then it was not Fleming's only one. 

Susan L. Davis published her &quot;Authentic History&quot; of the Klan in 1924. She disagreed with Lester and regarded Fleming as not knowledgeable about the Klan. She also said that David L. Wilson, was wrong to say that the original Klan was a failure. (This is not surpirsing since Davis was actively supporting a revival of the Klan at the time of her publication.)

Virtually all books or articles that claim Pike was part of the Ku Klux Klan use Fleming, Davis, other authors who cite Fleming or Davis, or else use no sources whatsoever. As one source puts it, &quot;Research into primary source material will reveal that there isn't any primary source material&quot; that proves or disproves Pike's association with the Klan. It is noteworthy that when the Klan was founded in Pulaski, Tennessee around Christmas 1865, Pike was living in in Arkansas, and there is no record of him journeying to or being in Pulaski.

===Conspiracy theories===

Pike's contributions to the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States, combined with his unique life and written works, has made him a person of note in virtually every conspiracy theory that mentions Freemasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:alanmoore.jpg|thumb|right|Alan Moore.]]

'''Alan Moore''' (born [[November 18]], [[1953]], in [[Northampton]], [[England]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[writer]] most famous for his work in [[comics]], including the acclaimed [[graphic novel]]s ''[[Watchmen]]'', ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and  ''[[From Hell]]''. He has also written a novel, ''[[Voice of the Fire]]'', and performs &quot;workings&quot; (one-off performance art/spoken word pieces) with the [[Moon and Serpent Grand Egyptian Theatre of Marvels]].

As a comics writer, Moore is renowned for bringing more mature, literary sensibilities to a medium often dismissed as juvenile and trivial. As well as including literary influences, adult themes and challenging subject matter, he also experiments with the form of comics, employing effects unique to the medium, and creating different ways to combine text and image. He brings a wide range of influences to his work, including authors such as [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Thomas Pynchon]] and [[Iain Sinclair]], [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]] [[science fiction]] writers like [[Michael Moorcock]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] writers like [[Clive Barker]], and film-editing techniques from the work of directors like [[Nicolas Roeg]]. Comics artist [[Bryan Talbot]], whose ''[[The Adventures of Luther Arkwright]]'' anticipated the adult comics movement, is also undoubtedly a major influence. Some of Moore's superhero work in the 1980s borrows thematic elements from [[Robert Mayer]]'s novel ''[[Super-Folks]]''.

Moore is a practising [[magician]], and claims to worship a Roman snake-deity named [[Glykon]].

==Career==
===Early work===
[[Image:Warrior2.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Warrior (comic)|Warrior]]''#2, art by [[Garry Leach]].]]
Having been expelled from school aged 17 for dealing [[LSD|acid]],{{ref|acid}} Moore spent the next several years in menial jobs before embarking on a career as a [[cartoonist]] in the late 1970s. He wrote and drew [[Underground comics|underground]]-style strips for music magazines like ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' and the ''[[NME]]'' under the pseudonym [[Kurt Weill|Curt Vile]], sometimes in collaboration with his friend [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]] (no relation). Under the pseudonym [[Gilles de Rais|Jill de Ray]] he began a weekly strip, ''[[Maxwell the Magic Cat]]'', for the [[Northants Post]] newspaper, which continued until 1986.

Deciding he could not make a living as an artist, he concentrated on writing, providing scripts for [[Marvel UK]], ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' and ''[[Warrior (comic)|Warrior]]''. At Marvel he wrote short strips for ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]] Weekly'' before beginning a celebrated run on ''[[Captain Britain]]'' with artist [[Alan Davis]], running in a variety of Marvel UK publications. At ''2000 AD'' he started by writing one-off ''[[Future Shocks]]'' and ''Time Twisters'', moving on to series such as ''[[Skizz]]'' (''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'' as written by [[Alan Bleasdale]], with [[Jim Baikie]]), ''[[D.R. and Quinch]]'' (a sci-fi take on [[National Lampoon]]'s characters O.C. and Stiggs, with Davis) and ''[[The Ballad of Halo Jones]]'' (the first series in the comic to be based around a female character, with [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]]). The last two proved amongst the most popular strips to appear in ''2000 AD'' but Moore became increasingly concerned at his lack of creator's rights, and in 1986 stopped writing for ''2000 AD'', leaving the ''Halo Jones'' story incomplete. The theme of fallings out with publishers on matters of principle would become a common one in Moore's later career.

Of his work during this period, it is the work he produced for ''Warrior'' that attracted greater critical acclaim; ''[[Marvelman]]'' (later retitled Miracleman for legal reasons), a radical re-imagining of a forgotten 1950s [[superhero]] drawn by [[Garry Leach]] and [[Alan Davis]]; ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', a [[dystopian]] pulp adventure about a flamboyant [[anarchist]] terrorist who dresses as [[Guy Fawkes]] and fights a future [[British]] [[fascist]] government, illustrated by [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]]; and ''[[The Bojeffries Saga]]'', a comedy about a working-class English family of [[vampires]] and [[werewolves]], drawn by [[Steve Parkhouse]].  ''Warrior'' closed before these stories were completed, but he was able to continue them with other publishers.

===American mainstream===
[[Image:Killingjoke.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Cover art for ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' by [[Brian Bolland]].]]

Moore's British work brought him to the attention of DC Comics [[editor]] [[Len Wein]], who hired him in 1983 to write ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', then a fairly formulaic monster comic, and also one of the poorest selling of DC's titles at the time. Moore, along with artists [[Stephen R. Bissette]], [[Rick Veitch]] and [[John Totleben]], deconstructed and rebuilt the character from the ground up, writing a series of formally experimental stories that addressed environmental and social issues alongside the horror and fantasy.

Once it was clear that Moore had revitalised ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' and that he brought great critical acclaim, he was given new assignments by DC. These included backup [[Green Arrow]] (in ''[[Detective Comics]]'') and [[Omega Men]] stories, a two part story in ''[[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]'', plus various [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] stories. The most acclaimed of this work was the final two part Superman story (''[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]'')  before [[John Byrne]]'s revamp in 1986 and ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'' with artist [[Brian Bolland]].

It was with the limited series ''[[Watchmen]]'', begun in 1986 and collected as a graphic novel in 1987, that he cemented his reputation. Imagining what the world would be like if superheroes had really existed since the 1940s, Moore and artist [[Dave Gibbons]] created a twisted [[Cold War]] mystery in which the shadow of [[nuclear war]] threatens the world.  The heroes who are caught up in this escalating crisis either work for the [[United States of America|U.S.]] government or are outlawed; they are variously neurotic, amoral, sexually dysfunctional, borderline-fascistic and, ultimately, woefully human. ''Watchmen'' is formally ambitious, densely written, intricately constructed, non-linear and told from multiple points of view; it is a rare example of a [[graphic novel]] that in its scope and depth can be genuinely considered a [[novel]] in comics form.  Moore was widely acclaimed for revitalising the medium, not least in his decision to tackle dense philosophical issues such as predestination, free will and moral reasoning, which previously had not been so skillfully broached in a mainstream comic.

[[Image:V for vendettax.jpg|thumb|150px|Cover art for the collected edition of ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' by [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]].]]

''Watchmen'' is also notable for widening the rift between Moore and DC Comics which originated during Moore's tenure as writer on ''Swamp Thing''.  DC marketed a limited edition badge set featuring characters and images from the series, as well as the iconic 'smiley badge' featured in the series. This badge set caused friction between Moore and DC - the publisher claimed that they were a &quot;promotional item&quot; and not merchandising, and therefore DC did not pay Moore or Gibbons any royalties from the sale of the sets.

Alongside roughly contemporaneous work such as [[Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', [[Art Spiegelman]]'s ''[[Maus (comics)|Maus]]'' and [[Jaime Hernandez|Jaime]] and [[Gilbert Hernandez]]'s ''[[Love and Rockets (comics)|Love and Rockets]]'', ''Watchmen'' was part of a late 1980s trend towards comics with more adult sensibilities. Moore briefly became a media celebrity, and the resulting attention led to him withdrawing from [[fandom]] and no longer attending comics conventions (at one [[UKCAC]] in [[London]] he is said to have been followed into the toilet by eager autograph hunters).  

''Marvelman'' was reprinted and continued for the American market as ''[[Miracleman]]'', published by independent publisher [[Eclipse Comics]]. The change of name was prompted by [[Marvel Comics]]' complaints of possible [[trademark]] infringement. Despite [[copyright]] disputes with artists and allegations of non-payment against the publisher, Moore, with artists [[Chuck Austen]], Rick Veitch and John Totleben, finished the story he wanted to tell and handed the character to writer [[Neil Gaiman]] and artist [[Mark Buckingham]] to continue. The legal ownership of the character continues to be rather murky.

Moore and Lloyd took ''V for Vendetta'' to DC, where it was reprinted and completed in full colour and released as a graphic novel. However Moore (along with [[Frank Miller]] and [[Howard Chaykin]]) fell out with DC over a proposed age-rating system similar to those used for films, and he stopped working for them after completing ''V for Vendetta'' in 1989.

====''Twilight of the Superheroes''====
There is a &quot;lost work&quot; from this period, a miniseries proposal called ''Twilight of the Superheroes'' which Moore submitted to DC at some point in 1987. A superheroic pun on [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera act, the &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot; ([[Götterdämmerung]]), this story was to be set two decades in the future of the [[DC Universe]] and would feature an epic final conflict between good and evil, as well as between the older and younger generations of superheroes. ''Twilight'' was conceived as a standalone [[limited series]] which could optionally also be tied into ongoing titles, much like the then-recent 12-issue limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. However, it would also undo one element of the prior series by restoring writers' access to the various multiple earths which had been eliminated during ''Crisis''. Cleverly, Moore did this in such a way as to leave the single timeline of the post-''Crisis'' continuity intact.

The story would feature a world ruled over by superheroic houses, in which the two most powerful, the House of Steel (presided over by [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]) and the House of Thunder (consisting of the [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Marvel]] family) are about to join forces through a political marriage between the children of the two families. Such a marriage would make the combined houses an unstoppable force and a potential danger to freedom, and as such certain characters set about a complex plot to prevent the marriage and free humanity from the power of the superheroes. By the climax of the story, elements from all across the universe and from up and down the timestream would be brought in. Unusually, the series would highlight many obscure and forgotten DC characters by putting them in important roles, and the lead character would be [[John Constantine]], whose interaction with the superheroes of the DC Universe had up until then (and indeed since) been rather minor.

With Moore's departure from DC, the series never got beyond the proposal stage, although copies of Moore's very lengthy notes have appeared on the internet and in print. DC have been quite thorough in tracking down and suppressing these copies as the story, though unpublished, is still considered the property of the company. Elements of ''Twilight'' can be seen in the concept of [[Hypertime (comics)|hypertime]] and particularly in DC's similar-themed series [[Kingdom Come (comic)|''Kingdom Come'']], leading cynics to remark that the suppression of copies of the ''Twilight'' proposal may be an attempt by DC to hide the fact that they are strip-mining unused Moore concepts. Both [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]], the creators of ''Kingdom Come'', have admitted that they had read the ''Twilight'' proposal before starting work on their series, but claim that any similarities are both minor and unintended.

===Independent period===
A variety of projects followed, including ''[[Brought to Light]]'', a history of [[CIA]] covert operations with illustrator [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] for [[Eclipse Comics]], and an anthology, ''[[AARGH (Artists Against Rampant Government Homophobia)]]'' campaigning against [[Section 28|anti-homosexual legislation]], which Moore published himself through his newly-formed publishing company, Mad Love.

After prompting by cartoonist and self-publishing advocate [[Dave Sim]], Moore then used Mad Love to publish his next project, ''[[Big Numbers]]'', a proposed 12-issue series set in contemporary Britain and based on [[chaos theory]] and the mathematical ideas of [[Benoît Mandelbrot]]. Bill Sienkiewicz illustrated in an intense, painted style but the workload became too much for him after only two issues. His assistant [[Al Columbia]] took over and painted a third issue, which never saw print, and the series was abandoned. Mad Love was financially wiped out.

Moore contributed two serials to the horror anthology ''Taboo'', edited by Stephen R. Bissette. ''[[From Hell]]'' examined the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders as a microcosm of the 1880s, and the 1880s as the root of the 20th Century. Illustrated in an appropriately sooty pen and ink style by [[Eddie Campbell]], ''From Hell'' took nearly ten years to complete, outlasting ''Taboo'' and going through two more publishers before being collected as a graphic novel by Eddie Campbell Comics. ''[[Lost Girls]]'', with artist [[Melinda Gebbie]] (who would eventually become Moore's second wife), is an [[erotic]] series decoding the sexual meanings in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Peter Pan]]'' and ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. A collected edition is due in early 2006.

He also wrote a graphic novel for [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]], ''[[A Small Killing]]'', illustrated by [[Oscar Zarate]], about a once idealistic advertising executive haunted by his boyhood self, published in 1988 through Mad Love and reprinted in 2003 by [[Avatar Press]].

===Return to the mainstream===
After several years out of the mainstream, Moore worked his way back into superhero comics by writing several series for [[Image Comics]] and the companies that later broke away from it. He felt that his influence on comics had in many ways been detrimental. Instead of taking inspiration from the more innovative aspects of his work, creators who followed him had merely imitated the violence and grimness.  As a reaction against the superhero genre's abandonment of its innocence, Moore and artists Stephen R. Bissette, Rick Veitch and John Totleben conceived ''[[1963 (comic)|1963]]'', a series of comics pastiching Marvel's early output.

Tapping into the early issues of ''[[Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', ''[[Iron Man]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', and the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', Moore wrote the comics according to the styles of the time, including the period's sexism and pro-capitalist propaganda, which, though played seriously, appeared quaint to a 90s audience. There was also a large streak of self-promotion, a satire of the bombastic Marvel editorial columns and policies of [[Stan Lee]].

The series was to have concluded with an annual in which the heroes travel to the 1990s to meet the prototypical grim, ultra-violent [[Image Comics]] characters.  The ''1963'' heroes would have been shocked at their descendants, even the change in art from four colors to gray shading would have been commented upon. The annual never appeared due to disputes within Image and the creative team. 

Following ''1963'', Moore worked on [[Jim Lee]]'s ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.T.s]]'' and a number of [[Rob Liefeld]]'s titles, including ''[[Supreme (comics)|Supreme]]'', ''[[Youngblood]]'' and ''[[Glory (comics)|Glory]]'', retooling sometimes rudimentary and derivative characters and settings into more viable series. In Moore's hands, ''Supreme'' became an inventive post-modern homage to superhero comics from the 1940s on, and the Superman comics of the [[Mort Weisinger]] era in particular.

===America's Best Comics===
[[Image:League.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover art for the collected edition of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' by [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]].]]

After working on Jim Lee's comic ''WildC.A.T.s'', Moore created the ABC ([[America's Best Comics]]) line, an entirely new group of characters to be published by Lee's company [[Wildstorm]]. Before publication, however, Lee sold Wildstorm to DC, and Moore found himself in the uncomfortable position of working for DC again. The line included:

*''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', a team-up book featuring characters from [[Victorian era]] [[pulp fiction]] such as [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s [[Allan Quatermain]], [[H. G. Wells]]' [[The Invisible Man|Invisible Man]], [[Jules Verne]]'s [[Captain Nemo]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s [[The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]], and Wilhelmina Murray from [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', drawn by [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]];
*''[[Tom Strong]]'', a post-modern superhero story drawing on and politicizing pre-Superman characters such as [[Doc Savage]] and [[Tarzan]] and subtly implicating their moral absolutism in a program of [[fascism]], drawn by [[Chris Sprouse]] and others;
*''[[Top 10 (comic)|Top 10]]'', a deadpan but hysterical [[police procedural]] set in a city where everyone, from the police and criminals to the civilians and even pets, has super-powers, costumes and secret identities, drawn by [[Gene Ha]] (finished art) and [[Zander Cannon]] (layouts). The series ended after twelve issues, but spawned two spin-offs: the miniseries ''[[Smax]]'', drawn by Cannon, and ''[[Top 10: The Forty-Niners]]'', a graphic novel drawn by Ha;
*''[[Promethea]]'', a superheroine explicitly from the realms of the imagination, which also explores Moore's ideas about [[consciousness]], [[mysticism]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[écriture féminine]] and the [[Kabbalah]], drawn by [[J.H. Williams III]];
*''[[Tomorrow Stories]]'', an anthology series with a regular cast of characters such as [[Cobweb (comics)|Cobweb]], [[First American]], [[Greyshirt]], [[Jack B. Quick]], and [[Splash Brannigan]].

===Disputes with DC and Marvel Comics===
As noted above, Moore had a long-standing dispute with DC Comics, and he was unhappy that his deal with Wildstorm unexpectedly placed him in the DC &quot;family.&quot; Wildstorm attempted to placate him by forming an editorial &quot;firewall&quot; to insulate Moore from DC's corporate offices. However, various incidents continued to irritate Moore. ''League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' #5 contained an authentic vintage advertisement for a &quot;[[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]&quot;-brand [[douche]], which caused DC executive [[Paul Levitz]] to order the entire print run destroyed and reprinted without the advertisement.

In 2002, [[Marvel Comics]]' editor-in-chief, [[Joe Quesada]], attempted to persuade Moore to contribute new work (Moore had already contributed to Marvel's [[9/11]] tribute comic, ''Heroes''). Quesada had spent a lot of time courting contributors who had previously had problems with the company. Moore was suitably impressed by Quesada's claim that the company he had once known had now changed, and that the problems (Marvel US had printed some of Moore's [[Marvel UK]] ''Doctor Who Weekly'' strips without his permission) he'd had previously would not happen again.

This resulted in Moore's approving a trade paperback collection of his ''Captain Britain'' work with Alan Davis, on the understanding that he would receive full credit for his characters. Unfortunately, Moore's credit was omitted due to a printing error, and this led him to declare that he would no longer consider working for Marvel, despite Quesada having apologised publicly and ensured that later editions were corrected.

===Reactions to film adaptations===
Film adaptations of Moore's work also proved controversial. With ''[[From Hell]]'' and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', Moore was content to allow the filmmakers to do whatever they wished and removed himself from the process entirely. &quot;As long as I could distance myself by not seeing them,&quot; he said, he could profit from the films while leaving the original comics untouched, &quot;assured no one would confuse the two. This was probably naïve on my part.&quot;{{ref|gutters}}

Trouble arose when producer Martin Poll and screenwriter Larry Cohen filed a [[lawsuit]] against [[20th Century Fox]], alleging that the film ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' plagiarized their script entitled ''Cast of Characters.'' Although the two scripts bear many similarities, most of them are elements that were added for the film and do not originate in Moore's comics. According to Moore, &quot;they seemed to believe that the head of 20th Century Fox called me up and persuaded me to steal this screenplay, turning it into a comic book which they could then adapt back into a movie, to camouflage petty larceny.&quot; Moore testified in court hearings, a process so painful that he surmised he would have been better treated having &quot;sodomised and murdered a busload of children after giving them heroin.&quot; Fox's settlement of the case insulted Moore, who interpreted it as an admission of guilt.

Moore's reaction was to divorce himself from the film world: he would refuse to allow film adaptations of anything to which he owned full copyright. In cases where others owned the rights, he would withdraw his name from the credits and refuse to accept payment, instead requesting that the money go to his collaborators (i.e. the artists). This was the arrangement used for the film ''[[Constantine (movie)|Constantine]]''.

The last straw came when producer [[Joel Silver]] misquoted Moore at a press conference for the upcoming ''V for Vendetta'' film, produced by [[Warner Brothers]] (which also owns DC Comics). Silver stated that producer [[Wachowski brothers|Larry Wachowski]] had talked with Moore, and that &quot;he [Moore] was very excited about what Larry had to say.&quot;{{ref|vpress}} Moore, who claims that he told Wachowski &quot;I didn't want anything to do with films... I wasn't interested in Hollywood,&quot; demanded that DC and Warner Brothers issue a retraction and apology for Silver's &quot;blatant lies.&quot; No retraction or apology appeared, and in response Moore announced his departure from Wildstorm/DC/Warner Bros. ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Dark Dossier,'' a hardcover graphic novel, will be his last work for the publisher. Future installments of ''LoEG'' will be published by [[Top Shelf Productions]] and [[Knockabout Comics]]. Moore has also stated that he wishes his name to be &quot;[[Alan Smithee]]d&quot; from comic work that he does not own.{{ref|smithee}}

===Current work===
Moore currently has several titles being produced under the auspices of his own line of comics, America's Best.  Comics under this banner have included the Eisner-Award winning Top 10 as well as The League of Extraordinary gentlemen, Tom Strong, Supreme, Promothea and Tomorrow Stories.

===Awards and recognition===
His work has won him several awards, including a 1985 [[Jack Kirby Award]] for Best Single Issue for ''Swamp Thing Annual'' #2 with John Totleben and Steve Bissette, the 1985, 1986 and 1987 Jack Kirby Awards for Best Continuing Series for ''Swamp Thing'' with Totleben and Bissette, the 1985 and 1986 Jack Kirby Awards for Best Writer for Swamp Thing, the 1987 Jack Kirby Award for Best Writer for ''Watchmen'', the 1987 Jack Kirby Finite Series (completed in 1986) Award for ''Watchmen'' with Dave Gibbons, the 1987 Jack Kirby award for Best Writer/Artist (Single or Team) for ''Watchmen'' with Gibbons, the Comics' Buyer's Guide Award for Favorite Writer in 1996, 2000, and 2001.

He received the [[Harvey Award]] for Best Writer for 1988 (for Watchmen), for 1995 and 1996 (for ''From Hell''), for 1999 (for his body of work, including ''From Hell'' and ''Supreme''), for 2000 (for ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen''), and for 2001 and 2003 (for ''Promethea'').

In addition, he received nominations for the 1985 Jack Kirby Award for Best Single Issue for ''Swamp Thing'' #32 with [[Shawn McManus]], the 1985 Jack Kirby Award for Best Single issue for ''Swamp Thing'' #34 with John Totleben and Steve Bissette, a 1986 Jack Kirby nomination for Best Single Issue for ''Superman Annual'' #9 with Dave Gibbons, a 1986 Jack Kirby nomination for Best Single Issue for ''Swamp Thing'' #43 with [[Stan Woch]], a 1986 Jack Kirby nomination for Best Writer/Artist (single or team) for ''Swamp Thing'' with Bissette, 1987 Jack Kirby Award nominations for Best Single Issue for both ''Watchmen'' #1 and #2 with Dave Gibbons, and the [[Comics' Buyer's Guide]] Award for Favorite Writer in 1997, 1998, and 1999.

==Major works==
===Marvelman/Miracleman===
{{main|Miracleman}}

[[Image:Miracle3.png|thumb|left|140px|Cover art for ''[[Miracleman]]''#3 by [[Howard Chaykin]].]]

Starting in 1982 within the pages of ''Warrior'', Alan Moore resurrected ''Marvelman'', a popular British comic from the 1950s which was a thinly disguised ripoff of the American superhero [[Captain Marvel]].  The strip, which ran from 1954 to 1963, followed the adventures of Micky Moran, a young boy who was given the power to become a full grown superhero by a recluse astro-scientist who discovered the secret &quot;key harmonic&quot; of the universe. The strip, which maintained a childish innocence and purity, has the distinction of being the first British superhero comic. The new version would [[retcon]] and revise utterly the earlier children's comic.  After ''Warrior'' closed, ''Marvelman'' was reprinted and continued at [[Eclipse Comics]], renamed &quot;Miracleman&quot; due to a trademark dispute with Marvel Comics.

''Miracleman'' is an early example of [[post-modernism]] in superhero comics, and has a strong theme of loss of innocence. Another key idea is that the existence of a superhero would change the world radically, something Moore would return to in ''Watchmen''.

===V for Vendetta===
{{main|V for Vendetta}}
Moore's original strip for the British Warrior comic was designed as an homage to the spirit of the British Boys Adventure comics of the 1950s and 60s as well as referencing literary sources such as [[George Orwell]] and the libertarianism of [[William Blake]]. The title character &quot;V&quot; appears at first to be a modern [[Robin Hood]] figure righting wrongs in a corrupt [[fascist]] Britain of the future, but as the story develops becomes more complex, a trickster version of a [[Bakunin]]esque revolutionary. It becomes clear that V differs from standard comic heroes in that his purpose is to empower &quot;ordinary&quot; people rather than do things for them. In bringing down the government, his intention is not to replace it with another of his choosing but to clear the stage for people to rule themselves. Moore's writing in 'V' continually challenges the legitimacy of those who would wield power over others: the party members are shown to be morally and politically corrupt.

Though set in the year 1997, the strip captures the feel of life in Britain in the early 1980s, with [[Thatcherism|economic decline and a perpetual drift to the right]] in national politics. It was among the first comics to use the literary device of [[intertextuality]], with V's speech often made up of extended quotes and references that are not cited. 'Vendetta' marks Moore's first use of the technique that has become his motif: using secondary characters to carry forward plot development or elicit background details. 'V' remains a shadowy figure who never removes his [[Guy Fawkes]] mask.

::&quot;Dave [Gibbons] was giving me his ideas as to how he actually wanted to approach the strip in terms of layout and execution. These included the absolute banning of sound effects, and as an afterthought, the utter eradication of thought balloons into the bargain.&quot; -- Moore, &quot;Behind the Painted Smile&quot;, &lt;i&gt;Warrior Magazine&lt;/i&gt; #17, 1983.

===Swamp Thing===
{{main|Swamp Thing}}

[[Image:Swampthingmoore21.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover of ''[[Swamp Thing]]''#21, &quot;The Anatomy Lesson&quot;; art by [[Tom Yeates]].]]

Moore's first American work was ''Swamp Thing'', a title starring a man turned into a vegetable monster by an experimental plant growth formula, which at the time was one of DC's poorest selling titles. The editor, Len Wein, had been a huge fan of Moore's work in ''Warrior'' and had decided to hire Moore to take over the book from [[Martin Pasko]]. Moore's first issue wrapped up Pasko's storyline and set up what would be his own unique take on a former fan-favourite character.

In Moore's second issue, &quot;The Anatomy Lesson&quot;, the title character is shot and dissected by scientist Jason Woodrue.  Woodrue, who was also the villain [[Floronic Man]], soon concludes that Swamp Thing is a superficial imitation of a man, his lungs cannot pump air, his brain does not contain neurons.  He concludes that the swamp creature is a plant which had absorbed the memories and imitated the life of a dead man; Swamp Thing was never human. The initial shock to his sense of identity led the character to embrace his identity as a plant, discovering new abilities and becoming less a &quot;muck-encrusted mockery of a man&quot; than a virtual vegetation [[deity]].

Many of Moore's stories dealt with social ills as seen through horror metaphors.  Sexual discrimination, racism, violence, fear of nuclear energy, and pollution are all themes addressed in his work. The series was formally ambitious, using unusual story structures and experimenting with different ways to combine text and image for narrative effect. The slow, languorous pace of Steve Bissette's layouts, the intricate textures of John Totleben's inks, and [[Tatjana Wood]]'s imaginative and atmospheric use of colour were all put to good use.

The series also revitalised DC's neglected magical and supernatural characters, featuring the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], the [[The Demon (comics)|Demon]], the [[Phantom Stranger]], [[Deadman]] and others in supporting roles. At the prompting of Bissette and Totleben, who were fans of [[The Police]] and wanted to draw a character who looked like [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] (specifically his character from the film [[Brimstone and Treacle]]), Moore created his own magical character, [[Hellblazer|John Constantine]], who would go on to headline a title of his own, ''Hellblazer'', that is the longest continuously published comic of DC's [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint.

Moore's ''Swamp Thing'' was enormously influential in showing a larger audience that genre comics could address serious issues and take on literary pretensions. DC followed ''Swamp Thing'''s success by recruiting British writers like [[Grant Morrison]], [[Jamie Delano]], [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Neil Gaiman]] to write comics in a similar vein, often involving radical revamps of obscure characters, and thus laid the foundation of what became the Vertigo line.

Gaiman in particular was strongly influenced by Moore's ''Swamp Thing'' work: his ''[[Black Orchid]]'', ''[[Books of Magic]]'' and many early ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Sandman]]'' stories are largely derived from Moore's innovations.
