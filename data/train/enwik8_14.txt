: 0 km² (1993)
; Natural hazards:
: [[katabatic wind|Katabatic]] (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau; cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise along the coast; volcanism on [[Deception Island]] and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak
; Environment - current issues:
: [[Ozone hole]], [[sea level rise]]
; Geography - note:
: The coldest, windiest, highest (2,300 m on average), and driest continent; during summer, more solar radiation reaches the surface at the [[South Pole]] than is received at the [[Equator]] in an equivalent period; mostly uninhabitable.

==Volcanoes==
There are four [[volcano]]es on the mainland of Antarctica that are
considered to be active on the basis of observed fumarolic activity or
&quot;recent&quot; tephra deposits: 
[[Mount Melbourne]] (2,730 m) (74°21'S., 164°42'E.), a stratovolcano; 
[[Mount Berlin]] (3,500 m) (76°03'S., 135°52'W.), a stratovolcano; 
Mount Kauffman (2,365 m) (75°37'S., 132°25'W.), a stratovolcano; and 
[[Mount Hampton]] (3,325 m) (76°29'S., 125°48'W.), a volcanic caldera.
 
Several volcanoes on offshore islands have records of historic activity.
[[Mount Erebus]] (3,795m), a stratovolcano on
[[Ross Island]] with 10 known eruptions and 1 suspected eruption.
On the opposite side of the continent, 
[[Deception Island]]
(62°57'S., 60°38'W.), a volcanic caldera with 10 known
and 4 suspected eruptions, have been the most active.
[[Buckle Island]] in the [[Balleny Islands]] (66°50'S., 163°12'E.), 
[[Penguin Island (South Shetland Islands)|Penguin Island]] (62°06'S., 57°54'W.), 
Paulet Island (63°35'S., 55°47'W.), and 
Lindenberg Island (64°55'S., 59°40'W.) are also 
considered to be active.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[Antarctica]]''' has no indigenous inhabitants, but there are seasonally staffed research stations.  Approximately 29 nations, all signatory to the [[Antarctic Treaty]], send personnel to perform seasonal (summer) and year-round research on the continent and in its surrounding oceans; the population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent and its nearby islands south of 60 degrees south latitude (the region covered by the Antarctic Treaty) varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter; in addition, approximately 1,000 personnel including ship's crew and scientists doing onboard research are present in the waters of the treaty region.

At least three children have been born in Antarctica. The first was [[Emilio Marcos Palma]], born [[January 7]], [[1978]] to [[Argentina|Argentine]] parents on the Argentine Base [[Esperanza Base|Esperanza]], near the tip of the Antarctic peninsula. In [[1986]], [[Juan Pablo Camacho]] was born at the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base, becoming the first [[Chile]]an born in Antarctica. Soon after a girl, Gisella, was born at the same station.

      <text xml:space="preserve">No [[economics|economic]] activity is conducted at present in [[Antarctica]], except for [[fishing]] off the coast and small-scale [[tourism]], both based abroad. Antarctic fisheries in [[1998]]-[[1999]] ([[July 1]]- [[June 30]]) reported landing 119,898 metric tons. Unregulated [[fishing]] landed five to six times more than the regulated fishery, and allegedly illegal fishing in antarctic waters in [[1998]] resulted in the seizure (by [[France]] and [[Australia]]) of at least eight fishing ships. A total of 10,013 tourists visited in the [[1998]]-[[1999]] summer, up from the 9,604 who visited the previous year. Nearly all of them were passengers on 16 commercial (nongovernmental) ships and several [[yacht]]s that made 116 trips during the summer. Most tourist trips lasted approximately two weeks.

Small-scale tourism has existed since 1957. Since 1969, over 30,000 tourists have been to Antarctica.[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm] As of 2006, several ships transport people to Antarctica to visit specific scenic locations. Sight-seeing flights also used to take people from Australia and New Zealand over Antarctica and back again, until the fatal crash of [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] near [[Mount Erebus]] late in 1979.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Transportation in Antarctica''' is usually done over sea or plane, and requires special measures against the cold.

==Ports and harbors==
[[Antarctica]]'s only harbour is at [[McMurdo Station]]. Most coastal stations have offshore anchorages, and supplies are transferred from ship to shore by small boats, barges, and helicopters. A few stations have a basic wharf facility. All ships at port are subject to inspection in accordance with Article 7, [[Antarctic Treaty]]; offshore anchorage is sparse and intermittent.
[[McMurdo Station]] ({{coor dm|77|51|S|166|40|E|}}), [[Palmer Station]] ({{coor dm|64|43|S|64|03|W|}}); government use only except by permit (see Permit Office under &quot;Legal System&quot;).

==Airports==
Antarctica has 20 airports, but there are no developed public-access airports or landing facilities. 30 stations, operated by 16 national governments party to the [[Antarctic Treaty]], have landing facilities for either [[helicopter]]s and/or fixed-wing [[aircraft]]; commercial enterprises operate two additional air facilities.

Helicopter pads are available at 27 stations; runways at 15 locations are gravel, sea-ice, blue-ice, or compacted snow suitable for landing wheeled, fixed-wing aircraft; of these, 1 is greater than 3 km in length, 6 are between 2 km and 3 km in length, 3 are between 1 km and 2 km in length, 3 are less than 1 km in length, and 2 are of unknown length; snow surface skiways, limited to use by [[ski]]-equipped, fixed-wing aircraft, are available at another 15 locations; of these, 4 are greater than 3 km in length, 3 are between 2 km and 3 km in length, 2 are between 1 km and 2 km in length, 2 are less than 1 km in length, and data is unavailable for the remaining 4. 

Antarctic airports are subject to severe restrictions and limitations resulting from extreme seasonal and geographic conditions; they do not meet [[ICAO]] standards, and advance approval from the respective governmental or nongovernmental operating organization is required for landing (1999 est.)

==Physical Features==
The surface of [[Alabama]] in the N. and N.E., embracing about two-fifths of its area, is diversified and picturesque; the remaining portion is occupied by a gently undulating plain having a general incline south-westward toward the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

Extending entirely across the state of Alabama for about 20 m.  S. of its N. boundary, and in the middle stretching 60 m. farther S., is the ''Cumberland Plateau'', or ''Tennessee Valley'' region, broken into broad table-lands by the dissection of rivers.  In the N. part of this plateau, W. of [[Jackson County, Alabama|Jackson county]], there are about 1000 sq. m. of level highlands from 700 to 800 ft. above the sea.  South of these highlands, occupying a narrow strip on each side of the [[Tennessee River]], is a country of gentle rolling lowlands varying in elevation from 500 to 800 ft.  To the N.E. of these highlands and lowlands is a rugged section with steep mountain-sides, deep narrow coves and valleys, and flat mountain-tops.  Its elevations range from 400 to 1800 ft.  In the remainder of this region, the S. portion, the most prominent feature is Little Mountain, extending about 80 m. from E. to W. between two valleys, and Asing precipitouslyon the N. side 500 ft. above them or 1000ft. above the sea.

Adjoining the Cumberland Plateau region on the S.E. is the ''Appalachian Valley'' (locally known as Coosa Valley) region, which is the S. extremity of the great [[Appalachian Mountains]], and occupies an area within the state of about 8000 sq. m.  This is a [[limestone]] belt with parallel hard rock ridges left standing by erosion to form mountains.  Although the general direction of the mountains, ridges and valleys is N.E. and S.W., irregularity is one of the most prominent characteristics.  In the N.E. are several flat-topped mountains, of which Raccoon and [[Lookout Mountain|Lookout]] are the most prominent, having a maximum elevation near the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] line of little more than 1800 ft. and gradually decreasing in height toward the S.W., where Sand Mountain is a continuation of Raccoon.  South of these the mountains are marked by steep N.W. sides, sharp crests and gently sloping S.E. sides.

South-east of the Appalachian Valley region, the ''Piedmont Plateau'' also crosses the Alabama border from the N.E. and occupies a small triangular-shaped section of which [[Randolph County, Alabama|Randolph]] and [[Clay County, Alabama|Clay]] counties, together with the N. part of [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] and [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], form the principal portion.  Its surface is gently undulating and has an elevation of about 1000 ft. above the sea.  The Piedmont Plateau is a lowland worn down by erosion on hard crystalline rocks, then uplifted to form a plateau.

The remainder of the state is occupied by the ''Coastal Plain''.  This is crossed by foot-hills and rolling prairies in the central part of the state, where it has a mean elevation of about 600 ft., becomes lower and more level toward the S.W., and in the extreme S. is flat and but slightly elevated above the sea.

The Cumberland Plateau region is drained to the W.N.W. by the [[Tennessee River]] and its tributaries; all other parts of the state are drained to the S.W. In the Appalachian Valley region the Coosa is the principal river; and in the Piedmont Plateau, the Tallapoosa.  In the Coastal Plain are the Tombigbee in the W., the Alabama (formed by the Coosa and Tallapoosa) in the W. central, and in the E. the Chattahoochee, which forms almost half of the Georgia boundary.  The [[Tombigbee River|Tombigbee]] and [[Alabama River|Alabama]] unite near the S.W. corner of the state, their waters discharging into [[Mobile Bay]] by the [[Mobile River|Mobile]] and Tensas rivers.  The Black Warrior is a considerable stream which joins the Tombigbee from the E.

The valleys in the N. and N.E. are usually deep and narrow, but in the Coastal Plain they are broad and in most cases rise in three successive terraces above the stream.  The harbour of Mobile was formed by the drowning of the lower part of the valley of the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers as a result of the sinking of the land here, such sinking having occurred on other parts of the Gulf coast. 

The fauna and flora of Alabama are similar to those of the Gulf states in general and have no distinctive characteristics.

==Climate and Soil==
The [[climate]] of Alabama is temperate and fairly uniform.

The heat of summer is tempered in the south by the winds from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and in the north by the elevation above the sea. The average annual temperature is highest in the southwest along the coast (where the climate is [[subtropical]]), and lowest in the northeast among the highlands. Thus at Mobile the annual mean is 67°F (19°C), the mean for the summer 81°F (27°C), and for the winter 52°F (11°C); and at Valley Head, in De Kalb county, the annual mean is 59°F (15°C), the mean for the summer 75°F (24°C), and for the winter 41°F (5°C). At Montgomery, in the central region, the average annual temperature is 66°F (19°C), with a winter average of 49°F (9°C), and a summer average of 81°F (27°C).  The average winter minimum for the entire state is 35°F (2°C), and there is an average of 35 days in each year in which the thermometer falls below the freezing-point.  At extremely rare intervals the thermometer has fallen below zero (-18°F), as was the case in the remarkable cold wave of the 12th-13th of February [[1899]], when an absolute minimum of -17°F (-29°C) was registered at [[Valley Head, Alabama|Valley Head]]. The highest temperature ever recorded was 109°F (43°C) in [[Talladega County, Alabama|Talladega]] county in [[1902]].

The amount of precipitation is greatest along the coast (62 inches/1,574 mm) and evenly distributed through the rest of the state (about 52 inches/1,320 mm). During each winter there is usually one fall of snow in the south and two in the north; but the snow quickly disappears, and sometimes, during an entire winter, the ground is not covered with snow. [[Hailstorm]]s occur occasionally in the spring and summer, but are seldom destructive. Heavy [[fog]]s are rare, and are confined chiefly to the coast. [[Thunderstorm]]s occur throughout the year, but are most common in the summer. The prevailing winds are from the south. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricane]]s are quite common in the state, especially in the southern part, and major hurricanes occasionally strike the coast which can be very destructive.

As regards its soil, Alabama may be divided into four regions.  Extending from the Gulf northward for about 150 miles (240 km) is the outer belt of the Coastal Plain, also called the ''Timber Belt,'' whose soil is sandy and poor, but responds well to fertilization.  North of this is the inner lowland of the Coastal Plain, or the ''Black Prairie,'' which includes some 13,000 square miles and seventeen counties.  It receives its name from its soil (weathered from the weak underlying limestone), which is black in colour, almost destitute of sand and loam, and rich in limestone and marl formations, especially adapted to the production of cotton; hence the region is also called the ''Cotton Belt.'' Between the ''Cotton Belt'' and the [[Tennessee Valley]] is the [[mineral]] region, the ''Old Land'' area -- a region of resistant rocks -- whose soils, also derived from weathering in silu, are of varied fertility, the best coming from the granites, sandstones and limestones, the poorest from the gneisses, schists and slates.  North of the mineral region is the ''Cereal Belt,'' embracing the Tennessee Valley and the counties beyond, whose richest soils are the red clays and dark loams of the river valley; north of which are less fertile soils, produced by siliceous and sandstone formations.

==Public lands==
Alabama includes several types of public use lands:

* [[List of Alabama state parks|Alabama State Parks]]

Alabama has four national forests and one national preserve within its borders. They provide over 25% of the state's public recreation land.  There is a national seashore that runs along the gulf coast, encompassing several islands and beachfront areas.

'''Apocrypha''' is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word (απόκρυφα, neuter plural of απόκρυφος), from αποκρυπτειν, to hide away. Thus it connotes the idea of &quot;closed&quot; or &quot;hidden.&quot; (In this sense apocrypha is in contrast with [[apocalypse]], which means &quot;opened,&quot; &quot;revealed,&quot; or &quot;uncovered.&quot;) '''Apocryphon''' is the singular noun, '''apocrypha''' the plural noun, and '''apocryphal''' the adjective. These words are used to describe the character of a certain class of religiously oriented ancient writings. 

By an analogy the term is extended to non-religious contexts to refer to questionable sources.

==Non-religious usage==
&lt;!-- I placed this small section on top, since the whole rest is religious subject --&gt;
In everyday conversation, '''''apocryphal''''' typically denotes &quot;of highly questionable or no authenticity&quot;, when describing a story nevertheless frequently told and widely believed. In [[literature]], '''''apocrypha''''' are works that purport to have been created by somebody other than their real author, usually a famous figure, as in the case of the [[Ossian|Ossianic]] cycle invented by [[James Macpherson]].

==Religious usage==
In [[Judeo-Christian]] [[theology]], the word '''apocrypha''' refers to texts that are not considered [[Biblical canon|canonical]], part of [[Scripture|the Bible]], but are of roughly similar style and age as the accepted canonical Scriptures. [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] Bibles typically contain several texts not included in the Biblical canon by other Christians or by Judaism, who see them as apocryphal. Catholics and Orthodox consider these texts equally canonical as other books of the Bible, with Catholics terming them ''[[deuterocanon]]ical'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: &quot;second canon,&quot; or &quot;measuring rule&quot;).

R.M. Wilson wrote:
:&quot;The Greek word ''apocryphos'' did not always have the disparaging sense which later became attached to it. In [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] circles it was used of books the contents of which were too sacred to be divulged to the common herd, and it was in fact the [[heresy|heretical]] associations which it thus came to possess which led to its use as a term of disparagement. In the [[Nag Hammadi library]], for example, one document bears the title Apocryphon or Secret Book of John, another that of Apocryphon of James, and several Gnostic gospels contain solemn warnings against imparting their contents to any save the deserving, or for the sake of material gain.&quot;
:&amp;mdash;from ''Studies in the Gospel of Thomas'' (the &quot;apocryphal&quot; [[Gospel of Thomas]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Apart from the broad sense mentioned in the first paragraph above, Protestants use the word &quot;apocrypha&quot;, in a narrow sense, of those books that they exclude from their canon of Scripture, but that other Churches view as canonical and venerate as divinely inspired, written under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Disagreement between Christian Churches is almost non-existent about the canon of the [[New Testament]], but the inclusion of some books in the [[Old Testament]] canon is disputed. Since many now considered these books to be of late composition, Protestant scholars sometimes call them &quot;intertestamental&quot;, i.e. intermediate between the Old and New Testaments, and hold that God imposed a period of silence, with no prophecy or Scripture, to prepare for the coming of [[Jesus]].

The [[Church of England]] takes an intermediate position; its 6th article of religion says of them &quot;the Church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine&quot;.

The books that come under the description &quot;apocrypha&quot; in the broad sense but not in this narrow sense are called apocrypha by Catholics and Jews, but Protestants usually call them [[Pseudepigrapha]]. Many of them have [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] themes.

The history of the earlier usage of the term &quot;Apocrypha&quot; is not free from obscurity. We shall therefore enter at once on a short account of the origin of this literature in [[Judaism]], of its adoption by early [[Christianity]], of the various meanings which the term &quot;apocryphal&quot; assumed in the course of its history, and having so done we shall proceed to classify and deal with the books that belong to this literature. The word most generally denotes writings which claimed to be, or were by certain sects regarded as, sacred scriptures although excluded from the canonical scriptures. 

===Apocrypha in Judaism===
Certain circles in Judaism, as the [[Essenes]] in Palestine (Josephus, ''B.J.'' ii. 8. 7) and the [[Therapeutae]] (Philo, ''De Vita Contempl.'' ii. 475, ed. Mangey) in Egypt possessed a secret literature. But such literature was not confined to the members of these communities, but had been current among the [[Chasids]] and their successors the [[Pharisees]]. (Judaism was long accustomed to lay claim to an esoteric tradition. Thus though it insisted on the exclusive canonicity of the 24 books, it claimed the possession of an [[oral law]] handed down from [[Moses]], and just as the apocryphal books overshadowed in certain instances the canonical scriptures, so often the oral law displaced the written in the regard of Judaism.) To this literature belong essentially the [[apocalyptic literature|apocalypses]] which were published in fast succession from [[Daniel]] onwards. These works bore, perforce, the names of ancient Hebrew worthies in order to procure them a hearing among the writers' real contemporaries. To reconcile their late appearance with their claims to primitive antiquity the alleged author is represented as &quot;shutting up and sealing&quot; (Dan. xii. 4, 9) the book, until the time of its fulfilment had arrived; for that it was not designed for his own generation but for far-distant ages (Ass. Mos. i. 16, 17). It is not improbable that with many Jewish enthusiasts this literature was more highly treasured than the canonical scriptures. Indeed, we have a categorical statement to this effect in 4 Ezra xiv. 44 sqq., which tells how Ezra was inspired to dictate the sacred scriptures which had been destroyed in the overthrow of Jerusalem: &quot;In forty days they wrote ninety-four books: and it came to pass when the forty days were fulfilled that the Highest spake, saying: the first that thou hast written publish openly that the worthy and unworthy may read it; but keep the seventy last that thou mayst deliver them only to such as be wise among the people; for in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of wisdom and the stream of knowledge.&quot; Such esoteric books are apocryphal in the original conception of the term. In due course the Jewish authorities drew up a canon or book of sacred scriptures in response to Christianity; they marked other books off from those which claimed to be such without justification.  

The true scriptures, according to the Jewish canon (Yad. iii. 5; Toseph. Yad. ii. 3), were those which defiled the hands of such as touched them. But other scholars, such as Zahn, Schürer, Porter, state that the secret books with which we have been dealing formed a class by themselves and were called &quot;Genuzim&quot; (גנוזים), and that this name and idea passed from Judaism over into the Greek, and that αποκρυφα βιβλια is a translation of ספרים גנוזים. But the Hebrew verb does not mean &quot;to hide&quot; but &quot;to store away,&quot; and is only used of things in themselves precious. Moreover, the phrase is unknown in Talmudic literature. The derivation of this idea from Judaism has therefore not yet been established. Whether the Jews had any distinct name for these esoteric works we do not know. For writings that stood wholly without the pale of sacred books such as the books of heretics or Samaritans they used the designation Hisonim, Sanh. x. I (ספרים חצונים and ספרי המינים. To this class in later times even Sirach was relegated, and indeed all books not included in the canon (Midr. r. Num. 14 and on Koheleth xii. 12; cf. Jer. Sabb. 16). (See Porter in Hastings' ''Bible Dict.'' i. 113) In Aqiba's time Sirach and other apocryphal books were not reckoned among the Hisonim; for Sirach was largely quoted by rabbis in Palestine till the 3rd century A.D.

===Apocrypha in Christianity===
Christianity from [[Jesus]] had no secret or [[esoteric]] teaching. It was essentially the revelation or manifestation of the truth of God. But as Christianity took its origin from Judaism, it is not unnatural that a large body of Jewish ideas was incorporated in the system of Christian thought. The bulk of these in due course underwent transformation either complete or partial, but there was always a residuum of incongruous and inconsistent elements existing side by side with the essential truths of Christianity. This was no isolated phenomenon; for in every progressive period of the history of religion we have on the one side the doctrine of God advancing in depth and fullness: on the other we have [[cosmology|cosmological]], [[eschatology|eschatological]] and other survivals, which, however justifiable in earlier stages, are in unmistakable antagonism with the theistic beliefs of the time. The eschatology of a nation--and the most influential portion of Jewish and Christian apocrypha are eschatological--is always the last part of their religion to experience the transforming power of new ideas and new facts.  

The contemporary religious literature of Judaism outside the canon was composed of apocryphal books, the bulk of which bore an apocalyptic character, and dealt with the coming of the Messianic kingdom. These naturally became the popular religious books of the rising Jewish-Christian communities, and were held by them in still higher esteem, if possible, than by the Jews. Occasionally these Jewish writings were re-edited or adapted to their new readers by Christian additions, but on the whole it was found sufficient to submit them to a system of reinterpretation in order to make them testify to the truth of Christianity and foreshadow its ultimate destinies. Christianity, moreover, moved by the same apocalyptic tendency as Judaism, gave birth to new Christian apocryphs, though, in the case of most of them, the subject matter was to a large extent traditional and derived from Jewish sources. 

Another prolific source of apocryphal gospels, acts and apocalypses was Gnosticism. While the characteristic features of apocalyptic literature were derived from Judaism, those of Gnosticism sprang partly from Greek philosophy, partly from oriental religions. They insisted on an allegorical interpretation of the apostolic writings: they alleged themselves to be the guardians of a secret apostolic tradition and laid claim to prophetic inspiration. With them, as with the bulk of the Christians of the 1st and 2nd centuries, apocryphal books as such were highly esteemed. They were so designated by those who valued them. It was not till later times that the term became one of reproach. 

We have remarked above that the Jewish apocrypha--especially the apocalyptic section and the host of Christian apocryphs--became the ordinary religious literature of the early Christians. And this is not strange seeing that of the former such abundant use was made by the writers of the New Testament. (The New Testament shows undoubtedly an acquaintance with several of the apocryphal books. Thus James i. 19 shows dependence on Sirach v. II, Hebrews i. 3 on Wisdom vii. 26, Hebrews xi. 35 on II Maccabees vi., Romans ix. 21 on Wisdom xv. 7, 2 Cor. v. 1, 4 on Wisdom ix. 15, &amp;c.) Thus [[Book of Jude|Jude]] quotes the [[Book of Enoch]] by name, while undoubted use of this book appears in the four gospels and 1 Peter. The influence of the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]] is still more apparent in the Pauline Epistles and the Gospels, and the same holds true of Jubilees and the Assumption of Moses, though in a very slight degree. The genuineness and inspiration of Enoch were believed in by the writer of the Ep. of Barnabas, [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]], and much of the early church. But the high position which apocryphal books occupied in the first two centuries was undermined by a variety of influences. All claims to the possession of a secret tradition were denied (Irenaeus ii. 27. 2, iii. 2. 1, 3. 1; Tertullian, ''Praescript.'' 22-27): true inspiration was limited to the apostolic age, and universal acceptance by the church was required as a proof of apostolic authorship. Under the action of such principles apocryphal books tended to pass into the class of spurious and heretical writings.

==== Esoteric writings ====
Turning now to the consideration of the word &quot;apocryphal&quot; itself, we find that in its earliest use it was applied in a laudatory sense to writings,which were kept secret because they were the vehicles of esoteric knowledge which was too profound or too sacred to be imparted to any save the initiated. Thus it occurs in a magical book of Moses, which has been edited from a Leiden papyrus of the 3rd or 4th century by Dieterich (Abraxas, 109). This book, which may be as old as the 1st century, is entitled: &quot;A holy and secret Book of Moses, called eighth, or holy&quot; (Μωυσεως ἱερα βιβλος αποκρυφος επικαλουμενη  ογδοη ἡ ἁγια). The disciples of the Gnostic Prodicus boasted (Clem. Alex. ''Strom.'' i. 15. 69) that they possessed the
secret (αποκρυφους) books of Zoroaster. 4 Ezra is in its author's view a secret work whose value was greater than that of the canonical scriptures (xiv. 44 sqq.) because of its transcendent revelations of the future. It is in a like laudatory meaning that Gregory reckons the New Testament apocalypse as εν αποκρυφοις (''Oratio in suam ordinationem'', iii. 549, ed. Migne; cf. Epiphanius, ''Haer.'' li. 3). The word enjoyed high consideration among the Gnostics (cf. Acts of Thomas, 10, 27, 44).

==== Questionable writings ====
But the word was applied to writings that were kept from public circulation not because of their transcendent, but of, their secondary or questionable value. Thus Origen distinguishes between writings which were read by the churches and apocryphal writings; γραφη μη φερομενη με&amp;nu εν τοις κοινοις και δεδημοσιευμενοις βιβλιοις εικος δ ὁτι εν αποκρυφοις φερομενη (Origen's ''Comm. in Matt.'', x. 18, on Matt. xiii. 57, ed. Lommatzsch iii. 49 sqq.). Cf. ''Epist. ad Africam'', ix. (Lommatzsch xvii. 31): Euseb. ''H.E.'' ii. 23, 25; iii. 3, 6. See Zahn, ''Gesch. Kanons'', i. 126 sqq. Thus the
meaning of αποκρυφος is here practically equivalent to &quot;excluded from the public use of the church,&quot; and prepares the way for the third and unfavourable sense of this word.

==== Spurious writings ====
The word came finally to mean what is false, spurious, bad, heretical. If we may trust the text, this meaning appears in Origen (''Prolog, in Cant. Cantic.'', Lommatzsch xiv. 325): &quot;De scripturis his, quae appellantur apocryphae, pro eo quod multa in iis corrupta et contra fidem veram inveniuntur a majoribus tradita non placuit iis dari locum nec admitti ad auctoritatem.&quot; 

==== Other meanings ====
In addition to the above three meanings strange uses of the term appear in the western church. Thus the Gelasian Decree includes the works of Eusebius, Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria, under this designation. Augustine (''De Civ. Dei'', xv. 23) explains it as meaning obscurity of origin, while Jerome (''Protogus Galeatus'') declares that all books outside the Hebrew canon belong to this class of apocrypha. Jerome's practice, however, did not square with his theory. The western church did not accept Jerome's definition of apocrypha, but retained the word in its original meaning, though great confusion prevailed. Thus the degree of estimation in which the apocryphal books have been held in the church has varied much according to place and time. As they stood in the Septuagint or Greek canon, along with the other books, and with no marks of distinction, they were practically employed by the Greek Fathers in the same way as the other books; hence Origen, Clement and others often cite them as &quot;scripture,&quot; &quot;divine scripture,&quot; &quot;inspired,&quot; and the like. On the other hand, teachers connected with Palestine, and familiar with the Hebrew canon, rigidly exclude all but the books contained there. This view is reflected, for example, in the canon of Melito of Sardis, and in the prefaces and letters of Jerome. Augustine, however (''De Doct. Christ''. ii. 8), attaches himself to the other side. Two well-defined views in this way prevailed, to which was added a third, according to which the books, though not to be put in the same rank as the canonical scriptures of the Hebrew collection, yet were of value for moral uses and to be read in congregations,--and hence they were called &quot;ecclesiastical&quot;--a designation first found in Rufinus (''ob''. 410). Notwithstanding the decisions of some councils held in Africa, which were in favour of the view of Augustine, these diverse opinions regarding the apocryphal books continued to prevail in the church down through the ages till the great dogmatic era of the Reformation. At that epoch the same three opinions were taken up and congealed into dogmas, which may be considered characteristic of the churches adopting them. In 1546 the council of Trent adopted the canon of Augustine, declaring &quot;He is also to be anathema who does not receive these entire books, with all their parts, as they have been accustomed to be read in the Catholic Church, and are found in the ancient editions of the Latin Vulgate, as sacred and canonical.&quot; The whole of the books in question, with the exception of 1st and 2nd Esdras, and the Prayer of Manasses, were declared canonical at Trent. On the other hand, the Protestants universally adhered to the opinion that only the books in the Hebrew collection are canonical. Already Wycliffe had declared that &quot;whatever book is in the Old Testament besides these twenty-five (Hebrew) shall be set among the apocrypha, that is, without authority or belief.&quot; Yet among the churches of the Reformation a milder and a severer view prevailed regarding the apocrypha. Both in the German and English translations (Luther's, 1537; Coverdale's, 1535, &amp;c.) these books are separated from the others and set by themselves; but while in some confessions, ''e.g''. the Westminster, a decided judgment is passed on them, that they are not &quot;to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings,&quot; a milder verdict is expressed regarding them in many other quarters, ''e.g''. in the &quot;argument&quot; prefixed to them in the Geneva Bible; in the Sixth Article of the Church of England, where it is said that &quot;the other books the church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners,&quot; though not to establish doctrine; and elsewhere.

== Old Testament apocryphal books == 

We shall now proceed to enumerate the apocryphal books: first the Apocrypha Proper, and next the rest of the Old and New Testament apocryphal literature. 

=== The Apocrypha Proper ===
or the apocrypha of the Old Testament as considered by English-speaking Protestants, consists of the following books: 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus (Sirach), Baruch, Epistle of Jeremiah, Additions to Daniel (Prayer of Azariah, Song of the Three Holy Children, History of Susannah, and Bel &amp; the Dragon), Prayer of Manasseh, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees. Thus the Apocrypha Proper constitutes the surplusage of the Vulgate or Bible of the Roman Catholic Church over the Hebrew Old Testament. Since this surplusage is in turn derived from the Septuagint, from which the old Latin version was translated, it thus follows that the difference between the Protestant and the Catholic Old Testament is, roughly speaking, traceable to the difference between the Palestinian and the Alexandrian canons of the Old Testament. But this is only true with certain reservations; for the Latin Vulgate was revised by Jerome according to the Hebrew, and, where Hebrew originals were wanting, according to the Septuagint. Furthermore, the Vulgate rejects 3 and 4 Maccabees and Psalm cli., which generally appear in the Septuagint, while the Septuagint and Luther's Bible reject 4 Ezra, which is found in the Vulgate and the Apocrypha Proper. Luther's Bible, moreover, rejects also 3 Ezra. It should further be observed that the Vulgate adds the Prayer of Manasses and 3 and 4 Ezra after the New Testament as apocryphal. 

It is hardly possible to form any classification which is not open to some objection. In any case the classification must be to some extent provisional, since scholars are still divided as to the original language, date and place of composition of some of the books which must come under our classification. (Thus some of the additions to Daniel and the Prayer of Manasseh are most probably derived from a Semitic original written in Palestine, yet in compliance with the prevailing opinion they are classed under Hellenistic Jewish literature. Again, the Slavonic [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]] goes back undoubtedly in parts to a Semitic original, though most of it may have been written by a Greek Jew in Egypt.) We may, however, discriminate 
* the Palestinian and
* the Hellenistic literature
of the Old Testament, though even this distinction is open to serious objections. The former literature was generally written in Hebrew or Aramaic, and seldom in Greek; the latter naturally in Greek. Next, within these literatures we shall distinguish three or four classes according to the nature of the subject with which they deal. Thus the books of which we have to treat will be classed as: 
* Historical,
* Legendary (Haggadic),
* Apocalyptic,
* Didactic or Sapiential. 

The Apocrypha Proper then would be classified as follows:--

*Palestinian Jewish Literature
**Historical 
***1 (i.e. 3) Ezra. 
***1 Maccabees.                
**Legendary
***Book of [[Baruch]]
***[[Book of Judith]] 
**Apocalyptic
***2 (i.e. 4) Ezra (see also [[Apocalyptic literature]])
**Didactic
***Sirach (see [[Ecclesiasticus]])  
***Tobit
*Hellenistic Jewish Literature:--
**Historical and Legendary
***Additions to [[Daniel]]
***Additions to [[Esther]]
***[[Epistle of Jeremy]]
***[[2 Maccabees]]
***Prayer of [[Manasses]]
**Didactic
***[[Book of Wisdom]]

Since all these books are dealt with in separate articles, they call for no further notice here.

=== Historical ===
==== History of Johannes Hyrcanus ====
The ''History of Johannes Hyrcanus'' is mentioned in 1 Macc. xvi. 23-24, but no trace has been discovered of its existence elsewhere. It must have early passed out of circulation, as it was unknown to Josephus. 

=== Legendary ===
==== Book of Jubilees ====
The ''Book of Jubilees'' was written in Hebrew between the year of the accession of Hyrcanus to the high-priesthood in 135 and his breach with the Pharisees some years before his death in 105 B.C. ''Jubilees'' was translated into Greek and from Greek into Ethiopic and Latin. It is preserved in its entirety only in Ethiopic. ''Jubilees'' is the most advanced pre-Christian representative of the midrashic tendency, which was already at work in the Book of Chronicles. This is a rewriting of the book of Genesis and the early chapters of Exodus. His work constitutes an enlarged targum on these books, and its object is to prove the everlasting validity of the law, which, though revealed in time, was superior to time. Writing in the palmiest days of the Maccabean dominion, he looked for the immediate advent of the Messianic kingdom. This kingdom was to be ruled over by a Messiah sprung not from Judah but from Levi, that is, from the reigning Maccabean family. This kingdom was to be gradually realized on earth, the transformation of physical nature going hand in hand with the ethical transformation of man. (For a fuller account see [[Book of Jubilees]].)

==== ''Paralipomena Jeremiae'', or the ''Rest of the Words of Baruch'' ====
This book has been preserved in Greek, Ethiopic, Armenian and Slavonic. The Greek was first printed at Venice in 1609, and next by Ceriani in 1868 under the title ''Paralipomena Jeremiae''. It bears the same name in the Armenian, but in Ethiopic it is known by the second title. (See [[Baruch]].)

==== Martyrdom of Isaiah ====
This Jewish work has been in part preserved in the ''Ascension of Isaiah''. To it belong i. 1, 2a, 6b-13a; ii. 1-8, 10-iii. 12; v. 1c-14 of that book. It is of Jewish origin, and recounts the martyrdom of Isaiah at the hands of Manasseh. (See [[Ascension of Isaiah]])

==== Pseudo-Philo's Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum ====
Though the Latin version of this book was thrice printed in the 16th century (in 1527, 1550 and 1599), it was practically unknown to modern scholars till it was recognized by [[F. C. Conybeare]] and discussed by Cohn in the ''Jewish Quarterly Review'', 1898, pp. 279-332. It is an Haggadic revision of the Biblical history from Adam to the death of Saul. Its chronology agrees frequently with the LXX. against that of the Massoretic text, though conversely in a few cases. The Latin is undoubtedly translated from the Greek. Greek words are frequently transliterated. While the LXX. is occasionally followed in its translation of Biblical passages, in others the Massoretic is followed against the LXX., and in one or two passages the text presupposes a text different from both. On many grounds Cohn infers a Hebrew original. The eschatology is similar to that taught in the similitudes of the [[Book of Enoch]]. In fact, Eth. En. li. 1 is reproduced in this connexion.  Prayers of the departed are said to be valueless. The book was written after A.D. 70; for, as Cohn has shown, the exact date of the fall of Herod's temple is predicted.

==== Life of Adam and Eve ====
Writings dealing with this subject are extant in Greek, Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Armenian and Arabic. They go back undoubtedly to a Jewish basis, but in some of the forms in which they appear at present they are christianized throughout. The oldest and for the most part Jewish portion of this literature is preserved to us in Greek, Armenian, Latin and Slavonic,
# The Greek Διηγησις περι Αδαμ και Ευας (published under the misleading title Αποκαλυψις Μωυσεως in Tischendorf's ''Apocalypses Apocryphae'', 1866) deals with the Fall and the death of Adam and Eve. Ceriani edited this text from a Milan MS. (''Monumenta Sacra et Profana'', v. i). This work is found also in Armenian, and has been published by the Mechitharist community in Venice in their ''Collection of Uncanonical Writings of the Old Testament'', and translated by Conybeare (''Jewish Quarterly Review'', vii. 216 sqq., 1895), and by Issaverdens in 1901.
# The ''Vita Adae et Evae'' is closely related and in part identical with the Διηγησις. It was printed by W. Meyer in ''Abh. d. Münch. Akad.'', Philos.-philol. Cl. xiv., 1878.
# The Slavonic Adam book was published by Jajic along with a Latin translation (''Denkschr. d. Wien. Akad. d. Wiss.'' xlii., 1893). This version agrees for the most part with the Διηγησις. It has, moreover, a section, §§ 28-39, which though not found in the Διηγησις is found in the ''Vita''.
# :Before we discuss these three documents we shall mention other members of this literature, which, though derivable ultimately from Jewish sources, are Christian in their present form,
# ''The Book of Adam and Eve'', also called the [[Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan]], translated from the Ethiopic (1882) by Malan.  This was first translated by Dillmann (''Das christl. Adambuch des Morgenlandes'', 1853), and the Ethiopic book first edited by Trump (''Abh. d. Münch. Akad.'' xv., 1870-1881).
# A Syriac work entitled ''Die Schalzhöhle'' translated by Bezold from three Syriac MSS. in 1883 and subsequently edited in Syriac in 1888.  This work has close affinities to the Conflict, but is said by Dillmann to be more original,

Armenian books on the ''Death of Adam'' (''Uncanonical Writings of O.T.'' pp. 84 sqq., 1901, translated from the Armenian), ''Creation and Transgression of Adam'' (op. cit. 39 sqq.), ''Expulsion of Adam from Paradise'' (op. cit. 47 sqq.), ''Penitence of Adam and Eve'' (op. cit. 71 sqq.) are mainly later writings from Christian hands.

Returning to the question of the Jewish origin of Διηγησις, ''Vita'', Slavonic Adam book, we have already observed that these spring from a common original.  As to the language of this original, scholars are divided. The evidence, however, seems to be strongly in favour of Hebrew.  How otherwise are we to explain such Hebraisms (or Syriacisms) as ευω ῥεει το ἑλαιον εξ αυτο&amp;upsilon (§ 9), οὑ ειπεν... μη φαγειν απ αυτου (§ 21). For others see §§ 23, 33. Moreover, as Fuchs has pointed out, in the words ἑση εν ματαιοις addressed to Eve (§ 25) there is a corruption of חבליס into הבליס. Thus the words were: &quot;Thou shalt have pangs.&quot; In fact, Hebraisms abound throughout this book. (See Fuchs, ''Apok. u. Pseud, d. A.T.'' ii. 511; ''Jewish Encyc.'' i. 179 sq.)

==== Jannes and Jambres ====
These two men are referred to in 2 Tim. iii. 8 as the Egyptian magicians who withstood Moses. The book which treats of them is mentioned by Origen (''ad Matt.'' xxiii. 37 and xxvii. 9 [''Jannes et Mambres Liber'']), and in the Gelasian Decree as the ''Paenitentia Jamnis et Mambre''. The names in Greek are generally Ιαννησ και Ιαμβρης (=יניס וימבריס) as in the Targ.-Jon. on Exod. i. 15; vii. ii. In the Talmud they appear as יוחני וממרא. Since the western text of 2 Tim. iii. 8 has Μαμβρης, Westcott and Hort infer that this form was derived from a Palestinian source. These names were known not only to Jewish but also to heathen writers, such as Pliny and Apuleius. The book, therefore, may go back to pre-Christian times. (See Schürer iii. 292-294; ''Ency. Biblica'', ii. 2327-2329.)

==== Joseph and Asenath ====
The statement in Gen. xli. 45, 50 that Joseph married the daughter of a heathen priest naturally gave offence to later Judaism, and gave rise to the belief that Asenath was really the daughter of Shechem and Dinah, and only the foster-daughter of Potipherah (''Targ.-Jon.'' on Gen. xli. 45; Tractat. ''Sopherim'', xxi. 9; ''Jalkut Shimoni'', c. 134. See Oppenheim, ''Fabula Josephi et Asenethae'', 1886, pp. 2-4). Origen also was acquainted with some form of the legend (''Selecta in Genesin'', ad Gen. xli. 45, ed. Lommatzsch, viii. 89-90). The Christian legend, which is no doubt in the main based on the Jewish, is found in Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Slavonic and Medieval Latin. Since it is not earlier than the 3rd or 4th century, it will be sufficient here to refer to Smith's ''Dict. of Christ. Biog.'' i. 176-177; Hastings' ''Bible Dict.'' i. 162-163; Schürer, iii. 289-291.

=== Didactic or Sapiential ===
==== Pirke Aboth ====
The ''Pirke Aboth'', a collection of sayings of the Jewish Fathers, are preserved in the 9th Tractate of the Fourth Order of the Mishnah. They are attributed to some sixty Jewish teachers, belonging for the most part to the years A.D. 70-170, though a few of them are of a much earlier date. The book holds the same place in rabbinical literature as the Book of Proverbs in the Bible. The sayings are often admirable. Thus in iv. 1-4, &quot;Who is wise? He that learns from every man.... Who is mighty? He that subdues his nature.... Who is rich? He that is contented with his lot....  Who is honoured? He that honours mankind.&quot; (See further [[Pirke Aboth]].)

== New Testament apocryphal literature == 

[[New Testament apocrypha]] &amp;mdash; books similar to those in the [[New Testament]] but rejected by Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants &amp;mdash; include several gospels and lives of apostles. Some of them were clearly produced by [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] authors or members of other groups later defined as [[heresy|heterodox]]. Many were discovered in the [[19th century|19th]] and [[20th century|20th centuries]], and produced lively speculation about the state of affairs in early [[Christianity]].

Though Protestants, Catholics and, in general, Orthodox agree on the canon of the [[New Testament]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] are reported by some scholars to add [[Epistles of Clement|I &amp; II Clement]], and [[Shepherd of Hermas]] to the [[New Testament]]. Others deny this. See [http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Bible/Text/Canon/ethiopican.html this link] for details.

[[Martin Luther (religious leader)|Martin Luther]] considered the [[Epistle of James]] apocryphal, because he highly doubted its authorship by any of the several New Testament figures named James, and because it contains a statement that seemed to contradict his teachings of [[Salvation#Christian views of salvation|Salvation]] by faith alone: &quot;Faith without works is dead&quot; (2:26). He had a similar feeling about the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], the [[Epistle of Jude]] and the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], and relegated those four books to an appendix in his Bible. Later [[Lutherans]] included these books as full parts in their New Testament, but kept them behind all the other books. The Lutheran New Testament (at least in [[German language|German]]) is thus arranged slightly differently from that of most other Churches.

The New Testament apocryphal book that is most famous today is the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the only complete text of which was found in [[Nag Hammadi]] along with other works, most of which were New Testament apocrypha. The entry on [[Gnosticism]] lists more recovered texts considered to be of Gnostic origin.

While the New Testament apocrypha are not seen as divinely inspired, artists and theologians have drawn on them for such matters as the names of [[Dismas]] and [[Gestas]] and details about the [[Three Wise Men]]. The first explicit expression on the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is found in the pseudepigraphical [[Infancy Gospel of James]].

An extensive online archive of New Testament Apocrypha is available at

=== Gospels ===
==== Uncanonical Sayings of the Lord in Christian and Jewish Sources ====
''Main Article: [[Agrapha]]''

Under the head of canonical sayings not found in the Gospels only one is found, i.e. that in Acts xx. 35.  The uncanonical sayings have been collected by Preuschen (''Reste der ausserkanonischen Evangelien'', 1901, pp. 44-47) and Hennecke (''NTliche Apok.'' 9-11). The same subject is dealt with in the elaborate volumes of Resch (''Aussercanonische Paralleltexte zu den Evangelien'', vols. i.-iii., 1893-1895).

To this section belongs also the ''Fayum Gospel Fragment'' and the ''Logia'' published by Grenfell and Hunt. [These editors have discovered (1907) a gospel fragment of the 2nd century which represents a dialogue between our Lord and a chief priest--a Pharisee.] The former contains two sayings of Christ and one of Peter, such as we find in the canonical gospels, Matt. xxvi. 31-34, Mark xiv. 27-30. The papyrus, which is of the 3rd century, was discovered by [[Gustav Bickell]] among the Rainer collection, who characterized it (''Z. f. kath. Theol.'', 1885, pp. 498-504) as a fragment of one of the primitive gospels mentioned in Luke i. 1. On the other hand, it has been contended that it is merely a fragment of an early patristic homily. (See [[Zahn]], ''Gesch. Kanons'', ii. 780-790; [[Harnack]], ''Texte und Untersuchungen'', v. 4; [[Preuschen]], op. cit. p. 19.) The ''[[Logia]]'' is the name given to the sayings contained in a papyrus leaf, by its discoverers Grenfell and Hunt. They think the papyrus was probably written about A.D. 200. According to Harnack, it is an extract from the ''Gospel of the Egyptians''. All the passages referring to Jesus in the Talmud are given by [[Laible]], ''Jesus Christus im Talmud'', with an appendix, &quot;Die talmudischen Texte,&quot; by [[Gustaf Dalman]] (2nd ed. 1901). The first edition of this work was translated into English by [[A. W. Streane]] (''Jesus Christ in the Talmud'', 1893). In [[Hennecke]]'s ''NTliche Apok. Handbuch'' (pp.47-71) there is a valuable study of this question by [[A. Meyer]], entitled ''Jesus, Jesu Jünger und das Evangelium im Talmud und verwandten jüdischen Schriften'', to which also a good bibliography of the subject is prefixed.

==== Gospel according to the Egyptians ====
This gospel is first mentioned by [[Clem. Alex.]] (''Strom.'' iii. 6. 45; 9. 63, 66; 13. 92), subsequently by [[Origen]] (''Hom. in Luc.'' i.) and [[Epiphanius]] (''Haer.'' lxii. 2), and a fragment is preserved in the so-called 2 Clem. Rom. xii. 2. It circulated among various heretical circles; amongst the [[Encratites]] (Clem. ''Strom.'' iii. 9), the [[Nassenes]] (Hippolyt. ''Philos.'' v. 7), and the [[Sabellians]] (Epiph. ''Haer.'' lxii. 2). Only three or four fragments survive; see [[Lipsius]] (Smith and [[Wace]], ''Dict. of Christ. Biog.'' ii. 712, 713); Zahn, ''Gesch. Kanons'', ii. 628-642; Preuschen, ''Reste d. ausserkanonischen Evangelien'', 1901, p. 2, which show that it was a product of [[pantheistic]] [[Gnosticism]]. With this pantheistic Gnosticism is associated a severe asceticism. The distinctions of sex are one day to come to an end; the prohibition of marriage follows naturally on this view. Hence Christ is represented as coming to destroy the work of the female (Clem. Alex. ''Strom.'' iii. 9. 63). Lipsius and Zahn assign it to the middle of the 2nd century. It may be earlier.

==== Protevangel of James ====
This title was first given in the 16th century to a writing which is referred to as ''The Book of James'' (ἡ βιβλος Ιακοβωυ) by Origen (tom. xi. ''in Matt.''). Its author designates it as Ἱστορια. For various other designations see [[Tischendorf]], ''Evang. Apocr.'' 1 seq. The narrative extends from the Conception of the Virgin to the Death of Zacharias. Lipsius shows that in the present form of the book there is side by side a strange &quot;admixture of intimate knowledge and gross ignorance of Jewish thought and custom,&quot; and that accordingly we must &quot;distinguish between an original Jewish Christian writing and a Gnostic recast of it.&quot; The former was known to Justin (''Dial.'' 78, 101) and Clem. Alex. (''Strom.'' vii. 16), and belongs at latest to the earliest years of the 2nd century. The Gnostic recast Lipsius dates about the middle of the 3rd century. From these two works arose independently the ''Protevangel'' in its present form and the Latin pseudo-Matthaeus (''Evangelium pseudo-Matthaei'').  The ''Evangelium de Nativitate Mariae'' is a redaction of the latter. (See Lipsius in Smith's ''Dict. of Christ. Biog.'' ii. 701-703.) But if we except the Zachariah and John group of legends, it is not necessary to assume the Gnostic recast of this work in the 3rd century as is done by Lipsius. The author had at his disposal two distinct groups of legends about Mary. One of these groups is certainly of non-Jewish origin, as it conceives Mary as living in the temple somewhat after the manner of a vestal virgin or a priestess of Isis. The other group is more in accord with the orthodox gospels. The book appears to have been written in Egypt, and in the early years of the 2nd century. For, since Origen states that many appealed to it in support of the view that the brothers of Jesus were sons of Joseph by a former marriage, the book must have been current about A.D. 200. From Origen we may ascend to Clem. Alex. who (''Strom.'' vi. 93) shows acquaintance with one of the chief doctrines of the book--the perpetual virginity of Mary. Finally, as Justin's statements as to the birth of Jesus in a cave and Mary's descent from David show in all probability his acquaintance with the book, it may with good grounds be assigned to the first decade of the 2nd century. (So Zahn, ''Gesch. Kanons'', i. 485, 499, 502, 504, 539; ii. 774-780.) For the Greek text see Tischendorf, ''Evang. Apocr.'' 1-50; B. P. Grenfell, ''An Alexandrian erotic Fragment and other Papyri'', 1896, pp. 13-17: for the Syriac, Wright, ''Contributions to Apocryphal Literature of the N.T.'', 1865, pp. 3-7; A. S. Lewis, ''Studia Sinaitica'', xi. pp. 1-22. See literature generally in Hennecke, ''NTliche Apok. Handbuch'', 106 seq.

==== Gospel of Nicodemus ====
This title is first met with in the 13th century. It is used to designate an apocryphal writing entitled in the older MSS. ὑπονηματα του Κυριου ἡμων Ιησου Χριστου πραχθεντα επι Ποντιου Πιλατου: also &quot;Gesta Salvatoris Domini... inventa Theodosio magno imperatore in Ierusalem in praetorio Pontii Pilati in codicibus publicis.&quot; See Tischendorf, ''Evang. Apocr.'' pp. 333-335. This work gives an account of the Passion (i.-xi.), the Resurrection (xii.-xvi.), and the ''Descensus ad Inferos'' (xvii.-xxvii.). Chapters i.-xvi. are extant, in the Greek, Coptic, and two Armenian versions. The two Latin versions and a Byzantine recension of the Greek contain i.-xxvii. (see Tischendorf, ''Evangelia Apocrypha'', pp. 210-458). All known texts go back to A. D. 425, if one may trust the reference to Theodosius. But this was only a revision, for as early as 376 Epiphanius (''Haer.'' i. 1.) presupposes the existence of a like text. In 325 Eusebius (''H.E.'' ii. 2) was acquainted only with the heathen ''Acts of Pilate'', and knew nothing of a Christian work. Tischendorf and Hofmann, however, find evidence of its existence in Justin's reference to the Ἁκτα Πιλατου (''Apol.'' i. 35, 48), and in Tertullian's mention of the ''Acta Pilati'' (''Apol.'' 21), and on this evidence attribute our texts to the first half of the 2nd century. But these references have been denied by Scholten, Lipsius, and Lightfoot. Recently Schubert has sought to derive the elements which are found in the Petrine Gospel, but not in the canonical gospels, from the original ''Acta Pilati'', while Zahn exactly reverses the relation of these two works. Rendel Harris (1899) advocated the view that the Gospel of Nicodemus, as we possess it, is merely a prose version of the Gospel of Nicodemus written originally in Homeric centones as early as the 2nd century. Lipsius and Dobschütz relegate the book to the 4th century. The question is not settled yet (see Lipsius in Smith's ''Dict. of Christ. Biography'', ii. 708-709, and Dobschütz in Hastings' ''Bible Dictionary'', iii. 544-547).

==== Gospel according to the Hebrews ====
This gospel was cited by Ignatius (''Ad Smyrnaeos'', iii.) according to Jerome (''Viris illus.'' 16, and ''in Jes.'' lib. xviii.), but this is declared to be untrustworthy by Zahn, op. cit. i. 921; ii. 701, 702. It was written in Aramaic in Hebrew letters, according to Jerome (''Adv. Pelag.'' iii. 2), and translated by him into Greek and Latin. Both these translations are lost. A collection of the Greek and Latin fragments that have survived, mainly in Origen and Jerome, will be found in Hilgenfeld's ''NT extra Canonem receptum'', Nicholson's ''Gospel according to the Hebrews'' (1879), Westcott's ''Introd. to the Gospels'', and Zahn's ''Gesch. des NTlichen Kanons'', ii. 642-723; Preuschen, op. cit. 3-8. This gospel was regarded by many in the first centuries as the Hebrew original of the canonical Matthew (Jerome, ''in Matt.'' xii. 13; ''Adv. Pelag.'' iii. 1). With the canonical gospel it agrees in some of its sayings; in others it is independent. It circulated among the Nazarenes in Syria, and was composed, according to Zahn (op. cit. ii. 722), between the years 135 and 150. Jerome identifies it with the ''Gospel of the Twelve'' (''Adv. Pelag.'' iii. 2), and states that it was used by the Ebionites (''Comm. in Matt.'' xii. 13). Zahn (op. cit. ii. 662, 724) contests both these statements. The former he traces to a mistaken interpretation of Origen (''Hom. I. in Luc.''). Lipsius, on the other hand, accepts the statements of Jerome (Smith and Wace, ''Dict. of Christian Biography'', ii. 709-712), and is of opinion that this gospel, in the form in which it was known to Epiphanius, Jerome and Origen, was &quot;a recast of an older original,&quot; which, written originally in Aramaic, was nearly related to the Logia used by St Matthew and the Ebionitic writing used by St Luke, &quot;which itself was only a later redaction of the Logia.&quot; 

According to the most recent investigations we may conclude that the Gospel according to the Hebrews was current among the Nazarenes and Ebionites as early as 100-125, since Ignatius was familiar with the phrase &quot;I am no bodiless demon&quot;--a phrase which, according to Jerome (''Comm. in Is.'' xviii.), belonged to this Gospel. 

The name &quot;Gospel according to the Hebrews&quot; cannot have been original; for if it had been so named because of its general use among the Hebrews, yet the Hebrews themselves would not have used this designation. It may have been known simply as &quot;the Gospel.&quot; The language was Western Aramaic, the mother tongue of Jesus and his apostles. Two forms of Western Aramaic survive: the Jerusalem form of the dialect, in the Aramaic portions of Daniel and Ezra; and the Galilean, in isolated expressions in the Talmud (3rd century), and in a fragmentary 5th century translation of the Bible. The quotations from the Old Testament are made from the Massoretic text. 

This gospel must have been translated at an early date into Greek, as Clement and Origen cite it as generally accessible, and Eusebius recounts that many reckoned it among the received books. The gospel is synoptic in character and is closely related to Matthew, though in the Resurrection accounts it has affinities with Luke. Like Mark it seems to have had no history of the birth of Christ, and to have begun with the baptism. (For the literature see Hennecke, ''NTliche Apok. Handbuch'', 21-23.) 

==== [[Gospel of Peter]] ====
Before 1892 we had some knowledge of this gospel. Thus Serapion, bishop of Antioch (A.D. 190-203) found it in use in the church of Rhossus in Cilicia, and condemned it as Docetic (Eusebius, ''H.E.'' vi. 12). Again, Origen (''In Matt.'' tom. xvii. 10) says that it represented the brethren of Christ as his half-brothers. In 1885 a long fragment was discovered at Akhmim, and published by Bouriant in 1892, and subsequently by Lods, Robinson, Harnack, Zahn, Schubert, Swete.

==== Gospel of Thomas ====
This gospel professes to give an account of Christ's boyhood. It appears in two recensions. The more complete recension bears the title Θωμα Ισραηλιτου Φιλοσοφου ῥητα εις τα παιδικα Κυριυ, and treats of the period from the 7th to the 12th year (Tischendorf, ''Evangelia Apocrypha'', 1876, 140-157). The more fragmentary recension gives the history of the childhood from the 5th to the 8th year, and is entitled Συγγραμμα του ἁγιου αποστολου Θωμα περι της παιδικης αναστροφης του Κυριου (Tischendorf, op. cit. pp. 158-163). Two Latin translations have been published in this work by the same scholar--one on pp. 164-180, the other under the wrong title, ''Pseudo-Matthaei Evangelium'', on pp. 93-112. A Syriac version, with an English translation, was published by Wright in 1875. This gospel was originally still more Docetic than it now is, according to Lipsius. Its present form is due to an orthodox revision which discarded, so far as possible, all Gnostic traces. Lipsius (Smith's ''Dict. of Christ. Biog.'' ii. 703) assigns it to the latter half of the 2nd century, but Zahn (''Gesch. Kan.'' ii. 771), on good grounds, to the earlier half. The latter scholar shows that probably it was used by Justin (''Dial.'' 88). At all events it circulated among the Marcosians (Irenaeus, ''Haer.'' i. 20) and the Naasenes (Hippolytus, ''Refut.'' v. 7), and subsequently among the Manichaeans, and is frequently quoted from Origen downwards (''Hom. I. in Luc.''). If the stichometry of Nicephorus is right, the existing form of the book is merely fragmentary compared with its original compass. For literature see Hennecke, ''NTliche Apokryphen Handbuch'', 132 seq.

==== Gospel of the Twelve ====
This gospel, which Origen knew (''Hom. I. in Luc.''), is not to be identified with the ''Gospel according to the Hebrews'' (see above), with Lipsius and others, who have sought to reconstruct the original gospel from the surviving fragments of these two distinct works. The only surviving fragments of the ''Gospel of the Twelve'' have been preserved by Epiphanius (''Haer.'' xxx. 13-16, 22: see Preuschen, op. cit. 9-11). It began with an account of the baptism. It was used by the Ebionites, and was written, according to Zahn (op. cit. ii. 742), about A.D. 170. 

==== Other gospels mainly Gnostic and almost all lost ====
===== Gospel of Andrew =====
This is condemned in the Gelasian Decree, and is probably the gospel mentioned by Innocent (1 Ep. iii. 7) and Augustine (''Contra advers. Leg. et Proph.'' i. 20). 

===== Gospel of Apelles =====
Mentioned by Jerome in his ''Prooem. ad Matt.''

===== Gospel of Barnabas =====
Condemned in the Gelasian Decree (see under [[Barnabas]] ''ad fin''.). 

===== Gospel of Bartholomew =====
Mentioned by Jerome in his ''Prooem. ad Matt.'' and condemned in the Gelasian Decree. 

===== Gospel of Basilides =====
Mentioned by Origen (''Tract. 26 in Matt.'' xxxiii. 34, and in his ''Prooem. in Luc.''); by Jerome in his ''Prooem. in Matt.'' (See Harnack i. 161; ii. 536-537; Zahn, ''Gesch. Kanons'', i. 763-774.) 

===== Gospel of Cerinthus =====
Mentioned by Epiphanius (''Haer.'' li. 7). 

===== Gospel of the Ebionites =====
A fragmentary edition of the canonical Matthew according to Epiphanius (''Haer.'' xxx. 13), used by the Ebionites and called by them the Hebrew Gospel. 

===== Gospel of Eve =====
A quotation from this gospel is given by Epiphanius (''Haer.'' xxvi. 2, 3). It is possible that this is the Gospel of Perfection which he touches upon in xxvi. 2. The quotation shows that this gospel was the expression of complete pantheism.

===== Gospel of James the Less =====
Condemned in the Gelasian Decree. 

===== Wisdom of Jesus Christ =====
This third work contained in the Coptic MS. referred to under ''Gospel of Mary'' gives cosmological disclosures and is presumably of Valentinian origin.

===== Apocryph of John =====
This book, which is found in the Coptic MS. referred to under ''Gospel of Mary'' and contains cosmological disclosures of Christ, is said to have formed the source of Irenaeus' account of the Gnostics of Barbelus (i. 29-31). Thus this work would have been written before 170.

===== Gospel of Judas Iscariot =====
References to this gospel as in use among the Cainites are made by Irenaeus (i. 31. 1); Epiphanius (xxxviii. 1. 3). 

===== Gospel, The Living (Evangelium Vivum) =====
This was a gospel of the Manichaeans. See Epiphanius, ''Haer''. lxvi. 2; Photius, ''Contra Manich''. i. 

===== Gospel of Marcion =====
On this important gospel see Zahn, ''Gesch. Kanons'', i. 585-718. 

===== Descent of Mary (Τεννα Μαριας) =====
This book was an anti-Jewish legend representing Zacharias as having been put to death by the Jews because he had seen the God of the Jews in the form of an ass in the temple (Epiphanius, ''Haer''. xxvi. 12). 

===== Questions of Mary (Great and Little) =====
Epiphanius (''Haer''. xxvi. 8) gives some excerpts from this work.

===== Gospel of Mary =====
This gospel is found in a Coptic MS. of the 5th century. According to Schmidt's short account, ''Sitzungsberichte d. preuss. Akad. d. Wiss. zu. Berlin'' (1896), pp. 839 sqq., this gospel gives disclosures on the nature of matter (ὑλη) and the progress of the Gnostic soul through the seven planets. 

===== Gospel of Matthias =====
Though this gospel is attested by Origen (''Horm. in Luc.'' i.), Eusebius, ''H.E.'' iii. 25. 6, and the List of Sixty Books, not a shred of it has been preserved, unless with Zahn ii. 751 sqq. we are to identify it with the ''Traditions of Matthias'', from which Clement has drawn some quotations. 

===== Gospel of Perfection (Evangelium perfectionis) =====
Used by the followers of Basilides and other Gnostics. See Epiphanius, ''Haer.'' xxvi. 2. 

===== Gospel of Philip =====
This gospel described the progress of a soul through the next world. It is of a strongly Encratite character and dates from the 2nd century. A fragment is preserved in Epiphanius, ''Haer''. xxvi. 13. In Preuschen, ''Reste'', p. 13, the quotation breaks off too soon. See Zahn ii. 761-768. 

===== Gospel of Thaddaeus =====
Condemned by the Gelasian Decree. 

===== Gospel of Thomas =====
Of this gospel only one fragment has been preserved in Hippolytus, ''Philos''. v. 7, pp. 140 seq. See Zahn, ''op. cit.'' i. 746 seq.; ii. 768-773; Harnack ii. 593-595.

===== Gospel of Truth =====
This gospel is mentioned by Irenaeus i. 11. 9, and was used by the Valentinians. See Zahn i. 748 sqq.

=== Acts and Teachings of the Apostles ===
==== Acts of Andrew ====
These Acts, which are of a strongly Encratite character, have come down to us in a fragmentary condition. They belong to the earliest ages, for they are mentioned by Eusebius, ''H.E.'' iii. 25; Epiphanius, ''Haer.'' xlvii. 1; lxi. 1; lxiii. 2; [[Philastrius]], ''Haer.'' lxviii., as current among the Manichaeans and heretics. They are attributed to [[Leucius]], a Docetic writer, by Augustine (''c. Felic. Manich.'' ii. 6) and [[Euodius]] (''De Fide c. Manich.'' 38). Euodius in the passage just referred to preserves two small fragments of the original Acts. On internal grounds the section recounting Andrew's imprisonment (Bonnet, ''Acta Apostolorum Apocrypha'', ii. 38-45) is also probably a constituent of the original work. As regards the martyrdom, owing to the confusion introduced by the multitudinous Catholic revisions of this section of the Acts, it is practically impossible to restore its original form. For a complete discussion of the various documents see Lipsius, ''Apokryphen Apostelgeschichte'', i. 543-622; also James in Hastings' ''Bible Dict.'' i. 92-93; Hennecke, ''NT. Apokryphen'', ''in loc.'' The best texts are given in Bonnet's ''Acta Apostolorum Apocrypha'', 1898, II. i. 1-127. These contain also the ''Acts of Andrew and Matthew'' (or Matthias) in which Matthew (or Matthias) is represented as a captive in the country of the anthropophagi. Christ takes Andrew and his disciples with Him, and effects the rescue of Matthew. The legend is found also in Ethiopic, Syriac and Anglo-Saxon. Also the ''Acts of Peter and Andrew'', which among other incidents recount the miracle of a camel passing through the eye of a needle. This work is preserved partly in Greek, but in its entirety in Slavonic. 

==== Acts of John ====
Clement of Alexandria in his ''Hypotyposes'' on 1 John i. 1 seems to refer to chapters xciii. (or lxxxix.) of these Acts. Eusebius (''H.E.'' iii. 25. 6), Epiphanius (''Haer.'' xlvii. 1) and other ancient writers assign them to the authorship of Leucius Charinus. It is generally admitted that they were written in the 2nd century. The text has been edited most completely by Bonnet, ''Acta Apostol. Apocr.'', 1898, 151-216. The contents might be summarized with Hennecke as follows:--Arrival and first sojourn of the apostle in Ephesus (xviii.-lv.); return to Ephesus and second sojourn (history of Drusiana, lviii.-lxxxvi.); account of the crucifixion of Jesus and His apparent death (lxxxvii.-cv.); the death of John (cvi.-cxv.). There are manifest gaps in the narrative, a fact which we would infer from the extent assigned to it (i.e. 2500 stichoi) by Nicephorus. According to this authority one-third of the text is now lost. Many chapters are lost at the beginning; there is a gap in chapter xxxvii., also before lviii., not to mention others. The encratite tendency in these Acts is not so strongly developed as in those of Andrew and Thomas. James (''Anecdota'', ii. 1-25) has given strong grounds for regarding the Acts of John and Peter as derived from one and the same author, but there are like affinities existing between the Acts of Peter and those of Paul. For a discussion of this work see Zahn, ''Gesch. Kanons'', ii. 856-865; Lipsius, ''Apok. Apostelgesch.'' i. 348-542; Hennecke, ''NT. Apokryphen'', 423-432. For bibliography, Hennecke, ''NT. Apok. Handbuch'', 492 sq. 

==== Acts of Paul ====
The discovery of the Coptic translation of these Acts in 1897, and its publication by C. Schmidt (''Acta Pauli aus der Heidelberger koptischen Papyrushandschrift herausgegeben'', Leipzig, 1894), have confirmed what had been previously only a hypothesis that the Acts of Thecla had formed a part of the larger Acts of Paul. The Acts therefore embrace now the following elements:-
* Two quotations given by Origen in his ''Princip.'' i. 2. 3 and his comment on John xx. 12. From the latter it follows that in the Acts of Paul the death of Peter was recounted,
* ''Apocryphal 3rd Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians'' and ''Epistle from the Corinthians to Paul''. These two letters are connected by a short account which is intended to give the historical situation. Paul is in prison on account of Stratonice, the wife of Apollophanes. The Greek and Latin versions of these letters have for the most part disappeared, but they have been preserved in Syriac, and through Syriac they obtained for the time being a place in the Armenian Bible immediately after 2 Corinthians. Aphraates cites two passages from 3 Corinthians as words of the apostle, and Ephraem expounded them in his commentary on the Pauline Epistles. They must therefore have been regarded as canonical in the first half of the 4th century.  From the Syriac Bible they made their way into the Armenian and maintained their place without opposition to the 7th century.  On the Latin text see Carrière and Berger, ''Correspondance apocr. de S. P. et des Corinthiens'', 1891. For a translation of Ephraem's commentary see Zahn ii. 592-611 and Vetter, ''Der Apocr. 3. Korinthien'', 70 sqq., 1894. The Coptic version (C. Schmidt, ''Acta Pauli'', pp. 74-82), which is here imperfect, is clearly from a Greek original, while the Latin and Armenian are from the Syriac.
* ''The Acts of Paul and Thecla''. These were written, according to Tertullian (''De Baptismo'', 17) by a presbyter of Asia, who was deposed from his office on account of his forgery. This, the earliest of Christian romances (probably before A.D. 150), recounts the adventures and sufferings of a virgin, Thecla of Iconium. Lipsius discovers Gnostic traits in the story, but these are denied by Zahn (''Gesch. Kanons'', ii. 902). See Lipsius, ''op. cit.'' ii. 424-467; Zahn (''op. cit.'' ii. 892-910). The best text is that of Lipsius, ''Acta Apostol. Apocr.'', 1891, i. 235-272.  There are Syriac, Arabic, Ethiopic and Slavonic versions. As we have seen above, these Acts are now recognized as belonging originally to the Acts of Paul. They were, however, published separately long before the Gelasian Decree (496). Jerome also was acquainted with them as an independent work. Thecla was most probably a real personage, around whom a legend had already gathered in the 2nd century. Of this legend the author of the Acts of Paul made use, and introduced into it certain historical and geographical facts,
* The healing of Hermocrates of dropsy in Myra. Through a comparison of the Coptic version with the Pseudo-Cyprian writing &quot;Caena,&quot; Rolffs (Hennecke, ''NT. Apok.'' 361) concludes that this incident formed originally a constituent of our book,
* The strife with beasts at Ephesus. This event is mentioned by Nicephorus Callistus (''H.E.'' ii. 25) as recounted in the περιοδοι of Paul. The identity of this work with the Acts of Paul is confirmed by a remark of Hippolytus in his commentary on Daniel iii. 29. 4, ed. Bonwetsch 176 (so Rolffs).
* Martyrdom of Paul. The death of Paul by the sentence of Nero at Rome forms the close of the Acts of Paul. The text is in the utmost confusion. It is best given by Lipsius, ''Acta Apostol. Apocr.'' i. 104-117. 

Notwithstanding all the care that has been taken in collecting the fragments of these Acts, only about 900 stichoi out of the 3600 assigned to them in the Stichometry of Nicephorus have as yet been recovered. 

The author was, according to Tertullian (''De Baptism.'' 17), a presbyter in Asia, who out of honour to Paul wrote the Acts, forging at the same time 3 Corinthians. Thus the work was composed before 190, and, since it most probably uses the martyrdom of Polycarp, after 155. The object of the writer is to embody in St Paul the model ideal of the popular Christianity of the 2nd century. His main emphasis is laid on chastity and the resurrection of the flesh. The tone of the work is Catholic and anti-Gnostic. For the bibliography of the subject see Hennecke, ''NT. Apok.'' 358-360. 

==== Acts of Peter ====
These acts are first mentioned by Eusebius (''H.E.'' iii. 3) by name, and first referred to by the African poet Commodian about A.D. 250. Harnack, who was the first to show that these Acts were Catholic in character and not Gnostic as had previously been alleged, assigns their composition to this period mainly on the ground that Hippolytus was not acquainted with them; but even were this assumption true, it would not prove the non-existence of the Acts in question. According to Photius, moreover, the Acts of Peter also were composed by this same Leucius Charinus, who, according to Zahn (''Gesch. Kanons'', ii. 864), wrote about 160 (''op. cit.'' p. 848). Schmidt and Ficker, however, maintain that the Acts were written about 200 and in Asia Minor. These Acts, which Ficker holds were written as a continuation and completion of the canonical Acts of the Apostles, deal with Peter's victorious conflict with Simon Magus, and his subsequent martyrdom at Rome under Nero. It is difficult to determine the relation of the so-called Latin ''Actus Vercellenses'' (which there are good grounds for assuming were originally called the Πραξεις Πετρου) with the Acts of John and Paul. Schmidt thinks that the author of the former made use of the latter, James that the Acts of Peter and of John were by one and the same author, but Ficker is of opinion that their affinities can be explained by their derivation from the same ecclesiastical atmosphere and school of theological thought. No less close affinities exist between our Acts and the Acts of Thomas, Andrew and Philip. In the case of the Acts of Thomas the problem is complicated, sometimes the Acts of Peter seem dependent on the Acts of Thomas, and sometimes the converse. 

For the relation of the ''Actus Vercellenses'' to the &quot;Martyrdom of the holy apostles Peter and Paul&quot; (''Acta Apostol. Apocr.'' i. 118-177) and to the &quot;Acts of the holy apostles Peter and Paul&quot; (''Acta Apostol. Apocr.'' i. 178-234) see Lipsius ii. 1. 84 sqq. The &quot;Acts of Xanthippe and Polyxena,&quot; first edited by James (''Texts and Studies'', ii. 3. 1893), and assigned by him to the middle of the 3rd century, as well as the &quot;Acts of the Disputation of Archelaus, bishop of Mesopotamia, and the Heresiarch Manes&quot; (&quot;Acta Disputationis Archelai Episcopi Mesopotamiae et Manetis Haeresiarchae,&quot; in Routh's ''Reliquiae Sacrae'', v. 36-206), have borrowed largely from our work. 

The text of the ''Actus Vercellenses'' is edited by Lipsius, ''Acta Apostol. Apocr.'' i. 45-79. An independent Latin translation of the &quot;Martyrdom of Peter&quot; is published by Lipsius (''op. cit.'' i. 1-22), ''Martyrium beati Petri Apostoli a Lino episcopo conscriptum''. On the Coptic fragment, which Schmidt maintains is an original constituent of these Acts, see that writer's work: ''Die alten Petrusakten im Zusammenhang der apokryphen Apostelliteratur nebst einem neuentdeckten Fragment'', and ''Texte und Untersuch''. N.F. ix. 1 (1903). For the literature see Hennecke, ''Neutestamentliche Apokryphen Handbuch'', 395 sqq. 

==== Preaching of Peter ====
This book (Πετρου κηρυγμα) gave the substance of a series of discourses spoken by one person in the name of the apostles. Clement of Alexandria quotes it several times as a genuine record of Peter's teaching. Heracleon had previously used it (see Origen, ''In Evang. Johann.'' t. xiii. 17). It is spoken unfavourably of by Origen (''De Prin.'' Praef. 8). It was probably in the hands of Justin and Aristides. Hence Zahn gives its date as 90-100 at latest; Dobschütz, as 100-110; and Harnack, as 110-130. The extant fragments contain sayings of Jesus, and warnings against Judaism and Polytheism. 

They have been edited by Hilgenfeld: ''Nov. Test. extra Can.'', 1884, iv. 51-65, and by von Dobschütz, ''Das Kerygma Petri'', 1893. Salmon (''Dict. Christ. Biog.'' iv. 329-330) thinks that this work is part of a larger work, ''A Preaching of Peter and a Preaching of Paul'', implied in a statement of Lactantius (''Inst. Div.'' iv. 21); but this view is contested by Zahn, see ''Gesch. Kanons'', ii. 820-834, particularly pp. 827-828; Chase, in Hastings' ''Bible Dict.'' iv. 776. 

==== Acts of Thomas ====
This is one of the earliest and most famous of the Gnostic Acts. It has been but slightly tampered with by orthodox hands. These Acts were used by the Encratites (Epiphanius, ''Haer.'' xlvii. 1), the Manichaeans (Augustine, ''Contra Faust''. xxii. 79), the Apostolici (Epiphanius lxi. 1) and Priscillianists. The work is divided into thirteen Acts, to which the Martyrdom of Thomas attaches as the fourteenth. It was originally written in Syriac, as Burkitt (''Journ. of Theol. Studies'', i. 278 sqq.) has finally proved, though Macke and Nöldeke had previously advanced grounds for this view. The Greek and Latin texts were edited by Bonnet in 1883 and again in 1903, ii. 2; the Greek also by James, ''Apoc. Anec.'' ii. 28-45, and the Syriac by Wright (''Apocr. Acts of the Gospels'', 1871, i. 172-333). Photius ascribes their composition to Leucius Charinus--therefore to the 2nd century, but Lipsius assigns it to the early decades of the 3rd. (See Lipsius, ''Apokryphen Apostelgeschichten'', i. 225-347; Hennecke, ''N.T. Apokryphen'', 473-480.) 

==== Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (Didache) ====
This important work was discovered by Philotheos Bryennios in Constantinople and published in 1883. Since that date it has been frequently edited. The bibliography can be found in Schaff's and in Harnack's editions. The book divides itself into three parts. The first (i.-vi.) contains a body of ethical instruction which is founded on a Jewish and probably pre-Christian document, which forms the basis also of the ''Epistle of Barnabas''. The second part consists of vii.-xv., and treats of church ritual and discipline; and the third part is eschatological and deals with the second Advent. The book is variously dated by different scholars: Zahn assigns it to the years A.D. 80-120; Harnack to 120-165; Lightfoot and Funk to 80-100; Salmon to 120. (See Salmon in ''Dict. of Christ. Biog.'' iv. 806-815, also article [[Didache]].) 

==== Apostolical Constitutions ====
For the various collections of these ecclesiastical regulations--the Syriac ''Didascalia, Ecclesiastical Canons of the Holy Apostles'', &amp;c.--see separate article [[Apostolical Constitutions]].

=== Epistles ===
==== The Abgar Epistles ====
These epistles are found in Eusebius (''H.E.'' i. 3), who translated them from the Syriac. They are two in number, and purport to be a petition of Abgar Uchomo, king of Edessa, to Christ to visit Edessa, and Christ's answer, promising after his ascension to send one of his disciples, who should &quot;cure thee of thy disease, and give eternal life and peace to thee and all thy people.&quot; Lipsius thinks that these letters were manufactured about the year 200. (See ''Dict. Christ. Biog.'' iv. 878-881, with the literature there mentioned.) The above correspondence, which appears also in Syriac, is inwoven with the legend of Addai or Thaddaeus. The best critical edition of the Greek text will be found in Lipsius, ''Acta Apostolorum Apocrypha'', 1891, pp. 279-283. (See also [[Abgar]].) 

==== Epistle of Barnabas ==== 
The special object of this epistle was to guard its readers against the danger of relapsing into Judaism. The date is placed by some scholars as early as 70-79, by others as late as the early years of the emperor Hadrian, 117. The text has been edited by Hilgenfeld in 1877, Gebhardt and Harnack in 1878, and Funk in 1887 and 1901. In these works will be found full bibliographies. (See further [[Barnabas]].) 

==== Epistle of Clement ====
The object of this epistle is the restoration of harmony to the church of Corinth, which had been vexed by internal discussions. The epistle may be safely ascribed to the years 95-96. The writer was in all probability the bishop of Rome of that name. He is named an apostle and his work was reckoned as canonical by Clement of Alexandria (''Strom.'' iv. 17. 105), and as late as the time of Eusebius (''H.E.'' iii. 16) it was still read in some of the churches. Critical editions have been published by Gebhardt and Harnack, ''Patr. Apost. Op.'', 1876, and in the smaller form in 1900, Lightfoot, 1890, Funk, 1901. The Syriac version has been edited by Kennet, ''Epp. of St Clement to the Corinthians in Syriac'', 1899, and the Old Latin version by Morin, ''S. Clementis Romani ad Corinthios epistulae versio Latina antiquissima'', 1894. 

==== &quot;Clement's&quot; 2nd Ep. to the Corinthians ====
This so-called letter of Clement is not mentioned by any writer before Eusebius (''H. E.'' iii. 38. 4). It is not a letter but really a homily written in Rome about the middle of the 2nd century. The writer is a Gentile. Some of his citations are derived from the Gospel to the Egyptians. 

==== Clement's Epistles on Virginity ====
These two letters are preserved only in Syriac which is a translation from the Greek. They are first referred to by Epiphanius and next by Jerome. Critics have assigned them to the middle of the 2nd century. They have been edited by [[Ian Theodor Beelen]], Louvain, 1856.

==== Clement's Epistles to James ====
On these two letters which are found in the Clementine Homilies, see Smith's ''Dict. of Christian Biography'', i. 559, 570, and Lehmann's monograph, ''Die Clementischen Schriften'', Gotha, 1867, in which references will be found to other sources of information. 

==== Epistles of Ignatius ====
There are two collections of letters bearing the name of Ignatius, who was martyred between 105 and 117. The first consists of seven letters addressed by Ignatius to the Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Romans, Philadelphians, Smyrnaeans and to Polycarp. The second collection consists of the preceding extensively interpolated, and six others of Mary to Ignatius, of Ignatius to Mary, to the Tarsians, Antiochians, Philippians and Hero, a deacon of Antioch. The latter collection is a pseudepigraph written in the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th. The authenticity of the first collection also has been denied, but the evidence appears to be against this contention. The literature is overwhelming in its extent. See Zahn, ''Patr. Apost. Op.'', 1876; Funk, ''Die apostol. Väter'', 1901; Lightfoot, ''Apostolic Fathers'', 1889. 

==== Epistle of Polycarp ====
The genuineness of this epistle stands or falls with that of the Ignatian epistles. See article in Smith's ''Dictionary of Christian Biography'', iv. 423-431; Lightfoot, ''Apostolic Fathers'', i. 629-702; also [[Polycarp]]. 

==== Pauline Epistles to the Laodiceans and the Alexandrians ====
The first of these is found only in Latin. This, according to Lightfoot (see ''Colossians'', 272-298) and Zahn, is a translation from the Greek. Such an epistle is mentioned in the Muratorian canon. See Zahn, ''op. cit.'' ii. 566-585. The Epistle to the Alexandrians is mentioned only in the Muratorian canon (see Zahn ii. 586-592). 

For the ''Third Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians'', and ''Epistle from the Corinthians to Paul'', see under &quot;Acts of Paul&quot; above.

===The Council of Jamnia ===
At least until the [[Council of Jamnia]] in [[92]] AD, [[Jew]]s did not have a single unified [[Biblical canon#Jewish canon|canon]] of Scripture. Some ancient Jewish sects (including the [[Essenes]], as evidenced in the [[Dead Sea scrolls]]) included as Scripture much that modern Jews consider non-canonical. The Council explicitly excluded certain books for reasons that included their late composition or because they were not written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] (although some parts of the [[Hebrew Bible]] or [[Tanakh]] itself are in [[Biblical Aramaic]]).  The word Apocrypha means hidden writing, and it was given to such books by the Jews to distinguish them from the books which they accepted as canonical.

Gentiles continued to use a Greek translation made in the period from the [[3rd century BC|third]] to the [[1st century BC|first]] centuries BC, in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. This work, which became known as the [[Septuagint]], included several books that were rejected at Jamnia. 

While Jews do not accept these books, saying they lack the unction of the prophetic books of the canon, they regard them as consistent, for most part, with the wisdom which rests on the fear of God and loyalty to His law, and some Jews have at various times drawn from them as a legitimate part of Jewish literary creativity, even using elements from them as the basis for two important parts of the Jewish liturgy.  

In the [[Mahzor]] (High Holy Day prayer book), a medieval Jewish poet used the book of [[Sirach]] as the basis for a beautiful poem, Ke'Ohel HaNimtah.

A closing [[piyyut]] in the [[Seder Avodah]] section, in the [[Yom Kippur]] Musaf begins:
:&quot;How glorious indeed was the High Priest, when he safely left the Holy of Holies.&lt;br /&gt;
:Like the clearest canopy of Heaven was the dazzling countenance of the priest.&quot;
&lt;!-- (This can be seen, for example, on page 828 of the Birnbaum edition of the Mahzor.) --&gt;
Mahzor replaces the medieval [[piyyut]] with the relevant section from Ben Sira, which is more direct.

Apocrypha have even formed the basis of the most important of all Jewish prayers, the [[Amidah]] (the Shemonah Esrah). Sirach provides the vocabulary and framework for many of the Amidah's blessings, which were instituted by the men of the Great Assembly. The description of the origins of [[Hanukkah]] is also to be found in the books rejected at Jamnia.

While the texts themselves may not be accepted as canonical, some of their contents are regarded as historical truth. In particular, [[1 Maccabees]] is cited by Jewish scholars as highly reliable history and was used by [[Josephus]] in his history of the Maccabean revolt.

===Majority Christian usage===
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] Churches (thus the great majority of Christians) accept as part of the Old Testament some books excluded from the Jewish canon.  Roman Catholics refer to them as [[deuterocanonical books]], a term first used by [[Sixtus of Siena]] in 1566, signifying that definitive recognition of their canonical status came later than that of the other books.  Catholics and Orthodox do not call these books &quot;apocrypha&quot;, a term they apply only to other books that fall within the definition given in the first paragraph of this article. 

The deuterocanonical books are ''[[Book of Tobit|Tobit]]'', ''[[Book of Judith|Judith]]'', ''[[1 Maccabees]]'', ''[[2 Maccabees]]'', ''[[Wisdom of Solomon]]'', ''[[Sirach|Sirach (Ecclesiasticus)]]'', and ''[[Book of Baruch|Baruch]]'', as well as some parts of ''[[Book of Esther|Esther]]'' and ''[[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]''.

Eastern Orthodox Churches sometimes also consider ''[[3 Maccabees]]'', ''[[4 Maccabees]]'', ''[[1 Esdras]]'' and/or ''[[2 Esdras]]'' to be deuterocanonical and include [[Psalm 151]] with the ''[[Psalms]]'', while the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] venerate additional books, such as ''[[Jubilees]]'', ''[[Book of Enoch|Enoch]]'', and the ''[[Rest of the Words of Baruch]]''. The inclusion of Enoch is justified on the grounds that the ''Book of [[Jude]]'' quotes it as Scripture. See [http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Bible/Text/Canon/ethiopican.html here] for conflicting accounts on what is actually included in the Ethiopian canon.

Since there was no fixed canon even among Jews until the Council of Jamnia (c.70-90 CE), it is not surprising that, historically, there have been hesitations among Christians, especially in the early centuries, about which [[Old Testament]] books to consider canonical. The inability of Christians to use in controversy with Jews books that the latter did not accept as divinely inspired was one reason why some attributed lesser authority to these books. St Jerome explicitly denied the canonical character of any Old Testament book not included in the Hebrew Bible; but later, in his Preface to the Book of Tobit (PL 29, 24-25), stated that he translated the deuterocanonical books into Latin as a concession to the authority of the bishops; and in [[402]] CE declared he had not really denied the inspiration of these books, but had only given the opinion of the Jews (''Apol. contra Ruf.'' 11, 33. PL 23, 476).

In view of that controversy, a list of canonical books (with the deuterocanonical books included) was drawn up at councils in Africa and approved (though not in ''ex cathedra'' form, which would have been anachronistic, in any event) by the Pope of the time. This was generally accepted in the West, while in the East, particularly in Syria, general agreement was reached only in the seventh century. Within the Roman Catholic Church, individual leaders and scholars, even at a later date, sometimes expressed contrary views, but the matter was definitively settled in [[1546]], when the [[Council of Trent]], reacting to the views of the Protestant Reformers, declared that it accepted all the books of the Old and New Testaments with equal feelings of piety and reverence, and named them in accordance with the list of the fifth-century African councils. The [[First Vatican Council]] reaffirmed this declaration.

=== Protestant views ===
[[Martin Luther (religious leader)|Martin Luther]] rejected the books that do not appear in the Jewish Tanakh, partly because of the stress the Reformers laid on translating from the original text, and partly because some passages contradicted his views, especially where [[2 Maccabees]] speaks, by implication, of [[purgatory]]: &quot;It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins.&quot; (12:46).

Protestants called the deuterocanonical books apocrypha. Luther and the Anglican Church regarded them as useful for edification, but not to be relied upon for doctrine, while Calvin and in general his followers attached no value to them beyond that of any other human writing, and objected to any use of them in church. 	

In [[1615]], the Archbishop of Canterbury imposed a year’s imprisonment for publishing Bibles without the &quot;Apocrypha&quot;; but in later printings of the Bible in English these books were omitted more and more. In the early nineteenth century, the Edinburgh Bible Society denounced them as superstitious and absurd, and soon all the Bible Societies decided not to publish them. More recently, in spite of the expense involved, Protestant Bibles in English have again sometimes included them, placing them in a separate section either between the Old Testament and the New or at the end.

What most Christians consider to be integral parts of Esther and Daniel are in some instances counted by Protestants as additional books.  In the book of Esther, it is difficult to separate these from the rest, since they are tightly integrated into the Greek text, and even the common parts of the book contain small variations from the Hebrew text. Protestant Bibles therefore sometimes give the entire book of Esther in two versions, one, based on the Hebrew text, as part of the Protestant Old Testament, and one, translated from the Greek, in the &quot;Apocrypha&quot; section.

Not all Protestants have omitted the deuterocanonical books. For example, all Luther Bibles in the Lutheran areas of [[Germany]] included them until [[World War II]]. Only after the war, when American [[Bible Society|Bible Societies]] offered funding on condition that the Apocrypha were omitted, they began to be dropped from most editions.  Additionally, the original edition of the KJV (1611) included them between the Old and New Testaments.

===Latter Day Saint views===
Adherents of [[Latter Day Saint]] denominations believe that [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], as a prophet, received a revelation from [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] in answer to a question about the validity of the (Protestant) Apocrypha at [[Kirtland, Ohio]] on [[March 9]], [[1833]], which is now [http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/91 Section 91] of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]. The section reads in part:

:There are many things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated correctly; there are many things contained therein that are not true, which are interpolations by the hands of men&amp;mdash;Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him understand, for the Spirit manifesteth truth; And whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom.

This echoes the sentiment of most American Protestants of his day.

Although the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS), the largest Latter Day Saint denomination, typically uses editions of the [[King James Version]] (KJV) of the Bible that do not currently include the Apocrypha, these have been used by members and leaders in the past, especially when such editions were more readily available. In non-English-speaking lands, Latter Day Saints use Bibles other than the KJV, some of which include the Apocrypha. The LDS Church plays a part in distributing such Bibles.  

Latter Day Saints generally believe that &quot;The Apocrypha&quot; are of questionable authenticity, but have some value. However, they place more emphasis on other hidden records which have been revealed and are believed to be reliable, such as the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Joseph Smith Translation]], [[Book of Abraham]], a translation of writings of John (see [[Doctrine and Covenants]] 93:6-18 [http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/93/6-18#6] and other ancient records or &quot;hidden books&quot; which will come forth in time and be revealed as mankind are ready to accept new knowledge.

{{Roman government}}
'''''Augustus''''' (plural '''''augusti''''') is [[Latin]] for &quot;majestic&quot; or &quot;venerable&quot;. The  feminine form is '''''Augusta'''''.
The Greek equivalent is [[sebastos]], or a mere grecization (by changing of the ending) ''augustos''.

==Origin and nature==
Although the use of the ''[[Roman naming convention|cognomen]]'' &quot;Augustus&quot; as part of one's name is generally understood to identify the [[Caesar Augustus|Emperor Augustus]], this is somewhat misleading; &quot;Augustus&quot; was the most significant name associated with the Emperor, but it did not actually represent any sort of constitutional office. The Imperial dignity was not an ordinary office, but rather an extraordinary concentration of ordinary powers in the hands of one man; &quot;Augustus&quot; was the name that unambiguously identified that man.

*The first &quot;Augustus&quot; (and first man counted as a [[Roman Emperor]]) was [[Caesar Augustus|Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus]], who was given that name by the [[Roman Senate]] on [[January 16]], [[27 BC]]; over the next forty years, Caesar Augustus (as he is now known) literally set the standard by which subsequent Emperors could be recognised, by accumulating various offices and powers and making his own name (&quot;Augustus&quot;) identifiable with the consolidation of powers. Although the name signified nothing in constitutional theory, it was recognised as representing all the powers that Caesar Augustus had accumulated.

As ''[[princeps senatus]]'' (lit., &quot;prince of the senate&quot;, &quot;first man of the senate&quot;) he was the parliamentary leader of the house in the Senate and received diplomatic embassages on behalf of that body; as ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' (lit. &quot;greatest bridgemaker&quot;) he was the chief priest of the Roman state religion; as bearing [[consul]]ar ''[[imperium]]'' he had [[authority]] equal to the official chief (and [[eponym]]ous) magistrates within [[Rome]] and as bearing ''imperium maius'' he had authority greater than theirs outside Rome (because of this, he outranked all provincial governors and was also supreme commander of all Roman [[legion]]s); as bearing ''[[tribune|tribunicia potestas]]'' (&quot;tribunician power&quot;) he had personal inviolability (''sacrosanctitas'') and the right to [[veto]] any act or proposal by any magistrate within Rome. In a famous passages of ''Res Gestae'', Augustus claims for him, as ''princeps'', ''[[auctoritas]]'', has underlined philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]. This concentration of powers became the model by which all subsequent Emperors ruled Rome in constitutional theory (in practice this systematic and sophisticated theory gradually lost any resemblance to reality in the [[3rd century|III]] and [[4th century|IV centuries]], when the Emperors became rather more reminiscent of oriental despots than &quot;first among equals&quot;).

*Octavian &quot;Caesar Augustus&quot; also set the standard by which Roman Emperors were named. The three titles used by the majority of Roman Emperors -- &quot;''[[imperator]]''&quot;, &quot;''[[Caesar (title)|caesar]]''&quot; and &quot;''augustus''&quot; -- were all used personally by Caesar Augustus (he officially styled himself &quot;Imperator Caesar Augustus&quot;); of these names, only &quot;Augustus&quot; was unique to the Emperor himself, as others could and did bear the titles &quot;Imperator&quot; and &quot;Caesar&quot; (it should be noted, however, that the Emperor's mother or wife could bear the name &quot;Augusta&quot;). It became customary for an Emperor-designate to adopt the name ''NN. Caesar'' (where NN. is the individual's personal name) or later ''NN. Nobilissimus Caesar'' (&quot;NN. Most Noble Caesar&quot;), and occasionally to be awarded the title ''Princeps Iuventutis'' (&quot;Prince of Youth&quot;). Upon accession to the purple, the new Emperor usually adopted the name ''Imperator Caesar NN. Augustus'' (later Emperors took to inserting ''Pius Felix'', &quot;Pious and Blest&quot;, and ''Invictus'', &quot;Unconquered&quot;, between their personal names and ''Augustus'').

In this usage, by signifying the complete assumption of all Imperial powers, &quot;''Augustus''&quot; is roughly analogous to &quot;[[Emperor]]&quot;, though a modern reader should be careful not to project onto the ancients a modern, monarchical understanding of what an emperor is. As noted, there was no constitutional office associated with the imperial dignity; the Emperor's personal authority (''dignitas'') and influence (''[[auctoritas]]'') derived from his position as ''princeps senatus'', and his legal authority derived from his ''consulari imperium'' and ''tribunicia potestas''; in Roman constitutional theory, one might consider &quot;''augustus''&quot;  as being shorthand for &quot;''princeps senatus et pontifex maximus consulari imperio et tribuniciae potestate''&quot; (loosely, &quot;Leader of the House and Chief Priest with Consular ''Imperium'' and Tribunician Power&quot;).

In many ways, &quot;''augustus''&quot; is comparable to the [[United Kingdom|British]] dignity of [[prince]]; it is a personal title, dignity, or attribute rather than a title of nobility such as [[duke]] or king. The Emperor was most commonly referred to as ''princeps'' (''[[basileus]]'', &quot;[[sovereign]]&quot;, in Greek).

==Women of the Imperial dynasty==
Originally, the title '''Augusta''' was only exceptionally bestowed on women of the Imperial dynasties: for these women it meant a fortification of their worldly power, and a status near to divinity. There was no qualification with higher prestige.

The first woman to receive it was [[Livia Drusilla]], by the last will of her husband [[Emperor Augustus]] (14 AD). Hence she was known as [[Julia Augusta]]. As much as Augustus was the model for all further Augustusses, Julia Augusta was the model for all further Augustas. A model that included scheming for a son to become successor to the throne, and falling in disgrace under the new Emperor if the scheming had been successful.

[[Agrippina minor]], becoming &quot;Augusta&quot; under her last husband [[Claudius]], would oblige to the model, being sent to death by her son [[Nero]], a few years after he had become Emperor.

If ''Augustus'' as honorific could be compared to the title of ''Prince'' in moderner societies, then ''Augusta'' would not so much be ''Princess'' than rather something more exceptional like ''[[Princess Royal]]'', deliberately given by the reigning monarch in rare cases, to a relative that received by this title prominence among other members of the royal household. Of course, it's only a partial comparison: ''Princess Royal'' was a title most often received by younger women, while ''Augusta'' was rather reserved for the aged - in this sense ''Augusta'' has something of the connotation of ''[[Queen mum]]'' too. Further, the &quot;akin to divinity&quot; does not really translate in any of these moderner titles or understood honorifics.

==In the Divided Roman Empire==
Later, under the [[Tetrarchy]], the rank of &quot;''augustus''&quot; referred to the two senior Emperors (in East and West), while &quot;''caesar''&quot; referred to the junior sub-Emperors. 

The aforementioned three principal titles of the emperors -- &quot;''imperator''&quot;, &quot;''caesar''&quot;, and &quot;''augustus''&quot; -- were rendered as ''[[autocrat|autokratôr]]'', ''kaisar'', and ''augustos'' (or ''sebastos'') in Greek. The Greek title continued to be used in the [[Byzantine Empire]] until its extinction in [[1453]], although &quot;''sebastos''&quot; lost its Imperial exclusivity: persons who were not the Emperor could receive titles formed from &quot;''sebastos''&quot;, and &quot;''autokratôr''&quot; became the exclusive title of the Emperor.

==Legacy==
The Latin title of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s was usually &quot;''Imperator Augustus''&quot;, which conveys the modern understanding of &quot;emperor&quot; rather than the original Roman sense (i.e., the &quot;first citizen&quot; of the Republic). Ironically, although the [[German language|German]] word for &quot;emperor&quot; is &quot;''Kaiser''&quot;, a clear derivative of &quot;''caesar''&quot;, that was the only one of the three principal titles of the Latin- and Greek-speaking Roman Emperors that was not regularly used in Latin by the German-speaking Holy Roman Emperors.

The '''Antarctic Treaty''' and related agreements, collectively called the '''Antarctic Treaty System''' or '''ATS''', regulate the [[international relations]] with respect to [[Antarctica]], [[Earth]]'s only uninhabited [[continent]]. For the purposes of the [[treaty]] system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[Circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and banned military activity on that [[continent]]. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]].

== The Antarctic Treaty System ==

[[Image:Antarctica.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Research stations and territorial claims in Antarctica (2002).]]

=== The (Main) Antarctic Treaty ===

The main treaty was opened for signature on [[December 1]], [[1959]], and officially entered into force on [[June 23]], [[1961]]. The original signatories were the 12 countries active in Antarctica during the [[International Geophysical Year]] of 1957-58 and willing to accept a US invitation to the conference at which the treaty was negotiated. These countries were [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Chile]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[South Africa]], the U.S.S.R., the [[United Kingdom]] and the United States (which opened the [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] for the [[International Geophysical Year]]).

==== Articles of the Antarctic Treaty ====

*'''Article 1''' - area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel and equipment may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose; 

*'''Article 2''' - freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation shall continue; 

*'''Article 3''' - free exchange of information and personnel in cooperation with the [[United Nations]] and other international agencies; 

*'''Article 4''' - does not recognize, dispute, or establish territorial claims and no new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force; 

*'''Article 5''' - prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes; 

*'''Article 6''' - includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees 00 minutes south; 

*'''Article 7''' - treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial observation, to any area and may inspect all stations, installations, and equipment; advance notice of all activities and of the introduction of military personnel must be given; 

*'''Article 8''' - allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own states; 

*'''Article 9''' - frequent consultative meetings take place among member nations; 

*'''Article 10''' - treaty states will discourage activities by any country in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty; 

*'''Article 11''' - disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or, ultimately, by the [[International Court of Justice]]; 

*'''Articles 12, 13, 14''' - deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved nations.

The main objective of the ATS is to ensure &lt;cite&gt; in the interests of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord &lt;/cite&gt;. The treaty forbids &lt;cite&gt; any measures of a military nature&lt;/cite&gt;, but not the presence of military personnel per se. It also defers the question of territorial claims asserted by some nations and not recognized by others.

=== Other agreements ===
[[Image:wiki_antarctictreaty.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Stamp, [[USA]], [[1991]]]]
Other agreements - some 200 recommendations adopted at treaty consultative meetings and ratified by governments - include:
* [[Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora]] (1964) (entered into force in 1982)
* The [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals]] (1972)
* The [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (1980)
* The [[Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities]] (1988) (although it was signed in 1988, it was subsequently rejected and never entered into force)
* The [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] was signed [[4 October]] [[1991]] and entered into force [[14 January]] [[1998]]; this agreement prevents development and provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment through five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental impact assessments, waste management, and protected areas. It prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources except scientific research.

==Meetings==
The Antarctic Treaty System's yearly ''Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM)'' are the international forum for the administration and management of the region. Only 28 of the 45 parties to the agreements have the right to participate in these meetings. These parties are the ''Consultative Parties'' and, in addition to the twelve original signatories, include 16 countries that have demonstrated their interest in Antarctica by carrying out substantial scientific activity there.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Claims overlap.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; Reserved the right to claim areas.

At the end of 2004, there were 45 treaty member nations: 28 consultative and 17 acceding. Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica as national territory. The 20 nonclaimant nations do not recognize the claims of others.

== Legal system ==

Antarctica has no [[government]]. Various countries claim areas of it, but most countries do not recognize those claims. The area between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west is the only land on Earth not claimed by any country.

===Argentina and Chile===

According to Argentine regulations, any crime committed within 50 [[kilometer]]s of any Argentine base is to be judged in [[Ushuaia]] (as capital of [[Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica, and South Atlantic Islands]]). In the part of [[Argentine Antarctica]] that is also claimed by Chile, the person to be judged can ask to be transferred there.

===United States===

The [[law of the United States]], including certain criminal offenses by or against U.S. nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under jurisdiction of other countries. To this end, the United States now stations special deputy [[United States Marshal|U. S. Marshals]] in Antarctica to provide a law enforcement presence. [http://www.usmarshals.gov/history/antarctica/]

Some U.S. laws directly apply to Antarctica. For example, the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]], 16 [[U.S.C.]] section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the following activities, unless authorized by regulation of [[statute]]:

*the taking of native mammals or birds;
*the introduction of nonindigenous plants and animals;
*entry into specially protected or scientific areas;
*the discharge or disposal of pollutants;
*the importation into the U.S. of certain items from Antarctica

Violation of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines and one year in prison. The Departments of [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]], [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce]], [[United States Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]] share enforcement responsibilities.

Public Law 95-541, the Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires expeditions from the U.S. to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the [[Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs]] of the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], which reports such plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty.

Further information is provided by the [[Office of Polar Programs]] of the [[National Science Foundation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Swinburne.jpg|thumb|150px|Algernon Swinburne, Portrait by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]] ]]
'''Algernon Charles Swinburne''' ([[April 5]], [[1837]] &amp;ndash; [[April 10]], [[1909]]) was a [[Victorian era]] [[England|English]] poet. His [[poetry]] was highly controversial in its day, much of it containing recurring themes of [[sadomasochism]], death-wish, [[lesbian|lesbianism]] and anti-[[Christianity|Christian]] sentiments.

Swinburne was born in [[London]], and raised on the [[Isle of Wight]], and at [[Capheaton Hall]], near [[Wallington Hall|Wallington]], [[Northumberland]]. He was associated with the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement, and counted among his best friends [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]].

He is considered a ''[[Decadence|decadent]]'' poet, albeit that he professed to perhaps rather more vice than he actually indulged in, a fact which [[Oscar Wilde]] notably and acerbically commented upon.

Many of his early and still admired poems evoke the Victorian fascination with the [[Middle Ages]], and some of them are explicitly [[medieval_(term)|medieval]] in style, tone and construction, these representatives notably being &quot;The Leper,&quot; &quot;Laus Veneris,&quot; and &quot;St Dorothy&quot;.

He was an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] and a highly excitable character. His health suffered as a result, until he finally broke down and was taken into care by his friend [[Theodore Watts]], who looked after him for the rest of his life in [[Putney]]. Thereafter he lost his youthful rebelliousness and developed into a figure of social respectability.

His [[vocabulary]], [[rhyme]] and [[Meter (poetry)|metre]] arguably make him one of the best poets of the [[English language]]; but his poetry has been criticized as overly flowery and meaningless, choosing words to fit the rhyme rather than to contribute towards meaning.

Works include: ''Atalanta in Calydon'', ''Poems and Ballads'' (series I, II and III -- these contain most of his more controversial works), ''Songs Before Sunrise'', ''Lesbia Brandon'' (novel published posthumously).

He also wrote poems in favour of the unification of [[Italy]]. He was a student at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and his work in his day was very popular among undergraduates at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], though today it has largely gone  out of fashion. This, at least, is the current popular and even the academic view of the decline of Swinburne's reputation, but it contains some distortion.

In fact Swinburne's ''Poems and Ballads, First Series'' and his ''Atalanta in Calydon'' have never been out of critical favor. It was Swinburne's misfortune that the two works, published when he was nearly 30, soon established him as England's premier poet, the successor to [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] and [[Robert Browning]]. This was a position he held in the popular mind until his death, but sophisticated critics like [[A. E. Housman]] felt, rightly or wrongly, that the job of being one of England's very greatest poets was beyond him.

Swinburne may have felt this way himself. He was a highly intelligent man and in later life a much-respected critic, and he himself believed that the older a man was, the more cynical and less trustworthy he became. Swinburne may have been one of the first people not to trust anyone over thirty. This of course created problems for him after he himself passed that age. 

After the first ''Poems and Ballads'', Swinburne's later poetry is devoted more to politics and philosophy. He does not utterly stop writing love poetry, but he is far less shocking. His versification, and especially his rhyming technique, remain masterful to the end. He is the virtual star of the third volume of [[George Saintsbury]]'s famous ''History of English Prosody'', and Housman, a more measured and even somewhat hostile critic, devoted paragraphs of praise to his rhyming ability. 

It should also be noted that Swinburne continues to impact today's culture though in small degree. In the [[Cradle of Filth]] song &quot;The Forest Whispers My Name&quot; from the album The Principle Of Evil Made Flesh (1994) the following selection from Swinburne's ''The Garden of Proserpine'' can be found:

&quot;Pale, beyond porch and portal,
Crowned with leaves, she stands,
Who gathers all things mortal,
With cold immortal hands,
Her languid lips are sweeter,
Than love's who fears to greet her,
To men that mix and meet her,
From many times and lands.&quot;

The other lyrics of Cradle of Filth also follow a similar vein as the writings of Swinburne. Themes of romance, love lost, mythical imagery and the macabre are frequent and a clear Swinburne influence is apparent.

Some of his poems:
*[[Hymn to Proserpine]]
*[[The Triumph of Time]]

==Trivia==

'''Ernest Wheldrake''' was a fictional character invented by Swinburne, who reviewed imaginary works by him. This was as a satire on the [[spasmodic poets]]. Wheldrake is also a character used by [[Michael Moorcock]] in his fiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alfred William Lawson''' ([[1869]]-[[1954]]) was a professional [[baseball]] player from 1887 through 1908 and went on to play a pioneering role in the US aircraft industry, publishing an early aviation trade journal.  During this time he also wrote a novel, Born Again, clearly inspired by the popular Utopian fantasy [[Looking Backward]] by [[Edward Bellamy]], an early harbinger of the metaphysical turn his career would take. He is frequently cited as the inventor of the [[airliner]] and claimed to have been the first to deliver air mail on a schedule.  However, his several attempts at building his own airplanes all ended in crashes which discouraged investors.

In the 1920s he promoted [[vegetarianism]] and claimed to have found the secret of living to 200.  He also developed his own highly unusual theories of physics, according to which such concepts as &quot;penetrability&quot; and &quot;zig-zag-and-swirl&quot; were discoveries on par with [[Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]].  Numerous books confidently expounding on these concepts flowed from his pen, all set in the distinctive typography which makes Lawson publications recognizable at 50 paces.  Most of the books confidently predict the worldwide adoption of Lawsonian principles by the year 2000.

He later propounded his own philosophy [[Lawsonomy]], and the [[Lawsonian religion]]. He also developed during the [[Great Depression]] the [[populist]] economic theory of [[direct credit]]s, according to which banks are the cause of all economic woe, the oppressors of both capital and labour. Lawson believed that the government should replace banks as the provider of loans to business and workers. His rallies and lectures attracted thousands of listeners in the early 30s, mainly in the upper midwest, but by the late 30s the crowds had dwindled.

In 1943 he founded the so-called University of Lawsonomy in Des Moines to spread his teachings and offer the degree of &quot;Knowlegian,&quot; but after various IRS and other investigations it was closed and finally sold in 1954, the year of Lawson's death.  Lawson's financial arrangements remain mysterious to this day and in later years he seems to have owned little property, moving from city to city as a guest of his farflung acolytes.  A 1952 attempt to haul him before a Senate investigative committee and get to the bottom of his operation ended with the cagey old gentleman leaving the senators outwitted and baffled.

A farm near Racine, Wisconsin is the only remaining university facility, although a tiny handful of churches may yet survive in places such as Wichita, Kansas.

He has been described as the &quot;[[Leonardo da Vinci]] of kooks&quot;.

== Important events ==
Prof. [[John_Vincent_Atanasoff | John V. Atanasoff]] and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, are now credited with the creation of the first true electronic digital computer in the basement of the physics department during the years 1937-1942. The Atanasoff/Berry computer used binary arithmetic circuits, regenerative memory, and logic circuits. These seminal ideas were communicated by Atanasoff to John Mauchly during a visit to Iowa State in the 1940s who then used them in the design of the better-known ENIAC built some years later.

Ames has been selected to host the first National Special Olympics in 2006 (summer).  Ames has regularly hosted numerous statewide athletic events such as the Iowa Games and Iowa Shrine Bowl.

Ada Hayden Heritage Park opened in summer of 2004. It lies west of [[US 69]] just north of Ames. It is a large park complex featuring two connected lakes (former quarries) and walking/biking trails.

'''Abalone''' is the [[American English]] variant of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name ''Abulón'' used  for various species of [[shellfish]] ([[mollusk]]s) from the [[Haliotidae]] family ([[genus]] ''Haliotis'').  The abalones belong to the large class of gastropods ([[Gastropoda]]).  There is only one genus in the family Haliotidae, and about four to seven subgenera. The taxonomy is somewhat confused. The number of species range from about 100 to about 130 species (due to the occurrence of [[hybrid]]s), characterized by a richly coloured (on the inside&amp;mdash;the outside is rough and mostly brown) shell yielding [[mother-of-pearl]].  This is also commonly called ''ear-shell,'' in [[Guernsey]] ''ormer'' (Fr. ''ormier'', for ''oreille de mer''), ''perlemoen'' in [[South Africa]] and ''pāua'' in [[New Zealand]]. Abalone is also prevalent in [[Australia]]n and [[South Africa]]n coastal waters and is highly valued. The meat of an abalone is also considered an expensive delicacy in certain parts of South-East and East Asia, especially in [[Japan]], although it has a high cholesterol content.

==Distribution and characteristics==
The Haliotid family has a worldwide distribution, along the coastal waters of every continent, except South America and the eastern coast of the USA. Most abalones are found off the Southern Hemisphere coasts of New Zealand, South Africa and Australia, and  Western North America and Japan in the Northern Hemisphere.

The family has unmistakable characteristics : the shell is rounded to oval, with two to three whorls, and the last one [[auriform]] (= grown into a large ‘ear’), giving rise to the common name ‘ear-shell’. The [[body whorl]] has a series of holes (four to ten depending on the species), near the anterior margin.

There is no [[Operculum (gastropod)|operculum]]. The back is convex, ranging from highly arched to very flattened. These shells cling solidly with their muscular foot to rocky surfaces at [[sublittoral]] depths. The color is very variable from species to species. The inside of the shell consists of iridiscent, silvery white to greenred [[mother-of-pearl]] through to ''Haliotis Iris'' which can comprise of; pinks and reds with predominant deep blues, greens and purples.

Abalones reach maturity at a small size. Their fertility is high and increases with size (from 10,000 to 11 million eggs at a time).

The larvae feed on plankton. The adults are herbivores and feed on macroalgae, preferring red algae. Sizes vary from 20 mm (''Haliotis pulcherrima'') to 200 mm (or even more) (''Haliotis rufescens'').

==Abalone diving in California==

Sport harvesting of Red Abalone is permitted with a California fishing license and an abalone stamp card. Abalone may only be taken while free diving (as opposed to scuba diving). Taking of abalone is not permited south of the mouth of the San Francisco Bay. There is a size minimum of seven inches measured across the shell and a quantity limit of three per day and 24 per year. Abalone may only be taken in season. Transportation of abalone may only legally occur while the abalone is still in the shell. Sale of sport obtained abalone is illegal (including the shell). Only Red Abalone may be taken; black, white, pink, and flat abalone are protected by law.

An abalone diver is normally equipped with a very thick wetsuit, including a hood, booties, and gloves. He or she would also wear a mask, snorkel, weight belt, abalone iron, and abalone gauge. It is common to dive for abalone in water six to 20+ feet deep. Abalone are normally found on rocks in kelp beds (they eat kelp). The abalone iron is used to pry the abalone from the rock before it can fully clamp down. Visibility is normally five to ten feet. Divers commonly dive out of boats, kayaks, tube floats, and directly off shore. An eight inch abalone is considered a good catch, nine inches extremely good, and a ten inch plus (250 mm) abalone would be a trophy catch. Rock picking is a separate method from diving where the rock picker feels underneath rocks at low tides for abalone.

There has been a trade in [[diving]] to catch abalones off parts of the USA coast from before 1939. In [[World War II]], many of these abalone divers were recruited into the USA [[armed forces]] and trained as [[frogman|frogmen]].

==Abalone diving in New Zealand==

[[Image:Abalone-farm1web.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Abalone farm]]

There is an extensive global [[black market]] in the collection and export of abalone meat. In New Zealand, where abalone is called '''pāua''' in the [[Māori language]], this can be a particularly awkward problem where the right to harvest pāua can be granted legally under [[Māori]] customary rights. When such permits to harvest are abused, it is frequently difficult to police. The legal recreational daily limit is 10 pāua per diver with a minimum shell length of 125 mm. The limit is strictly enforced by roving Ministry of Fisheries officers with the backing of the Police force. Pāua 'poaching' is a major industry in New Zealand with many thousands being taken illegally, often undersized. Convictions have resulted in seizure of diving gear, boats and motor vehicles as well as fines and in rare cases; imprisonment. The Ministry of Fisheries expects in the year 2004/05, nearly 1000 tons of pāua will be poached, with 75% of that being
undersized.[http://www.fish.govt.nz/information/corp-docs/soi-04-08/pau2-industry-association.pdf]

Highly polished [[New Zealand]] pāua shells are extremely popular as souvenirs with their striking blue, green and purple iridescence.  The [[muscle]] tissue of the [[mollusk]] is often eaten, and the [[gonad]]s of the abalone are delicacies in [[China]] and [[Japan]].

==Ormers in the Channel Islands==

Ormers (''Haliotis tuberculata'') are considered a delicacy in the Channel Islands and are pursued with great alacrity by the locals.  Unfortunately, this has led to a dramatic depletion in numbers since the latter half of the 19th century, and 'ormering' is now strictly regulated in order to preserve stocks.  The gathering of ormers is now restricted to a number of 'ormering tides', from the [[January 1]] to [[April 30]], which occur on the full or new moon and two days following.  No ormers may be taken from the beach that are under 8 cm in shell length.  Diving is strictly prohibited.  Any breach of these laws is a criminal offence and can lead to a heavy fine.  The demand for ormers is such that they led to the world's first underwater arrest, when a Mr Kempthorne-Leigh of Guernsey was arrested by a police officer in full diving gear when illegally diving for ormers.

==Abalone shell==

In addition, material scientists at the [[University of California, San Diego]] are studying abalone's strong [[calcium carbonate]] tiled structure for insight into a new wave of bullet-proof [[body armor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''Abbess''' ([[Latin]] ''abbatissa,'' fem. form of ''abbas,'' [[abbot]]) is the female [[religious superior|superior]], or [[Mother Superior]], of an
[[abbey]] or [[abbey|convent]] of [[nun]]s.

The mode of election, position, rights and authority of an abbess correspond generally with those of an [[abbot]]. The office is elective, the choice being by the secret votes of the sisters from their own body.  The abbess is solemnly admitted to her office by [[episcopal]] [[benediction]], together with the 
conferring of a staff and pectoral cross, and holds for life, though liable to be deprived for misconduct.
The [[council of Trent]] fixed the qualifying age at forty, with eight years of profession.  Abbesses have a right to demand absolute obedience of their nuns, over whom they exercise discipline, extending even to the power of expulsion, subject, however, to the [[bishop]].  As a female an abbess is incapable of performing the spiritual functions of the priesthood belonging to an abbot.  She cannot ordain, confer the veil, nor excommunicate.  In England abbesses attended ecclesiastical councils, e.g. that of Becanfield in [[694]], where they signed before the [[presbyter]]s. 

By [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]] usage abbesses presided over joint-houses of monks and nuns.  This custom accompanied Celtic monastic missions to France and Spain, and even to Rome itself.  At a later period, A.D. [[1115]], Robert, the founder of [[Fontevraud Abbey]] near [[Chinon]] and [[Saumur]], [[France]] committed the government of the whole order, men as well as women, to a female superior. 

In the German Evangelical church the title of abbess (''Äbtissin'') has in some cases--e.g. Itzehoe--survived to designate the heads of abbeys which since the Protestant [[Reformation]] have continued as ''Stifte,'' i.e. collegiate foundations, which provide a home and an income for unmarried ladies, generally of noble birth, called canonesses (''Kanonissinen'') or more usually ''Stiftsdamen.'' This office of abbess is of considerable social dignity, and was sometimes filled by princesses of the reigning houses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The human abdomen (from the [[Latin]] word meaning &quot;belly&quot;) is the part of the body between the [[pelvis]] and the [[thorax]]. Anatomically, the abdomen stretches from the thorax at the [[thoracic diaphragm]] to the pelvis at the [[pelvic brim]]. The '''pelvic brim''' stretches from the [[lumbosacral angle]] (the [[intervertebral disk]] between L5 and S1) to the [[pubic symphysis]] and is the edge of the [[pelvic inlet]]. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the [[abdominal cavity]]. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear.

Functionally, the human abdomen is where most of the [[alimentary tract]] is placed and so most of the absorption and digestion of food occurs here. The alimentary tract in the abdomen consists of the lower [[oesophagus]], the [[stomach]], the [[duodenum]], the [[jejunum]], [[ileum]], the [[cecum]] and the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], the [[ascending colon|ascending]], [[transverse colon|transverse]] and [[descending colon|descending colons]], the [[sigmoid colon]] and the [[rectum]]. Other vital organs inside the abdomen include the [[liver]], the [[kidneys]], the [[pancreas]] and the [[spleen]]. 

The '''abdominal wall''' is split into the posterior (back), lateral (sides) and anterior (front) walls. There is a common set of layers covering and forming all the walls: the deepest being the [[extraperitoneal fat]], the [[parietal peritoneum]], and a layer of [[fascia]] which has different names over where it covers (eg transversalis, psoas fascia). Superficial to these, but ''not'' present in the posterior wall are the three layers of muscle, the [[transversus abdominus]] (tranvserse abdominal muscle), the [[internal oblique|internal]] (obliquus internus) and the [[external oblique]] (obliquus externus).

==Muscles of the abdominal wall==
[[Image:Grays_Anatomy_image392.png|thumb|RIGHT|200px|''Henry Gray (1825–1861).  Anatomy of the Human Body.'']] 
The obliquus externus ([[external oblique muscle|external oblique]]) [[muscle]] is the outermost muscle covering the side of the abdomen. It is broad, flat, and irregularly quadrilateral. It originates on the lower eight [[rib]]s, and then curves down and forward towards its insertion on the outer anterior crest of the [[Ilium (disambiguation)|ilium]] and (via the sheath of the [[rectus abdominus]] muscle) the midline [[linea alba]].

The obliquus internus ([[internal oblique muscle|internal oblique]]) muscle is triangularly shaped and is smaller and thinner than the external oblique muscle that overlies it. It originates from [[Poupart's ligament]]/[[inguinal ligament]] and the inner anterior crest of the ilium. The lower two-thirds of it insert, in common with fibers of the external oblique and the underlying transversus abdominus, into the [[linea alba]].  The upper third inserts into the lower six ribs.  The transversus abdominus muscle is  flat and triangular, with its fibers running horizontally. It lies between the internal oblique and the underlying transversalis fascia.  It originates from Poupart's ligament, the inner lip of the ilium, the lumbar fascia and the inner surface of the [[cartilage]]s of the six lower ribs. It inserts into the linea alba behind the [[rectus abdominis]].

The [[rectus abdominis muscle]]s are long and flat. They originate at the [[pubic bone]], run up the abdomen on either side of the linea alba, and insert into the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs. The muscle is crossed by three [[tendon|tendinous]] intersections called the [[linae transversae]].  The rectus abdominus is enclosed in a thick sheath formed, as described above, by fibers from each of the three muscles of the lateral abdominal wall.

The [[pyramidalis muscle]] is small and triangular. It is located in the lower abdomen in front of the rectus abdominis. It originates at the pubic bone and is inserted into the linea alba half way up to the [[umbilicus]] (belly button).

== Abdominal organs ==
[[Image:Gray1120.png|thumb|RIGHT|200px|The relations of the viscera and large vessels of the abdomen.]] 
The abdomen contains most of the tubelike organs of the digestive tract, as well as several solid organs. Hollow abdominal organs include the [[stomach]], the [[small intestine]], and the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] with its attached [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]]. Organs such as the [[liver]], its attached [[gallbladder]], and the [[pancreas]] function in close association with the digestive tract and communicate with it via ducts. The [[spleen]], [[kidney]]s, and [[adrenal gland]]s also lie within the abdomen, along with many blood vessels including the [[aorta]] and [[venae cavae|inferior vena cava]]. Anatomists may consider the [[urinary bladder]], [[uterus]], [[fallopian tube]]s, and [[ovary|ovaries]] as either abdominal organs or as pelvic organs. Finally, the abdomen contains an extensive membrane called the [[peritoneum]]. A fold of peritoneum may completely cover certain organs, whereas it may cover only one side of organs that usually lie closer to the abdominal wall. Anatomists call the latter type of  organs ''retroperitoneal.''

== Surface landmarks of the abdomen ==

In the mid-line a slight furrow extends from the ensiform cartilage/[[xiphoid process]] above to the [[symphysis pubis]] below, representing the [[linea alba]] in the abdominal wall. At about its midpoint sits the umbilicus or navel.  On each side of it the broad recti muscles stand out in muscular people.  The outline of these muscles is interrupted by three or more transverse depressions indicating the [[lineae transversae]].  There is usually one about the [[ensiform cartilage]], one at the [[umbilicus]], and one between.  It is the combination of the linea alba and the linea transversae which form the abdominal &quot;six-pack&quot; sought by body builders.
 
The upper lateral limit of the abdomen is the subcostal margin formed by the cartilages of the false ribs (8, 9, 10) joining one another.  The lower lateral limit is the anterior 
crest of the [[ilium]] and [[Poupart's ligament]], which runs from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the [[pubis]].  These lower limits are marked by visible grooves.  Just above the pubic spines on either side are the external abdominal rings, which are openings in the muscular wall of the abdomen through which the [[spermatic cord]] emerges in the male, and through which an [[inguinal hernia]] may rupture.
 
One method by which the location of the abdominal contents can be appreciated is to draw three horizontal and two vertical lines.  The highest of the former is the [[transpyloric line]] of C. Addison, which is situated half-way between the [[suprasternal notch]] and the top of the symphysis pubis, and often cuts the pyloric opening of the stomach an inch to the right of the mid-line.  The [[hilum]] of each [[kidney]] is a little below it, while its left end approximately touches the lower limit of the [[spleen]].  It corresponds to the first lumbar vertebra behind.  The second line is the subcostal, drawn from the lowest point of the [[subcostal arch]] (tenth rib).  It corresponds to the upper part of the third lumbar vertebra, and it is an inch or so above the umbilicus. It indicates roughly the [[transverse colon]], the lower ends of the kidneys, and the upper limit of the transverse (3rd) part of the [[duodenum]].  The third line is called the intertubercular, and runs across between the two rough [[tubercle]]s, which can be felt on the outer lip of the crest of the ilium about two and a half inches (60 mm) from the anterior superior spine.  This line corresponds to the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and passes through or just above the [[ileo-caecal valve]], where the [[small intestine]] joins the [[large intestine|large]].  The two vertical or mid-Poupart lines are drawn from the point midway between the anterior superior spine and the pubic symphysis on each side, vertically upward to the costal margin.  The right one is the most valuable, as the [[ileo-caecal valve]] is situated where it cuts the intertubercular line. The orifice of the [[vermiform appendix]] lies an inch lower, at [[McBurney's point]].  In its upper part, the vertical line meets the transpyloric line at the lower margin of the ribs, usually the ninth, and here the [[gallbladder]] is situated.  The left mid-Poupart line corresponds in its upper three-quarters to the inner edge of the [[descending colon]].  The right subcostal margin corresponds to the lower limit of the [[liver]], while the right nipple is about half an inch above the upper limit of this [[viscus]].

These three horizontal and two vertical lines divide the abdomen into nine &quot;regions.&quot; These regions are: the left and right [[hypchondria]] the left and right lateral regions, the left and right [[inguinal]] regions, the [[epigastrium]], the umbilical region, and the pubic region.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term '''''abdominal surgery''''' broadly covers surgical procedures that involve opening the [[abdomen]].  Surgery of each abdominal organ is dealt with separately in connection with the description of that organ (see [[stomach]], [[kidney]], [[liver]], etc.) Diseases affecting the abdominal cavity are dealt with generally under their own names (e.g. [[appendicitis]]).  The three most common abdominal surgeries are described below. 

*Exploratory [[Laparotomy]] -- This refers to the opening of the [[abdominal cavity]] for direct examination of its contents, for example, to locate a source of bleeding or [[Physical trauma|trauma]]. It may or may not be followed by repair or removal of the primary problem. 

*[[Appendectomy]] -- Surgical opening of the abdominal cavity and removal of the [[vermiform appendix|appendix]].  Typically performed as definitive treatment for [[appendicitis]], although sometimes the appendix is prophylactically removed incidental to another abdominal procedure. 

*[[Laparoscopy]] -- A [[minimally invasive]] approach to abdominal surgery where rigid tubes are inserted through small incisions into the abdominal cavity. The tubes allow introduction of a small camera, surgical instruments, and gases into the cavity for direct or indirect visualization and treatment of the abdomen. The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to facilitate visualization and, often, a small video camera is used to show the procedure on a monitor in the operating room.  The surgeon manipulates instruments within the abdominal cavity to perform procedures such as cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal), the most common laparoscopic procedure.  The laparoscopic method speeds recovery time and reduces blood loss and infection as compared to the traditional &quot;open&quot; [[cholecystecomy]]. 

Complications of abdominal surgery include [[hemorrhage|bleeding]], [[infection]], [[shock]], and ileus (short-term paralysis of the bowel.) Sterile technique, [[aseptic]] post-operative care, [[antibiotics]], and vigilant post-operative [[monitoring]] greatly reduce the risk of these complications.  Planned surgery performed under sterile conditions is much less risky than that performed under emergency or unsterile conditions.  The contents of the bowel are unsterile, and thus leakage of bowel contents, as from [[trauma]], substantially increases the risk of infection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Arminianism}}
:''For the Armenian nationality, see [[Armenia]] or the [[Armenian language]].''
:''For the theological doctrines of [[Arius]], see [[Arianism]].''

'''Arminianism''' is a school of [[Soteriology|soteriological]] thought in [[Protestant]] [[Christian theology]] founded by the Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]. Its acceptence stretches through much of mainstream [[Protestantism]], particularly [[Evangelicalism]]. Due to the influence of [[John Wesley]], it is perhaps most prominent in the [[Methodism|Methodist movement]]. 

Arminianism is historically viewed as the primary opponent of [[Calvinism]]. Its main tenets hold that:
* All men are naturally unable to make any effort towards salvation
* God's election is conditional on faith in Jesus
* Jesus' atonement was potentially for all people
* God's grace does not act in a deterministic fashion 
* Salvation can be lost, as continued salvation is conditional upon continued faith

Within the broad scope of [[History of Christianity | church history]], Arminianism and Calvinism are closely related. Nonetheless, debates from respective followers are often so heated and public that direct references to both doctrines appear frequently in [[Culture of the United States | American culture]].

Arminianism is most accurately used to define those who affirm the original beliefs of Jacobus Arminius himself, but the term can also be understood as an umbrella for a larger grouping of ideas including those of [[Hugo Grotius]], [[John Wesley]], [[Clark Pinnock]], and others. There are two primary perspectives on how the system is applied in detail: Classical Arminianism, which sees Arminius as its figurehead, and Wesleyan Arminianism, which (as the name suggests) sees John Wesley as its figurehead. Wesleyan Arminianism is sometimes synonomous with Methodism. Additionally, Arminianism is understood by its critics to also include [[Pelagianism]], though supporters from both primary perspectives deny this vehemently.

==History==
:''Main artcle: [[History of Calvinist-Arminian Debate]]''

Jacobus Arminius was a Dutch pastor and theologian in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He was taught by Theodore Beza, Calvin's hand-picked successor, but he rejected his teacher's theology as making God the author of sin. Instead Arminius proposed that the election of God was ''of believers'', thereby making it [[Conditional election | conditional on faith]]. Arminius's views were challenged by the Dutch Calvinists, but Arminius died before a national synod could occur.

Arminius followers, not wanting to adopt their leader's name, called themselves the [[Remonstrants]]. When Arminius died before he could satisfy Holland's State General's request for a 14-page paper outlining his views, the Remonstrants replied in his stead crafting the [[Five articles of Remonstrance]]. After some political manuevering, the Dutch Calvinists were able to convince [[Maurice de Nassau | Prince Maurice of Nassau]] deal with the situation. Maurice systematically removed Arminian magistrates from office and called a national synod at Dordrecht. This [[Synod of Dort]] was open primarily to Dutch Calvinists (Arminians were excluded) with token Calvinist representatives from other countries, and in 1618 published a condemnation of Arminius and his followers as heretics. Part of this publication was the famous [[Five points of Calvinism]] in response to the five articles of Remonstrance.

Arminians across Holland were removed from office, imprisoned, banished, and sworn to silence. Twelve years later Holland officially granted Arminianism protection as a religion, although animosity between Arminians and Calvinists continued.

The debate between Calvin's followers and Arminius' followers is distinctive of post-Reformation church history. The heated discussions between friends and fellow [[Methodist]] ministers [[John Wesley]] and [[George Whitfield]] were characteristic of many similar debates. Wesley was a champion of Arminius' teachings, defending his [[soteriology]] in a periodical titled ''The Arminian'' and writing articles such as ''Predestination Calmly Considered''. He defended Arminius against charges of [[semi-Pelagianism]], holding strongly to beliefs in original sin and total depravity. At the same time, Wesley attacked the [[determinism]] that he claimed characterized unconditional election and maintained a belief in the [[Conditional Preservation of the Saints | ability to lose salvation]]. Wesley also clarified the doctrine of [[prevenient grace]] and preached the ability of Christians to attain to [[Christian perfection | perfection]].

==Current landscape==
Advocates of both Arminianism and Calvinism find a home in many Protestant denominations. Denominations leaning in the Arminian direction include Anglicans, [[Methodism | Methodists]], General Baptists, Pentecostals, and Charismatics. Denominations leaning in the Calvinist direction include Particular Baptists, Reformed Baptists, Presbyterians, and Congregationalists. The majority of [[Southern Baptists]], including [[Billy Graham]], accept Arminianism with an exception allowing for [[Perseverance of the saints | perseverance of the saints]]{{Ref|1-BFM}}, {{Ref|2-Harmon}}, {{Ref|3-Walls}} although many see Calvinism as growing in acceptance.{{Ref|4-Walls}} The majority of [[Lutherans]] hold to a mediating view taught by [[Philip Melanchthon]]. 

The current scholarly support for Arminianism is wide and varied. One particular thrust is a return to the teachings of Arminius - a system termed ''Classical'' Arminianism by F. Leroy Forlines (author of ''The Quest for Truth: Answering Life's Inescapable Questions''). Stephen Ashby (professor at Ball State University and contributor to ''Four Views on Eternal Security'') and Robert Picirilli (pastor, former academic dean and professor at Free Will Baptist Bible College, and author of ''Grace, Faith, and Free Will'') are two of the more prominent supporters. Through [[Methodism]], Wesley's teachings also inspire a large scholarly following, with vocal proponents including [[J. Kenneth Grider]], [[Stanley Hauerwas]], and [[William Willimon]]. 

Recent influence of the [[New Perspective on Paul]] movement has also strongly influenced Arminianism - primarily through a view of corporate election. Proponents of this movement include [[James Dunn (theologian) | James Dunn]] and [[Tom Wright (theologian) | N.T. Wright]]. Other Arminian theologians holding similar perspectives but not directly aligned with the New perspectives movement include Robert Shank (author of 'Elect in the Son'), [[David Pawson]] (British teacher/theologian and author of ''Once Saved, Always Saved?''), Paul Marston and Roger Forster (co-authors of ''God's Strategy in Human History''), Jerry Walls and Joseph Dongell (professors at [[Asbury Theological Seminary]] and co-authors of ''Why I Am Not a Calvinist'').

==Theology==
Arminian theology usually falls into one of two groups - Classical Arminianism, drawn from the teaching of Jacobus Arminius - and Wesleyan Arminian, drawing primarily from Wesley. Both groups overlap substantially. In addition, 

===Classical Arminianism===
[[Image:Arminius.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Portrait of [[Jacobus Arminius]].]]
Classical Arminianism (sometimes titled Reformed Arminianism or Reformation Arminianism) is the theological system that was presented by [[Jacobus Arminius]] and maintained by the [[Remonstrants]]{{ref|5-Ashby}}; its influence serves as the foundation for all Arminian systems. A list of beliefs is given below:

*'''Depravity is [[Total depravity | total]]''': Arminius states &quot;In this [fallen] state, the free will of man towards the true good is not only wounded, infirm, bent, and weakend; but it is also imprisoned, destroyed, and lost. And its powers are not only debilitated and useless unless they be assisted by grace, but it has no powers whatever except such as are excited by Divine grace.&quot;{{ref|6-Arminius}}

*'''Atonement is intended [[Unlimited atonement | for all]]''': Jesus' death was for all people, Jesus draws all people to himself, and all people have opportunity for salvation through faith.{{ref|7-Arminius}}

*'''Jesus' death [[Atonement (Satisfaction view) | satisfies]] God's justice''': The penalty for the sins of the elect are paid in full through Jesus' work on the cross. Thus Christ's atonement is intended for all, but requires faith to be effected. Arminius states &quot;Justification, when used for the act of a Judge, is either purely the imputation of righteoussness through mercy...or that man is justified before God...according to the rigour of justice without any forgiveness.&quot;{{ref|8-Arminius}} Stephen Ashby clarifies &quot;Arminius allowed for only two possible ways in which the sinner might be justified: (1) by our absolute and perfect adherence to the law, or (2) purely by God's imputation of Christ's righteousness.&quot;{{ref|9-Ashby}}

*'''Grace is resistible''': God takes initiative in the salvation process and His grace comes to all people. This grace (often called ''[[Prevenient Grace | prevenient]]'' or pre-regenerating grace) acts on all people to convict them of the Gospel, draw them strongly towards salvation, and enable the possibility of sincere faith. Picrilli states &quot;indeed this grace is so close to regeneration that it inevitably leads to regeneration unless finally resisted.&quot; {{ref|10-Picirilli}} The offer of salvation through grace does not act irresistably in a purely cause-effect, deterministic method but rather in an influence-and-response fashion that can be both freely accepted and freely denied.{{ref|11-Forlines}}

*'''Man has free will to respond or resist''': Free will is limited by God's sovereignty, but God sovereignly allows all men the choice to accept the Gospel of Jesus through faith, simultaneously allowing all men to resist.

*'''Election is [[Conditional election | conditional]]''': Arminius defined ''election'' as &quot;the decree of God by which, of Himself, from eternity, He decreed to justify in Christ, believers, and to accept them unto eternal life.&quot;{{ref|12-Arminius}} God alone determines who will be saved and his determination is that all who believe Jesus through faith will be justified. According to Arminius, &quot;God regards no one in Christ unless they are engrafted in him by faith.&quot;{{ref|13-Arminius}}

*'''God predestines the elect to a glorious future''': Predestination is not the predetermination of who will believe, but rather the predetermination of the believer's future inheritance. The elect are therefore predestined to sonship through adoption, glorification, and eternal life.{{ref|14-Pawson}}

*'''Eternal security is also [[Conditional Preservation of the Saints | conditional]]''': All believers have full assurance of salvation with the condition that they remain in Christ. Salvation is conditioned on faith, therefore perseverance is also conditioned.{{ref|15-Picirilli}} Apostasy (turning from Christ) is only commited through a deliberate, willful rejection of Jesus and renouncement of belief.{{ref|16-Picirilli}}

The [[Five articles of Remonstrance]] that Arminius' followers formulated in 1610 state the above beliefs regarding (I) conditional election, (II) unlimited atonement, (III) total depravity, (IV) total depravity and resistable grace, and (V) possibility of apostasy. Note, however, that the five articles completely denied perseverance of the saints; Arminius, himself, said that &quot;I never taught that a true believer can...fall away from the faith...yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of Scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect; and those answers to them which I have been permitted to see, are not of such as kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding.&quot;{{Ref|17-Arminius}} 

The core beliefs of Jacobus Arminius and the Remonstrants are summarized as such by theologian Stephen Ashby:

:1. Prior to being ''drawn and enabled'', one is ''unable to believe...able only to resist.''&lt;br&gt;
:2. Having been ''drawn and enabled'', but prior to regeneration, one is ''able to believe...able also to resist.''&lt;br&gt;
:3. After one ''believes'', God then regenerates; one is ''able to continue believing...able also to resist.''&lt;br&gt;
:4. Upon ''resisting'' to the point of ''unbelief'', one is ''unable again to believe...able only to resist.''{{Ref|18-Ashby}}&lt;br&gt;

===Wesleyan Arminianism===
:''See also: [[Methodism]]''
Apart from Arminius himself, John Wesley has historically been the strongest proponent of Arminianism. Wesley thoroughly agreed with the vast majority of what Arminius taught, maintaining strong doctrines of original sin, total depravity, conditional election, prevenient grace, unlimited atonement, and possibly apostasy.
[[Image:John_Wesley.jpg|thumbnail|350px|right|Portrait of [[John Wesley]].]]
Wesley departs from tradition and forges into new theological territory on three issues primarily.
* '''Atonement''' - Wesley's atonement is a hybrid of the [[Atonement (Satisfaction view) | penal substitution theory]] and [[Hugo Grotius]]' (a lawyer and one of the Remonstrants) [[Atonement (Governmental view) | governmental theory]]. Steven Harper states &quot;Wesley does not place the substitionary element primarily within a legal framework...rather it is the need to bring into proper relationship the 'justice' between God's love for persons and God's hatred of sin...it is not the satisfaction of a legal demand for justice so much as it is an act of mediated reconciliation.&quot; {{ref|19-Harper}} 
* '''Possibility of apostasy''' - Wesley fully acknowledges the possibility that Christians could apostasize and lose their salvation. Wesley's sermon ''A call to backsliders'' is one of his more influential sermons, and Harper summarizes as follows: &quot;the act of committing sin is not in itself ground for the loss of salvation...the loss of salvation is much more related to experiences that are profound and prolonged. Wesley sees two primary pathways that could result in a permanent fall from grace: unconfessed sin and the actual expression of apostasy.&quot; {{Ref|20-Harper}} Wesley disagrees with Arminius, however, in maintaining that apostasy was not final; Wesley himself, when talking about those who have made &quot;shipwrecks&quot; of their faith (1 Tim 1:19), claims that &quot;not one, or a hundred only, but I am persuaded, several thousands...Innumerable are the instances of this kind, of those who had fallen but now stand upright.&quot;{{Ref|21-Wesley}}
* '''[[Christian perfection]]''' - Christian perfection, according to Wesley, is “purity of intention, dedicating all the life to God” and “the mind which was in Christ, enabling us to walk as Christ walked.” It is “loving God with all our heart, and our neighbor as ourselves”. {{ref|22-Wesley}} It is 'a restoration not only to the favour, but likewise to the image of God,” our “being filled with the fullness of God&quot;.{{ref|23-Wesley}} Wesley was clear that Christian perfection did not imply perfection of bodily health or an infallibility of judgment. It also does not mean we no longer violate the will of God, for involuntary transgressions remain. Perfected Christians remain subject to temptation, and have continued need to pray for forgiveness and holiness. It is not an absolute perfection but a perfection in love. Furthermore, Wesley did not teach a salvation by perfection, but rather says that, &quot;Even perfect holiness is acceptable to God only through Jesus Christ.&quot;{{Ref|24-Wesley}}

===Other variations===

Since the time of Arminius, his name has come to represent a very large variety of beliefs. Some of these beliefs, such as Pelagianism (see [[Arminianism#Pelagianism | below]]) are not considered to be within Arminianism orthodoxy and are dealt with elsewhere. Some doctrines, however, do adhere to the Arminian foundation and, while minority views, are highlighted below.

====Open theism====
:''Main article: [[Open theism]]''

The doctrine of open theism states that God is not all-powerful, all-knowing, all-present, but is rather ''most''-powerful, ''most''-knowing, ''most''-present. As such, open theists resolve the issue of human free will and God's sovereignty by claiming that God is not logically capable of predetermining human choices - salvation or otherwise. [[Clark Pinnock]] is one of the most well-known propenents.

Some Arminians, such as professor and theologian Robert Picirilli, reject the doctrine of open theism as a &quot;deformed Arminianism&quot;.{{Ref|25-Picirilli}} Joseph Dongell stated that &quot;open theism actually moves beyond classical Arminianism towards process theology.&quot;{{Ref|26-Dongell}} The majority Arminian view accepts [[Classical Theism | classical theism]] - the belief that God's power, knowledge, and presence have no limits outside of His divine character. Most Arminians reconcile human free will with God's sovereignty and foreknowledge by holding three points:
* Human free will is limited by original sin, though God's [[prevenient grace]] restores to humanity the ability to accept God's call of salvation.{{ref|27-Picirilli}}
* God purposely exercises his sovereignty in ways that do not illustrate its extent - in other words, He has the power and authority to predetermine salvation but he chooses to apply it through different means.{{ref|28-Ashby}}
* God's foreknowledge of the future is exhaustive and complete, and therefore the future is certain and not contingent on human action. God does not determine the future, but He does know it. God's certainty and human contingency are compatible.{{ref|29-Picirilli}}

====Corporate view of election====
:''See also: [[Conditional election]]''

The majority Arminian view is that election is individual and based on God's foreknowledge of faith, but a second perspective  deserves merit. These Arminians reject the concept of individual election entirely, prefering to understand the doctrine in corporate terms. According to this corporate election, God never chose individuals to elect to salvation, but rather He chose to elect the believing Church to salvation. Dutch Reformed theologian Herman Ridderbos says &quot;[The certainty of salvation] does not rest on the fact that the church belongs to a certain &quot;number&quot;, but that it belongs to Christ, from before the foundation of the world. Fixity does not lie in a hidden decree, therefore, but in corporate unity of the Church with Christ, whom it has come to know in the gospel and has learned to embrace in faith.&quot;{{ref|30-Ridderbos}}

Corporate election draws support from a similar concept of corporate election found in the Old Testament and Jewish law. Indeed most Biblical scholarship is in agreement that Judeo-Greco-Roman thought in the 1st century was opposite of the Western world's &quot;individual first&quot; mantra - it was very collectivist in nature.{{ref|31-Abasciano}} Identity stemmed from membership in a group more than individuality.{{ref|32-Abasciano}} According to Romans 9-11, supporters claim, Jewish election as the chosen people ceased with their national rejection of Jesus as Messiah. As a result of the new covenant, God's chosen people are now the corporate body of Christ, the church (sometimes called ''spiritual Israel'' - see also [[Covenant theology]]). Pastor and theologian Dr. Brian Abasciano claims &quot;What Paul says about Jews, Gentiles, and Christians, whether of their place in God’s plan, or their election, or their salvation, or how they should think or behave, he says from a corporate perspective which views the group as primary and those he speaks about as embedded in the group. These individuals act as members of the group to which they belong, and what happens to them happens by virtue of their membership in the group.&quot;{{ref|33-Abasciano}}

These scholars also maintain that Jesus was the only human ever elected and that individuals must be &quot;in Christ&quot; (Eph 1:3-4) through faith to be part of the elect. Joseph Dongell, professor at Asbury Theological Seminary, states &quot;the most conscipuous feature of Ephesians 1:3-2:10 is the phrase 'in Christ', which occurs twelve times in Ephesians 1:3-4 alone...this means that Jesus Christ himself is the chosen one, the predestined one. Whenever one is incorporated into him by grace through faith, one comes to share in Jesus' special status as chosen of God.&quot;{{ref|34-Dongell}} Markus Barth illustrates the inter-connectedness: &quot;Election in Christ must be understood as the election of God's people. Only as members of that community do individuals share in the benefits of God's gracious choice.&quot;{{ref|35-Barth}}

==Comparison to other views==
Understanding Arminianism is aided by understanding the theological alternatives - Pelagianism and Calvinism. Arminianism, like any major belief system, is frequently misunderstood both by critics and would-be supporters. Listed below are a few common misconceptions.

===Common misconceptions===
* '''Arminianism supports works-based salvation''' - No well-known system of Arminianism denies salvation &quot;by faith alone&quot; and &quot;by faith first to last&quot;. This misconception is often directed at the Arminian possibility of apostasy, which critics maintain requires continual good works to achieve final salvation. To Arminians, however, both intial salvation ''and'' eternal security are &quot;by faith alone&quot;; hence &quot;by faith first ''to last''&quot;. Belief through faith is the condition for entrance into the Kingdom of God; unbelief is the condition for exit from the Kingdom of God - not a lack of good works.{{ref|36-Pawson}} {{ref|37-Picirilli}} {{ref|38-Ashby}}
* '''Arminianism denies original sin and total depravity''' - No system of Arminianism founded on Arminius or Wesley denies original sin or total depravity;{{ref|39-Ashby}} both Arminius and Wesley ''strongly'' affirmed that man's basic condition is one in which he cannot be righteous, understand God, or seek God.{{ref|40-Arminius}} See the comparison to Calvinism below for where the two systems diverge.
* '''Arminianism denies Jesus' substitutionary payment for sins''' - Both Arminius and Wesley believed in the necessity and sufficiency of Christ's atonement through substitution.{{ref|41-Picirilli}} Arminius held that God's justice was satisfied [[Atonement (Satisfaction view) | individually]]{{ref|42-Ashby}} while Hugo Grotius and many of Wesley's followers taught that it was satisfied [[Atonement (Governmental view) | corporately]].{{ref|43-Picirilli}}

===Comparison to Pelagianism===
:''Main article: [[Pelagianism]]. See also: [[Semi-Pelagianism]], and [[History of Calvinist-Arminian Debate]]''

[[Pelagius]] was a British monk and opponent of [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[St. Jerome | Jerome]] in the early 5th Century AD. When he arrived in Christian Rome from Britain, Pelagius was appalled at the lack of holiness he found. Pelagius preached justification through faith alone, but also believed salvation was finished through good works and moral uprightness. Furthermore, Pelagius completely denied the [[Predestination | double predestination]] and [[irresistible grace]] affirmed by Augustine. Several of his students - notably [[Caelestius]] - went further than their teacher and rejected justification by faith.

Through the influence of Augustine and Jerome, the teachings of Pelagius and Caelestius were rejected by the Papacy as heretical. Historically [[Pelagianism]] has come to to represent any system that denies original sin, holds that by nature humans are capable of good, and maintains morality and works are part of the equation that yields salvation. [[Semi-Pelagianism]] is a variation on the original more akin to Pelagius' own thought - that justification is through faith, but that Adam's original sin was merely a bad example, humans can naturally seek God, and salvation is completed through works. Both systems reject a Calvinist understanding of predestination.

Many critics of Arminianism, both historically and currently, claim that Arminianism condones, accepts, or even explicitly supports Pelagianism of either variety. Arminius refered to Pelagianism as &quot;the grand falsehood&quot; and stated that he &quot;must confess that I detest, from my heart, the consequences [of that theology].&quot;{{ref|44-Arminius}} David Pawson, a British pastor/theologian, decries this association as &quot;libelous&quot; when attributed to Arminius' or Wesley's doctrine.{{ref|45-Pawson}} Indeed most Arminians reject all accusations of Pelagianism; nonetheless, partially due to Calvinist opponents,{{ref|46-Pawson}} {{ref|47-Picirilli}} the two terms remain intertwined in popular usage. Listed below are similarities and contrasts between Arminianism and Pelagianism.

:'''Similarities:''' Both systems reject doctrines of Calvinistic predestination and irresistible grace. Both systems accept the Biblical importance of works, morality, and striving to become more holy.

:'''Differences:''' Arminianism maintains original sin, total depravity, substitutionary atonement, and salvation through faith alone. Arminianism maintains that works and holiness, while important, have no determining effect on salvation at any point in the process.

===Comparison to Calvinism===
{{Methodism}}
:''Main article: [[Calvinism]]''
Ever since Arminius and his followers revolted against Calvinism in the early 17th century, soteriology has been largely divided between Calvinism and Arminianism. On the conservative side of Calvinism is [[Hyper-Calvinism]] and on the liberal side of Arminianism is [[Pelagianism]], but the overwhelming majority of [[Protestantism | Protestant]], [[Evangelicalism | evangelical]] pastors and theologians hold to one of these two systems or somewhere in between. 

====Similarities====
*'''[[Total depravity]]''' - Arminians affirm with Calvinists the doctrine of total depravity. The differences come in the understanding of how God remedies this depravity.

*'''[[Substitutionary_atonement | Substitutionary effect of atonement]]''' - Arminians also affirm with Calvinists the substitutionary effect of Christ's atonement and that this effect is limited only to the elect. Classical Arminians would agree with Calvinists that this substitution was an individual [[Atonement (Satisfaction view) | penal satisfaction]] for all of the elect, while most Wesleyan Arminians would maintain that the substitution was corporate and [[Atonement (Governmental view) | governmental]] in nature.

====Differences====
* '''Extent of Atonement''' - Arminians hold to a universal drawing and [[Unlimited atonement | universal extent of atonement]] instead of the specific drawing and [[limited atonement | limited extent]] held by Calvinism. Ashby states:
::&quot;God could have sovereignly chosen to remedy humanity's situation differently than by the particularistic, cause-and-effect means proposed by Calvinism. In other words, when God saw his fallen human race in as bad a condition as it could possibly be in -'' 'dead in sins' ''and'' 'unable to do the least spiritual good' ''- logically, nothing would have precluded him from sovereignly choosing to reach out to all people with enabling grace (often referred to as prevenient grace). In fact, the Apostle Paul says that 'the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men' (Titus 2:11)&quot;{{ref|48-Ashby}}

* '''Nature of Grace''' - Arminians believe that through God's [[prevenient grace]], he restores free will concerning salvation to all humanity. Individuals, therefore, are able either to accept the Gospel call through faith or resist it through unbelief. Calvinists hold that an individual's response to the Gospel call is determined by God, not man; thus God's grace is [[Irresistible grace | irresistible]]. Ashby continues:
::&quot;The Calvinist recoils and says, 'if all are enabled and all are drawn, then universalism must surely result - all would be saved.' To which I would say, 'Yes, ''if'' God's grace were irresistable grace.' Once again, however, God can sovereignly choose that his salvation is not going to proceed along the lines of a deterministic, cause-and-effect relationship. Rather, he is going to allow the sinner to resist the offer of grace, which grace he has sovereignly enabled the sinner to accept.&quot; {{ref|49-Ashby}}

* '''Conditionality of Election''' - Arminians hold that election to eternal salvation comes through (within) Jesus and therefore has the [[Conditional election| condition of faith]] attached. The Calvinist doctrine of [[unconditional election]] states that salvation cannot be earned and therefore has no human conditions - faith is not a condition, but rather a means. Jerry Dongell uses an illustration of a terrorist prison camp, with the sinner securely tied, blindfolded, gagged, and drugged and contrasts the two versions of Divine rescue offered:
::&quot;The Calvinist view of the divine invasion is simple. God invades the camp, carries the prisoner out, strips the prisoner of her shackles and blinders, and injects &quot;faith&quot; into the prisoner's veins. The former prisoner, having already been rescued from prison and positioned outside the walls, now trusts the Deliverer because of the potency of the administered faith serum. God has been the lone actor throughout, in the sense that the human response of faith is directly and irresistibly caused by God...

::&quot;The classical Arminian believes that God steals into the prison and makes it to the bedside of the victim. God injects a serum that begins to clear the prisoner's mind of delusions and quell her hostile reactions. God removes the gag from the prisoner's mouth and shines a flashlight around the pitch-black room. The prisoner remains mute as the Rescuer's voice whispers &quot;Do you know where you are? Let me tell you! Do you know who you are? Let me show you!&quot; And the wooing begins, divine truth begins to dawn on the prisoner's heart and mind; the Savior holds up a small mirror to show the prisoner her sunken eyes and frail body. &quot;Do you see what they've done to you, and do you see how you've given yourself to them?&quot; Even in the dim light, the prisoner's weakened eyes are beginning to focus. The rescuer continues &quot;Do you know who I am, and that I want you for myself?&quot; Perhaps the prisoner makes no obvious advance but does not turn away. The questions keep coming: &quot;Can I show you pictues of who you once were and the wondrous plans I have for you in the years to come?&quot; The prisoner's heartbeat quickens as the Savior presses on: &quot;I know that part of you suspects that I have come to harm you. But let me show you something - my hands, they're a bit bloody. I crawled through the awful tangle of barbed wire to get you.&quot; Now here in this newly created sacred space, in this moment of new possibility, the Savior whispers &quot;I want to carry you out of here right now! Give me your heart! Trust me!&quot;{{ref|50-Dongell}}

* '''Perseverance''' - Arminians believe that future salvation and eternal life is secured in Christ and protected from all external forces, but is [[Conditional Preservation of the Saints | conditional on remaining in Christ]] and can be lost through apostasy. This conditional perseverance is in contrast to the doctrine of [[Perseverance of the Saints]] and concept of &quot;once saved, always saved&quot;. Pawson comments:
::&quot;The Arminian position is accurately portrayed by someone throwing a lifeline to a drowning man and saying 'grab hold of this and keep holding on tightly until I pull you to safety.' I would maintain that no one rescued in this way would dream that he had saved himself or even made a 'contribution' which merited his rescue. He would be filled with gratitude towards his rescuer.&quot;{{ref|51-Pawson}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Alan Parsons Project''' was a British [[progressive rock]] and pop group active between 1975 and 1987 founded by [[Alan Parsons]] and [[Eric Woolfson]]. 

Most of their titles, especially the early work, share common traits (likely influenced by [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[Dark Side of the Moon]]'', on which Parsons was the [[audio engineer]] in [[1973 in music|1973]]): they were [[concept album]]s, they tended to begin with an instrumental introduction which faded into the first song, often had an instrumental piece in the middle of the second [[gramophone record|LP]] side, and concluded with a quiet, sad, or powerful song. (The opening instrumental was largely done away with by 1980; no later Project album except &quot;Eye In The Sky&quot; featured one.)

The group was also unusual for its lack of a single lead vocalist. Lead vocal duties alternate between Woolfson (mostly for slow or sad songs) and a stream of guest vocalists chosen by their vocal style to complement each song. Woolfson sang lead on many of the group's hits (including &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Eye In The Sky&quot;) and the record company pressured Parsons to use him more, but Parsons preferred &quot;real&quot; singers, which Woolfson admitted he was not. In addition to Woolfson, Chris Rainbow, Lenny Zakatek, and Colin Blunstone made regular appearances. Other singers, such as Ambrosia's David Pack, Vitamin Z's Geoff Barradale, and Procol Harum's Gary Brooker, have recorded only once or twice with the Project. Parsons himself only sang lead on one song (&quot;The Raven&quot;) and can be heard singing backup on another (&quot;To One in Paradise&quot;). Both of those songs appeared on the group's first record, ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'', an album containing music based on the stories and poetry of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

Although the vocalists varied, a small number of musicians worked with the Alan Parsons Project regularly. They, and Parsons' production, are the reason listeners can instantly recognize a song as a Project work even with an unfamiliar singer. Andrew Powell (composer and arranger of orchestral music throughout the life of the Project), Ian Bairnson (guitar) and Richard Cottle (synthesizer and saxophone) were integral parts of the Project's sound. Powell is also notable for having composed a [[film score]] in the Project style for [[Richard Donner]]'s film ''[[Ladyhawke]]''.

Behind the revolving lineup and the regular sidemen, the true core of the Project was the duo of Parsons and Woolfson. Eric Woolfson was a lawyer by profession, but is a classically-trained composer and pianist as well. Alan Parsons was a successful producer and accomplished engineer. Both worked together to craft noteworthy songs with impeccable fidelity, and almost all songs on Project albums are credited to &quot;Woolfson/Parsons.&quot;

== Members ==

==Trivia==
*In the [[Austin Powers]] movie ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me|The Spy who Shagged Me]]'', [[Dr. Evil]]'s laser was called &quot;The Alan Parsons Project,&quot; after the &quot;noted Cambridge physicist Dr. Parsons&quot;
*The project for developing a new site for the [[National Library for the Blind]] is officially called &quot;The Alan Parsons Project&quot;
*&quot;Sirius&quot;, the instrumental piece that opens ''Eye In The Sky,'' is popular in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] as background music during player introductions. It is perhaps best remembered as playing this role for all six [[Chicago Bulls]] championship teams of the 1990s. 
*&quot;Sirius&quot; and ''Eye In The Sky'''s other instrumental, &quot;Mammagamma&quot;, were used as music-under for a [[1987]] [[The Weather Channel|Weather Channel]] special on thunderstorms (this was far before the network engaged in regular non-live programming), alongside the music of [[Jean-Michel Jarre]].
* In [[The Simpsons]] episode 3F21 [[Homerpalooza]], Homer thought that The Alan Parsons Project was &quot;some sort of hovercraft&quot;.
* [[Grandaddy]]'s promo-only single &quot;[[Alan Parsons In A Winter Wonderland|Alan Parsons in a Winter Wonderland]]&quot; is a humourous cover of the Christmas song [[Winter Wonderland]], with lyrics altered to make the song about Alan Parsons.

== Discography ==
* [[1975 in music|1975]] ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' - based on stories by the writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. The later reissue on CD (in 1987) was remixed from the original master tapes, enhancing some of the tracks and restoring the [[Orson Welles]] narration (recorded a few weeks before his death) that was left off the original due to record company 'concerns'.
* [[1977 in music|1977]] ''[[I Robot (album)|I Robot]]'' - The title quotes [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[I, Robot|work]], &quot;a view of tomorrow through the eyes of today&quot;. Includes minor hits &quot;I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You&quot; and &quot;Breakdown.&quot;
* [[1978 in music|1978]] ''[[Pyramid (album)|Pyramid]]'' - [[Ancient Egypt]] surfaces repeatedly, the album is called &quot;a view of yesterday through the eyes of today&quot;.
* [[1979 in music|1979]] ''[[Eve (album)|Eve]]'' - about [[woman|women]]; this is the only Project album to feature female lead vocalists - and even then only on two tracks.
* [[1980 in music|1980]] ''[[The Turn of a Friendly Card]]'' - about [[gambling]], literally and figuratively. Includes their hits &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Games People Play.&quot;
* [[1982 in music|1982]] ''[[Eye in the Sky]]'' - presumably about surveillance, [[Life]] and the [[Universe]], but some insist it is about &quot;forgotten and lost values&quot;. Album contains their most famous single, &quot;Eye in the Sky.&quot; 
* [[1984 in music|1984]] ''[[Ammonia Avenue]]'' - although this album has no discernable theme, it is their most &quot;radio-friendly&quot; album. Includes &quot;Don't Answer Me&quot; and &quot;You Don't Believe&quot; (the latter first appeared on a 1983 &quot;best of&quot; collection).
* [[1984 in music|1984]] ''[[Vulture Culture]]'' - a critique of consumerism and, in particular, American popular culture. Includes &quot;Let's Talk About Me.&quot;
* [[1985 in music|1985]] ''[[Stereotomy]]'' - The effect of fame and fortune on various people - singers, actors, etc.
* [[1987 in music|1987]] ''[[Gaudi (album)|Gaudi]]'' - songs inspired by the life of Catalan architect [[Antoni Gaudí]], with a song named after his most famous work, [[Sagrada familia|La Sagrada Familia]].

After those albums, Parsons released other titles under his name (''[[Try Anything Once]]'', ''[[On Air]]'', ''[[The Time Machine (album)|The Time Machine]]'', and ''[[A Valid Path]]''), while Woolfson made [[concept albums]] named ''Freudiana'' (about [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work on [[psychology]]) and ''[[Poe - More Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' (continuing from the Alan Parsons Project's first album about [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s literature).

Although the studio version of ''Freudiana'' was produced by Alan Parsons (and featured the regular Project backing musicians, making it an 'unofficial' Project album), it was primarily Eric Woolfson's idea to turn it into a musical. This eventually led to a rift between the two artists. While Alan Parsons pursued his own solo career and took many members of the Project on the road for the first time in a successful worldwide tour, Eric Woolfson went on to produce musical plays influenced by the Project's music. ''Freudiana'', ''Gaudi'' and ''Gambler'' were three musicals that included some Project songs like &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Inside Looking Out,&quot; and &quot;Limelight.&quot; The live music from ''Gambler'' was only distributed at the performance site (in [[Cologne]], Germany).

A collection called ''The Instrumental Works'' (1990; now out of print) includes many of the Project's instrumental tracks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alan Parsons''' (born [[December 20]], [[1949]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] musician.

He began his musical career as a staff engineer at EMI Studios, and first garnered significant industry exposure via his work on the [[Beatles]]' 1969 masterpiece ''[[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]]''. Parsons subsequently worked with [[Paul McCartney]] on several of [[Wings (band)|Wings]]' earliest albums; he also oversaw recordings from [[Al Stewart]], [[Cockney Rebel]], [[Pilot]], [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]], and the [[Hollies]], but solidified his reputation by working on [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[Dark Side of the Moon]]''.

Alan Parsons was known for going beyond what one would consider the normal scope of a recording engineer. He considered himself to be a recording [[Film director|director]] and was known to compare what he did with albums to what [[Stanley Kubrick]] did on film. This is obvious in his work with Al Stewart's &quot;[[Year of the Cat]]&quot;, where Parsons added the [[saxophone]] part and transformed the original folk concept into the [[jazz]] influenced [[ballad]] that put Al Stewart onto the charts. It is also seen in Parson's influence on the Hollies &quot;[[He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Air That I Breathe]]&quot;, sharp departures from their 60s pop &quot;Stay&quot;, &quot;Just One Look&quot;, &quot;Stop, Stop, Stop&quot;, [[Bus Stop (song)|&quot;Bus Stop&quot;]], or [[Betty Everett|&quot;It's in His Kiss&quot;]].

Although an accomplished [[vocalist]] and [[flutist]], Parsons only sang infrequent and incidental parts on his albums. Recordings featuring his [[flute]] are virtually unknown.

Influenced by his work on Stewart's concept album ''[[Time Passages]]'', Parsons decided to begin creating his own thematic records; along with songwriter [[Eric Woolfson]], he soon founded [[The Alan Parsons Project]]. Although Parsons played keyboards and infrequently sang on his records, the Project was designed primarily as a forum for a revolving collection of vocalists and session players — among them [[Arthur Brown]], ex-Zombie [[Colin Blunstone]], [[Cockney Rebel]]'s [[Steve Harley]], the [[Hollies]]' [[Allan Clarke]] and guitarist [[Ian Bairnson]] — to interpret and perform Parsons and Woolfson's conceptually-linked, lushly-synthesized music.

The Project debuted in 1976 with ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'', a collection inspired by the work of [[Edgar Allen Poe]]. The album was remixed for release on CD and includes narration by [[Orson Wells]] which was left off the vinyl version. Similarly, the science fiction of [[Isaac Asimov]] served as the raw material for 1977's follow-up ''[[I Robot (album)|I Robot]]''. With 1980s ''[[The Turn of a Friendly Card]]'', a meditation on gambling, the [[Alan Parsons Project]] scored a Top 20 hit, &quot;[[Games People Play]]&quot;. 1982's ''[[Eye in the Sky]]'' was their most successful effort, and notched a Top Three hit with its title track. While 1984's ''[[Ammonia Avenue]]'' went gold, the Project's subsequent LPs earned little notice, although records like 1985's ''[[Vulture Culture]]'' and 1987's ''[[Gaudi]]'' found favor with longtime fans. 

Following the breakup of The Project, he went on to create several solo albums:

*[[1993]] ''[[Try Anything Once]]'',
*[[1996]] ''[[On Air]]'' - includes CD-ROM containing some history of [[aviation]],
*[[1999]] ''[[The Time Machine (album)|The Time Machine]]'',
*2004 ''[[A Valid Path]]'', with [[David Gilmour]] on &quot;Return to [[Tunguska]]&quot;.

      <comment>Note there are an infinite number of primes (to contrast with usage of &quot;all but finitely many&quot;)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the phrase '''almost all''' has a number of specialised uses.

&quot;Almost all&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;all but [[finite]]ly many&quot;; see [[almost]].

In [[number theory]], if ''P''(''n'') is a property of positive [[integer]]s, and if ''p''(''N'') denotes the number of positive integers ''n'' less than ''N'' for which ''P''(''n'') holds, and if 

:''p''(''N'')/''N'' &amp;rarr; 1 as ''N'' &amp;rarr; &amp;infin;

(see [[limit]]), then we say that &quot;''P''(''n'') holds for almost all positive integers ''n''&quot; and write
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall^\infty n) P(n)&lt;/math&gt;. 

For example, the [[prime number theorem]] states that the number of [[prime numbers]] less than or equal to ''N'' is asymptotically equal to ''N''/ln ''N''. Therefore the proportion of prime integers is roughly 1/ln ''N'', which tends to 0. Thus, ''almost all'' positive integers are composite, however there are still an infinite number of primes.

Occasionally, &quot;almost all&quot; is used in the sense of &quot;[[almost everywhere]]&quot; in [[measure theory]], or in the closely related sense of &quot;[[almost surely]]&quot; in [[probability theory]].

      <comment>ref. to otherwise ununderstandable &quot;Baum&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[1846]] [[Charles Babbage]] was invited to give a seminar at the [[University of Turin]] about his [[analytical engine]].
[[Federico Luigi, Conte Menabrea|Luigi Menabrea]], a young [[Italy|Italian]] [[engineer]] wrote up Babbage's lecture in [[French language|French]], and this transcript was subsequently published in the [[Bibliothèque Universelle de Genève]] in [[1842]].

Babbage asked  [[Ada Lovelace]] (born Ada Byron) to translate Menabrea's paper into English. He then further asked Lady Ada to augment the notes she had added to the translation, and she spent most of a year doing this.

These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in ''The Ladies Diary'' and ''Taylor's Scientific Memoirs'' (under the initialism A.A.L.).

Her notes were labelled A, B, C, D, E, F and G, the last one being the longest.

In note G Ada describes an [[algorithm]] for the [[analytical engine]] to compute [[Bernoulli number]]s. It is generally considered the first algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a [[computer]], and for this reason she is considered by many to be the first [[programmer|computer programmer]].

Note G could possibly also be said to be the first expression of the modern computer phrase &quot;[[Garbage In, Garbage Out]]&quot;.  Lovelace writes:

:''&quot;The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.''&quot;

On the other hand, proponents of [[Artificial intelligence]] would dismiss the above quote as nonsense: [[Automated theorem proving]] could be cited as a counterexample. 

According to Linda Talisman on
[http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/ada-lovelace-notes.html]:
&quot;Baum &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Baum, Joan. ''The Calculating Passion of Ada Byron''. Archon
Books, Hamden, Conn., 1986. ISBN 0208021191&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; cites:
*Perl, Teri. The Ladies Diary or Woman's Almanac, 1704-1841, Historica Mathematica 6 (1979): 36-53
*Wallis, Ruth and Peter. Female Philomaths, Historica Mathematica 7, (1980), 57-64
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There were indeed women in mid-century England who signed
their names to mathematical articles in popular journals,
and there were influential periodicals, such as the
[[Edinburgh Review]], that lent intellectual women psychological
support.... Although the [[Ladies Diary]] ..., the most popular
of the mathematical periodicals, encouraged women to join
wit with beauty, it attracted serious amateurs of both
sexes... [it] was a respectable place to pose mathematical
problems and sustain debate... since there were few science
periodicals in England until the 1830s, technical articles
often appeared in general periodicals like the Ladies Diary.
It may have been something similar that originally sparked
[[Mary Fairfax Somerville|Mrs. Somerville's]] interest in mathematics. At a tea party
one afternoon, she recalled years later, young Mary Fairfax
had been given a ladies' fashion magazine that contained a
puzzle, the answer to which was given in strange symbols.
These symbols turned out to be [[algebra]]. And that magazine
became her introduction to the world of [[Euclidean geometry]]
and number.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''aromatic hydrocarbon''' (abbreviated as AH),  or '''arene''' is a [[hydrocarbon]], the [[molecular structure]] of which incorporates one or more planar sets of six [[carbon]] atoms that are connected by [[delocalised electron]]s numbering the same as if they consisted of alternating single and double [[Covalent bond|covalent bonds]]. After the simplest possible [[aromatic]] hydrocarbon, [[benzene]], such a configuration of six carbon atoms is known as a [[benzene ring]].

== Benzene ring model ==
[[image:toluene.png|100px|right|thumb| [[Toluene]] ]]{{main|aromaticity}}
Each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share. One goes to the hydrogen atom, and one each to the two neighboring carbons. This leaves one to share with one of its two neighboring carbon atoms, which is why the benzene molecule is drawn with alternating single and double bonds around the hexagon.


Many chemists just draw a circle around the inside of the ring to show that there are six electrons floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself. This also accurately represents the equivalent nature of the six bonds all of [[bond order]] ~1.5. This equivalency is well explained by [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance form]]s. The electrons float above and below the ring, and the electromagnetic fields they generate keep the ring flat. 

In modern terminology, benzene rings can be described as compounds in which a continuous, closed system of rings contains separate sets of [[VSEPR#Sigma_Bonds|sigma]] and [[VSEPR#Pi_Bonds|pi electron]]s. 
The [[atomic orbital]]s forming the sigma system are sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[orbital hybridisation|hybridized]], and those forming the pi system are pure p orbitals. 

* Properties:
# They have close conjugation.
# The Carbon atoms are sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized, and therefore have a trigonal planar structure.
# The Carbon-Hydrogen ratio is very large.
# [[Hückel's rule]]s apply
# They burn with a sooty yellow flame because of the high carbon-hydrogen ratio.
# They undergo [[electrophilic substitution reaction]]s
 
== Benzene and derivatives of benzene ==
[[image:Benzene-structure.png|75px|right|thumb| [[Benzene]] ]]{{main|benzene}}
Aromatic hydrocarbons can be ''monocyclic'' or ''polycyclic''. [[Benzene]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, is the simplest AH and was recognized as the first aromatic hydrocarbon, with the nature of its bonding first being recognized by [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz]] in the [[19th century]].  

==PAHs==
{{main|Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}}
[[image:napthalene.png|100px|right|thumb| [[Naphthalene]] ]]Some important arenes are the '''polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons''' (PAH); they are also called '''polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons'''. They are  composed of more than one aromatic ring. The simplest PAH is [[benzocyclobutene]] ([[Carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;[[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).

== PAHs and the origins of life ==
{{main|PAH world hypothesis}}
In January 2004 (at the 203rd Meeting of the [[American Astronomical Society]]), it was reported (as cited in Battersby, 2004) that a team led by A. Witt of the [[University of Toledo|University of Toledo, Ohio]] studied ultraviolet light emitted by the [[Red Rectangle nebula]] and found the spectral signatures of [[anthracene]] and [[pyrene]]. (No other such complex molecules had ever before been found in space.) This discovery was considered confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond to each other in various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms.

Witt and his team inferred (as cited in Battersby, 2004) that since they discovered PAHs&amp;mdash;which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth&amp;mdash;in a nebula, nebulae, by necessity, are where they originate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about an '''abbey''' as a Christian [[monastery|monastic community]]. For other uses, see [[Abbey (disambiguation)]]''. 
{{christianity}}
An '''abbey''' (from the [[Latin]] ''abbatia,'' which is derived from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''abba,'' &quot;father&quot;), is a [[Christianity|Christian]] '''[[monastery]]''' or '''convent''', under the government of an [[Abbot]] or an [[Abbess]], who serve as the spiritual father or mother of the community. A '''[[priory]]''' only differed from an abbey in that the superior bore the title of [[prior]] instead of abbot. Priories were originally offshoots from the larger abbeys, to the abbots of which they continued subordinate; however, the actual distinction between abbeys and priories was lost by the [[Renaissance]]. Do not confuse the term ''convent'' with the term monastery.  Both nuns and monks live in monasteries.  Sisters, members of active orders, live in convents.  Nuns who are cloistered live in monasteries.

The earliest known Christian monastic communities (see [[Monasticism]])  consisted of groups of cells or huts collected about a common centre, which was usually the house of some hermit or anchorite famous for holiness or singular asceticism, but without any attempt at orderly arrangement. Such communities were not an invention of Christianity. The example had been already set in part by the [[Essenes]] in [[Judea]] and perhaps by the [[Therapeutae]] in [[Egypt]]. 

In the earliest age of Christian [[monasticism]] the [[ascetic]]s were accustomed to live singly, independent of one another,  not far from some village church, supporting themselves by the labour of their own hands, and distributing the surplus after the supply of their own scanty wants to the poor. Increasing religious fervour, aided by persecution, drove them farther and farther away from the civilization into mountain solitudes or lonely deserts. The deserts of Egypt swarmed with the &quot;cells&quot; or huts of these anchorites. [[Anthony the Great]], who had retired to the Egyptian Thebaid during the persecution of [[Maximian]], A.D. [[312]], was the most celebrated among them for his
austerities, his sanctity, and his power as an exorcist. His fame collected round him a host of followers imitating his asceticism in an attempt to imitate his sanctity. The deeper he withdrew into the wilderness, the more numerous his disciples became. They refused to be separated from him, and built their ceils round that of their spiritual father. Thus arose the first monastic community, consisting of anchorites living each in his own little dwelling, united together under one superior. Anthony, as Neander remarks (Church History, vol. iii. p. 316, Clark's trans.), &quot;without any conscious design of his own, had become the founder of a new mode of living in common, Coenobitism.&quot; By degrees order
was introduced in the groups of huts. They were arranged in lines like the tents in an encampment, or the houses in a street. From this arrangement these lines of single cells came to be known as Laurae, Laurai, &quot;streets&quot; or &quot;lanes.&quot; 
{{TOCleft}}
The real founder of cenobitic (''koinos,'' common, and ''bios,'' life) monasteries in the modern sense was [[Pachomius]], an Egyptian of the beginning of the [[4th century]]. The first community established by him was at Tabennae, an island of the [[Nile]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. Eight others were founded in the region during his lifetime, numbering 3,000 monks. Within fifty years from his death his societies could claim 50,000 members. These coenobia resembled villages, peopled by a hard-working religious community, all of one sex.

The buildings were detached, small and of the humblest character. Each cell or hut, according to [[Sozomen]] (H.R. iii. 14), contained three monks. They took their chief meal in a common refectory or dining hall at 3 P.M., up to which hour they usually fasted. They ate in silence, with hoods so drawn over their faces that they could see nothing but what was on the table before them. The monks spent the time not devoted to religious services or study in manual labour. [[Palladius]], who visited the Egyptian monasteries about the close of the [[4th century]], found among the 300 members of the coenobium of [[Panopolis]], under the [[Pachomius|Pachomian]] rule, 15 tailors, 7 smiths, 4 carpenters, 12 cameldrivers and 15 tanners. Each separate community had its own ''oeconomus'' or steward, who was subject to a chief steward stationed at the head establishment. All the produce of the monks' labour was committed to him, and by him shipped to [[Alexandria]]. The money raised by the sale was expended in the purchase of stores for the support of the communities, and what was over was devoted to charity. Twice in the year the superiors of the several [[coenobia]] met at the chief monastery, under the presidency of an archimandrite (&quot;the chief of the fold,&quot; from ''miandra'', a sheepfold), and at the last meeting gave in reports of their administration for the year. The coenobia of Syria belonged to the Pachomian institution. We learn many details concerning those in the vicinity of [[Antioch]] from [[Chrysostom]]'s writings. The monks lived in separate huts, ''kalbbia,'' forming a religious hamlet on the mountain side. They were subject to an abbot, and observed a common rule. (They had no refectory, but ate their common meal, of bread and water only, when the day's labour was over, reclining on strewn grass, sometimes out of doors.) Four times in the day they joined in [[prayer]]s and [[psalms]].

===Santa Laura, Mount Athos===
The necessity for defence from hostile attacks (for monastic houses tended to accumulate rich gifts), economy of space and convenience of access from one part of the community to another, by degrees dictated a more compact and orderly arrangement of the buildings of a monastic coenobium. Large piles of building were erected, with strong outside walls, capable of resisting the assaults of an enemy, within which all the necessary edifices were ranged round one or more open courts, usually surrounded with [[cloister]]s. The usual Eastern arrangement is exemplified in the plan of the convent of the [[Holy Laura]], [[Mount Athos]]. &lt;br /&gt;

This monastery, like the oriental monasteries generally, is surrounded by a strong and lofty blank stone wall, enclosing an area of between 3 and 4 acres (12,000 and 16,000 m&amp;sup2;). The longer side extends to a length of about 500 feet. There is only one main entrance, on the north side (A), defended by three separate iron doors. Near the entrance is a large tower (M), a constant feature in the monasteries of the Levant. There is a small postern gate at L. The enceinte comprises two large open courts, surrounded with buildings connected with cloister galleries of wood or stone. The outer court, which is much the larger, contains the granaries and storehouses (K), and the kitchen (H) and other offices connected with the refectory (G). Immediately adjacent to the gateway is a two-storied guest-house, opening from a cloister (C). The inner court is surrounded by a cloister (EE), from which open the monks' cells (II). In the centre of this court stands the [[catholicon]] or conventual church, a square building with an apse of the
cruciform domical Byzantine type, approached by a domed [[narthex]]. In front of the church stands a marble fountain (F), covered by a dome supported on columns.
Opening from the western side of the cloister, but actually standing in the outer court, is the refectory (G), a large cruciform building, about 100 feet (30 m) each way, decorated within with frescoes of saints. At the upper end is a semicircular recess, recalling the triclinium of the Lateran Palace at Rome, in which is placed the seat of the hegumenos or abbot. This apartment is chiefly used as a hall of meeting, the oriental monks usually taking their meals in their separate cells. 

The annexed plan of a [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic]] monastery, from Lenoir, shows a church of three aisles, with cellular apses, and two ranges of cells on either side of an oblong gallery.

== [[Benedictine abbey]]s ==
Monasticism in the West owes its extension and development to [[Benedict of Nursia]] (born A.D. [[480]]). His rule was diffused with miraculous rapidity from the parent foundation on [[Monte Cassino]] through the whole of [[western Europe]], and every country witnessed the erection of monasteries far exceeding anything that had yet been seen in spaciousness and splendour. Few great towns in Italy were without their Benedictine convent, and they quickly rose in all the great centres of population in [[England]], [[France]] and [[Spain]]. The number of these monasteries founded between A.D. [[520]] and [[700]] is amazing. Before the [[Council of Constance]], A.D. [[1415]], no fewer than 15,070 abbeys had been established of this [[order (religious)|order]] alone. The buildings of a Benedictine abbey were uniformly arranged after one plan, modified where necessary (as at Durham and Worcester, where the monasteries stand close to the steep bank of a river) to accommodate the arrangement to local circumstances. We have no existing examples of the earlier monasteries of the Benedictine order. They have all yielded to the ravages of time and the violence of man. But we have fortunately preserved to us an elaborate plan of the great Swiss monastery of St Gall, erected about A.D. [[820]], which puts us in possession of the whole arrangements of a monastery of the first class towards the early part of the 9th century. This curious and interesting plan has been made the subject of a memoir both by [[Keller]] ([[Zürich]], [[1844]]) and by Professor [[Robert Willis]] (''Arch. Journal,'' 1848, vol. v. pp. 86-117. To the latter we are indebted for the substance of the following description, as well as for the plan, reduced from his elucidated transcript of the original preserved in the archives of the convent. The general appearance of the convent is that of a town of isolated houses with streets running between them. It is evidently planned in compliance with the Benedictine rule, which enjoined that, if possible, the monastery should contain within itself every necessary of life, as well as the buildings more intimately connected with the religious and social life of its inmates. It should comprise a [[mill (factory)|mill]], a [[bakehouse]], [[stable]]s, and [[cattle|cow]]-houses, together with accommodation for carrying on all necessary mechanical arts within the walls, so as to obviate the necessity of the monks going outside its limits. 
[[Image:Jumièges.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Abbey of Jumièges, [[Normandy]]]]
The general distribution of the buildings may be thus described:-The church, with its cloister to the south, occupies the centre of a quadrangular area, about 430 feet square. The buildings, as in all great monasteries, are distributed into groups. The church forms the nucleus, as the centre of the religious life of the community. In closest connection with the church is the group of buildings appropriated to the monastic line and its daily requirements---the refectory for eating, the dormitory for sleeping, the common room for social intercourse, the chapter-house for religious and disciplinary conference. These essential elements of monastic life are ranged about a cloister court, surrounded by a covered arcade, affording communication sheltered from the elements between the various buildings. The infirmary for sick monks, with the physician's house and physic garden, lies to the east. In the same group with the infirmary is the school for the novices. The outer school, with its headmaster's house against the opposite wall of the church, stands outside the convent enclosure, in close proximity to the abbot's house, that he might have a constant eye over them. The buildings devoted to hospitality are divided into three groups,--one for the reception of distinguished guests, another for monks visiting the monastery, a third for poor travellers and pilgrims. The first and third are placed to the right and left of the common entrance of the monastery,---the hospitium for distinguished guests being placed on the north side of the church, not far from the abbot's house; that for the poor on the south side next to the farm buildings. The monks are lodged in a guest-house built against the north wall of the church. The group of buildings connected with the material wants of the establishment is placed to the south and west of the church, and is distinctly separated from the monastic buildings. The kitchen, buttery and offices are reached by a passage from the west end of the refectory, and are connected with the bakehouse and brewhouse, which are placed still farther away. The whole of the southern and western sides is devoted to workshops, stables and farm-buildings. The buildings, with some exceptions, seem to have been of one story only, and all but the church were probably erected of wood. The whole includes thirty-three separate blocks. The church (D) is cruciform, with a nave of nine bays, and a semicircular apse at either extremity. That to the west is surrounded by a semicircular colonnade, leaving an open &quot;paradise&quot; (E) between it and the wall of the church. The whole area is divided by screens into various chapels. The high altar (A) stands immediately to the east of the transept, or ritual choir; the altar of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] (B) in the eastern, and that of [[St Peter]] (C) in the western apse. A cylindrical campanile stands detached from the church on either side of the western apse (FF).

church has on its east side the &quot;[[pisalis]]&quot; or &quot;[[calefactory]]&quot;, (H), the common sitting-room of the brethren, warmed by flues beneath the floor. On this side in later monasteries we invariably find the [[chapter house]], the absence of which in this plan is somewhat surprising. It appears, however, from the inscriptions on the plan itself, that the north walk of the cloisters served for the purposes of a chapter-house, and was fitted up with benches on the long sides. Above the calefactory is the &quot;[[dormitory]]&quot; opening into the south transept of the church, to enable the monks to attend the nocturnal services with readiness. A passage at the other end leads to the &quot;[[necessarium]]&quot; (I), a portion of the monastic buildings always planned with extreme care. The southern side is occupied by the &quot;refectory&quot; (K), from the west end of which by a vestibule the kitchen (L) is reached. This is separated from the main buildings of the monastery, and is connected by a long passage with a building containing the bake house and brewhouse (M), and the sleeping-rooms of the servants. The upper story of the refectory is the &quot;vestiarium,&quot; where the ordinary clothes of the brethren were kept. On the western side of the cloister is another two story building (N). The cellar is below, and the [[larder]] and store-room above. Between this building and the church, opening by one door into the cloisters, and by another to the outer part of the monastery area, is the &quot;parlour&quot; for interviews with visitors from the external world (O). On the eastern side of the north transept is the &quot;[[scriptorium]]&quot; or writing-room (P1), with the library above. 

To the east of the church stands a group of buildings comprising two miniature conventual establishments, each complete in itself. Each has a covered cloister surrounded by the usual buildings, i.e. refectory, dormitory, etc., and a church or chapel on one side, placed back to back. A detached building belonging to each contains a bath and a kitchen. One of these diminutive convents is appropriated to the &quot;[[oblati]]&quot; or novices (Q), the other to the sick monks as an &quot;[[infirmary]]&quot; (R). 

The &quot;residence of the physicians&quot; (S) stands contiguous to the infirmary, and the physic garden (T) at the north-east corner of the monastery. Besides other rooms, it contains a drug store, and a chamber for those who are dangerously ill. The &quot;house for bloodletting and purging&quot; adjoins it on the west (U). 

The &quot;outer school,&quot; to the north of the convent area, contains a large schoolroom divided across the middle by a screen or partition, and surrounded by fourteen little rooms, termed the dwellings of the scholars. The head-master's house (W) is opposite, built against the side wall of the church. The two &quot;[[hospitia]]&quot; or  guest-houses for the entertainment of strangers of different degrees (X1 X2) comprise a large common chamber or refectory in the centre, surrounded by sleeping-apartments. Each is provided with its own brewhouse and bakehouse, and that for travellers of a superior order has a kitchen and storeroom, with bedrooms for their servants and stables for their horses. There is also an &quot;hospitium&quot; for strange monks, abutting on the north wall of the church (Y). 

Beyond the cloister, at the extreme verge of the convent area to the south, stands the &quot;factory&quot; (Z), containing workshops for [[shoemaker]]s, saddlers (or shoemakers, sellarii), cutlers and grinders, [[trencher]]-makers, [[tanner]]s, curriers, fullers, [[smith]]s and [[goldsmith]]s, with their dwellings in the rear. On this side we also find the farm buildings, the large granary and threshing-floor (a), mills (c), malthouse (d). Facing the west are the stables (e), ox-sheds (f), goatstables (gl, piggeries (h), sheep-folds
(i), together with the servants' and labourers' quarters (k). At the south-east corner we find the hen and duck house, and poultry-yard (m), and the dwelling of the keeper (n). Hard by is the kitchen garden (o), the beds bearing the names of the vegetables growing in them, onions, garlic, celery, lettuces, poppy, carrots, cabbages, etc., eighteen in all. In the same way the physic garden presents the names of the medicinal herbs, and the cemetery (p) those of the trees, apple, pear, plum, quince, etc., planted there.

==[[Westminster Abbey]]==
Westminster Abbey is another example of a great Benedictine abbey, identical in its general arrangements, so far as they can be traced, with those described above. The cloister and monastic buildings lie to the south side of the church. Parallel to the nave, on the south side of the cloister, was the refectory, with its lavatory at the door.
On the eastern side we find the remains of the dormitory, raised on a vaulted substructure and communicating with the south transept. The chapter-house opens out of the same alley of the cloister. The small cloister lay to the south-east of the larger cloister, and still farther to the east we have the remains of the infirmary with the table hall, the refectory of those who were able to leave their chambers. The abbot's house formed a small courtyard at the west entrance, close to the inner gateway.
Considerable portions of this remain, including the abbot's parlour, celebrated as &quot;the Jerusalem Chamber,&quot; his hall, now used for the Westminster King's Scholars, and the kitchen and butteries beyond.

==York==
[[St Mary's Abbey, York]], of which the ground-plan is annexed, exhibits the usual Benedictine arrangements. The precincts are surrounded by a strong fortified wall on three sides, the river [[Ouse]] being sufficient protection on the fourth side. The entrance was by a strong gateway (U) to the north. Close to the entrance was a chapel, where is now the church of St Olaf (W), in which the new-comers paid their devotions immediately on their arrival. Near the gate to the south was the guest-hall or hospitium (T). The buildings are completely ruined, but enough remains to enable us to identify the grand cruciform church (A), the cloister-court with the chapterhouse (B), the refectory (I), the kitchen-court with its offices (K, O, O) and the other principal apartments. The infirmary has perished completely.

The history of monasticism is one of alternate periods of decay and revival. With growth in popular esteem came increase in material wealth, leading to luxury and worldliness. The first religious ardour cooled, the strictness of the rule was relaxed, until by the [[10th century]] the decay of discipline was so complete in France that the monks are said to have been frequently unacquainted with the rule of St Benedict, and even ignorant that they were bound by any rule at all. The reformation of abuses generally took the form of the establishment of new monastic orders, with new and more stringent rules, requiring a modification of the architectural arrangements. One of the earliest of these reformed orders was the Cluniac. This order took its name from,the little village of Cluny, 12 miles N.W. of Macon, near which, about A.D. [[909]], a reformed Benedictine abbey was founded by William, duke of Aquitaine and count of Auvergne, under Berno, abbot of Beaume. He was succeeded by Odo, who is often regarded as the founder of the order. The fame of Cluny spread far and wide. Its rigid rule was adopted by a vast number of the old Benedictine abbeys, who placed themselves in affiliation to the mother society, while new foundations sprang up in large numbers, all owing allegiance to the &quot;archabbot,&quot; established at Cluny.
By the end of the 12th century the number of monasteries affiliated to Cluny in the various countries of western Europe amounted to 2000. The monastic establishment of Cluny was one of the most extensive and magnificent in France. We may form some idea of its enormous dimensions from the fact recorded, that when, in A.D. [[1245]], [[Pope Innocent IV]], accompanied by twelve cardinals, a patriarch, three archbishops, the two generals of the Carthusians and Cistercians, the king (St Louis), and three of his sons, the queen mother, Baldwin, count of Flanders and emperor of Constantinople, the duke of Burgundy, and six lords, visited the abbey, the whole party, with their attendants, were lodged within the monastery without disarranging the monks, 400 in number. Nearly the whole of the abbey buildings, including the magnificent church, were swept away at the close of the 18th century. When the annexed ground-plan was taken, shortly before its destruction, nearly all the monastery, with the exception of the church, had been rebuilt. 

The church, the ground-plan of which bears a remarkable resemblance to that of Lincoln Cathedral, was of vast dimensions. It was 656 ft. high. The nave (G) had double vaulted aisles on either side. Like Lincoln, it had an eastern as well as a western transept, each furnished with apsidal chapels to the east. The western transept was 213 ft. long, and the eastern 123 ft. The choir terminated in a semicircular apse (F), surrounded by five chapels, also semicircular. The western entrance was approached by an ante-church, or narthex (B), itself an aisled church of no mean dimensions, flanked by two towers, rising from a stately flight of steps bearing a large stone cross. To the south of the church lay the cloister-court (H), of immense size, placed much farther to the west than is usually the case. On the south side of the cloister stood the refectory (P), an immense building, 100 ft (30 m) long and 60 ft (18 m) wide, accommodating six longitudinal and three transverse rows of tables. It was adorned with the portraits of the chief benefactors of the abbey, and with Scriptural subjects. The end wall displayed the Last Judgment. We are unhappily unable to identify any other of the principal buildings (N). The abbot's residence (K), still partly standing, adjoined the entrance-gate. The guest-house (L) was close by. The bakehouse (M), also remaining, is a detached building of immense size.

==English Cluniac==
The first English house of the Cluniac order was that of [[Lewes]], founded by the earl of Warren, c. A.D. 1077. Of this only a few fragments of the domestic buildings exist. The best preserved Cluniac houses in England are Castle Acre, Norfolk, and Wenlock, Shropshire. Ground-plans of both are given in Britton's Architectural Antiquities. They show several departures from the Benedictine arrangement. In each the prior's house is remarkably perfect. All Cluniac houses in England were French colonies, governed by priors of that nation. They did not secure their independence nor become &quot;abbeys&quot; till the reign of Henry VI. The Cluniac revival, with all its brilliancy, was but short-lived. The celebrity of this, as of other orders, worked its moral ruin. With their growth in wealth and dignity the Cluniac foundations became as worldly in life and as relaxed in discipline as their predecessors, and a fresh reform was needed. 

==Cistercian==
[[Image:Abbey-of-senanque-provence-gordes.jpg|thumb||200px|right|Cistercian Abbey of Senanque]]

The next great monastic revival, the [[Cistercian]], arising in the last years of the 11th century, had a wider diffusion, and a longer and more honourable existence. Owing its real origin, as a distinct foundation of reformed [[Benedictines]], in the year [[1098]], to [[Stephen Harding]] (a native of [[Dorset]], educated in the monastery of Sherborne), and deriving its name from Citeaux (Cistercium), a desolate and almost inaccessible forest solitude, on the borders of [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy]], the rapid growth and wide celebrity of the order are undoubtedly to be attributed to the enthusiastic piety of St Bernard, abbot of the first of the monastic colonies, subsequently sent forth in such quick succession by the first Cistercian houses, the far-famed abbey of [[Clairvaux]] (de Clara Valle), A.D. [[1116]]. The rigid self-abnegation, which was the ruling principle of this reformed congregation of the Benedictine order, extended itself to the churches and other buildings erected by them. The characteristic of the Cistercian abbeys was the extremest simplicity and a studied plainness. Only one tower--a central one --was permitted, and that was to be very low. Unnecessary pinnacles and turrets were prohibited. The [[triforium]] was omitted. The windows were to be plain and undivided, and it was forbidden to decorate them with stained glass. All needless ornament was proscribed. The crosses must be of wood; the candlesticks of iron. The renunciation of the world was to be evidenced in all that met the eye. The same spirit manifested itself in the choice of the sites of their monasteries. The more dismal, the more savage, the more hopeless a spot appeared, the more did it please their rigid mood. But they came not merely as ascetics, but as improvers. The Cistercian monasteries are, as a rule, found placed in deep well-watered valleys. They always stand on the border of a stream; not rarely, as at Fountains, the buildings extend over it. These valleys, now so rich and productive, wore a very different aspect when the brethren first chose them as the place of their retirement. Wide swamps, deep morasses, tangled thickets, wild impassable forests, were their prevailing features. The &quot;bright valley,&quot; Clara Vallis of St Bernard, was known as the &quot;valley of Wormwood,&quot; infamous as a den of robbers. &quot;It was a savage dreary solitude, so utterly barren that at first Bernard and his companions were reduced to live on beech leaves.&quot;-(Milman's Lat. Christ. vol. iii. p. 335.)

==Austin Canons==
The buildings of the Austin [[canon (priest)|canons]] or Black canons (so called from the colour of their habit) present few distinctive peculiarities. This order had its first seat in [[England]] at [[Colchester, England|Colchester]], where a house for Austin canons was founded about A.D. [[1105]], and it very soon spread widely. As an order of regular clergy, holding a middle position between monks and secular canons, almost resembling a community of parish priests living under rule, they adopted naves of great length to accommodate large congregations. The choir is usually long, and is sometimes, as at Llanthony and Christchurch (Twynham), shut off from the aisles, or, as at Bolton, Kirkham, etc., is destitute of aisles altogether. The nave in the northern houses, not unfrequently, had only a north aisle, as at Bolton, Brinkburn and [[Lanercost Priory|Lanercost]]. The arrangement of the monastic buildings followed the ordinary type. The prior's lodge was almost invariably attached to the S.W. angle of the nave.

The above plan of the [[Abbey of St Augustine]]'s at [[Bristol]], now the [[Bristol Cathedral|cathedral church of that city]], shows the arrangement of the buildings, which departs very little from the ordinary Benedictine type. The Austin canons' house at Thornton, in Lincolnshire, is remarkable for the size and magnificence of its gate-house, the upper floors of which formed the guest-house of the establishment, and for possessing an octagonal chapter-house of Decorated date.

==Premonstratensians==
The Premonstratensian regular canons, or White canons, had as many as 35 houses in England, of which the most perfect remaining are those of [[Easby, Yorkshire]], and [[Bayham, Kent]]. The head house of the order in England was Welbeck. This order was a reformed branch of the Austin canons, founded, A.D. [[1119]], by Norbert (born at [[Xanten]], on the [[Lower Rhine]], c. [[1080]]) at Premontre, a secluded marshy valley in the forest of [[Coucy]] in the diocese of [[Laon]]. The order spread widely. Even in the founder's lifetime it possessed houses in [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It long maintained its rigid austerity, until in the course of years wealth impaired its discipline, and its members sank into indolence and luxury. The Premonstratensians were brought to England shortly after A.D. [[1140]], and were first settled at Newhouse, in Lincolnshire, near the [[Humber]]. The ground-plan of Easby Abbey, owing to its situation on the edge of the steeply sloping banks of a river, is singularly irregular. The cloister is duly placed on the south side of the church, and the chief buildings occupy their usual positions round it. But the cloister garth, as at Chichester, is not rectangular, and all the surrounding buildings are thus made to sprawl in a very awkward fashion. The church follows the plan adopted by the Austin canons in their northern abbeys, and has only one aisle to the nave--that to the north; while the choir is long, narrow and aisleless. Each transept has an aisle to the east, forming three chapels. 

The church at Bayham was destitute of aisles either to nave or choir. The latter terminated in a three-sided apse. This church is remarkable for its exceeding narrowness in proportion to its length. Extending in longitudinal dimensions 257 ft., it is not more than 25 ft. broad. Stern Premonstratensian canons wanted no congregations, and cared for no possessions; therefore they built their church like a long room.

The Premonstratension order still exists and a small group of these Chanones de Premontre now run the former Benedictine Abbey at Conques in South West France, which has become well known as a refuge for pilgrims travelling the Way of Saint James, from Le Puy en Velay in Auvergne, to Santiago de Compostella in Galicia, Spain.

==Carthusian==
The [[Carthusian]] order, on its establishment by [[Bruno of Cologne|St Bruno]], about A.D. [[1084]], developed a greatly modified form and arrangement of a monastic institution. The principle of this order, which combined the coenobitic with the solitary life, demanded the erection of buildings on a novel plan. This plan, which was first adopted by St Bruno and his twelve companions at the original institution at [[Chartreux]], near [[Grenoble]], was maintained in all the Carthusian establishments throughout [[Europe]], even after the ascetic severity of the order had been to some extent relaxed, and the primitive simplicity of their buildings had been exchanged for the magnificence of decoration which characterizes such foundations as the [[Certosa]]s of [[Pavia]] and [[Florence]]. According to the rule of St Bruno, all the members of a Carthusian brotherhood lived in the most absolute solitude and silence. Each occupied a small detached cottage, standing by itself in a small garden surrounded by high walls and connected by a common corridor or cloister. In these cottages or cells a Carthusian monk passed his time in the strictest asceticism, only leaving his solitary dwelling to attend the services of the Church, except on certain days when the brotherhood assembled in the refectory. The peculiarity of the arrangements of a Carthusian monastery, or charter-house, as it was called in England, from a corruption of the French chartreux, is exhibited in the plan of that of [[Clermont]], from [[Viollet-le-Duc]].

==Clermont==
The whole establishment is surrounded hy a wall, furnished at intervals with watch towers. The enclosure is divided into two courts, of which the eastern court, surrounded by a cloister, from which the cottages of the monks open, is musch the larger. The two courts are divided by the main buildings of the monastery, including the church, the sanctuary, divided from the monks' choir, by a screen with two altars, the smaller cloister to the south surrounded by the chapter-house, the refectory and the chapel of Pontgibaud. The kitchen with its offices lies behind the refectory, accessible from the outer court without entering the cloister. 

To the north of the church, beyond the [[sacristy]], and the side chapels, there is the cell of the sub-prior, with its garden. The lodgings of the prior occupy the centre of the outer court, immediately in front of the west door of the church, and face the gateway of the convent. A small raised court with a fountain is before it. This outer court also contains the guest-chambers, the stables and lodgings of the [[lay brothers]], the barns and granaries, the [[dovecot]] and the bakehouse. There is also a prison. In this outer court, in all the earlier foundations, as at Witham, there was a smaller church in addition to the larger church of the monks.) 

The outer and inner courts are connected by a long passage, wide enough to admit a cart laden with wood to supply the cells of the brethren with fuel. The number of cells surrounding the great cloister is 18. They are all arranged on a uniform plan. Each little dwelling contains three rooms: a sitting-room warmed by a stove in winter; a sleeping-room  furnished with a bed, a table, a bench, and a bookcase; and a closet. Between the cell and the cloister gallery is a passage or corridor, cutting off the inmate of the cell from all sound or movement which might interrupt his meditations. The superior had free access to this corridor, and through open niches was able to inspect the garden without being seen. There is a hatch or turn-table, in which the daily allowance of food was deposited by a brother appointed for that purpose, affording no view either inwards or outwards. 

The above arrangements are found with scarcely any variation in all the charter-houses of western Europe. The [[Yorkshire]] [[Charterhouse]] of [[Mount Grace]], founded by [[Thomas Holland]], the young duke of Surrey, nephew of Richard II. and marshal of England, during the revival of the popularity of the order, about A.D. [[1397]], is the most perfect and best preserved English example. It is characterized by all the simplicity of the order. The church is a modest building, long, narrow and aisleless. Within the wall of enclosure are two courts. The smaller of the two, the south, presents the usual arrangement of church, refectory, etc., opening out of a cloister. The buildings are plain and solid. The northern court contains the cells, 14 in number. 

It is surrotmded by a double stone wall, the two walls being about 30 ft. or 40 ft. apart. Between these, each in its own garden, stand the cells; low-built two-storied cottages, of two or three rooms on the ground-floor, lighted by a larger and a smaller window to the side, and provided with a doorway to the court, and one at the back, opposite to one in the outer wall, through which the monk may have conveyed the sweepings of his cell and the refuse of his garden to the &quot;eremus&quot; beyond. By the side of the door to the court is a little hatch through which the daily pittance of food was supplied, so contrived by turning at an angle in the wall that no one could either look in or look out. A very perfect example of this hatch---an arrangement belonging to all Carthusian houses--exists at [[Miraflores]], near [[Burgos]], which remains nearly as it was completed in 1480. 

There were only nine Carthusian houses in England. The earliest was that at [[Witham]] in [[Somerset]], founded by [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], by whom the order was first brought into England. The wealthiest and most magnificent was that of Sheen or Richmond in [[Surrey]], founded by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] about [[1414]]. The dimensions of the buildings at Sheen are stated to have been remarkably large. The great court measured 300 by 250 ft (91 by 76 m); the cloisters were a square of 500 ft (152 m); the hall was 110 ft (34 m) in length by 60 ft (18 m) in breadth.

==Mendicant Friars==
An article on monastic arrangements would be incomplete without some account of the convents of the Mendicant or Preaching Friars, including the Black Friars or [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s, the Grey or [[Franciscan]]s, the White or [[Carmelites]], the Eremite or [[Augustinians|Augustinian]], Friars. These orders arose at the beginning of the 13th century, with the growth of towns and cities.  Whereas Benedictines and their various branches had worked to achieve self-sufficient agricultural estates, the Mendicant Friars operated differently.  Planting themselves, as a rule, in large towns, and by preference in the poorest and most densely populated districts, the Preaching Friars were obliged to adapt their buildings to the requirements of the site. Regularity of arrangement, therefore, was not possible, even if they had studied it. Their churches, built for the reception of large congregations of hearers rather than worshippers, form a class by themselves, totally unlike those of the elder orders in ground-plan and character. They were usually long parallelograms unbroken by transepts. The nave very usually consisted of two equal bodies, one containing the stalls of the brotherhood, the other left entirely free for the congregation. The constructional choir is often wanting, the whole church forming one uninterrupted structure, with a continuous range of windows. The east end was usually square, but the Friars Church at [[Winchelsea]] had a polygonal apse. We not unfrequently find a single transept, sometimes of great size, rivalling or exceeding the nave. This arrangement is frequent in [[Ireland]], where the numerous small friaries afford admirable exemplifications of these peculiarities of ground-plan. The friars' churches were at first destitute of towers; but in the 14th and 15th centuries, tall, slender towers were commonly inserted between the nave and the choir.  The Grey Friars at Lynn, where the tower is hexagonal, is a good example. The arrangement of the monastic buildings is equally peculiar and characteristic. We miss entirely the regularity of the buildings of the earlier orders. At the Jacobins at Paris, a cloister lay to the north of the long narrow church of two parallel aisles, while the refectory--a room of immense length, quite detached from the cloister--stretched across the area before the west front of the church. At Toulouse the nave also has two parallel aisles, but the choir is apsidal, with radiating chapel. The refectory stretches northwards at right angles to the cloister, which lies to the north of the church, having the chapter-house and sacristy on the east.

==Norwich, Gloucester ==
As examples of English friaries, the Dominican house at [[Norwich]], and those of the Dominicans and Franciscans at Gloucester, may be mentioned. The church of the Black Friars of Norwich departs from the original type in the nave (now St Andrew's Hall), in having regular aisles. In this it resembles the earlier examples of the Grey Friars at Reading. The choir is long and aisleless; an hexagonal tower between the two, like that existing at Lynn, has perished. Thc cloister and monastic buildings remain tolerably perfect to the north. The Dominican convent at Gloucester still exhibits the cloister-court, on the north side of which is the desecrated church. The refectory is on the west side and on the south the dormitory of the 13th century. This is a remarkably good example. There were 18 cells or cubicles on each side, divided by partitions, the bases of which remain. On the east side was the prior's house, a building of later date. At the Grey or Franciscan Friars, the church followed the ordinary type in having two equal bodies, each gabled, with a continuous range of windows. There was a slender tower between the nave and the choir. 

==Hulne==
Of the convents of the Carmelite or White Friars we have a good example in the Abbey of Hulne, near Alnwick, the first of the order in England, founded A.D. [[1240]].

The church is a narrow oblong, destitute of aisles, 123 ft. long by only 26 ft. wide. The cloisters are to the south, with the chapter-house, etc., to the east, with the dormitory over. The prior's lodge is placed to the west of the cloister. The guest-houses adjoin the entrance gateway, to which a chapel was annexed on the south side of the conventual area. The nave of the church of the Austin Friars or Eremites in London is still standing. It is of Decorated date, and has wide centre and side aisles, divided by a very light and graceful arcade. Some fragments of the south walk of the cloister of the Grey Friars remained among the buildings of [[Christ's Hospital]] (the Blue-Coat School), while they were still standing. Of the Black Friars all has perished but the name. Taken as a whole, the remains of the establishments of the friars afford little warrant for the bitter invective of the Benedictine of St Alban's, Matthew Paris: &quot;The friars who have been founded hardly 40 years have built residences as the palaces of kings. These are they who, enlarging day by day their sumptuous edifices, encircling them with lofty walls, lay up in them their incalculable treasures, imprudently transgressing the bounds of poverty and violating the very fundamental rules of their profession.&quot; Allowance must here be made for jealousy of a rival order just rising in popularity.

==Cells==
Every large monastery had depending upon it smaller foundations known as cells or priories. Sometimes these foundations were no more than a single building serving as residence and farm offices, while other examples were miniature monasteries for 5 or 10 monks. The outlying farming establishments belonging to the monastic foundations were known as villae or granges. They were usually staffed by [[lay-brothers]], sometimes under the supervision of a single monk.

==Abbots and abbesses as rulers==
Some cities were ruled by heads of a certain abbey. For more information, see [[abbey-principality]].

==Nunnery==
A '''nunnery''' is a convent of nuns. The first nunnery in England was built at [[Folkestone]] in about 635 by [[Eadbald of Kent|King Eadbald]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Annales School''' is a school of historical writing named after the French scholarly journal ''[[Annales d'histoire économique et sociale]]'' (later called ''[[Annales. Economies, sociétés, civilisations]]'', then renamed in [[1994]] as ''[[Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales]]'') where it was first expounded. Annales school history is best known for incorporating [[social science|social scientific]] methods into history.

The Annales was founded and edited by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]] in [[1929]], while they were teaching at the [[University of Strasbourg]]. These authors quickly became associated with the distinctive Annales approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the [[Annee Sociologique]] (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th century historians. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''[[la longue durée]]'') over events.  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalities'' or the psychology of the epoch are also characteristic areas of study.
An eminent member of this school, [[Georges Duby]], wrote in the forward of his book &quot;Le dimanche de Bouvines&quot; that the history he is teaching &quot;rejected on the sidelines the sensational, was reluctant to the simple acounting of events, strived on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting the surface trepidations, wanted to observe on the long and medium term the evolution of economy, society and civilisation.&quot;      

Bloch was shot by the [[Gestapo]] during the German occupation of France in [[World War II]], and Febvre carried on the Annales approach in the 1940s and 1950s. It was during this time that he trained [[Fernand Braudel]], who would become one of the best known exponents of this school. Braudel's work came to define a 'second' era of Annales historiography and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the Mediterranean region in the era of Philip II of Spain.

While authors such as [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] and [[Jacques Le Goff]] continue to carry the Annales banner, today the Annales approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in [[cultural history]] and [[economic history]].

{{Antimatter}}
'''Antimatter''' or '''contra-terrene matter''' is [[matter]] that is composed of the [[antiparticle]]s of those that constitute normal matter. If a particle and its antiparticle come in contact with each other, the two [[Annihilation|annihilate]] and produce a burst of [[energy]], which results in the production of other particles and antiparticles or [[electromagnetic radiation]]. In these reactions, [[rest mass]] is not conserved, although (as in any other reaction) energy ([[E=mc²]]) is conserved.

== History ==
In 1928 [[Paul Dirac]] developed a [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] equation for the [[electron]], now known as the [[Dirac equation]]. Curiously, the equation was found to have negative energy solutions in addition to the normal positive ones. This presented a problem, as electrons tend toward the lowest possible energy level; energies of negative infinity are nonsensical. As a way of getting around this, Dirac proposed that the vacuum can be considered a &quot;sea&quot; of negative energy, the [[Dirac sea]]. Any electrons would therefore have to sit on top of the sea.

Thinking further, Dirac found that a &quot;hole&quot; in the sea would have a positive charge. At first he thought that this was the [[proton]], but [[Hermann Weyl]] pointed out the hole should have the same mass as the electron. The existence of this particle, the [[positron]], was confirmed experimentally in 1932 by [[Carl D. Anderson]]. 

Today's [[standard model]] shows that every particle has an antiparticle, for which each additive [[quantum number]] has the negative of the value it has for the normal matter particle. The sign reversal applies only to quantum numbers (properties) which are additive, such as [[charge]], but not to [[mass]], for example. The [[positron]] has the opposite charge but the same mass as the electron. An [[atom]] of [[antihydrogen]] is composed of a negatively-charged [[antiproton]] being [[atomic orbital|orbited]] by a positively-charged [[positron]] .

== Antimatter production ==
===Artificial production===
The artificial production of antimatter (specifically [[antihydrogen]]) first became a reality in the early 1990s. [[Charles Munger]] of the [[SLAC]], and associates at [[Fermilab]], realised that an [[antiproton]], travelling at [[relativistic speeds]] and passing close to the [[nucleus]] of an [[atom]], would have the potential to force the creation of an [[electron]]-[[positron]] pair. It was postulated that under this scenario the antiproton would have a small chance of pairing with the positron (ejecting the electron) to form an antihydrogen atom.

In [[1995]] [[CERN]] announced that it had successfully created 9 antihydrogen atoms by implementing the SLAC/Fermilab concept during the [[PS210 experiment]]. The experiment was preformed using the Low-Energy Antiproton Ring ([[LEAR]]), and was lead by [[Walter Oelert]] and [[Mario Macri]]. Fermilab soon confirmed the CERN findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities.

The antihydrogen atoms created during PS210, and subsequent experiments (at both CERN and Fermilab) were extremely energetic (&quot;hot&quot;) and were not well suited to study. To resolve this hurdle, and to gain a better understanding of antihydrogen, two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s - [[ATHENA]] and [[ATRAP]]. The primary goal of these collaborations is the creation of less energetic (&quot;cold&quot;) antihydrogen, better suited to study.

In [[1999]] CERN activated the [[Antiproton Decelerator]], a device capable of decelerating antiprotons from 3.5 GeV/c to 5.3 MeV – still too &quot;hot&quot; to produce study effective antihydrogen, but a huge leap forward.

In late [[2002]] the ATHENA project announced that they had created the worlds first &quot;cold&quot; antihydrogen. The antiprotons used in the experiment were 'cooled' sufficiently by decelerating them (using the Antiproton Decelerator), passing them through a thin sheet of foil, and finally capturing them in a [[Penning Trap]]. The antiprotons also underwent [[stochastic cooling]] at several stages during the process.

The ATHENA team's antiproton cooling process is effective, but highly inefficient. Approximately 25 million antiprotons leave the Antiproton Decelerator; roughly 10 thousand make it to the Penning Trap.

In early 2004 ATHENA researchers released data on a new method of creating low energy antihydrogen. 

The technique involves slowing antiprotons using the Antiproton Decelerator, and injecting them into a Penning trap (specifically a Penning-Malmberg trap). Once trapped the antiprotons are mixed with electrons that have been cooled to an energy potential significantly less than the antiprotons; the resulting Coulomb collisions cool the antiprotons while warming the electrons until the particles reach an equilibrium of approximately 4 K. 

While the antiprotons are being cooled in the first trap, a small cloud of positron plasma is injected into a second trap (the mixing trap). Exciting the resonance of the mixing trap’s confinement fields can control the temperature of the positron plasma; but the procedure is more effective when the plasma is in thermal equilibrium with the trap’s environment. The positron plasma cloud is generated in a positron accumulator prior to injection; the source of the positrons is usually radioactive sodium.

Once the antiprotons are sufficiently cooled, the antiproton-electron mixture is transferred into the mixing trap (containing the positrons). The electrons are subsequently removed by a series of fast pulses in the mixing traps electrical field. When the antiprotons reach the positron plasma further Coulomb collisions occur, resulting in further cooling of the antiprotons. When the positrons and antiprotons approach thermal equilibrium antihydrogen atoms begin to form. Being electrically neutral the antihydrogen atoms are not effected by the trap and can leave the confinement fields.

Using this method ATHENA researchers predict they will be able to create to 100 antihydrogen atoms per operational second.

ATHENA and ATRAP are now seeking to further 'cool' the antihydrogen atoms by subjecting them to an [[inhomogeneous field]]. While antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral, their spin produces [[magnetic moments]]. These magnetic moments vary depending on the [[spin direction]] (up or down) of the atom, and can be deflected by inhomogeneous fields regardless of electrical charge.

The biggest limiting factor in the production of antimatter is the availability of antiprotons. Recent data released by CERN states that when fully operational their facilities are capable of producing &lt;math&gt;10^7&lt;/math&gt; antiprotons per second. Assuming an optimal conversion of antiprotons to antihydrogen (which is far from true) it would take two billion years (give or take a few thousand) to produce 1 gram of antihydrogen.

Another limiting factor to antimatter production is storage. As stated above there is no known way to effectively store antihydrogen. The ATHENA project has managed to keep antihydrogen atoms from annihilation for 10s of seconds - just enough time to briefly study their behaviour.

Antimatter/matter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging, such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET). In some kinds of [[beta decay]], a nuclide loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron (in the same event, a proton becomes a neutron, and [[neutrino]]s are also given off). Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a [[cyclotron]] and are widely generated for medical use.

===Naturally occurring production===
Antiparticles are created everywhere in the [[universe]] where high-energy particle collisions take place. High-energy [[cosmic ray]]s impacting Earth's atmosphere (or any other matter in the [[solar system]]) produce minute quantities of antimatter in the resulting [[particle jet]]s, which is immediately destroyed by contact with nearby matter. It may similarly be produced in regions like the center of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]], where very energetic celestial events occur. The presence of the resulting antimatter is detected by the gamma rays produced when it annihilates with nearby matter.

Antiparticles are also produced in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature (mean particle energy greater than the [[pair production]] threshold). The region of space near a [[black hole]]'s [[event horizon]] can be thought of as being such an environment, with the resulting matter and antimatter being a component of [[Hawking radiation]]. During the period of [[baryogenesis]], when the universe was extremely hot and dense, matter and antimatter were continually produced and annihilated. The presence of remaining matter, and absence of detection of remaining antimatter{{ref|BigBang}}, is attributed to [[CP-violation|violation]] of the [[CP-symmetry]] relating matter and antimatter. The exact mechanism of this violation during baryogenesis remains a mystery.

== Notation ==
Physicists need a notation to distinguish particles from antiparticles. One way is to denote an antiparticle by adding a bar (or [[macron]]) over the symbol for the particle. For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{p}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathrm{p}}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; and e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Adding a bar over the e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symbol would be redundant and is not done.

== Antimatter as fuel ==
In antimatter-matter collisions, the entire rest [[mass]] of the particles is converted to [[energy]]. The [[Energies per unit mass|energy per unit mass]] is about 10 orders of magnitude greater than chemical energy, and about 2 orders of magnitude greater than nuclear energy that can be liberated today using chemical reactions or nuclear fission/fusion. The reaction of 1 [[kilogram|kg]] of antimatter with 1 kg of matter would produce 1.8&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule|J]] (180 petajoules) of energy (by the equation ''[[E=mc²]]''). In contrast, burning a kilogram of [[petrol|gasoline]] produces 4.2&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; J, and [[nuclear fusion]] of a kilogram of hydrogen would produce 2.6&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; J.
Not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic technology, because as much as 50% of energy produced in reactions between nucleons and antinucleons is carried away by [[neutrinos]], so, for all intents and purposes, it can be considered lost.{{ref|Reactions}}

The scarcity of antimatter means that it is not readily available to be used as fuel, although it could be used in [[antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion]].  Generating a single antiproton is immensely difficult and requires particle accelerators and vast amounts of energy&amp;mdash;millions of times more than is released after it is annihilated with ordinary matter, due to inefficiencies in the process.  Known methods of producing antimatter from energy also produce an equal amount of normal matter, so the theoretical limit is that half of the input energy is converted to antimatter.  Counterbalancing this, when antimatter annihilates with ordinary matter, energy equal to twice the mass of the antimatter is liberated&amp;mdash;so energy storage in the form of antimatter could (in theory) be 100% efficient.  Antimatter production is currently very limited, but has been growing at a nearly geometric rate since the discovery of the first antiproton in 1955.{{ref|History}}  The current antimatter production rate is between 1 and 10 nanograms per year, and this is expected to increase dramatically with new facilities at [[CERN]] and [[Fermilab]].  With current technology, it is considered possible to attain antimatter for [[United States dollar|US$]]25 million per gram by optimizing the collision and collection parameters (given current electricity generation costs).  Antimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied in with electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online without the advent of such technologies as [[deuterium]]-tritium [[fusion power]].  However, it should be noted that in 2004, the annual production of antiprotons at CERN was several picograms at a cost of $20 million. This means to produce 1 gram of antimatter, CERN would need to spend 100 million trillion dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.

Several [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]]-funded studies are exploring whether the antimatter that occurs naturally in the [[Van Allen belt]]s of Earth, and ultimately, the belts of gas giants like [[Jupiter]], might be able to be collected with magnetic scoops, at hopefully a lower cost per gram.{{ref|VanAllenBelts}}

Since the energy density is vastly higher than these other forms, the thrust to weight equation used in [[antimatter rocket]]ry and [[spacecraft]] would be very different. In fact, the energy in a few grams of antimatter is enough to transport an unmanned spacecraft to [[Mars]] in about a month&amp;mdash;the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] took eleven months to reach Mars.  It is hoped that antimatter could be used as [[fuel]] for [[interplanetary travel]] or possibly [[interstellar travel]], but it is also feared that if humanity ever gets the capabilities to do so, there could be the construction of [[antimatter weapon]]s.

== The Antiuniverse ==
Dirac himself was the first to consider the existence of antimatter in an astronomical scale. But it was only after the confirmation of his theory, with the discovery of the positron, antiproton and antineutron that real speculation began on the possible existence of an antiuniverse. In the following years, motivated by basic [[symmetry]] principles, it was believed that the [[universe]] must consist of both matter and antimatter in equal amounts. If, however there were an isolated system of antimatter in the universe, free from interaction with ordinary matter, no earthbound observation could distinguish its true content, as photons (being their own antiparticle) are the same whether they are in a “universe” or an “antiuniverse”.

But assuming large zones of antimatter exist, there must be some boundary where antimatter atoms from the antimatter [[galaxies]] or [[stars]] will come into contact with normal atoms. In those regions a powerful flux of [[gamma rays]] would be produced. This has never been observed despite deployment of very sensitive instruments in space to detect them.

It is now thought that symmetry was broken in the early universe when [[charge]] and [[parity]] symmetry was violated ([[CP-violation]]). Standard [[Big Bang]] cosmology tells us that the universe initially contained equal amounts of matter and antimatter: however particles and [[antiparticle]]s evolved slightly differently. It was found that a particular heavy unstable particle, which is its own antiparticle, decays slightly more often to positrons (e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) than to electrons (e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;). How this accounts for the preponderance of matter over antimatter has not been completely explained. The [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] does have a way of accommodating a difference between the evolution of matter and antimatter, but it falls short of explaining the net excess of matter in the universe by about 10 orders of magnitude.

After Dirac, the sci-fi writers had a field day with visions of antiworlds,
antistars and antiuniverses, all made of antimatter, and it is still a common [[plot device]], however suppositions of the existence a coeval, antimatter duplicate of this universe are not taken seriously in modern [[cosmology]].

== Antimatter in popular culture ==
The extremely large amount of energy released by matter/antimatter annihilation has inspired many appearances in fiction:

*A famous fictional example of antimatter in action is in the [[science fiction]] franchise ''[[Star Trek]]'', where it is a common energy source for [[starship]]s; large reactors generate power by mixing supercooled deuterium and antideuterium, with the annihilation reaction regulated by [[dilithium]] crystals. It is also used as a weapon, as in [[photon torpedo]]es.
*Antimatter engines also appear in various books of the ''[[Dragonriders of Pern]]'' series by [[Anne McCaffrey]]. 
*In [[Larry Niven|Niven's]] ''[[Ringworld]]'' series, antimatter appears as a weapon useful against even the super-dense matter [[scrith]].  
*[[Dan Brown]] explores the use of antimatter as a [[weapon]] in his novel ''[[Angels and Demons]]'', where terrorists threaten to destroy the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] with potentially unstable antimatter stolen from [[CERN]]. 
*In ''[[The Night's Dawn Trilogy]]'' by [[Peter F. Hamilton]], antimatter is characterized as the most dangerous substance imaginable and outlawed across the Galaxy. 
*Antimatter is briefly referenced in the 1966 movie ''[[Batman: The Movie]],'' (several evil henchmen are turned into antimatter when they are revived using &quot;heavy water&quot; from the batcave), but the concept remains completely unexplained in this example.
*In the episode of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', &quot;The Planet of Evil,&quot; the scientist Dr. Sorenson is transformed into an 'antiman' due to exposure to antimatter.
*Late in ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', Riff confirms to Dr. Furter that the pitchfork-like weapon he has pointed at him is &quot;a [[laser]], capable of emitting a beam of pure antimatter.&quot; This misuse of the term led to the audience-response line, &quot;Then it's not a laser.&quot;
*In [[comic books]] produced by [[DC Comics]], the notion of an antiuniverse, or in DC's parlance Anti-Matter Universe, was first utilized in the ''[[Green Lantern]]'' series in the [[1960s]]. The Anti-Matter Universe contains a world known as [[Qward]], home to the [[Green Lantern Corps]]' sworn enemies, the Weaponers of Qward.  
*In the ''[[City of Heroes]]'' comic book, the [[superhero]] [[Positron (City of Heroes)|Positron]] is capable of generating anti-matter, and utilizing it as a weapon.
*In 1985, a powerful, twisted denizen of the Anti-Matter Universe known as the [[Anti-Monitor]] succeeded in destroying most of the DC [[Multiverse]] during the events of the twelve-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.
*The [[Protoss]] race of [[Starcraft]] uses antimatter for both propulsion and weaponry.

'''Casa Batlló''' (pronounce Casa Batyo) is a building designed by [[Antoni Gaudi]] and built in years [[1905]]&amp;ndash;[[1907]]; located at 43, Passeig de Gràcia (''passeig'' is [[Catalan language|Catalan]] for promenade or [[avenue]]), part of the [[Illa de la Discòrdia]] in the ''[[Eixample]]'' district of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. 

The local name for the building is ''Casa dels ossos'' (house of bones), and indeed it does have a [[viscera]]l, [[skeleton|skeletal]] organic quality.  It was originally designed for a [[middle-class]] family and situated in a prosperous district of Barcelona. 

The building looks very remarkable &amp;mdash; like everything Gaudi designed, only identifiable as [[Art Nouveau]] in the broadest sense.  The ground floor, in particular, is rather astonishing with tracery, irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work.

It seems that the goal of the designer was to avoid straight lines completely. Much of the [[façade]] is decorated with a [[mosaic]] made of broken ceramic tiles that starts in shades of golden orange moving into greenish blues. The roof is [[arch]]ed and was likened to the back of a [[European dragon|dragon]] or [[dinosaur]]. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the sword of [[Saint George]], which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.

'''Park Güell''' is a garden complex with [[Architecture|architectural]] elements situated on the hill of [[El Carmel]] in the [[Gràcia]] district of [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]. It was designed by the [[Catalan]] [[architect]] [[Antoni Gaudi|Antoni Gaudí]] and built in the years [[1900]] to [[1914]]. It is one of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]].

The Park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site. The idea of Count [[Eusebio de Guell]]. It was inspired by British developments, hence the original English name ''Park''. It has been converted into a municipal garden. It can be reached by underground, although the stations are at a certain distance, by the regular buses, or best by the tourist buses. While the Park is free, Gaudí's house &amp;mdash; containing furniture that he designed &amp;mdash; can be visited at a cost.

[[image:Park Guell Terrace.JPG|left|thumb|[[Gaudí]]'s mosaic work on the main terrace]]

The design of the Park is clearly the work of an architect and Gaudí's unique style is also easily distinguishable.  Wavy, lava-like shapes, at places tree-like or in form of Doric columns or stalactites, sometimes lavishly decorated with ornaments of [[trencadís|broken ceramic fragments, a Catalan technique]]. The landscaping of the Park is largely in tune with the natural terrain; steep slopes and cliffs have been allowed to remain, with winding paths, cuttings and grottoes adding to the natural feel. 

Although it sounds unlikely, the place is skillfully designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park.  The buildings, though very original and remarkable, are relatively inconspicuous, considering other buildings designed by Gaudí. They have fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles.  The focal point of the park is the main terrace, surrounded by a long bench in the form of a [[sea serpent]]. Gaudí used a naked man, sitting in clay, to design the bench. The curves form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. 

The large cross at the Park's high-point offers the most complete view of Barcelona. It is possible to view the main city in panaroma, with the [[Sagrada Familia]] and the [[Montjuïc]] area visible at a distance.

'''Casa Milà''', better known as '''La Pedrera''' (Catalan for 'The Quarry'), is a building designed by the Catalan [[architect]] [[Antoni Gaudi|Antoni Gaudí]] and built in the years [[1905]] to [[1907]].  It is located at 92, Passeig de Gràcia ('passeig' is Catalan for promenade or avenue) in the ''[[Eixample]]'' district of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. It was built for Roger Segimon de Milà. It is one of the UNESCO [[World Heritage Sites]].

The building does not have any straight lines. Most people consider it magnificent and overwhelming -- some say it is like waves of lava or a sand-dune. This building seems to break our understanding of conventional [[architecture]]. The most astonishing part is the roof with an almost lunar appearance and dreamlike landscape.

The building can be considered more of a sculpture than a regular building. Critics remark on its detachment from usefulness, but others consider it to be art.  The Barcelonese of the time considered it ugly, hence the &quot;quarry&quot; nickname, but today it is a landmark of Barcelona.

Casa Milà was a predecessor of some buildings with a similar [[biomorphism|biomorphic]] appearance:  

* the 1921 [[Einstein Tower]] in [[Potsdam]], designed by [[Erich Mendelsohn]]
* [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]
* [[Chapelle Notre Dame du Haut]], [[Ronchamp]], [[France]], designed by [[Le Corbusier]]
* the [[Hundertwasserhaus]] and other words by Austrian architect [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]]
* Disney Concert Hall in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], by [[Frank Gehry]]

Free exhibitions are often held on the first floor, which also provides some opportunity to see the interior design. There is a charge of €7 for entrance to the apartments and roof.

Corresponding to each kind of [[particle physics|particle]], there is an associated '''antiparticle''' with the same [[mass]] and [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. Some particles, such as the [[photon]], are identical to their antiparticle; such particles must have no [[electric charge]], but not all charge-neutral particles are of this kind. The laws of nature were thought to be symmetric between particles and antiparticles until [[CP violation]] experiments found that [[time-reversal symmetry]] is violated in nature. The observed excess of [[baryon]]s over anti-baryons in the universe is one of the primary [[Unsolved problems in physics|unsolved problems]] in [[cosmology]].

Particle-antiparticle pairs can annihilate each other if they are in appropriate [[quantum state]]s. They can also be produced in various processes. These processes are used in today's [[particle accelerator]]s to create new particles and to test theories of [[particle physics]]. High energy processes in nature can create antiparticles. These are visible in [[cosmic ray]]s and in certain [[nuclear reaction]]s. The word [[antimatter]] properly refers to (elementary) antiparticles, composite antiparticles made with them (such as [[antihydrogen]]) and to larger assemblies of either.

== History ==

=== Experiment ===

In [[1932]], soon after the prediction of [[positron]]s by [[Paul Dirac]], [[Carl D. Anderson]] found that cosmic-ray collisions produced these particles in a [[cloud chamber]]&amp;mdash; a [[particle detector]] in which moving [[electron]]s (or positrons) leave behind trails as they move through the gas.  The [[electric charge]]-to-[[mass]] ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the curling of its cloud-chamber track in a [[magnetic field]].  Originally, positrons, because of the direction that their paths curled, were mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction.

The antiproton and antineutron were found by [[Emilio Segrè]] and [[Owen Chamberlain]] in [[1955]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  Since then the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments.  In recent years, complete atoms of [[antimatter]] have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons, collected in electromagnetic traps.

=== Hole theory ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... the development of quantum field theory made the interpretation of antiparticles as holes unnecessary, even though unfortunately it lingers on in many textbooks.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp; [[Steven Weinberg]] in ''The quantum theory of fields'', Vol I, p 14, ISBN 0521550017
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Solutions of the [[Dirac equation]] contained negative energy quantum states. As a result, an electron could always radiate energy and fall into a negative energy state. Even worse, it could keep radiating infinite amount of energy because there were infinitely negative energy states available. To prevent this unphysical situation from happening, Dirac proposed that a &quot;sea&quot; of negative-energy electrons fills the universe, already occupying all of the lower energy states so that, due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] no other electron could fall into them. Sometimes, however, one of these negative energy particles could be lifted out of this [[Dirac sea]] to become a positive energy particle.  But when lifted out, it would leave behind a ''hole'' in the sea which would act exactly like a positive energy electron with a reversed charge. These he interpreted as the [[proton]], and called his paper of 1930 ''A theory of electrons and protons''.

Dirac was aware of the problem that his picture implied an infinite negative charge for the universe. Dirac tried to argue that we would perceive this as the normal state of zero charge. Another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton. Dirac tried to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea, until [[Hermann Weyl]] proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges. Dirac also predicted a reaction &lt;b&gt;e&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;p&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;γ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;γ&lt;/b&gt; (electron and proton annihilate to give two [[photon]]s). [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Igor Tamm]] proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast. A year later, in 1931, Dirac modified his theory and postulated the [[positron]], a new particle of the same mass as the electron. The discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory.

However, the problem of infinite charge of the universe remains.  Also, as we now know, [[bosons]] (if they exist) also have antiparticles, but since they do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle, hole theory doesn't work for them. A unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in [[quantum field theory]], which solves both these problems.

== Particle-antiparticle annihilation ==

''Main article: [[Annihilation]]''.
[[Image:kkbar had.png|frame|An example of a virtual [[pion]] pair which influences the propagation of a [[kaon]] causing a neutral kaon to ''mix'' with the antikaon. This is an example of [[renormalization]] in [[quantum field theory]]&amp;mdash; the field theory being necessary because the number of particles changes from one to two and back again.]]

If a particle and antiparticle are in the appropriate quantum states, then they can '''annihilate''' each other and produce other particles. Reactions such as &lt;b&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp; e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp; γ &amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp; γ&lt;/b&gt; (the two-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair) is an example.
The single-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair, &lt;b&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp; e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp; γ&lt;/b&gt; cannot occur because it is impossible to conserve energy and momentum together in this process. The reverse reaction is also impossible for this reason. However, in [[quantum field theory]] this process is allowed as an intermediate quantum state for times short enough that the violation of energy conservation can be accommodated by the [[uncertainty principle]]. This opens the way for '''virtual pair''' production or annihilation in which a one particle quantum state may ''fluctuate'' into a two particle state and back. These processes are important in the [[vacuum state]] and [[renormalization]] of a [[quantum field theory]]. It also opens the way for [[neutral particle mixing]] through processes such as the one pictured here: which is a complicated example of [[mass renormalization]].

== Properties of antiparticles ==

[[Quantum state]]s of a particle and an antiparticle can be interchanged by applying the [[C-symmetry|charge conjugation]] (&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;), [[P-symmetry|parity]] (&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;), and [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] (&lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;). If &lt;b&gt;|p,σ,n&gt;&lt;/b&gt; denotes the quantum state of a particle (&lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt;) with momentum &lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;, spin &lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt; whose component in the z-direction is σ, then one has
::&lt;b&gt;CPT |p,σ,n&gt; &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; (-1)&lt;sup&gt;J-σ&lt;/sup&gt; |p,-σ,n&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;
where &lt;b&gt;n&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; denotes the charge conjugate state, ie, the antiparticle. This behaviour under &lt;b&gt;CPT&lt;/b&gt; is the same as the statement that the particle and its antiparticle lie in the same [[irreducible representation]] of the [[Poincare group]]. Properties of antiparticles can be related to those of particles through this. If &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt; is a good symmetry of the dynamics, then
::&lt;b&gt;T |p,σ,n&gt; &amp;nbsp;α&amp;nbsp; |-p,-σ,n&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
::&lt;b&gt;CP |p,σ,n&gt; &amp;nbsp;α&amp;nbsp; |-p,σ,n&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
::&lt;b&gt;C |p,σ,n&gt; &amp;nbsp;α&amp;nbsp; |p,σ,n&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;
where the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side. In other words, particle and antiparticle must have
*the same mass &lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;
*the same spin state &lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt;
*opposite [[electric charge]]s &lt;b&gt;q&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;-q&lt;/b&gt;.

== Quantum field theory ==

&lt;i&gt;This section draws upon the ideas, language and notation of [[canonical quantization]] of a [[quantum field theory]].&lt;/i&gt;

One may try to quantize an electron [[field (physics)|field]] without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing

::&lt;b&gt;ψ(x) &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; ∑&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(x) a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; e&lt;sup&gt;-i E(k)t&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;

where we use the symbol &lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt; to denote the quantum numbers &lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt; and σ of the previous section and the sign of the energy, &lt;b&gt;E(k)&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; denotes the corresponding annihilation operators. Of course, since we are dealing with [[fermion]]s, we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti-commutation relations. However, if one now writes down the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]

::H &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; ∑&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; E(k) a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;

then one sees immediately that the expectation value of &lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt; need not be positive. This is because &lt;b&gt;E(k)&lt;/b&gt; can have any sign whatsoever, and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value 1 or 0.

So one has to introduce the charge conjugate ''antiparticle'' field, with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations

::&lt;b&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;k'&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k'&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

where &lt;b&gt;k'&lt;/b&gt; has the same &lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;, and opposite σ and sign of the energy. Then one can rewrite the field in the form

::&lt;b&gt;ψ(x) &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; ∑&lt;sub&gt;k(+)&lt;/sub&gt; u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(x) a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; e&lt;sup&gt;-i E(k)t&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp; ∑&lt;sub&gt;k(-)&lt;/sub&gt; u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(x) b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; e&lt;sup&gt;-i E(k)t&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;

where the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy. The energy becomes

::&lt;b&gt;H &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; ∑&lt;sub&gt;k(+)&lt;/sub&gt; E(k) a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp; ∑&lt;sub&gt;k(-)&lt;/sub&gt; |E(k)| b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; b&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp; E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;

where &lt;b&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is an infinite negative constant. The [[vacuum state]] is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle, ie, &lt;b&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; |0&gt; = 0&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; |0&gt; = 0&lt;/b&gt;. Then the energy of the vacuum is exactly &lt;b&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum, &lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt; is positive definite. Analysis of the properties of &lt;b&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; shows that one is the annihilation operator for particles and the other for antiparticles. This is the case of a [[fermion]].

This approach is due to [[Vladimir Fock]], [[Wendell Furry]] and [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. If one quantizes a real [[scalar field]], then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator; therefore real scalar fields describe neutral [[boson]]s. Since complex scalar fields admit two different kinds of annihilation operators, which are related by conjugation, such fields describe charged [[boson]]s.

=== The Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation ===

[[Image:antiparticle.png|thumb|350 px|left|Observer 1 sees two particles, one propagating inside the light cone, the other outside the light cone. Observer 2, moving at a uniform velocity with respect to the first observer, could then see the second particle as moving back in time, and with reversed charge: hence as an antiparticle. However, the mass and lifetime of such a particle would remain unchanged, as a consequence of relativity.]]

By considering the propagation of the positive energy half of the electron field backward in time, [[Richard Feynman]] showed that [[causality]] is violated unless one allows some particles to travel faster than [[light]]. However, if particles are allowed to do that, then from the point of view of another [[inertial observer]] it would look like it was travelling backward in [[time]] with the opposite [[charge]].

Hence Feynman reached a pictorial understanding of the fact that the particle and antiparticle have equal mass &lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt; and spin &lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt; but opposite charges. This allowed him to rewrite [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] precisely in the form of diagrams, called [[Feynman diagram]]s, of particles propagating back and forth in time. This technique now is the most widespread method of computing amplitudes in [[quantum field theory]].

This picture was independently developed by [[Ernst Stueckelberg]], and has been called the '''Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation''' of antiparticles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arabian Prince''' (born '''Mik Lezan''') is an [[electro hop]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[rapping|rapper]] from [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. He started his career at [[RapSur Records]], a label setup by Russ Parr, and released some electro classics like &quot;Innovator&quot; &amp; &quot;Strange Life&quot;. A couple of years later he joined the Compton, CA, rap group [[Niggaz with Attitude]] (N.W.A.). The Arabian Prince found the going tough when he departed the group for a solo career in 1988. His debut Brother Arab on Orpheus barely scraped the bottom of the R&amp;B and pop charts in 1989. His first solo releases are in high demand nowadays. His credit albums include ''[[Brother Arab]]'' and ''[[Where's My Bytches]]'', as well as work on [[N.W.A.]]'s ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' and [[record producer|production]] for various other [[West Coast rap|West Coast hip hop]] artists.
Arabian Prince has reappeared testing [[Computer and video games|video games]] for [[FOX Interactive]] around the year [[2000]] and currently runs a [[3d animation]] studio.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about associativity in [[mathematics]]. For ''associativity'' in central processor unit memory cache architecture see [[CPU cache]].''

In [[mathematics]], '''associativity''' is a property that a [[binary operation]] can have. It means that the order of evaluation is immaterial if the operation appears more than once in an expression. Put another way, no [[parentheses]] are required for an associative operation. Consider for instance the equation
:(5+2)+1 = 5+(2+1)
Adding 5 and 2 gives 7, and adding 1 gives an end result of 8 for the left hand side. To evaluate the right hand side, we start with adding 2 and 1 giving 3, and then add 5 and 3 to get 8, again. So the equation holds true. In fact, it holds true for ''all'' [[real number]]s, not just for 5, 2 and 1. We say that &quot;addition of real numbers is an associative operation&quot;.

Associative operations are abundant in mathematics, and in fact most [[algebraic structure]]s explicitly require their binary operations to be associative.  However, many important and interesting operations are non-associative; one common example would be the [[vector cross product]].

==Definition==

Formally, a binary operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on a [[set]] ''S'' is called '''associative''' if it satisfies the '''associative law''':
:&lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z=x*(y*z)\qquad\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in S.&lt;/math&gt;
The evaluation order does not affect the value of such expressions, and it can be shown that the same holds for expressions containing ''any'' number of &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; operations. Thus, when &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is associative, the evaluation order can therefore be left unspecified without causing ambiguity, by omitting the parentheses and writing simply:
:&lt;math&gt;x*y*z.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

Some examples of associative operations include the following.

*In [[arithmetic]], [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of [[real number]]s are associative; i.e.,
::&lt;math&gt;
   \left.
    \begin{matrix}
     (x+y)+z=x+(y+z)=x+y+z\quad
    \\
     (x\,y)z=x(y\,z)=x\,y\,z\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\ \ \,
    \end{matrix}
   \right\}
   \mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}.
  &lt;/math&gt;

*Addition and multiplication of [[complex number]]s and [[quaternion]]s is  associative. Addition of [[octonion]]s is also associative, but multiplication of octonions is non-associative.

*The [[greatest common divisor]] and [[least common multiple]] functions act associatively.
::&lt;math&gt;
   \left.
    \begin{matrix}
     \operatorname{gcd}(\operatorname{gcd}(x,y),z)=
     \operatorname{gcd}(x,\operatorname{gcd}(y,z))=
     \operatorname{gcd}(x,y,z)\ \quad
    \\
     \operatorname{lcm}(\operatorname{lcm}(x,y),z)=
     \operatorname{lcm}(x,\operatorname{lcm}(y,z))=
     \operatorname{lcm}(x,y,z)\quad
    \end{matrix}
   \right\}\mbox{ for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{Z}.
  &lt;/math&gt;

*[[Matrix multiplication]] is associative. Because [[linear transformation]]s can be represented by matrices, one can immediately conclude that linear transformations compose associatively.

*Taking the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] or the [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[set]]s:
::&lt;math&gt;
   \left.
    \begin{matrix}
     (A\cap B)\cap C=A\cap(B\cap C)=A\cap B\cap C\quad
    \\
     (A\cup B)\cup C=A\cup(B\cup C)=A\cup B\cup C\quad
    \end{matrix}
   \right\}\mbox{for all sets }A,B,C.
&lt;/math&gt;

*If ''M'' is some set and ''S'' denotes the set of all functions from ''M'' to ''M'', then the operation of [[functional composition]] on ''S'' is associative:

::&lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)\circ h=f\circ(g\circ h)=f\circ g\circ h\qquad\mbox{for all }f,g,h\in S.&lt;/math&gt;

*Slightly more generally, given four sets ''M'', ''N'', ''P'' and ''Q'', with ''h'': ''M'' to ''N'', ''g'': ''N'' to ''P'', and ''f'': ''P'' to ''Q'', then 

::&lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)\circ h=f\circ(g\circ h)=f\circ g\circ h&lt;/math&gt;

:as before.  In short, composition of maps is always associative.

==Non-associativity==

A binary operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on a set ''S'' that does not satisfy the associative law is called '''non-associative'''. Symbolically,
:&lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z\ne x*(y*z)\qquad\mbox{for some }x,y,z\in S.&lt;/math&gt;
For such an operation the order of evaluation ''does'' matter. [[Subtraction]], [[division (mathematics)|division]] and [[exponentiation]] are well-known examples of non-associative operations:
:&lt;math&gt;
    \begin{matrix}
     (5-3)-2\ne 5-(3-2)\quad
    \\
     (4/2)/2\ne 4/(2/2)\qquad\qquad
    \\
     2^{(1^2)}\ne (2^1)^2.\quad\qquad\qquad
    \end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
In general, parentheses must be used to indicate the order of evaluation if a non-associative operation appears more than once in an expression. However, [[mathematician]]s agree on a particular order of evaluation for several common non-associative operations. This is simply a syntactical convention to avoid parentheses.

A '''left-associative''' operation is a non-associative operation that is conventionally evaluated from left to right, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left.
   \begin{matrix}
    x*y*z=(x*y)*z\qquad\qquad\quad\,
   \\
    w*x*y*z=((w*x)*y)*z\quad
   \\
    \mbox{etc.}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \ \,
   \end{matrix}
  \right\}
  \mbox{for all }w,x,y,z\in S
 &lt;/math&gt;
while a '''right-associative''' operation is conventionally evaluated from right to left:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left.
   \begin{matrix}
    x*y*z=x*(y*z)\qquad\qquad\quad\,
   \\
    w*x*y*z=w*(x*(y*z))\quad
   \\
    \mbox{etc.}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \ \,
   \end{matrix}
  \right\}
  \mbox{for all }w,x,y,z\in S
 &lt;/math&gt;
Both left-associative and right-associative operations occur; examples are given below.

==More examples==

Left-associative operations include the following.
*Subtraction and division of real numbers:
::&lt;math&gt;x-y-z=(x-y)-z\qquad\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R};&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;x/y/z=(x/y)/z\qquad\qquad\quad\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}\mbox{ with }y\ne0,z\ne0.&lt;/math&gt;

Right-associative operations include the following.
*[[Exponentiation]] of real numbers:
::&lt;math&gt;x^{y^z}=x^{(y^z)}.&lt;/math&gt;

:The reason exponentiation is right-associative is that a repeated left-associative exponentiation operation would be less useful. Multiple appearances could (and would) be rewritten with multiplication:

::&lt;math&gt;(x^y)^z=x^{(yz)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Non-associative operations for which no conventional evaluation order is defined include the following.
*Taking the pairwise [[average]] of real numbers:
::&lt;math&gt;{(x+y)/2+z\over2}\ne{x+(y+z)/2\over2}\ne{x+y+z\over3}\qquad\mbox{for some }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;
*Taking the [[complement (set theory)|relative complement]] of sets:
::&lt;math&gt;(A\backslash B)\backslash C\ne A\backslash (B\backslash C)\qquad\mbox{for some sets }A,B,C.&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;div style=&quot;width: 360px; float:left; margin:0em 2em 0em 0em; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;[[image:RelativeComplement.png|Venn diagram of the relative complements (A\B)\C and A\(B\C)]]&lt;/div&gt;
The green part in the left [[Venn diagram]] represents (''A''\''B'')\''C''. The green part in the right Venn diagram represents ''A''\(''B''\''C'')
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Apache Software Foundation''' (ASF) is a non-profit corporation (classified as 501(c)3 in the United States) to support Apache software projects, including the [[Apache HTTP Server]]. The ASF was formed from the Apache Group and [[Delaware corporation|incorporated in Delaware]], USA, in June, 1999.

The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized community of developers.  The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the [[Apache License]] and are therefore [[free software]] / [[open source software]]. The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process and an open and pragmatic software license. Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project. The ASF is a [[meritocracy]], implying that membership to the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects.

Among the ASF's objectives are to provide legal protection to volunteers working on Apache projects, and to prevent the ''Apache'' brand name from being used by other organizations without permission.

The ASF also holds several [http://www.apachecon.com/ ApacheCon] conferences each year, highlighting Apache projects, related technology, and allowing Apache developers to gather together.

==Projects==
Formally recognized Apache projects include:

*[[Apache HTTP Server]]: [[Web server]]
*[[Apache Ant|Ant]]: [[Java programming language|Java]]-based build tool

==History==
The history of the Apache Software Foundation is linked to the Apache HTTP Server, the work on which started in [[1994]]. A group of eight developers started working on enhancing the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications|NCSA]] [[HTTPd]] daemon. They were [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Roy Fielding]], [[Rob Hartill]], [[David Robinson]], [[Cliff Skolnick]], [[Randy Terbush]], [[Robert S. Thau]] and [[Andrew Wilson]] with additional contributions from [[Eric Hagberg]], [[Frank Peters]] and [[Nicolas Pioch]].

The enhanced product called the Apache server was released in April [[1995]]. In [[1999]], members of the Apache Group formed the Foundation to provide support for the Apache HTTP Server. The ASF has a membership of 151 members and approximately 1000 committers as of 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{POV}}
The '''Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990''' is the short title of [[United States]] Public Law 101-336, 104 Stat. 327 (July 26, 1990), codified at {{usc|42|12101}} et seq., [[List of United States federal legislation|signed into law]] on [[July 26]], [[1990]] by President [[George H. W. Bush|George H. W. Bush]].  It is a wide-ranging [[civil rights]] law that prohibits [[discrimination]] based on [[disability]].  It affords similar protections against discrimination to [[Americans with disabilities]] as the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] of [[1964]], which made discrimination based on [[race]], [[religion]], [[gender|sex]], national origin, and other characteristics illegal. Certain specific conditions are excluded, including [[alcoholism]] and [[transsexual|transsexuality]].

==Structure==
The Americans with Disabilities Act, commonly referred to as the '''ADA''', consists of three introductory sections and five titles:
*Introductory Sections
**Table of Contents
**Findings and Purposes
**Definitions
*Main Section
**Title I - Employment
**Title II - Public Services (and public transportation)
**Title III - Public Accommodations (and Commercial Facilities)
**Title IV - Telecommunications
**Title V

==Groups who worked to pass the ADA==
The ADA is notable because many disparate groups, many of which had never worked before, came together for a common purpose. In addition, other [[civil rights]] groups outside the disability community helped. 
*[[AIDS Action Council]]
*[[AIDS National InterFaith Network]]
*[[American Civil Liberties Union]]
*[[American Foundation for the Blind]]
*[[Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit]] (ADAPT)
*[[Association for Education and Rehabilitation of the Blind and Visually Handicapped]]
*[[Association for Retarded Citizens]]
*[[Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities]]
*[[Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund]]
*[[Dole Foundation]]
*[[Eastern Paralyzed Veterans of America]]
*[[Epilepsy Foundation of America]]
*[[Human Rights Campaign]] Fund
*[[Institution for Rehabilitation and Research]]
*[[Leadership Conference on Civil Rights]]
*[[Legal Action Center]]
*[[Mental Health Law Project]]
*[[National Association of Developmental Disabilities Councils]]
*[[National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems]]
*[[National Center for Law and the Deaf]]
*[[National Council of Independent Living]]
*[[National Council on Disability]]
*[[National Disability Action Center]]

*[[Society for Accessible Travel &amp; Hospitality]]
*[[Spina Bifida Association of America]]
*[[United Cerebral Palsy Association]]

==Quote==
On signing the measure, George H. W. Bush said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I know there may have been concerns that the ADA may be too vague or too costly, or may lead endlessly to litigation. But I want to reassure you right now that my administration and the United States Congress have carefully crafted this Act. We've all been determined to ensure that it gives flexibility, particularly in terms of the timetable of implementation; and we've been committed to containing the costs that may be incurred.... ''Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down.''&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Controversy==
===Inherent flaws===
Some critics argue that enactment of the ADA has resulted in little progress in eliminating such discrimination because the remedies allowed under the law are primarily ''complaint-driven''. That is, individuals must make complaints of discrimination to the person or agency charged with handling such complaints, only after which the agency may take action.  Each title of the Act created an agency to handle such complaints, ranging from bodies of the federal [[executive branch]] to local civil rights enforcement agencies.  Further, individuals under each title have the &quot;private right of action&quot;, that is, the right to privately [[lawsuit|sue]] the alleged discriminating person or body.  Many of these lawsuits have helped to clarify provisions of the Act as the courts have interpreted the law in specific cases, creating a body of [[legal precedent]].

===Criticism===
Although it has greatly improved the quality of life for people with severe physical disabilities, the ADA has also been heavily criticized for being overinclusive in its reach.  In turn, the ADA allegedly serves as a legal haven for malingerers and so-called &quot;professional plaintiffs&quot; who make a living out of suing noncompliant businesses and collecting monetary damages.  

The ADA was the target of a vicious media backlash in mid-[[1997]] after the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] published its ADA guidelines in March.  For example, ''[[The Onion]]'' satirized the ADA with an article about the passage of the &quot;Americans with No Abilities Act,&quot; and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ran an episode in which [[Homer Simpson]] tried to become grossly obese so he would be exempt under the ADA from a mandatory workplace fitness program.  

The underlying debate is over whether the ADA should cover people with disabilities that are ''not'' totally and catastrophically disabling.  Most people agree that a person with a severe physical disability like [[paraplegia]] should be accommodated.  But they are less likely to agree when the disability in question is a [[mental illness]], like [[clinical depression]], or consists of minor neck or back pain (see [[neuropathy]]).  Others believe that accommodation laws put too many restrictions on the [[free market]] and should be repealed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Active recall''' is a principle of efficient learning, which says that we need to actively stimulate [[memory]] in the learning process. It is an opposite to [[passive review]] in which the learning material is processed passively (e.g. by reading, watching, etc.).

For example, when you read a text about [[George Washington]], this is passive review.

If you answer a question &quot;Who was the first US President?&quot;, this is active recall.

Active recall is many times more efficient in consolidating [[long-term memory]]. This is why just reading your study notes before exam is not likely to leave a long-lasting memory trace. On the other hand, if you ask your colleague to test you on the same material, the results will be better in the long run.

Because our recall of a memory may be influenced by its position within a sequence of self-test questions it can be advantageous to randomise the order of those questions.  This could be done for instance by putting questions and answers in a [[spreadsheet]] and sorting them by values produced by a randomisation function. [[Flashcards]] are also often used to stimulate active recall in education.
