The '''AGM-65 Maverick''' is an [[air-to-surface missile|air-to-surface tactical missile]] (ASM) designed for close air support, prohibition, and forceful prevention. It is effective against a wide range of [[Military tactic|tactical]] targets, including [[armor]], air defenses, [[ship]]s, ground transportation, and fuel storage facilities.

The AGM-65F ([[infrared]] targeting) used by the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] has an [[infrared]] guidance system optimized for ship tracking and a larger penetrating warhead than the [[shaped charge]] used by the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] (300 pounds (136 kg) vs 125 pounds (57 kg)). The AGM-65 has two types of [[warhead]]s; one has a contact [[Fuse (explosives)#Fuze|fuze]] in the nose, and the other has a heavyweight warhead with a delayed fuze, which penetrates the target with its [[kinetic energy]] before firing. The latter is most effective against large, hard targets. The propulsion system for both types is a solid-fuel rocket motor behind the warhead.

AGM-65 missiles were employed by [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s and [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]]s during Operation [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]] in [[1991]] to attack armored targets. Mavericks played a large part in the destruction of [[Iraq]]'s military force. 

LAU-117 Maverick launchers have also been used on USA navy and air force [[aircraft]]: [[A-4 Skyhawk]], [[A-6 Intruder]], [[A-7 Corsair II]], [[AH-1 Cobra|AH-1W]], [[AV-8 Harrier II]], [[F-4 Phantom II]], [[F-5 Freedom Fighter]], [[F-15 Eagle]], [[F/A-18 Hornet]], [[General Dynamics F-111]], [[P-3 Orion]], and [[SH-2 Seasprite|SH-2G]]; and the [[Royal Air Force|UK Royal Air Force]]' [[AV-8 Harrier II|Harrier GR7]].

      <comment>clarify, AIM-54 is still a missile, just not in use</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AIM-54 Phoenix.jpg|thumb|300px|An AIM-54 Phoenix]]The '''AIM-54 Phoenix''' is a long-range [[air-to-air missile|air-to-air]] [[missile]], carried in clusters of up to six missiles on the [[F-14 Tomcat]], the only aircraft capable of carrying it.

The Phoenix missile was the [[US Navy]]'s only long-range air-to-air missile. It is an airborne weapons control system with multiple-target handling capabilities, used to kill multiple air targets with conventional warheads. Near simultaneous launch is possible against up to six targets in all weather and heavy jamming environments. The improved Phoenix, the AIM-54C, was developed to better counter projected threats from tactical aircraft and cruise missiles.

The AIM-54 Phoenix was retired from USN service on [[30 September]] [[2004 in aviation|2004]].

==Versions==
'''AIM-54A''': The original version to become operational, in [[1974 in aviation|1974]]. 

'''AIM-54C''': Improved version, better able to counter [[cruise missiles]]. Superseded the AIM-54A from [[1986 in aviation|1986]].

'''AIM-54 ECCM/[[Sealed round|Sealed]]''': Improved to include electronic counter-countermeasure capabilities, does not require coolant conditioning during captive flight. Used from [[1988 in aviation|1988]] onwards.

Because the AIM-54 ECCM/Sealed receives no coolant, [[F-14 Tomcat|Tomcats]] carrying this version of the missile may not exceed a certain airspeed.
In recent years, [[Iran]] is said to have developed its own version of the Phoenix.

==Combat performance==
Reports of use of the 285 missiles supplied to Iran [http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0077.shtml] during the [[Iran-Iraq War]], from 1980&amp;ndash;88, vary, with some sources claiming as many as 25 kills with it [http://www.iiaf.net/aircraft/jetfighters/F14/f14.html] and others suggesting sabotage of the aircraft making it impossible to fire the missile or no kills for other reasons. It is generally reported that the primary use of the [[F-14]] was as an [[airborne early warning]] aircraft, guarded by other fighters. However, some insist that this is incorrect and point to the experience of fighting Iraqi pilots during the [[1991 Gulf War]]. Iraqi fighter pilots consistently turned and fled as soon as American F-14 pilots turned on their fighters' very distinctive [[AN/AWG-9]] radars.

The [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)]], in which American F-14s shot down 2 [[Libya]]n [[Su-22]]s is sometimes thought to have involved AIM-54. However, the engagement was conducted at short ranges using the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]. The other US F-14 fighter to fighter engagement, the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1989)]] used [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] and Sidewinder missiles, not the Phoenix.

In training, the Phoenix hit a target drone at a range of 212 km (in January 1979, in Iran).

Actual ranges at which the Phoenix has successfully hit targets in tests:
* longest shot to kill: ~ 140 km
* average engagement ranges: 20 to 70 km
* the shortest shot to kill: 7.5 km

Other than the possible Iranian firings, the only confirmed combat use of the Phoenix was the use of it by 2 F-14Ds engaging [[Iraq]]i [[MiG-25]]s.  Both missiles missed.  One reportedly followed a MiG-25 into the ground that possibly crashed when it ran out of fuel.

[[Image:A10Thunderbolt2 990422-F-7910D-517.jpg|thumb|right|300px|USAF A-10A Thunderbolt II]]
[[Image:Thunderbolt - Closeup.jpg|thumb|right|300px|USAF A-10 Thunderbolt from 1975]]
The '''A-10/OA-10 Thunderbolt II''', nicknamed and universally known as the &quot;Warthog&quot;, is the first [[US Air Force]] aircraft designed for [[close air support]](CAS) of ground forces. It is a simple, effective and hardy single-seat, twin-engine [[jet aircraft]] designed to attack [[tank]]s, [[armored vehicle]]s, and other ground targets. It is named after the [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] of World War II, a plane that was particularly good at the CAS mission.

==Origins==
The A-10 was developed in response to the increasing vulnerability of ground attack-planes as evidence by the large number that were shot down  to small arms fire, surface-to-air missiles, and low level anti-aircraft gunfire druing the Vietnam War. This led to a need for a specialized, heavily armed, heavily armored aircraft. Previous aircraft used in the CAS mission had been bombers or fighters pressed into the job.

On [[6 March]] [[1967 in aviation|1967]] the US Air Force released a request for information to 21 companies. Their objective was to create a design study for a low cost attack aircraft designated A-X, or &quot;Attack Experimental&quot;. In May [[1970 in aviation|1970]], the USAF issued a modified, yet much more detailed request for proposals (RFP). Six companies submitted contestants to the USAF, with [[Northrop]] and [[Fairchild-Republic]]  selected to build prototypes: the [[Northrop YA-9|YA-9A]] and YA-10A, respectively. 

First flight of the A-10 was in May [[1972 in aviation|1972]]. After trials and a flyoff against the A-9, the Air Force selected Fairchild-Republic's A-10 as the winner on [[10 January]] [[1973 in aviation|1973]]. The first production A-10 flew in October [[1975 in aviation|1975]], and deliveries to the Air Force commenced in March [[1976 in aviation|1976]]. The first squadron to use the A-10 went operational in October [[1977 in aviation|1977]]. 715 aircraft were produced, ending in [[1984 in aviation|1984]]. One experimental two-seat version was built.

==Description==
[[Image:Thunderbolt - Formation.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Four A-10 Thunderbolt IIs fly in formation during a refueling mission.]]

===Features===
The A-10/OA-10 has excellent maneuverability at low speeds and altitude, thanks to wide, straight wings. These also allow short takeoffs and landings, permitting operations from airfields near front lines. The plane can loiter for extended periods of time and operate under 1,000 foot (300 m) ceilings with 1.5-mile (2.4 km) visibility. It can fly at a relatively slow speed of 200 mph (320&amp;nbsp;km/h), which makes it better at ground-attack than fast [[fighter-bomber]]s, which often have difficulty targeting small and slow-moving targets.

The 'Warthog' is exceptionally hardy, with a strong airframe that can survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. The aircraft has triple redundancy in its flight systems, with mechanical systems to back up double-redundant [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] systems. This permits pilots to fly and land when hydraulic power or part of a wing is lost. The aircraft is  designed to fly with one engine and a wing torn off. Self-sealing fuel tanks are protected by fire-retardant foam.

The cockpit and parts of the flight-control system are protected by 900 pounds (400 kg) of [[titanium]] [[armor]], referred to as a &quot;titanium bathtub.&quot; Its engine exhaust passes over the aircraft's [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|horizontal stabilizer]] and between the [[twin tail]]s, decreasing the A-10's infrared signature and lowering the likelihood that the aircraft can be targeted by heatseeking missiles. The placement of the engines partially shields them from anti-aircraft fire behind the wings and tail. The A-10 can fly even after the loss of one side of the tail, 2/3 of a single wing, and one engine.

The Thunderbolt II can be serviced and operated from bases with limited facilities near battle areas. An unusual feature is that many of the aircraft's parts are interchangeable between the left and right sides, including the engines, main [[landing gear]], and vertical stabilizers. A built-in ladder allows the pilot to enter or exit the aircraft without assistance. The sturdy landing gear, low-pressure tires and large, straight wings allow operation from short rough strips even with a heavy ordnance load. These also allow the aircraft to operate from damaged airbases. The aircraft is designed to be re-fueled, re-armed, and serviced with minimal equipment. Operating from a forward area is both useful for close air support and necessary due to the A-10's relatively low cruise and top speeds. 

Although the A-10 can carry a considerable weight of disposable stores, its primary built-in weapon is the 30&amp;nbsp;mm [[GAU-8 Avenger|GAU-8/A Avenger]] [[Gatling gun]]. One of the most powerful aircraft cannon ever flown, it fires large, [[depleted uranium]] armor-piercing shells at a rate of 4,200 rounds per minute. The massive shells and high muzzle velocity allow the Avenger to destroy heavily armored [[main battle tank]]s in as little as 6 direct hits. The gun is accurate as well, capable of placing 80% of its shots within a 30 ft. wide circle from a distance of 1 mile while the aircraft is in flight. The chassis of the plane is actually built around the gun. 

Despite the power of the GAU-8, the principal weapon of the A-10 is the [[AGM-65 Maverick]] air-to-surface missile, with electro-optical targeting. The Maverick allows targets to be engaged at much greater ranges than the cannon, a safer proposition in the face of modern anti-aircraft systems. Other weapons include [[cluster bomb]]s and rocket pods. Although the A-10 is equipped to deliver conventional and [[laser-guided bomb]]s, their use is relatively uncommon. A-10s usually fly with an [[Electronic countermeasures|ECM pod]] under one wing and two [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] [[air-to-air missile]]s under the other for self-defense.

===Criticisms===
The A-10 has been criticized for its minimal avionics fit. It was originally intended purely for close air support, for which it was felt that complex electronics would be unnecessary (and would have an undesirable effect on serviceability and cost). Initial fit provided basic communications, a [[RWR|radar-warning system]], and [[TACAN]] navigation, early aircraft lacking even an [[autopilot]]. As [[United States Air Force|USAF]] emphasis shifted towards the anti-armor role, presumably in a conflict with the [[Warsaw Pact]] in Western [[Europe]], where weather is frequently poor, there was pressure for improved sensors and electronics. Fairchild-Republic offered a two-seat NAW (Night and Adverse Weather) variant beginning in 1977, but it was not adopted. Aircraft were eventually upgraded with [[inertial navigation]] and a [[Pave Penny]] laser sensor (marked target seeker) pod that allowed the pilot to detect laser energy for PID (Positive Identification) of an illuminated target. The Pave Penny is a passive seeker and cannot self-designate a target for an LGB (Laser Guided Bomb). However, the A-10 can drop LGBs with the the help of another aircraft (Buddy-Lase) or, when equipped with a targeting pod, Self-Lase.

The A-10 also initially lacked systems to compute target range or impact points, greatly limiting its ability to deliver weapons other than cannon and rocket fire (in direct, visual-range attacks) or the self-guided [[AGM-65 Maverick]] missile, whose own sensors displayed imagery in the A-10's cockpit. Often times this small monitor would provide the only source of imagery for missions that took place in dark environments. Much later in the 'Warthog's' career, the Low-Altitude Safety and Targeting Enhancement (LASTE) upgrade provided computerized weapon-aiming equipment, an autopilot, and ground-collision warning system. The A-10 is now compatible with [[night-vision]] goggles for low-light operation. In 1999, aircraft began to be given [[Global Positioning System]] navigation systems.

==Operational service==
[[Image:Usaf.thunderbolt2.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|An A-10 Thunderbolt II in flight fully loaded with armaments]]

The first unit to receive the A-10 Thunderbolt II was the [[355th Tactical Training Wing]], based at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], Arizona in March [[1976 in aviation|1976]].

A-10s were initially an unwelcome addition to the arsenal in the eyes of Air Force brass. The Air Force prized the high-flying, high-performance [[F-15]] and [[F-16]] jets, and were determined to leave the dirty work of close air support to Army [[helicopters]].

The planes proved their mettle in the [[Persian Gulf War]] in 1991, destroying more than 1,000 tanks, 2,000 military vehicles and 1,200 artillery pieces. Five A-10s were shot down during the war (a number of those by [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka|ZSU-23-4 Shilka]]), far fewer than military planners expected. A-10s had a mission capable rate of 95.7 percent, flew 8,100 sorties and launched 90 percent of the [[AGM-65 Maverick]] missiles.

In the 1990s many A-10s were shifted to the &quot;[[forward air control]] (FAC)&quot; role and redesignated O/A-10. In the FAC role the 'Warthog' is typically equipped with up to six pods of 5 inch (127&amp;nbsp;mm) Zuni rockets, usually with smoke or [[white phosphorus]] warheads used for target marking. They remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation.

A-10s again saw service in the 1999 [[Kosovo War]], in later stages of the 2001 [[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan]] from an air base at [[Bagram]], including [[Operation Anaconda]] in March 2002, and in the [[2003 Iraq War|2003 Iraq war]].  Sixty A-10s were deployed in Iraq; one was shot down near [[Baghdad International Airport]] by Iraqi fire late in the campaign.

A-10 pilots have been involved in a number of notorious '[[friendly fire]]' incidents.  In the [[Gulf War]] of 1991 an A-10 attacked two [[British Army]] [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicles]] (out of 37 parked up), killing nine soldiers. Two [[FV107 Scimitar|British Scimitar]] armoured reconnaissance vehicles were attacked by an A-10 in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]] of 2003.  They were also involved in a friendly fire incident with a U.S. Marine [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle]] at the Battle of Nasiriyah during the opening stages of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Operation IRAQI FREEDOM]].

The A-10 is scheduled to stay in service with the USAF until 2028, when it may be replaced by the [[F-35 Joint Strike Fighter|Joint Strike Fighter]]. Beginning in 2005 the entire A-10 fleet is being  upgraded to the &quot;C&quot; model that will include improved FCS, ECM, and the ability to carry smart bombs. However, the A-10 could stay in service indefinitely due to both its low cost and its unique capabilities which the Joint Strike Fighter simply cannot incorporate such as its cannon, ruggedness, and slow flying capabilities.

==Nicknames==
====Friendly Forces====
The A-10 Thunderbolt II received the nickname &quot;[[Warthog]]&quot; and dates back to Fairchild-Republic's initial deliveries. The name was derived from the report of the main gun, which has a surprisingly low pitch and sounds much like the snorting or grunting of a hog. This coupled with the A-10's lack of aesthetics and &quot;thick skin&quot; earned it the nickname &quot;[[Warthog]]&quot;.

====Enemy Forces====
During Desert Storm, captured Iraqi soldiers referred to A-10 as 'the silent gun'.  The rounds hit their target before the target heard the report of the gunfire.

==Trivia==
The [[GAU-8/A 30mm Avenger Cannon|GAU-8 Avenger cannon]] is said to produce almost the same amount of force as one of the A-10's engines, leading to a persistent military legend that if enough bullets could be carried and fired in a long burst, the plane would stop flying (or move backwards, in some versions of the legend). Using the specs from the [http://www.gdatp.com/products/lethality/gau-8a/gau-8.htm GAU-8/A product homepage], the recoil force of the GAU-8/A is measured to an average of 10,000 [[pound-force|lbf]] (45 kN). While the recoil force is considerable, the cannon is employed only in short bursts to protect the barrel cluster from overheating. Even if both engines were stopped and the jet was gliding unpowered, firing the cannon will not bring it to a stop in midair, only slow it down much in the same manner as if an airbrake was deployed.

Of further note on the impressive cannon recoil force, the A-10's nosewheel gear assembly is situated in the less than optimal off-centre-line position (immediately starboard of the gun). This design feature was necessary to accommodate the GAU-8 in the centre-line position as off-centre placement would result in potentially catastrophic yaw forces on firing the cannon.

The A-10 was the inspiration for the [[COBRA Rattler]] aircraft seen in the 1980s cartoon series GI Joe, as well as the [[Autobots|Autobot]] [[Powerglide (Transformers)|Powerglide]] in the [[The Transformers]].

[[Image:AC-130.jpg|250px|right|thumb|An AC-130, illustrating the port-side armament.]]

The '''AC-130 Gunship''' is an armed variant of the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[C-130 Hercules]]. Manufacturing is a cooperation between [[Boeing]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]].
 
The primary missions of the [[United States Air Force]]'s '''AC-130H Spectre''' and '''AC-130U Spooky''' [[gunship]]s are [[close air support]], [[air interdiction]], and force protection. Missions in close air support are troops in contact, [[convoy]] [[escort]] and urban operations. Air interdiction missions are conducted against planned targets or targets of opportunity. Force protection missions include [[air base]] [[Defense (military)|defense]] and facilities defense.
 
==Equipment==
 
These heavily armed aircraft incorporate side-firing weapons integrated with sophisticated sensor, navigation and fire control systems to provide targeted firepower or area saturation whilst spending long periods flying over their target area at [[night]] and in adverse [[weather]]. The sensor suite consists of a [[television]] sensor, [[infrared]] sensor, and [[radar]]. These sensors allow the gunship to visually or electronically identify friendly ground forces and targets in most conditions. The AC-130U is equipped with the [[AN/APQ-180]], a [[synthetic aperture radar]] for long-range target detection and identification. The gunship's navigational devices include the [[inertial navigation]] systems and [[global positioning system]]. The AC-130U employs technologies developed in the [[1990 in aviation|1990s]] and can attack two targets simultaneously. It also has twice the [[munitions]] capacity of the AC-130H.

==History==
[[Image:AC-130 firing night.gif|right|250px|thumb|Weapons fire during a night mission.]]
* '''First flight:''' AC-130H: [[1966 in aviation|1966]] ''' (AC-130U: [[20 December]] [[1990 in aviation|1990]])
* '''Entered service:''' AC-130H: [[1972 in aviation|1972]]  (AC-130U: [[1995 in aviation|1995]])

The AC-130 gunship has a combat history dating to the [[Vietnam War]], where it replaced the [[AC-47 Spooky|AC-47]] and the [[AC-119 gunship|AC-119]]. Gunships destroyed more than 10,000 trucks and were credited with many crucial close air support missions. During [[Invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]] in [[Grenada]] in [[1983 in aviation|1983]], AC-130s suppressed enemy air defense systems and attacked ground forces enabling the successful assault of the Point Salines Airfield via [[airdrop]] and air land of friendly forces. The AC-130 aircrew earned the [[Lt. Gen. William H. Tunner Award]] for the mission.
 
AC-130s also had a primary role during [[Operation Just Cause]] in [[Panama]] in [[1989 in aviation|1989]] when they destroyed [[Military of Panama|Panama Defense Force]] headquarters and numerous command and control facilities. Aircrews earned the [[Mackay Trophy]] for the most meritorious flight of the year and the [[Tunner Award]] for their efforts.
 
During Operation [[Desert Storm]], AC-130s provided close air support and force protection (air base defense) for ground forces. Gunships were also used during operations [[Operation Restore Hope]] and [[United Shield]] in [[Somalia]], providing close air support for [[United Nations]] ground forces. More recently, gunships played a pivotal role in supporting the [[NATO]] mission in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. The AC-130H provided air interdiction against key targets in the [[Sarajevo]] area.
 
In [[1997 in aviation|1997]], gunships were diverted from [[Italy]] to provide combat air support for U.S. and allied ground troops during the evacuation of American noncombatants in [[Albania]]. Gunships also were part of the buildup of U.S. forces in [[1998 in aviation|1998]] to convince [[Iraq]] to comply with U.N. weapons inspections. Gunships were later used in the [[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] and the [[2003 Iraq War]].
 
====Current deployment====
 
The AC-130H is produced at a cost of $132.4 million U.S. Dollars, and the AC-130U is produced at a cost of $190 million U.S. Dollars (fiscal [[2001 in aviation|2001]] constant dollars).  Currently there are eight AC-130H and thirteen AC-130U aircraft in active duty service.

The AC-130 gunship series is one of the most expensive aircraft ever made due to its unique nature.  In all deployments these aircraft are to be escorted by two [[F-15 Eagle]]s each, flying [[combat air patrol]] due to the value of both the aircraft and its mission.

==Civilian casualties and controversy==
 
The use of gunships in general and the AC-130 in particular has been controversial at times.  Although the onboard systems are effective at identifying targets, it is unable to reliably tell whether those targets are civilians or military.  Incidents of attacks on demonstrations[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Apr2003/n04162003_200304161.html] and weddings[http://foi.missouri.edu/whistleblowing/uswarned.html] have been explained by celebratory firing of small-caliber weapons (e.g., [[AK-47]]s). Further, in combat areas such as [[Vietnam]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]], fighters tend to be mixed with, or are in fact a part of the local population, often claimed to be a deliberate use of civilians as &quot;[[human shield]]s&quot;.  This intermingling of population with fighters means that attacks on military targets risk civilian casualties, since it is impossible to distinguish un-uniformed combatants from noncombatants.

The greater accuracy of attacks from the AC-130 has been claimed [http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/1019/p3s1-usmi.htm] to reduce accidental casualties compared to high-level bombing.

      <comment>[[Emil Artin]] as originator of theorem (presumably)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[abstract algebra]], an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] is called '''alternative''' if (''xx'')''y''=''x''(''xy'') and ''y''(''xx'')=(''yx'')''x'' for all ''x'' and ''y'' in the algebra, that is, if the multiplication is [[alternativity|alternative]].

Equivalently, an algebra is alternative if and only if the [[subalgebra]] generated by any two of its elements is [[associative]]. The equivalence of the two definitions is known as '''Artin's theorem''', after [[Emil Artin]].

For any two elements ''x'' and ''y'' in an alternative algebra another simple identity holds: (''xy'')''x'' = ''x''(''yx''). This is called the ''flexible law''.

Every [[associative algebra]] is obviously alternative, but so too are some non-associative algebras such as the [[octonion]]s. The [[sedenion]]s are not alternative.

Alternativity in algebras is a condition weaker than associativity but stronger than [[power associativity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[economics]], '''arbitrage''' is the practice of taking advantage of a state of imbalance between two or more [[market]]s: a combination of matching deals are struck that exploit the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the [[market price]]s.  When used by academics, an arbitrage is a transaction that involves no negative cash flow at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state.  A person who engages in arbitrage is called an '''arbitrageur'''. The term is mainly applied to trading in [[financial instruments]], such as [[bond]]s, [[stock]]s, [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[currency|currencies]].

If the market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, the prices are said to constitute an '''arbitrage equilibrium'''. An arbitrage equilibrium is a precondition for a [[general equilibrium|general economic equilibrium]].

[[Statistical arbitrage]] is an imbalance in expected values.  A casino usually has a statistical arbitrage in every game of chance played, even though it could lose money on any single game.

== Conditions for arbitrage ==
Arbitrage is possible when one of three conditions is met:

#The same asset does not trade at the same price on all markets (&quot;the law of one price&quot;). 
#Two assets with identical cash flows do not trade at the same price.
#An asset with a known price in the future does not today trade at its future price [[discount | discounted]] at the [[risk-free interest rate]] (or, the asset does not have negligible costs of storage; as such, for example, this condition holds for grain but not for [[security (finance)|securities]]).

:See [[rational pricing]], particularly [[rational pricing#Arbitrage mechanics|arbitrage mechanics]], for further discussion.

== Examples ==
* Suppose that the [[exchange rate]]s (after taking out the fees for making the exchange) in London are £5 = $10 = ¥1000 and the exchange rates in Tokyo are ¥1000 = £6 = $10.  Converting $10 to £6 in Tokyo and converting that £6 into $12 in London, for a profit of $2, would be arbitrage.  In reality, this &quot;triangle arbitrage&quot; is so simple that it almost never occurs.  But more complicated foreign exchange arbitrages, such as the spot-forward arbitrage (see [[Interest Rate Parity]]) are much more common.

*One example of arbitrage involves the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]]. When the price of a stock on the NYSE and its corresponding [[futures contract]] on the CME are out of sync, one can buy the less expensive one and sell the more expensive.  Because the differences between the prices are likely to be small (and not to last very long), this can only be done profitably with computers examining a large number of prices and automatically exercising a trade when the prices are far enough out of balance. The activity of other arbitrageurs can make this risky. Those with the fastest computers and the smartest mathematicians take advantage of series of small differentials that would not be profitable if taken individually.

*If you can buy items at one price at a [[factory outlet]] and sell them for a higher price on an internet [[auction]] [[website]] such as [[eBay]], you can exploit the imbalance between those two markets for those items.

*Economists use the term &quot;global labor arbitrage&quot; to refer to the tendency of manufacturing jobs to flow towards whichever country has the lowest wages per unit output at present and has reached the minimum requisite level of political and economic development to support [[industrialization]].  At present, many such jobs appear to be flowing towards [[People's Republic of China|China]], though some which require English are going to [[India]].

*Sports arbitrage - numerous [[internet]] [[bookmakers]] offer odds on the outcome of the same event.  Any given bookmaker will weight their odds so that no one [[customer]] can cover all outcomes at a profit against their books.  However, in order to remain competitive their margins are usually quite low.  Different bookmakers may offer different odds on the same outcome of a given event; by taking the best odds offered by each bookmaker, a customer can under some circumstances cover all possible outcomes of the event and assure that they receive a small risk-free profit.

*[[Exchange-traded fund]] arbitrage - Exchange Traded Funds allow authorized participants to exchange back and forth between shares in underlying securities held by the fund and shares in the fund itself, rather than allowing the buying and selling of shares in the ETF directly with the fund sponsor. ETFs trade in the open market, with prices set by market demand. An ETF may trade at a premium or discount to the value of the underlying assets. When a significant enough premium appears, an arbitrageur will buy the underlying securities, convert them to shares in the ETF, and sell them in the open market. When a discount appears, an abitrageur will do the reverse. In this way, the arbitrageur makes a low-risk profit, while fulfilling a useful function in the ETF marketplace by keeping ETF prices in line with their undelying value. 

==Price convergence==
Arbitrage has the effect of causing prices in different markets to converge. As a result of arbitrage, the currency [[exchange rate]]s, the price of [[commodities]], and the price of securities in different markets tend to converge to the same prices, in all markets, in each category. The speed at which prices converge is a measure of market efficiency. Arbitrage tends to reduce [[price discrimination]] by encouraging people to buy an item where the price is low and resell it where the price is high, as long as the buyers are not prohibited from reselling and the transactions cost of buying, holding and reselling are small relative to the difference in prices in the different markets.

Arbitrage moves different currencies toward [[purchasing power parity]]. As an example, assume that a car purchased in [[United States of America|America]] is cheaper than the same car in Canada. Canadians would buy their cars across the border to exploit the arbitrage condition. At the same time, Americans would buy US cars, transport them across the border, and sell them in Canada. Canadians would have to buy American Dollars to buy the cars, and Americans would have to sell the Canadian dollars they received in exchange for the exported cars. Both actions would increase demand for US Dollars, and supply of Canadian Dollars, and as a result, there would be an appreciation of the US Dollar. Eventually, if unchecked, this would make US cars more expensive for all buyers, and Canadian cars cheaper, until there is no longer an incentive to buy cars in the US and sell them in Canada.
More generally, international arbitrage opportunities in [[commodity|commodities]], goods, [[security|securities]] and [[currency|currencies]], on a grand scale, tend to change [[exchange rate]]s until the [[purchasing power]] is equal.

In reality, of course, one must consider taxes and the costs of travelling back and forth between the US and Canada. Also, the features built into the cars sold in the US are not exactly the same as the features built into the cars for sale in Canada, due, among other things, to the different emissions and other auto regulations in the two countries. In addition, our example assumes that no duties have to be paid on importing or exporting cars from the USA to Canada.
Similarly, most [[asset]]s exhibit (small) differences between countries, and [[transaction cost]]s, taxes, and other costs provide an impediment to this kind of arbitrage.

Similarly, arbitrage affects the difference in interest rates paid on government bonds, issued by the various countries, given the expected depreciations in the currencies, relative to each other (see [[Interest Rate Parity]]).

== Risks ==
Arbitrage transactions in modern securities markets involve fairly low risks. Generally it is impossible to close two or three transactions at the same instant; therefore, there is the possibility that when one part of the deal is closed, a quick shift in prices makes it impossible to close the other at a profitable price. There is also counter-party risk, that the other party to one of the deals fails to deliver as agreed; though unlikely, this hazard is serious because of the large quantities one must trade in order to make a profit on small price differences. These risks become magnified when [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] or borrowed money is used. 

Another risk occurs if the items being bought and sold are not identical and the arbitrage is conducted under the assumption that the prices of the items are correlated or predictable. In the extreme case this is risk arbitrage, described below. In comparison to the classical quick arbitrage transaction, such an operation can produce disastrous losses.

In the [[1980s]], [[risk arbitrage]] became common. In this form of [[speculation]], one trades a security that is clearly undervalued or overvalued, when it is seen that the wrong valuation is about to be corrected by events. The standard example is the stock of a company, undervalued in the stock market, which is about to be the object of a takeover bid; the price of the takeover will more truly reflect the value of the company, giving a large profit to those who bought at the current price&amp;mdash;if the merger goes through as predicted. Traditionally, arbitrage transactions in the securities markets involve high speed and low risk. At some moment a price difference exists, and the problem is to execute two or three balancing transactions while the difference persists (that is, before the other arbitrageurs act). When the transaction involves a delay of weeks or months, as above, it may entail considerable risk if borrowed money is used to magnify the reward through leverage.  One way of reducing the risk is through the illegal use of inside information, and in fact risk arbitrage with regard to [[leveraged buyout]]s was associated with some of the famous financial scandals of the 1980s such as those involving [[Michael Milken]] and [[Ivan Boesky]].

=== Merger arbitrage ===
Also called [[risk arbitrage]], merger arbitrage generally consists of buying the stock of a company that is the target of a [[takeover]] while shorting the stock of the acquiring company.

Usually the market price of the target company is less than the price offered by the acquiring company.
The spread between these two prices depends mainly on the probability and the timing of the takeover being completed.

The bet in a merger arbitrage is that such a spread will eventually be zero, if and when the takeover is completed.

=== Convertible bond arbitrage ===
A [[convertible bond]] is a [[bond (finance)|bond]] that an investor can return to the issuing company in exchange for a predetermined number of shares in the company.

A convertible bond can be thought of as a [[corporate bond]] with a stock [[call option]] attached to it.

The price of a convertible bond is sensitive to three major factors:

*''[[interest rate]]''. When rates move higher, the price of a bond tends to move lower.
*''stock price''. When the price of the stock the bond is convertible into moves higher, the price of the bond tends to rise.
*''[[credit spread]]''. If the creditworthiness of the issuer deteriorates (e.g. [[credit rating agency|rating]] downgrade) and its credit spread widens, the bond price tends to move lower.

Given the complexity of the calculations involved and the convoluted structure that a convertible bond can have, an arbitrageur often relies on sophisticated quantitative models in order to identify bonds that are trading cheap versus their theoretical value.

Convertible arbitrage consists of buying a convertible bond and hedging two of the three factors in order to gain exposure to the third factor at a very attractive price.

For instance an arbitrageur would first buy a convertible bond, then sell [[fixed income]] [[securities]] or [[interest rate future]]s (to hedge the interest rate exposure) and buy some [[credit default swap|credit protection]] (to hedge the risk of credit deterioration).
Eventually what he'd be left with is something similar to a call option on the underlying stock, acquired at a very low price.
He could then make money either selling some of the more expensive options that are openly traded in the market or [[delta hedging]] his exposure to the underlying shares.

=== Depositary receipts ===
A [[depositary receipt]] is a security that is offered as a &quot;tracking stock&quot; on another foreign market. For instance a [[China|Chinese]] company wishing to raise more money may issue a depository receipt on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], as the amount of capital on the local exchanges is limited. These securities, known as ADRs or GDRs depending on where they are issued, are typically considered &quot;foreign&quot; and therefore trade at a lower value when first released. However, they are exchangeable into the original security (known as [[fungible|fungibility]]) and actually have the same value. In this case there is a spread between the perceived value and real value, which can be extracted. Since the ADR is trading at a value lower than what it is worth, one can purchase the ADR and expect to make money as its value converges on the original. However there is a chance that the original stock will fall in value too, so by shorting it you can hedge that risk.

===Regulatory arbitrage===
Regulatory arbitrage is where a regulated institution takes advantage of the difference between its real (or economic) [[risk]] and the regulatory position. For example, if a bank, operating under the [[Basel I]] accord, has to hold 8% capital against [[default risk]], but the real risk of default is lower, it is profitable to [[Securitization|securitise]] the loan, removing the low risk loan from its portfolio. On the other hand, if the real risk is higher than the regulatory risk then it is profitable to make that loan and hold on to it, provided it is priced appropriately.

This process can increase the overall riskiness of institutions under a risk insensitive regulatory regime, as described by [[Alan Greenspan]] in his [[October]] [[1998]] speech on [http://www.ny.frb.org/research/epr/98v04n3/9810gree.pdf The Role of Capital in Optimal Banking Supervision and Regulation].

===Long-Term Capital Management===
{{main|Long-Term Capital Management}}

[[Long-Term Capital Management]] (LTCM) lost U.S. dollars 4.6 billion in [[fixed income arbitrage]] in September [[1998]]. LTCM had attempted to make money on the price difference between different [[bond]]s. For example, it would buy [[Treasury security|U.S. Treasury securities]] and sell Italian bond futures.  The concept was that because Italian bond futures had a less liquid market, in the short term Italian bond futures would have a higher return than U.S. bonds, but in the long term, the prices would converge.  Because the difference was small, a large amount of money had to be borrowed to make the buying and selling profitable.

The downfall in this system began on [[August 17]], [[1998]], when [[Russia]] defaulted on its [[ruble]] debt and domestic dollar debt.  Since the markets were already nervous due to the [[Asian financial crisis]], investors began selling non-U.S. treasury  debt and buying U.S. treasuries, which were considered a safe investment.  As a result the return on U.S. treasuries began decreasing because there were many buyers, and the return on other bonds began to increase because there were many sellers.  This caused the difference between the returns of U.S. treasuries and other bonds to increase, rather than to decrease as LTCM was expecting.  Eventually this caused LTCM to fold, and their creditors had to arrange a bail-out. More controversially, officials of the [[Federal Reserve]] assisted in the negotiations that led to this bail-out, on the grounds that so many companies and deals were intertwined with LTCM that if LTCM went down, they would as well, causing a collapse in confidence in the economic system.

      <comment>/* Conclusion from evolutionary arguments */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The argument from [[evolution]] is that [[intelligent design]] is not a verifiable scientific theory and is, in fact, [[pseudoscience]]{{ref|openA}}, with evolutionists noting that &quot;IDers&quot; have theological rather than scientific objectives. This argument is based upon the premises that:

# [[Science]], via evolution, provides sound explanations for the [[origin of life|origin]] and [[diversity of life]], and the [[Universe|origin of the Universe]].
# Evolution is commonly accepted by biologists because of extensive testing of its premises and predictions, whereas ID has not been and cannot be tested because of its theistic basis and reliance on a supernatural causer/[[prime mover]].  Thus, ID is neither provable nor falsifiable, two of the key requirements for any truly scientific theory.{{ref|openB}}
# Using the concept of [[Occam's Razor|parsimony]], scientists note that it is far more likely that the universe is a result of naturalistic processes rather than of creation.{{ref|openC}}
# ID lacks consistency except internally, i.e., it is only consistent and logical within the framework in which it operates. ID at its foundation relies upon an unsupported, unjustified assumption: That complexity and improbability must entail design, but the identity and characteristics of the designer is not identified or quantified, nor need they be.{{ref|openD}} 

A common misconception is that evolution is an argument against the existence of God, but evolution does not conflict with a belief in God, in fact, evolution does not deal in any way with the existence or non-existence of a god or gods.{{ref|open1}}  Two examples that illustrate this follow. Many people believe that evolution occurred as scientists theorize, while maintaining a belief in a deity. Evolutionary creationists accept the scientific theories of evolution, but see it as having been guided by a deity.{{ref|open2}}

== Overview ==
The theory of evolution states that due to [[natural selection]] and genetic variation, populations and species undergo genetic change over time.  According to intelligent design, life is too complex to have been a result of evolution, and must have been designed by an intelligent agent, who most supporters believe to be the God of [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic religions]].  In other words, intelligent design claims to be a [[scientific theory]],that stands on equal footing with, or is superior to, current scientific theories regarding the [[origin of life]]{{ref|ov_meyer}}, that can be used to explain the origins of life on Earth.  

The validity of the scientific claims regarding ID have been dismissed by an overwhelming majority of scientists{{ref|ov_over}}, as the theory was proposed by people with religious rather than scientific objectives. This opinion was clearly articulated in Judge [[John E. Jones III|John E. Jones III's]] decision in the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' (2005).{{ref|ov_kitz}}

==Evolutionary Arguments Against Intelligent Design==
===Intelligent Design is Not Science===
The term ‘[[science]]’ refers to the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical world, especially by observing, measuring and experimenting. Being that intelligent design relies on [[supernatural]] phenomena, it does not fit under this category. A scientific theory must undergo what is known as the “[[scientific method]]” to be scientifically acceptable. The scientific method is the process by which scientists, collectively and over time, endeavor to construct an accurate representation of the world. It involves a number of important steps. These are, in proper order:

#observation and description
#formulation of a hypothesis 
#experimentation to test the hypothesis 
#acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis {{ref|idnot_SM1}}

Rather than following these steps, intelligent design has instead reversed them. Supporters of intelligent design began with a conclusion and are currently working to prove it. This presents a number of problems:  

* Beginning with a conclusion has a tendency to skew data and results in an effort to support the conclusion;
* Were students to be taught ID in school, their understanding of the necessity of using the scientific method might be compromised;
* Performing &quot;research&quot; in this manner has led mainstream scientists to refer to the IDers as &quot;[[apologetics|apologists]],&quot; thus the relegation of ID to a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] non-theory.{{ref|idnot_SM2}}{{ref|idnot_SM3}}

===The Definition of &quot;Theory&quot; and &quot;Evolution&quot;===

Intelligent design proponents, argue that evolution should not be the only &quot;theory&quot; taught in public schools. They propose an argument based on semantics, claiming that evolution is “only a theory,” and it should not be favored over other theories.  In addition, the [[Wedge strategy]] of the [[Discovery Institute]], has begun calling evolution a &quot;theory in crisis&quot; as part of its [[Teach the controversy]] campaign.{{ref|theory_wedge1}}

While it is correct to say that evolution is a theory and not indisputable fact (no ''scientific'' theory makes any claim to be fact), scientists take exception to DI's assertion that it is a theory in crisis, noting that with additional fossil finds, and [[DNA]] and [[Genome|genome-mapping]], evolution is far better supported today than it was even twenty years ago.

The second problem is that of the common definition of &quot;theory&quot;, rather than the scientific, is often used to imply that evolution is just an idea.  While &quot;theory&quot; in this sense refers to abstract reasoning and conjecture, the scientific definition of is much more rigorous. 

According to the scientific definition, a scientific theory must be repeatedly tested through the scientific method and accepted by the scientific community.{{ref|theory_def}} While evolution has passed repeated testing thus rendering it a true scientific theory, intelligent design has not. In fact it has not, and ''cannot'', be scientifically tested as its central argument, that life forms on Earth were created by an unknown intelligent agent, introduces supernatural phenomena that can be neither proven nor disproven.{{ref|theory_behe}}

However, the problem lies not just with the definition of theory, but also with that of evolution, which, like so many other words has more than one meaning. Its strict biological definition is &quot;a change in [[allele]] frequencies over time.&quot; By that definition, evolution is an indisputable fact. Most people seem to associate the word &quot;evolution&quot; mainly with [[Common descent|common descent]], the theory that all life arose from one common ancestor. Many people believe that there is enough evidence to call this a fact, too. However, common descent is still not the theory of evolution, but just a fraction of it (and a part of several quite different theories as well). The theory of evolution not only says that life evolved, it also includes mechanisms, like mutations, natural selection, and genetic drift, which go a long way towards explaining how life evolved.{{ref|theory_def2}}

==Common ID Arguments Disproved==
The following are some common arguments against evolution and why they are wrong

===Evolution has never been observed===

Biologists observe evolution occurring all the time, as they define evolution as a change in the gene pool of a population over time. One example is insects developing a resistance to pesticides over the period of a few years. Even most Creationists recognize that evolution at this level is a fact. What they don't appreciate is that this rate of evolution is all that is required to produce the diversity of all living things from a common ancestor.{{ref|no_1}}

Another example is the evolution of [[Salamander|Ensatina Salamanders]] in the Western United States.  One ancestral species in [[Oregon]] spread southward and populated the [[San Joaquin Valley]].  Once the salamanders had spread south and converged into one area, two non-interbreeding species had emerged.  In other words, adaptations to a changing environment as they spread south resulted in enough variation to prevent interbreeding and therefore creating, by definition, two separate [[species]].{{ref|no_2}}

Even without these direct observations, it would be wrong to say that evolution has not been observed. Evidence isn't limited to seeing something happen before your eyes. Evolution makes predictions about what we would expect to see in the fossil record, comparative anatomy, genetic sequences, geographical distribution of species, etc., and these predictions have been verified many times over. The number of observations supporting evolution is overwhelming. 

What has not been observed is one animal abruptly changing into a radically different one, such as a frog changing into a cow. This is not a problem for evolution because evolution doesn't propose occurrences even remotely like that. In fact, if we ever observed a frog turn into a cow, it would be very strong evidence against evolution.{{ref|no_3}}

Evolution has been observed at a microscopic level as many bacteria species have become immune to certain antibiotics that have worked on them in the past. At the same time bacteria of the same species with no immunity are killed by the antibiotics but the immune ones remain to reproduce. This is an example of both evolution and natural selection.

===Evolution violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics===

This statement of an alleged violation shows more a misconception about [[thermodynamics]] than about evolution. The second law of thermodynamics says, &quot;No process is possible in which the sole result is the transfer of energy from a cooler to a hotter body.&quot;{{ref|2LOTA}}  In and of itself, this statement does not appear to have aught to do with evolution. However, the confusion arises when the second law is phrased in another equivalent way, &quot;The entropy of a closed system cannot decrease.&quot; Entropy is an indication of unusable energy and often corresponds to intuitive notions of disorder or randomness. Creationists thus misinterpret the 2nd law to say that things invariably progress from order to disorder. 

However, they neglect the fact that life is not a closed system. The sun provides more than enough energy to drive things. If a mature tomato plant can have more usable energy than the seed it grew from, why should anyone expect that the next generation of tomatoes can't have more usable energy still? Creationists sometimes try to get around this by claiming that the information carried by living things lets them create order. However, not only is life irrelevant to the second law, but order from disorder is common in nonliving systems, too. 

Snowflakes, sand dunes, tornadoes, stalactites, graded river beds, and lightning are just a few examples of order coming from disorder in nature; none require an intelligent program to achieve that order. In any nontrivial system with lots of energy flowing through it, you are almost certain to find order arising somewhere in the system. If order from disorder is supposed to violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, why is it ubiquitous in nature? 

The thermodynamics argument against evolution displays a misconception about evolution as well as about thermodynamics, since a clear understanding of how evolution works should reveal major flaws in the argument. Evolution says that organisms reproduce with only small changes between generations (after their own kind, so to speak). For example, animals might have appendages which are longer or shorter, thicker or flatter, lighter or darker than their parents. Occasionally, a change might be on the order of having four or six fingers instead of five. Once the differences appear, the theory of evolution calls for differential reproductive success. For example, maybe the animals with longer appendages survive to have more offspring than short-appendaged ones. All of these processes can be observed today. They obviously don't violate any physical laws.{{ref|2LOT}}

===There are no transitional fossils===

A [[Transitional fossil|transitional fossil]] is one that looks like it is from an organism intermediate between two lineages, meaning it has some characteristics of lineage A, some characteristics of lineage B, and probably some characteristics part way between the two. Transitional fossils can occur between groups of any [[Taxonomy|taxonomic level]], such as between species, between [[Order (biology)|orders]], etc. Ideally, the transitional fossil should be found stratigraphically between the first occurrence of the ancestral lineage and the first occurrence of the descendant lineage, but evolution also predicts the occurrence of some fossils with transitional morphology that occur after both lineages. There's nothing in the theory of evolution which says an intermediate form (or any organism, for that matter) can have only one line of descendants, or that the intermediate form itself has to go extinct when a line of descendants evolves. 

To say there are no transitional fossils is simply false. [[Paleontology]] has progressed a bit since [[Origin of Species|''The Origin of Species'']] was published, uncovering thousands of transitional fossils, by both the temporally restrictive and the less restrictive definitions. The fossil record is still spotty and always will be; erosion and the rarity of conditions favorable to fossilization make that inevitable. Also, transitions may occur in a small population, in a small area, and/or in a relatively short amount of time; when any of these conditions hold, the chances of finding the transitional fossils goes down. Still, there are still many instances where excellent sequences of transitional fossils exist. Some notable examples are the transitions from reptile to mammal, from land animal to early whale, and from early ape to human. 

The misconception about the lack of transitional fossils is perpetuated in part by a common way of thinking about categories. When people think about a category like &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;ant,&quot; they often subconsciously believe that there is a well-defined boundary around the category, or that there is some eternal ideal form (for philosophers, the [[Platonic realism|Platonic idea]]) which defines the category. This kind of thinking leads people to declare that Archaeopteryx is &quot;100% bird,&quot; when it is clearly a mix of bird and reptile features (with more reptile than bird features, in fact). In truth, categories are man-made and artificial. Nature is not constrained to follow them, and it doesn't. 

Some Creationists claim that the hypothesis of [[Punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibrium]] was proposed by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] to explain gaps in the fossil record.{{ref|tf2}} Actually, it was proposed to explain the relative rarity of transitional forms, not their total absence, and to explain why speciation appears to happen relatively quickly in some cases, gradually in others, and not at all during some periods for some species. In no way does it deny that transitional sequences exist.{{ref|tf1}} In fact, both Gould and Eldredge are outspoken opponents of Creationism, with Gould having stated, &quot;But paleontologists have discovered several superb examples of intermediary forms and sequences, more than enough to convince any fair-minded skeptic about the reality of life's physical genealogy.&quot;{{ref|tf3}}

===Random chance===

&quot;The theory of evolution says that life originated, and evolution proceeds, by random chance.&quot; 

There is probably no other statement which is a better indication that the arguer does not comprehend evolution. [[Chance]] certainly plays a large part in evolution, but this argument completely ignores the fundamental role of [[natural selection]], and selection is the very opposite of chance. Chance, in the form of mutations, provides genetic variation, which is the raw material that natural selection has to work with. From there, natural selection sorts out certain variations. Those variations which give greater reproductive success to their possessors (and chance ensures that such beneficial mutations will be inevitable) are retained, and less successful variations are weeded out. When the environment changes, or when organisms move to a different environment, different variations are selected, leading eventually to different species. Harmful mutations usually die out quickly, so they don't interfere with the process of beneficial mutations accumulating. 

Nor is [[abiogenesis]] (the origin of the first life) due purely to chance. Atoms and molecules arrange themselves not purely randomly, but according to their chemical properties. In the case of [[carbon]] atoms especially, this means complex molecules are sure to form spontaneously, and these [[Molecule|complex molecules]] can influence each other to create even more complex molecules. Once a molecule forms that is approximately self-replicating, natural selection will guide the formation of ever more efficient replicators. The first self-replicating object didn't need to be as complex as a modern cell or even a strand of DNA. Some self-replicating molecules are not really all that complex (as organic molecules go). 

Some people still argue that it is wildly improbable for a given self-replicating molecule to form at a given point (although they usually don't state the &quot;givens,&quot; but leave them implicit in their calculations). This is true, but there were oceans of molecules working on the problem, and no one knows how many possible self-replicating molecules could have served as the first one. A calculation of the odds of abiogenesis is worthless unless it recognizes the immense range of starting materials that the first replicator might have formed from, the probably innumerable different forms that the first replicator might have taken, and the fact that much of the construction of the replicating molecule would have been non-random to start with. 

Finally, one should also note that the theory of evolution doesn't depend on how the first life began. The truth or falsity of any theory of abiogenesis wouldn't affect evolution in the least.{{ref|chance}}

===Many scientists view Intelligent Design as a viable scientific theory===

While the above argument has been offered as a means to establish intelligent design as science, it is clearly untrue.

An overwhelming majority{{ref|overwhelming}} of the scientific community views intelligent design not as a valid scientific theory but as pseudoscience or [[junk science]]{{ref|junk}}. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has stated that intelligent design &quot;and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life&quot; are not science because they cannot be tested by experiment, do not generate any predictions and propose no new hypotheses of their own.{{ref|NAS}}

In fact the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) stated the following in its ''Resolution on Intelligent Design Theory'':

''Recognizing that the &quot;intelligent design theory&quot; represents a challenge to the quality of science education, the Board of Directors of the AAAS unanimously adopts the following resolution:''

''Whereas, ID proponents claim that contemporary evolutionary theory is incapable of explaining the origin of the diversity of living organisms;

''Whereas, to date, the ID movement has failed to offer credible scientific evidence to support their claim that ID undermines the current scientifically accepted theory of evolution;''

''Whereas, the ID movement has not proposed a scientific means of testing its claims;''

''Therefore Be It Resolved, that the lack of scientific warrant for so-called &quot;intelligent design theory&quot; makes it improper to include as a part of science education;''

''Therefore Be Further It Resolved, that AAAS urges citizens across the nation to oppose the establishment of policies that would permit the teaching of &quot;intelligent design theory&quot; as a part of the science curricula of the public schools;''

''Therefore Be It Further Resolved, that AAAS calls upon its members to assist those engaged in overseeing science education policy to understand the nature of science, the content of contemporary evolutionary theory and the inappropriateness of &quot;intelligent design theory&quot; as subject matter for science education;''

''Therefore Be Further It Resolved, that AAAS encourages its affiliated societies to endorse this resolution and to communicate their support to appropriate parties at the federal, state and local levels of the government.''{{ref|AAAS}}

Additionally, a coalition representing more than 70,000 Australian scientists and science teachers called on all schools not to teach Intelligent Design (ID) as science, because it fails to qualify on every count as a scientific theory.  In fact, the opening sentence of their resolution was, &quot;Intelligent design is not science&quot;.{{ref|aust}}

Finally, a parody by the National Center for Science Education (NCSE) of creationist lists of scientists who &quot;doubt evolution&quot;, [[Project Steve]], was created and named in honor of the paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. The NCSE's list only contains scientists named Stephen or variations thereof (Stephanie, Stefan, Esteban, etc.), thus representing about 1% of the total population. Despite this restriction, it is longer and contains more eminent scientists than any creationist list, including [[Stephen Hawking]] as well as both [[Nobel Prize]] winning Steves in science, [[Steven Chu]] and [[Steven Weinberg]]. There are 696 Steves as of 30 January 2006, while the [[Discovery Institute|DI]] poll has 481 signatures.

==Conclusion from evolutionary arguments==

The pimary difficulty with intelligent design is that its goals are to oppose evolution by taking the guise of offering a new scientific theory, and to clearly replace what IDists refer to as &quot;materialism&quot; with theology.{{ref|conc1}}  

However, ID and evolution are not truly comparable as they exist as two distinct views on the explanation of nature.  Evolution deals with science, and ID with supernaturalism.  They are not compatible, and are, in fact, polar opposites, thus ID's attempt to supplant evolution is not likely to deceive an average &quot;objective&quot; observer.{{ref|kitz2}}

That means concentrating on, &quot;Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?&quot; and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do.''&quot; Johnson 2000. Touchstone magazine. [http://www.touchstonemag.com/docs/issues/15.5docs/15-5pg40.html Berkeley's Radical An Interview with Phillip E.

The first thing you understand is that the Darwinian theory isn't true. It's falsified by all of the evidence and the logic is terrible. When you realize that, the next question that occurs to you is, well, where might you get the truth?&quot;...&quot;I start with John 1:1. In the beginning was the word. In the beginning was intelligence, purpose, and wisdom. The Bible had that right. And the materialist scientists are deluding themselves.''&quot; Johnson 1999.

'''ACF Fiorentina''', formerly '''Associazione Calcio Fiorentina''', is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Florence]] (Firenze), [[Tuscany]]. The club's traditional colors were originally red and white but were changed to purple and white in 1928; since then, the club has been generally known as &quot;i Viola&quot; (the purple ones). The club usually plays at the 47,282-capacity all-seater 'Comunale' Stadium &quot;[[Stadio Artemio Franchi|Artemio Franchi]]&quot; (known until 1991 as ''Comunale di Firenze'', which had itself replaced the &quot;Giovanni Francesco Berta&quot; in the 1930s).

==History==
The club was founded on [[August 26]] [[1926]] by the merger of ''Libertas'' and ''Club Sportivo Firenze''. The club won its first trophy in 1939-40 with the [[Coppa Italia]] and its first ''[[scudetto]]'' (Italian championship) in 1955-[[1956]], the club were runners-up in the four following seasons. In the 1960-[[1961]] season the club won the Coppa Italia again and was also successful in Europe, winning the first [[Cup Winners' Cup]] against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. 

In the [[1960s]] the club won the Coppa Italia and the [[Mitropa Cup]] in 1966 and were league champions again in the 1968-[[1969]] season. In 1974 the ''Viola'' won the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]]. Success in the Coppa Italia was repeated in 1975, but from then until the late [[1990s]] the club found itself in the doldrums, culminating in a season in [[Serie B]] (second division) in 1993-[[1994]]. Upon return to [[Serie A]] the club again proved able in the cup competitions, winning the Coppa Italia again in 1996 and 2000 and the Italian SuperCoppa.

2001 heralded major changes for Fiorentina, as the terrible state of the club's finances was revealed; they were unable to pay wages and had debts of around USD 50 million. The club owner, Vittorio Cecchi Gori, was able to raise some more money, but even this soon proved to be insufficient resources to sustain the club. Then, Fiorentina were relegated at the end of the 2001-2002 season and went into judicially controlled administration in June 2002. This form of [[bankruptcy]] (sports companies cannot exactly fail in this way in Italy, but they can suffer a similar procedure) meant that the club was refused a place in Serie B for the 2002-2003 season, and as a result, effectively ceased to exist. 

The club was promptly re-established in August 2002 as '''Florentia Viola''' with a new owner, Diego Della Valle, and was admitted into [[Serie C2]], one of the lower tiers in Italian football. The only player to remain at the club as they began their new life was [[Angelo Di Livio]], whose commitment to the cause of resurrecting the club further endeared him to the fans. Helped by Di Livio, the club won it's regional section in Serie C2 with considerable ease at the end of the 2002-2003 season, which would normally have led to a promotion to Serie C1. However, due to the bizarre [[Calcio Catania|''Caso Catania'']] (Catania Case) the club skipped Serie C1 and was admitted into Serie B. This was only possible because the [[Italian Football Federation]] chose to resolve the Catania situation by increasing the number of teams in Serie B from 20 to 24. In the 2003 off-season, the club also bought back the right to use the Fiorentina name and the famous shirt design, and re-incorporated itself as ACF Fiorentina. Matches were still being played at the Artemio Franchi stadium. 

The club's unusual double promotion was not without controversy, with some suggesting that Fiorentina did not deserve it; however, the club remained in Serie B and managed to finish the 2003-2004 season in sixth place. This achievement placed the Viola in a two-legged [[test match (football)|playoff]] against [[A.C. Perugia|Perugia]] (the 15th-place finisher in Serie A) for a position in Serie A. Fiorentina completed their remarkable comeback by winning the match 2-1 on aggregate, with both goals scored by Enrico Fantini, to gain promotion back to Serie A. In their first season back in Italian football's top flight, the club struggled to avoid relegation, securing survival only on the last day of the season, and avoiding a relegation playoff only on head-to-head record against [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]]. So far in 2005-06, their form has greatly improved, and they are currently in contention for a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] place. The combination of Jorgensen, Fiore and Toni proved to be dominant as Toni scored over 21 goals so far.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Afrobeat''' is a combination of [[United States|American]] [[funk]] [[rhythm]]s fused with [[Africa]]n [[Percussion_instrument|percussion]] and [[vocal]] styles. 

Popularized in [[Africa]] in the mid to late [[1960s]].  Afrobeat's most famous artist was the [[Nigeria]]n multi-[[Musical instruments|instrument]]alist and [[bandleader]] [[Fela Kuti]] who actually coined the term, constructed the musical structure and shaped the political context of the genre. He launched afrobeat in [[Lagos]] in [[1968]].

Afrobeat also had influences from [[high-life]] music, a style of African pop-jazz. Kuti had earlier played this type of music with the [[Koola Lobitos]] band.

There are certain crucial elements to '''Afrobeat''' that would be encountered in almost all examples of the genre:

* [[Big band]]: A large group of musicians playing various instruments (Fela Kuti's band in the 80s ''Egypt 80'' featured 80 musicians);
* Energy: Energetic, exciting and with high tempo, [[polyrhythmic]] percussion;
* Repetition: The same musical movements are repeated many times;
* [[Improvisation]]: Performing without set music;
* Combination of genres: A mixture of various musical influences.
  
Afrobeat originated from the southern part of [[Nigeria]] in the 60s, influenced probably by the American [[free jazz]] movement. [[Fela Kuti|Fela Anikulapo Kuti]] went through experimenting different forms of music - first by highlife jazz, and then other forms of contemporary music of the time and local African harmonies and rhythms, taking different elements and combining, modernizing and improvizing thoae rythyms. 

[[Politics]] is essential to the genre of Afrobeat, since the founder [[Fela Kuti]] was deeply concerned in social criticism to pave way to social change. The message can be described as confrontational and controversial, which can be related to the political climate of most of the African countries in the 60s, which dealt with political injustice and military corruption while recovering from the transition from the colonial governments to self-determination. 

As the genre spread throughout the African continent, many bands took up the style in the 60s and 70s. The recordings of these bands and their songs were hardly heard or exported to outside the originating countries and can be classified rare.

Jazz musicians have always been attracted to afrobeat. From Roy Ayers in the seventies to Randy Weston in the nineties there have been collaborations which have resulted in albums like africa centre of the world by Roy Ayers released on the polydor label in 1981. In 1994 branford marsalis the American jazz saxophonist would include samples of Fela's beast of No nation in his Buckshot le Fonque album.

Afrobeat has profoundly influenced important contemporary producers like Brian Eno who credits Fela Kuti as an influence.

New generation DJs of the 2000s who have fallen in love with both Kuti's material and other rare releases have made compilations and remixes off of these recordings, thus re-introducing the genre to new generations of listeners and fans of afro-pop and groove.

Post-Fela, the Afrobeat scene is spreading and the music seems to have taken root on the global music scene. There is a diverse group of bands influenced by the music operating out of different countries. A  list of Acts to watch would definitely include Femi Kuti (Fela's first son and a saxophonist) and the positive force, Ayetoro (a group led by Nigerian piano player/composer Funsho Ogundipe), Antibalas (All-American Afrobeat band formed by baritone saxophonist Martin Perna) and finally, Tony Allen the man who held the drum chair during Fela's productive Africa 70 phase.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[number theory]], an '''arithmetic function''' (or '''number-theoretic function''') ''f''(''n'') is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] defined for all positive [[integer|integers]] and having values in the [[complex number|complex numbers]]. In other words: an arithmetic function is nothing but a [[sequence]] of complex numbers.

The most important arithmetic functions are the [[additive function|additive]] and the [[multiplicative function|multiplicative]] ones. 

An important operation on arithmetic functions is the [[Dirichlet convolution]].

Arithmetic functions may be studied with [[Bell series]].

==Examples==

The articles on additive and multiplicative functions contain several examples of arithmetic functions. Here are some examples that are neither additive nor multiplicative: 

* ''c''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') - the number of ways that ''n'' can be expressed as the sum of four squares of nonnegative integers, where we distinguish between different orders of the summands. For example:

::1 = 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,

:hence ''c''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(1)=4.

* ''P''(''n''), the [[Partition function (number theory)|Partition function]] - the number of representations of ''n'' as a sum of positive integers, where we don't distinguish between different orders of the summands. For instance: ''P''(2 · 5) = ''P''(10) = 42 and ''P''(2)''P''(5) = 2 · 7 = 14 &amp;ne; 42. 

* &amp;pi; (''n''), the [[Prime number theorem|Prime counting function]] - the number of [[prime number|primes]] less than or equal to a given number ''n''. We have &amp;pi;(1) = 0 and &amp;pi;(10) = 4 (the primes below 10 being 2, 3, 5, and 7).

* &amp;omega; (''n''), the number of distinct [[prime number|primes]] dividing given number ''n''. We have &amp;omega;(1) = 0 and &amp;omega;(20) = 2 (the distinct primes dividing 20 being 2 and 5).

* &amp;Lambda;(''n''), the [[von Mangoldt function]] - ln(''p'') if ''n'' is an integer power of a prime ''p''; 0 for all other ''n''.

      <comment>Revert to revision 39199236 using [[:en:Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation_popups|popups]] - removed irrelevent addition. Article is about fictional substance</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{otheruses}}

'''Adamantium''' is a [[fictional chemical substance]], often a [[metal]].  The name comes from [[adamant]] or [[adamantine]] combined with the [[New Latin|Neolatin]] ending -ium, and  resembles the form of the names of the [[chemical element]]s.  In its classical meaning, adamant referred either to any hard substance, including [[diamond]], or a hypothetical impenetrable mineral; thus, adamantium often refers to a fictional impenetrable element or substance.

Uses of adamantium or similar substances in other works include:
* Several characters in the [[Marvel Universe]] use [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] equipment, or are themselves made out of adamantium. 
* Armor in [[The Elder Scrolls]] games.
* [[Warhammer 40,000]], in which it is used highly by the Adeptus Astartes (Space Marines), in their armour and vehicles. This version of Adamantium is not impenetrable, merely very hard.
* Weapons and armors in [[Ancient Domains of Mystery|ADOM]]. Adamantium ore can also be found.
* Armor in [[Master of Orion II]].
* Weapons in [[Master of Magic]]. Built of adamantium ore, a terrain bonus.
* Handclock of [[Atomic Betty]].
* Weapons and armors in [[RuneScape]]. Adamantium ore and bars can also be found.
* Ores and plates in [[MapleStory]].
* Rope in [[Untold Legends]].
* In the [[Final Fantasy]] video game series to create incredibly powerful weapons and armor, including in [[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy I]] to make that world's version of [[Excalibur]]
* In the movie ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956), the stuctures built by the long-extinct Krell were made of adamantium.
* In the novel ''[[Gridlinked]]'', the protagonists find an artifact composed of adamantium that was a prison for an energy being.  It was commented that since humans only knew how to crystalize the metal that a race who could fashion objects out of it must be much more advanced.
* In the [[Warcraft]] universe, the black dragon Deathwing had adamantium plate scales welded to his body by goblins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Alien and Sedition Acts''' were passed during the administration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[John Adams]]; his signature made them into law on [[July 14]], [[1798]]. They were designed to protect the [[United States]] from &quot;dangerous&quot; aliens. 

==Component laws==
There were actually four separate laws making up what is commonly referred to as the &quot;Alien and Sedition Acts&quot;: 

# The ''Alien Enemies Act'' authorized the president to imprison (or deport) any alien from an enemy nation (one the United States was fighting).
# The ''Alien Friends Act'' authorized the president to deport any alien considered dangerous, in both war and peacetime.
# The ''[[Naturalization Act of 1798|Naturalization Act]]'' extended the duration of residence required for aliens to become citizens, nearly tripling it from five years to 14.
# The ''Sedition Act'' made it a crime to publish &quot;false, scandalous, and malicious writing&quot; against the government or its officials.

==History== 
With war looming against a major power, [[France]], [[Federalist]]s in [[United States Congress|Congress]], in 1798, passed the laws to protect US security. They were similar to (but not as stringent as) laws passed at about the same time in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|United Kingdom]] and [[British North America|Canada]] in response to the threat of subversion by agents of the [[Revolutionary France|radical French government]]. [[Jeffersonian]]s, however, recognized that the laws were to be used as a tool of the ruling Federalist party to extend and retain their power, silencing any opposition. Because most immigrants became Democratic-Republicans, the Naturalization Act's longer residency requirement meant that fewer of them could become citizens and vote against the Federalists. Under the Alien and Alien Enemies Acts, the president could deport any &quot;dangerous&quot; or &quot;enemy&quot; alien—-a law that is still in effect in 2006.

Under the Sedition Act, anyone &quot;opposing or resisting any law of the United States, or any act of the President of the United States&quot; could be imprisoned for up to two years. It was also illegal to &quot;write, print, utter, or publish&quot; anything critical of the president or Congress. (It was notable that the Act did not prohibit criticism of the Vice-President. Jefferson held the office of Vice-President at the time the Act was passed so the law left him open to attack.) While it appears harsh to current Americans, the act was actually much more lenient than the traditional British law of [[seditious libel]]. For instance:

*The act required the defamatory words to be false, and it permitted the defendant to plead truth as a defense, unlike traditional seditious libel law, in which truth actually made the offense greater (&quot;The greater the truth, the greater the libel.&quot;). In other words, as long as someone uttered or published the truth, he could not be convicted under the Sedition Act.

*The act required the defendant to know of the defamatory words' falsity. In other words, someone who uttered a falsehood believing it to be the truth could not be convicted. 

*The act allowed the use of a jury to determine both the facts and the law in the case, unlike traditional seditious libel.

Despite these modifications, however, Jeffersonians denounced the Sedition Act as a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], which granted the right of [[free speech]]. Although the Federalists hoped the Act would muffle the opposition, Democratic-Republicans still &quot;wrote, printed, uttered and published&quot; their criticisms of the Federalists. Indeed, they strongly criticised the act itself, and used it as an election issue. The act expired when the term of President Adams ended in 1800.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]] opposed the Acts, and drafted the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] in protest, calling on the states to, in effect, veto federal legislation. 

Ultimately the Acts backfired against the Federalists; President Adams himself never supported the laws or used them. No aliens were actually deported, and only ten people were ever convicted of sedition. 

Although the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] never ruled on the validity of any of the Alien and Sedition acts, subsequent mentions of the Sedition Act in particular in Supreme Court opinions have assumed that it was unconstitutional. For example in the seminal Free Speech case of ''[[New York Times v. Sullivan]]'', the Court declared, &quot;Although the Sedition Act was never tested in this Court, the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of history.&quot; 376 U.S. 254, 276 (1964).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{distinguish2|[[Antimony|Anti'''m'''o'''n'''y]], a [[chemical element]]}}

'''Antinomy''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;alpha;&amp;nu;&amp;tau;&amp;iota;-, against, plus &amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;mu;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;, law, literally, the mutual incompatibility, real or apparent, of two laws) is a term used in [[logic]] and [[epistemology]], which, loosely, means a [[paradox]] or unresolvable contradiction.

The term acquired a special significance in the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], who used it to describe the equally rational but contradictory results of applying to the universe of pure thought the categories or criteria of understanding proper to the universe of sensible perception or [[experience]] (phenomena).  Reason cannot here play the role of establishing rational truths because it goes beyond possible experience and is applied to the sphere of that which [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcends]] it.

These antinomies are four--two mathematical, two dynamical--connected with
# the limitation of the universe in respect of space and time,
# the theory that the whole consists of indivisible atoms (whereas, in fact, none such exist),
# the problem of freedom in relation to universal causality,
# the existence of a universal being
about each of which pure reason contradicts the empirical, as thesis and antithesis.
This was part of Kant's critical program of determining limits to [[science]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] inquiry.  Kant claimed to solve these contradictions by saying, that in no case is the contradiction real, however really it has been intended by the opposing partisans, or must appear to the mind without critical enlightenment.  It is wrong, therefore, to impute to Kant, as is often done, the view that human reason is, on ultimate subjects, at war with itself, in the sense of being impelled by equally strong arguments towards alternatives contradictory of each other. The difficulty arises from a confusion between the spheres of phenomena and noumena. In fact no rational cosmology is possible. 

It can also be argued that antinomies do not highlight limitations in the power of logical reasoning. This is because the conclusion that there is a limitation is (supposedly) derived from the antinomy by logical reasoning; therefore any limitation in the validity of logical reasoning imposes a limitation on the conclusion that there is a limitation on logical reasoning. (This is an argument by [[self-reference]].) In short, in terms of the validity of logical reasoning as a whole, antinomies are self-isolating: they are like scattered discontinuities within the field of logic, incapable of casting doubt on anything else but themselves.

This carefree position is incompatible with the [[principle of explosion]]. In [[mathematical logic]], antinomies are patently not ''self-isolating'', and are usually seen as disasters for the [[formal system]] in which they arise (as [[Russell's paradox]] in [[Frege]]'s work).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anti-intellectualism''' describes a sentiment of hostility towards, or mistrust of, [[intellectuals]] and intellectual pursuits.  This may be expressed in various ways, such as an attack on the merits of [[science]], [[education]], or [[literature]].

[[Image:nast-intellect.png|thumb|300px|[[Political cartoon]]ist [[Thomas Nast]] contrasts an intellectual with a [[boxing|prize-fighter]].]]

Anti-intellectuals often seek to frame themselves as champions of the 'ordinary people', and as advocates of [[egalitarianism]] against [[elitism]], especially what they perceive as [[academic elitism]].  These critics argue from a perception that educated people form a [[social class]] by virtue of their education: that members of this class tend to talk chiefly to one another, and as such are remote from other points of view, and also that members of the intellectual elite tend to dominate [[politics|political]] discourse.  

Anti-intellectualism can also be used as a term used to criticize an educational system if it seems to place minimal emphasis on academic and intellectual accomplishment or a [[government]]'s tendency to formulate policies without consultation with authoritative and [[scholarly method|scholarly]] study on the issues in question.


== Causes ==

Anti-intellectual beliefs can come from a variety of sources.  These include:

=== Religion ===

Although most [[religion]]s have rich intellectual traditions, many often rely on [[argument from authority|arguments from authority]] that are not indepedently verifiable, along with a somewhat common tendency to reject secular critical traditions. 

The [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] wings of a religion are the most likely to harbor anti-intellectual sentiments, though not all such groups can be described in this way and many pride themselves on their scholarly traditions. 

Some religions have [[doctrine]]s that affirm statements about [[natural history|natural]] or human [[history]], the [[provenance]] of [[sacred text]]s, and other matters that may be investigated by outside [[scholarly method|scholarship]]; this can give rise to conflict. However, religious anti-intellectualism is not confined to hostility against science: When [[bohemianism]] and [[romanticism]] become major factors in the fine arts, religious believers may perceive these trends to be subversive of [[morality]] and call for [[censorship]]. This has been a fairly common theme in socio-cultural trends in the Americas and Europe since the time of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Some would argue, however, that this is just moral conservatism, which is distinct from anti-intellectualism, though the two positions are allied in many cases.

=== Authoritarian politics ===

Anti-intellectualism is often used by [[dictators]] or those seeking to establish [[dictatorships]]. The educated class has often been seen by totalitarian elements as a threat because of the tendency of intellectuals to use logic and reason to question situations they see as unjust. Thus, often violent anti-intellectual backlashes are common during the rise and rule of oppressive political movements, such [[fascism]], [[communism]] and [[theocracy]]. Because many intellectuals refuse to identify with [[nationalism]], they are also commonly portrayed as [[patriotism|unpatriotic]]. 

The most extreme dictatorships, such as that of the [[Khmer Rouge]], simply liquidated intellectuals as a class, while other regimes, like [[Iran]], use a policy of harassment, intimidation and sporadic imprisonment and execution against intellectuals. In addition, intellectuals in countries ruled by authoritarian governments are often subject to popular condemnation and used as scapegoats to divert the anger of the public away from those in power. Anti-intellectualism is not necessarily violent however, and not necessarily oppressive. Anti-intellectual attitudes can be held by any group, including non-violent ones, as well as by individuals who merely disfavor intellectualism and learning in general.

=== Populism ===

[[Populism]] is another major strain of anti-intellectualism.  Intellectuals are presented as [[elitism|elitists]] and tricksters whose knowledge and [[rhetoric|rhetorical]] skills are feared, not because they are useless, but because they may be used to hoodwink the ordinary people, who are conceived of as the 'salt of the earth' and the source of virtue.

In a similar vein, the curiosity and objectivity of intellectuals about foreign countries and beliefs is portrayed by populists as a lack of [[patriotism]] or [[moral clarity]], and intellectuals are often held to be suspect of holding dangerously foreign, possibly subversive, opinions.  This kind of anti-intellectualism is common in the United States and in an extreme form was embodied by [[Joseph McCarthy]], the fanatically [[anti-Communism|anti-Communist]] [[U.S. senator|senator]] from [[Wisconsin]].

=== Corporate culture ===

[[Corporation|Corporate]] culture in modern times has demonstrated a general preference for '[[pragmatism]]', and this is an occasional source of hostility toward learning.  The idea here is that education is a costly and useless distraction from the more important business of making [[money]]. Reading and writing are solitary ventures, and according to this viewpoint these activities do little to make a person more affable or conventional, and does not foster an aptitude for [[marketing]] or acumen for [[investment]] in profitable ventures.  It is feared that intellectuals may acquire [[ethics|ethical]] and [[politics|political]] ideas that may impede business or make its practices distasteful. Scientific and [[technology|technological]] learning may be given a grudging respect; but the [[art|arts]], [[literature]], [[philosophy]], and similar [[culture|cultural]] pursuits are all considered a waste of time at best and subversive at worst.  Those who pursue them are supposed to inhabit an '[[ivory tower]]' of [[academy|academia]], full of grand plans whose practice is seen as impossibly flawed. 

According to this view, education should be a sort of [[apprentice]]ship, rather than being done on the model of [[classical education]] based on [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] [[grammar]] and literature.  The educational [[philosophy]] of [[John Dewey]], founded on these assumptions, has had some influence on education in the USA, although it must be said that Dewey was also a philosopher and an atheist - two qualities guaranteed to raise suspicions among anti-intellectuals.

==Issues within the educational system==

The educational system may serve as a powerful tool for forming the culture of a nation.  In the English speaking world, particularly in the [[United States|USA]] and [[England]], the schools and universities have often been criticized for being overtaken by overtly anti-intellectual trends and hence not preparing the youth properly to be members of society who would  be cultured, prepared for challenging jobs, and capable of independent thought.

====In primary and secondary schools====

In schools there is often seen to be a lack of emphasis on mathematics and the sciences, accompanied by the rewriting of [[history]] curricula to de-emphasize facts in favor of political agendas, which may be either left-wing, such as [[political correctness]], or right-wing [[nationalist]] narratives.  Such critics would say, for example, that not teaching students [[multiplication table]]s in [[primary school]] and not making sure that they learn [[algebra]] by graduation is a blatant example of anti-intellectualism and malfeasance on the part of many schools.  They would similarly criticize allowing students to graduate without learning the key facts about their country's national [[history]], or without having read any [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

Many critics of anti-intellectualism would also suggest the push to teach [[creationism]] (or [[Intelligent Design]]) over [[evolution]] is an example of anti-intellectualism.

=====The demands of youth culture=====

A major preserve of real, though hardly militant or even self-aware anti-intellectualism in the contemporary world is a youth subculture often associated with those students who are more interested in social life or athletics than in their studies.  Such subcultures, often marked by [[cliques]], exist among students of all groups.  Commercial [[youth culture]] also generates a dizzying variety of [[fad|fads]].  Keeping up with the trends is difficult, and their content is frequently criticised by cultural critics of many different persuasions for being simple-minded and pandering to unsophisticated appetites.  Pursuing [[popularity]] has been likened by [[blog]] writer [[Paul Graham]] to a full time job that leaves little time for intellectual interests.

In the current of anti-intellectualism among [[African American]] youth is the perception that focusing on school studies means &quot;acting white&quot;.  Authors associated with this view include [[John McWhorter]], whose book ''Losing the Race: Self-Sabotage in Black America'' (Harper, 2001, ISBN 0060935936) collects narratives and criticizes the cultivation of &quot;[[African-American vernacular English|ebonics]]&quot; as an alternative speech norm, specifically labelling this as an instance of anti-intellectualism.  Conservative commentator [[Dinesh D'Souza]] is also associated with this view. [[Henry Louis Gates]] cited an informal poll in which African-American students in the [[Washington, DC]] area were asked what constituted &quot;acting white&quot;; according to Gates &quot;the top three things were: making [[Grading in the United States|straight A]]'s, speaking [[standard English]] and going to the [[Smithsonian]]&quot;. [http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/gates/lecture.html]  Needless to say, there are plenty of anti-intellectual white students also, especially among the rural contingent and the children of the [[The Theory of the Leisure Class|leisure class]].

[[Image:Astevenson.jpg|frame|[[Adlai Stevenson]] was called an &quot;[[egghead]]&quot; by [[Richard Nixon]] during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952 US presidential race]].]]

====In colleges====

In the realm of [[higher education]] concerns are generally threefold: 

=====Political bias=====
One type of criticism is based upon the perception that university professors and other academicians have increasingly inculcated their own political ideologies into pedagogical interactions and professional research at the cost of the quality, objectivity, and appropriateness of each. This claim is more often made by those individuals on the conservative side of the American political spectrum against political [[liberals]], as understood in a contemporary sense of the term. Whether this focus on the proverbial &quot;ivory tower left&quot; is deserved is, rather unsuprisingly, the subject of much intense debate both within the [[Academy]] and various political spheres.

Generally, these criticisms are brought up against persons working within the field of the [[Humanities]] -- especially a set of the Humanities falling under the large subdivision of the [[Social Sciences]]. Among the fields most contested are [[Women's Studies]], [[Cultural Studies]], [[Ethnic Studies]] or [[race relations|Racial Studies]], some divisions of academic [[History]], and [[Political Science]]. Whether such field-specific attention is deserved is, once again, the subject of much intense debate.

When the criticism of political bias is set in the context of American [[liberals]] vs. American [[conservatives]], as it often is, the dialogue between the two sides can become rapidly polemical. One finds conservative critics called &quot;anti-intellectuals&quot; as they attempt to bring the charge of political bias against various liberals even as the accused liberals are charged with such things as &quot;re-writing history&quot;; the fairness or each party's assertion must be recognized to vary from case to case.

=====Deficient programs=====
Another major concern centers around the perceived lack of general education in college curricula. Critics claim, for example, that college students ought to take more [[humanities]] classes, such as history or literature, along with the requirements of their major. Allegedly, there is also a deficiency of [[academic rigor]] in the university liberal arts programs that are available to students, stemming from the aformentioned political bias, which is said to lead professors to concentrate on trendy and controversial subjects to the neglect of what is considered legitimate art and literature.  

Notably, the [[humanities]] requirements in [[United States|American]] colleges are actually much greater than in many other countries, such as [[Russia]] or [[India]] where [[college]] instruction is focused almost entirely on professional, often technical, preparation.  It may be argued that in these countries it is generally believed [[high school]] education has given a student sufficient exposure to general education topics.

=====Lack of usefulness=====
A third line of criticism, sometimes seeming to contradict the second, is the absence of 'real life' usefulness from the study of humanities. This has also contributed to anti-intellectualism, particularly among those who study, or have studied, [[technical]] subjects.  This is sometimes considered more of a 'rival-intellectualism' rather than true anti-intellectualism, in as much as people who have received university-level technical training have themselves engaged in an intellectual activity of great complexity. An old joke among engineers, encapsulating this viewpoint, is that teaching students literature prepares them to become future professors of literature, and not much else.

== Anti-intellectualism in the United States ==

===19th Century culture===
19th century [[popular culture]] is important in the history of American anti-intellectualism.  At the time when the vast majority of the population was involved in [[manual labour|manual labor]], and most of the population was [[rural]] and engaged in [[agriculture]], bookish education, which at the time focused on [[classics]], was seen to have little value.  It should be noted that Americans of the era were generally very literate and, in fact, read [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] much more than their present-day counterparts. However, the ideal at the time was an individual skilled and successful in his trade and a productive member of society; studies of [[classics]] and [[Latin]] in colleges were generally derided.

The 19th century predominantly valued the self-reliant and &amp;quot;self-made man,&amp;quot; schooled by [[society]] and by experience, over the [[intellectual]] whose learning was acquired through books and formal study.  In [[1843]], [[Bayard R. Hall]] wrote of frontier [[Indiana]], that &quot;(w)e always preferred an ignorant bad man to a talented one, and hence attempts were usually made to ruin the moral character of a smart candidate; since unhappily smartness and wickedness were supposed to be generally coupled, and incompetence and goodness.&quot; Still, there was a possibility for redemption if the &quot;egghead&quot; embraced common mores. A character of [[O. Henry]] noted that once a graduate of an [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] [[college]] gets over being vain, he makes just as good a [[cowboy]] as any other young man.    

The related stereotype of the slow-witted naïf with a heart of gold, which became popular in 19th century stage shows, still reappears in American culture, recently in the [[1985]] novel and [[1994]] motion picture ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.

===Right-wing currents===

====Conservative critiques of academia====
[[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] once remarked that he'd rather be governed by the first hundred names in the phone book than by the [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] of [[Harvard University]], and many other conservatives have displayed similar disdain for [[academia]]. Institutions such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale University|Yale]], and various other prestigious colleges have been portrayed on the right as centers of a radical and anti-American leftism. [[Robert Warshow]] has put forth the hypothesis that the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] became central to American intellectual life during the [[1930s]]: 

:''For most American intellectuals, the Communist movement of the 1930s was a crucial experience.  In Europe, where the movement was at once more serious and more popular, it was still only one current in intellectual life; the Communists could never completely set the tone of thinking. . . . But in this country there was a time when virtually all intellectual vitality was derived in one way or another from the Communist party.  If you were not somewhere within the party’s wide orbit, then you were likely to be in the opposition, which meant that much of your thought and energy had to be devoted to maintaining yourself in opposition.''[http://www.fas.org/sgp/library/moynihan/appa7.html]&lt;!--Moynihan Commission Report, quoted from Robert Warshow, ''The Legacy of the 30’s: Middle-Class Mass Culture and the Intellectuals’ Problem,'' Commentary Magazine (December 1947): 538, footnote 103.--&gt;

Most observers belive that, while Warshow's criticism might have validity when applied to the Depression Era, it is not supportable today to claim that campus liberals form a hidden Communist or otherwise subversive force in America. Still, many conservatives and other anti-intellectuals continue to argue this general point.

====Religious fundamentalism====
Much modern American anti-intellectualism originates from the commonly held view among conservative [[Christianity|Christians]] that [[education]] subverts religious belief. The validity of this view, in fact, was well substantiated by the spread of [[atheism]] and [[Deism]] among the educated during the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and was deep-rooted even before that time. Hence, for instance, the [[New England]] [[Puritan]] writer [[John Cotton]] wrote, in [[1642]], &quot;The more learned and witty you bee, the more fit to act for [[Satan]] will you bee.&quot; 

[[Image:Cartoon.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Political cartoon]] criticizing rural attitudes towards Evolution]]

Many Christian thinkers, while not considering [[education]] an inherent evil, object to some of its perceived un-Christian aspects, for example alleged anti-religious, pro-[[abortion]] and pro-[[gay rights]] propaganda in public schools and colleges. Sex education classes, the study of evolution in biology classrooms, and the promotion of &quot;tolerance,&quot; seen as a code word for officially sanctioned sexual deviance, come in for particular attack from these quarters. A good number regard the public education system as being by and large a system of anti-Christian state indoctrination controlled by atheistic elites.

===Left-wing currents===

====1960s student culture====
Especially in the [[1960s]] many student demonstrators romanticized the impoverished populations of [[Appalachia]] and the [[Mississippi Delta]]. The lack of formal education in these regions was seen as a sort of freedom from &quot;conformist&quot; society that allowed one to lead a more genuine and worthy life. The sanitized version of [[folk music]] that became popular on campus around this time is a related trend. 

The anti-war movement also despised the highly educated but cold-hearted Washington technocrat, epitomized by [[Robert McNamara]], who was alleged to make decisions soley on numbers and probablities and could not see individual lives or deaths as anything but statistics. The Vietnam [[body count]] was offered as an example of this inhuman intellectualism.

Also, some on the extremes of the student movement were heavily influenced by [[Maoism]] which has a strong anti-intellectual component.

====The intellectual as paid apologist for the status quo====

Many on the left have pointed out that the intellectual's status as a &quot;professional thinker&quot; requires the support of a member of the ruling class willing to cut their checks. Therefore, most intellectuals, in order to maintain their profession, must assume a subservient posture towards the current power structure even when their ideas are outwardly &quot;radical.&quot; These critics point out that many a tenured professor has called for revolution, but few have ever taken concrete steps to promote one. This has the effect of discrediting the idea of social change by associating it with hypocritical academics, thereby serving the status quo.

In return for their rhetorical services, so this theory goes, intellectuals are rewarded with the power to set themselves up as the social betters of the proletariat and are given a measure of control over  how normal people live their lives. In addition, when government actions go awry, intellectuals provide rulers with a convenient scapegoat - those who were paid to promote the policy can easily be blamed for creating it. 

Although not a leftist thinker, [[Eric Hoffer]] is closely associated with this view of intellectuals. He compared them to the scribes that directed the constrcution of the Pyramids - seemingly authoratitive figures who were in reality puppets of the Pharaoh.

====Current themes====
More recently Democrats and liberals have become extremely suspicious of the [[neoconservative]] movement, which they often portray as a &quot;cabal&quot; of ivory-tower theorists who cause disaster when they gain power and try to put their abstract ideas into practice. The radical deregulation of the economy, tax cuts at at time of war, and the program to rapidly democratize the [[Middle East]] through military means are cited as examples of this.

Some even believe that neoconservatism is a front for a secret group that follows the teachings of the anti-democratic philosopher and intellectual [[Leo Strauss]].

All of this lends to the portrait of neocoservatism as a sinister party of academics carelessly testing elitist theories on the suffering &quot;ordinary people&quot; of America.

===Economic factors===
In the past five to ten years once-plentiful high-tech and skilled technical jobs have begun to disappear from America, and have been replaced with low-wage service occupations which at most require a high school diploma. Therefore the economic incentive to attend college, where one might be exposed to intellectual ideas, has lessened. There thus exists the potential for increased anti-intellectualism in the future. However, statistics indicate that currently in the United States half the adult population has at least some college experience and one-third of that population are graduates.

===In American political discourse===
America, more than other developed nations, has been accused of suffering from anti-intellectualism, particularly by the [[American liberalism|liberal]] [[literati]] both in the [[United States]] and in [[Europe]].  Such accusations are particularly fueled by the political schism between the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] and [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] parties. The less scrupulous contenders on both sides use the accusation of anti-intellectualism as a rhetorical weapon, but most often it is Democrats that accuse Republican backers of exploiting public sentiments against the values of the cultural elite for their own economic gain.

Many Democrats and liberals claim that [[conservative]] beliefs about foreign affairs or [[economics]] stem from &quot;ignorance,&quot; poor education, and a &quot;lack of awareness&quot; of the substantive issues involved, and as such are anti-intellectual. The liberal position often contends that conservative ideology has a tendency to approach issues such as morality and foreign policy in &quot;simplistic&quot; ways, breaking them down into easily understood confrontations between good and evil. The left views its own ideology as more sophisticated and worldly, and based on an interpretative study of human history. Conservatives have countered by claiming that it is liberals who are the true anti-intellectuals, relying on irrational and over-emotional arguments when debating poverty, [[civil liberties]] and, especially, the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].

====In the media====
In the [[2000 Presidential Election]], the media (particularly late night comics) portrayed Candidate [[Al Gore]] as boring &quot;[[brainiac]]&quot; who spoke in a monotonous voice and jabbered on about numbers and figures that no one could understand. It was also widely reported - erroneously - that Gore had claimed to have invented the Internet. It was the classic stereotype of a pompous, out-of-touch intellectual, and this perception arguably hurt Gore in the election. In the years since, debate between the left and right in America has often centered on the relation of the intellectual class to the public as a whole.

Conservative commentators such as [[Ann Coulter]], [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Rush Limbaugh]] commonly argue that conservative politicians, particularly [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George W. Bush]], have been unjustly attacked by a liberal media as being &quot;incompetent&quot; - this can be understood as an accusation of intellectual snobbery by the media. O'Reilly in particular is well known for having a hostile attitude towards what he calls the &quot;[[Ivy League]] Elite.&quot; The word &quot;intellectual&quot; itself has been used as an insult by many on the right.

Both O'Reilly and Limbaugh, as well as other conservative hosts such as [[Tucker Carlson]], and [[Joe Scarborough]], are frequently accused of having anti-intellectual atmospheres on their shows, evidenced by their frequent interruption of guests who try to put forward complex arguments. Scarborough once commented that &quot;If my guest is allowed to speak uninterrupted for more than 15 seconds, then I'm not doing my job&quot;. 

While some on the left claim this represents a right-wing bias in the American media, other analysts feel it merely shows that the media, in the service of higher ratings, has a tendency to promote argument and spectacle rather than informed debate 

=====Sensationalism=====
Indeed, there is a strong feeling on both sides of the political divide that corporate news focuses too much on soundbytes and headlines, and not enough on in-depth reporting. Researchers have noticed a trend in the amount of coverage newspapers and broadcast networks devote to various subjects: World events and political coverage are receiving a declining percentage of print space and airtime, while crimes, sex scandals, and celebrity intrigue take up more and more space. 

This trend is clearly visible on cable television as well. For example, [[The History Channel]], [[The Discovery Channel]] and  [[The Learning Channel]] have shifted from airing purely documentary and informational content to devoting a large portion of their programming to makeover specials, home-remodling shows, and programs focused on muscle cars and motorcycles.

This is cited as proof of a shift in American media that is undoubtedly anti-intellectual even though it is not rooted in any political or cultural bias.

==Anti-intellectualism in the former Soviet Union==

In the [[Soviet Union]], within the first decade after the Revolution of 1917, the [[Bolsheviks]] generally scorned and suspected the educated as potential traitors to the cause of the proletariat.  Whereas the core of the [[Communist]] Party was well-educated, the people who became local activists and officials in [[government]] and [[industry]] often lacked at least formal education and disdained those who had it.  [[Lenin]] once called the [[intelligentsia]], particularly those who opposed him, &quot;rotten&quot; and &quot;shit&quot;.  The boast, roughly translated as &quot;we ain't completed no academies&quot; (&quot;мы академиев не кончали&quot;) became a byword for the new ruling [[elite]].

Later on, the Soviet government came to see education as important and dedicated great resources to literacy, on the one hand, and higher and professional education, on the other.  However, as a matter of social policy, the government sought to promote the [[working class]] over an intellectual élite.  Accordingly, industrial workers often received greater salaries than university-trained professionals such as [[teacher]]s, [[medical doctor|doctor]]s, and [[engineer]]s.  Moreover, workers were covertly inculcated with the notion that only the manual labor creates real value in the economy, whereas the educated people just sit around writing papers.  Some critics have seen this policy as anti-intellectual.

It must be stressed, however, that the anti-intellectualism of the Soviet political elite was closely associated with the fact that the Russian academic milieu, as a part of the tzarist state apparatus, had been hostile to the 1917 Bolshevik takeover almost by definition; however, when dealing with practical issues such as economic and scientific menagement, the early Soviet regime had to resort to such &quot;bourgeois experts&quot;, therefore the tense relationship between the Communist Party elite and non-Party educated people. It was only during the early 1930s that [[Stalin]] attempted to do away with the old intelligentsia altogether, and to put a new Party one in its stead. Such favouring of ''partinost'' - that's to say a partisan stance towards all matters intellectual - over formal scholarship, no matter how crude such partisan stance happened to be - in the end amounted to a clear anti-intellectual stance.   

The Soviet treatment of science is an example of anti-intellectualism - the triumph of [[Lysenkoism]] in Soviet Russia was a result of political bullying of scientists and the punishment of dissenters rather than the normal scientific process of publishing one's findings. Soviet promotion of this [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] idea has been compared to the recent statements in favor of [[creationism]] by the current American political leadership.

==Anti-intellectualism in Asia - Maoist China and Cambodia==

In [[Maoist]] [[China]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]], a revolutionary transformation of all aspects of life, including education, was attempted.  University education in particular was moved away from the generation of highly specialized experts, who were seen as constituting a self-interested [[social class|class]] divorced from the rest of society, and into the service of the masses.  Training programs were accelerated and connected to the practical needs of productive work and socialist development.  Some universities were closed for several years during the transformation.  At the same time, primary and secondary education were greatly expanded in rural China, and urban students were encouraged or required to spend some time in the countryside, both to teach the peasants and to learn from them.  Critics have charged that the practice of curtailing and transforming university education and sending students to the countryside was anti-intellectual.  In the view of the Chinese government, however, state-funded education should be made to serve first and foremost the needs of the society at large.  A poor country with a mostly rural population, it argued, had more need of general, practical education for many than of highly specialized education for a few.

In [[Cambodia]], a country in which few people have access to formal education (the literacy rate is about 50% as of 2004), the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime (1975&amp;ndash;1979) was generally disdainful of intellectuals and saw many as enemies or traitors (see also: [[Khmer Rouge]] and [[Democratic Kampuchea]]). In some sectors anyone who wore glasses was shot by Khmer guards, as glasses were seen as a mark of education and intellectualism.

==Anti-intellectualism in the classical world==

The [[Roman Republic|Roman]] statesman [[Cato the Elder]]'s public career displayed many traits that today would be considered anti-intellectual.  He vehemently opposed the introduction of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] cultural ideals and models into the Roman republic, believing them to be subversive of traditional plainspokenness and rugged military values.  He urged the [[Roman Senate]] to pass its decree against the newly imported [[Bacchanalia]]n [[mystery religion|mysteries]], which it did in the ''Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus'' in [[186 BC]].  He urged the deportation of three [[Athens|Athenian]] philosophers, [[Carneades]], [[Diogenes]], and [[Critolaus]], who had been sent to [[Rome]] as [[ambassador]]s from Athens, on the grounds that he found the opinions they expressed were dangerous. The Emperor [[Augustus]] also exiled many philosophers.

However, rulers in the ancient in classical world were generally intolerant of anyone who disagreed with them. Anti-intellectualism as hostility by self-identified &quot;common&quot; people, or those that claim to speak for them, against a ''perceived class'' of cultural elites is generally considered a modern phenomenon.

==A loaded term?==

Not surprisingly, intellectuals commonly use allegations of anti-intellectualism as a charge against their critics.  Critics of certain intellectuals in turn argue that &quot;anti-intellectualism&quot; is itself a [[loaded term]].  The term 'intellectual' implies knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence, and thus to be called 'anti-intellectual' can often be perceived as meaning one favours ignorance or [[stupidity]].

Sometimes criticism of intellectuals can take the form of a specific critique of an intellectual's specific field of study or theory.  Not all 'intellectual' theories are correct, and thus an intellectual's beliefs can be disputed without necessarily being against the larger concept of intellectual study.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anti-communism''' is the opposition to [[communism|communist]] ideology, organization, or government, on either an [[ideology|ideological]] or [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] basis. Anti-communism is a catch-all phrase which defines any opposition to communism as a [[philosophy|philosophical]] basis for a political and social alliance.

The term came to have a global meaning during the [[Cold War]], when the powers of [[Western society]] sought to coordinate an opposition to the apparent [[militarism|militarist]] expansion of the [[Soviet Union]]. For much of the period between [[1950]] and [[1991]] anti-communism was one of the major components of the [[Origins of the Cold War#Containment|containment]] policy of the [[United States]].

Anticommunism in Europe is often associated with the struggle for [[democracy]] and [[civil rights]]. To [[Communist]] supporters the term represents [[Fascism]] and other governments that they consider to be as horrible.

==Background==
[[Image:Hitlermusso.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] forged the anticommunist [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] and were the two most notable anticommunist leaders of the 1930s and 1940s]]

Today, many liberal anti-communists object to the lack of individual freedom in [[Communist states]], criticize the way in which the concept of democracy is interpreted by communists very differently than in Western [[liberal democracy]], and critique the socialist economic programs proposed by communists.

Many communists rebut this criticism by saying that democracy is actually essential for a planned economy to prevent what many more left-winged communists call &quot;[[state-capitalism]]&quot;, in which they say a [[dictatorship]] would act just as oppressive to the workers as the corporations in [[capitalism]].

After the [[Russia]]n [[October Revolution]] in [[1917]], critics of communism were inspired to resist communist ideology from a [[conservatism|conservative]] point of view. With the advent of [[Stalinism]] in the [[1920s]], many liberal communists, [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], and [[social democracy|social democrats]] opposed the [[Soviet Union]] for its alleged violations of human rights, thus anti-communism became common on both the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] and [[Rightism|Right]] of the [[political spectrum]].

==Types of Anti-Communists==
The reasons that different people have opposed communism can be very different. Conservative and liberal critics of communism often oppose Marxism or even [[socialism]] in general. They see communism as a doctrine based on radical, and incorrect, arguments. They believe that [[capitalism]] gives economic freedoms to everyone (whereas the communists believe only the [[bourgeoisie]] [''see'' [[Marxism]]] have economic liberties over the [[proletariat]]), and regard the lack of [[property rights]] under communism as a violation of their conception of [[human rights]]. 

Other people oppose communism due to contradictions or errors within the communist theory and gaps between communist theory and practice. Many anti-communists feel that the theory is less objectionable than its adherents' actions in power. Democratic socialists as [[George Orwell]] or [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[anarcho-socialism|anarcho-socialist]] theorists such as [[Noam Chomsky]] see communism as a doctrine whose aims are noble in theory but which fails to attain them in practice.

==Fascism and Anti-Communism==
{{Main|Anti-Comintern Pact}}

[[Fascism]] and &quot;Soviet&quot; [[communism]] are political systems that arose to prominence after [[World War I]]. Historians of the period between World War I and [[World War II]] such as [[E.H. Carr]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]] point out that [[liberal democracy]] was under serious stress in this period and seemed to be a doomed philosophy. The success of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] resulted in a brief revolutionary wave across Europe, in Germany and Hungary in particular. The socialist movement worldwide split into separate [[social democratic]] and [[Leninist]] wings with the formation of the [[Third International]] prompting severe debates within social democratic parties resulting in supporters of the Russian Revolution splitting to form [[Communist Parties]] in most industrialised (and many non-industrialised) nations. The acceptance of the war by the social democratic parties gave the communist parties credibility with many people, as a result of them labelling it as being [[imperialism|imperialist]].

At the end of World War I there were attempted socialist uprisings or threats of socialist uprisings throughout Europe. Most notably in Germany where the [[Spartacist uprising]] in Germany led by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]] in January 1919 failed. In Bavaria, Communists successfully overthrew the government and established the [[Munich Soviet Republic]] that lasted from 1918-1919. A short lived Soviet government was also established in Hungary under [[Béla Kun]] in 1919.

The Russian Revolution also inspired attempted revolutionary movements in Italy with a wave of factory occupations, a strike wave in Britain, the [[Winnipeg General Strike]], the [[Seattle General Strike]] and other radical events.

Many historians view fascism as a response to these developments -- a movement that both tried to appeal to the [[working class]] and divert them from [[Marxism]] and also appealed to [[capitalists]] as a bulwark against [[Bolshevism]]. Italian fascism founded and led by [[Benito Mussolini]] took power with the blessing of Italy's king after years of leftist unrest led many conservatives to fear that a communist revolution was inevitable. Throughout Europe numerous [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] and [[conservative]] intellectuals as well as capitalists and industrialists lent their support to fascist movements in their countries which arose in emulation of Italian fascism while in Germany numerous right wing nationalist groups arose, particularly out of the post-war [[Freikorps]] which were used to crush both the Spartacist uprising and the Munich Soviet.

However, certain anti-communist authors have disputed the view of fascism as a reaction against socialist revolutionary movements and instead stressed what they believed to be essential similarities between communism and fascism in both theory and practice. The noted [[Austrian School]] [[economist]] [[Friedrich Hayek]], author of ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', argued that various modern [[totalitarian]] movements, including fascism and communism, have common philosophical roots, both springing from the opposition to the [[classical liberalism]] of the 19th century. Anti-communists arguing from these positions see it as far more than a coincidence that [[Benito Mussolini]] himself was an enthusiastic [[Marxist]] socialist and a prominent member of the Italian Socialist Party before the [[World War I]], while many philosophical founders of fascism, such as [[Sergio Panunzio]] and [[Giovanni Gentile]], came from a Marxist or [[syndicalist]] background.

With the worldwide [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s it seemed that liberalism and the liberal form of capitalism was doomed and communist and fascist movements swelled. These movements were bitterly opposed to each other and fought each other frequently. The most notable example of this conflict was the [[Spanish Civil War]], which became a [[proxy war]] between the fascist countries and their international supporters who backed [[Francisco Franco]] and the worldwide Communist movement (allied uneasily with [[anarchists]] and [[Trotskyists]]) who backed the [[Popular Front]] and were aided chiefly by the [[Soviet Union]].

Initially, the [[Soviet Union]] supported the idea of a coalition with the western powers against [[Nazi Germany]] as well as [[popular front]]s in various countries against domestic fascism. This policy was largely unsuccessful due to the distrust shown by the western powers (especially Britain) towards the Soviet Union. The [[Munich Agreement]] between Germany, France and Britain heightened Soviet fears that the western powers were endeavoring to force them to bear the brunt of a war against Nazism. The Soviets changed their policy and negotiated a non-aggression pact with Germany, known as the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] in 1939. The Soviets later argued that this was necessary to buy them time to prepare for an expected war with Germany. However, some critics question this claim, pointing out that along with a non-aggression clause, the pact also laid out extensive economic cooperation between the Soviets and Germans, in the form of the [[German-Soviet Commercial Agreement]], providing Nazi Germany some of the materials it needed to build its war machine. This detail is used by the aforementioned critics to argue that Stalin expected the war to be waged solely between Germany and the Western Allies, with the Soviet Union keeping its neutrality while its two greatest enemies fought each other.

Whatever the case, it is clear that Stalin did not expect the Germans to attack until 1942, so he was taken by surprise when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, with [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Fascism and communism reverted to their relationship as lethal enemies - with the war, in the eyes of both sides, becoming one between their respective ideologies.

==Anti-communism in the United States and Cold War==
The first major manifestation of anti-communism in the [[United States]] occurred [[1919]]-[[1920]] in the [[Red Scare]] led by Attorney General [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer]].

Following [[World War II]] and the rise of the [[Soviet Union]] many of the objections to Communism took on an added urgency because of the stated Communist view that the ideology was universal.  The fear of many anti-Communists within the United States was that Communism would triumph throughout the entire world and eventually be a direct threat to the government of the United States. This view led to the [[domino theory]] in which a communist takeover in any nation could not be tolerated because it would lead to a [[chain reaction]] which would result in a triumph of world communism. There were fears that powerful nations like the Soviet Union and the [[People's Republic of China]] were using their power to forcibly assimilate other countries into communist rule, in a new form of [[Imperialism]]. The Soviet Union's expansion into [[Central Europe]] after World War II was seen as evidence of this. These actions prompted many politicians to adopt a kind of [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] anti-Communism, opposing the ideology as a way of limiting the expansion of the [[Soviet Empire]]. The US policy of halting further communist expansion came to be known as [[containment]].

The United States government has usually motivated its anti-communism by citing the human rights record of some communist states, most notably the Soviet Union during the Stalin era, [[Maoism|Maoist]] China, the short-lived [[Khmer Rouge]] government in [[Cambodia]] led by [[Pol Pot]] and [[North Korea]], because those states ended up killing of millions of their own people and continued to suppress civil liberties of the surviving population.

Anti-communism became significantly muted after the fall of the Soviet Union and [[Eastern bloc]] communist regimes in Central Europe in 1991, and the fear of a worldwide Communist takeover is no longer a serious concern. Remnants of anti-communism remain, however, in United States foreign policy toward [[Cuba]], mainland [[China]], and [[North Korea]]. In the case of Cuba, the United States continues to maintain economic sanctions against the island in a policy which is sharply criticized outside of the United States, but which has substantial support in the US, particularly from the conservative wing of American politics.

Due to American trade interests in China, much of the United States foreign policy establishment does not regard China as communist in any meaningful sense. Nevertheless, there is some hostility toward China, particularly among conservative Congressional Republicans which can be regarded as remnants of anti-communism.  For example, national security issues were raised during Chinese state-owned CNOOC Ltd.'s takeover bid for [[Unocal]], an American energy firm. North Korea remains staunchly [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and economically [[Isolationism|isolationist]], and tensions between the country and the US have heightened as the result of reports that it is stockpiling [[nuclear weapon]]s and is generally willing to sell its nuclear and conventional weapons technology to any group that can pay their prices.

==Repression and Anti-Communism==
After the October Revolution, allied intervention troops tried to crush the revolution. In the summer of 1918, some 13,000 American soldiers, 44,000 British, 13,000 French, and 80,000 Japanese were fighting against the [[Red Army]]. In addition, these countries provided significant financial and material help to the [[White Movement]] (e.g., United States provided 500,000 [[United States dollar|US dollars]], 400,000 [[rifle]]s, etc.).

Communist political parties and organizations were actively opposed by conservative governments in [[Eastern Europe]] after the failed communist revolutions around 1920, in [[Nazi Germany]] and German-occupied Europe, in [[Japan]] during [[World War II]], in China by the [[Kuomintang]] in the 1920s and 1930s, in post-war [[Taiwan]] and [[South Korea]], in [[Latin America]] by various right-wing military regimes ([[Augusto Pinochet]] in [[Chile]], [[Dirty War]] in [[Argentina]], civil war in [[El Salvador]], etc), and in many other places and instances.

There was also some anti-communist [[political repression]] in the [[United States]], most notably in the [[Red Scare]] of the 1920s and the [[McCarthyism|McCarthyist]] era after [[World War II]].
Communists and communist sympathizers often emphasize the persecution of their political movement by &quot;reactionary&quot; forces, which they feel is being downplayed by capitalist governments. Anti-communists respond to this by pointing out that communist governments have often used similar methods to deal with their political enemies, including fellow communists (indeed, the repression of fellow communists is often brought up as an argument for the idea that such governments were not actually communistic). Regarding this issue, the opinions of communists are divided: some of them support the actions of those communist governments on the grounds that they were necessary in order to deal with dangerous terrorists and criminals, while other communists agree that such actions cannot be justified and put in question the self-proclaimed communist nature of the governments willing to carry them out.

Little is known about anti-communist massacres after World War II, not least because of the efforts by the anti-communist regimes to cover up such events. Such a massacre happened on the island of Jeju (South Korea) in April 1948. The estimates of the number of victims range from 30,000 to 140,000. Another example is the [[228 Incident]] in [[Taiwan]] in [[1947]], which until recently was considered a taboo subject even in private (although not many communists were involved).

During the Cold War many authoritarian regimes, often supported by the US, used the fear of communism as a means of legitimizing repression or as an excuse to persecute its opponents. [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s [[Chile]], for example, is often cited by critics as an example of this, although others argue that the threat of communism to Chile was very real. The worst case was probably that of General [[Suharto]] in [[Indonesia]] who, using the excuse of foiling a failed Communist coup d'etat attempt, seized executive power and killed about 500,000 people in his mass purges arresting more than 200,000 other people on merely being suspected of being involved with the coup. Most communists, alleged communists and so-called &quot;enemies of the state&quot; were sentenced to death (although some of the executions were delayed to 1990). The alleged or demonstrated complicity of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] with these regimes seriously discredited anticommunism and the pretense of the US to represent a &quot;Free World&quot; in the eyes of critics. Others, however, have argued that extreme measures were needed to prevent the spread of communism during the height of its expansion.

==Criticisms of Anti-Communism==
Proponents of communism in capitalist countries tend to challenge the accuracy of anti-communist claims. A common rebuttal of anti-communism is that communist countries had created a new, non-proletarian ruling class and thus were not in fact communist. This is a view first put forward by [[left communism|left communists]] in the twenties and [[Trotskyists]] in the 1930s, and today it is accepted by the majority of western communists. Indeed, most modern communists do acknowledge failings on the part of communist governments, saying that [[Marxism]] is clearly against these dictators' practices.

Anti-communists respond to these claims by saying that they believe communist states are totalitarian by nature, and that in Marxist theory too much power is given to the state. They point out that several communist governments have existed, but none have been considered democracies. Anti-communists also question if a classless communist society can truly be achieved.

Some anti-communists, particularly those with [[Libertarian]] leanings, extend their criticisms well beyond Soviet-style communism, associating it with any state-run activity beyond the most minimal.  People who support a [[mixed economy]] where some services are supplied by government-run institutions, such as what takes place in [[Social democracy|social-democrat]] countries, resent the association with communism.

Some writers and historians object to anti-communists' comparisons of communism to fascism (under the blanket term &quot;[[totalitarianism]]&quot;, which they believe to be incorrect). They cite historical evidence, such as the fact that the [[Soviet Union]] fought against [[Adolf Hitler]] during [[World War II]] and said that fascism was the enemy of communism (a view that was shared by Hitler himself, who was one of the most virulent anti-communists of the time), while many anti-communists in occupied Europe took the side of [[Nazi Germany]]. Others, however, placed anti-fascism or national independence above their dislike of communism.

Yet another objection to anti-communism which became more widely advanced in the [[1970s]] was that in pursuit of anti-communism, the [[United States]] was conducting a [[foreign policy]] in which it supported people and governments that sometimes egregiously violated [[human rights]], which it saw as lesser evils than communism.  In order to justify these actions, U.S. Ambassador to the [[United Nations]] [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]] stated the [[Kirkpatrick doctrine]] which argued there was a difference between [[totalitarian]] regimes and [[authoritarian]] regimes.

Many staunchly anti-communist regimes have been dictatorial and guilty of egregious human rights abuses, oppression, and sometimes [[genocide]]. These may include Nazis, secular Middle Eastern dictatorships in [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Egypt]], and the [[Sudan]], right-wing military juntas in [[Latin America]], the [[apartheid]] regime in [[South Africa]], anticommunists regimes in the Far East as [[Suharto]]'s [[Indonesia]]. Citing governments like these as evidence, communists claim that much Cold War policy was driven by simple anti-communism and a disregard for problems in nations ruled by anti-communist but undemocratic governments.

Various Western countries, the United States first and foremost, are also often accused of denial of political or labour rights, racism, oppression and violence, support for governments which presided over mass killings, torture and detention of political opponents, or engagement with regimes (usually on the basis of their shared anti-communism) which practised genocide or racial segregation. In [[Italy]], the use of the [[Strategy of tension]] in the 1970's has been widely criticized.

Nevertheless, anti-communists generally believe such claims to be of an &quot;[[Slogan:And you are lynching negroes|and you are lynching negroes]]&quot; variety. They argue that while capitalist governments may have some faults, Communist ones are worse. Many also state that they disapprove of some actions undertaken by anti-Communist leaders, the defeat of communism and Soviet influence during the Cold War was a top priority. Some also believe that it is easier for countries previously ruled by an authoritarian, anti-Communist government to transition into a democracy, while it is more difficult for a totalitarian Communist nation to do so.

The communists take the other side in claiming which government is more flawed, stating that while communist governments may have had some faults, capitalist ones are worse. They also claim that in some former Communist countries, conditions were better before its collapse. An example used in this argument is Russia, which has faced a bumpy transition to capitalism and has a 25% poverty rate.

Ironically, many anti-communists were too focused on the perceived challenges of communism to notice its internal problems, and few anti-communists were able to predict the fall of the Soviet Union even as late as the mid-1980s.

==Notable Anti-Communists==
This section lists a number of significant intellectual, political, and military opponents of communism. Note that there is a certain overlap between the listed categories. For example, many prominent political [[dissidents]] in the former communist countries, like [[Vaclav Havel]], are also renowned for challenging the theory and practice of communist regimes in their writings.

The persons listed are not classified by their own ideological positions from which they opposed communism, and clashes between their views were often no less severe than their opposition to communism. For example, [[neo-liberal]] thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek]] harshly criticized [[socialism|socialists]] like [[George Orwell]], and vice versa, despite their common opposition to communism. Most anti-communists in the [[1930s]] and [[1940s]] were also staunch opponents of fascism; however, during the [[Cold War]], anti-communism did lead some people who had previously criticised fascism to support other anti-communist dictators.

==Contemporary anticommunism==
===Objections to Communist theory===
The central part of [[Karl Marx]]'s communist theory is [[historical materialism]], a methodology for studying history using dialectical reasoning which concludes that human society has grown or evolved through several historical stages due to the contradictions inherent in each stage, with each transition to the next stage involving the overthrow of the existing socioeconomic order. This idea was first theorized by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], but Marx used it to justify his beliefs. Using this method, Marxists conclude that capitalism will be followed by socialism, just as [[feudalism]] was followed by capitalism.  Marxists then suppose that socialism would be followed by communism, which Marx claimed would not be able to be improved upon as it has no contradictions of its own.

Most anti-communists reject the entire concept of historical materialism, or at least do not believe that socialism and communism must follow after capitalism. Some anti-communists question how and why the state is supposed to wither away into a true communist society.

Many critics also see a key error in communist economic theory, which predicts that in capitalist societies, the bourgeoisie will accumulate ever-increasing capital and wealth, while the lower classes become more dependent on the ruling class for survival, selling their [[labor power]] for the most minimal of salaries. Anti-communists, claiming that this argument is equivalent to the statement that &quot;the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer&quot;, point to the overall rise in the average standard of living in the industrialized West as proof that contrary to Marx's prediction as, they assert, both the rich and poor have steadily gotten richer. Communists reply that even during periods of great prosperity, the rich get rich much faster than the poor, and posit that such periods of prosperity are historical abberations and will be wiped out by future crises of production. 

Another reply to this criticism is that the nations who most endorse capitalism today, such as the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]], had a long history of bountiful natural resources, strategic geography, military victory, and technology long before many capitalist intricacies, giving them these benefits today. Similarly, they claim nations such as [[Russia]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Cuba]] had long histories of military defeats, brutal environments, strict dictatorships, and undereveloped economies throughout their histories, making living conditions harsher even after socialist revolutions. 

Communists also argue that the industrialized West profits immensely from the [[exploitation]] of the [[Third World]] through [[globalization]], that the gap between rich and poor capitalist countries (sometimes called the ''North-South Gap'') has widened greatly over the past hundred years, and that poor capitalist countries vastly outnumber the rich ones. The standard anti-communist reply to the latter argument is pointing out the examples of former Third World countries that have successfully escaped out of poverty in the recent decades under the capitalist system, most notably the [[Asian Tigers]]. Anti-communists also cite numerous examples of Third World Communist regimes that failed to achieve development and economic growth and in many cases led their peoples into an even worse misery, for example the [[Mengistu]] regime in [[Ethiopia]] or the [[North Korean]] [[totalitarian]] government. Supporters of Mengistu or Kim typically attribute the shortcomings in their societies to &quot;imperialist&quot; Western meddling. Other communists, such as the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], while agreeing that imperialism harmed these countries, also say that Ethiopia and North Korea were never communist--they were [[Stalinist]], meaning that they were ruled by a clique of bureaucrats who claimed to be acting in the popular interest but actually betrayed it, being more oppressive to its working class.

Many refer to both communism and [[fascism]] as totalitarianism, seeing similarity between the actions of communist and fascist governments. It should also be noted that many modern left-attributed communists, particularly [[anarcho-communism|anarcho-communists]], use these similarities, and actual sayings from Marx himself, to argue that those self-proclaimed communist regimes were not actually following any sort of communism at all. One such quote by Marx to support this simply says, &quot;''Democracy is the road to socialism''&quot;.

Anti-communists also object to the actual practices of communist governments in contrast to the stated promises of communism, questioning whether or not they are truly able to be called &quot;communist&quot;. For example, the view of &quot;human nature&quot; usually expounded by anti-communist [[Objectivists]] is that while an egalitarian society could be looked at as ideal, it is virtually impossible to achieve. They state that it is human nature to be motivated by personal incentive, and point out that while several communist leaders have claimed to be working for the common good, many or all of them have been corrupt and totalitarian. Communists retaliate that &quot;human nature&quot; essentially doesn't exist, since human beings are extremely adaptable with inbred logic and have shown themselves to be able to live in a wide variety of social organizations, some similar to communism, throughout history.

===Anticommunist histories===
One of the most influential anti-communist historians was [[Robert Conquest]] who argued in his works that Communism was responsible for tens of millions of deaths during the 20th century. 

Communist parties (sometimes combined with left socialist parties as workers' parties) which have come to power have likewise tended to be rigidly intolerant of political opposition. Most communist countries have shown no signs of advancing from Marx's &quot;socialist&quot; stage of economy to an ideal &quot;communist&quot; stage. Rather, communist governments have been accused of creating a new ruling class (called by Russians the ''[[Nomenklatura]]''), with powers and privileges far greater than those previously enjoyed by the upper classes in the pre-revolutionary regimes.

It should be noted, however, that many communists do not support or justify such repressive actions. In particular, [[Trotskyists]] have been virulent critics of the policies carried out by Stalin's Soviet Union and other nations who followed the same model. They refer to these nations as [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] rather than communist, and sometimes call them [[deformed workers state]]s. The anti-communists reply that the repression in the early years of the [[Bolshevik]] regime, while not as extreme as that during Stalin's reign, was still severe by any reasonable standards, citing the examples such as [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]'s secret police, which eliminated numerous political opponents by extrajudicial executions, and the brutal crushing of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and [[Tambov rebellion]]. According to them, [[Trotsky]] could hardly claim any moral high ground, having been one of the top-ranking Bolshevik leaders during these events. Trotsky was later to claim (unconvincingly) that the Kronstadt rebels were early harbingers of the bureaucratisation which he associated with Stalinism.

Anti-communists will likewise argue that the contemporary communist/Marxist claim that any communist regime that perpetuated human rights abuses was not a &quot;true&quot; communist state is merely a convenient excuse that can be evoked to avoid taking responsibility (and thus a version of the [[No true Scotsman]] logical fallacy).

===Economic performance of communist governments===
Communist supporters may point to the fact that those countries were far behind the West to begin with, and they may argue that communist governments have in fact reduced this pre-existing gap. Also, they often point to [[Cuba]], whose economic performance was arguably better than that of the neighboring countries. During the 1990's, however, Cuba suffered a debilitating economic crisis following the loss of her major trading partners (most notably the Soviet Union), and was forced to allow foreign investments in the tourism market as a means of recovery. Critics of the Cuban government under [[Fidel Castro]] argue that the Cuban Cold War trading arrangements with the USSR amounted to little more than a direct Soviet subsidy to the regime, and that prior to the ascension of Castro, Cuba was actually among the &quot;richest&quot; Latin American countries.

In other cases, such as the separated nations, [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]] and [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]], the capitalist portion has advanced far ahead of its communist counterpart. In the case of East Germany, communists claim that they received the &quot;raw end of the deal,&quot; since all the traditional industrial and commercial centers lay in the capitalist part of the country. In addition, in this case, the [[Soviet Union]] removed plant and other resources, claiming them as [[reparations]]. Similar conditions distinguished North and South Korea, with the former suffering under an American-led bombing campaign between 1950 and 1952 that reduced every industrial center above the 38th parallel to uniform rubble, while the latter was spared devestation to the same extent. Also, the anti-communists cite the example of [[Czechoslovakia]], which was among world's most developed industrial countries prior to [[World War II]], but fell far behind the Western nations under the Communist rule.

The hallmark of some Communist economic policies, [[collective farming]], has sometimes been called economically inefficient and often disastrous, especially in the cases of the former Soviet Union, China, and North Korea.

In general, anti-communist economic criticism centers on the belief that communists ignore the realities of economic life and production in favor of their ideas about how things ought to be done. Anti-communists believe that this leads to economic disruption and poverty and generally see the examples of former Communist nations as supporting the veracity of their views.

===Anarchist anti-Communism===
The anarchist critique of communism comes from a different angle. Anarchists agree with communists that capitalism is a tool for oppression, that it is unjust and that it should be destroyed, one way or another. Anarchists, however, go on to say that ''all'' centralized or coercive power (as opposed to just wealth) is ultimately injurious to the individual. Therefore, the concepts of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], state ownership of the means of production, and other similar tendencies within Marxist thought are anathema to an anarchist, regardless of whether the state in question is democratic. There are, also, strong anti-anarchist tendencies among Marxists, who have been denounced variously as unscientific, romantic, or bourgeois.

The debates between [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and Karl Marx are well-known. While Bakunin's own philosophy owed much to Marx's critique of capitalism, their views diverged sharply over questions of how a post-capitalistic society should be organized. Bakunin saw the Marxist State as simply another form of oppression: &quot;The question arises, if the proletariat is ruling, over whom will it rule? This means there will remain another proletariat which will be subordinated to this new domination, this new state.&quot; He loathed the idea of a vanguard party ruling the masses from above, quipping that &quot;when the people are being beaten with a stick, they are not much happier if it is called 'the People's Stick.'&quot;

[[Image:RCP-burn.jpg|right|thumb|An anarchist-made image depicting a flaming flag representing the [[Revolutionary Communist Party, USA]].]]

Anarchists initially rejoiced over the 1917 revolution as an example of workers taking power for themselves, and indeed played a part in the revolution. It quickly became evident, however, that the communists and the anarchists had very different ideas regarding the kind of society they wanted to build there. Anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] went to Russia enthusiastic about the revolution, but left sorely disappointed, and began to write her book ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]''. Anarchist [[Victor Serge]], in response to the pro-Leninist sentiment in the global Left, said, &quot;All right, I can see the broken eggs. Now where's this omelette of yours?&quot;

Anarchists often cite the crushing of the [[Kronstadt Rebellion]], in which the Red Army defeated an embryonic anarchist commune, as a specific example of the tyranny they perceived in the Bolshevik government. The [[typhus]] epidemic, and subsequent crushing of [[Nestor Makhno]]'s weakened black army in the [[Ukraine]] was also a specifically controversial action of the early Bolsheviks.

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], a pro-Soviet Communist Party gained considerable influence due to the necessity of aid from the Soviet Union. Communists and liberals on the Republican side fought mainly against the [[Falange]] fascists, but also put some effort against the [[anarchist]] [[Spanish Revolution]], ostensibly to bolster the anti-Fascist front (the anarchist response was, &quot;The revolution and the war are inseperable&quot;). The most dramatic action against the anarchists was in May of 1937, when Communist-led police forces attempted to take over a [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]-run telephone building in [[Barcelona]]. The telephone workers fought back, setting up barricades and surrounding the Communist &quot;[[Lenin Barracks]].&quot; Five days of street fighting in the [[Barcelona May Days]] ensued. The enmity between anarchists at communists reached a new high, and remained there.

Bitter feelings between anarchists and communists are apparent even today in revolutionary circles. Much conflict and arguing occurs as it did in the 19th century between Marx and Bakunin. However, in recent times, anarchists and communists often join in protest (at least for pragmatic purposes) on certain issues, such as the recent [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

An '''anomalous phenomenon''' is an observed [[phenomenon]] for which there is no suitable scientific explanation. Because they don't fit in the established framework, they are the subject of much controversy. While some phenomena aren't widely accepted as real phenomena by mainstream scientists, calling their study pseudoscience, other phenomena are acknowledged as being a reality, but then its interpretation is what causes controversy. For example, many believe that the phenomenon of UFOs is real, but their speculations differ as to exactly what such objects actually are.

==Examples of Anomalous phenomena==

Some examples of anomalous phenomena are:

*[[out-of-body experience]]s
*[[near-death experience]]s
*[[extrasensory perception]]
*[[ghost]]s 
*[[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s 
*[[Abduction Phenomenon|alien abduction]] experiences 
*[[twin connection]]s

As the framework of scientific knowledge expands, some anomalies get explained logically, losing their status as unexplained phenomena. For instance, while the idea of stones falling from the sky was long ridiculed, [[meteorite]]s are now acknowledged and well understood.

Though actually a subcategory of anomalous phenomena, '''paranormal phenomena''' are studied in the field of [[parapsychology]], and can be divided into three main classes:

* Mental phenomena: unusual mental states or abilities, such as [[telepathy]], [[clairvoyance]] and [[precognition]]

* Physical phenomena: unusual physical occurrences that may be controlled by a conscious entity, as in the cases of [[psychokinesis]], [[poltergeist]]s, [[stigmata]] or [[materialization (parapsychology)|materialization]]s
* [[Out-of-body experience]]s (OBEs) and [[near-death experience]]s (NDEs)

==Written works==

* [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[civilization]] included unique signs and prodigies of [[nature]] in works of [[paradoxography]] such as ''The Phaenomena'' (240 BC) by [[Aratus]] of Soli.
* [[Inoue Enryo]], a [[Japan]]ese [[education|educator]] and [[philosophy|philosopher]], authored the six-volume ''[[The Study of Yokai|The Study of Y&amp;#333;kai]]'' (&amp;#22934;&amp;#24618;&amp;#23398;). As a result, he was best known as [[ghost|Dr. Ghost]] (&amp;#12362;&amp;#21270;&amp;#12369;&amp;#21338;&amp;#22763;) or [[yokai|Dr. Y&amp;#333;kai]] (&amp;#22934;&amp;#24618;&amp;#21338;&amp;#22763;).
* [[Charles Fort]], in his four works on anomalies, lambasted and ridiculed the scientists of his day for their shortsightedness. Some of the anomalies listed in his work have been explained and incorporated into modern science (e.g. [[meteor]]s), while others continue to be unexplained.
* [[William R. Corliss]]' ''Science Frontiers'' has covered reports in the [[scientific literature]] regarding anomalies for years. He, through his Sourcebook Project, has published a large body of reports collected in many of the scientific disciplines.
* [[Leonard George]], a [[psychologist]] who specializes in anomalous phenomena, compiled an authoritative encyclopedia of unusual experiences, activities, and beliefs in his [[1995]] book ''[[Leonard George|Alternative Realities]]''. 
* ''[[Fortean Times]]'', a British monthly magazine, continues in the spirit of Fort's work by publishing reports of anomalous phenomena and longer investigative articles.
* The ''[[The Anomalist|Anomalist]]'', edited by Patrick Huyghe and Dennis Stacy, is another magazine/journal devoted to the study of anomalies (which may be called anomalistics).
* ''[[Strange Magazine]]'' is another magazine devoted to the study of anomalies in the spirit of Fort's work.
* ''[[Fate Magazine]],'' with the slogan &quot;True Reports of the Strange and Unknown&quot; has been published continuously since 1948, and is the longest-running publication of its kind.

[[Image:Georgia_Aquarium_Tropical_Tank.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A tropical display tank at the [[Georgia Aquarium]]]]
An '''aquarium''' (plural ''aquariums'' or ''aquaria'') is a [[vivarium]], usually contained in a clear-sided container (typically constructed of [[glass]] or high-strength [[plastic]]) in which [[water]]-dwelling [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s (usually [[fish]], and sometimes [[invertebrate]]s, as well as [[amphibian]]s, [[marine mammal]]s, and [[reptile]]s) are kept in captivity, often for public display; or it is an establishment featuring such displays. Aquarium keeping is a popular [[hobby]] around the world, with about 60 million enthusiasts worldwide. From the 1850s, when the predecessor of the modern aquarium was first developed as a novel [[curiosity]], the ranks of aquarists have swelled as more sophisticated systems including lighting and filtration systems were developed to keep aquarium fish healthy. Public aquaria reproduce the home aquarist's hobby on a grand scale — the [[Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan|Osaka Aquarium]], for example, boasts a tank of 5,400 m&amp;sup3; (1.4 million U.S. gallons) and a collection of about 580 species of aquatic life.

A wide variety of aquaria are now kept by hobbyists, ranging from a simple bowl housing a single fish to complex simulated ecosystems with carefully engineered support systems. Aquaria are usually classified as containing fresh or salt water, at tropical or cold water [[temperature]]s. These characteristics, and others, determine the type of fish and other inhabitants that can survive and thrive in the aquarium. Inhabitants for aquaria are often collected from the wild, although there is a growing list of [[organism]]s that are bred in captivity for supply to the aquarium trade.

The careful aquarist dedicates considerable effort to maintaining a tank [[ecology]] that mimics its inhabitants' natural habitat. Controlling [[water quality]] includes managing the inflow and outflow of nutrients, most notably the management of [[waste]] produced by tank inhabitants. The [[nitrogen cycle]] describes the flow of nitrogen from input via food, through toxic nitrogenous waste produced by tank inhabitants, to metabolism to less toxic compounds by beneficial [[bacterium|bacteria]] populations. Other components in maintaining a suitable aquarium environment include appropriate species selection, management of biological loading, and good physical design.

==History and development==
===Etymology===
The word aquarium itself is taken directly from the latin ''aqua'', meaning water, with the suffix ''-rium'', meaning &quot;place&quot; or &quot;building&quot;.
===Ancient practices===
[[Image:Goldfish2.cropped.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Koi have been kept in decorative ponds for centuries in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Japan]].]]
The keeping of fish in confined or artificial environments is a practice with deep roots in history. Ancient [[Sumer]]ians were known to keep wild-caught fish in [[pond]]s, before preparing them for meals. In [[China]], [[selective breeding]] of [[carp]] into today's popular [[koi]] and [[goldfish]] is believed to have begun over 2,000 years ago. Depictions of the sacred fish of [[Oxyrhynchus]] kept in captivity in rectangular temple pools have been found in [[ancient Egypt]]ian art. Many other cultures also have a history of keeping fish for both functional and decorative purposes. The Chinese brought goldfish indoors during the [[Song dynasty]] to enjoy them in large ceramic vessels.

===Glass enclosures===
The concept of an aquarium, designed for the observation of fish in an enclosed, transparent tank to be kept indoors, emerged more recently. However, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact date of this development. In 1665 the diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] recorded seeing in [[London]] &quot;a fine rarity, of fishes kept in a glass of water, that will live so forever, and finely marked they are, being foreign.&quot; The fish observed by Pepys were likely to have been the [[paradise fish]], ''Macropodus opercularis'', a familiar garden fish in [[Canton, China]], where the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] was then trading. In the 18th century, the [[biology|biologist]] [[Abraham Trembley]] kept [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] found in the garden canals of the Bentinck residence 'Sorgvliet' in the [[Netherlands]], in large cylindrical glass vessels for study. The concept of keeping aquatic life in glass containers, then, dates to at latest this period.

===Popularization===
The keeping of fish in an aquarium first became a popular [[hobby]] in Britain only after ornate aquaria in cast-iron frames were featured at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851. The framed-glass aquarium was a specialized version of the glazed [[Wardian case]] developed for British horticulturists in the 1830s to protect exotic plants on long sea voyages. (One feature of some [[19th-century]] aquaria that would prove curious to hobbyists today was the use of a metal base panel so that the aquarium water could be heated by flame.) [[Germany|German]]s rivaled the [[United Kingdom|British]] in their interest, and by the turn of the century [[Hamburg]] became the [[Europe]]an port of entry for many newly seen species. Aquaria became more widely popular as houses became almost universally electrified after [[World War I]]. With [[electricity]] great improvements were made in aquarium technology, allowing artificial lighting as well as the aeration, filtration, and heating of the water. Popularization was also assisted by the availability of air freight, which allowed a much wider variety of fish to be successfully imported from distant regions of origin that consequently attracted new hobbyists.

There are currently estimated to be about 60 million aquarium hobbyists worldwide, and many more aquaria kept by them. The hobby has the strongest following in Europe, [[Asia]], and [[North America]]. In the [[United States]], a large minority (40%) of aquarists maintain two or more tanks at any one time.

==Function and design==
From the outdoor ponds and glass jars of antiquity, modern aquaria have evolved into a wide range of specialized systems. Aquaria can vary in size from a small bowl large enough for a single small fish, to the huge public aquaria that can simulate entire marine [[ecosystem]]s. The most successful aquaria, as judged by the long-term survivability of its inhabitants, carefully emulate the natural environments that their residents would occupy in the wild.

Freshwater aquaria remain the most popular due to their lower cost and easier maintenance, but [[saltwater aquarium|marine (saltwater) aquaria]] have gained cachet as dedicated enthusiasts prove it is possible to preserve these challenging environments.

===Design===
[[Image:Aquarium.png|thumb|256px|Filtration system in a typical aquarium: (1) Intake. (2) Mechanical filtration. (3) Chemical filtration. (4) Biological filtration medium. (5) Outflow to tank.]]

The common freshwater aquarium maintained by a home aquarist typically includes a filtration system, an artificial lighting system, air pumps, and a heater. In addition, some freshwater tanks (and most saltwater tanks) use powerheads to increase water circulation.

Combined biological and mechanical filtration systems are now common; these are designed to remove potentially dangerous build up of nitrogenous wastes and [[phosphate]]s dissolved in the water, as well as particulate matter. Filtration systems are the most complexly engineered component of most home aquaria, and various designs are used. Most systems use pumps to remove a small portion of the tank's water to an external pathway where filtration occurs; the filtered water is then returned to the aquarium. [[Protein skimmer]]s, filtration devices that remove [[protein]]s and other waste from the water, are usually found only in salt water aquaria.

Air pumps are employed to adequately oxygenate (or in the case of a heavily planted aquarium, provide carbon dioxide to) the water. These devices, once universal, are now somewhat less commonly used as some newer filtration systems create enough surface agitation to supply adequate gas exchange at the surface. Aquarium heaters are designed to act as [[thermostat]]s to regulate water temperature at a level designated by the aquarist when the prevailing temperature of air surrounding the aquarium is below the desired water temperature. Coolers are also available for use in cold water aquaria or in parts of the world where the ambient room temperature is above the desired tank temperature.

An aquarium's physical characteristics form another aspect of aquarium design. Size, lighting conditions, density of floating and rooted plants, placement of bogwood, creation of caves or overhangs, type of [[substrate]], and other factors (including an aquarium's positioning within a room) can all affect the behavior and survivability of tank inhabitants.

The combined function of these elements is to maintain appropriate water quality and characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.

===Classifications===
Aquaria can be classified by several variables that determine the type of aquatic life that can be suitably housed. The conditions and characteristics of the water contained in an aquarium are the most important classification criteria, as most aquatic life will not survive even limited exposure to unsuitable water conditions. The size of an aquarium also limits the aquarist in what types of ecosystems he can reproduce, species selection, and biological loading.

====Water conditions====
[[Image:Aquarium-Monaco1.jpeg|thumb|A saltwater aquarium]]
The dissolved content of water is perhaps the most important aspect of water conditions, as dissolved [[salts]] and other constituents can dramatically impact basic water chemistry, and therefore how organisms are able to interact with their environment. Salt content, or [[salinity]], is the most basic classification of water conditions. An aquarium may have [[fresh water]] (a salt level of &lt; 0.5%), simulating a lake or river environment; [[sea water|salt water]] (a salt level of 5%–18%), simulating an ocean or sea environment; or [[brackish water]] (a salt level of 0.5%–5%), simulating environments lying between fresh and salt, such as [[estuary|estuaries]].

Several other water characteristics result from dissolved contents of the water, and are important to the proper simulation of natural environments. The [[pH]] of the water is a measure of [[alkaline|alkalinity]] or [[acidity]]. Hardness measures overall dissolved mineral content; [[soft water|soft]] or [[hard water|hard]] water may be preferred. [[Chemical oxygen demand|Dissolved organic content]] and dissolved gases content are also important factors.

Home aquarists typically use modified tap water supplied through their local [[municipal water system]] to fill their tanks. For freshwater aquaria, additives formulated to remove [[chlorine]] or [[chloramine]] (used to [[disinfectant|disinfect]] drinking water supplies for human consumption) are often all that is needed to make the water ready for aquarium use. Brackish or saltwater aquaria require the addition of a mixture of salts and other minerals, which are commercially available for this purpose. More sophisticated aquarists may make other modifications to their base water source to modify the water's alkalinity, hardness, or dissolved content of organics and gases, before adding it to their aquaria. In contrast, public aquaria with large water needs often locate themselves near a natural water source (such as a river, lake, or ocean) in order to have easy access to large volumes of water that does not require much further treatment.

====Secondary water characteristics====
Secondary water characteristics are also important to the success of an aquarium. The [[temperature]] of the water forms the basis of one of the two most basic aquarium classifications: tropical vs. cold water. Most fish and plant species tolerate only a limited range of water temperatures: Tropical or warm water aquaria, with an average temperature of about 25 &amp;deg;C (78 &amp;deg;F), are much more common and house most popular aquarium fish. Cold water aquaria are those with temperatures below what would be considered tropical; a variety of fish are better suited to this cooler environment.

Water movement can also be important in accurately simulating a natural ecosystem. Aquarists may prefer anything from still water up to swift simulated [[current (water)|currents]] in an aquarium, depending on the conditions best suited for the aquarium's inhabitants.

Water temperature can be regulated with a combined [[thermometer]]/heater unit (or, more rarely, with a cooling unit), while water movement can be controlled through the use of powerheads and careful design of internal water flow (such as location of filtration system points of inflow and outflow).

====Size====
[[Image:Aquariumsimple.jpg|thumb|400px|Simple hobbyist Aquarium, 80 x 30 x 40 cm, 96 liter]]

An aquarium can range from a small, unadorned glass bowl containing less than a liter of water – although generally unsuited for most fish (except, perhaps, air breathing fish such as [[Betta splendens]] or the [[Paradise Fish]]) – to massive tanks built in public aquaria which are limited only by engineering constraints and can house entire ecosystems as large as [[kelp forest]]s or species of large [[shark]]s. In general, larger aquarium systems are typically recommended to hobbyists due to their resistance to rapid fluctuations of temperature and [[pH]], allowing for greater system stability.

Aquaria kept in homes by hobbyists can be as small as 3 U.S. gallons (11 L). This size is widely considered the smallest practical system with filtration and other basic systems; indeed, the local government of [[Rome]] has recently taken the step of banning traditional goldfish bowls as inhumane. Practical limitations, most notably the [[weight]] (water weighs about 8.3 pounds per U.S. gallon (1 kg/L)) and internal [[water pressure]] (requiring thick, strong glass siding) of a large aquarium, keep most home aquaria to a maximum of around 1 m&amp;sup3; (300 U.S. gallons). However, some dedicated aquarists have been known to construct custom aquaria of up to several thousand U.S. gallons (several cubic meters), at great effort and expense.
	
Public aquaria designed for exhibition of large species or environments can be dramatically larger than any home aquarium. The [[Shedd Aquarium]] features an individual aquarium of two million U.S. gallons (7,500 m&amp;sup3;), as well as two others of 400,000 U.S. gallons (1,500 m&amp;sup3;). The [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] has an [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] viewing window into their largest tank. At 56 feet long by 17 feet high (17 by 5 m), it used to be the largest window in the world and is over 13 inches (330 mm) thick.  The Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium is the world's second largest aquarium and part of the Ocean Expo Park located in Motobu, Okinawa. Its main tank, which holds 7,500 cubic meters of water, features the world's largest acrylic panel measuring 8.2 meters by 22.5 meters with a thickness of 60 centimeters.  The size of public aquaria are usually limited by cost considerations.

===Species selection===
Several theories on species selection circulate within the community of hobby aquarists. Perhaps the most popular of these is the division of aquaria into either a ''community'' or ''aggressive'' tank type. Community tanks house several species that are not aggressive toward each other. This is the most common type of hobby aquarium kept today. Aggressive tanks, in contrast, house a limited number of species that can be aggressive toward other fish, or are able to withstand aggression well. In both of these tank types, the aquarium cohabitants may or may not originate from the same geographic region, but generally tolerate similar water conditions. In addition to the fish, [[invertebrate]]s, plants, and decorations or &quot;[[aquarium furniture]]&quot; (all of which may or may not be natural neighbors of any of the fish) are typically added to these tank types.

''Species'' or ''specimen'' tanks usually only house one fish species, along with plants, perhaps found in the fishes' natural environment and decorations simulating a true ecosystem. These tanks are often used for [[killifish]], livebearers, [[cichlids]] etc. They can be simple as bare bottom with a few necessities or a complex planted aquarium. Some tanks of this sort are used simply to house adults for breeding. Such tanks are common in fishrooms, where people keep many tanks at home. 

''Ecotype'' or ''ecotope'' aquaria attempt to simulate a specific ecosystem found in the natural world, bringing together fish, invertebrate species, and plants found in that ecosystem in a tank with water conditions and decorations designed to simulate their natural environment. These ecotype aquaria might be considered the most sophisticated hobby aquaria; indeed, reputable public aquaria all use this approach in their exhibits whenever possible. This approach best simulates the experience of observing an aquarium's inhabitants in the wild, and also usually serves as the healthiest possible artificial environment for the tank's occupants.

====Species selection for saltwater aquaria====
In addition to the types above, a special category of saltwater aquaria is the [[reef tank|reef aquarium]]. These aquaria attempt to simulate the complex reef ecosystems found in warm, tropical oceans around the world. These aquaria focus on the rich diversity of invertebrate life in these environments, and typically include only a limited number of small fish.  Techniques of maintaining [[sea anemones]], some [[corals]], [[live rock]], [[mollusk]]s, and [[crustacea]], developed since the 1980s, have made the recreations of a reef ecosystem possible.
Reef aquaria are widely considered the most difficult and demanding of the common hobbyist aquarium types, requiring the most expertise in addition to the most specialized equipment (and corresponding high cost).

===Source of aquarium inhabitants===
[[Image:AquariumDiverMed.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied diver]] interacts with viewers while feeding the fish]]

Fish and plants for the first modern aquaria were gathered from the wild and transported (usually by ship) to European and American ports. During the early [[twentieth century]] many species of small colorful [[tropical fish]] were caught and exported from [[Manaus]] [[Brazil]], [[Bangkok]] [[Thailand]], [[Siam]], [[Jakarta]] [[Indonesia]], the [[Dutch West Indies]], [[Calcutta]] [[India]], and other tropical ports. Collection of fish, plants, and invertebrates from the wild for supply to the aquarium trade continues today at locations around the world. In many places of the world, impoverished local villagers collect specimens for the aquarium trade as their prime means of income. It remains an important source for many species that have not been successfully bred in captivity, and continues to introduce new species to enthusiastic aquarists.

The practice of collection in the wild for eventual display in aquaria has several disadvantages. Collecting expeditions can be lengthy and costly, and are not always successful. The shipping process is very hazardous for the fish involved; [[mortality rate]]s are high. Many others are weakened by [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and become diseased upon arrival. Fish can also be injured during the collection process itself, most notably during the process of using [[cyanide]] to stun reef fish to make them easier to collect.

More recently, the potentially detrimental environmental impact of fish and plant collecting has come to the attention of aquarists worldwide. These include the poisoning of [[coral reef]]s and non-target species, the depletion of rare species from their natural habitat, and the degradation of ecosystems from large scale removal of key species. Additionally, the [[destructive fishing techniques]] used have become a growing concern to environmentalists and hobbyists alike.  Therefore, there has been a concerted movement by many concerned aquarists to reduce the trade's dependence on wild-collected specimens through captive breeding programs and certification programs for wild-caught fish. Among [[United States|American]] keepers of marine aquaria surveyed in 1997, two thirds said that they prefer to purchase farm raised coral instead of wild-collected coral, and over 80% think that only sustainably caught or captive bred fish should be allowed for trade.

Since the 'fighting fish' ''[[Betta splendens]]'' was first successfully bred in France in 1893, captive spawning techniques have been slowly discovered. Captive breeding for the aquarium trade is now concentrated in South [[Florida]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], and Bangkok, with smaller industries in [[Hawaii]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. Captive breeding programs of [[marine organisms]] for the aquarium trade have been urgently in development since the mid-1990s. Breeding programs for freshwater species are comparatively more advanced than for saltwater species.

[[Aquaculture]] is the cultivation of aquatic organisms in a controlled environment.  Supporters of aquaculture programs for supply to the aquarium trade claim that well-planned programs can bring benefits to the environment as well as the [[society]] around it. Aquaculture can help in lessening the impacts on wild stocks, either by using raised cultivated organisms directly for sale or by releasing them to replenish wild stock (Tlusty 203), although such a practice is associated with several environmental risks.

==Ecology==
Ideal aquarium [[ecology]] reproduces the [[equilibrium]] found in nature in the closed system of an aquarium. In practice it is virtually impossible to maintain a perfect balance. As an example, a balanced [[predation|predator-prey relationship]] is nearly impossible to maintain in even the largest of aquaria. Typically an aquarium keeper must take steps to maintain equilibrium in the small ecosystem contained in his aquarium.

Approximate equilibrium is facilitated by large volumes of water. Any event that perturbs the system pushes an aquarium away from equilibrium; the more water that is contained in a tank, the easier such a [[systemic shock]] is to absorb, as the effects of that event are diluted. For example, the death of the only fish in a three U.S. gallon tank (11 L) causes dramatic changes in the system, while the death of that same fish in a 100 U.S. gallon (400 L) tank with many other fish in it represents only a minor change in the balance of the tank. For this reason, hobbyists often favor larger tanks when possible, as they are more stable systems requiring less intensive attention to the maintenance of equilibrium.

===Nitrogen cycle===
[[Image:Aquarium Nitrogen Cycle.png|thumb|300px|The nitrogen cycle in an aquarium.]]

Of primary concern to the aquarist is management of the biological [[waste]] produced by an aquarium's inhabitants. Fish, invertebrates, [[fungus|fungi]], and some bacteria excrete [[nitrogen]] waste in the form of [[ammonia]] (which may convert to [[ammonium]], depending on water chemistry) which must then pass through the [[nitrogen cycle]]. Ammonia is also produced through the [[decomposition]] of plant and animal matter, including [[feces|fecal]] matter and other [[detritus]]. Nitrogen waste products become [[toxic]] to fish and other aquarium inhabitants at high concentrations.

A well-balanced tank contains organisms that are able to [[metabolism|metabolize]] the waste products of other aquarium residents. The nitrogen waste produced in a tank is metabolized in aquaria by a type of [[bacterium|bacteria]] known as [[nitrification|nitrifier]]s (genus Nitrosomonas). Nitrifying bacteria capture ammonia from the water and metabolize it to produce [[nitrite]]. Nitrite is also highly toxic to fish in high concentrations. Another type of bacteria, genus Nitrospira, converts nitrite into [[nitrate]], a less toxic substance to aquarium inhabitants. ([[Nitrobacter]] bacteria were previously believed to fill this role, and continue to be found in commercially available products sold as kits to &quot;jump start&quot; the nitrogen cycle in an aquarium. While biologically they could theoretically fill the same niche as Nitrospira, it has recently been found that Nitrobacter are not present in detectable levels in established aquaria, while Nitrospira are plentiful.) This process is known in the aquarium hobby as the nitrogen cycle.

In addition to bacteria, aquatic plants also eliminate nitrogen waste by metabolizing ammonia and nitrate. When plants metabolize nitrogen compounds, they remove nitrogen from the water by using it to build [[biomass]]. However, this is only temporary, as the plants release nitrogen back into the water when older leaves die off and decompose.

Although informally called the nitrogen cycle by hobbyists, it is in fact only a portion of a true cycle: nitrogen must be added to the system (usually through food provided to the tank inhabitants), and nitrates accumulate in the water at the end of the process (or contribute to a growth in biomass via plant metabolism). This accumulation of nitrates in home aquaria requires the aquarium keeper to remove water that is high in nitrates or remove plants which have grown from the nitrates. A balanced system, in which the fish eat the plants, is generally difficult to create.

Aquaria kept by hobbyists often do not have the requisite populations of bacteria needed to detoxify nitrogen waste from tank inhabitants. This problem is most often addressed through two [[filtration]] solutions: [[Activated carbon]] filters absorb nitrogen compounds and other [[toxins]] from the water, while biological filters provide a medium specially designed for [[colony (biology)|colonization]] by the desired nitrifying bacteria.

====Cycling====
New aquaria also do not usually have the required populations of bacteria for the handling of nitrogen waste. In a process called ''cycling'', aquarists cultivate these bacteria as fish and other producers of nitrogen waste are gradually added to the tank over the course of several weeks. Aquarists use several different methods to jump start this process, including the use of water additives containing small populations of the bacteria, or &quot;seeding&quot; a new tank with a mature bacterial colony removed from another aquarium (such as can be found on gravel or biological filter media).

Other cycling methods that have gained popularity in recent years are the ''fishless cycle'' and the ''silent cycle''. As the name of the former implies, no fish are kept in a tank undergoing a fishless cycle. Instead, small amounts of ammonia are added to the tank to feed the bacteria being cultured. During this process, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels are tested to monitor progress. The silent cycle is basically nothing more than densely stocking the aquarium with fast-growing aquatic plants and relying on them to consume the nitrogen products rather than bacteria. According to anecdotal reports of aquarists specializing in planted tanks, the plants can consume nitrogenous waste so efficiently that the spikes in ammonia and nitrite levels normally seen in more traditional cycling methods are greatly reduced, if they are detectable at all.

Improperly cycled aquaria can quickly accumulate toxic concentrations of nitrogen waste and kill its inhabitants.

===Other nutrient cycles===
Nitrogen is not the only nutrient that cycles through an aquarium. Dissolved oxygen enters the system at the surface water-air interface or through the actions of an air pump. Carbon dioxide escapes the system into the air. The phosphate cycle is an important, although often overlooked, nutrient cycle. Sulfur, iron, and micronutrients also cycle through the system, entering as food and exiting as waste. Appropriate handling of the nitrogen cycle, along with supplying an adequately balanced food supply and considered biological loading, is usually enough to keep these other nutrient cycles in approximate equilibrium.

===Biological loading===
Biological loading is a measure of the burden placed on the aquarium ecosystem by its living inhabitants. High biological loading in an aquarium represents a more complicated tank ecology, which in turn means that equilibrium is easier to perturb. In addition, there are several fundamental constraints on biological loading based on the size of an aquarium. The [[surface area]] of water exposed to air limits [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] intake by the tank. The capacity of nitrifying bacteria is limited by the physical space they have available to colonize. Physically, only a limited size and number of plants and animals can be fit into an aquarium while still providing room for movement.

In order to prevent biological overloading of the system, aquarists have developed a number of [[rule of thumb|rules of thumb]]. Perhaps the most popular of these is the &quot;one inch of fish per U.S. gallon&quot; rule, which dictates that the sum in inches of the lengths of all fish kept in an aquarium (excluding tail length) should not exceed the capacity of the tank measured in U.S. gallons (about 7 mm per liter of water).  This rule is usually applied to the expected mature size of the fish, in order to not stunt growth by overcrowding, which can be unhealthy for the fish.  For [[goldfish]] and other high-waste fish, some aquarists recommend doubling the space allowance to one inch of fish per every two gallons.

The true maximum or ideal biological loading of a system is very difficult to calculate, even on a theoretical level. To do so, the variables for waste production rate, nitrification [[efficiency]], gas exchange rate at the water surface, and many others would need to be determined. In practice this is a very complicated and difficult task, and so most aquarists use rules of thumb combined with a [[trial and error]] approach to reach an appropriate level of biological loading.

==Public aquaria==
[[Image:KelpAquariumMed.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A 335,000 U.S. gallon (1.3 million liter) aquarium at the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] in California displaying a simulated [[kelp forest]] ecosystem]]
Public aquaria are facilities open to the public for viewing of aquatic species in aquaria. Most public aquaria feature a number of smaller tanks, as well as one or more large tank greater in size than could be kept by any home aquarist. The largest tanks hold millions of U.S. gallons of water and can house large species, including [[dolphin]]s, [[shark]]s or [[beluga]] whales. Aquatic and semiaquatic animals, including [[otter]]s and [[penguin]]s, may also be kept by public aquaria.

Operationally, a public aquarium is similar in many ways to a [[zoo]] or [[museum]]. A good aquarium will have special exhibits to entice repeat visitors, in addition to its permanent collection. A few have their own version of a &quot;petting zoo&quot;; for instance, the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] has a shallow tank filled with common types of [[batoidea|rays]], and one can reach in to feel their leathery skins as they pass by.

Also as with zoos, aquaria usually have specialized research staff who study the habits and biology of their specimens. In recent years, the large aquaria have been attempting to acquire and raise various species of open-ocean fish, and even jellyfish (or sea-jellies, [[cnidaria]]), a difficult task since these creatures have never before encountered solid surfaces like the walls of a tank, and do not have the [[instinct]]s to turn aside from the walls instead of running into them.

The first public aquarium opened in [[London]]'s [[Regent's Park]] in 1853. [[P.T. Barnum]] quickly followed with the first American aquarium, opened on [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] in [[New York]]. Following early examples of Detroit, New York and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], many major cities now have public aquaria. Most public aquaria are located close to the [[ocean]], for a steady supply of natural seawater. An inland pioneer was [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]'s [[Shedd Aquarium]] that received seawater shipped by rail in special tank cars.  In contrast, the recently opened [[Georgia Aquarium]] filled its tanks with fresh water from the city water system and salinated its salt water exhibits using the same commercial salt and mineral additives available to home aquarists. 

In January 1985 Kelly Tarlton began construction of the first aquarium to include a large transparent [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] tunnel in [[Auckland, New Zealand]], a task that took 10 months and cost NZ$3 million. The 110-meter tunnel was built from one-tonne slabs of German sheet plastic that were shaped locally in an oven. A moving walkway now transports visitors through, and groups of school children occasionally hold sleepovers there beneath the swimming sharks and rays.

Top public aquaria are often affiliated with important oceanographic research institutions or conduct their own research programs, and usually (though not always) specialize in species and ecosystems that can be found in local waters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a [[partial order|poset]] ''P'' is said to satisfy the '''ascending chain condition''' (ACC)
if every ascending chain ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;... of elements of ''P'' is eventually stationary,
that is, there is some positive [[integer]] ''n'' such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''.
Similarly, ''P'' is said to satisfy the '''descending chain condition''' (DCC)
if every descending chain ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;... of elements of ''P'' is eventually stationary (that is, there is no [[infinite descending chain]]).

The ascending chain condition on ''P'' is equivalent to the '''maximum condition''': every nonempty subset of ''P'' has a maximal element.
Similarly, the descending chain condition is equivalent to the '''minimum condition''': every nonempty subset of ''P'' has a minimal element.

Every finite poset satisfies both ACC and DCC.

A [[total order|totally ordered set]] that satisfies the descending chain condition is called a [[well-order|well-ordered set]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Rabbi_Steinsaltz_photo.jpg|right|framed|Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz]]

[[Rabbi]] '''Adin Steinsaltz''' or '''Even Yisrael''' (born 1937) is a teacher, philosopher, social critic and prolific author who has been hailed by [[Time magazine]] as a &quot;once-in-a-millennium scholar.&quot; His lifelong work in Jewish education earned him the [[Israel Prize]], his country’s highest honor. He is affiliated with the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] sect. He is the [[Nasi]] and most prominent public member of an attempt to revive the [[Sanhedrin#A &quot;New&quot; Sanhedrin?|Sanhedrin]].

Born in [[Jerusalem]] in 1937 to secular parents, Rabbi Steinsaltz studied [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] at the [[Hebrew University]]. Following graduation, he established several experimental schools and, at the age of 24, became [[Israel]]’s youngest school principal.

In 1965, he founded the Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications and began his monumental [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] translation and commentary on the [[Talmud]]. To date, he has published 38 of the anticipated 46 volumes. While not without criticism (e.g. by [[Jacob Neusner|Neusner]], 1998), the Steinsaltz edition is widely used throughout Israel, the United States and the world. Over 2 million volumes of the Steinsaltz Talmud have been distributed to date. 

The translation of the Talmud from Aramaic to Hebrew increased the amount of people who are able to study its content. His translation opened the door for women who traditionally are not taught Talmud, and are therefore not proficient in Aramaic, to study the Talmud. Modern Orthodox High Schools and Seminaries teach women Talmud using his translation. The amount of men who are capable of studying Talmud increased as a result of Steinzalts' work. 

Regarding the access that his work provides, Steinsaltz says “I never thought that spreading ignorance has any advantage, except for those who are in a position of power and want to deprive others of their rights and spread ignorance in order to keep them underlings. My gemmarot are surely used, if they are used anywhere, in Matan [a yeshiva for Orthodox women in Jerusalem], from beginning to end. Why? Because they help skip the elementary school level of training. That makes learning Talmud for them possible, and if it is possible then it is challenging and some of the men don’t want that challenge.” 

The Rabbi’s classic work of [[Kabbalah]], ''The Thirteen Petalled Rose'', was first published in 1980 and now appears in eight languages. In all, Rabbi Steinsaltz has authored some 60 books and hundreds of articles on subjects including [[Talmud]], Jewish mysticism, religious thought, [[sociology]], historical biography, and [[philosophy]].  

Continuing his work as a teacher and spiritual mentor, Rabbi Steinsaltz established a network of schools and educational institutions in Israel and the former Soviet Union. He has served as scholar in residence at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and the Institute for Advanced Studies at [[Princeton University]]. His honorary degrees include doctorates from [[Yeshiva University]], [[Ben Gurion University of the Negev]], [[Bar Ilan University]], [[Brandeis University]], and [[Florida International University]]. Rabbi Steinsaltz is also [[Rosh Yeshiva]] of [[Yeshivat Hesder]] [[Tekoa]], and, [http://www.israelnn.com/news.php3?id=83438 controversially], functions as [[Nasi]] in the [[Sanhedrin#A_.22New.22_Sanhedrin.3F|&quot;new Sanhedrin&quot;]].

 

Rabbi Steinsaltz and his wife have three children and ten grandchildren.  He lives in Jerusalem.

'''Aberrant''' is a [[superhero]]-based [[role-playing game]] created by [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf Game Studio]] in [[1999]], set in 2008AD in a world where super-powered humans started appearing one day in 1998 out of the blue.  The game deals with how the players' meta-human characters (called ''novas'') fit into a mundane world when they most definitely are ''not'' mundane, as well as how the mundane populace react to the sudden emergence of novas.  The original Aberrant product line was discontinued in [[2002]], though a [[d20 System]] version was released in 2004.

==Setting==
Super powers in Aberrant come from an individual's ability to manipulate energy at the &quot;quantum&quot; sub-atomic level.  Since individuals who can do this have an imperfect understanding of [[quantum mechanics]], their powers always follow a specific path or are linked to a specific focus.  For instance, all the powers of the nova called Anteus revolve around nature; he can teleport by stepping into a tree and out of another tree of the same type somewhere else, create new species of animals, or alter the normal course of life and death for plants and animals.  All his powers follow his focus of nature.  Other novas have other foci such as plasma, fire, water, shapechanging, or invulnerability.

As a nova's ability to manipulate the quantum fabric of the world grows, he begins to experience Taint, the side effects of channelling larger and larger amounts of energy.  Taint is the 'non-humanness' side of quantum manipulation and at higher levels novas begin to show either physical or mental defects.  These defects vary widely; a tentacle growing from one's stomach, sociopathic disorders, hair made of flames, odd skin composition (such as rubber), a power that is &quot;always on&quot;, megalomania, or continual radiation.

Aberrant is unique among the publisher's game-lines for having no particular [[caste]]s or ''character classes''.  Aside from this, it shares with many other White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf games a tendency to embrace &quot;shades of gray&quot; morality and reject the traditional superhero trope of &quot;heroes vs. villains&quot;.

Aberrant is the prequel to [[Trinity (Aeon)|Trinity]] and the successor to 
[[Adventure! (role-playing game)|Adventure!]].  Trinity details the future history of the novas, over a 60-year span of time.

==Factions==
The metaplot revolves around the interactions between various factions, most of which employ Nova agents. Among the most important are:

*Project Utopia, an organisation with altruistic ideals that promotes cooperation between Novas and humans to build a more perfect world. Utopia has [[United Nations|UN]] sanction to deal with novas. It is also linked to the Aeon Trinity organisation, which rises to greater prominence in ''Trinity'' and whose roots are detailed in ''Adventure!''
*The Teragen, a diverse group of Novas who claim biological superiority to humans.
*The Aberrants, a group of Novas concerned about evidence of corruption within Project Utopia. While a small faction, they are nevertheless taken very seriously by Project Utopia.
*The Directive, an intelligence organisation controlled by the governments of [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Japan]] and the [[United States of America|United States]].

Various smaller groups exist, most of which are focused on more specific goals. Players' characters generally belong to one of the above factions, work for a specific corporation, or hire themselves out for odd jobs, often as mercenaries or troubleshooters.

==System==
Aberrant uses a modified version of the [[Storyteller System]].  A character adds his attribute to his skill (or power as the case may be) and rolls that many 10 sided dice.  Any dice that comes up as a 7 or higher counts as 1 success.  Accomplishing different tasks require different numbers of successes to accomplish.  Flying a plane may only require 1 success, but flying a 747 with a near fatal wound, all the rest of the crew dead, and no hydraulic pressure could require 5 or more successes.  

The first major difference with Aberrant is that in addition to normal attributes such as Dexterity, Manipulation and Wits, novas have what are called ''Mega attributes''.  Scores in such attributes are added as dice every time a character makes a roll using the linked mundane attribute, but Mega-Attributes are much more powerful.  Every success rolled using mega attribute dice count as 2 normal successes, and rolling a 10 counts as 3 successes.

Powers are treated almost exactly like skills except that they come in different levels of power.  Level 1 powers are comparatively weak, while level 6 powers can do nearly anything (a famous level 6 power is 'Universe Creation').  Lower level powers are cheaper to purchase with experience, while higher level powers cost more.  There are a wide range of powers from controlling any single element (fire, gravity, entropy, quantum, magnetism, etc...), to flying, to mental domination, to imperviousness, to time travel and teleportation.

[[Image:Rutskoi.jpg|frame|Aleksandr Rutskoy in his Kursk office in [[2003]]]]
'''Aleksandr Vladimirovich Rutskoy''' (Russian: ''Александр Владимирович Руцкой'') ([[September 16]], [[1945]]-) is a [[Russia|Russian]] politician and a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military officer. Rutskoy was Vice-President of Russian Federation (1991-1993), and on September 22, 1993 he took an oath of the President. He was born in [[Kursk]], [[Russia]].


== Biography ==

Rutskoy was a Soviet air force colonel during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]], where he was injured. He was shot down by a F-16 of the [[Pakistan Air Force]] on August 4, 1988 by Sqn. Ldr. Bukhari while he was flying a Su-25 aircraft at night when he had entered Pakistan's aerospace. [http://www.geocities.com/Baja/Dunes/1107/heroes.htm]. As a soldier and a populist, he was chosen by [[Boris Yeltsin]] to be his vice presidential running mate in the 1991 Russian presidential election.

Rutskoy was the [[Vice President of Russia]] from [[July 10]], [[1991]] to [[September 1]], [[1993]], when he was sacked by president [[Boris Yeltsin]] on corruption charges.  The real issue, however, was that Rutskoy sided with the parliament during the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]], which was triggered when Yeltsin tried to dissolve the parliament on [[September 21]], the parliament responded by declaring Yeltsin's presidency unconstitutional and appointing Rutskoy acting president.

On September 21, 1993, after the decree of president [[Boris Yeltsin]] that illegally dissolved  the [[Supreme Soviet]], Rutskoy assumed the position of president in accordance with Article 121-6 of the Constitution:

:'''Article 121-6.''' ''Authority of the President of Russian Federation cannot be used to change national and state organization of Russian Federation, dissolution or halting activity of any elected organs of state power.''

On that day, Rutskoy said: &quot;I am taking the authority of President. Anticonstitutional decree of President Yeltsin is annulated.&quot; On September 22, during the night time, he took the presidential oath. On October 4, the Parliament building was taken by Yeltsin's military forces.  Rutskoy and his supporters were arrested. They were charged with organization of mass disturbances. On February 26, 1994 Rutskoy was released from prison by the Decision of State Duma. Rutskoy's interim presidency, although constitutional, was never acknowledged outside Russia. 

Shortly after his release, Rutskoy founded a one-man political party, [[Derzhava]] ('The Great Power' in Russian, see [http://www.nupi.no/cgi-win/Russland/polgrupp.exe?Derzhava]), nationalist/communist in its ideology, and contested for presidency in 1996 as well as in the [[State Duma]] election of [[1995]], but didn't manage to pass the 5% threshold. He was elected, however, governor of [[Kursk Oblast]] in [[1996]]. 

Rutskoy was a central figure in the aggravation of the [[Transnistria]] military conflict. His [[1992]] visit in [[Tiraspol]] delivered the clear message of the Russian sustain, including military support, for the Russian population of the Moldavian breakaway entity. 

He was banned from running in [[2000]] [[Kursk]]'s governor elections on a technicality for failing to register his car.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alfred Edward Housman''' ([[March 26]], [[1859]] – [[April 30]], [[1936]]), usually known as A.E. Housman, was an [[England|English]] [[poet]] and [[classics|classical scholar]], now best known for his cycle of poems ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]''.

== Life ==

Housman was born in [[Fockbury]], [[Worcestershire]], the eldest of seven children of a country solicitor. His brother [[Laurence Housman]] and sister [[Clemence Housman]] also became writers.

Housman was educated first in [[King Edward's School]], then in [[Bromsgrove School]] where he acquired a strong academic grounding and won prizes for his poetry. In 1877 he won an open scholarship to [[St John's College, Oxford]], where he studied classics. He was a brilliant student, gaining first class honours in classical moderations, but a withdrawn person whose only friends were his roommates Moses Jackson and [[A. W. Pollard]]. Housman fell in love with the handsome, athletic Jackson who, being heterosexual, rejected him, though the two remained friends. This experience, reflected in some of his poems, may be an explanation of Housman's unexpected failure in his final exams (the &quot;Greats&quot;) in 1881. Housman took this failure very seriously but managed to take a pass degree the next year, after a brief period of teaching in [[Bromsgrove School]].

After graduating, Jackson got a job as a [[Patent clerk|clerk]] in the [[Patent Office]] in [[London]] and arranged a job there for Housman as well. They shared an apartment with Jackson's brother Adalbert until 1885 when Housman moved in to lodgings of his own. Moses Jackson married and moved to [[Ceylon]] in 1887 and Adalbert Jackson died in 1892. Housman continued pursuing classical studies independently and published scholarly articles on such authors as [[Horace]], [[Propertius]], [[Ovid]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]] and [[Sophocles]]. He gradually acquired such a high reputation that in 1892 he was offered the professorship of Latin at [[University College London]], which he accepted.

Although Housman's sphere of responsibilities as professor included both [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], he put most of his energy in the study of Latin classics. His reputation in this field grew steadily, and in 1911 he took the [[Kennedy Professorship of Latin]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he remained for the rest of his life. It was unusual at the time for an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] man such as Housman to be hired at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. During 1903–1930, he published his critical edition of [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]]'s ''Astronomicon'' in five volumes. He also edited works of [[Juvenal]] (1905) and [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]] (1926). Many colleagues were afraid of his scathing critical attacks on those whom he found guilty of unscholarly sloppiness. To his students he appeared as a severe, reticent, remote authority. The only pleasures he allowed himself in his spare time were those of [[gastronomy]] which he also practised on frequent visits to France and Italy.

Housman always found his true vocation in classical studies and treated poetry as a secondary activity. He never spoke about his poetry in public until 1933 when he gave a lecture, &quot;The Name and Nature of Poetry&quot;, in which he argued that poetry should appeal to emotions rather than intellect. He died two years later in Cambridge. His ashes are buried near St Laurence's Church, [[Ludlow]], Shropshire.

== Poetry ==

During his years in London, A E Housman completed his cycle of 63 poems, ''[[A Shropshire Lad]].''
After several publishers had turned it down, he published it at his own expense in 1896, much to the surprise of his colleagues and students.
At first the book sold slowly, but Housman's nostalgic depiction of brave English soldiers struck a chord with English readers and his poems became a lasting success.
Later, [[World War I]] had a further increasing effect on their popularity.
Several composers, [[Arthur Somervell]] first, found inspiration in the seeming folksong-like simplicity of the poems.
The most famous musical settings are by [[George Butterworth]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], with others by [[Ivor Gurney]], [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] and [[Ernest John Moeran]].

Housman was surprised by the success of ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]'' because it, like all his poetry, is imbued with a deep pessimism and an obsession with all-pervasive death, with no place for the consolations of religion.
Set in a half-imaginative pastoral [[Shropshire]], &quot;the land of lost content&quot; (in fact Housman wrote most of the poems before ever visiting the place), the poems explore themes of fleetingness of love and decay of youth in a spare, uncomplicated style which many critics of the time found out of date compared with the exuberance of some Romantic poets.
Housman himself acknowledged the influence of the songs of [[William Shakespeare]], the Scottish Border Ballads and [[Heinrich Heine]], but specifically denied any influence of Greek and Latin classics in his poetry.

In the early 1920s, when Moses Jackson was dying in Canada, Housman wanted to assemble his best unpublished poems together so that Jackson could read them before his death.
These later poems, most of them written before 1910, show a greater variety of subject and form than those in ''A Shropshire Lad'' but also a certain lack of the kind of consistency found in the earlier poems.
He published them as his [[Last Poems]] (1922) because he thought that his poetic inspiration was running out and that he would not publish any more poems in his lifetime.
This proved true.

Housman's brother Laurence edited his posthumous poems which appeared in ''More Poems'' (1936) and ''Complete Poems'' (1939).
In these poems, Housman appears more candid about his [[homosexuality]] and [[atheism]] than in his lifetime, though the essay ''De Amicitia'', published by Laurence Housman in 1967, is even more revealing.
Housman also wrote a parodic ''Fragment of a Greek Tragedy'', in English, and humorous poems published posthumously under the title ''Unkind to Unicorns''.

Housman's most familiar poem is surely &quot;When I was one-and-twenty,&quot; number XIII from ''A Shropshire Lad.''
The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations includes no fewer than fourteen of its sixteen lines:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When I was one-and-twenty&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I heard a wise man say,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Give crowns and pounds and guineas&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But not your heart away;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Give pearls away and rubies&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But keep your fancy free.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But I was one-and-twenty,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;No use to talk to me.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When I was one-and-twenty&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I heard him say again,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;The heart out of the bosom&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Was never given in vain;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'Tis paid with sighs a plenty&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And sold for endless rue.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And I am two-and-twenty&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And oh, 'tis true, 'tis true.

This poem is, in fact, a good example of the style and melancholy tone of the whole collection.
Many of its poems dwell on mortality: &quot;With rue my heart is laden/For golden friends I had,/For many a rose-lipt maiden/And many a lightfoot lad.&quot; 

Poem XVII, &quot;Is my team ploughing?,&quot; is a dialogue between a dead youth and a friend who has survived him.
The dead youth asks &quot;Is my girl happy/That I thought hard to leave/And is she tired of weeping/As she lies down to eve?&quot; The living replies &quot;Ay, she lies down lightly/She lies not down to weep/Your girl is well contented/Be still, my lad, and sleep.&quot;
As the reader has begun to suspect, two stanzas later the living man acknowledges &quot;I cheer a dead man's sweetheart/Never ask me whose.&quot;

Poem LXII, &quot;Terence, this is stupid stuff,&quot; is a dialogue in which the poet, asked for &quot;a tune to dance to&quot; instead of his usual &quot;moping melancholy&quot; verse, offers (perhaps [[irony|ironically]]) the respite of drunkenness as a way to inure oneself to the pain of existence -- &quot;Malt does more than Milton can/To justify God's ways to man&quot; -- and pessimism as a longer-lasting immunization:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Therefore, since the world has still&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Much good, but much less good than ill,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And while the sun and moon endure&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Luck's a chance, but trouble's sure,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'd face it as a wise man would,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And train for ill and not for good.

The uniform style and tone of ''A Shropshire Lad'' make it an easy target for parody, as in this example by [[Humbert Wolfe]]:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When lads have done with labor&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in Shropshire, one will cry&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Let's go and kill a neighbor,&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and t'other answers &quot;Aye!&quot;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So this one kills his cousins,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and that one kills his dad;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and, as they hang by dozens&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;at Ludlow, lad by lad,

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;each of them one-and-twenty,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;all of them murderers,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the hangman mutters: &quot;Plenty&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;even for Housman's verse.&quot;


Another great poem by Housman, contrasting death with fleeting beauty and physical prowess, is the following:

To an Athlete Dying Young&lt;br /&gt;
By Alfred Edward Housman

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The time you won your town the race&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We chaired you through the market-place;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Man and boy stood cheering by,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And home we brought you shoulder-high.&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Today, the road all runners come,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Shoulder-high we bring you home,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And set you at your threshold down,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Townsman of a stiller town.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Smart lad, to slip betimes away&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;From fields where glory does not stay&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And early though the laurel grows&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It withers quicker than the rose.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Eyes the shady night has shut&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cannot see the record cut,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And silence sounds no worse than cheers&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After earth has stopped the ears:&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now you will not swell the rout&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of lads that wore their honors out,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Runners whom renown outran&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And the name died before the man.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So set, before its echoes fade,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The fleet foot on the sill of shade,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And hold to the low lintel up&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The still-defended challenge-cup.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And round the early-laureled head&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And find unwithered on its curls&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The garland briefer than a girl’s

      <text xml:space="preserve">General '''Augusto José Ramón Pinochet Ugarte'''{{an|Name}} (born [[November 25]], [[1915]]) was head of the [[military dictatorship]] that ruled [[Chile]] from [[1973]] to [[1990]]. He came to power in a violent [[coup d'état|coup]] that deposed [[Salvador Allende]], a [[Marxism|Marxist]] physician who had become the first [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist]] to be elected [[President of Chile]]. The coup ended a period of strained relations between the [[United States]]—which had actively sought Allende's removal—and the [[South America]]n country, and allowed Pinochet to implement profound [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic reforms and, at the same time, to commit extensive [[human rights violation]]s, both at home and abroad.

On [[September 11]], [[1973]], the military, led by Pinochet, stormed the presidential palace and seized power from President Allende, who was found dead soon after. A [[junta]] headed by Pinochet was established, which immediately suspended the constitution, dissolved [[Congress of Chile|Congress]], imposed strict censorship, proscribed the [[left-wing politics|leftist]] parties that had constituted Allende's [[Popular Unity]] coalition, and halted all political activity. In addition, it embarked on a campaign of terror against opponents and perceived [[leftist]]s in the country. As a result, approximately 3,000 Chilean [[resident]]s are known to have been executed, or &quot;[[forced disappearance|disappeared]]&quot;, more than 27,000{{an|Tortured}} were [[incarcerated]] and in a great many cases [[torture]]d, according to the [[Valech Report]]. Many were [[exile]]d and received abroad, in particular in [[Argentina]], as political refugees; but they were followed in their exile by the [[DINA]] secret police, in the frame of [[Operation Condor]] which linked South-American dictatorships together against political opponents.

In 1980, a new constitution was approved, which prescribed a single-candidate presidential [[plebiscite]] in 1988, and a return to civilian rule in 1990. Pinochet lost the 1988 plebiscite, which triggered multi-candidate presidential elections in 1989 to choose his replacement. Pinochet transferred power to [[Patricio Aylwin]], the new democratically elected president, in 1990; however, he retained his post as [[commander-in-chief]] of the army until 1998, when he assumed a seat in the [[Senate of Chile|Chilean Senate]], which was intended to be his for the duration of his life, according to the constitutional amendments of 1980. In 1998 Pinochet, who still had much influence in Chile, travelled to [[Britain]] for medical treatment. While there, he was arrested on a warrant from Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] and kept under house arrest for over a year, before eventually being released on medical grounds. He returned to Chile and resigned his senatorial seat in 2002, after a Supreme Court ruling that he suffered from &quot;vascular dementia&quot; and therefore could not stand trial for [[human rights]] abuses&amp;mdash;allegations of abuses had been made numerous times before his arrest, but never acted upon. In [[May 2004]], Chile's supreme court ruled that he was capable of standing trial, and he was charged with several crimes in December of that year.

Supporters of Pinochet credit him with staving off the beginning of [[Communism]], fighting terrorism from radical groups such as [[Movement of the Revolutionary Left|MIR]], and implementing [[free market]] policies that laid the groundwork for rapid economic growth that continued into the [[1990s]]. His opponents charge him with destroying Chile's democracy, pursuing a policy of [[state terrorism]], catering exclusively for private interests, and adopting economic policies that favored the wealthy and hurt the country's middle- and low-income sectors. While it was originally denied by his supporters, it is now generally accepted that Pinochet's government was responsible for torturing and killing thousands of people perceived to be opponents.

==Early career==
Pinochet was born in [[Valparaíso]] on [[November 25]], [[1915]], the son of Augusto Pinochet Vera and Avelina Ugarte Martínez. He went to primary and secondary school at the San Rafael Seminary of Valparaíso, the Quillota Institute ([[Marist Brothers]]), the French Fathers' School of Valparaíso, and in the Military School, which he entered in 1933. After four years of study, in 1937 he graduated with the rank of ''alférez'' ([[Second Lieutenant]]) in the [[infantry]].

In [[September]] [[1937]], he was assigned to the &quot;Chacabuco&quot; Regiment, in [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. Two years later, in 1939, then with the rank of sub-lieutenant, he moved to the &quot;Maipo&quot; Regiment, garrisoned in Valparaíso. He returned to Infantry School in 1940. On [[January 30]], [[1943]], he married [[Lucía Hiriart|Lucía Hiriart Rodríguez]], with whom he had five children: three daughters (Inés Lucía, María Verónica, Jacqueline Marie) and two sons (Augusto Osvaldo and Marco Antonio).

At the end of 1945, he was assigned to the &quot;Carampangue&quot; Regiment in the northern city of [[Iquique]]. In 1948, he entered the War Academy, but he had to postpone his studies, because, being the youngest officer, he had to carry out a service mission in the [[coal]] zone of [[Lota, Chile|Lota]]. The following year, he returned to his studies in the Academy.

After obtaining the title of Officer Chief of Staff, in 1951, he returned to teach at the Military School. At the same time, he worked as a teachers' aide at the War Academy, giving military geography and geopolitics classes. In addition to this, he was active as editor of the institutional magazine ''Cien Águilas'' (&quot;One Hundred Eagles&quot;).

At the beginning of 1953, with the rank of major, he was sent for two years to the &quot;Rancagua&quot; Regiment in [[Arica, Chile|Arica]]. While there, he was appointed professor of the War Academy, and he returned to [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] to take up his new position. He also obtained a [[baccalaureate]], and with this degree, he entered the University of Chile's Law School.

[[Image:Allende-Pinochet.jpg|thumb|right|Pinochet (left) and Allende in 1973]]

In 1956, Pinochet was chosen, together with a group of other young officers, to form a military mission that would collaborate in the organization of the War Academy of [[Ecuador]] in [[Quito]], which forced him to suspend his law studies. He remained with the Quito mission for three-and-a-half years, during which time he dedicated himself to the study of [[geopolitics]], [[military geography]] and intelligence.

At the end of 1959, he returned to Chile and was sent to General Headquarters of the I Army Division, based in [[Antofagasta, Chile|Antofagasta]]. The following year, he was appointed Commander of the &quot;Esmeralda&quot; Regiment. Due to his success in this position, he was appointed Sub-director of the War Academy in 1963.

In 1968, he was named Chief of Staff of the II Army Division, based in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], and at the end of that year, he was promoted to Brigadier General and Commander in Chief of the VI Division, garrisoned in [[Iquique]]. In his new function, he was also appointed Intendant of the [[Tarapacá]] Province.

In January 1971, he rose to Division General, and was named General Commander of the Santiago Army Garrison. At the beginning of 1972, he was appointed General Chief of Staff of the Army. With rising domestic strife in Chile, Pinochet was appointed Army Commander in Chief on [[August 23]], [[1973]] by President [[Salvador Allende]].

==Military coup of 1973==
''Main article: [[Chilean coup of 1973]].''
[[Image:Pinochetjunta.jpg|thumb|Pinochet (sitting) as head of the newly established military junta.]]

General Pinochet came to power in a [[coup d'état]] on [[September 11]], [[1973]], in which the rebelling Chilean Air Force bombed the [[Palacio de La Moneda|Presidential Palace]] while it was being stormed by Army troops. President [[Salvador Allende|Allende]] died during the capture of the palace. The exact circumstances of his death are disputed. According to the junta's official version, he committed suicide with a machine gun [http://www.presidencia.gob.cl/view/viewGaleriaPresidentes.asp?id=31&amp;seccion=Presidencia%20por%20Dentro&amp;interfazseccion=Galeria%20Presidentes#a31] which bore a golden plate engraved ''&quot;To my good friend Salvador Allende from [[Fidel Castro]].&quot;''  At the time and for many years after, his supporters nearly uniformly presumed that he was killed by the forces staging the coup. Another version says that Allende was killed in combat on the steps outside the Presidential Palace. An autopsy in 1990 found that Allende's wounds were consistent with the suicide account.

The new junta was made up of Pinochet representing the Army, Admiral [[José Toribio Merino]] representing the Navy, General [[Gustavo Leigh]] representing the Air Force, and [[César Mendoza]] representing the ''[[carabineros]]'' (the uniformed police). Since Pinochet was the chief of the oldest branch of the military forces (the Army), he was made the head of the victorious [[military dictatorship|junta]] — this position was originally to be rotated among the four branches, but was later made permanent. The [[military dictatorship|junta]] immediately moved to crush their left-wing opposition, arresting hundreds of people and killing many of them. Thousands more were arrested and tortured over the next three years, and a total of more than 3,000 were killed. Internationally, the Pinochet government became known for severe [[human rights abuse]]s, including 
many &quot;[[disappear]]ances&quot;.

In his [[memoir]]s, Pinochet affirms that he was the leading plotter of the coup, and used his position as Commander of the Army to coordinate a far-reaching scheme with the other two branches of the military and the national police. In recent years, however, high military officials from the time have said that Pinochet reluctantly got involved in the coup only a few days before it was scheduled to occur and followed the lead of other branches (especially the Navy) as they triggered the coup.

Once the Junta was in power, Pinochet soon consolidated his control, first retaining sole chairmanship of the [[military dictatorship|junta]], and then being proclaimed President on [[June 27]], [[1974]]. He was also promoted to the supreme army rank of ''Capitán General'' (literally Captain General), previously borne by colonial governors and by [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], a hero of Chile's war of independence, and first head of state.

General Leigh of the Air Force became increasingly opposed to Pinochet's policies, and he was kicked out of the junta on [[July 24]], [[1978]]. He was replaced by General [[Fernando Matthei]].

During 1977 and 1978, Chile was on the brink of war with Argentina (also ruled by a military government) over a disagreement regarding the ownership of the strategic [[Picton, Lennox and Nueva]] islands at the southern tip of South America. [[Antonio Samoré]], a representative of [[Pope John Paul II]], successfully prevented full-scale war. The conflict was finally resolved on 1984, with the Treaty of Peace and Friendship (''Tratado de Paz y Amistad''). Chilean sovereignty over the islands is now undisputed.

==Pinochet's economic policy==
[[Image:Augusto Pinochet with presidential band.jpg|thumb|Pinochet as self-proclaimed President]]

Once in power, Pinochet immediately set about making market-oriented economic reforms. He declared that he wanted &quot;to make Chile not a nation of proletarians, but a nation of proprietors&quot;. This was a play on words using the Spanish, &quot;propietarios&quot;, i.e. owners or business proprietors which rhymes with &quot;proletarios&quot;, i.e. proletarians. To formulate his economic policy, Pinochet relied on the so-called [[Chicago Boys]], who were economists trained at the [[University of Chicago]] and heavily influenced by the monetarist policies of [[Milton Friedman]].

Pinochet launched an era of economic [[deregulation]] and [[privatization]]. To accomplish his objectives, he abolished the [[minimum wage]], rescinded [[trade union]] rights, privatized the [[pension]] system, state [[industry|industries]], and [[bank]]s, and lowered [[tax]]es on [[wealth]] and [[profit]]s. Supporters of these policies (most notably Milton Friedman himself) have dubbed them &quot;[[Miracle of Chile|The Miracle of Chile]]&quot;, due to the 35% increase in real per capita GDP from 1960 to 1980 (later, from 1980 to 2000, it increased by 94%, but Pinochet was no longer in power after 1990).  There is much disagreement amongst economists regarding the accuracy of such statistics, with both sides normally selectively choosing those that better reflect their argument.  However, Pinochet did manage to address part of these problems during his final years as President, since unemployment was down to 7.8% in 1990. The shortage problems during the final years of Allende's administration were also remedied.

President Allende's economic policy had involved nationalizations of many key companies, notably U.S.-owned copper mines. This had been a significant reason behind the external Western opposition to Allende's Marxist government, in addition to his friendliness with [[Cuba]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Much of the internal opposition to Allende's policies was from business sectors, and recently-released U.S. government documents confirm that the U.S. funded the lorry drivers' strike, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,260382,00.html] that had exacerbated the already chaotic economic situation prior to the coup.

==Suppression of opposition==
[[Image:Chilean 1973 Junta.jpg|thumb|220px|Chile's military junta of 1973]]

After the military's seizure of power, Pinochet engaged in brutal political repression, aiming to destroy all remaining support for the defeated [[Unidad Popular|Popular Unity]] (PU) government. In [[October 1973]], at least 70 people were killed by the [[Caravan of Death]]. Almost immediately, the junta banned all the leftist parties that had constituted Allende's UP coalition. Much of the regime's violence was directed toward those it viewed as socialist or Marxist sympathizers, though dissidents who spoke out against the government were also persecuted. Those murdered during Pinochet's 17 years in power are said to have &quot;[[Forced disappearance|been disappeared]].&quot; It is not known exactly how many people were killed by government and military forces during the 17 years that he was in power, but the [[Rettig Report|Rettig Commission]] listed 2,095 deaths on both sides and 1,102 &quot;disappearances.&quot; [[Torture]] was also commonly used against dissidents. Thousands of Chileans fled the country to escape the regime. In 2004, the National Commission on Political Prisoners and Torture produced the [[Valech Report]] after interviewing an estimated 35,000 people who claimed to have been abused by the regime. About 28,000 of those testimonies were regarded as legitimate. According to the Commission, more than half of the arrests occurred in the months immediately following the coup (approximately 18,000 of those testifying claimed they were detained between September and December of 1973).

Pinochet's presidency was frequently made unstable by riots and isolated violent attacks. Assassination attempts were common, which increased government paranoia and contributed to the cycle of oppression.

In contrast to most other nations in [[Latin America]], prior to the coup Chile had a long tradition of democratic civilian rule; military intervention in politics had been rare. Some political scientists have ascribed the bloodiness of the coup to the stability of the existing democratic system, which required extreme action to overturn.

The situation in Chile came to international attention in September 1976, when [[Orlando Letelier]], a former Chilean [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassador]] to the [[United States]] and minister in Allende's cabinet, was killed by a car bomb in [[Washington, D.C.]]. General [[Carlos Prats]], Pinochet's predecessor as army commander, who had resigned rather than support the moves against Allende, had died in similar circumstances in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], two years earlier.

==Chilean foreign relations under Pinochet==
The new junta quickly broke off the diplomatic relations with [[Cuba]] that had been established under the Allende government. Having come to power with the self-proclaimed mission of fighting communism, Pinochet found common cause with the military dictatorships of [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]], and later, [[Argentina]]. The six countries eventually formulated a plan that became known as [[Operation Condor]], in which one country's security forces would target suspected Marxist &quot;subversives,&quot; guerrillas, and their sympathizers in the allied countries. After [[Orlando Letelier]]'s assassination in Washington, D.C. ([[September]] [[1976]]) the [[United States]] started opposing themselves to Condor operations abroad (phase 3), asking for the extradition of [[DINA]] agent [[Michael Townley]]. However, it wasn't until details of the plot leaked out after each of the regimes collapsed and the discovery of the &quot;[[terror archives]]&quot; in [[Paraguay]] that Condor came to be widely condemned as coordinated [[state terrorism]]. The military governments justified, however, the &quot;[[Dirty War]]&quot; by the imperative of stability during a time when many [[Urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] Marxist guerrillas were actively seeking to violently overthrow each country's respective government. In Argentina, for example, the &quot;[[doctrine of the two demons]]&quot; was created to justify this violent form of [[anti-communism]] that took place in the more general historic frame of the [[Cold War]].

Under Pinochet, Chile was the only country in Latin America not to support Argentina in its war with the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] over the [[Falkland Islands]] in 1982, after having almost started a war over a confrontation on some strategic islands.

Pinochet's government received tacit approval and material support from the [[United States of America]]. The exact nature and extent of this support is disputed. (''See'' [[Chilean coup of 1973#U.S. role in 1973 coup|U.S. role in 1973 Coup]], [[U.S. intervention in Chile]] and [[Operation Condor]] for more details.)

==End of the Pinochet regime==
In May 1983, the opposition and labor movements began to organize demonstrations and strikes against the regime, provoking violent responses from government officials. In 1986, security forces discovered 80 tons of weapons smuggled into the country by the [[Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front]] (FPMR), the armed branch of the outlawed [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]]. The shipment of [[Carrizal Bajo]] included C-4 [[plastic explosive]]s, [[RPG-7]] and [[M72 LAW]] rocket launchers as well as more than three thousand [[M16 (rifle)|M-16]] rifles. The operation was overseen by [[Cuba]]n intelligence, and also involved [[East Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]].   

In September, weapons from the same source were used in an unsuccessful [[assassination]] attempt against Pinochet by the FPMR. Pinochet suffered only minor injuries, but five of his military bodyguards were killed.

The beheading of Communists [[José Manuel Parada]], [[Manuel Guerrero]], and [[Santiago Nattino]] by the uniformed police ''(carabineros)'' led to the resignation of junta member General Mendoza on 1985.

According to the transitional provisions of the [[Constitution of Chile|1980 Constitution]], approved by 75% of voters in what has been said to be &quot;a highly irregular and undemocratic [[plebiscite]].&quot;{{ref|Hudson}}, a plebiscite was scheduled for [[October 5]], [[1988]], to vote on a new eight-year presidential term for Pinochet. The Constitutional Tribunal ruled that the plebiscite should be carried out as stipulated by the Law of Elections. That included an &quot;Electoral Space&quot; during which all positions, in this case two, ''Sí'' (yes), and ''No'', would have two free slots of equal and uninterrupted TV time, simultaneously broadcast by all TV channels, with no political advertising outside those spots. The allotment was scheduled in two off-prime time slots: one before the afternoon news and the other before the late-night news, from 22:45 to 23:15 each night (the evening news was from 20:30 to 21:30, and prime time from 21:30 to 22:30). The opposition ''No'' campaign, headed by [[Ricardo Lagos]], produced colorful, upbeat programs, telling the Chilean people to vote against the extension of the presidential term. Lagos, in an interview, called on Pinochet to account for all the &quot;disappeared&quot; persons. The ''Sí'' campaign did not argue for the advantages of extension, but was instead negative, claiming that voting &quot;no&quot; was equivalent to voting for a return to the chaos of the UP government.

In the plebiscite, 55% of the votes rejected the extension of the presidential term, against 42% for &quot;''Sí''&quot;, and again according to the provisions of the constitution, [[1989 Chilean presidential election|open presidential elections]] were held the next year, at the same time as congressional elections that would have taken place in either case. Pinochet left the presidency on [[March 11]], [[1990]].

Due to the transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, until March 1998. He was then sworn in as a senator-for-life, a privilege first granted to former presidents with at least six years in office by the [[Constitution of Chile|1980 constitution]]. His senatorship and consequent immunity from prosecution protected him, and legal challenges began only after Pinochet had been arrested in Britain.

==Arrest==
[[Image:Pinochet-Thatcher.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pinochet is visited by [[Margaret Thatcher]] during his house arrest in London, in 1998]]

While traveling abroad, Pinochet was arrested in October 1998 in [[London]], [[England]], under an international [[arrest warrant]] issued by judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] of [[Spain]], and he was placed under [[house arrest]]: initially in the clinic where he had just undergone back surgery, and later in a luxurious rented house. The charges included 94 counts of [[torture]] of Spanish citizens, and one count of conspiracy to commit torture. The government of Chile opposed his arrest, extradition to Spain, and trial.

There was a hard-fought 16-month legal battle in the House of Lords, the highest court of England, Pinochet claimed  immunity from prosecution as a former head of state. This was rejected, but the Lords decided that only crimes alleged to have been committed after the incorporation of the [[International Convention against Torture]] into English law in 1988 could be considered. This invalidated most, but not all, of the charges against him; but the outcome was that extradition could proceed.

There were then questions about Pinochet's allegedly fragile health. After medical tests, the Home Secretary [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]] ruled, despite the protests of legal and medical experts from several countries, that he should not be extradited, and on [[2 March]] [[2000]], he returned to Chile.

===Significance of the arrest===
Despite his release on grounds of ill-health, the unprecedented detention of Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, a senator and former head of state of Chile, in a foreign country, for crimes against humanity committed in his own country while he was head of state, without a warrant or request for extradition from his own country, marks a watershed in international law, one of the most important events since the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals. 

Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzón]]'s case was largely founded on the principle of [[universal jurisdiction]]&amp;mdash;that certain crimes are so egregious that they constitute crimes against humanity and can therefore be prosecuted in any court in the world. The British House of Lords ruled that Pinochet had no right to  immunity from prosecution as a former head of state, and could be put on trial. (''See'' [http://www.globalpolicy.org/intljustice/universal/2004/0524ripple.htm The Ripple Effect of the Pinochet Case].)

==Prosecution in Chile==
On [[August 8]] [[2000]], the [[Supreme court of Chile|Supreme Court of Justice]] voted 14 to 6 to strip Pinochet of his parliamentary immunity, and he was prosecuted. However, the cases were dismissed by the same Court, for medical reasons (vascular [[dementia]]), in July 2002. Shortly after the verdict, Pinochet resigned from the Senate and lived quietly. He rarely made public appearances and was notably absent from the events marking the 30th anniversary of the coup on [[September 11]], [[2003]]. Almost two years after his resignation, on [[May 28]], [[2004]], the Court of Appeals voted 14 to 9 to revoke Pinochet's dementia status and, consequently, his immunity from prosecution. In arguing their case, the prosecution presented a recent television interview Pinochet had made to a [[Miami]]-based television network. The judges found that the interview raised doubts about the mental incapacity of Pinochet.

On [[August 26]], [[2004]], in a 9 to 8 vote, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision that Pinochet should lose his senatorial immunity from prosecution. On [[December 2]], [[2004]], the Santiago Appeals Court stripped Pinochet of immunity from prosecution over the 1974 assassination of General [[Carlos Prats]], his predecessor as Army Commander-in-Chief, who was killed by a car bomb during exile in Argentina. On [[December 13]], [[2004]], [[Judge]] [[Juan Guzmán]] placed Pinochet under house arrest and indicted him over the disappearance of nine opposition activists and the killing of one of them during his regime. On [[March 24]], [[2005]], the Supreme Court reversed the Santiago Appeals Court ruling in the [[Carlos Prats]] case, and affirmed Pinochet's immunity in that particular case. In another case involving the killing of 119 dissidents, the Supreme Court decided to strip Pinochet of his immunity in a ruling issued on [[September 14]], 2005.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4246780.stm] The following day he was acquitted of the human rights case due to his ill health. Late in November of 2005, he was deemed fit to stand trial by the Chilean Supreme Court and was indicted on [[human rights]], for the disappearance of six dissidents arrested by Chile's security services in late 1974, and again placed under [[house arrest]], on the eve of his 90th birthday. (''See'' [[Operation Colombo]].)

===Tax fraud and foreign bank accounts===
A year long [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] investigatory committee released a report about [[Riggs Bank]] on [[July 15]], [[2004]], which had solicited Pinochet and controlled between USD $4 million and $8 million of his assets. According to the report, Riggs participated in [[money laundering]] for Pinochet, setting up offshore [[Shell company|shell corporations]] (referring to Pinochet as only &quot;a former public official&quot;), and hiding his accounts from regulatory agencies. The report said the violations were &quot;symptomatic of uneven and, at times, ineffective enforcement by all federal bank regulators, of bank compliance with their anti-money laundering obligations.&quot; Five days later, a Chilean court formally opened an investigation into Pinochet's finances for the first time, on allegations of fraud, misappropriation of funds, and bribery. Then, a few hours later, the state prosecutor, Chile's [[Chile State Defense Council|State Defense Council]] (''Consejo de Defensa del Estado)'', presented a second request for the same judge to investigate Pinochet's assets, but without directly accusing him of crimes. On [[October 1]], [[2004]], Chile's Internal Revenue Service (&quot;Servicio de Impuestos Internos&quot;) filed a lawsuit against Pinochet, accusing him of fraud and tax evasion, for the amount of USD $3.6 million in investment accounts at Riggs between 1996 and 2002. Pinochet could face fines totaling 300 percent of the amount owed, and prison time, if convicted. Aside from the legal ramifications, this evidence of financial impropiety has severely embarrassed Pinochet. According to the State Defense Council, his hidden assets could never have been acquired solely on the basis of his salary as President, Chief of the Armed Forces, and Life Senator. Late in November of 2005, he was deemed fit to stand trial by the Chilean Supreme Court and was indicted and put under house arrest on [[tax fraud]] and [[passport forgery]], but was released on bail; however he remained under house arrest, due to unrelated human rights charges.

On 23 February 2006 Augusto Pinochet's children Lucía, Jacqueline, Marco Antonio, Jacqueline and Verónica Pinochet; Augusto Pinochet's wife, Lucia Hiriart; a daughter-in-law; and Pinochet's personal secretary were indicted on charges of tax fraud, including failing to declare bank accounts overseas, and using false passports. Lucía flew to the US, but was detained and returned to Argentina, her country of departure, after attempting unsuccessfully to claim political asylum[http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/28/chile.pinochet/?section=cnn_topstories]. Further developments are to be expected (Feb 2006).

==Legacy==
Chileans remain deeply divided on his legacy. Some see him as a brutal dictator who ended democracy and led a regime characterized by torture and favoritism towards the rich, while others believe that he saved the country from communism and led the transformation of the Chilean economy into Latin America's most stable and fastest growing economy.

After a downturn at the end of the [[1960s]], Chile's economy entered a period of growth when Allende was elected. However, by the time the coup took place in 1973, the economy was in disarray. This was not entirely due to natural causes: in 1999 the US government released heavily censored versions of more than 1,100 previously classified documents from the CIA, defence and state department archives which detail efforts to provoke violent protests and economic chaos in Chile as part of US efforts to destabilise Allende's regime [http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,260382,00.html].

Things initially grew worse during beginning of Pinochet's rule. Unemployment, 4.4% in 1973, increased to 19.9% in 1976, and peaked at 30.4% in 1983 [http://www.unc.edu/home/pconway/aea2000/Chilemac.pdf]. By end of Pinochet's rule, Chile was experiencing high economic growth. An analysis of Pinochet's reforms show that at beginning of Pinochet's rule, Chile attracted massive foreign investment but that very little was invested in production. The price of Chile's exports fell and wages were reduced. [[Income distribution]] became more regressive, and both relative and actual poverty increased. Homelessness and malnutrition became more widespread, and there was a sharp increase in the [[infant mortality rate]]. Many small businesses went bankrupt whilst the economy, including newly-privatised industries, came to be dominated by monopolies with connections to the junta and by foreign corporations. [[Inflation]] peaked in 1976, but was then slashed, and the economy started to grow again towards the end of the [[1970s]]. Although unemployment remained high, poverty started to fall. However, a second recession hit Chile in 1982, and the economy did not start to grow again until 1986. Unemployment also started to decline, and had fallen to 7.8%  when Pinochet left power in 1990.

Any doubts about the human rights abuses carried out by the Pinochet regime have been stilled by several detailed reports and the emergence of evidence. In [[January 2005]], the Chilean Army accepted institutional responsibility for past abuses. Other institutions also accept that abuses took place, but blame them on individuals, rather than official policy. Lucía Pinochet Hiriart, Augusto Pinochet's eldest daughter,  said the use of torture during his 1973–90 regime was &quot;barbaric and without justification&quot;, after seeing the [[Valech Report]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Climate Change Attribution.png|250px|right|thumb|One [[global climate model]]'s reconstruction of temperature change during the 20th century as the result of five studied forcing factors and the amount of temperature change attributed to each.]]

'''Attribution of recent climate change''' attempts to discover what mechanisms are responsible for the observed changes in climate. The endeavour centers on the observed changes over the last century and in particular over the last 50 years, when observations are best and human influence greatest.

Over the past 150 years human activities have released increasing quantities of [[greenhouse gas]]es into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that theory and [[climate model]]s say should lead to increases in temperature - colloquially known as [[global warming]].  Other human effects are relevant&amp;mdash;for example, sulphate [[Particulate|aerosol]] are believed to lead to cooling&amp;mdash;and natural factors also act.

[[historical temperature record|Temperatures have risen in the last century]] (somewhere between 0.4 and 0.8 °C) and the proportion of this warming that is due to human influence is still open to question. The  current scientific consensus, as expressed in [[2001]] by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) and the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS), and recently confirmed by a joint statement of the [[G8]] academies of science, is that ''most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities''. 

A summary of IPCC climate research may be found in the [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/ IPCC assessment reports]; the NAS report and an overview of the report may be found [http://www4.nationalacademies.org/onpi/webextra.nsf/web/climate?OpenDocument here]; the degree of consensus is discussed at [[scientific opinion on climate change]].

== Attribution of 20th century climate change ==
The most fiercely-contested question in current climate change research is over attribution of climate change to either natural/internal or human factors over the period of the instrumental record - from about 1860, and especially over the last 50 years. In the 1995 second assessment report (SAR) the  [[IPCC]] made the widely quoted statement that &quot;The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate&amp;rdquo;. The phrase &quot;balance of evidence&quot; was used deliberately to suggest the (English) common-law standard of proof required in civil as opposed to criminal courts: not as high as &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. In 2001 the third assessment report (TAR) upgraded this by saying &quot;There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities&quot; [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/007.htm].

Over the past 5 decades there has been a warming of approximately 0.4°C at the Earth's surface (see [[historical temperature record]]). This warming might have been caused by internal variability, or by external forcing, or by &quot;greenhouse&quot; gases. Current studies indicate the latter is most likely, on the grounds that

* estimates of internal variability from climate models, and reconstructions of past temperatures, indicate that the warming is unlikely to be entirely natural
* climate models, forced by changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols, reproduce the observed global changes; those forced by natural factors alone do not
* &quot;fingerprint&quot; methods indicate that the pattern of change is closer to that expected from greenhouse gas forced change than from natural change [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/460.htm]

In 2001 the US [[National Academy of Sciences]] released a report supporting the IPCC's conclusions regarding the causes of recent climate change. It stated:
''&amp;#8220;Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth&amp;#8217;s atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise.  Temperatures are, in fact, rising.  The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes are also a reflection of natural variability.&amp;#8221;''[http://www4.nationalacademies.org/onpi/webextra.nsf/web/climate?OpenDocument][http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggccebro/chapter1.html][http://www.eldis.org/static/DOC8822.htm]

[[Global climate model]]s (GCM) do not incorporate the indirect [[solar forcing]] through modulation of cosmic ray flux (increased solar activity reduces cosmic ray flux and is speculated to modify cloud cover).  This is because there is no known mechanism for this effect; climate models cannot incorporate unknown mechanisms. One possible mechanism for the cosmic ray flux to influence climate is via [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/301/5641/1886 Particle Formation by Ion Nucleation in the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere ]''&quot;These findings indicate that, at typical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere conditions, particles are formed by this nucleation process and grow to measurable sizes with sufficient sun exposure and low preexisting aerosol surface area. Ion-induced nucleation is thus a globally important source of aerosol particles, potentially affecting cloud formation and radiative transfer. ... Atmospheric aerosols affect climate directly by altering the radiative balance of the Earth (1) and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) (2), which in turn change the number and size of cloud droplets and the cloud albedo&quot;''; however there is no agreement within the community for the correctness of this. 

Since GCM ''can'' reproduce observed temperature trends (including early 20th century changes, where solar forcing is non-negligible) there is no obvious need for a high sensitivity to solar forcing. Indeed, a significantly higher sensitivity to solar forcing would make early 20th century temperature change inexplicable.

=== Subsequent to the TAR ===
Following the publication of the TAR in 2001 &quot;detection and attribution&quot; of climate change has remained an active area of research. Some important results include:

* Multiple independent reconstructions of the [[temperature record of the past 1000 years]] confirm that the late 20th century is probably the warmest period in that time
* Two papers in Science in August 2005 [http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=170] [http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=179] resolve the problem, evident at the time of the TAR, of tropospheric temperature trends. The UAH version of the record contained errors, and there is evidence of spurious cooling trends in the radiosonde record, particularly in the tropics. See [[satellite temperature measurements]] for details.
* Barnett et al. &quot;Penetration of Human-Induced Warming into the World's Oceans&quot; (Science, Vol 309, Issue 5732, 284-287, [[8 July]] [[2005]]), say that the observed warming of the oceans ''cannot be explained by natural internal climate variability or solar and volcanic forcing, but is well simulated by two anthropogenically forced climate models. We conclude that it is of human origin, a conclusion robust to observational sampling and model differences'' [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/309/5732/284?rbfvrToken=478e88391c8e1ff344f98f5f5d3b62bac11e2a12].

== Detection and Attribution ==
Detection and attribution of climate signals, as well as its common-sense meaning, has a more precise definition within the climate change literature, as expressed by the IPCC [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/443.htm#1211].

''Detection'' of a signal requires demonstrating that an observed change is statistically significantly different than can be explained by natural internal variability. 

''Attribution'' is to demonstrate that a signal is 
* unlikely to be due entirely to internal variability;
* consistent with the estimated responses to the given combination of anthropogenic and natural forcing
* not consistent with alternative, physically plausible explanations of recent climate change that exclude important elements of the given combination of forcings.

Detection does not imply attribution, and is easier than attribution. Unequivocal attribution would require controlled experiments with multiple copies of the climate system, which is not possible. Attribution, as described above, can therefore only be done within some margin of error. For example, in the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|TAR]], the statement is made that ''most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is '''likely''' to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations'' where &quot;likely&quot; is quantified as 66-90% certain.

== Scientific literature and opinion ==
Some examples of published and informal support for the consensus view:

* The attribution of climate change is discussed extensively, with references to peer-reviewed research, in [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/439.htm chapter 12] of the IPCC TAR, which discusses [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/443.htm#1211 The Meaning of Detection and Attribution], [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/456.htm Quantitative Comparison of Observed and Modelled Climate Change], [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/458.htm Pattern Correlation Methods] and [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/460.htm Optimal Fingerprint Methods].

*An essay in [[Science (journal)|Science]] that surveyed [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686] of [[Abstract (summary)|abstracts]] related to climate change and concluded that most accepted the consensus is discussed further in [[scientific opinion on climate change]].

* A recent paper (Estimation of natural and anthropogenic contributions to twentieth century temperature change, Tett SFB et al., JGR 2002), says &quot;Our analysis suggests that the early twentieth century warming can best be explained by a combination of warming due to increases in greenhouse gases and natural forcing, some cooling due to other anthropogenic forcings, and a substantial, but not implausible, contribution from internal variability. In the second half of the century we find that the warming is largely caused by changes in greenhouse gases, with changes in sulphates and, perhaps, volcanic aerosol offsetting approximately one third of the warming.&quot; [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/sci.environment/msg/aa8521b67cd216ac?dmode=source]

* In 1996, in a paper in [[Nature]] entitled &quot;A search for human influences on the thermal structure of the atmosphere&quot;, [[Benjamin D. Santer]] et al. wrote: &quot;The observed spatial patterns of temperature change in the free atmosphere from 1963 to 1987 are similar to those predicted by state-of-the-art climate models incorporating various combinations of changes in carbon dioxide, anthropogenic sulphate aerosol and stratospheric ozone concentrations. The degree of pattern similarity between models and observations increases through this period. It is likely that this trend is partially due to human activities, although many uncertainties remain, particularly relating to estimates of natural variability.&quot;. This earlier work only addressed the most recent period. Estimates of natural variability matter for assessing the significance of the trend.

* Even some scientists noted for their somewhat doubtful view of global warming accept that recent climate change is mostly anthropogenic. [[John Christy]] said: &quot;...he supports the [http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/policy/climate_change_position.html AGU declaration], and is convinced that human activities are the major cause of the global warming that has been measured...&quot;

[[Willie Soon]] and [[Richard Lindzen]] say that there is insufficient proof for anthropogenic attribution.  For more information, see:

In [[economics]], '''adaptive expectations''' means that people form their expectations about what will happen in the future based on what has happened in the past.  For example, if inflation has been high in the past, people would expect it to be high in the future.

In the theory of [[inflation]], [[demand pull inflation]] and [[cost push inflation]] are usually short-lived  shocks. However, a series of such shocks may lead people to assume that inflation is a permanent feature of the economy (especially if the shocks are large). In that case they will modify their economic behaviour accordingly, based on their heightened expectation of future inflation rates. For instance, they may begin demanding larger (nominal) pay raises. This in itself acts as a cost push, leading firms to push their prices higher, especially since the firms themselves have similar expectations of inflation. This encourages another round of pay-raises.
This merges with the &quot;[[price/wage spiral]]&quot; to build some inflation directly into the economy. The combination of the price/wage spiral and inflationary expectations reflecting the recent past's experience with inflation gives an economy [[built-in inflation]]. 

The theory of adaptive expectations was popular in the 1980s, as an explanation of some aspects of the economic crisis that the West went through after the 1970s oil shock. The fact that some countries, particularly the UK, took until the 1990s to achieve stable low inflation rates again suggests there may well be something in the idea.

The theory of adaptive expectations can be stated using the following equation, where '''p&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;''' is the next year's rate of inflation that is currently expected; '''p&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is this year's rate of inflation that was expected last year; '''p''' is this year's actual rate of inflation, 

::'''p&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;''' = '''p&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;''' + '''&amp;lambda;'''*('''p''' &amp;ndash; '''p&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;''')

With '''&amp;lambda;''' is between 1 and 0, this says that current expectations of future inflation reflect past expectations and an &quot;error-adjustment&quot; term, in which current expectations are raised (or lowered) according to the gap between actual inflation and previous expectations.  This error-adjustment is also called &quot;''partial adjustment''.&quot; Rather than reflecting changing expectations of inflation, it may reflect the slow change in people's ability to ''act on'' changes in their expectations. 

Alternatively, the theory of adaptive expectations implies that current inflationary expectations equal: 

:: '''p&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;''' = (1 &amp;ndash; '''&amp;lambda;''')*&amp;Sigma; ('''&amp;lambda;&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;'''*'''p&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ndash;j&lt;/sub&gt;''')

where the summation (&amp;Sigma;) is over all '''j''' from 0 to infinity and '''p&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ndash;j&lt;/sub&gt;''' equals actual inflation '''j''' years in the past. Thus, current expected inflation reflects a weighted average all past inflation, where the weights get smaller and smaller as we move further in the past. 

An alternative theory of how expectations are formed is [[rational expectations]]. Though many macroeconomists saw the theory of rational expectations as a revolutionary improvement during the 1970s and 1980s, criticisms of that theory have encouraged a return to the adaptive expectations model.

The '''Mexican tetra''' (''Astyanax mexicanus'')  is a [[freshwater]] [[fish]]
of the [[characin]] [[family_(biology)|family]] (family [[Characidae]]) of
[[order_(biology)|order]] [[Characiformes]].  The [[type species]] of its [[genus]], it is native to the [[Nearctic]] [[ecozone]], originating in the lower [[Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River|Neueces]] and [[Pecos River]]s in [[Texas]] as well as the central and eastern parts of [[Mexico]].

Growing to a maximum overall length of 12&amp;nbsp;[[centimeter|cm]] (4.7&amp;nbsp;[[inch|in]]), the Mexican tetra is of typical characin shape, with unremarkable, drab coloration.  Its blind cave form, however, is notable for having no eyes and being [[albino]], that is, completely devoid of pigmentation; it has a pinkish-white color to its body.

This fish is reasonably popular among [[aquarium|aquarists]].  This is especially true of the blind cave form.

''A. mexicanus'' is a peaceful species that spends most of its time in the mid-level of the water above the rocky and sandy bottoms of pools and backwaters of creeks and rivers of its native environment.  Coming from a [[subtropical]] climate, it prefers water with 6.0&amp;ndash;7.8 [[pH]], a hardness of up to 30 [[dGH]], and a temperature range of 20 to 58 [[degree Celsius|&amp;deg;C]] (68 to 77 [[Fahrenheit|&amp;deg;F]]). In the winter it migrates to warmer waters.  Its natural diet consists of [[crustacean]]s, [[insect]]s, and [[annelid]]s, although in captivity it is [[omnivorous]].

The Mexican tetra is sometimes considered a subspecies of ''A. fasciatus,'' the [[banded tetra]].  The blind forms were once considered to constitute a separate genus, ''Anoptichthys.'' ''Anoptichthys jordani'' and ''Anoptichthys hubbsi'' are thus obsolete synonyms for ''Astyanax mexicanus.''

==Blind cave form==

''A. mexicanus'' is famous for its blind cave form, which is known by such names as '''blind cave tetra''', '''blind tetra''', and '''blind cavefish'''.  Some thirty distinct populations of Mexican tetras live in deep [[cave]]s and have lost the power of [[sight]] and even their [[eye]]s. These fish can still, however, find their way around by means of their [[lateral line]]s, which are highly sensitive to fluctuating [[water pressure]].

The eyed and eyeless forms of ''A. mexicanus,'' being members of the same species, are closely related and can interbreed.  A recent study (Dowling, Martasian, and Jeffery) suggests that there are at least two distinct genetic lineages among the blind populations, arguing that these represent a case of [[convergent evolution]].

In one experiment, scientists implanted into the eye of the blind ''A. mexicanus'' the eye lens from an eyed ''A. mexicanus''.  Within eight days the blind ''A. mexicanus'' started to develop an eye.  After two months it developed a working eye complete with an iris, cornea, and pupil.

The blind Mexican tetra is often held up as one of the proofs of the theory of [[evolution]].  However, opponents of evolutionary theory argue that the blind form is a ''loss of information'' (for sight), compatible with a deterioration of creation after the [[Fall of Man]], so cannot explain how the sight evolved in the first place.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''atom probe''' is an atomic-resolution [[microscope]] used in [[materials science]] that was invented in [[1967]] by [[Erwin Müller]].

Müller's atom probe made one-dimensional compositional maps by combining [[time-of-flight]] [[Mass spectrometry|spectroscopy]] and [[field ion microscope|field ion microscopy]] (FIM).  The instrument now allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of up-to hundreds-of-millions of [[atom|atoms]] from a sharp tip (corresponding to specimen volumes of 10,000-1,000,000 [[nanometer|nm]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

As in FIM, a sharp tip is made, placed in [[ultra high vacuum]] at cryogenic temperature (typically 20-100 K). Individual atoms at the surface of the tip are ionized, either by a positive pulsed voltage or a laser.  These ions are repelled from the tip electrostatically.  A fast timing circuit is used to measure the time taken between the pulse and the impact of the ion on a detector, thus allowing the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion to be calculated and, therefore, the element (or elements) of the ion. From the collection of many of these ions, a chemical profile of the sample can be made with relative position accuracy of less than one atomic spacing.

Atom-Probe Tomography (APT) uses a position-sensitive detector to deduce the lateral location of atoms.  It was invented in [[1988]] by [[Alfred Cerezo]], [[Terence Godfrey]], and [[George D. W. Smith]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:CaponeMugShot.jpg|200px|right|frame|FBI [[mugshot]] of Capone, 1931]]

'''Alphonse Gabriel Capone''' ([[January 17]], [[1899]] &amp;ndash; [[January 25]], [[1947]]), popularly known as '''Al &quot;Scarface&quot; Capone''', was an infamous [[United States|American]] [[gangster]] in the 1920s and 1930s, although his business card reportedly described him as a used [[furniture]] dealer. A [[Naples|Neapolitan]] born in [[New York]], Capone began his career in [[Brooklyn]] before moving to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and becoming Chicago's most notorious [[crime]] figure. By the end of the 1920s, the [[FBI|Federal Bureau of Investigation]] had placed Capone on its &quot;[[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Most Wanted]]&quot; list. Capone's downfall occurred in 1931 when he was indicted and convicted by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] for [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|income tax evasion]] and sent to the notorious island prison [[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]].

==Birth and early life==
'''''Alphonse Capone''''' was born to Gabriele Capone (1865&amp;ndash;1920) and his wife Teresina &quot;T(h)eresa&quot; Raiola ([[December 28]], [[1867]]&amp;ndash;1952) in [[Brooklyn, New York]], at the turn of the [[20th century]].  Gabriele was a [[barber]] from [[Castellammare di Stabia]], a village about twenty-five kilometers south of [[Naples]], [[Italy]]. Teresina was a [[seamstress]] and the daughter of Angelo Raiola from [[Angri]], a town in the province of [[Salerno]]. The Capones emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1894, and settled in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] neighborhood in Brooklyn. 

The couple had seven sons and two daughters:

*Vincenzo Capone (1892&amp;ndash;[[October 1]], [[1952]]).  Called James Vincenzo Capone upon entering the United States. He left the family in 1908 to join a [[Circus (performing art) | circus]] operating in the [[Midwest]]. Served as a [[lieutenant]] in the [[U.S. Army]] during [[World War I]]. Apparently changed his name to Richard Joseph Hart shortly after his discharge. He had a career as a  [[law enforcement officer]], served in the [[Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs]]  and later became [[Marshal]] in [[Homer, Nebraska]].
*Raffaele Capone (1894&amp;ndash;[[November 22]], [[1974]]). Called Ralph upon entering the United States. Later joined his younger brother in Chicago.
*Salvatore Capone (1895&amp;ndash;[[April 1]], [[1924]]). Better known as Frank Capone, he was a representative of his brother in [[Cicero, Illinois]]. Killed by members of the local police reportedly for attempting to draw a gun while they approached him.
*Alphonse Gabriel Capone ([[January 17]], [[1899]]&amp;ndash;[[January 25]], [[1947]]).
*Erminio Capone (1901&amp;ndash;?). Called John or affectionately &quot;Mimi.&quot; Served prison terms for minor offenses such as [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]]. Changed his last name to &quot;Martin.&quot; Reportedly still alive in 1994.
* Umberto Capone (1906&amp;ndash;June, [[1980]]). Called Albert. Employee of the newspaper ''Cicero Tribune'' under the ownership of his brother Al. Changed his last name to Raiola in 1942.
*Amedeo Capone (1908&amp;ndash;[[January 31]], [[1967]]). Called Matthew. [[Tavern]] owner.
*Rose Capone.
*Mafalda Capone.

Alphonse's life of [[crime]] started early: as a teenager he joined two gangs, the Brooklyn Rippers and the Forty Thieves Juniors, and engaged in petty crime.

Capone quit high school at the age of 14 when he fought with a teacher and worked odd jobs around Brooklyn, including a [[candy]] store and a [[bowling alley]].  After his initial stint with small-time gangs, Capone joined the notorious [[Five Points Gang]] headed by [[Frankie Yale|Frankie Yale]].  It was at this time he began working as a [[bartender]] and [[Doorman|bouncer]] at Yale's establishment, the seedy Harvard Inn. It was here, at the Harvard Inn, that Capone would engage in a knife fight with a thug named Frank Gallucio after Capone had made a bold move on Gallucio's sister. Gallucio had deeply slashed Capone's right cheek with a switchblade, earning him the nickname that he would bear for the rest of his life: &quot;Scarface,&quot; a moniker he in fact detested. Capone had instead preferred the nickname &quot;Snorky&quot; which meant &quot;well-dressed&quot; in the slang of the 1920s.

In 1918 Capone married [[Mae Coughlin]], an [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]] girl, who gave him a son that year, [[Sonny Capone|Albert &quot;Sonny&quot; Francis Capone]]. The couple lived in [[Brooklyn]] for a year. In 1919 he lived in [[Amityville]], [[Long Island]], to be close to &quot;Rum Row.&quot; Capone was still working for Frankie Yale and is thought to have committed at least two homicides before he was sent to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in 1919.  Yale sent his protégé to Chicago after Capone was involved in a fight with a rival gang. Yale's intention was for Capone to &quot;cool off&quot; there; the move primed one of the most notorious crime careers in modern American history.

==Capone in Chicago==
The Capone family moved to a small, unassuming house at 7244 South Prairie Avenue in a [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] suburb that would serve as Al Capone's first headquarters.  Initially, Capone took up grunt work with [[Johnny Torrio]]'s outfit, but the elder Torrio immediately recognized Capone's talents and by 1922 Capone was Torrio's second in command, responsible for much of the [[gambling]], [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], and [[prostitution]] [[Racket (crime) | racket]]s in the city of Chicago. 

Severely injured in an assassination attempt in 1925, the shaken Torrio returned to [[Italy]] and gave the reins of the business to Capone.  Capone was notorious during [[Prohibition]] for his control of the Chicago underworld and his bitter rivalries with gangsters such as [[Bugs Moran]] and [[Hymie Weiss]].  Raking in vast amounts of money from illegal gambling, prostitution, and alcohol (some estimates were that between 1925 and 1930 Capone was making $100 million a year), the Chicago [[kingpin]] was largely immune to prosecution due to [[witness intimidation]] and the bribing of city officials, such as Chicago mayor [[William Hale Thompson|William &quot;Big Bill&quot; Hale Thompson]].  Capone was reputed to have several other retreats and hideouts including [[French Lick, Indiana]], [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee]].

In 1928, Capone bought a retreat on [[Palm Island, Florida|Palm Island]], [[Florida]].  It was shortly after this purchase that he orchestrated seven of the most notorious gangland killings of the century, the 1929 [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]].  Although details of the massacre are still in dispute, and no person has ever been charged or prosecuted for the crime, the killings are generally linked to Capone and his henchmen, especially [[Jack McGurn|Jack &quot;Machine Gun&quot; McGurn]], who is thought to have led the operation.  By staging the massacre, Capone was trying to dispose of his arch-rival [[Bugs Moran]], who controlled gang operations on the North Side of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].  Moran himself was late for the meeting and escaped otherwise certain death.

Throughout the 1920s, Capone himself was often the target of attempted murders.

==Fall of Capone== 
Although Capone always did his business through front men and had no accounting records linking him to his earnings, new laws enacted in 1927 allowed the federal government to pursue Capone on [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]], their best chance of finally convicting him. Pursuing Capone were Treasury agent [[Eliot Ness]] and his hand picked team of incorruptible [[U.S. Treasury]] agents &quot;[[The Untouchables]]&quot; and [[US Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] agent [[Frank Wilson(IRS Agent)|Frank Wilson]], who was able to find receipts linking Capone to illegal gambling income and evasion of taxes on that income.

[[Image:Capone_prison.jpg|right|frame|Capone after his release from prison. FBI file photo.]]

The trial and indictment occurred in 1931.  Initially, Capone pleaded guilty to the charges, hoping for a [[plea bargain]].  But, after the judge refused his [[lawyer]]'s offers and Capone's associates failed to bribe or tamper with the [[jury]], Al Capone was found guilty on five of twenty-three counts and sentenced to eleven years in a federal prison. 

Capone was first sent to an [[Atlanta]] prison in 1932.  However, the mobster was still able to control most of his interests from this facility, and he was ordered to be transferred to the infamous [[California]] island prison of [[Alcatraz]] in August of 1934. Here, Capone was strictly guarded and prohibited from any contact with the outside world.  With the repeal of Prohibition and the arrest and confinement of its leader, the Capone empire soon began to wither. At [[Alcatraz]], Capone went in with his cocky attitude. However, when he attempted to bribe guards, he was sent to the &quot;hole&quot;, or solitary confinement. The same also stood for socializing, and eventually Capone's mental stability began to deteriorate. One example of his erratic behavior was that he would make his bed and then undo it, continuing this pattern for hours. Sometimes, Capone did not even want to leave his cell at all, crouching in a corner of his cell and talking to himself in gibberish. He began telling people that he was being haunted by the ghost of James Clark, a victim in the [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]. It was apparent over time that Capone no longer posed any threat of resuming his previous gangster-related activities.

== Death and aftermath ==
Sometime in the mid-1930s, and at [[Alcatraz]], Capone began showing signs of dementia, probably related to a case of untreated [[syphilis]] he had contracted as a young man. He spent the last year of his sentence in the prison hospital, and was released late in 1939.  After spending a year in residential treatment at a hospital in [[Baltimore]], he retired to his estate in [[Miami, Florida]].  

Capone was now a broken man. He no longer controlled any [[mafia]] interests. On January 21, 1947, he had an [[Apoplexy|apoplectic stroke]]. He regained consciousness and started to feel better when [[pneumonia]] set in on January 24.  The next day he died from cardiac arrest. Capone was initially buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Chicago's far South Side between the graves of his father, Gabriele, and brother, Frank, but in March of 1950 the remains of all three were moved to Mount Carmel Cemetery on the far West Side.[[Hillside, Illinois]].

== Popular culture ==
Notorious as one of the most well known, yet, popular [[American gangsters]] of the [[20th century]], Capone has been the subject of numerous articles, books, and films.  He has been portrayed on screen by [[Nicholas Kokenes]], [[Wallace Beery]], [[Paul Muni]], [[Barry Sullivan]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Neville Brand]], [[Jason Robards]], [[Ben Gazzara]], [[Robert De Niro]] and [[William Forsythe]].  Capone and his [[era]] were highlighted in the 1959 [[television film]] ''[[The Untouchables]]'' and its [[feature film]] and [[television series]] [[remake]]s which has created the popular myth of the personal war between the crime lord and [[Eliot Ness]]. He has also featured as an off-screen character (in a deleted scene that was added to the DVD release) in the 2002 film ''[[Road to Perdition]]'', the comic book, ''[[Tintin in America]]'' as the only real person ever to appear in [[The Adventures of Tintin]] in character and as a ghost in [[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s ''[[The Night's Dawn Trilogy]]'' science fiction novels. Capone is also the subject of [[Prince Buster]] song ''Al Capone'' and is also the namesake of [[Rancid|Rancid's]] ''Young Al Capone''.

Tunnels found under the city of [[Moose Jaw]], [[Saskatchewan]] are said to have been another hideout of Capone's.  The tunnels are a very popular tourist attraction, due in part to the alleged link to Capone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''amplifier''' can be considered to be ''any'' [[device]] that uses a small amount of energy to control a larger amount, although the term today usually refers to an [[electronics|electronic]] amplifier.  The relationship of the input to the output of an amplifier — usually expressed as a function of the input frequency — is called the [[transfer function]] of the amplifier, and the magnitude of the transfer function is termed the [[gain]]. 
== General characteristics of amplifiers ==
Most amplifiers can be characterised by a number of parameters.

=== Gain ===
How much an amplifier increases the signal level is called the [[gain]]. This is usually measured in [[decibel]]s (dB).
Mathematically speaking, the gain is equal to the output level divided by the input level.

=== Output [[dynamic range]] ===
This is the range usually quoted in dB between the lowest useful output and the largest useful output level. Since the lowest useful level is limited by output noise, this is quoted as the amplifier dynamic range.

=== Bandwidth and rise time ===
The [[bandwidth]] BW of an amplifier is usually defined as the difference between the lower and upper [[half power point]]s. This is therefore also known as the −3 dB BW. Bandwidths for other response tolerances are sometimes quoted (−1 dB, −6 dB etc.

As an example, a good audio amplifier will have a −3 dB BW  from around twenty hertz to about twenty kilohertz (the range of normal human hearing).

The [[rise time]] of an amplifier is the time taken for the out put to change from 10% to 90% of its final level when driven by a step input.
For a [[Gaussian response]] system (or a simple RC roll off), the rise time is given by :

Tr = BW/0.35

where BW is in [[hertz|Hz]] and Tr is in [[second]]s

=== Settling time and aberrations ===
Time taken for output to settle to within a certain percentage of the final value (say 0.1%). This is usually specified in oscilloscope vertical amplifiers and high accuracy measurement systems.

=== Slew rate ===
[[Slew rate]] is the maximum rate of change of output variable, usually quotes in volts per second (or microsecond).

=== Sine wave distortion ===
The properties of amplifier circuits distort the signal. This distortion comes in several forms including [[harmonic distortion]] and [[intermodulation distortion]].

Harmonic distortion is fairly easy to measure. The amplifier output is connected to a [[spectrum analyzer]], (a device which graphs frequency against amplitude). Then  a pure tone is applied to the amplifier input. Typically a sinusoidal signal of 1 kHz is used. The largest signal on your analyzer should be the input signal at 1 kHz. You will sometimes see humps at even intervals along the graph at even multiples of that base signal. These are the harmonics. The [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD) is the sum of these components relative to the signal.

=== Noise ===
How much noise is introduced by the amplification process? This is an undesirable thing that is the inevitable result of the electronics devices and components. It is measured in either decibels or the peak output voltage produced by the amp when no signal is applied.

=== Efficiency ===
How much of the input power is usefully applied to the amplifier's output? Class A amplifiers are very inefficient, in the range of 10–20% with a max efficiency of 25%. Modern Class AB amps are commonly between 35–55% efficient with a theoretical maximum of 78.5%. Commercially available class D amplifiers have reported efficiencies as high as 97%. The efficiency of the amplifier limits the amount of total power output that is usefully available. Note that more efficient amps run much cooler, and often do not need any fans even in multi-kilowatt designs.

== Electronic amplifiers ==
{{main|electronic amplifier}}
There are numerous types of electronic amplifier depending upon the application.

The most common type of amplifier is the electronic amplifier, commonly used in [[radio]] and [[television]] [[transmitter|transmitters]] and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], [[high-fidelity]] (&quot;hi-fi&quot;) stereo equipment, microcomputers and other electronic digital equipment, and [[guitar]] and other [[instrument amplifier]]s. Its critical components are [[active device]]s, such as [[vacuum tube]]s or [[transistor]]s.

=== Class ===
Amplifiers are commonly classified by the conduction angle of the input signal through the amplifying device; see [[electronic amplifier]].

Where efficiency is not a consideration, most small signal linear amplifiers are designed as class A,  which means that one active device amplifies all portions (360deg) of the input signal. 

Class B transmits 180deg of the input signal to the output with each device. Class AB transmits between 180 and 360 degrees selected by the amplifier creator.  These classes are usually used in efficient low frequency amplifiers (such as audio and hi-fi) owing to their relatively high efficiency, or other designs where both linearity is important and efficiency is important (cell phones, cell towers, TV transmitters). Another popular RF amplifier class is Class C which means that they amplify less than 180&amp;deg; of the input signal. The signal is restored to almost sinusoidal shape by the tuned circuit, and efficiency is higher than A, AB or B classes of amplification, but linearity is very poor.  

There are non-linear, or switch mode amplifiers that are popular in applications where efficiency and raw power generation is important.  Class D, E, F are popular switch mode amplifiers.  There are methods of making them linear, but linearity is generally even less than the linear modes of operation.  Common switch mode applications are Audio subwoofers, AM and FM radio transmitters, and some long battery life cellphones.

=== Vacuum tube (valve) amplifiers ===
{{main|valve amplifier}}

Today most sound systems use [[transistor]] amplifiers for economic reasons, but valve amplifiers remain popular for guitar amplification, for &quot;high end&quot; [[hi-fi]] systems and analog production and replay equipment in [[recording studio]]s.

Valve amplifiers are widely, but not always correctly, associated with the [[valve sound]]. Some claim this sound has more to do with the circuit topology and circuit design of the amplifier, than to the use of valves rather than transistors as the active gain devices. In the earlier years of audio, [[vacuum tube]]s filled the active device role.

=== Transistor amplifiers ===
:''Main articles: [[transistor]], [[bipolar junction transistor]], [[MOSFET]]''

The essential role of this active element is to magnify an input signal to yield a significantly larger output signal. The amount of magnification (the &quot;forward gain&quot;) is determined by the external circuit design as well as the active device. 

Many common active devices in transistor amplifiers are [[bipolar junction transistor]]s ([[BJT]]s) and [[metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor]]s ([[MOSFET]]s).  

Allpications are numerous, some common examples are audio amplifiers in a home stereo or PA system, RF high power generation for semiconductor equipment, to RF and Microwave amplification in a cell phone.

=== Operational amplifiers (op-amps) ===
:''Main articles: [[operational amplifier]], [[instrumentation amplifier]]''

An operational amplifier is a solid state integrated circuit amplifier which employs external feedback for control of its transfer function or [[gain]]

===Musical instrument amplifiers===
See main page: [[instrument amplifier]].

===Audio amplifier===
An audio amplifier is usually used to amplify signals such as music or speech.
{{Main|Audio amplifier}}
=== Carbon microphone ===
One of the first devices to amplify signals was the carbon [[microphone]]. By channeling a large electric current through the compressed [[carbon]] granules in the microphone, a small sound signal could produce a much larger electric signal. The carbon microphone was extremely important in early telecommunications until other types of amplifiers were available.

== Other amplifier types ==

=== Magnetic amplifier ===
{{main|magnetic amplifier}}
A '''magnetic amplifier''' is a [[transformer]]-like device that makes use of the saturation of magnetic materials to produce amplification. It is a non-electronic electrical amplifier with no moving parts. The [[bandwidth]] of magnetic amplifiers extends to the tens of kilohertz.

An [[Amplidyne]] or [[Rototrol]] is a rotating machine like an [[electrical generator]] that provides amplification of electrical signals  by conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy.

=== Optical amplifiers ===
{{main|Optical amplifier}}

'''Optical amplifiers''' amplify [[light]], through the process of [[stimulated emission]].
=== Miscellaneous types ===
*There are also mechanical amplifiers, such as the automotive [[servomechanism|servo]] used in [[brake|braking]].
*[[Relays]] can be included under the above definition of amplifiers, although their transfer function is not [[linear]] (that is, they are either open or closed).
*Another type of amplifier is the [[fluidic amplifier]], based on the [[fluidic triode]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''astable''' [[multivibrator]] is an [[electronic circuit]] that has two states, neither one which is stable.  The circuit therefore behaves as an [[oscillator]].  The time spent in each state is usually controlled by the charging (or discharging) of a [[capacitor]] through a [[resistor]]. 
There are several types of astables, and they can be made in many different ways. Some are made from [[NOR]] gates while others are made from dedicated timer chips.

'''''Army of Darkness''''' (also known as '''''Medieval Dead''''') ([[1993]]) is the third installment of the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' film trilogy, written and directed by [[Sam Raimi]] and starring [[Bruce Campbell]]. This movie takes a more humorous bent than its predecessors.

The advertising [[tagline]] was &quot;Trapped in Time. Surrounded by Evil. Low on Gas.&quot;

The movie had a considerably higher budget than the prior two ''Evil Dead'' films. The budget was estimated to be around $11 million; ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' had a budget of $3.5 million and ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' a budget of $350,000.

At the box office, the film was not a big success, only grossing $11,501,093 domestically.  After its video release, however, it has obtained an ever-growing cult following, along with the other two films in the trilogy.

The movie has become a [[cult film|cult classic]], and quotes and tributes have even found their way into video games such as ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', ''[[Blood (computer game)|Blood]]'', [[Warcraft III]] and [[World of Warcraft]].

==Plot==

{{spoiler}}

The protagonist, [[Ash Williams|Ash]] (Campbell), who discovered the [[Necronomicon]] ex Mortis, or &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; that unleashed demonic forces in the previous films ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' and ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', is sucked into a time vortex with his [[Oldsmobile]], an event caused by reading the spell to defeat the demons. He ends up in England in AD 1300, where he is believed to be the &quot;Hero From The Sky,&quot; the man destined to deliver mankind to salvation from the &quot;Deadites,&quot; or the undead.

The only way to return to his time and stop the Deadites is to retrieve the Necronomicon, which contains both spells. While preparing for this, Ash becomes romantically involved with a local woman, Sheila ([[Embeth Davidtz]]). 

When Ash is unable to recall the precise words needed to safely retrieve the Necronomicon, he inadvertently unleashes the forces of the Deadites, who are led by an evil clone of Ash. 
Despite causing the predicament faced by the humans, Ash initially demands to be returned to his own time. When Sheila is captured by a flying Deadite, he becomes determined to lead the humans against the Deadite army. Reluctantly the people agree to join Ash.

Using scientific knowledge from the future from chemistry and engineering books in the trunk of his Oldsmobile, Ash successfully leads the humans to defeat the Deadites and save Sheila. Subsequently he is sent back to the present but once again he is unable to recall the correct words used for the incantation, allowing a Deadite to follow him through time.

==Alternate endings==
The movie has two distinct endings, both of which are covered on the movie's [[DVD]].  The more familiar ending picks up after Ash has returned to the present, in which he stages one final confrontation with the &quot;she-bitch&quot; in the S-Mart Housewares Department.  This is the version shown in theatres and on [[television]].

The alternate ending, which was supposedly favored by director [[Sam Raimi]], depicts Ash as he races toward a cave to drink the [[potion|magic potion]].  Apparently, Ash drinks too much of the potion and sleeps well beyond his time and awakens in a post-[[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[Earth]].  This ending was cut, however, after critics showed their displeasure with the juxtaposition of such a quirky movie with a morbid ending.

==Trivia==
*The mystical phrase Ash is supposed to speak when he takes the [[Necronomicon]], &quot;Clatto Verata Nicto&quot; (As it is in the script) is a reference to the classic [[science fiction]] film ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]''. In the film, the phrase &quot;[[Klaatu barada nikto]]&quot; is used to cancel the robot Gort's attack.

*[[Bruce Campbell]] sustained an injury on the set when a piece of armor made a gash in his chin.  When he was rushed to the emergency room, he was still in his costume and make-up.  The physicians had to ask which cut was the real one!

*The film was mostly shot in the Nevada desert near Las Vegas.

*The plot of the film was originally meant for ''[[Evil Dead II]]''. During pre-production, the plot of ''Evil Dead II'' involved the evil force from the end of the first film hitting Ash and sending him back to 1300 AD where he would destroy the book. Promotional drawings were created and published in ''Variety'' during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot. The working title at the time? ''Evil Dead II: Army of Darkness''.

*In the opening scene when Bruce tells the story so far, you can see the support cable he was attached to as he was being sucked into the portal from the cabin. This was obviously overlooked by the film's editors and can still be clearly seen on television (on rotation on the [[SciFi Channel]].) to this day.

*The film was edited into multiple cuts to meet with the motion picture standards which differ around the world. The original ending, which can be seen on some special edition dvds of the film was deemed to be depressing by the movie studio, and so a new happier ending was written for the film, to the dismay of the director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell.

*Anyone who has played the successful [[Duke Nukem 3D]] can see the uncanny similarities it shares with various cult movies, such as [[They Live]] and Army of Darkness. The vast majority of the game's main character's lines were clearly taken from the movie (lines such as 'groovy,' 'gimme some sugar baby,' 'hail to the king,' 'come get some,' 'this is my BOOM STICK!',and others). The official movie poster, when compared to the game's box cover, is also a dead giveaway. These obvious take-offs were not seen as homages by star Bruce Campbell, but more as a rip-off, according to comments printed in [[IGN for Men]]: &quot;...they're rip-off artists. Let them get their own damn material. It's called hiring a writer. They're blatantly ripping it off and if I was any kind of litigious guy they would've gotten a phone call by now. It's depressing and I think it's wrong. That's why [[Tachyon: The Fringe]] will kick little Duke's ass any day.&quot; --Bruce Campbell

*Director [[Peter Jackson]] pays [[homage]] to ''Army of Darkness'' in ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy]]'' in two scenes. Similar dialog is used between the scene where the humans declare their support for Ash and the scene where the ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' is first formed. Also, the wiseman brings a portion of newly created [[gunpowder]] close to a naked flame but Ash abruptly moves it away. A similar scene occurs in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]'' between [[Wormtongue]] and [[Saruman]].

*The 1997 [[PlayStation]] video game [[Herc's Adventures]] published by [[Lucas Arts]] pay homage to &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; in several scenes.  When you die and end up in [[Hades]] skeletons will crawl up to you and shout &quot;I'll cut yer gizzard out&quot; and for numerous cemetery scenes with skeletal hands jumping out and grabbing you.

*In [[Texas]], there is an actual S-Mart store, where you can ask for the &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; tour which is a tour of the store, including Ash's specialty, housewares.

*In [[Oregon]] there is another actual S-Mart store, just north of Ashland on [[Interstate 5]].

*The Christian band [[Dogwood (band)|Dogwood]] have a quote of Ash's speech at the castle in the title track off the album 'Building a better me' from 1:46 — 1:55 (“Go ahead and run.  Run home and cry to mama.  Me!  I’m through runnin’”)

*The progressive rock band [[Coheed and Cambria]] also feature a quote from Ash's castle speech during the introduction of the acoustic version of their song 'Junesong Provision' (&quot;Now listen up, you primitive screwheads. See this? This... is my boomstick!&quot;)

*Instrumental rock band [[The Magic Elf]] uses an audio excerpt from the film on the album 'Heavy Meddle'. The line spoken by the skeleton general (Evil Ash) to his &quot;men&quot; just before the battle scene - &quot;bring me forth into the castle...forward!&quot; - precedes the first track on the album. 

*The rock band [[Showbread (band)|Showbread]] wrote the song 'Dead by Dawn' about the Evil Dead trilogy.  The song lyrics are largely quoted directly from the movies.  

*The outro to the final track (Orgiastic Disembowelment) on the &quot;None So Vile&quot; cd by the death metal band [[Cryptopsy]] features the same quote as the [[Dogwood (band)|Dogwood]] song.

*In the Director's Cut, Ash's response to Evil Ash (after shooting him in the face) is &quot;I ain't that good.&quot; This was replaced by what is perhaps one of the most memorable of all of Ash's lines: &quot;Good... Bad... I'm the guy with the gun.&quot; The original line, however, slipped into at least one dubbed version of the released film, with the spanish line being &quot;No soy tan bueno&quot;, a direct translation of it.

*In the castle battle, one of the deadites says &quot;It's the one in the cart that we want!&quot; However, due to the ambiant noise of the scene, it can be very easy to mistake the word &quot;cart&quot; for &quot;car&quot;. This has led to many confused fans wondering how a medieval Deadite could know about a car.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Asroclauncher.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An older &quot;Matchbox&quot; ASROC launcher, phased out in the 1990s]]
'''ASROC''' (for '''Anti-Submarine ROCket''') is an antisubmarine [[missile]] system, developed by the [[United States Navy]], and installed on over 200 surface ships, generally [[cruiser (warship)|cruisers]] and [[destroyer]]s.  A surface ship first detects an enemy [[submarine]] by using [[sonar]], then fires an ASROC missile, which has a [[torpedo]] or [[depth charge]] on the tip, toward the target.  Once the missile's [[rocket]] motor stops firing, the torpedo breaks away and a [[parachute]] slows it down until it enters the water.  The torpedo's motor then activates and the torpedo, which is guided by its own sonar system, homes in on the target and explodes.  (Alternatively, if the missile is instead equipped with a depth charge, it merely sinks to a predetermined depth and then explodes.)  An ASROC missile can carry either a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] or conventional explosive, although the nuclear depth charges were phased out by the [[1990s]].

The first ASROC system, using the MK-112 &quot;Matchbox&quot; launcher, was developed in the [[1950s]] and installed in the [[1960s]].  This system was phased out in the [[1990s]] and replaced with the Vertical Launch ASROC, or &quot;VLA&quot;.

[[Image:VLAlaunch.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Launch of a Vertical Launch ASROC]]
The VLA missile is a rocket-propelled, three-stage, [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) weapon designed for deployment on [[Ticonderoga class cruiser|''Ticonderoga''-class cruisers]], [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyers]], and [[Spruance class destroyer|''Spruance''-class destroyers]] equipped with the MK41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) and MK 116 [[fire-control system|fire control system]]. The VLA missile provides the fleet with the capability for rapid response, all weather delivery of a MK 46 torpedo against threat submarines in any direction at intermediate ranges. VLA missiles were introduced into the fleet in [[1993]] as a baseline weapon for the cruisers and [[destroyer]]s equipped with the [[Aegis combat system]] and as a replacement for the ASROC weapon on [[Spruance class destroyer|''Spruance''-class destroyers]] when the original ASROC launchers were replaced by the MK 41 VLS. 

VLA missiles were first introduced with the MK 46 [[torpedo]] as its payload (RUM139A). In [[1996]] an upgrade was implemented to allow the enhanced shallow-water capable MK 46 to be incorporated as the VLA missile payload (RUM139B). VLA missiles are delivered to the fleet as All-Up-Rounds (AURs) which consist of the VLA missile installed inside of a MK15 VLS canister. VLA missiles have two basic fleet configurations, Warshot and Exercise. VLA Warshot missiles contain a MK46 warshot torpedo. VLA Exercise missiles contain an exercise torpedo, and are used for fleet exercise firings.

=== General Characteristics of the VLA===

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Ahmed al-Nami.png|right|framed|This photograph of Ahmed al-Nami was released by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in the days following the attack.]]
'''Ahmed Abdallah al-Nami ''' (&amp;#1575;&amp;#1581;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1583; &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1606;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1610;, also [[transliteration|transliterated]] '''Alnami''' or '''al-Nawi''') (born December [[1977]]) was named by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] as one of the [[Organizers of the September 11, 2001 attacks|hijackers]] of [[United Airlines flight 93]] as part of the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]]. 

==History==
Born in [[Saudi Arabia]], al-Nami served as a [[muezzin]] at the Seqeley mosque after having reportedly become very religious sometime in early [[1999]]. That autumn he enrolled in the [[King Khaled University]] at [[Abha]] to study [[Sharia]], he left his family home in [[Khamis Mushayt]] in the summer of [[2000]] to complete the [[Hajj]], but never returned - instead travelling to the [[Al Farouk training camp]] in [[Afghanistan]] where he meets  and befriends [[Waleed al-Shehri|Waleed]] and [[Wail al-Shehri]], two brothers from Khamis Mushayt, and [[Saeed Alghamdi]]. The four reportedly pledge themselves to [[Jihad]] in the Spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail - who had dubbed himself ''Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi'' after one of [[Mohammad]]'s companions.[http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/driving_a_wedge/part1_side.shtml]

During his time at Al-Farooq, there is a curious mention under [[Mushabib al-Hamlan]]'s details that al-Nami had recently had [[laser eye surgery]], an uncited fact that does not reappear. 

By October he had taken a prospective hijacker [[Mushabib al-Hamlan]] from [[Afghanistan]] to Saudi Arabia where they both procured B-1/B-2 [[Visa (document)|Visa]]s (tourist/business) on [[October 28]]th - but al-Hamlan then decided not to proceed and is thought to have returned to his family.  al-Nami's Visa application has since been reviewed, and while he mentions that Mushabib will be travelling with him, he listed his occupation as ''student'' but failed to provide an address for his school, and listed his intended address in the United States merely as [[Los Angeles]] - in the end he never used this Visa to enter the United States, and 'lost' his current [[passport]] (C115007) which showed evidence of travel to [[Afghanistan]], and procured a new one from [[Jeddah]] (C505363).  He used the new passport to acquire a new Visa on [[April 23]]rd, again recopying his answers from previously although crossing out the lines regarding Mushabib and previous attempts to acquire a Visa.  He was interviewed by a consular officer about this application, but it was ultimately granted again to him. It has been noted since that the records only highlighted past failures to acquire a Visa, so the officer had no way of realising that al-Nami had successfully received an earlier Visa.

In mid-November, 2000, the 9/11 Commission believes that three of the future muscle hijackers, Wail al Shehri, Waleed al Shehri, and [[Ahmed al-Nami]], all of whom had obtained their U.S. visas in late October, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to [[Beirut]] and then onward to [[Iran]] where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. This probably followed their return to Saudi Arabia to get &quot;clean&quot; passports. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.  

While in the [[United Arab Emirates]], al-Nami purchased [[Traveler's cheque|traveler's cheques]] presumed to have been paid for by [[Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi]].  Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including [[Majed Moqed]], [[Saeed Alghamdi]], [[Hamza Alghamdi]], [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] and [[Wail Alshehri]].

[[Image:Ahmed-alNami.jpg|thumb|left|140px|al-Nami in Video]]In March of [[2001]], Ahmed al-Nami appeared in an [[Al Qaeda]]  farewell video showing 13 of the ''muscle hijackers'', 12 of whom were Saudi, before they left their training centre in [[Kandahar]]; while he does not speak, he is seen studying maps and flight manuals.

On [[May 28]], [[2001]], al-Nami arrived in the United States from [[Dubai]] with fellow-hijackers [[Mohand al-Shehri]] and [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]]. By early June, Al-Nami was living in apartment 1504 at the ''Delray Racquet Club condominiums'' with [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], another alleged hijacker, in [[Delray Beach, Florida]] - he [[telephone]]d his family in 'Asir shortly after arriving in the country.

He was one of 9 hijackers to open a [[SunTrust]] bank account with a cash deposit around June of 2001., and on [[June 29]]th received either a Florida State Identification Card or Drivers License.[http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Ch2.pdf] 

He may have been one of three hijackers that listed the Naval Air Station in [[Pensacola, Florida]] as their permanent address on drivers' licenses, though other sources claim he listed the Delray condominium.

==The Attack==
On September 5th, al-Nami and [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]] purchase tickets for a [[September 7]]th flight to [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]] at the ''Mile High Travel'' on Commercial Boulevard - paying cash for their tickets.  [[Ziad Jarrah]] and [[Ahmad al-Haznawi]] also purchase tickets for the same flight though from ''Passage Tours''.

On [[September 11]], al-Nawi arrived in Newark to board [[United Airlines Flight 93]]  along with [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Ahmad al-Haznawi]] and [[Ziad Jarrah]] - some reports suggest al-Haznawi is pulled aside for screening while others claim there is no record of whether any of the four were screened; the lack of [[CCTV]] cameras at the time has compounded the problem.  al-Haznawi and one of the other three checked bags, and they boarded the plane between 7:39am and 7:48am - al-Nami seated in First Class 3C, next to al-Ghamdi.

Due to the flight's routine delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings and were told to be on the alert, though within two minutes Jarrah had stormed the cockpit leaving the pilots dead or injured.

At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas - an oddity in Islam where the colour red is frowned upon for men to wear, but possibly signifying an allegiance to the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]].  The calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside - it is not known which hijacker this was.

Passengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes, and organized a brief assault to retake the cockpit - it is believed the hijackers crashed the plane into the [[Pennsylvania]] farmland rather than cede control of the plane. All aboard died.

'''Ahmed Ibrahim al-Haznawi''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: &amp;#1575;&amp;#1581;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1583; &amp;#1575;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1585;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1607;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1605; &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1581;&amp;#1586;&amp;#1606;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1610;) was named by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] as one of the [[Organizers of the September 11, 2001 attacks|hijackers]] of [[United Airlines flight 93]] as part of the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]]. 

==History==
Born October 11th 1980, Al-Haznawi was from the [[al Bahah province]] of [[Saudi Arabia]], an isolated and underdeveloped area, and shared the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]], and [[Ahmed al-Ghamdi]]. This group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant of the hijackers. Al-Haznawi left home in [[1999]], saying he was going to fight in [[Chechnya]] against the [[Russia]]ns. It is unknown whether he ever went to Chechnya or not. His family lost contact with him in late [[2000]].

From November 27 through December 27th, al-Haznawi is in [[Saudi Arabia]] for [[Ramadan]].  It is thought that during this trip, he may have initially told [[Saeed Alghamdi|Saeed]] and [[Hamza Alghamdi]] about the operation.

Some time late in 2000, al-Haznawi traveled to the [[United Arab Emirates]], where he purchased [[traveler's cheques]] presumed to have been paid for by [[Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi]].  Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including [[Majed Moqed]], [[Saeed Alghamdi]], [[Hamza Alghamdi]], [[Wail al-Shehri]] and [[Ahmed al-Nami]].

[[image:Alhaznawi_video_aljazeera.jpg|left|frame|Al-Haznawi appeared in an [[al-Qaida]] video, pledging to give his life to [[martyr]]dom.]]
Ahmed al-Haznawi appeared on a videotape from [[Al-Qaida]] that was aired on [[Al Jazeera]] on [[April 16]], [[2002]]. It is not known when the tape was made. In it, he talked about his plans to bring the &quot;bloodied message&quot; to America.

On [[June 8]], [[2001]], he arrived in [[Miami, Florida]] with fellow hijacker [[Wail al-Shehri]].  He was one of 9 hijackers to open a [[SunTrust]] bank account with a cash deposit around June of 2001, and on [[July 10]]th obtained a Florida driver's license, later obtaining another copy on [[September 7]] by filling out a change-of-address form. Five other suspected hijackers also receive duplicate Florida licenses in 2001, and others had licenses in different states. Some have speculated that this was to allow multiple persons to use the same identity.[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-worldtrade-suspectprofiles.story]

==The Attack==
On [[September 11]], al-Haznawi boarded flight 93, and although he was selected for additional security and screened, he was able to board the flight without incident. Due to the flight's delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings that day and were told to be on the alert. Within minutes, Flight 93 was hijacked as well.

At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas - an oddity in Islam where the colour red is frowned upon for men to wear, but possibly signifying an allegiance to the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]].  The calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside - it is not known which hijacker this was.

Passengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes. A passenger uprising resulted in the plane crashing into [[Pennsylvania]], killing everyone aboard.

After the attacks, al-Haznawi's brother Ahmad Ibrahim told the [[Arab News]] that the photograph being published bore no resemblance to his brother[http://web.archive.org/web/20030616131506/http://arabview.com/article.asp?artID=98]

==Trivia==
Al-Haznawi once sought treatment at Holy Cross Hospital in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] for a &quot;skin [[lesion]]&quot;. Some allege that this was caused by cutaneous [[anthrax]], which would show, according to them, that those responsible for  the September 11 attacks also committed the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]. But an FBI spokesman said &quot;Exhaustive testing did not support that anthrax was present anywhere the hijackers had been,&quot; and &quot;nothing new has in fact developed.&quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/03/23/anthrax/?related][http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,673048,00.html]

{{Linguistic typology topics}}
An '''agglutinative language''' is a [[language]] in which the [[word]]s are formed by joining [[morpheme]]s together. This term was introduced by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] in [[1836]] to classify languages from a [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] point of view. It was derived from the [[Latin]] verb ''agglutinare'', which means &quot;to glue together.&quot;

An agglutinative language is a form of [[synthetic language]] where each [[affix]] typically represents one unit of meaning (such as &quot;diminutive&quot;, &quot;past tense&quot;, &quot;plural&quot;, etc.), and bound morphemes are expressed by affixes (and not by internal changes of the root of the word, or changes in stress or tone). Besides, and most importantly, in an agglutinative language affixes do not become fused with others, and do not change form conditioned by others. 

Synthetic languages which are not agglutinative are called [[fusional language]]s; they sometimes combine affixes by &quot;squeezing&quot; them together, often changing them drastically in the process, and joining several meanings in one affix (for example, in the Spanish word '''comí''' ''I ate'', the suffix -'''í''' carries the meanings of indicative [[grammatical mood|mood]], past [[grammatical tense|tense]], first person singular [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and perfect [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]).

''Agglutinative'' is sometimes used as a synonym for [[synthetic language|synthetic]], although it technically is not. When used in this way, the word embraces [[fusional language]]s and [[inflected language]]s in general. The distinction between an agglutinative and a fusional language is often not sharp. Rather, one should think of these as two ends of a continuum, with various languages falling more toward one end or the other. In fact, a synthetic language may present agglutinative features in its open lexicon but not in its case system: for example, [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

Agglutinative languages tend to have a high rate of affixes/morphemes per word, and to be very regular. For example, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has only three irregular verbs (and not ''very'' irregular), [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] only two. [[Georgian language|Georgian]] is an exception; not only is it highly agglutinative (there can be simultaneously up to 8 morphemes per word), but there are also significant number of irregular verbs, varying in degrees of irregularity.

==Examples of agglutinative languages==
Examples of agglutinative languages are the [[Altaic languages]] (see [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), [[Basque language|Basque]], the [[Dravidian languages]], the [[Uralic languages]], [[Inuktitut]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Malay language|Malay]], the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast]], [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest]] and [[South Caucasian languages|South Caucasian]] languages, and some [[Mesoamerican languages|Mesoamerican]] and native North American languages including [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], [[Huastec#Huastec language|Huastec]], and [[Salishan languages|Salish]]. In the past, most of the [[Ancient Near East]] and what is now [[Iran]] also spoke such languages, like [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], [[Urartian language|Urartian]], [[Hattic language|Hattic]], [[Gutian]], [[Lullubi]], [[Punjabi]] and [[Kassites#Kassite language|Kassite]]. An example of an agglutinative [[constructed language]] is [[Klingon (language)|Klingon]].

Agglutinative languages are not entirely grouped by the family (although [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are definitely related, as are, it is often posited, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]). It is possible that [[convergent evolution]] had many separate languages develop this property, but there seems to exist a preferred evolutionary direction from agglutinative synthetic languages to fusional synthetic languages, and then to non-synthetic languages, which in their turn evolve again into agglutinative synthetic languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Athanasius of Alexandria''' (also spelled &quot;Athanasios&quot;) ([[298]]&amp;ndash;[[May 2]], [[373]]) was a [[Christianity|Christian]] bishop, the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], in the fourth century. He is revered as a [[saint]] by both the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and regarded as a great leader and doctor of the Church by [[Protestantism|Protestants]].  Roman Catholics have declared him one of 33 [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]]. His feast day is [[January 18]].


==Historical significance==
===Opposition to Arianism===
[[Image:Stathanasius.jpg|thumb|[[Copt|Coptic]] Icon of St Athanasius]] In about [[319]], when Athanasius was a [[deacon]], a [[presbyter]] named [[Arius]] began teaching that there was a time before [[God]] the Father begat [[Jesus]] when the latter did not exist. Athanasius accompanied [[Alexander of Alexandria|Alexander]] to the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in [[325]], which council produced the [[Nicene Creed]] and anathematized Arius and his followers. On [[May 9]], [[328]], he succeeded [[Alexander of Alexandria|Alexander]] as bishop of [[Alexandria]]. As a result of rises and falls in Arianism's influence, he was banished from Alexandria only to be later restored on at least five separate occasions, perhaps as many as seven. This gave rise to the expression &quot;Athanasius contra mundum&quot; or &quot;Athanasius against the world&quot;. During some of his exiles, he spent time with the [[Desert Father]]s, monks and hermits who lived in remote areas of Egypt. Despite his doctrinal firmness, he showed diplomatic flair in rallying the Orthodox at the Council of Alexandria in 362.

===Writings===
Possibly during his first exile at Trier in 335-7, although probably between 318 and 323, Athanasius wrote a double treatise entitled ''Against the Gentiles -- On the Incarnation'', affirming and explaining that [[Jesus]] was both God and Man. In his major theological opus, the ''Three Discourses Against the Arians'', Athanasius stressed that the Father's begetting of the Son, or uttering of the Word, was an eternal relationship between them, not an event that took place within time. He makes very sparing use of the key-word of Nicea, [[ousios|homoousios]] (consubstantial). These writings lay the foundation of catholic [[Christianity]]'s fight against the [[heresy]] of [[Arianism]], which Athanasius opposed all his life. He also wrote a defence of the divinity of the [[Holy Spirit]] (''Letters to Serapion'') in the 360s, and wrote a polemic (''On the Holy Spirit'') against the [[Macedonians (religious group)|Macedonian heresy]].

Athanasius also wrote a biography of [[Anthony the Great]] entitled ''Vita Antonii'', or ''Life of Antony'', that later served as an inspiration to Christian [[monasticism|monastics]] in both the East and the West. The [[Athanasian Creed]] is traditionally ascribed to him.

===New Testament canon===
Athanasius is also the first person to identify the same 27 books of the [[New Testament]] that are in use today.  Up until then, various similar lists of works to be read in churches were in use. A milestone in the evolution of the [[Biblical canon|canon of New Testament books]] is his Easter letter from Alexandria, written in [[367]], usually referred to as his ''39th Festal Letter''.  [[Pope Damasus]], the [[Bishop of Rome]] in [[382]], promulgated a list of books which contained a New Testament canon identical to that of Athanasius.  A synod in [[Hippone]] in [[393]] repeated Athansius' and Damasus' New Testament list (without the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]), and a synod in [[Carthage]] in [[397]] repeated Athanasius' and Damasus' complete New Testament list.

Scholars have debated whether Athanasius' list in 367 was the basis for the later lists.  Because Athanasius' canon is the closest canon of any of the Church Fathers to the canon used by Protestant churches today many Protestants point to Athanasius as the father of the canon. They are identical except that Athanasius excludes the [[Book of Esther]] which is placed in a [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanon]] along with the [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]], [[Ben Sira|Sirach (Ecclesiasticus)]], [[Book of Judith|Judith]], [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], the [[Didache]], and the [[The Shepherd of Hermas|Shepherd of Hermas]]. On the other hand, Catholics tend to point to Damasus or the Council of Carthage, since these councils endorsed an Old Testament identical to that used by Catholics today.  Regardless of this question, the New Testament canon endorsed by Athanasius has been used by almost all Christians since his day.

===Relics and veneration===
[[Image:StAthanasiusShrineinStMarkCathedralCairo.jpg|thumb|St. Athanasius Shrine (where the saint's relics are preserved) under St. Mark's Cathedral, Cairo]] The saint was originally buried in Alexandria. His holy body was later transferred to Italy. H.H. [[Pope]] [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Shenouda III]] restored the relics of St. Athanasius back to Egypt on 15 May 1973 [http://www.avarewase.org/en/map/athanas.htm], after his historical visit to the Vatican and meeting with H.H. [[Pope Paul VI]]. The relics of St. Athanasius the Great of Alexandria are currently preserved under the new St. [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] [[Copt|Coptic]] Orthodox Cathedral in Deir El-Anba Rowais, Abbassiya, Cairo, Egypt.

The following is a [[troparion]] (hymn) to St. Athanasius sung in some Orthodox churches.
: ''O holy father Athanasius,'' 
: ''like a pillar of orthodoxy'' 
: ''you refuted the heretical nonsense of Arius''
: ''by insisting that the Father and the Son are equal in essence.''
: ''O venerable father, beg Christ our God to save our souls.''

==Criticism of Athanasius==
The tactics of Athanasius, while often downplayed by church historians, were a significant factor in his success. He did not hesitate to back up his theological views with the use of force. In Alexandria, he assembled an &quot;ecclesiastical mafia&quot; that could instigate a riot in the city if needed.  It was an arrangement &quot;built up and perpetuated by violence.&quot; (Barnes, 230). Along with the standard method of excommunication he used beatings, intimidation, kidnapping and imprisonment to silence his  theological opponents. Unsurprisingly, these tactics caused widespread distrust and led him to being tried many times for &quot;bribery, theft, extortion, [[sacrilege]], treason and murder. (Rubenstein, 6) While the charges rarely stuck, his reputation was a major factor in his multiple exiles from Alexandria.

He justified these tactics with the argument that he was saving all future Christians from hell. Athanasius stubbornly refused to compromise his theological views by stating, &quot;What is at stake is not just a theological theory but people's salvation.&quot;  (Olson, 172).  In this assertion that violence was justified in defense of theology and the church, Athanasius, some hold, laid the foundation for theological concepts such as [[just war]] and [[inquisition|the inquisition]]. He played a clear role in making [[constantinian shift]] a part of the theology of the church.

The '''Azores''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: '''''Açores''''', [[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /{{IPA|ɐ.'so.ɾɨʃ}}/ or /{{IPA|ɐ.'so.ɾʃ}}/) are an [[archipelago]] of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[island]]s in the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], about 1,500 km from [[Lisbon]] and about 3,900 km from the east coast of [[North America]].

The nine Azorean Islands extend for more than 600 km, and lie in a northwest-southeast direction. The vast extension of the islands defines an immense [[Exclusive Economic Zone|exclusive economic zone]] of 1.1 million km². The westernmost point of this area is 3,380 km from the North American continent. All of the islands have volcanic origins, though Santa Maria also has some reef contribution. The mountain of Pico on [[Pico Island]], at 2,351 m in altitude, is the highest in all of Portugal.  The Azores are actually the tops of some of the tallest mountains on the planet, as measured from their base at the bottom of the ocean. The islands are an [[autonomous region]] of [[Portugal]]. 

Though it is commonly said that the archipelago is named after the [[goshawk]] (''Açor'' in Portuguese), because it was supposed to be a common bird at the time of the discovery, it actually never existed on the islands. Some historians indicate the archaic Portuguese word &quot;azures&quot; (the plural of blue) because of the colour of the islands when seen from afar. Most, however, insist that the name is derived from birds, pointing to a local subspecies of the [[common buzzard|buzzard]] (''Buteo buteo''), as the animal the first explorers erroneously identified as goshawks.

== History ==
[[image:Azores old map.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Old map of Azores Islands]]
In [[1427]], one of the captains sailing for [[Henry the Navigator]] discovered the Azores, p'''ossibl'''y [[Gonçalo Velho]], but this is not certain. The [[colonization]] of the then-unoccupied islands started in [[1439]] with people mainly from the continental provinces of [[Algarve]] and [[Alentejo]]; in the following centuries settlers from other European countries arrived, most notably from Northern [[France]] and the [[Flanders]]. In [[1583]], [[Philip II of Spain]] as king of Portugal, sent his combined Iberian fleet to clear the French traders from the Azores, decisively hanging his [[prisoners-of-war]] from the yardarms and contributing to the &quot;[[Black Legend]]&quot;. The Azores were the second-to-last part of the Portuguese empire to resist Philip's reign over Portugal ([[Macau]] being the last).

The [[1820]] civil war, in Portugal, had strong repercussion in the Azores. In [[1829]], in [[Vila da Praia]], the [[liberalism|liberal]]s won over the [[Political absolutism|absolutists]], making [[Terceira Island]] the main headquarters of the new Portuguese regime and also where the Council of Regency (''Conselho de Regência'') of [[Mary II of Portugal]] was established.

Beginning in [[1868]], [[Portugal]] issued its stamps overprinted with &quot;AÇORES&quot; for use in the islands. Between [[1892]] and [[1906]], it also issued separate stamps for the three administrative districts of the time.

From [[1938]] to [[1978]], the archipelago was divided into three districts, quite equivalent (except in area) to those in the Portuguese mainland. The division was quite arbitrary, and didn’t follow the natural island groups, rather reflecting the location of each district capital on the three main cities (neither of each on the western group).

'''Angra''' consisted of Terceira, São Jorge, and Graciosa, with the capital at [[Angra do Heroísmo]] on Terceira.

'''Horta''' consisted of Pico, Faial, Flores, and Corvo, with the capital at [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] on Faial.

'''Ponta Delgada''' consisted of São Miguel and Santa Maria, with the capital at [[Ponta Delgada]] on São Miguel.

In [[1976]] the Azores became an Autonomous Region (Região Autónoma dos Açores) and the Azorean districts were suppressed.

== Politics ==
Since becoming a Portuguese Autonomous Region, the executive section of the local authority has been located in Ponta Delgada, the legislative in Horta and the judicial in Angra do Heroísmo. The President of the Regional Government is [[Carlos César]].  The Azores is considered to have one of the most uncorrupt government bodies in the world today.

== Municipalities  ==
[[Image:Pasture fields in The Azores.jpg|thumb|Pasture fields in The Azores]]
The Azores are divided into 19 municipalities (''concelhos''); each municipality is further divided into parishes (''freguesias''). The Azores have a total of 156 parishes.

There are also 5 cities: [[Ponta Delgada]] and [[Ribeira Grande]] on São Miguel Island; [[Angra do Heroísmo]] and [[Praia da Vitória]] on Terceira, and [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] on Faial.

The [[archipelago]] is spread out in the area of the [[Circle of latitude|parallel]] that passes through Lisbon (39º, 43'/39º, 55' North Latitude), giving it a moderate climate, with mild annual oscillation. The Azores lie in the [[Palearctic ecozone]], forming a unique [[biome]] among the world's [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]], with many [[endemic species]] of plants. The nine islands have a total area of 2,355 km². Their individual areas vary between 759 km² ([[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]]) and 17 [[square kilometre|km²]] ([[Corvo Island|Corvo]]). Three islands (São Miguel, Pico and Terceira) are bigger in size than [[Malta]] (composed of three different islands), São Miguel Island alone being twice as big.

The nine islands are divided into three groups:
* The Eastern Group (''Grupo Oriental'') of [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]], [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]] and [[Formigas Islets]]
* The Central Group (''Grupo Central'') of [[Terceira Island|Terceira]], [[Graciosa Island|Graciosa]], [[São Jorge]], [[Pico Island|Pico]] and [[Faial]]
* The Western Group (''Grupo Ocidental'') of [[Flores Island, Portugal|Flores]] and [[Corvo Island|Corvo]].

The islands were formed during the [[Tertiary]] period, in the Alpine phase. Their volcanic cones and craters reveal the volcanic origin of most islands. [[Pico Island|Pico]], a volcano that stands 2,351 metres high on the island of the same name, has the highest altitude in the Azores. The last volcano to erupt was the Capelinhos Volcano (''Vulcão dos Capelinhos'') in [[1957]], in western part of Faial island, increasing the size of that island. Santa Maria Island is the oldest Azorean island presenting several limestone and red clay extensions.

The Azores had a population of 238,767 in [[31 December]] [[2002]] and a population density of 106 persons/[[square kilometre|km²]].

[[image:Yalgoo Shire.jpg|thumb|right|350px|a [[Tourism|tourism]] sign post [[Yalgoo, Western Australia]]]]
The '''outback''' is the remote and usually semi-arid interior of [[Australia]], although the term colloquially can cover any lands outside of the main urban areas. The term outback is generally used to refer to locations that are comparatively more remote than those areas deemed &quot;[[The Bush|the bush]]&quot;. The outback does not officially exist within any governmental frameworks or boundaries.  Many local government shires do use the term to enhance tourist appeal for their own shire. 

The marginally fertile parts are known as [[Rangeland]]s and have been traditionally used for [[domestic sheep|sheep]] or [[cattle]] farming, on [[sheep station]]s and [[cattle station]]s on [[pastoral lease]]s.  

Along with agriculture, [[tourism]] and scattered [[mining]] are the main economic activities in this vast and sparsely settled area. Due to the size of the outback, the total value of mining and farming is considerable.

== Population ==
[[Image:Rural Australia Abandoned habitat.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An abandoned settlement in the outback]]

Over 90% of the Australian population lives in urban settlements on the coastal fringes. Despite this, the outback and the history of its [[exploration]] and settlement provides Australians with a mythical backdrop, and stories of [[swagman|swagmen]], [[squatter]]s, outlaws such as [[Ned Kelly]] (though Ned Kelly spent virtually all his time in the relatively temperate [[Great Dividing Range]]) and so on are central to the national ethos of the country. The song [[Waltzing Matilda]], which is about swagmen and squatters, is a popular traditional Australian song.

There have been various attempts at creating settlements for [[Australian Aboriginals]] to live traditionally, with varied success. Often after becoming used to European influences and generational changes it is difficult for Aboriginals to live this kind of lifestyle.

==Medicine In The Outback==
Due to the wide expanses and remoteness of people when in the outback; a unique service by the name of [[Royal_Flying_Doctor_Service_of_Australia|The Flying Doctors]] was created.  This service was created in [[1928]] in [[Cloncurry, Queensland]].  The aim of the service is to provide medical care, primary and emergency, to people who cannot reach a [[hospitals]] or [[general practitioner]]s.  Consultations are carried out via radio or telephone and for serious situations, doctors are flown out to patients.

==Terminology==
Culturally, many urban Australians have had very generalised terms for the otherwise complex range of environments that exist within the inland sections of the continent. Regional terminology can be very specific to specific locations in each mainland state. Western Australians have for instance 'the goldfields' which usually designate [[Kalgoorlie]] and beyond.
 
&quot;The Never-Never&quot; is a term referring to remoter parts of the Australian outback. The outback can be also referred to as &quot;back of beyond&quot;,  &quot;back o' Bourke&quot; or &quot;way out past Bumblefuck&quot;, although these terms are more frequently used when referring to something a long way from anywhere, or a long way away.

==Tourism==

[[Image:Outback.jpg|thumb|right|Flying over western [[New South Wales]]. Near the bottom of the picture, a squiggly line appears; apparently, a [[creek]] created by recent [[rain]].]]
There are many popular tourist attractions in the outback. These include:

*[[Alice Springs]]
*[[Uluru|Uluru (Ayers Rock)]]
*[[Coober Pedy]]
*[[Devils Marbles]]
*[[Katherine River|Katherine River Gorge]]
*[[Kings Canyon, Northern Territory|Kings Canyon (Watarrka)]]
*[[Kata Tjuta|The Olgas (Kata Tjuta)]]
*[[MacDonnell Ranges]]
*[[Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame]]
*[[Monkey Mia]]
*[[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]]
*[[Mount Augustus National Park]]

Organised travel to the outback is popular, although some Australian and international tourists travel in their own vehicles. Such a trip, particularly once off the few bitumen roads in the outback, requires considerable advance planning and a suitable vehicle (usually a [[four wheel drive]]). On remote routes considerable supplies and equipment may be required, this can included prearranged caches. Some trips cannot be undertaken safely with a single vehicle instead requiring a convoy approach. Deaths from tourists and locals becoming stranded on outback trips occur, and rescues for the ill-prepared are a regular occurrence.

==Historic==
The outback is also criss-crossed by numerous historic tracks, roads and highways, including:
[[Image:Gibb River Rd-1.jpg|right|500px]]
* [[Birdsville Track]]
* [[Burke Developmental Road]]
* [[Canning Stock Route]]
* [[Colson Track]]
* [[Connie Sue Highway]]

* [[Gary Highway]]
* [[Gibb River Road]]
* [[Gunbarrel Highway]]
* [[K1 Line]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Absolute Infinite''' is  [[Georg Cantor]]'s concept of an &quot;[[infinity]]&quot; that transcended the [[transfinite number]]s.  Cantor equated the Absolute Infinite with [[God]].  He held that the [[The Absolute|Absolute]] [[Infinite]] had various [[mathematical]] properties, including that every property of the Absolute Infinite is also held by some smaller object.

== Cantor's view ==

Cantor is quoted as saying:

:The actual infinite arises in three contexts: first when it is realized in the most complete form, in a fully independent otherworldly being, ''in Deo'', where I call it the Absolute Infinite or simply Absolute; second when it occurs in the contingent, created world; third when the mind grasps it ''in abstracto'' as a mathematical magnitude, number or order type. [2]

Cantor also mentioned the idea in his famous letter to [[Richard Dedekind]] [[28 July]] [[1899]] [[#Endnotes|&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;]]:

:A [[multiplicity]] is called [[well-ordered]] if it fulfills the condition that every sub-multiplicity has a first [[element (mathematics)|element]]; such a multiplicity I call for short a sequence. Now I envisage the system of all numbers and denote it ''&amp;Omega;''. The system ''&amp;Omega;'' in its natural ordering according to magnitude is a &quot;sequence&quot;. Now let us adjoin 0 as an additional element to this sequence, and certainly if we set this 0 in the first position then ''&amp;Omega;''* is still a sequence ... of which one can readily convince oneself that every number occurring in it is the [ordinal number] of the sequence of all its preceding elements. Now ''&amp;Omega;''* (and therefore also ''&amp;Omega;'') cannot be a consistent multiplicity. For if ''&amp;Omega;''* were consistent, then as a well-ordered set, a number ''&amp;Delta;'' would belong to it which would be greater than all numbers of the system ''&amp;Omega;''; the number ''&amp;Delta;'', however, also belongs to the system ''&amp;Omega;'', because it comprises all numbers. Thus ''&amp;Delta;'' would be greater than ''&amp;Delta;'', which is a contradiction. Thus the system ''&amp;Omega;'' of all ordinal numbers is an inconsistent, '''absolutely infinite''' multiplicity.&quot;

== The Burali-Forti paradox ==

The idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist, seems [[paradoxical]] to many. This is related to [[Burali-Forti paradox |Cesare Burali-Forti's &quot;paradox&quot;]] that there can be no greatest [[ordinal number]]. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.

More generally, as noted by [[A.W. Moore]], there can be no end to the process of [[set (mathematics)|set]] formation, and thus no such thing as the ''totality of all sets'', or the ''set hierarchy''.  Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the [[hierarchy]] and thus failing to contain every set.

A standard solution to this problem is found in [[Zermelo set theory|Zermelo's set theory]], which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property ''and lie in some given set'' (Zermelo's [[Axiom schema of specification|Axiom of Separation]]). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.

However, while this neatly solves the logical problem, the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed in a naïve sense, [[set theory]] might be said to be based on this notion. Zermelo's fix would seem to commit us to the rather mysterious notion of a ''[[proper class]]'': a class of objects that does not have any formal existence, as an object (set), within our theory. For example, the class of all sets would be such a proper class.

==Endnotes==
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; Ivor Grattan-Guinness has shown that this &quot;letter&quot; is really an amalgam by Cantor's editor [[Ernst Zermelo]] of several letters written at different times (I. Grattan-Guinness, &quot;The rediscovery of the Cantor-Dedekind Correspondence&quot;, ''Jahresbericht der deutschen Mathematik-Vereinigung'' 76, 104-139

      <text xml:space="preserve">[''noun phrase''] An '''acceptance test''' in [[engineering]] is a test that a user/sponsor and manufacturer/producer jointly perform on a finished, engineered [[product]]/[[system]] through [[black-box testing]] (i.e., the user or tester need not know anything about the internal workings of the system). It is often referred to as a(n) ''functional test'', ''[[beta test]]'', ''QA test'', ''application test'', ''confidence test,'' ''final test,'' or ''end user test''. It is also sometimes split into a ''factory acceptance test'' and/or a ''site or field acceptance test'', the former being run within the manufacturer's facilities, the latter at the user's site, within the user's environment.

[''verb phrase''] To test a manufactured, engineered system and, based on the results, either grant or not grant acceptance of the system by the sponsor/user from the manufacturer/producer.  

Acceptance tests generally take the form of a suite of tests designed to be run on the completed system. Each individual test exercises a particular operating condition of the user's environment, or a feature of the system, known as a case. And each test case has a [[boolean]] outcome: pass or fail. There is generally no degree of success or failure. The test environment is usually designed to be identical, or as close as possible, to the anticipated user's environment. These case tests must each be accompanied by test case input data and/or a formal description of the operational activities to be performed— intended to thoroughly exercise the specific case— and a formal description of the expected results. The acceptance test (suite) is run against the supplied input data and/or an actual environment using an acceptance test script to direct the testers, and the results obtained are compared with the expected results. If there is a correct match for every case, the test is said to pass. If not, the system may either be rejected or accepted on conditions previously agreed between the sponsor and the manufacturer.

The objective is to provide confidence that the delivered system meets the business requirements of the sponsors and users. The acceptance phase may also act as the final quality gateway, where any quality defects not previously detected may be uncovered.

A principal purpose of the acceptance test is that, once completed successfully, and provided certain additional (contractually agreed) acceptance criteria are met, the sponsors will then sign off on the system as satisfying the contract (previously agreed between sponsor and manufacturer), and deliver final payment.

== The coinage == 

The '''Archbishops of Riga'''  were innovators in the field of minting currency, reviving techniques abandoned since the collapse of [[Rome]]. The names of individual archbishops after 1418, as well as the years of their respective reigns, are stamped on Livonian [[penny|pennies]] excavated at archaeological sites; in many cases, this is the only biographical data available. No Livonian pennies before 1418 have been found.

'''Ansbach''', or '''Anspach''', originally '''Onolzbach''', is a town in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It is the capital of the [[Regierungsbezirk|administrative region]] of [[Mittelfranken|Middle Franconia]]. Ansbach is situated 25 miles southwest of [[Nuremberg]] and 90 miles north of [[Munich]], on the [[Fränkische Rezat]], a tributary of the [[Main]] river. Population: 40.723 (2004).

The city has five schools.  It is connected by motorway [[Bundesautobahn 6|A6]] and routes [[German route 13|13]] and [[German route 14|14]].

==History==
A Benedictine monastery at the place was founded around [[748]] by a [[Franconia]]n noble, [[Gumbertus]], who was later canonized. In the following centuries the monastery and the adjoining village (''Onoldsbach'') grew to become the town of Ansbach (called a town in [[1221]] for the first time).

The counts of [[Oettingen]] ruled over Ansbach until the [[Hohenzollern]] burgraves of Nuremberg took over in [[1331]]. The Hohenzollerns made Ansbach the seat of their dynasty until their acquisition of the [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of [[Brandenburg]] in [[1415]]. However, after the death of [[Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg]] in [[1440]] the Franconian cadet branch of the family was not politically united with the main Brandenburg line, remaining independent as &quot;Brandenburg-Ansbach.&quot; 

Margrave [[Georg, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|George the Pious]] introduced the [[Protestant Reformation]] to Ansbach in [[1528]], leading to the secularization of St. Gumbertus Abbey in [[1563]].

In [[1792]] Ansbach was annexed by the Hohenzollerns of [[Prussia]]. In 1796  the Duke of Zweibrücken, [[Maximilian I of Bavaria|Maximilian Joseph]], the posterior Bavarian king Max I. Joseph was exiled to Asnbach after Zweibrücken had been taken by the French. In Ansbach [[Maximilian von Montgelas]] wrote an elaborate concept for the future political organisation of Bavaria, which is known as the &quot;[http://www.hdbg.de/montgelas/pages/hmv33.htm Ansbacher Mémoire]&quot;. In [[1806]] [[Prussia]] ceded Ansbach and the principality of Ansbach to Bavaria in exchange for the Bavarian [[Berg (German region)|duchy of Berg]].

At the end of the [[17th century]], the margraves' palace at Ansbach was rebuilt in [[Baroque]] style. 

Since [[1970]], Ansbach has enlarged its municipal area by incorporating adjacent communities.

Ansbach was a small town largely by-passed by the [[Industrial Revolution]], an administrative and cultural center. Although all bridges were destroyed, the historical center of Ansbach was spared during [[World War II]] and it has kept its baroque character. 

Ansbach hosts several units of the U.S. armed forces, associated with German units under [[NATO]]. There are three separate U.S. installations: Shipton Kaserne, home to 6th Bn., 52nd Air Defense Artillery; Katterbach Kaserne, where the 1st Division's 4th Combat Aviation Brigade resides, associated with Bismarck Kaserne, where the post exchange, etc. are located, and Barton Barracks, home to the 235th BSB.

'''National Alliance''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Alleanza Nazionale'', often shortened to ''AN'') is a right-wing [[Italy|Italian]] political party. It was formed by current secretary [[Gianfranco Fini]] from the [[Italian Social Movement]] (''MSI''), which was declared dissolved in January [[1995]], and conservative elements of the former [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], which had disbanded in [[1994]] after two years of scandals and various splits due to [[Political corruption|corruption]] at its hightest levels, exposed by the [[Mani Pulite]] investigation. Former MSI members were however still the bulk of the new party.

The [[logo]] follows a template very similar to the [[Democratic Party of the Left]], with the previous logo in a small circle (as a means of legally preventing others from using it). The name was suggested by an article on the Italian newspaper ''Il Tempo'' written in 1992 by [[Domenico Fisichella]], and echoes the name of the left-wing [[Democratic Alliance (Italy)|Democratic Alliance]], a contemporary short-lived project of a lay centre-left coalition whose founder was [[Ferdinando Adornato]].

Its electorate is mainly in the central-southern regions, but it also competes in the north-east with the [[Lega Nord]], its ally in the ruling right center coalition [[Casa delle Libertà]]. The relationship of AN with the Northern League can be tense at times, especially about issues of national unity, but the two parties share views on other issues such as [[immigration]]; AN's view is normally more moderate than Lega Nord's.

==Political program==
AN's political program emphasizes:
* [[Catholicism]], close to the official [[Church]] position, also due to the participation of the former members of the Christian Democracy;
* [[law and order (politics)|law and order]], especially laws aimed at controlling [[immigration]] and promoting national cohesion, also due to the partitipation of the members of the former MSI.

Distinguishing itself from the MSI, AN has used the expression &quot;post-Fascist&quot; to characterise itself, and proclaims its commitment to [[constitutionalism]], [[democracy]] and [[political pluralism]]. However, while the uncontested leader Gianfranco Fini has been steering mostly clear of strong association to the fascist pasts, many high-ranking members (often dubbed ''colonels''), such as [[Ignazio La Russa]], have been caught in statements defending the combatants of the [[Repubblica Sociale Italiana]], the German [[puppet state]] in northern Italy during [[World War II]]. Some proposals have been laid out by members of AN to make the status of RSI [[veteran]]s equal to that of [[Italian resistance movement|partisan]]s, thus equating freedom fighters and Mussolini-loyalist fascist soldiers.

Alleanza Nazionale has distanced itself from [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Fascism|fascism]] and made efforts to improve relations with [[Jew]]ish groups. With most hardliners leaving the party, it seeks to present itself as a respectable [[rightwing]] party.

Nearly two-thirds of the party's supporters approve of the [[capitalist]] system and hold favourable views on the [[privatisation]] of [[state industries]].

==History==
In January 1995, as officially Gianfranco Fini proclaimed MSI's dissolution, and the foundation of the AN, he announced the abandonment MSI's ideological stances, symbols, gestures and salutes that had closely identified it with the Mussolinian past.

Despite Fini's success in distancing the party's image from the former MSI, including the suppression of anti-Jewish comments in public and the party organ &quot;Il Secolo d'Italia&quot;, there remain contradictions within the party, mainly in regard to its fascist past.

A rare anti-Semitic manifestation was a March 1999 leaflet produced by the AN's [[Julius Evola]] Club in [[Sestu]] ([[Cagliari]]). The leaflet quoted alleged [[Talmud]]ic passages as proof that Jews compared [[gentile]]s to beasts. In response to protests, the local AN president claimed that the references were intended to be &quot;neither racist, nor anti-democratic nor anti-Jewish&quot;.

The AN club in [[Fiumicino]] (close to [[Rome]]), called for a square to be named after fascist leader [[Ettore Muti]], while the president of the region of [[Latium]], [[Francesco Storace]], asked that each city dedicate a street to [[Giorgio Almirante]], the predecessor of Fini as the leader of the now-defunct MSI, and a [[criminal of war]] during [[World War II]].

When Gianfranco Fini visited [[Israel]] in late November [[2003]] in the function of Italian deputy prime minister, he labeled the [[racial law]]s issued by the fascist regime in [[1938]] as &quot;infamous&quot;. He also referred to the RSI as belonging to the most shameful pages of the past, and considered fascism part of an era of &quot;absolute evil&quot;.

As a result, [[Alessandra Mussolini]], the granddaughter of the former fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], and some hardliners left the party; she stated that &quot;absolute evil&quot; for her was piazzale Loreto, the square in [[Milan]] where her grandfather's remains were shown to the public in the final days of World War II.

==Government participation==
The party has taken part in the first three [[House of Freedoms]] coalition governments ([[1994]] and from [[2001]]) of prime minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], in the second and third of which Fini is deputy prime minister and, from November [[2004]], [[foreign minister]].

==Electoral Results==
In [[1998]], it had a membership of 485,657 in 11,539 branches, 89 deputies and 41 senators in the [[Italian Parliament]] and nine members of the [[European Parliament]].

The AN suffered a 5 % loss in the [[1999]] elections to the European Parliament, obtaining only 10.3 % of the vote. It recovered somewhat in the April regional elections, gaining 12.8 % nationwide, and well over 20 % in Rome and Latium.

In the May [[2001]] national elections AN obtained 96 seats out of 630 in the Chamber of Deputies and 46 seats out of 324 in the Senate. The party lost a few key seats in the [[2003]] local elections such as the Province of Rome, but its position remained firm. The party obtained 11.5 % of the vote and 9 seats in the June [[2004]] European Parliament elections. In the [[2005]] regional elections AN lost almost all the remaining key seats, such as the Region of Lazio.

In the [[European Parliament]], its [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s work within the group of the [[Union for a Europe of Nations]].

==July 2005 purge==
In July [[2005]], three of Fini's &quot;colonels&quot; ([[Altero Matteoli]], [[Ignazio La Russa]] and [[Maurizio Gasparri]]), among the most powerful politicians in the party, were overheard in a café close to the [[Italian Parliament]] by an [[intern]] of the [[newspaper]] [[Il Tempo]]. [http://www.iltempo.it/approfondimenti/index.aspx?id=731449] They were recorded making unflattering comments about Fini's health, political capacity and unfitness to run the upcoming political campaign for the [[2006]] national elections.

As the news was made public, the three tried to apologize, but an allegedly furious Fini fired all of them on [[July 18]], and assumed complete control of the party. He proceeded to reengineer the party's structure, and assigned the new posts.

In the [[congress]] that had been held a few weeks before these events, Fini had criticised [[factionalism]] in the party, and received explicit criticism for that&amp;mdash;possibly for the first time so explicitly in a party that has a long tradition of obedience to its leader.

[[Image:Arno_river.jpg|thumbnail||300px|Arno River in Florence, Italy]]
The '''Arno''' is a [[river]] in the [[Tuscany]] region of [[Italy]], 

The river rises on [[Mount Falterona]] (1654 m) in the in the [[Casentino]] area) of the [[Apennines]], and takes a southward curve. The river turns to the west near [[Arezzo]] passing through [[Florence]], [[Empoli]] and [[Pisa, Italy|Pisa]], flowing into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] at [[Marina di Pisa]].  With a length of 241 km, it is the largest river in the region. Its tributaries are : the Sieve (60 km), Bisenzio (49 km), Era, Elsa and Pesa.

It crosses [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], where it passes below the [[Ponte Vecchio]] and the Santa Trinita bridge (built by [[Bartolomeo Ammannati]], but inspired by [[Michelangelo]]). The river [[flood]]ed this city regularly in historical times, the last occasion being the famous flood of [[1966]], with 4,500 [[cubic metre|m³]]/[[second|s]] after a rain of 437.2 [[millimetre|mm]] in Badia Agnano and 190 mm in Florence, in only 24 [[hour]]s.

[[Image:Firenze.Arno.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;small&gt;Banks of the Arno, seen from Santa Trinita bridge, Florence&lt;/small&gt;]]
The flow rate of the Arno is irregular. It is sometimes described as having a torrent-like behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near-flood in a few days. At the point where the Arno leaves the Appennines, flow measurements can vary between 0.56 m³/s and 3,540 m³/s. New [[dam]]s built upstream of Florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years.

==City's Information==

The seat of the municipality is the city of Aveiro, with about 50,000 inhabitants in the 5 urban parishes. Located on the shore of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], Aveiro is an industrial city with an important [[seaport]]. The city of Aveiro is also the Capital of the District of [[Aveiro_(district)|Aveiro]].

Aveiro is known in Portugal for its traditional sweets, the [[ovos-moles]] and the [[trouxas de ovos]], both made from eggs. It is sometimes called &quot;The Portuguese [[Venice]]&quot; because of its canals and boats that remind one of the Italian city of Venice. As the city faced similar problems when it tried to conquer the water.

The city dates back at least to the 10th century when it was known by it's first Latin name of Aviarium, literally, &quot;a gathering place or preserve of birds&quot;. The Moors invaded and then held it until the 14th century, after which it became popular with Portuguese royalty. In the winter of 1575, a terrible storm closed the entrance to its port, ending a thriving trade in metals and tiles. The same storm also created a reef barrier at the Atlantic Ocean.

The city is also famous for its production of salt and for its seaweed harvest which is used for fertilizer in the area. 

João Alfonso, one of the discoverers of the Newfoundland fisheries, was born there. 

The city is also famous for the Convento de Jesus (now known as the city museum), built in the 15th century, which contains the tomb of the daughter of Alfonso V, St. Joana, who died in 1490. The presence of this royal personage, beatified in 1673, proved to be of great benefit when she bequeathed her valuable estate to the convent. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the convent housed a school of embroidery, which produced many of the sumptuous pieces kept in the museum.

Aveiro hosted 3 games of the [[2004 European Football Championship]].

The [[Universidade de Aveiro|University of Aveiro]] was created in 1973 and is considered one of the most dynamic and innovative universities of Portugal, attracting thousands of students to the city.
The University has about 430 professors (with Ph.D. degree), 11,000 undergraduate students and 1,300 post-graduate students.
