Once all the various components had been installed on the Saturn V, it was moved to the launch site, Launch Complex 39A. During late June and early July 1971, the rocket and Mobile Service Structure were struck by [[lightning]] at least four times. All was well however, with only minor damage suffered.

:''The following is a brief overview of the ''Apollo 15'' mission. For more in-depth information, see each the main article for each section.''

===Outward journey===
{{Apollo15series}}
{{main|Apollo 15, Outward journey}}
Launching at 9:34:00 am EDT on [[July 26]], [[1971]], ''Apollo 15'' would take four days to reach the Moon. After spending two hours in orbit around the Earth, the [[S-IVB]] third stage of the [[Saturn V]] was reignited to send them to the Moon.

During the retrieval of the LM from its stowed position below the CSM, a light came on the control panel that indicated the valves of the Service Propulsion System were open and the engine should be firing. A short was found in a switch that controlled on the redundant valves for the engine. New procedures were developed to deal with this. During their first inspection of the LM, Scott and Irwin found that the glass cover of a tapemeter had broken forcing them to clean up the glass shards lest they breathe them in.

On the fourth day they entered into lunar orbit and prepared for lunar descent.

===Solo operations===
{{main|Apollo 15, Solo operations}}
During the three day explorations of the Moon by Scott and Irwin, Worden had a busy schedule of observations. ''Apollo 15'' was the first mission to carry the SIM bay, which contained a [[panorama|panoramic]] camera, [[gamma ray spectrometer]], [[mapping]] camera, [[laser]] [[altimeter]] and [[mass spectrometer]]. Worden had to operate the [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] and [[optical device|lens]]es on the camera and turn on and off the various instruments. During the coast back to Earth, he would perform an EVA to retrieve film cassettes from the cameras.

===Lunar surface===

''Apollo 15'' was the first mission to perform three EVAs on the lunar surface. After landing at [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/lunar_sites.html 26°8&amp;#8242; N 3°38&amp;#8242; E], Scott removed the top hatch of the LM to perform a site survey and get a brief overview of the surrounding areas. The first EVA took the crew on the Rover to the base of Mount Hadley Delta. Back at the LM the crew started the deployment of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package (ALSEP). Scott had extreme difficulty drilling the holes for the heat-flow experiment, forcing him to come back the next day to complete the task.

The second EVA again took Scott and Irwin to the base of Mount Hadley Delta but they went up its slope. Here they found the [[Genesis Rock]]. Returning to the LM, Scott completed the heat flow holes and began on a core sample which once again was extremely difficult to drill. He was once again forced to leave it for the next day.

The difficulties with the core sample meant the cancellation of the traverse to the North Complex. The crew still travelled to the edge of Hadley Rille. Returning to the LM for the last time, Scott dropped a falcon feather and his geology hammer to show that in gravity fields, the mass of the object does not affect the rate at which it falls.

On LRV 1, a plaque was attached bearing the inscription:
:MANS FIRST WHEELS ON THE MOON, DELIVERED BY FALCON, JULY 30, 1971
And the signatures of the Apollo 15 Astronauts.

===Return to Earth===
{{main|Apollo 15, Return to Earth}}
After lifting off from the lunar surface, ''Falcon'' and ''Endeavour'' rendezvoused and docked. After transferring across the lunar samples and other equipment, ''Falcon'' was jettisoned. It would fire its rocket engine to cause it to impact the lunar surface.  During lunar liftoff, the [[United States Air Force]] song &quot;Wild Blue Yonder&quot; was played, signifying the all-Air Force makeup of the Apollo 15 crew.

''Apollo 15'' spent one more day in lunar orbit, continuing the observations of Worden. After releasing a subsatellite, they ignited their Service Propulsion system to put them on a trajectory back to Earth. The next day, Worden performed an EVA to retrieve the film cassettes from the SIM bay cameras.

The twelfth day in space was uneventful, with Mission Control holding a press conference where the astronauts were asked questions submitted by the news media. On their 13th and final day they prepared for reentry. During descent one of their parachutes failed, meaning they landed under only two.

==The stamp controversy==
[[Image:Apollo 15 Space Suit David Scott.jpg|thumb|Dave Scott's space suit on display at the [[National Air and Space Museum|NASM]].]]

After a highly successful mission, the reputation of the crew was tarnished somewhat by a deal they made with [[H. Walter Eiermann]], an American citizen who had many professional and social contacts to NASA employees and the astronaut corps. Scott had carried 398 unauthorized [[First day of issue|First-Day Cover]]s in his spacesuit. Eiermann, had promised each astronaut [[United States dollar|US$]]7000 in the form of [[Savings deposit|savings accounts]] in return for 100 covers signed after having returned from the Moon. He told them that he would not advertise or sell the covers until the end of the Apollo program.

Scott sent 100 of these covers to Eiermann to [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]].  Eiermann then passed them on to the stamp dealer [[Herman E. Sieger]] from [[Lorch]], [[Germany]], who had previously approached him and had suggested the deal. Sieger proceeded to sell the covers for an average price of US$1,500 in a public sale in Germany. On hearing these news, Scott contacted Eiermann, asking him to stop the sale. The crew also decided against receiving any money from Eiermann. NASA took possession of the remaining 298 covers.

All three crew members were formally reprimanded and their official [[Efficiency Report]]s as military officers were changed to reflect a formal finding of &quot;lack of judgment&quot;.

Another minor controversy centered around two [[timepiece]]s, a [[wristwatch|watch]] and [[stopwatch]], carried by Scott. He had agreed to evaluate the timepieces for the manufacturer at the request of a friend. Thinking they might be useful, particularly for the possible timing of a manually controlled emergency propulsion maneuver, Scott took them along on the mission without prior authorization.

One final controversial event happened after the flight. The crew had contacted Belgian [[Sculpture|sculptor]] [[Paul Van Hoeydonck]] to create a small statuette to personally commemorate those astronauts and cosmonauts having lost their lives in the furtherance of space exploration. The small [[aluminium]] sculpture called &quot;[[Fallen Astronaut]]&quot; was left on the Moon, along with a plaque bearing the names of fourteen American and Russian astronauts and cosmonauts. They had agreed with Van Hoeydonck that no replicas were to be made. After mentioning the statuette during their post-flight press conference, the [[National Air and Space Museum]] contacted the crew asking for a replica made for the museum. The crew agreed under the condition that it was to be displayed with good taste and without publicity. Van Hoeydonck was contacted to make the replicas. In May 1972 Scott learned that Van Hoeydonck planned to make more replicas and sell them. Van Hoeydonck could not be persuaded not to and 950 replicas were sold for $750 apiece at the [[Waddell Gallery]] of [[New York]].

==Introduction==
[[Image:a16-plaque.jpg|right|thumb|depiction of the plaque left on the moon by Apollo 16]]
The crew members: [[John W. Young]], commander; [[Ken Mattingly]], command module pilot; and [[Charles Duke]], lunar module pilot. It was a J-class mission, featuring a [[Lunar Rover]]. It brought back 94.7 kg of lunar samples. It included three lunar [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]: 7.2 hours, 7.4 hours, 5.7 hours and one trans-earth EVA of 1.4. This was only the second trans-earth EVA ever and was used to bring in film from exterior cameras and conduct an experiment on microbial survival.

The Apollo 16 subsatellite was launched from the CSM while it was in lunar orbit. The subsatellite carried out experiments on magnetic fields and solar particles. It was launched [[April 24]], [[1972]] at 21:56:09 UTC and orbited the Moon for 34 days and 425 revolutions. It had a mass of 80 lb (36.3 kg) and consisted of a central cylinder and three 1.5 m booms.

Enroute to the moon, the Apollo 16 astronauts took several photos of Earth.  One of which was with North America in the background, with much of the northern portion of the continent under extensive cloud cover.  This photo would later be used as a backdrop for the opening sequence of television's [[World Class Championship Wrestling]], a Dallas-based professional wrestling organization, from 1983 to 1987.

==Mission highlights==

[[Image:Apollo_16_LM_Orion.jpg|thumb|360px|John Young works at the LRV near the LM Orion (NASA)]]

A malfunction in a yaw gimbal servo loop in the main propulsion system of the CSM &quot;Casper&quot; caused concerns about firing the engine to adjust the CSM's lunar orbit, and nearly caused the Moon landing to be scrubbed. But it was decided that the malfunction presented relatively little risk, and Young and Duke (who were already undocked, and flying LM &quot;Orion&quot; when the problem occurred) were permitted to land on the Moon.  However, the mission was shortened by a day (reducing the time in orbit around the Moon after the LM left the Moon and docked with the CSM), as a safety measure.

Young and Duke spent three days exploring the Descartes highland region, while Mattingly circled overhead in &quot;Casper.&quot; The astronauts discovered that what was thought to have been a region of volcanism was actually a region full of impact-formed rocks (breccias). Their collection of returned specimens included an 25 pound (11 kg) chunk that was the largest single rock returned by the Apollo astronauts (nicknamed ''Big Muley''). The Apollo 16 astronauts also conducted performance tests with the lunar rover, at one time getting up to a top speed of 11 miles per hour (18 kilometers per hour), which still stands as the record speed for any wheeled vehicle on the Moon (listed as such in the [[Guinness Book of Records]]).

===Relics===
The command module is currently at the [[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]], in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. The lunar module ascent stage separated [[24 April]] [[1972]] but a loss of attitude control rendered it out of control. It orbited the Moon for about a year. Its impact site on the Moon is unknown.

One of the last two men to set foot on the Moon was also the first scientist-astronaut, geologist Harrison Schmitt. While Evans circled in &quot;America,&quot; Schmitt and Cernan collected a record 240 pounds (109 kilograms) of rocks during three Moonwalks. The crew roamed for 21 miles (34 kilometers) through the Taurus-Littrow valley in their rover, discovered orange-colored soil, and left the most comprehensive set of instruments in the ALSEP on the lunar surface.  Their mission was the last in the Apollo lunar program. 

===Introduction===
Crew members were [[Gene Cernan]], commander; [[Ron Evans]], command module pilot; and [[Harrison Schmitt]], lunar module pilot.

The landing site for this mission was on the southeastern rim of the [[Mare Serenitatis]], in the southwestern [[Montes Taurus]]. This was a dark mantle between three high, steep [[massif]]s, in an area known as the Taurus-Littrow region. Pre-mission photographs showed boulders deposited along the bases of the mountains, which could provide bedrock samples. The area also contained a landslide, several impact craters, and some dark craters which could be volcanic.

A J-class mission, featuring the [[Lunar Rover]], they conducted three lunar surface excursions, lasting 7.2, 7.6 and 7.3 hours. The mission returned 243.6 lb (110.5 kg) of samples from the Moon.

The Command module is currently on display at NASA's [[Johnson Space Center]], in [[Houston, Texas]]. The lunar module impacted the Moon on [[15 December]] [[1972]] at 06:50:20.8 UT (1:50 AM EST) at 19.96 N, 30.50 E. 

On this mission the astronauts took a famous photograph of the earth known as &quot;[[The Blue Marble]]&quot;.

===Mission notes===
*Schmitt, a [[geologist]], was the first (and to date, only) scientist to walk on the Moon.

*Like the astronauts of Apollos [[Apollo 10|10]], [[Apollo 12|12]], [[Apollo 13|13]], and [[Apollo 14|14]] before it, the Apollo 17 crew were recovered in [[Pacific]] waters near [[American Samoa]] after [[splashdown]], and were flown from the recovery ship to the airport at [[Tafuna, American Samoa|Tafuna]] where they were greeted with an enthusiastic (and well practiced!) Samoan reception before being flown on to [[Honolulu]], thence to [[Houston]].

* The [[lunar plaques|plaque]] left on the ladder of the descent stage of [[Challenger]] read: ''Here Man completed his first explorations of the moon. December 1972 AD.  May the spirit of peace in which we came be reflected in the lives of all mankind''.  The plaque showed two hemispheres of Earth and the near side of the Moon, plus the signatures of Cernan, Evans, Schmitt, and [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]].

* Commander [[Eugene Cernan]] left a Czechoslovak flag on the Moon because his ancestors came from  [[Czechoslovakia]]. 

*Schmitt was originally due to fly on the cancelled Apollo 18 but following pressure from the science community was moved up to LM pilot on Apollo 17 in place of [[Joe Engle]].

*Apollo 17 broke several records set by previous flights, including longest manned lunar landing flight; longest total lunar surface extravehicular activities; largest lunar sample return, and longest time in lunar orbit.

==Quotes==

&quot;As I take man's last step from the surface, back home for some time to come - but we believe not too long into the future &amp;mdash; I'd like to just [say] what I believe history will record. That America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow. And, as we leave the Moon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind. Godspeed the crew of Apollo 17.&quot;

:&amp;mdash; Eugene A. Cernan, Apollo 17 Commander. Last man to walk on the moon, [[14 December]] [[1972]].

&quot;Okay, Jack.  Let's get this mother outta here.&quot;

:&amp;mdash; Eugene A. Cernan, Apollo 17 Commander.  Apocryphal last 'informal' words said on the lunar surface, one second before lunar liftoff.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''American Revolution''' ended two centuries of British rule for most of the North American colonies and created the modern United States of America. The Revolutionary era was both exhilarating and disturbing---a time of progress for some, dislocation for others. In the wake of the Revolution came events as varied as the drafting and ratification of the Constitution of the United States of America and the rebellions of slaves who saw the contrast between slavery and proclamations of liberty. The American Revolution is the series of events, ideas, and changes that resulted in the [[revolution]] and ensuing political separation of [[thirteen colonies]] in [[North America]] from the [[British Empire]] and the creation of the [[United States|United States of America]] with a new political system. The [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] (1775&amp;ndash;1783) was one part of the revolution, but the revolution by the Americans began before the [[Shot heard 'round the world|first shot]] was fired at [[Battle of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] and continued after the British surrender at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]]. Years later, in 1818, [[John Adams]] wrote: &quot;The Revolution was effected before the War commenced,&quot; and &quot;The [[Revolution]] was in the minds and hearts of the people.&quot; 

The precise nature and extent of the revolution is a matter of great interpretation. It is generally agreed that the revolution originated around the time of the [[French and Indian War]] (1754&amp;ndash;1763), and ended with the election of [[George Washington]] as the first [[President of the United States]] in 1789. Beyond that, interpretations vary. At one end of the spectrum is the view that the American Revolution was not &quot;revolutionary&quot; at all, that it did not radically transform colonial society, but 'simply replaced a distant government with a local one'. The opposite view is that the American Revolution was a unique and radical event, producing significant changes that had a profound impact on world history. Most current interpretations fall somewhere in between these two positions.
[[Image:map of territorial growth 1775.jpg|thumb|300px|Before the Revolution: The [[13 colonies]] are in red, the pink area was claimed by Great Britain after the [[French and Indian War]], and the orange region was claimed by [[Spain]]. Note that this map does not show the bulk of [[British North America]] of that time.]]

==Origins==
In the early 1760's, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] possessed a [[British North America|vast empire]] on the North American continent. In addition to the thirteen British colonies, victory in the [[Seven Years' War]] had given Great Britain claim over [[New France]] ([[Canada]]), [[History of Florida|Spanish Florida]], and the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lands east of the [[Mississippi River]]. A war against France's former Indian allies&amp;mdash;[[Pontiac's Rebellion]]&amp;mdash;had, if not conquered, at least 'pacified' the western frontier. At this time, most white colonists in America considered themselves loyal subjects of the British Crown, with the same rights and obligations as Englishmen in Britain.

===Philosophy and radical thought=== 
[[The Enlightenment]] elevated [[natural philosophy]], and began to replace arguments born of tradition and authority with those based upon observation and independent reasoning. The implications of the earlier [[scientific revolution]] began to have a greater effect on everyday life and in the conscious thought of men everywhere. Increased publication and communications between like-minded people opened up new areas to question and consideration. The early works of thinkers like [[John Locke]] became the analysis of men like [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]]. The [[Deism|deist]] views of several of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], and their views on the proper form of government have roots in this European Enlightenment, and were a source for ideas regarding [[separation of church and state]] and other liberties. In addition, the ideas of &quot;[[social contract]]&quot; and &quot;[[natural rights]]&quot;, espoused by [[John Locke]], formed the basis of political reasonings.

===Road to rebellion===
After the [[French and Indian War]] and Pontiac's Rebellion, the British government sought to overhaul its expansive North American possessions. In order to make the Empire more stable and profitable, new economic and land distribution policies were implemented. Specifically, the new British policies included the understandable desire of the crown that the colonists would shoulder a greater share of the burdens of war and the cost of their own defense, as well as the curtailment of smuggling with the colonies of the West Indies, the payment of royal tariffs and the exclusive with the British homeland.

===Economic disputes, 1760-70 ===
King George wanted the colonists' money. The British national debt had risen to alarming levels during the war years and so in 1760 [[the Crown]] began a series of economic initiatives designed to extract more revenue from the colonies. These policies were 'justifiable', the reasoning went, because the colonists were enjoying the benefits of the peace that had been won. 
[[Image:James Otis.gif|thumb|right|100px|James Otis]]
In theory, Great Britain already [[mercantilism|regulated the economies]] of the colonies through the [[Navigation Acts]], but widespread evasion of these laws had long been tolerated. Now, through the use of open-ended search warrants ([[Writs of Assistance]]), strict enforcement became the practice. In 1761, Massachusetts lawyer [[James Otis]] argued that the writs violated the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional rights]] of the colonists. He lost the case, but [[John Adams]] later wrote, &quot;American independence was then and there born.&quot;

In 1763, [[Patrick Henry]] argued the [[Parson's Cause]] case.  Clerical pay had been tied to the price of tobacco by Virginia legislation.  When the price of tobacco skyrocketed after a bad crop in 1758, the [[House of Burgesses|Virginia legislature]] passed the Two-Penny Act to stop clerical salaries from inflating as well.  In 1763, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] vetoed the Two-Penny Act. Patrick Henry defended the law in court and argued &quot;that a King, by disallowing Acts of this salutary nature, from being the father of his people, degenerated into a Tyrant and forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience.&quot;

In 1764, [[British Prime Minister]] [[George Grenville]]'s [[Sugar Act]] and [[Currency Act]] created economic hardship in the colonies. Protests led to the boycott of British goods, and to the emergence of the popular slogan &quot;[[no taxation without representation]],&quot; in which colonists argued that only their colonial assemblies, and not [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], could levy taxes on them. [[Committee of correspondence|Committees of correspondence]] were formed in the colonies to coordinate resistance to paying the taxes. In previous years, the colonies had shown little inclination towards collective action. Grenville's policies were bringing them together.

A milestone in the Revolution occurred in 1765, when Grenville passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], as a way to finance the quartering of troops in North America. The Stamp Act required all legal documents, permits, commercial contracts, newspapers, pamphlets, and playing cards in the colonies to carry a [[stamp duty|tax stamp]].

Colonial protest was widespread. Secret societies known as the [[Sons of Liberty]] were formed in every colony, and used [[propaganda]], intimidation, and mob violence to prevent the enforcement of the Stamp Act. The furor culminated with the &quot;[[Stamp Act Congress]]&quot;, which sent a formal protest to Parliament in October of 1765. Parliament responded by repealing the Stamp Act, but pointedly [[Declaratory Act|declared its legal authority]] over the colonies &amp;#8220;in all cases whatsoever.&amp;#8221;

[[Image:Boston Massacre.jpg|300px|right|thumb|This exaggerated depiction of the &quot;[[Boston Massacre]]&quot; by [[Paul Revere]] was designed to inflame opposition to the military occupation of Boston.]]

The sequel to the Stamp Act was not long in coming. In 1767, Parliament passed the [[Townshend Acts]], placing taxes on a number of common goods imported into the colonies, including glass, paint, lead, paper, and tea. In response, colonial leaders organized boycotts of these British imports.  On [[June 10]], [[1768]], the ''Liberty'', a ship belonging to colonial merchant [[John Hancock]] and suspected of smuggling, was seized by customs officials in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Angry protests on the street led customs officials, fearing for their safety, to report to London that Boston was in a state of insurrection.

British troops began to arrive in Boston in October of 1768. Tensions continued to mount; culminating in the &quot;[[Boston Massacre]]&quot; on [[March 5]], [[1770]], when British soldiers of the [[29th Regiment of Foot]] fired into an angry mob, killing five. Revolutionary agitators, like [[Samuel Adams]], used the event to stir up popular resistance, but, after the trial of the soldiers, who were defended by [[John Adams]], tensions diminished.

The Townshend Acts were repealed in 1770, after much colonial protest, and it was still theoretically possible that further bloodshed in the colonies might be avoided. However, the British government had left one tax from the Townshend Acts in place as a symbolic gesture of their right to tax the colonies&amp;mdash;the tax on tea. For the revolutionaries, who stood firm on the principle that only their colonial representatives could levy taxes on them, it was still &quot;one tax too many&quot;. This resulted in the [[Boston Tea Party]].

===Western land dispute===
The [[British Royal Proclamation of 1763|Proclamation of 1763]] sought to limit the conflicts between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s and the English settlers by restricting settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. However, groups of settlers, led for example by [[Daniel Boone]], continued to move into the region beyond the Proclamation Line and fought with the [[Shawnee]]s and other peoples inhabiting the area. Furthermore, the [[Quebec Act]] of 1774, extended [[Quebec]]'s boundaries to the [[Ohio River]], reestablished [[Civil Code of Quebec#Under the British Empire|French civil law]], and instituted toleration for [[Roman Catholic]]s in that territory, an action which horrified some colonials, who had come to New England to establish their own [[protestant]] sects.  Proposals to post British regulars to man forts in the west further disquieted Americans eager to occupy Indian land.

===Crises, 1772-75===
While there were many causes of the American Revolution, it was a series of specific events, or crises, that finally triggered the outbreak of war.    

[[Image:Gaspee Affair.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Burning of the ''Gaspee'']]

The first of these was the [[Gaspée Affair]]. The ''HMS Gaspée'', a British ship that had been vigorously enforcing unpopular trade regulations (the [[Navigation Acts]]), ran aground on [[June 9]], [[1772]], off of [[Narragansett Bay]] in [[Rhode Island]], while chasing the packet boat ''Hannah''. In an act of defiance that gained considerable notoriety, the ship was attacked, boarded, stripped of valuables and torched by American patriots, who later denied knowing about the entire affair.

[[Image:Boston tea party.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This 1846 lithograph has become a classic image of the Boston Tea Party.]]

The next crisis was a result of the so-called &quot;[[Tea Act]]&quot;, passed by the British Parliament in 1773.  This act allowed the [[British East India Company]] to sell [[tea]] to the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colonies]] without the usual colonial [[tax]], thereby allowing it to undercut the prices of the colonial merchants. To help pay for its colony in [[India]], the British government intended to give the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] a [[monopoly]] on tea imports to the colonies; this, however, backfired. Because many American merchants earned their living from [[smuggling]], this act would take away their livelihood. The result was widespread [[boycott]]s of tea throughout the colonies, and, eventually, to the [[Boston Tea Party]] where American colonists, believed to be the [[Sons of Liberty]], dressed up like Indians and threw crates of tea from the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] ships into the [[Boston Harbor]]. 

The [[Intolerable Acts]], called by the British the &quot;Coercive Acts&quot; or &quot;Punitive Acts&quot;, were a series of laws, passed by the [[British Parliament]] in 1774, in response to the growing unrest in the thirteen [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]], particularly in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] with its [[Boston Tea Party]]. Enforcement of the Acts played a major role in the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the establishment of the [[Continental Congress|First Continental Congress]]. 

The Intolerable Acts included:
*[[Massachusetts Government Act]]	 
*[[Administration of Justice Act]]	 
*[[Boston Port Act]]	 
*[[Quartering Act]]

The [[First Continental Congress]] was convened in 1774 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and endorsed the [[Suffolk Resolves]], which declared the Intolerable Acts to be unconstitutional, called for the people to form [[militia]]s, and for [[Massachusetts]] to form a Patriot government. 

In response, primarily to the Massachusetts Government Act, the inhabitants of Worcester, Massachusetts set up an armed picket line in front of the local courthouse and refused to allow the British magistrates to enter.  The magistrates, faced with over 1500 armed men, did not attempt to force entry.  Thereafter, the town of Worcester largely governed itself.  Similar events occurred, soon after, all across the colony. British troops were sent from England, but, by the time they arrived, the entire colony of Massachusetts, with the exception of the heavily garrisoned city of Boston, had thrown off British control of local affairs.

The [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Battle of Lexington and Concord]] were the first [[battle]]s of the [[American Revolutionary War]].  They were fought on [[April 19]], [[1775]] in [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] within the towns of [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], [[Lincoln, Massachusetts|Lincoln]], [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Menotomy]], and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]. The battles marked the outbreak of open [[war]] between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the colonies and are known as the &quot;[[shot heard 'round the world]].&quot;  

The [[Second Continental Congress]] convened in 1775, after the war had started. 
While creating the [[Continental Army]], it also extended the [[Olive Branch Petition]] to the crown as an attempt at reconciliation. King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] refused to receive it, leaving the American Patriots no other choice but to wage war against Britain to achieve their Independence.

[[Image:joinordie.png|thumb|250px|This [[political cartoon]] (attributed to [[Benjamin Franklin]]) originally appeared during the [[French and Indian War]], but was recycled to encourage the American colonies to unite against British rule.]] 

The American revolutionaries, known as [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]]s (or Whigs or rebels), included many shades of opinion. [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Jay]] and [[George Washington]] represented a socially conservative faction that would later take shape as the [[Federalist party]] and are traditionally characterized as preoccupied with preserving the wealth and power of the &quot;better sorts&quot; of colonial society. [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Paine]] are usually portrayed as representing the less economically affluent side of society, accepting greater political equality.  After the revolution, some of these men would become known as the &quot;[[anti-federalists]]&quot; who, led by [[George Mason]], considered the [[Constitution of the United States]] to be a dangerously flawed document, one which would cause greater tyranny than either the British [[Parliament]] or the [[British Crown]] had.

A great many American colonists remained loyal to the British Crown; these became known as [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s (or 'Tories', or 'King's men'). Loyalists were often of the same well-to-do social circles that produced the right wing of the Patriots (for example [[Thomas Hutchinson]]); however, the Scottish highlanders of the [[Mohawk Valley]] and the frontiersmen of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] included a large number of poorer men. Some Loyalists were [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]], including [[Joseph Brant]], who led a mixed band of Indians and white farmers and laborers in the Loyalist cause; others were [[black Loyalist]]s.

After the war, [[United Empire Loyalists]] became a central component of the populations of the [[Abaco]] islands (in the [[Bahamas]]), and the [[Canada|Canadian]] provinces of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Ontario]], where many of them fled to escape persecution in the new United States.  Some of the African Americans, who had been freed from slavery by fighting for the British, were settled in [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]].

===Loyalists and Neutrals===
Main article [[Loyalist (American Revolution)]]

Some British North American colonists remained loyal subjects of the British crown during the American Revolution. They included those who were not convinced by the political arguments of the Patriots.They were called Loyalists (also called Tories or &quot;King's Men&quot;). 

From an American perspective, the Loyalists were traitors who turned against their fellow citizens and collaborated with the enemy, while Loyalists themselves considered the American rebels the traitors.

Loyalists took some part in fighting, especially near Canada. 70,000 left the 13 colonies during or after the war. About 45,000 later settled in Canada, which they profoundly influenced. 

In addition, a vast number of colonists in the thirteen colonies, perhaps over half, chose to stay neutral in the highly political American Revolution. While patriots undoubtedly outnumbered loyalists, the neutrals probably outnumbered both groups.

===Class differences among the Patriots===
Just as there were rich and poor Loyalists, the Patriots were a 'mixed lot', and often had different aims for the revolution.  Wealthy Patriots viewed independence as a means of freeing themselves from British taxation and limitations on taking western land, but had every intention of remaining in control of the resulting nation.  Many craftsmen, small merchants and small farmers, however, were looking at independence as a means of reducing the power and privilege of the elite. Wealthy Patriots knew that they needed the support of the lower classes, but were fearful of their more radical democratic aims. John Adams (an elite more by education than by wealth) attacked Thomas Paine's ''[[Common Sense]]'' for the &quot;absurd democratical notions&quot; it proposed.

===Women===
[[Image:Abigail Adams.jpg|left|thumb|120px|[[Abigail Adams]].]]

The boycott of British goods would have been entirely unworkable without the willing participation of American women: women made the bulk of household purchases, and the boycotted items were largely household items such as tea and cloth.  And as cloth was still a basic necessity, for the boycott to work, women would have to return to spinning and weaving, skills that had fallen into disuse. In 1769, the women of Boston produced 40,000 skeins of yarn, and 180 women in Middletown, Massachusetts wove 20,522 yards of cloth.

As the Revolution progressed and economic disruption deepened, women participated directly in the food riots and [[tar and feather]]ing that was the people's response to price gouging by merchants, Loyalist and Patriot alike.  On [[August 24]], [[1777]], [[Thomas Boyleston]], a Patriot merchant who was withholding coffee and sugar from the market waiting for prices to rise, was confronted by a crowd of 100 or more women, who seized the keys to his warehouse and distributed the coffee themselves while a large crowd of men stood by and watched, dumbfounded.

===Writing the state constitutions===
By 1776, the colonies had overthrown their existing government, closing courts and driving British agents and governors from their homes, and they had elected conventions and &quot;legislatures&quot; that existed outside of any legal framework whatsoever&amp;mdash; new constitutions were desperately needed in each colony to replace the superseded royal charters.

On [[January 5]], [[1776]], [[New Hampshire]] ratified the first state constitution, six months before the signing of the [[Declaration of Independence]]. Then, in May 1776, Congress voted to suppress all forms of crown authority, to be replaced by locally created authority.  [[Virginia]], [[South Carolina]], and [[New Jersey]] created their constitutions before July 4.  [[Rhode Island]] and [[Connecticut]] simply took their existing [[royal charter]]s and deleted all references to the crown.

The new states had to decide not only what form of government to create, they first had to decide how to select those who would craft the constitutions and how the resulting document would be ratified.  This would be just the start of a process that would pit conservatives against radicals in each state.  In states where the wealthy exerted firm control over the process, such as [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[Delaware]], [[New York]] and [[Massachusetts]], the result was constitutions that featured: 
*substantial property qualifications for voting and even more substantial requirements for elected positions (though New York and Maryland lowered property qualifications);
*[[bicameral legislature]]s, with the upper house as a check on the lower;
*strong governors, with [[veto]] power over the legislature and substantial appointment authority;
*few or no restraints on individuals holding multiple positions in government;
*the continuation of state-established religion.

In states where the less affluent had organized sufficiently to have significant power, especially [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Vermont]], the resulting constitutions embodied:

*universal white manhood suffrage, or minimal property requirements for voting or holding office (New Jersey went so far as to enfranchise women, a radical step that they retracted 25 years later);
[[Image:Benjamin_Rush_Painting_by_Peale_1783.jpg|140px|thumb|Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]], 1783]]
*strong, [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislatures]];
*relatively weak governors, without veto powers, and little appointing authority;
*prohibition against individuals holding multiple government posts;
*disestablishment of religion.

Naturally, the fact that conservatives or radicals held sway in a state did not mean that the side with less power accepted the result quietly.  In Pennsylvania, the propertied class was horrified by their new constitution ([[Benjamin Rush]] called it &quot;our state dung cart&quot;), while in Massachusetts, voters twice rejected the constitution that was presented for ratification; it was ultimately ratified only as a result of the legislature tinkering with the third vote.  The radical provisions of Pennsylvania's constitution were to last only fourteen years&amp;mdash; in 1790, conservatives gained power in the state legislature, called a new constitutional convention, and wrote a new constitution that substantially reduced universal white-male suffrage, gave the governor veto power and patronage appointment authority, and added an upper house with substantial wealth qualifications to the unicameral legislature.  Thomas Paine called it a constitution unworthy of America.

==War for independence, 1775-83==
[[image:commonsense.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Common Sense by Thomas Paine]]
[[Image:Yorktown80.JPG|thumb|right|280px|The Battle of Yorktown was the last major battle of the American Revolutionary War. It ended with the surrender of British forces.]]
''Main article: [[American Revolutionary War]]''

On January 10, 1776, [[Thomas Paine]] published a pamphlet entitled ''[[Common Sense]]'' arguing that the only solution to the problems with Britain was [[Republicanism]] and independence from Great Britain. 

On July 4, 1776, the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] was ratified by the [[Second Continental Congress]].

The '''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union''', commonly known as the '''[[Articles of Confederation]]''', formed the first governing document of the [[United States|United States of America]]. They combined the colonies of the [[American Revolutionary War]] into a loose [[confederation]] of sovereign [[states]]. The second [[Continental Congress]] adopted the Articles on November 15, 1777.

==America after the war==
The American Revolution saw several noteworthy political innovations: the [[separation of church and state]], which ended the special privileges of the [[Church of England]]  in the South and the [[Congregationalist]] Church in [[New England]]; an assertion of liberty, individual rights and equality which would prove highly appealing in Europe; the idea that government should be by consent of the governed (including the right of rebellion against tyranny); the delegation of power to the government through written constitutions; and the notion that colonial peoples of the Americas could become self-governing nations in their own rights.

All was not well, however, in the new nation. 

The [[Shays Rebellion]] was an armed uprising in [[Western Massachusetts]] that lasted from 1786 to 1787.  Many of the rebels, known as [[Shaysites]] or Regulators, were small farmers angered by high debt and tax burdens. A state [[militia]] that had been raised as a private army defeated the Shaysites.  The lack of a government force to respond to the uprising led some to re-evaluate of the effectiveness of the [[Articles of Confederation]]. 

The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] had given the U.S. government control, on paper, of all land east of the [[Mississippi River]] and south of the [[Great Lakes]], but the Native American nations actually living in this region were not a party to this treaty and had not been militarily defeated by the Patriots. Further, the British remained in possession of the Great Lakes forts through which they continued to supply their Native American allies with trade items (including weapons) and to otherwise stir up trouble for Americans. 

Then, Congress sought to stabilize the dollar and pay down its war debt through the sale of western lands still under Native American control. The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] gave encouragement to land speculators, surveyors, and so on, who sought to gain this land-- sometimes through bribery or deceit--for resale to white settlers. Congress negotiated a treaty with Native Americans in 1785 to acquire most of the eastern portion of [[Ohio Country]] for settlement.  However, settlers were already moving into land that the treaty set aside for the tribes.  Conflict soon broke out, as the [[Northwest Indian War]].  Due to the lack of an army under the Confederation government, Congress was unable to successfully fight the tribes.  

These events and others led the Continental Congress to support the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in [[1787]], leading to the creation of a new central government that lasts to this day in the United States.

==The impact on British North America==
For tens of thousands of inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies, the victory of the revolutionaries was followed by exile. Approximately fifty thousand [[United Empire Loyalists]] fled to the remaining British colonies in North America, such as the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]], (concentrating in the [[Eastern Townships]]), [[Upper Canada]] (now known as [[Ontario]]), and [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Nova Scotia]] (where their presence would result in the creation of [[New Brunswick]]). This exodus sowed the seeds for the French-English duality in British North America, arguably the most prominent political and cultural feature of what would one day become [[Canada]].

==Revolution beyond America==
The American Revolution was the first wave of the [[Atlantic Revolutions]] that would also take hold in the [[French Revolution]], the [[Haitian Revolution]], and the [[Bolívar's War|Latin American wars of liberation]]. [[Aftershock]]s would also be felt in [[Ireland]] in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rising]], in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and in the [[Netherlands]]. 

The Revolution had a strong immediate impact in Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. Many British and Irish [[Whig]]s had been openly indulgent to the Patriots in America, and the Revolution was the first lesson in politics for many European radicals who would later take on active roles during the era of the [[French Revolution]].  Jefferson's Declaration had [http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap3a.html an immediate impact] on the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]] of 1789. 

The American Revolution affected the rest of the world. The thinkers of the [[Enlightenment]] only wrote that common people had the right to overthrow unjust governments. The American Revolution was a case of practical success, which provided the rest of the world with a 'working model'.

The American Revolution set an example to the people in Europe and other parts of the world. It encouraged the people to realize they had rights independent of the sovereign; it promoted republicanism to overthrow monarchs.  It incited people to fight for their rights, and it showed them that it was possible to win even against the world's foremost power, Great Britain. 

Nowhere was the influence of the American Revolution more profound than in Latin America, where American writings and the model of colonies, which actually broke free and thrived decisively, shaped their struggle for independence. Historians of Latin America have identified many links to the U.S. model .  See

==Legacy and interpretations==
The American Revolution is often cited as a milestone in the history of [[American Exceptionalism]]. The [[intellectual]]s of the Revolution ([[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Common Sense]]'' is most likely the best example) for the first time expressed the belief that America was not just an extension of Europe but a new land, a country of nearly unlimited potential and opportunity that was being abused by the British mother country they had outgrown. These sentiments laid the intellectual foundations for the Revolutionary concept of American exceptionalism and was closely tied to [[Republicanism]], the belief that sovereignty belonged to the people, not to a hereditary ruling class.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sir Alan Ayckbourn''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born [[April 12]], [[1939]]) is a popular and prolific [[England|English]] [[playwright]]. He is frequently cited as being the second most-performed English language playwright, after [[William Shakespeare]].

==Life==
Ayckbourn was born in [[London]] and wrote his first play at prep school when he was about 10. At [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury]], he toured [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]] with the school Shakespeare company. He left school at 17 to go straight into the theatre with an introduction to Sir [[Donald Wolfit]] by his French master. Ayckbourn joined Wolfit on tour as an [[Stage management|assistant stage manager]] and [[actor]].

By 1957, Ayckbourn was acting with director [[Stephen Joseph]] at [[Scarborough]]. In 1959 he played Stanley in the second production of writer-director [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''The Birthday Party''. 

Ayckbourn has written and produced some sixty plays in Scarborough and London and is the artistic director of the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]] in Scarborough. Almost all of his plays receive their first performance at this theatre. More than 25 have subsequently been produced in the [[West End theatre|West End]], at the [[Royal National Theatre]] or by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] since his first hit ''[[Relatively Speaking]]'' opened at the Duke of York's Theatre in 1967. 

Major successes include ''[[Absurd Person Singular]]'', The [[Norman Conquests trilogy]], ''[[Bedroom Farce (comedy)|Bedroom Farce]]'', ''[[Just Between Ourselves]]'', ''[[A Chorus Of Disapproval]]'', ''[[Woman In Mind]]'', ''[[A Small Family Business]]'', ''[[Man Of The Moment]]'' and House &amp; Garden. His plays have won numerous awards, including seven London Evening Standard Awards. They have been translated into over 30 languages and are performed on stage and television throughout the world. 

Ayckbourn plays have also been filmed in French and English. Four of his plays have been seen on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] attracting two [[Tony Awards|Tony]] nominations. In 1991, he received a Dramalogue Critics Award for his play ''[[Henceforward...]]''.

Although his plays have received major West End productions almost from the beginning of his writing career, and hence have been reviewed in [[United Kingdom newspapers|British newspapers]], Ayckbourn's work was for years routinely dismissed as being too slight for serious study. Recently scholars have begun to view Ayckbourn as an important commentator on the lifestyles of the British [[suburb]]an [[middle class]] and as a stylistic innovator, experimenting with theatrical styles within the boundaries set by popular tastes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Architectural engineers''' apply the skills of many engineering disciplines to the design, construction, operation, maintenance and renovation of buildings while paying attention to their impacts on the surrounding environment. In countries such as Canada, the UK and Australia, architectural engineering is more commonly known as '''Building Engineering'''. In some languages, &quot;architect&quot; is literally translated as &quot;architectural engineer&quot;.

==Difference from component disciplines==
What differentiates architectural engineering from its component disciplines is the effort to understand and design for the integration of all the building systems. [[Civil engineering|Civil Engineers]], for instance, can and do design the structure of a building.  The Architectural Engineer with a specialization in structures may understand and accommodate not only the structural requirements for a building, but also the architectural, [[HVAC]], plumbing, electrical, transportation, acoustic requirements - only the most common of those usually considered problematic.

==Difference from architecture==
A common confusion  is the distinction between [[architecture]] and architectural engineering.  In essence, architectural engineering is a component of architecture. [[Architects]] are directly responsible for the form and appearance of a building, including the way in which people use and experience the spaces of the building, and they typically act as the leader of the design team.  They also coordinate the various engineering requirements of a building project. Architectural Engineering concentrates on ensuring that &quot;the building works&quot; (that it stands up, that the HVAC system operates, that light and power are delivered as needed).  

Architectural engineers, as a distinct and separate profession, are somewhat redundant in that their role overlaps that of the architect and other project engineers. Like architects, they seek to achieve optimum system selection and sizing within the overall constraints, except using primarily the tools of engineering. In most parts of the world, architectural engineers are not entitled to practice architecture unless they are architects, and are limited to one or more engineering disciplines. In some locations, such as Japan, architects are also known as architectural engineers.

==Major specializations==
* [[Architecture]]
* [[Structural engineering]]
* [[HVAC|HVAC - Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning engineering]]
* [[Electrical engineering|Building power systems]]
* [[Lighting]]
* [[Plumbing]]
* [[Fire protection engineering]]
* [[Building transportation system]]s
* [[Acoustics]]

'''Alpha Centauri''' (&amp;alpha; Cen / &amp;alpha; Centauri) is the brightest [[star system]] (a triple star system) in the southern [[constellation]] of [[Centaurus]], and contains the [[list of brightest stars|fourth brightest star]] in the night sky, with an [[apparent visual magnitude]] of &amp;minus;0.01. It is famous in the Southern Hemisphere as the outermost &amp;ldquo;pointer&amp;rdquo; to the [[Crux|Southern Cross]], but it is too far south to be visible in most of the northern hemisphere. To the naked eye, the two brightest components of the system are too close for the eye to be able to resolve them as separate stars, so it is perceived as a single source of light with a total visual magnitude of about &amp;minus;0.27, which is brighter than [[Arcturus]].

It is the closest [[star]] system beyond our own [[solar system]], at 4.2–4.4 [[light-year]]s. That makes it a logical choice as &quot;first port of call&quot; for [[science fiction]] speculation about space travel. In fact many [[novels]], [[video game]]s, and the like focus on man's eventual exploration of the system, and even colonisation of speculative [[planet]]s within the system.

==Names==
It bears the proper name '''Rigil Kentaurus''' (often shortened to '''Rigil Kent'''), derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase ''Al Rijl al Kentaurus'', meaning &quot;foot of the centaur,&quot;  but is nonetheless usually referred to by its [[Bayer designation]] ''Alpha Centauri''.  Another alternative name is '''Toliman'''. It is also sometimes known as '''Bungula''', possibly from the [[Latin]] word ''ungula'' meaning &quot;hoof&quot;. It and [[Beta Centauri]] (which is close to Alpha Centauri in [[angular]] distance as seen from the Earth, but is actually many light-years away) are the &quot;Pointers&quot; to the [[Crux|Southern Cross]]. Alpha and Beta Centauri are the second closest pair of first magnitude stars as seen from the Earth, and due to the effects of [[proper motion]], they will become the closest pair in around 2166, overtaking [[Acrux]] and [[Becrux]].

''Alpha Centauri A'' is also known as [[Henry Draper Catalogue|HD]] 128620, [[Harvard Revised catalogue|HR]] 5459, [[Cape Photographic Durchmusterung|CP-60°5483]], [[General Catalogue of Trigonometric Parallaxes|GCTP]] 3309.00A, and [[Luyten Half-Second Catalogue|LHS]] 50.
''Alpha Centauri B'' is also known as HD 128621, HR 5460, GCTP 3309.00B, and LHS 51.

==System components==
[[Image:Alpha Centauri relative sizes.png|thumb|left|300px|Size and color of the Sun compared to the stars in the Alpha Centauri system]]

Alpha Centauri is a triple star system. It consists of two main stars, ''Alpha Centauri A'' and ''Alpha Centauri B'' (which form a [[binary star]] together) at a distance of 4.36 [[light-year|ly]], and a dimmer [[red dwarf]] named [[Proxima Centauri]] at a distance of 4.22 ly. Both of the two main stars are rather similar to the [[Sun]].  The larger member of the binary star, ''Alpha Centauri A'', is the most similar to the [[Sun]], but a little larger and brighter. Like the Sun, its [[Stellar classification|spectral type]] is G2 V, and, like the sun, shines in a yellowish-white light. The smaller of the two, ''Alpha Centauri B'', is dimmer, with a spectral type of K1 V, somewhat smaller and dimmer than the sun, but astronomically similar enough, shining with more of an orangish-yellow-white light. The two orbit one another elliptically ([[Eccentricity (orbit) |e]]=0.52), approaching as close as 11.2 [[astronomical unit]]s (2&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt; ly) and receding to 35.6 AU (6&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt; ly), with a period of just under 80 years. Hence the sum of the two masses is &lt;math&gt;23.4^3/80^2=2.0&lt;/math&gt; times that of the Sun (see [[Two-body problem#Gravity|formula]]).

These two stars are about 5 to 6 billion years old.
The red dwarf Proxima Centauri is about 13,000 astronomical units away from Alpha Centauri (1 ly = 63,241 AU, hence this is 0.21 ly, about 1/20 of the distance between Alpha Centauri and the Sun, it is 0.14 ly closer to us) and may be in orbit about it, with a period on the order of 500,000 years or more. For this reason, Proxima is sometimes referred to as ''Alpha Centauri C''. However, it is not clear if it really is in orbit, although the association is unlikely to be entirely accidental as it shares approximately the same motion through space as the larger star system.

Seen from Earth, Proxima is separated by 2 degrees from Alpha Centauri A and B (about 4 times the angular diameter of the full Moon), and the latter are at an angular distance of up to 40&quot; from each other.
[[Image:AlphaCentauri_AB_Trajectory.gif|thumb|left|300px|Apparent and real trajectory of B component relative to A component]]
The closest neighbours to the Alpha Centauri system are the Sun and [[Barnard's star]] (1.98 [[parsec|pc]] or 6.47 ly), which is also the next nearest star from Earth, at a distance of 5.96 ly.

==Possibility of planet formation==
Computer models of planetary formation suggest that [[terrestrial planet]]s would be able to form close to both Alpha Centauri A and B, but that [[gas giant]] planets similar to our [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] would not be able to form because of the binary stars' gravitational effects. Given the similarities in star type, age and stability of the orbits it has been suggested that this solar system may hold one of the best possibilities for [[extraterrestrial life]]. However, some astronomers have speculated that any terrestrial planets in the Alpha Centauri system may be dry because it is believed that Jupiter and Saturn were crucial at directing [[comet]]s into the inner solar system and providing the inner planets with a source of [[water]]. This would not be a problem, however, if Alpha Centauri B happened to play a similar role for Alpha Centauri A that the gas giants do for the [[Sun]], and vice versa.  Both stars are of the right [[spectral type]] to harbor life on a potential planet (most astronomers believe that stars of spectral types from about F5 to K5 are hot enough, but long-lived and stable enough, to support potential Earthlike worlds).

A planet around Alpha Centauri A would be about 1.25 [[astronomical unit|AU]]'s away from the star if it were to have Earthlike temperatures, or about halfway between the distances of [[Earth]]'s orbit and [[Mars]]' orbit in our own [[solar system]].  For dimmer, cooler Alpha Centauri B, the distance would be about 0.7 [[AU]]'s, or about the distance of [[Venus]] from the [[Sun]].

==Sky appearance from Alpha Centauri==
Viewed from near Alpha Centauri, the sky (other than the Alpha Centauri stars) would appear very much as it does to observers on Earth, with most of the constellations such as [[Ursa Major]] and [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] being almost unchanged. However, Centaurus would be missing its brightest star and our [[Sun]] would appear as a 0.5-magnitude star in [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]. Roughly speaking, the \/\/ of Cassiopeia would become a /\/\/, with the Sun at the leftmost end, closest to [[Epsilon Cassiopeiae|&amp;epsilon; Cassiopeiae]]. The position can easily be plotted as [[right ascension|RA]] 02h39m35s, [[declination|dec]] +60°50', or [[antipodal point|antipodal]] to Alpha Centauri's position as seen from Earth.

Nearby very bright stars such as [[Sirius]] and [[Procyon]] would appear to be in very different positions, as would [[Altair]] to a lesser extent.  Sirius would become part of the constellation of Orion, appearing 2 degrees to the west of [[Betelgeuse]], slightly dimmer than from here (-1.2).  The stars [[Fomalhaut]] and [[Vega]], although further away, would appear somewhat displaced as well.  Proxima Centauri would be an inconspicuous 4.5 magnitude star, which considering it would only be a quarter of a [[light-year]] away shows just how dim Proxima really is.

&lt;!--- To compute the following figures, use masses 1.1 and 0.92 Suns, luminosities 1.57 and 0.51 Suns (Sun visual magnitude -26.73), and an orbit of 11.2 to 35.6 AUs; min luminosity adds the planet's orbital radius to the max A-B distance (conjunction), max luminosity subtracts the planet's orbital radius from the min A-B distance (opposition) ---&gt;A hypothetical planet around either &amp;alpha; Centauri A or B would see the other star as a very bright secondary. For example, an Earth-like planet at 1.25 [[Astronomical Unit]]s from &amp;alpha; Cen A (with a revolution period of 1.34 [[year|a]]) would get Sun-like illumination from its primary, and &amp;alpha; Cen B would appear 5.7 to 8.6 magnitudes dimmer (&amp;minus;21.0 to &amp;minus;18.2), 190 to 2700 times dimmer than &amp;alpha; Cen A but still 29 to 9 times brighter than the full Moon. Conversely, an Earth-like planet at 0.71 AUs from &amp;alpha; Cen B (with a revolution period of 0.63 [[year|a]]) would get Sun-like illumination from its primary, and α Cen A would appear 4.6 to 7.3 magnitudes dimmer (&amp;minus;22.1 to &amp;minus;19.4), 70 to 840 times dimmer than &amp;alpha; Cen B but still 45 to 15 times brighter than the full Moon. In both cases the secondary sun would, in the course of the planet's year, appear to circle the sky. It would start off right beside the primary and end up, half a period later, opposite it in the sky (a &quot;midnight sun&quot;). After another half period, it would complete the cycle.  For a hypothetical Earthlike planet around either star, the secondary sun would not be bright enough to adversely affect climate or plant photosynthesis (being as far away as [[Saturn]] is from our [[Sun]]), but would mean that for about half the year, the night sky, instead of a pitch black would appear a dark blue, and one could walk around rather easily without artificial light.

==Apparent movement==
In about 4000 years, the [[proper motion]] of Alpha Centauri will mean that from the point of view of Earth it will appear close enough to [[Beta Centauri]] to form an optical [[double star]]. Beta Centauri is in reality far more distant than Alpha Centauri.
[[Image:Motion-of-Alpha-Cen.jpg|thumb|170px|Apparent motion of Alpha Centauri relative to [[Beta Centauri]].]]

==Alpha Centauri in fiction==
Because of its status as our star's nearest galactic neighbor, Alpha Centauri has frequently been referred to in science fiction stories involving interstellar travel.

In ''[[The Centauri Device]]'' (1975) by [[M. John Harrison]] the native Centaurians (humanoid aliens able to interbreed with humans) have been wiped out in a [[genocidal]] attack by expanding Earth colonisation of the galaxy.  The novel's main character, whose mother was Centauran, is one of the few people in the cosmos able to operate the 'device' of the book's title; a weapon of enormous power.

Alpha Centauri is mentioned at the beginning of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' by [[Douglas Adams]].  Shortly before the [[Vogons]] demolish the Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass, they inform the planet that &quot;All the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display in your local planning department on Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it's far too late to start making a fuss about it now.&quot;  When someone objects to this, [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz|Protstetnic Vogon Jeltz]] replies, &quot;What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? For heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout.&quot;  This scene appears in every incarnation of the story except the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|movie]] version.  The story also mentions that in the old days of the Universe, &quot;men were ''real'' men, women were ''real'' women, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were ''real'' small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri.&quot;

In the ''[[Lost In Space]]'' TV series, Alpha Centauri is the intended destination of the United States spacecraft ''Jupiter 2'' launched [[October 16]], [[1997]] and crewed by the Robinson family and Major Don West. Stowaway Dr. Zachary Smith sabotages the mission on behalf of a foreign government, sending the ship off course.

In the 1991 computer game [[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]] and its sequals, one of the ways to achieve victory is to successfully launch an expidition to colonize Alpha Centauri. &quot;[[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]],&quot; a spiritual sequel, involves seven ideological factions competing to colonize the Earth-like planet Chiron that orbits Alpha Centauri. 

In an episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', [[Zefram Cochrane]], the inventor of the [[warp drive]] is said to be from Alpha Centauri, though there is considerable debate as to whether this was intended to identify his place of origin, or of residence. However, he cannot be from AC, as seen in [[Star Trek: First Contact]], the 8th film in the series, as he is found by the [[Enterprise-E]] crew on Earth in the late 21st century. The novel &quot;Federation&quot; by Garfield and Judith Reeves-Stephens (co-writers on Star Trek: Enterprise), though superceded by the movie First Contact, postulates that Cochrane grew up on Earth, developed warp drive with the backing of Micah Brack, then led the settlement at Alpha Centauri that safeguarded humanity just a few short years later when a terrible war devastated Earth; Cochrane subsequently lived most of his remaining pre-Companion life at Alpha Centauri, thus accounting for his being &quot;of&quot; Alpha Centauri.

In the [[DC Comics]] universe, the planet [[Rann]] originated in the Alpha Centauri system. Rannians are so close to normal Earth-based humans that [[Adam Strange]] was brought to the planet to act as a sort of breeding stud. This was before Rann was teleported out of the Alpha Centauri system, into a parallel [[pocket universe]], and then to the [[Polaris]] system.

In [[James P. Hogan]]'s 1982 [[space opera]] novel [[Voyage from Yesteryear]], a human colony is artificially created at Alpha Centauri by automatic probe.

[[Image:Amiga 1000.jpg|thumb|255px|The original Amiga (1985)]]
The '''Amiga''' is a family of [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]]s originally developed by [[Amiga Corporation]] as an advanced [[game console]].  Development on the Amiga began in [[1982]] with [[Jay Miner]] as the principal hardware designer.  [[Commodore International]] introduced the machine to the market in [[1985]], after having bought Amiga Corp.  The machine was ahead of its time, sporting a [[Original Amiga chipset|custom chipset]] with advanced graphics and sound capabilities, and a sophisticated multitasking [[operating system]], now known as [[AmigaOS]].  Based on the [[Motorola]] [[68k]] series of [[32-bit]] [[microprocessor]]s, the Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers such as the [[Commodore 64]], the Amiga quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts, especially in Europe. It also found a prominent role in the video production business.

==History==
===Amiga Corporation===
The Amiga's chipset was designed by a small company called [[Amiga Corporation]] during the end of the first home video game boom. Wary of industrial espionage, the chipset was codenamed Lorraine during development. Amiga Corp. funded the development of the Lorraine by manufacturing [[joystick]]s while seeking investors. The chipset was to be used in a video game machine, but following the [[video game crash of 1983]], the Lorraine was repurposed to be a personal computer. Before Amiga Corp. could bring the machine to market, the company encountered financial difficulties and was purchased by Commodore in August 1984.

The Amiga was designed to be the ultimate video game machine. Since a video game console requires lots of processing power, memory, CPU bandwidth, audo and video hardware, it can be seen that the relatively small additions of a capable operating system and good keyboard will make a video game console into a highly capable personal computer.

===Commodore===
The first Amiga computer, simply called the Amiga (and conspicuously devoid of references to Commodore), was released in [[1985]] by [[Commodore International|Commodore]], who marketed it both as their intended successor to the [[Commodore 64]] and as their competitor against the [[Atari ST]]. It was later renamed the [[Amiga 1000]] (or A1000 for short). Revolutionary for its time, it could display 4,096 colors and produce 4 channels of 8-bit stereo digital audio. It is also notable for having the first [[Computer multitasking#Preemptive multitasking|preemptive multitasking]] operating system with a color [[GUI]], allowing users to perform multiple tasks at the same time.

[[Image:Amiga500 system1.jpg|thumb|350px|An Amiga 500, with 1084S RGB monitor and A1010 floppy disk drive. (1987)]]

In [[1987]], Commodore released two new Amiga models, the [[A500]] and the [[A2000]]. These were marketed as low-end and high-end machines, respectively. The former became the most popular Amiga computer of the decade and served primarily as a games machine, while the latter was marketed as a more serious workstation for graphic purposes, due to the presence of a [[SCSI]] controller option, a [[Genlock]] slot and a video I/O connector.

In [[1990]], the [[A3000]] was introduced as the successor to both the A1000 and A2000, with an [[Extended chip set|enhanced chipset]] (ECS) and the second release of its operating system, which would eventually be called [[AmigaOS]].

In the same year, Commodore released three new low-end machines: the [[CDTV]], aimed to move the platform to the living room; the [[A500plus|A500+]], with the same enhancements as the A3000; and the [[A600]], basically an A500+ in a smaller box with an [[IDE]] controller for hard disks. All of these were commercial failures, mainly due to poor marketing.

Mass-market Amigas were then considerably cheaper than PCs and Macs at the time. This factor helped to boost sales in the more price-conscious European markets, but it also led to Commodore being viewed in U.S. markets as a producer of cheap &quot;game machines&quot;. This perception was furthered by the fact that most Commodore retail outlets were toy stores, and marketing campaigns were woefully mismatched with the status-conscious American public. Overall, the Amiga was very successful in [[Europe]], but it sold less than a million units in the [[United States|U.S.]].

In [[1992]], Commodore released their last Amiga computer models, the [[A1200]] and the [[A4000]]: Each featured the new [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset and the third release of [[AmigaOS]].

In [[1993]], menaced by console giants [[Sega]] and [[Nintendo]], Commodore marketed the [[Amiga CD32|CD32]] in a desperate attempt to save their business. The CD32 was one of the earliest [[Compact Disc|CD]]-based consoles and was also the world's first 32-bit game machine, with specifications similar to the A1200.

[[Image:Amiga-Computer.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An Amiga A500 computer, photographed in the early [[1990s]].]]

===Bankruptcy===
In [[1994]], Commodore filed for bankruptcy and its assets were purchased by [[Escom]], a German PC manufacturer, who created the [[subsidiary]] company [[Amiga Technologies]]. However, Escom in turn went bankrupt in [[1997]]. The Amiga brand was then sold to another PC manufacturer, [[Gateway 2000]], which had announced grand plans for it. However, in 2000, Gateway dropped the Amiga brand. This is rumored to be due to pressure by [[Microsoft]]; however, the real reason for the sale is unknown.

===Amiga, Inc.===
The current owner of the trademark, [[Amiga, Inc.]], has licensed the rights to make hardware using the Amiga brand to a U.K. computer vendor, [http://www.eyetech.co.uk Eyetech Group, Ltd], which was founded by some former UK employees of [[Commodore International]]. They are currently selling the [[AmigaOne]] via an international dealer network. The AmigaOne is a [[PowerPC]] computer designed to run the last remnants of [[AmigaOS]], which was itself licensed to a Belgian-German company, [http://www.hyperion-entertainment.biz Hyperion Entertainment].

Only a very few Amiga [[Clone (computer science)|clone]]s were ever produced, as both Commodore and subsequent owners of the trademark refused to license the Amiga technology to third-party manufacturers.

Today, Amigas running AmigaOS version 3.9 and earlier are now considered &quot;Classic&quot; Amigas, as opposed to the new Amiga Inc./Eyetech/Hyperion models. Due to its popularity as a gaming platform, many people incorrectly refer to the Amiga as a games console (even though it is a fully-featured computer). However, there are many &quot;Classic&quot; Amigas still in use around the world.  A popular use for the classic Amiga is as an automated readerboard for local community-access TV stations.

==Technical features==
For its time, the Amiga was quite an advanced computer for the home market. It provided impressive sound and graphics for games, and it was also popular in business environments until around the mid-1990s, aiding users in video editing and 3D graphics.

The very first model, the [[Amiga 1000]], had a 7.14 MHz CPU, designed to work directly with [[NTSC]] video. The CPU clock frequency was precisely double the 3.57 MHz color carrier frequency. The A1000 had a built-in composite video output, which allowed the computer to be hooked up directly to a TV or VCR. However, the output signal was considered too &quot;hot&quot; (strong) by many to be useful for anything other than home use (however, this could be remedied by running the A1000's composite output through a video processing amplifier, or &quot;proc amp&quot;, to bring the video levels down to a suitable amount).

The [[Original Amiga chipset]], or OCS, was more advanced than other architectures of its time: it had dedicated chips for real-time video effects, allowing users to easily work with [[genlock]]s to overlay graphics atop live video. The Amiga's unique [[overscan]] feature, the ability to run at custom, user-defined resolutions, allowed it to draw images past the visible borders of a television screen, allowing seamless fly-ins and scrolling from off-frame. Today, many TV stations and broadcast corporations are still using [[A3000]]s and [[A4000]]s for their real-time video effects. Many programs were also written for creating &quot;[[fansub]]s&quot; of foreign films and [[Japanese animation]]. Many competing products were created for the Amiga's video capabilities ranging from simple genlocks that allowed you to simply switch the RGB overlay feed on and off, to more advanced devices like the Supergen which had faders, and the ultimate expression of the Amiga's native power, the Newtek [[Video Toaster]]. Other interesting products that used the genlock capability enabled users to do motion tracking and interactivity, 20 years before similar products like the Sony EyeToy for the Playstation 2 video-game console. 

Due to its ability to genlock, that is, adjust its own screen refresh timing to
match the signal from a VCR, the Amiga also had a niche market among biologists
analyzing video of organisms in motion at a time when other systems capable
of doing similar tasks cost an order of magnitude more.  At the time, several
video boards for IBM-compatible systems could overlay computer-generated graphics
on top of the signal from a video camera, but these boards required the camera
to accept a sync pulse from the computer, so were useless for overlaying graphics
on VCR output.  In the late 1980s the Amiga was for some biologists working
on limited budgets the only affordable way to do kinematic analysis of
video captured by a VCR.

Another unique feature provided by the Amiga was the ability to change display resolutions ''on the fly'' &amp;mdash; the computer could display different scan lines at different resolutions, allowing for multiple screens of information at different resolutions that could overlap one another without interfering with each other.  The chipset also included a [[blitter]], which could copy and manipulate large amounts of graphics data at once (making the Amiga well-suited to arcade action games), and accelerated line-drawing and area-filling functions, which helped advance the popularity of real-time [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] and games.  However, the Amiga would later become disadvantaged with the advent of [[first-person shooter]] games such as the PC game [[Doom]]. This was partly because the Amiga's [[planar]] graphics chipsets were less well suited to this type of 3D graphics, compared to the [[chunky]] graphics chipsets found on PC and [[Macintosh]] computers.

==Operating systems==
[[Image:Amiga_kick34.5_askforwb1.3.png|right|frame|After powering up or rebooting an Amiga 500 this screen display is seen, meaning the OS started and asking the user to insert a bootable floppy disk. The displayed OS is [[Kickstart]] 1.3.]]

The operating system, [[AmigaOS]], was also quite sophisticated for its time, combining an intuitive [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) like that of the [[Apple Macintosh]] together with an elegant [[Command Line Interface]] (CLI) which then eventually evolved into a very powerful Shell. This gives the user of Amiga some of the flexibility of [[Unix|UNIX]] while retaining a simplicity that made maintenance rather easy. While its [[AmigaOS|operating system]] was the only [[preemptive multitasking]] platform with an efficient message-passing kernel in the consumer marketplace for several years with an efficient [[memory management]], [[robustness]] left something to be desired, mainly due to the absence of [[protected memory]], resulting in the famous &quot;[[Guru Meditation]]&quot; errors.

The Amiga operating system was resurrected in [[2000]] as [[AmigaOS#AmigaOS 4|AmigaOS 4]], which currently runs only on [[AmigaOne]] computers and on [[A1200]]s and [[A4000]]s with a [[PowerPC]] accelerator card.

Other, still maintained, operating systems are available for the classic Amiga platform, including [[Linux]] and [[NetBSD]]. Older versions of [[OpenBSD]] can also be run - the last Amiga release was 3.2. [[Commodore Amiga Unix]] (based on AT&amp;T System V Rel. 4) was available only for the [[A2500]] and [[A3000]].

===MS-DOS on Amiga via Sidecar or Bridgeboard===
[[MS-DOS]] compatibility was a major issue during the early years of the Amiga's lifespan in order to promote the machine as a serious business machine. In order to run the MS-DOS operating system, Commodore released the 'Sidecar' for Amiga 1000, basically a [[8086]] board in a closed case that connected to the side of the Amiga. Clever programming (a library named Janus, after the two-faced [[Janus (mythology)|Roman god]] of doorways) made it possible to run PC software in an Amiga window without use of [[emulation]]. At the introduction of the Sidecar the crowd was stunned to see the MS-DOS version of ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'' running at full speed in an Amiga window on the [[AmigaOS#workbench|Workbench]].

Later the Sidecar was implemented on an expansion card named 'Bridgeboard' for Amiga 2000+ models. Bridgeboard cards appeared up to [[Intel 80486|486 processor]] variants. The Bridgeboard card and the Janus library made the use of PC expansion cards and harddisk/floppydisk drives possible. The bridgeboard card was manufactured by Commodore, later third party cards also appeared for the A500/1200 expansion slot such as the KCS Powerboard.

Eventually, full-software emulators, such as PC-Task allowed Amigas to run MS-DOS programs, including Microsoft Windows, without additional hardware, at the costs of speed and compatibility.

===Mac OS on Amiga===
Also introduced for the Amiga were two products, A-Max (both internal and external models)and the Emplant expansion card. Both allowed the Amiga to emulate an [[Apple Macintosh]] and run the [[Mac OS|Macintosh Operating System]] using the process of [[Translation emulation|translation emulation]]. It required an Apple Macintosh ROM image, or actual ROMs in the case of A-Max, which needed to be obtained from a real Macintosh. The user needed to own the real Macintosh or Mac ROMs to legally run the emulator.

In 1988 the first Apple Mac emulator,A-Max, was released as an external device for any Amiga. It needed Mac ROMs to function, and could read Mac disks when used with a Mac floppy drive (Amiga floppy drives are unable to read Mac disks. Unlike Amiga disks Mac floppy disks spin at variable speeds, much like CD ROM drives). It wasn't a particularly elegant solution, but it did provide an affordable and usable Mac experience.  

ReadySoft, makers of A-Max, followed up with A-Max II in the early '90s.  A-Max II was contained on a zorro compatible card and allowed the user, again using actual Mac roms, to emulate a color Macintosh.  In fact, an Amiga 3000 emulating a Mac via A-Max II was significantly faster than the first consumer color Mac, the LC.

Over time full-software emulation was available, but you still had to get a ROM image. Example emulators include [[ShapeShifter (emulator)|ShapeShifter]] (not to be confused with the third party preference pane [[ShapeShifter]]), later superseded by [[Basilisk II]] (both by the same programmer who conceived [[SheepShaver]], [[Christian Bauer]]), Fusion and iFusion (the latter ran classic MacOS using translation emulation with a [[PowerPC]] &quot;coprocessor&quot; accelerator card). 

This form of emulation has been said to equal or better the speed of a Macintosh with the same processor, especialy with respect to the m68k series due to real Macs running in [[Memory management unit|MMU]] trap mode, hampering performance. Moreover, in the period when no new 68k Mac models were being developed and the majority of Mac software was not natively available on PowerPC Macintosh yet (but only runnable through a slow 68k emulation), the fastest &quot;Macintosh&quot; machines around were actually by far Amiga computers with [[68060]] CPUs running ShapeShifter or Fusion.

One should note that although Amigas were very successful at emulating Macintoshes, it was never considered to be a [[Macintosh clone]] as it could not use MacOS as a primary operating system.

==Third party hardware==
Many expansion boards were produced for Amigas to improve the performance and capability of the hardware, such as memory expansions, SCSI controllers, CPU boards, graphics boards; famous hardware manufacturers were Great Valley Products (GVP) and [[Phase5]]. In addition to expansion boards with 68060 CPUs, Phase5 also designed the PowerUp boards (BlizzardPPC and CyberstormPPC) featuring both a 68k and a PPC CPU, which were able to run the two CPUs at the same time (and shared the system memory). The PPC CPU on PowerUp boards was usually used as a coprocessor for heavy computations (a powerful CPU was needed to run for example MAME, but even decoding JPEG pictures and MP3 audio was considered heavy computation in those years). It was also possible to ignore the 68k CPU and run Linux on the PPC (project Linux APUS), but a PPC native Amiga OS was not available when the PPC boards appeared.

==Third party software==
Amiga was originally supported by such prestigious software titles as [[WordPerfect]], Electronic Arts' [[Deluxe Paint]], and [[Lattice C]]. Newtek's [[Video Toaster]], one of the first all-in-one graphics and video editing packages, began on the Amiga. The Video Toaster was one of the few accessories for the &quot;big box&quot; Amigas (2000, 3000 and 4000) that used the video slot, and enabled users to turn their Amiga into the heart of an entire TV Production suite. The later addition of the Video Flyer by Newtek made possible the first non-linear video editing program for the Amiga. The Amiga made 3D [[raytrace|raytracing]] graphics available for the masses with [[Sculpt 3D]] (before the Amiga, raytracing was only available for dedicated graphic workstations). The Amiga was well known for its 3D rendering capability, with many titles being added to the mix as the years went by. Some titles were later ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] and continue to thrive there, such as the rendering software [[Cinema 4D]] from Maxon, and [[LightWave]] from Newtek, which was originally part of the [[Video Toaster]]. The [[Video Toaster]] itself has even been ported to the Windows platform. Even [[Microsoft]] produced software for use on the Amiga. [[AmigaBASIC]], an advanced [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] software development environment, complete with an Interactive Development Environment (IDE), was written by Microsoft under contract.

[[Richmond Sound Design]] (RSD) created both [[show control]] and theatre [[sound design]] software which was used extensively in the theatre, theme park, display, exhibit, show and themed entertainment industries in the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]] and at one point in the mid 90s, there were many high profile shows at major theme parks around the world being controlled by Amigas.  There were dozens at [[Walt Disney World]] alone and more at all other [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Universal Studios]], [[Six Flags]] and [[Madame Tussauds]] properties as well as in many venues in Las Vegas including [[The Mirage]] hotel Volcano, the [[MGM Grand]] [[EFX]] show, [[Broadway theatre]], London's [[West End]], the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s many venues, most of [[Branson, Missouri]]'s theatres, and scores of theatres on cruise ships, amongst hundreds of others.  RSD purchased used Amigas on the web and reconditioned them to provide enough systems for all the shows that specified them and only stopped providing new Amiga installations in 2000. There are still an unknown number of shows on cruise ships and in themed venues being run by Amigas.

Much shareware and free software was written for the Amiga and could be obtained via the [[Fred Fish]] disk series or from the [[Aminet]] software archive.

==Amiga Emulators==
Many Amiga users actually use a system that boots directly into the emulator.

There is the [[Unix Amiga Emulator]] (UAE) that can emulate a full system on Macintosh and Intel systems, including undocumented behavior and the custom chips. Also there is a special Windows port, WinUAE.

There is a commercial product [[Amiga Forever]] that includes an emulator and the AmigaOS as well as several other important parts.

Another emulator is [[Fellow (computing)|Fellow]].

==User Base==
The Amiga was considered by some to have had an extraordinarily loyal fan base. When Commodore went bankrupt in 1994, there was still a very active Amiga community, and this continued to support the platform long after mainstream commercial vendors abandoned the platform.  There were many fans who believed that the Amiga was unique and was better than other platforms - some still exist to this day using the AmigaOne (manufactured by UK firm Eyetech), despite utilising slower hardware compared to a PC of the same price.

One reason for this loyalty was due to the strengths of the machine at the time: it had a stable, compact, efficient, multitasking OS, it was relatively easy to program for, software had relatively easy access to the hardware (the base hardware was fixed so software could be coded specifically to the hardware), there was a wealth quality software, and it was an affordable multimedia machine for its time.  

However as time wore on, the hardware was overtaken and as the PC improved in software and hardware the Amiga started to look dated.  Despite this, its solid userbase continued to produce software and get as much as they possibly could out of the machine. Amiga users managed to squeeze every drop of performance and capability out of the machines, with software and hardware expansions to enhance its capabilities.  Even today there is enough demand for expansion hardware to keep some small scale manufacturers in business.

==Models and variants==
Amigas fall into several categories, Classic models, such as the 1200 and the 4000, PPC based models such as the AmigaOne, and unoffocial models. Amigas were first produced in 1985, and continue to be produced.

:''Main article: [[Amiga models and variants]]''

==Trivia==
* The name ''amiga'' is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for 'female friend', from the [[Latin]] ''amica''.
* The Amiga [[as of 2006|still]] has a very strong user community, particularly outside the United States.
* The Amiga community made a significant contribution to a computer subculture known as the [[Demoscene]]. The Demoscene was more or less a phenomenon inherited from [[Commodore 64]] times.
* Much [[operating system advocacy]] surrounded the technology implemented in the Amiga. This led some to accuse Amiga users of [[computer zealotry|zealotry]] (look for &quot;Amiga Persecution Complex&quot; in the [[Jargon File]]).
* Amiga has two [[Three-finger salute (computing)|Three-finger salute]]s, one for warm reset (CTRL plus the two &quot;Amiga&quot; keys) and the other for reboot (CTRL plus the two &quot;Alt&quot; keys). The latter method was introduced with AmigaOS 4.0.
* When an Amiga crashes, it displays a flashing red box with a mysterious [[Guru Meditation]] number. The number is actually the 68000 exception number, and some other piece of information, such as the address (in hexadecimal) of the task that caused the crash.
* During the Commodore era, machines with 'thousands' model numbering were marketed as 'quality' machines for business use, while the other machines (A500, A500+, A600, A1200) were 'consumer' machines.
* The three most popular low-end models of the Amiga - the 500, 600 and 1200 - each had the name of a [[The B-52's|B-52's]] song written on their [[motherboard]]. The most widely cited reason for this is the designers having been fans of the band. The motherboard of the 500 says &quot;[[Rock Lobster]]&quot;, that of the 600 says &quot;[[June Bug (song)|June Bug]]&quot; and that of the 1200 says &quot;[[Channel Z]]&quot;. No other models have song names on their motherboards.
* The Amiga 600 was originally supposed to be the Amiga 300, a very low-cost &quot;introductory&quot; model, but in an attempt to cut costs plans from CBM management changed at the last minute, and it was instead marketed as the successor to the 500 and the 500+. The motherboard of the Amiga 600 still says &quot;Amiga 300&quot;.
* A common misconception is that before Amiga was sold to Commodore, [[Atari]] was in the running for purchasing the small, [[Los Gatos]]-based company. The misconception further states that after Atari lost the acquisition, it developed the Atari ST to compete with the (then) &quot;Commodore&quot; Amiga.&lt;br/&gt;The truth is that it was Warner's Atari Inc. that had made a deal with Amiga back in 1983 (which can be seen [http://www.atarimuseum.com/articles/mickey.html here]) and not Tramiel's Atari Corp. (which developed the ST). The agreement basically gave Atari Inc. access to the Amiga hardware for their own computer system codenamed &quot;Mickey&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;As part of the agreement, Atari would sell &quot;Mickey&quot; (formally the [[Atari 1850XLD]]) as a video game system with no keyboard for 1 year. After that, Atari could then sell a keyboard add-on and sell full blown versions of &quot;Mickey&quot; to the public. Work was started but Atari ran in to the well known financial troubles and Warner wound up breaking up and selling off the parts of Atari Inc.&lt;br/&gt;The consumer division (which included consoles and computers) was sold to former Commodore founder Jack Tramiel. Jack had left Commodore in [[January 1984]] and after taking a short vacation decided to return to the business with his own next generation low cost computer system. So he formed [[Tramiel Technology, Ltd.]] (TTL) with some former Commodore employees and designed what would become known as the ST series of computers. In late [[May 1984]] he purchased Atari Consumer for their manufacturing capabilities and distribution network, which he'd need to manufacture and sell his new computer.&lt;br/&gt;The takeover was completed on [[July 2]]nd, and the truth of the matter is that the ST was 90% finished by the time this occurred. The operating system being the only major work needed to be finished. 

Jack and his people had '''no''' idea about the Amiga agreement at the time. When they took over Atari Consumer and formed Atari Corp., all projects were put on hold until they could evaluate them. In the meantime, more engineering and management left Commodore to join up at Jack's new Atari Corp. Within the span of a few weeks, several major occurrences happened.
# In late July, Commodore filed suit against Jack for stealing trade secrets because of this influx of former Commodore employees.
# Commodore bought Amiga.
# During the project evaluations, the Tramiel's discovered Atari Inc.'s previous agreement with Amiga and used it to launch a countersuit against Commodore via Amiga on [[August 13]]th.&lt;br/&gt;All suits were eventually dropped and/or settled out of court.
* [[Steve Jobs]] was shown the original prototype for the first Amiga (Amiga 1000) before it had been purchased by Commodore, and said there was &quot;too much hardware&quot;. He was working on [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] at the time.
* Two of the designers of the original Amiga, [[RJ Mical]] and [[Dave Needle]], would later go on to design the [[Atari Lynx]], giving it a framebuffer based display with a blitter very similar to that in the Amiga. The two would also go on to work on the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]].
* When [[Great Valley Products]] first released their [[68030]] accelerator board for the Amiga 2000, it ran Apple's MacOS faster than any real Mac. Apple soon caught up, though.

[[Image:Asbestos2USGOV.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Asbestos]]
[[Image:Asbestos3USGOV.jpg|thumb|200px|Asbestos]]

'''Asbestos''' (a misapplication of [[Latin]]: ''asbestos'' &quot;[[quicklime]]&quot; from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄσβεστος: a-, &quot;not&quot;; sbestos, &quot;extinguishable&quot;) describes any of a group of fibrous [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic mineral]]s of the [[hydrous]] [[magnesium]] [[silicate]] variety. The name is derived for its historical use in lamp wicks; the resistance of asbestos to fire has long been exploited for a variety of purposes. It was used in fabrics such as [[Egypt]]ian burial cloths and [[Charlemagne]]'s tablecloth, which, according to legend, he threw in a fire to clean. Asbestos occurs naturally in many forms (see below); it is mined from metamorphic deposits.

When asbestos is used for its resistance to fire or heat, the fibers are typically mixed with [[cement]] or woven into fabric or mats.  It is used in [[brake]] shoes and [[gasket]]s for its heat resistance, and in the past was used on electric oven and hotplate wiring for its electrical insulation at elevated temperature, and in buildings for its flame-retardant and insulating properties, its [[tensile strength]], flexibility, and resistance to chemicals. However, the [[inhalation]] of some kinds of asbestos fibers causes various serious illnesses, including [[cancer]], and thus most uses of asbestos are banned in many countries.  [[Fiberglass]] has been found to be a suitable substitute for thermal insulation and woven [[ceramic]] fiber performs as well or better as an insulator of high-temperature electrical conductors. 

Most respirable asbestos fibers are invisible to the unaided human eye because their size is about 3.0-20.0 [[Micrometre|µm]] in length and can be as thin as 0.01 µm. Human hair ranges in size from 17 to 181 µm.[http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/BrianLey.shtml] Fibers ultimately form because when these minerals originally cooled and crystallized, they formed by the [[polymer]]ic molecules lining up parallel with each other and forming oriented [[crystal structure|crystal lattices]].  These crystals thus have three cleavage planes as other minerals and gemstones have.  But in their case, there are two cleavage planes that are much weaker than the third direction.  Thus when sufficient force is applied they tend to break along their weakest directions, resulting in a linear fragmentation pattern and hence a fibrous form.  This fracture process can keep occurring over and over until they have been broken down to their smallest unit dimensions.  For this reason, one larger asbestos fiber can ultimately become the source of hundreds of much thinner and smaller fibers in a normal environment over the course of time.  As they get smaller and lighter, they become more mobile and more easily entrained (wafted) into the air, where human respiratory exposures typically result.

Confusingly, the [[Modern Greek]] word ''άσβεστος'' means ''[[calcium oxide|quicklime]]''.

==Types of asbestos==
[[Image:Asbestos1USGOV.jpg|thumb|200px|Chrysotile asbestos]]
[[Image:Asbestos fibres.jpg|thumb|200px|Asbestos fibres]] 
*[[Chrysotile]], or ''white asbestos'', [[CAS registry number|CAS No.]] 12001-29-5, is obtained from Canadian [[serpentine]] rocks.  It is less [[friability|friable]] (and therefore less likely to be inhaled) than the other types and is the type most often used industrially. Chrysotile should not be confused with [[chrysolite]], a synonym of [[olivine]]. There is some evidence that this form of asbestos is not actually harmful when inhaled. However it should be noted that there is also evidence that this type of asbestos is harmful, although not perhaps as harmful as other forms (refer to UK Health &amp; Safety Commission report ''Asbestos: Effects on health of exposure to asbestos'', 1985). One formula given for Chrysotile is Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

*[[Amosite]], CAS No. 12172-73-5, also known as ''Grunerite'' or ''brown asbestos'', is an amphibole from [[Africa]], named as an [[acronym]] from Asbestos Mines of South Africa. One formula given for Amosite is Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

*[[Crocidolite]], or ''blue asbestos'', CAS No. 12001-28-4, is an amphibole from Africa and [[Australia]].  It is the fibrous form of [[riebeckite]]. Blue asbestos is commonly thought of as the most dangerous type of asbestos (see above and below). One formula given for Crocidolite is Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Notes: Serpentine rocks are those with curled fibres. [[Amphibole]]s have straight, needle-like fibres.

The amphiboles, in their fibrous form, are [[friability|friable]] and therefore the most carcinogenic, although they also exist in safer non-fibrous forms. Asbestos with particularly fine fibers is also referred to as &quot;amianthus&quot;.

Other asbestos minerals, such as [[tremolite]], CAS No. 77536-68-6, Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; [[actinolite]] (or ''smaragdite''), CAS No. 77536-66-4, Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Mg, Fe)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; and [[anthophyllite]], CAS No. 77536-67-5, (Mg, Fe)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; are less-used industrially but can still be found in a variety of construction materials and insulations and occur in a few consumer products, such as talcum powders and vermiculite.  In the United States, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has banned all construction-related products that have asbestos content of 1% or greater.  It has also banned asbestos in all other friable (easily crushed by finger pressure) products.

==Uses==

===Historic usage===
Items made of asbestos were held in so great an esteem as to be of equal value with gold; none but emperors and kings had napkins made of it. Some antiquaries have believed that ancients made shrouds of asbestos, wherein they burnt the bodies of their kings, in order to entirely preserve their ashes, and prevent their being mixed with those of wood, or other combustible materials commonly used in building funeral piles.{{ref label|1728|1|^}}

Others assert that the ancients used asbestos to make perpetual wicks for sepulchral lamps. In more recent centuries, asbestos was indeed used for this purpose. Although asbestos causes skin to itch upon contact, ancient literature indicates that it was prescribed for diseases of the skin, and particularly for the itch. It is possible that they used the term ''asbestos'' for [[alumen plumosum]], because the two terms have often been confused throughout history.{{ref label|1728|1|^}}

===Modern usage===
====Serpentine group====
Chrysotile is the form of asbestos from the serpentine group that has been used commercially.

In the [[United States]], chrysotile has been the most commonly used type of asbestos.  Chrysotile is often present in a wide variety of materials, including but not limited to: 
* sheetrock taping 
* mud and texture coats
* vinyl floor tiles, sheeting, adhesives and ceiling tiles
* plasters and stuccos
* roofing tars, felts, and shingles
* &quot;transite&quot; panels, siding, countertops, and pipes
* acoustical ceilings
* [[fireproofing]]
* putty
* caulk
* [[gasket]]s
* [[brake]] pads and shoes
* [[clutch]] plates
* stage curtains
* fire blankets

====Amphibole group====
Amosite and crocidolite were used in many products until the early [[1980s]]. The use of all types of asbestos in the amphibole group was banned in the mid-1980s. These products were mainly:
*Low density insulation board and ceiling tiles 
*asbestos cement sheets and pipes for construction, casing for water and electrical/telecommunication services
*thermal and chemical insulation (''i.e.'', fire rated doors, limpet spray, lagging and gaskets)

==Asbestos-related diseases==
===Asbestosis and cancer===
[[Image:Asbestos lungs.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Asbestos particles lodged in the lungs.]]
Strong concerns about the health hazards associated with asbestos had been described many times over the years. As early as [[1898]] the Chief Inspector of Factories of the United Kingdom reported to Parliament in his Annual Report about the &quot;evil effects of asbestos dust&quot;. He reported the &quot;sharp, glass like nature of the particles&quot; when allowed to remain in the air in any quantity, &quot;have been found to be injurious, as might have been expected&quot; (Report of the Select Committee [[1994]]). In [[1906]] a British Parliamentary Commission confirmed the first cases of asbestos [[death]]s in factories in Britain and recommended better ventilation and other safety measures. In [[1918]] a US insurance company produced a study showing premature deaths in the asbestos industry in the United States and in [[1926]] the Massachusetts Industrial Accidents Board processed the first successful compensation claim by a sick asbestos worker.  Many American injuries from asbestos exposure came from shipbuilders working during [[World War II]].[http://www.actuary.org/pdf/casualty/mono_dec01asbestos.pdf]

The fine asbestos fibres are easily inhaled, and can cause a number of respiratory complaints, including a potentially serious lung fibrosis called ''[[asbestosis]]''.  Exposure to asbestos has also been determined to cause a very serious form of [[cancer]], [[mesothelioma]], that occurs in the chest and abdominal cavities.  This aggressive disease is improperly referred to as a [[lung]] [[cancer]], as the malignant cells are derived from the [[mesothelium]], a tissue found on the inner walls of the chest and abdominal cavities and on the outer surface of the lungs rather than in the lung itself.

When inhaled, asbestos is [[carcinogen]]ic (i.e. promotes [[cancer]]). In the [[United States]] alone, it is estimated that ten thousand people die each year of asbestos-related diseases, such as mesothelioma, asbestosis, [[lung cancer]], and gastrointestinal cancer.  Asbestos has a synergistic effect with [[tobacco smoking]] in the causation of lung cancer.

===Other asbestos-related diseases===
*''asbestos warts'' &amp;#8211; caused when the sharp fibres lodge in the [[skin]] and are overgrown causing benign [[callus]]-like growths.

*''pleural plaques'' &amp;#8211; discrete fibrous or partially calcified thickened area which can be seen on [[X-ray]]s of individuals exposed to asbestos.  They do not become malignant nor normally cause any lung impairment.

*''diffuse pleural thickening'' &amp;#8211; similar to above and can sometimes be associated with asbestosis.  Usually no symptoms shown but if extensive can cause [[lung]] impairment.

==Litigation==
{{main|Asbestos and the law}}
In the United States, asbestos was one of the first hazardous air [[pollutant]]s regulated under Section 112 of the [[Clean Air Act (USA) (1970)|Clean Air Act]] of [[1970]].  One estimate says that, in the 20th century, more than 100 million Americans were exposed to asbestos in the workplace.[http://www.actuary.org/pdf/casualty/mono_dec01asbestos.pdf]

Today, lawsuits claiming that asbestos caused plaintiffs' diseases form a gigantic part of the total amount of lawsuits pending in American courts, with a cost of tens of billions of dollars for expenses, settlements, and judgments to date. The original asbestos manufacturers were driven into [[Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]]; plaintiffs have moved to suing corporations who had more peripheral connections to asbestos; the original plaintiffs have gone from those who had mesothelioma and other serious asbestos-related health problems to include those who merely were exposed to asbestos and wished to recover for their fear of future injury.[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1032128856491]  Nearly every American industry has had asbestos defendants, and over 70 corporations have filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the face of heavy liability claims.[http://www.actuary.org/pdf/casualty/mono_dec01asbestos.pdf], [http://www.asbestossolution.org/bankruptcies.doc]  Since the late 1970s, approximately 6% of all filings in American courts each year were related to asbestos, leading to its perception as a sort of [[poster child]] of [[tort reform]] and the rampant lawsuit excesses of the United States.  A [[RAND]] [http://www.rand.org/publications/MG/MG162/ study] found that less than half the money spent on asbestos litigation went to injured parties, as opposed to attorneys' fees and administrative costs.  [[As of 2004]], asbestos cases result in about 600 to 700 appellate opinions per year (that is, including both federal and state courts); this number does not include other cases that were not appealed, or were settled or otherwise abandoned before trial.  Estimates of total American deaths attributable to asbestos range from 200,000 to 265,000 (according to the March 1991 Report of the Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on Asbestos Litigation). The number of suits has increased, although the leading epidemiological study, cited by attorneys on both sides, suggests that deaths peaked in the 1990s. However, others contend that deaths from asbestosis and mesothelioma have not yet peaked.[http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/facts/fact1.php]

&quot;Asbestos litigation today is, for the most part, a massively fraudulent enterprise that can rightfully take its place among the pantheon of such great American swindles as the [[Yazoo land scandal|Yazoo land frauds]], [[Credit Mobilier]] and [[Teapot Dome]],&quot; said [[Lester Brickman]], a professor at [[Cardozo Law School]], in a recent speech on the phenomenon.[http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cjf_40.htm]  For example, [[Fred Baron|Baron &amp; Budd, P.C.]], a renowned [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] plaintiff's firm, is alleged to have coached clients how to provide winning testimony against asbestos defendants.[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/T?&amp;report=sr118&amp;dbname=cp108]  In recent years, there have been many scandals over asbestos litigation because of the number of cases involving [[plaintiff]]s who had suffered no injury other than asymptomatic pleural plaques.  An investigation into claims filed for alleged [[silicosis]] found that 65% of the plaintiffs claiming to be suffering from silicosis had previously recovered from asbestos defendants by alleging that they had [[asbestosis]].[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/09/business/09tort.html?pagewanted=all], [http://www.caller2.com/2005/pics/PTO29jurisdiction.pdf]  Many attorneys, including [[Peter Angelos]], have become rich because they established lucrative relationships with unions that steered potential asbestos plaintiffs to their law firms in exchange for questionable financial relationships with union executives.[http://www.pointoflaw.com/articles/26WMEL.pdf], [http://www.motherjones.com/news/special_reports/mojo_400/7_angelos.html] In the mass screenings that would take place, it is alleged that asbestos-related ailments were systematically overdiagnosed.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=490682]

Because many companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in view of claims from plaintiffs (some of whom may have been uninjured), and because some of the earlier manufacturer bankruptcy proceedings underestimated future asbestos liability, many seriously injured workers received as little as ten cents on the dollar of the compensation due them.[http://www.shb.com/FileUploads/elephantinemass_725.pdf], [http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=article&amp;DocID=278]

Asbestos-related cases were a rare sight on the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] [[docket]] prior to 1980, but since then, the Court has dealt with asbestos-injury cases in 1986, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2002.  The 1997 and 1999 cases both involved giant settlement [[class action]]s that were designed to stabilize the liability of the largest defendants. Both settlements were ultimately overturned by the Court because they resolved the rights of future claimants who, because they were currently unknown, could not be given the notice that [[due process]] requires. 

[[Texas]] passed a reform bill requiring neutral medical screening in asbestos claims. Georgia passed a reform bill that requires an out-of-state plaintiff to provide &quot;prima facie evidence of physical impairment&quot; that shows &quot;to a reasonable degree of certainty&quot; that exposure to asbestos was &quot;a substantial contributing factor&quot; to the plaintiff's injuries. Plaintiffs' attorneys in the state complain that this would foreclose &quot;98%&quot; of the pending claims, and that the law is unconstitutional.[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1127133334895] 

Congress is considering legislation, the [[Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005]], that would establish a $140 billion trust fund to supplant litigation as a means to compensate victims of asbestos.  Trial lawyers protest that the trust fund would undercompensate injured workers, while some [[conservative]]s argue that the trust fund does not do enough to prevent fraud; would override state reforms in Texas, Ohio, and Georgia; and would be too &quot;leaky&quot; to prevent future litigation problems.

Asbestos liability is one of the largest issues facing the global insurance industry today, with the industry contending that many are suing because they have been exposed but have not as yet contracted asbestos-related lung diseases, which have latency periods of 10-40 years, and because lawyers spend millions each year advertising to promote such lawsuits.[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1032128833445], [http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1032128856491], [http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/nj/taylor2002-10-01.htm]

In [[Australia]], public attention was drawn in mid-2004 to [[James Hardie]]'s handling of its asbestos injury liabilities, following the revelations of a [[New South Wales]] government-sanctioned inquiry.

In [[Brazil]], prohibition of extraction and use of asbestos is currently under consideration.

In [[Japan]] too, recently there has been a spurt of lawsuits involving actual or potential damage due to the use of asbestos in schools and public places, following public outcry over asbestos-related deaths.

==Removal of asbestos==
[[Image:Asbestos-warning.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Structures containing asbestos are marked]]
Many buildings contain asbestos, which was used in spray-applied [[flame retardant]], thermal system insulation, and in a variety of other materials. Typically, asbestos was &quot;[[Flocking_(texture)|flocked]]&quot; above false ceilings, inside technical ducts, and in many other small spaces where firefighters would have difficulty gaining access. Structural components like asbestos panels were also used.  In residences, it was often a component of a type of flocked acoustic ceiling called &quot;popcorn ceiling&quot;, until its production was banned in the U.S. in 1978.  However, the ban allowed installers to use up remaining stocks, so houses built as late as 1986 could still have asbestos in their acoustic ceilings.  The only way to be sure is to remove a sample and have it tested by a competent laboratory.

Depending on how and where asbestos was applied, it might not pose any risk to most users of the building.  If the fibers cannot dislodge themselves, they cannot be inhaled, and thus the risk is absent. 

However, with certain ways of applying asbestos, particularly flocking, asbestos fibers may gradually drop off into the air. Furthermore, in all cases, asbestos poses special hazards to maintenance personnel who have to drill holes in walls for installation of cables or pipes. 

Also, even if the workers are protected, such maintenance operation may release fibers into the air, which may be inhaled by other users later. As a consequence, interventions in areas where asbestos is present often have to follow stringent procedures.

The removal of asbestos from a building is quite difficult because of the above constraints. If removal is to be performed when users are still present in the building, it is usually necessary to relocate some of them temporarily.  Typically, the part of the building from which asbestos is being removed has to be sealed off in order to prevent contamination of the other areas. 

Even if the building is closed to normal users, it is necessary to seal it off from outside atmosphere so that no accessible air is contaminated. Accordingly, asbestos removal projects are long and costly. Examples of long asbestos removal enterprises include the [[Jussieu Campus]] (begun circa 1996 and still going on [[as of 2005]]) and the ''[[Tour Montparnasse]]'' (in 2005, projected duration was 3 years if the tower was emptied of its users, and 10 years if it was not).

An asbestos-containing building that is to be torn down may have to be sealed, and to have its asbestos safely removed first before ordinary demolition can be performed.  The asbestos removal may take longer and cost more than the actual tearing-down of the building.

== Controversy == 

As with some other environmental prohibitions like [[DDT]] and [[CFC]]s, the movement to ban asbestos has many critics, some of whom claim either that the substance in question is not harmful, or that the ban does more harm than good [http://spiderjohnson.com/asbestos.html]. 

Among the arguments around asbestos prohibition are:

* The view that the [[shuttle Challenger]] exploded because the maker of O-ring putty was pressured by the EPA into ceasing production of its more temperature-resistant, asbestos-laden putty, prompting replacement with an inferior putty, which had continual problems of a sort which could have caused the O-ring leak and subsequent explosion.

* The &quot;Amphibole Hypothesis&quot; states that Chrysotile asbestos is not as harmful as asbestos from the amphibole group.  Several studies have been conducted which support this conclusion.  Criticisms have been raised about the methodology used in these studies.  Several other studies have been conducted which contradict the &quot;Amphibole Hypothesis&quot; [http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-162-d.pdf].

* Some countries, notably Canada, still use Chrysotile asbestos [http://www.chrysotile.com/en/chrysotile/regulation/qc-gov.aspx].  Canada has a significant economic interest in the mining of Chrysotile.

* The question of why asbestos is also banned in circumstances where inhalation is nearly impossible, such as when it's being included in sealed areas already dangerous to human beings, instead of simply when it might be used as insulation in a ventilated area, or other similar cases which actually expose it to people against their will.

* Critics argue that where asbestos has been banned, its roles were taken by products which are often either inferior, or far more expensive. They argue that this has a negative impact on society as a whole, which (especially if the previous arguments are true in whole or part) may be greater than the benefit of its removal.

'''Absorption''' may refer to:

*In physics:
**[[absorption (chemistry)]] - absorption of particles of gas or liquid in liquid or solid material as studied in [[physical chemistry]]
**[[absorption (optics)]] - absorption of [[photon]]s by a material
**[[Absorption (acoustics)]] - absorption of [[sound]] waves by a material
*[[Absorption (economics)]] refers to the total demand of an economy for goods and services both from within and without the economy
*In mathematics, the [[absorption law]] (&lt;math&gt;a\vee (a\wedge b)=a\wedge (a\vee b)=a&lt;/math&gt;) defines a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], where the binary operations &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; are called [[meet]] and [[join]], respectively.

*In Psychology, absorption is a measure of one's capacity to become totally focussed. Total absorption is often termed '[[Flow (psychology)]]'. The Tellegen Absorption Scale is a reliable questionnaire measure of absorption.

*In Medicine/Biology, adsorption may refer to uptake of substances by the [[GI tract]], see [[Digestion]]. Also see [[Osmosis]].

Absorption should not be confused with ''[[adsorption]]'', the formation of a liquid or gas film on a solid surface.

The '''actinophryids''' are a small, familiar group of [[heliozoa]]n protists.  They are the most common heliozoa in fresh water, and are especially frequent in lakes and rivers, but a few are found in marine and soil habitats as well.  Each is unicellular and roughly spherical in shape, without any shell or test, and with many pseudopodia suported by axopods radiating outward from the cell body, which adhere to passing prey and allows it to roll or float about.  The outer portion of the cell, or ectoplasm, is distinct and is filled with many tiny [[vacuole]]s, which assist in flotation.  A few contractile vacuoles around the periphery of the cell expel excess water, and are visible as clear bulges when full.

There are two genera included here.  ''Actinophrys'' have a single, central nucleus.  Most are around [[1 E-5 m|40-50]] &amp;mu;m in diameter, with axopods up to 100 &amp;mu;m in length, though this varies.  ''Actinosphaerium'' are several times larger, from [[1 E-4 m|200-1000]] &amp;mu;m in diameter, with many nuclei, and are found exclusively in fresh water.  Two other genera, ''Echinosphaerium'' and ''Camptonema'', have been described but appear to be synonyms.

Reproduction takes place by fission, with open [[mitosis]].  Under unfavourable conditions, the organism will form a cyst, which is multi-walled and covered in spikes.  While encysted it may undergo a peculiar process of [[autogamy]] or self-fertilization, where it goes through [[meiosis]] and divides to form two gametes, which then fuse together again.  This is the only form of [[sexual reproduction]]  that occurs within the group, though it is really more genetic reorganization than reproduction.

The axopods are supported by [[microtubule]]s arranged in a unique and characteristic double-coil pattern.  In ''Actinophrys'', these arise from the nuclear membrane, while in ''Actinosphaerium'' some do and others don't.  Other heliozoa where the microtubules arise from the nucleus have been considered possible relatives, and it now appears that the actinophryids developed from [[axodine]]s such as ''Pedinella''.  These are specialized [[heterokont]] algae, related to [[golden alga]]e, [[diatom]]s, [[brown alga]]e, and the like, which have microtubule-supported tentacles.
[[Category:Heterokonts]][[Category:Amoeboids]]

As far as the diet of the Actinophyrys goes, the protist feeds on small flagellates, diminutive cilates, microscopic algae, etc.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AbelTasman.jpeg|thumb|250px|Portrait of Tasman]]
'''Abel Janszoon Tasman''' ([[1603]] - [[October 10]], [[1659]]), was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[sea explorer|seafarer]] and [[exploration|explorer]], born in [[Lutjegast]], a village in the province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], best known for his voyages of [[1642]] and [[1644]], in the service of the VOC ([[Dutch East India Company]]). His was the first European [[expedition]] to reach the islands of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) and [[New Zealand]] and the first to sight the [[Fiji]] islands, in 1643. He also mapped substantial portions of [[Australia]].

His task was to investigate the country then known as ''[[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]'', now known as ''Australia'', of which the Dutch had already discovered the west coast, and to determine whether it was part of [[Terra Australis]]. It was hoped by the VOC that he would thus locate a new unexploited continent for [[trade]]. To do so, on his first voyage (1642 to [[1643]]) he sailed from [[Jakarta]] (then known as [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]) with two small ships, the ''Heemskerck'' and the ''Zeehaen'', first to [[Mauritius]], and from there sailed east at a higher latitude than the Dutch had done before. This way, he completely missed mainland Australia, but did finally find land at the island of Tasmania on [[November 24]]. He named it ''Van Diemen's Land'', but later [[United Kingdom|British]] [[colonist]]s would rename it after Tasman. After some investigation, he sailed further east, and discovered [[New Zealand]], which he named ''Staten Landt'' on the theory that it was connected to a piece of [[Staten Island, Argentina|land]] south of the tip of [[South America]]. He sailed north along its west coast. At the northern end of the [[South Island]] he anchored the ships in a [[Golden Bay|bay]], where five of his sailors were killed in his first and only encounter with the [[Māori]]. (Schools in New Zealand during the early 1950s taught that Abel Tasman mistook the Maori challenges blown on conch shells as a welcome and instructed his bugler to return the challenges, note for note. Hence the attack that night.) Tasman named it ''Murderers' Bay'' (now known as [[Golden Bay]]) and sailed north, but mistook [[Cook Strait]] for a bight (naming it ''Zeehaen's Bight''), believing ''Staten Landt'' to be a single land, and part of [[Terra Australis]]. En route back to Batavia, he came across the [[Tonga]] archipelago on [[January 21]], [[1643]].  Two names that he bestowed on New Zealand landmarks still endure: [[Cape Maria Van Diemen]] and [[Three Kings Islands]].

[[Image:Tasmanroutes.PNG|thumb|350px|Tasman's routes]]
On his second voyage, in [[1644]], he followed the south coast of [[New Guinea]] eastward. He missed the [[Torres Strait]] between New Guinea and Australia, and continued his voyage along the Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia.

From the point of view of the VOC, Tasman's explorations were a disappointment: He had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. For over a century (until the era of [[James Cook]]), Tasmania and New Zealand were not again visited by Europeans. Australia was visited, but usually only by accident.

As with many explorers, Tasman's name has been honored in many places. These include:
*the [[island]] of [[Tasmania]], including features such as
**the [[Tasman Peninsula]]
**the [[Tasman Bridge]]
**the [[Tasman Highway]]
**the passenger/vehicle ferry [[Abel Tasman (ship)|Abel Tasman]]
*the [[Tasman Sea]]
*in New Zealand:
**the [[Tasman Glacier]]
**the [[Tasman River]]
**[[Mount Tasman]]
**the [[Abel Tasman National Park]]
**[[Tasman Bay]]
**the [[Tasman, New Zealand | Tasman District]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Algebraic geometry''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] which, as the name suggests, combines [[abstract algebra]], especially [[commutative algebra]], with [[geometry]]. It can be seen as the study of [[solution set]]s of systems of '''algebraic equations'''. When there is more than one variable, geometric considerations enter and are important to understand the phenomenon. One can say that the subject starts where [[equation solving]] leaves off, and it becomes at least as important to understand the totality of solutions of a system of equations as to find some solution; this does lead into some of the deepest waters in the whole of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.

== Zeroes of simultaneous polynomials ==

In classical algebraic geometry, the main objects of interest are the vanishing sets of collections of [[polynomial|polynomials]], meaning the set of all points that simultaneously satisfy one or more polynomial equations.  For instance, the two-dimensional [[sphere]] in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt; could be defined as the set of all points &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; with 

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+z^2-1=0&lt;/math&gt;.

A &quot;slanted&quot; circle in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as the set of all  points &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; which satisfy the two polynomial equations

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+z^2-1=0&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;x+y+z=0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Affine varieties ==

First we start with a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k''.  In classical algebraic geometry, this field was always &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;, the complex numbers, but many of the same results are true if we assume only that ''k'' is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]].  We define &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n_k&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''affine n-space over k''', to be ''k&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.  The purpose of this apparently superfluous notation is to emphasize that one `forgets' the vector space structure that ''k&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' carries.  Abstractly speaking, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n_k&lt;/math&gt; is, for the moment, just a collection of points.  

Henceforth we will drop the ''k'' in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n_k&lt;/math&gt; and instead write &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Define a function 

:&lt;math&gt;f:{\mathbb A}^n\to{\mathbb A}^1&lt;/math&gt;

to be '''regular''' if it can be written as a polynomial, that is, if there is a polynomial ''p'' in 

:''k''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] 

such that for each point 

:(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) 

of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n&lt;/math&gt;, 

:''f''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''p''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  

Regular functions on affine ''n''-space are thus exactly the same as polynomials over ''k'' in ''n'' variables.  We will write the regular functions on &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;k[{\mathbb A}^n]&lt;/math&gt;.

We say that a polynomial ''vanishes'' at a point if evaluating it at that point gives zero.  Let ''S'' be a set of polynomials in &lt;math&gt;k[{\mathbb A}^n]&lt;/math&gt;.  The ''vanishing set of S'' (or ''vanishing locus'') is the set ''V''(''S'') of all points in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^n&lt;/math&gt; where every polynomial in ''S'' vanishes.  In other words, 

:''V''(''S'')={(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) | for all ''p'' in ''S'', ''p''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0}.  

A subset of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n&lt;/math&gt; which is ''V''(''S''), for some ''S'', is called an '''algebraic set'''.  The ''V'' stands for ''variety'' (a specific type of algebraic set to be defined below).

Given a subset ''V'' of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n&lt;/math&gt; which is a variety, can one recover the set of polynomials which generate it? If ''V'' is ''any'' subset of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n&lt;/math&gt;, define ''I''(''V'') to be the set of all polynomials whose vanishing set contains V.  The ''I'' stands for [[ideal_(ring_theory)|ideal]]: if two polynomials ''f'' and ''g'' both vanish on ''V'', then ''f''+''g'' vanishes on ''V'', and if ''h'' is any polynomial, then ''hf'' vanishes on ''V'', so ''I''(''V'') is always an ideal of &lt;math&gt;k[{\mathbb A}^n]&lt;/math&gt;.

Two natural questions to ask are: given a subset ''V'' of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n&lt;/math&gt;, when is 

:''V'' = ''V''(''I''(''V''))?  

Given a set ''S'' of polynomials, when is 

:''S'' = ''I''(''V''(''S''))?  

The answer to the first question is provided by introducing the [[Zariski topology]], a topology on &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n&lt;/math&gt; which directly reflects the algebraic structure of &lt;math&gt;k[{\mathbb A}^n]&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''V'' = ''V''(''I''(''V'')), if and only if ''V'' is a Zariski-closed set.  The answer to the second question is given by [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]].  In one of its forms, it says that ''I''(''V''(''S'')) is the [[prime radical]] of the ideal generated by ''S''. In more abstract language, there is a [[Galois connection]], giving rise to two [[closure operator]]s; they can be identified, and naturally play a basic role in the theory.

For various reasons we may not always want to work with the entire ideal corresponding to an algebraic set ''V''.  [[Hilbert's Basis Theorem]] implies that ideals in &lt;math&gt;k[{\mathbb A}^n]&lt;/math&gt; are always finitely generated.

An algebraic set is called '''irreducible''' if it cannot be written as the union of two smaller algebraic sets. An irreducible algebraic set is also called a '''variety'''.  It turns out that an algebraic set is a variety if and only if the polynomials defining it generate a [[prime ideal]] of the polynomial ring.

== Regular functions ==

Just as [[continuous function|continuous functions]] are the natural maps on [[topological space|topological spaces]] and [[smooth function|smooth functions]] are the natural maps on [[differentiable manifold|differentiable manifolds]], there is a natural class of functions on an algebraic set, called regular functions.  A '''regular function''' on an algebraic set V contained in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the restriction of a regular function on &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n&lt;/math&gt;, in the sense we defined above.

It may seem unnaturally restrictive to require that a regular function always extend to the ambient space, but it is very similar to the situation in a [[normal space|normal]] [[topological space]], where the [[Tietze extension theorem]] guarantees that a continuous function on a closed subset always extends to the ambient topological space.

Just as with the regular functions on affine space, the regular functions on V form a ring, which we denote by k[V].  This ring is called the '''coordinate ring of V'''.

Since regular functions on V come from regular functions on &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n&lt;/math&gt;, there should be a relationship between their coordinate rings.
Specifically, to get a function in k[V] we took a function in &lt;math&gt;k[{\mathbb A}^n]&lt;/math&gt;, and we said that it was the same as another function if they gave the same values when evaluated on V.  This is the same as saying that their difference is zero on V.  From this we can see that k[V] is the quotient &lt;math&gt;k[{\mathbb A}^n]/I(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

== The category of affine varieties ==

Using regular functions from an affine variety to &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^1&lt;/math&gt;, we can define regular functions from one affine variety to another.  First we will define a regular function from a variety into affine space: Let V be a variety contained in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^n&lt;/math&gt;.  Choose ''m'' regular functions on V, and call them f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.  We define a '''regular function''' f from V to &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^m&lt;/math&gt; by letting f(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)=(f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;).  In other words, each f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; determines one coordinate of the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of f.

If V' is a variety contained in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb A}^m&lt;/math&gt;, we say that f is a '''regular function''' from V to V' if the range of f is contained in V'.  

This makes the collection of all affine varieties into a [[category theory|category]], where the objects are affine varieties and the [[morphism]]s are regular maps.  The following theorem characterizes the category of affine varieties:

: The category of affine varieties is the [[dual (category theory)|opposite category]] to the category of finitely generated [[reduced (ring theory)|reduced]] k-[[algebra_over_a_field|algebras]] and their homomorphisms.

== Projective space == 

Consider the variety V(y=x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  If we draw it, we get a [[parabola]].  As x increases, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (x,x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) becomes larger and larger.  As x decreases, the slope of the same line becomes smaller and smaller.

Compare this to the variety V(y=x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).  This is a [[cubic equation]].  As x increases, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (x,x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) becomes larger and larger just as before.  But unlike before, as x decreases, the slope of the same line again becomes larger and larger.  So the behavior &quot;at infinity&quot; of V(y=x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is different from the behavior &quot;at infinity&quot; of V(y=x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  It is, however, difficult to make the concept of &quot;at infinity&quot; meaningful, if we restrict to working in affine space.

The remedy to this is to work in [[projective space]].  Projective space has properties analogous to those of a [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]].    Among other things, it lets us make precise the notion of &quot;at infinity&quot; by including extra points.  The behavior of a variety at those extra points then gives us more information about it.  As it turns out, V(y=x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) has a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] at one of those extra points, but V(y=x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is smooth.

While [[projective geometry]] was originally established on a [[synthetic geometry|synthetic]] foundation, the use of [[homogeneous coordinates]] allowed the introduction of algebraic techniques.  Furthermore, the introduction of projective techniques made many theorems in algebraic geometry simpler and sharper: For example, [[Bézout's theorem]] on the number of intersection points between two varieties can be stated in its sharpest form only in projective space.  For this reason, projective space plays a fundamental role in algebraic geometry.

== The modern viewpoint ==

The modern approach to algebraic geometry redefines the basic objects.  Varieties are subsumed in [[Alexander Grothendieck]]'s concept of a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]].  Schemes start with the observation that if finitely generated reduced k-algebras are geometrical objects, then perhaps arbitrary commutative rings should also be geometrical objects.  As such, schemes become both a more general algebro-geometric object, and a convenient language to describe those objects. This language of schemes has proved to be a valuable way of dealing with geometric concepts and has become a cornerstone of modern algebraic geometry.

== Notes and history ==
Algebraic geometry was largely developed by [[Islamic mathematics|Islamic mathematicians]], particularly the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician/poet [[Omar Khayyám]] (born [[1048]]). He was well known for inventing the general method of solving [[cubic equation]]s by intersecting a parabola with a circle. In addition he discovered the [[binomial expansion]], and authored criticisms of [[Euclid]]'s theories of parallels which made their way to [[England]], where they contributed to the eventual development of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. Omar Khayyám also combined the use of [[trigonometry]] and [[approximation theory]] to provide methods of solving algebraic equations by geometrical means.

Algebraic geometry was further developed by the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry|Italian geometers]] in the early part of the 20th century.  Enriques classified [[algebraic surface|algebraic surfaces]] up to [[birational isomorphism]].  The style of the Italian school was very intuitive and does not meet the modern standards of [[rigor]].

By the [[1930s]] and [[1940s]], [[Oscar Zariski]], [[André Weil]] and others realized that algebraic geometry needed to be rebuilt on foundations of [[commutative algebra]] and [[valuation theory]].  Commutative algebra (earlier known as [[elimination theory]] and then [[ideal theory]], and refounded as the study of commutative rings and their [[module (mathematics)|modules]]) had been and was being developed by [[David Hilbert]], [[Max Noether]], [[Emanuel Lasker]], [[Emmy Noether]], [[Wolfgang Krull]], and others.  For a while there was no standard foundation for algebraic geometry.

In the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]] [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck]] recast the foundations making use of the theory of [[sheaf theory]]. Later, from about 1960, the idea of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] was worked out, in conjunction with a very refined apparatus of [[homological algebra|homological techniques]]. After a decade of rapid development the field stabilised in the [[1970s]], and new applications were made, both to [[number theory]] and to more classical geometric questions on algebraic varieties, [[singularity theory|singularities]] and [[moduli space|moduli]].

An important class of varieties, not easily understood directly from their defining equations, are the [[abelian varieties]], which are the projective varieties whose points form an abelian [[group (mathematics)|group]].
The prototypical examples are the [[elliptic curve]]s, which have a rich theory. They were instrumental in the proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]] and are also used in [[elliptic curve cryptography]].

While much of algebraic geometry is concerned with abstract and general statements about varieties, methods for effective computation with concretely-given polynomials have also been developed. The most important is the technique of [[Gröbner basis|Gröbner bases]] which is employed in all [[computer algebra]] systems.

The City of '''Austin''' is the capital of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]].  According to the 2000 [[U.S. Census]], Austin has a population of 656,562 people, making it the fourth-largest city in Texas and the 16th largest in the [[United States]]. A 2004 U.S. Census estimate placed the population of the city at 681,804. Situated in the region of [[Central Texas]], the [[Texas metropolitan areas|Austin-Round&amp;nbsp;Rock metropolitan area]] is one of the fastest-growing in the United States and is home to an estimated population of 1.4 million as of 2004.

The first documented settlement of current day Austin occurred in 1835 and the site was named [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1837. Waterloo was purchased by [[The Republic of Texas]] in 1839 and [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] renamed the city in honor of [[Stephen F. Austin]]. Its original name is honored by local businesses such as Waterloo Ice House and [[Waterloo Records]]. Austin is situated on the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]], and there are three man-made (artificial) lakes within the city limits: [[Town Lake]], [[Lake Austin]], and Lake Walter E. Long. Additionally, the foot of [[Lake Travis]] (including [[Mansfield Dam]]), is located within the city's limits. The city is also situated on the [[Balcones Fault]], which in much of Austin runs roughly the same route as the [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|MoPac expressway]].

Residents of Austin are called &quot;Austinites&quot; and include a heady mix of university [[professors]] and their students, [[politicians]] and [[lobbyists]]. Austin, home to several large sites for major technology corporations such as [[Apple Computer]], [[Dell Computer]], [[IBM]], [[Applied Materials]], [[AMD]], [[Samsung]], and [[Freescale]], is the center of a high-technology region known as '''Silicon Hills'''. It is also the self-proclaimed ''Live Music Capital of the World''.

==History==
===Early settlers===
For several hundred years before the arrival of [[European]] settlers, the area around present-day Austin was inhabited by a mixture of [[Tonkawa]], [[Comanche]], and [[Lipan Apache]] Indians, who fished and hunted along the creeks, including present-day [[Barton Springs]].

In the late 1700s the [[Spain|Spanish]] set up temporary missions in the area, later moving to [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]].

===Anglo American settlers===
[[Image:Stephen f austin.jpg|180px|thumb|left|[[Stephen F. Austin]]]]

The first Anglo-American settlers arrived in the area in the 1830s when Texas was still part of [[Mexico]]. They founded the village of Waterloo along the banks of the Colorado River. According to local folklore, [[Stephen F. Austin]], the &quot;father of Texas&quot;, negotiated a peace treaty with the local Indians at the site of the present day [[Treaty Oak, Austin|Treaty Oak]] after several settlers were killed in raids.  According to local legend, Austin also negotiated a boundary treaty with the Indians that laid out the fledgling town's limits.

===Republic of Texas===
In 1839, Waterloo was chosen to become the capital of the new [[Republic of Texas]], and the town was renamed Austin in honor of Stephen F. Austin.

A [[grid plan]] for the new capital's streets was surveyed by [[Edwin Waller|Judge Edwin Waller]] (after whom [[Waller Creek]] was named). The grid survives nearly intact in present-day downtown Austin. The north-south streets of the grid were named for the rivers of Texas, following an east-west progression from [[Sabine River|Sabine]] Street to [[Rio Grande]] Street ([[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]] Street being &quot;out of order&quot; to the west of Sabine Street). The exception was the central thoroughfare [[Congress Avenue]], which leads from the far south side of town over the river to the foot of the hill where the new [[Texas State Capitol]] was to be constructed. The original north-south grid was bookended by West Avenue and East Avenue (now [[Interstate 35]]).

The east-west streets of the grid followed a progression uphill from the river and were named after trees native to the region, with [[Pecan|Pecan Street]] as the main east-west thoroughfare. The east-west streets were later renamed in a numbered progression, with Pecan Street becoming Sixth Street. The original tree-named streets survive in nostalgic names, including Pecan Street, which is the name of a locally-produced beer.

In October 1839, the entire government of the Republic of Texas arrived by oxcart from [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. By the next January, the population of the town was 839.

Also in 1839, the Congress of the [[Republic of Texas]] set aside 40 acres (160,000 m²) of land near downtown Austin for a &quot;university of the first class&quot;. This land became the central campus of [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]] in 1883.

In 1842, Austin almost lost its status as capital city during the [[Texas Archive War]].  President [[Sam Houston]] had tried to relocate the seat of government from Austin to Houston, and then to [[Washington-on-the-Brazos]].  In the dead of night on [[December 29]], [[1842]], a group of men was sent to take the archives of Texas from Austin to Washington-on-the-Brazos. [[Angelina Eberly]] fired a cannon at the men, who made their escape, only to be caught by another group of men who returned the archives back to Austin.

===1845 to 1899===
After [[Texas]] was admitted to the [[United States|Union]] in 1845, two unsuccessful statewide elections were held that attempted to move the capital elsewhere.

From 1861 to 1865, Texas was part of the Confederacy.

[[St. Edward's University]] (then St. Edward's Academy) was founded in 1878 by Rev. [[Edward Sorin]], Superior General of the Congregation of Holy Cross, on South Austin farm land.

In September 1881, the city schools admitted their first public school classes. That same year, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute, the forerunner of [[Huston-Tillotson University]], opened to the public.

In 1882 construction began on [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]] campus with the placement of the cornerstone of the Main Building. The university formally opened in 1883.

[[Image:Texas state capitol_1.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Texas State Capitol]]

The [[Texas State Capitol]] was completed in 1888 on the site specified in the 1839 plan. At the time it was billed as the &quot;seventh largest building in the world.&quot;

In 1891, the neighborhood of [[Hyde Park, Austin|Hyde Park]] was developed north of the University of Texas as a [[streetcar suburb]].

In 1893, the [[Great Granite Dam]] on the Colorado River was constructed, stabilizing the river's flow and providing hydroelectric power.

===1900 to 1969===
In 1910, the concrete Congress Avenue Bridge across the Colorado River opened, fostering development along South Congress Avenue.  The Littlefield Building at 6th and Congress downtown also opened this same year.

In 1911, a streetcar line was extended into South Austin, allowing for the development of [[Travis Heights]] in 1913.

In the 1930s, the Great Granite Dam was replaced by a series of seven dams built by the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]], which created the string of reservoirs that now define the river's course through Austin. [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]], then a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], was instrumental in getting the funding authorized for these dams.

On [[August 1]], [[1966]], Austin was terrorized by [[Charles Whitman]], who shot and killed 16 people with a high-powered rifle from the clocktower of the Main Building of the University of Texas. The event is considered the most traumatic in the city's history.

===1970 to 1989===
In the 1970s, Austin became a refuge for a group of [[Country music|Country and Western]] musicians and songwriters seeking to escape the music industry's corporate domination of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. The best-known artist in this group was [[Willie Nelson]], who became an icon for what became the city's &quot;alternate music industry.&quot;  The [[Armadillo World Headquarters]] gained a national reputation during the 1970s as a venue for these anti-establishment musicians as well as mainstream acts. In the following years, Austin gained a reputation as a place where struggling musicians could launch their careers in informal live venues in front of receptive audiences. This ultimately led to the present-day moniker the city uses of &quot;Live music capital of the world.&quot;

During the 1970s and 1980s, the city experienced a tremendous boom in development that temporarily halted with the [[Savings and Loan crisis]] in the late 1980s. The growth led to an ongoing series of fierce political battles that pitted preservationists against developers. In particular the preservation of Barton Springs, and by extension the [[Edwards Aquifer]], became an issue which defined the themes of the larger battles.

===1990 to present===
[[Image:Austin_skyline.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Downtown high-rises, viewed from the west]]
In the 1990s, the boom resumed with the influx and growth of a large technology industry. Initially the technology industry was centered around larger, established companies such as [[IBM]], but in the late 1990s, Austin gained the additional reputation of being a center of the [[dot-com boom]] and subsequent [[dot-com bust]]. Austin is also known for [[game development]], [[filmmaking]], and [[popular music]].

In 2000, Austin became the center of an intense media focus as the headquarters of presidential candidate and Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]]. Interestingly, the headquarters of his main opponent, [[Al Gore]], were in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], thus re-creating the old country music rivalry between the two cities.

As Austin became known as a location for creative individuals, corporate retail branches also moved into town and displaced many 'home-grown' businesses.  To many long-time Austinites, this loss of landmark retail establishments has left a void in the city's culture. In response, &quot;[[Keep Austin Weird]]&quot; became a popular rallying cry and many Austinites have reacted with renewed support of local businesses.

==Geography==
According to the 2000 [[United States Census Bureau]], Austin is located at 30&amp;deg;18'01&quot; North, 97&amp;deg;44'50&quot; West (30.300474, -97.747247){{GR|1}}. According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 669.3 [[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]] (258.4 [[square mile|mi&amp;sup2;]]).  651.4 km&amp;sup2; (251.5 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is land and 17.9 km&amp;sup2; (6.9 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is water.  The total area is 2.67% water.

Austin is situated on the Colorado River, with three man-made (artificial) lakes wholly within the city limits:  [[Town Lake]], [[Lake Austin]], and Lake Walter E. Long. Additionally, the foot of [[Lake Travis]], including [[Mansfield Dam]], is located within the city's limits. Town Lake, Lake Austin, and Lake Travis are all on the Colorado River. The city is also situated on the [[Balcones Fault]], which, in much of Austin, runs roughly the same route as the [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|MoPac Expressway]]. The eastern part of the city is flat, whereas the western part and western suburbs consist of scenic rolling hills on the edge of the [[Texas Hill Country]].  Because the hills to the west are primarily [[limestone]] rock with a thin covering of topsoil, the city is subjected to frequent [[flash flood]]ing from the excessive runoff caused by [[thunderstorm]]s. To help control this runoff and to generate [[hydroelectric power]], the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] operates a series of [[dam]]s that form the [[Texas Highland Lakes]]. The lakes also provide venues for [[boating]], [[swimming]], and other forms of [[recreation]] within several [[park]]s located on the lake shores.

A popular point of prominence in Austin is [[Mount Bonnell]]. At about 780 feet above sea level, it is a natural limestone formation overlooking [[Lake Austin]] on the Colorado River, approximately 200 feet below its summit.

==Economy==
Thousands of graduates each year from the engineering and computer science programs at The University of Texas provide a steady source of young, talented and driven employees that help to fuel Austin's technology sector. The metro Austin area also has much lower housing costs than, for example, [[Silicon Valley]]. As a result of the relatively high concentration of high tech companies in the region, Austin was strongly affected by the [[dot-com]] boom in the late 1990s and subsequent bust, although recovery is proceeding rapidly.

Austin's biggest employers include the State of Texas, The University of Texas, the SETON Healthcare Network, [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], [[IBM]] and [[Freescale|Freescale Semiconductor]] (spun off from [[Motorola]] in 2004). Other high-tech companies in Austin include [[Apple Computer]], [[Vignette (software)|Vignette]], [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]], [[Intel]], [[Motive Inc]], [[Cirrus Logic]], [[Samsung]], [[National Instruments]], [[United Devices]] and [[Sun Microsystems]]. The proliferation of technology companies has led to the region's nickname, &quot;the Silicon Hills,&quot; (Austin was originally &quot;Silicon Gulch&quot;, but it seems that [[San Jose, California]] already has that distinction) and has spurred rapid development that has greatly expanded the city to the north and south.

Other globally well known companies, such as [[Hoover's, Inc.]], a business research and publishing company, are headquartered in the city.

==Government and politics==
{{seealso|List of current and former capital cities within U.S. states}}

===Law and government===
[[Image:Austin downtown.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Downtown Austin and the State Capitol as seen from the Congress Avenue Bridge over Town Lake]]

Austin is administered by a [[city council]] of seven members, each of them elected by the entire city, and by an elected [[mayor]] under the weak [[mayor-council government]] system of municipal governance. Council and mayoral elections are non-partisan, with a runoff in case there is no 50 percent majority winner. Austin remains an anomaly among large Texas cities in that the council is not elected by districts, though there has been a strong effort to change the election system to one of single districts.

===Politics===
The main political actors within Austin city politics are interest groups such as the pro-environmental [[Save Our Springs Alliance]], the [[Austin Police Association]], [[Austin Toll Party]] and the [[Austin Business Council]].

The political controversy that dominated the 1990s was the conflict between [[environmentalist]]s, strong in the city center, and advocates of urban growth, who tend to live in the outlying areas. The city council has in the past tried to mitigate the controversy by advocating [[smart growth]], but growth and environmental protection are still the main hot-button issues in city politics. Today conservatives in Austin argue that the cities various highway traffic problems are rooted in the denial of past highway/infrastructure development by political action committees who do not support highway expansion.

Austin is well known as a center for [[liberalism|liberal]] politics in a generally [[conservatism|conservative]] state, leading some Texas conservatives to deride the city as &quot;The People's Republic of Austin.&quot; Austin's suburbs, especially to the west and north, and several satellite municipalities, however, tend toward political conservatism.

As a result of the major party realignment that began in the 1970's, central Austin became a stronghold of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] while the suburbs tend to vote [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. To a limited degree the division between Democratic and Republican precincts coincides with the aforementioned divisions between supporters of environmental regulations and supporters of urban growth. One consequence of this is that in the most recent redistricting plan, formulated by the Republican-majority legislature, the central city has been split among multiple sprawling districts that do not conform to any unifying economic, geographic or cultural theme. Many political observers have characterized the resulting districting layout as [[gerrymander|gerrymandering]].  The plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists, but was upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003; in December 2005, the [[United States Supreme Court]] accepted an appeal of this decision for argument on [[1 March]] [[2006]]. [http://www.statesman.com/search/content/news/stories/local/12/13REDISTRICT.html]

Overall, the city leans Democratic; in the 2004 presidential election, Senator [[John Kerry]] won a substantial majority of the votes in Travis County as illustrated in this [http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/vote2004/countymap.htm pictorial of votes by-county]. Of Austin's six state legislative districts, three are strongly Democratic, one leans Republican, and two are swing districts presently held by Democrats. However, two of its three congressional districts are presently held by Republicans; this is largely due to the 2003 redistricting, which left Austin with no congressional seat of its own. Travis County was also the only county in Texas to reject [[Texas Constitutional Amendment Proposition 2]] &amp;#8212; effectively outlawing gay marriage and status equal or similar to it &amp;#8212; and did so by a wide margin (40% for, 60% against).

The combination of economic conservatism with social liberalism has also made Austin an active area for the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].  Although the Libertarians remain a third party, the party is very active in the Austin area, and one of the past Libertarian presidential candidates, [[Michael Badnarik]], comes from Austin. Republican congressman Ron Paul is from the Texas Gulf Coast and used to represent neighboring counties surrounding Travis County.

==People and culture==
[[Image:Sixth Street Austin.jpg|thumb|right|When the sun goes down, the sights and sounds of the pubs, restaurants and nightclubs on 6th street come alive]]
Austin has a vibrant live [[Music of Austin|music scene]] (boasting more music venues per capita than any other U.S. city) revolving around many [[nightclub]]s on [[6th Street (Austin)|6th Street]] and an annual [[film]]/[[music]]/[[multimedia]] festival known as [[South by Southwest]]. The longest-running concert music program on American television, ''[[Austin City Limits]]'', is videotaped on the [[University of Texas at Austin]] campus. ''Austin City Limits'' and [[Waterloo Records]] run the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]], an annual music and art festival held at [[Zilker Park]] in Austin. Other annual events include [[Eeyore's Birthday Party]] in April and [[Carnaval]] in February.

Austinites take great pride in being eccentric and celebrate the differences between themselves and other U.S. cities. &quot;[[Keep Austin Weird]]&quot; has become a local [[motto]] in recent years, featured on innumerable bumper stickers and t-shirts. This motto has not only been used in promoting Austin's eccentricity and diversity, but is also meant to bolster support of local and independent businesses. Another prime example of Austin's &quot;weirdness&quot; is [[Leslie Cochran]], a [[vagrant]] [[drag queen|transvestite]] who has run for mayor multiple times and, in Cochran's best showing, received 7.77% of the vote in [[2000]].

Famous Austin residents include cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]], businessman [[Michael Dell]], tennis player [[Andy Roddick]], actors [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Matthew McConaughey]] and [[Angela Bettis]], musicians [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Terry Bozzio]], cartoonist and filmmaker [[Mike Judge]], directors [[Terrence Malick]], [[Richard Linklater]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]], and [[science fiction]] writer [[Bruce Sterling]]. Former residents include [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[George W. Bush]]. Austin was also the longtime home of the late blues guitarist [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]. Rock singer [[Janis Joplin]] lived in Austin for several years and played one of her first gigs at Threadgill's (a local restaurant and bar).

==Architectural landmarks==
[[Image:Moonlight tower.jpg|thumb|60px|A moonlight tower]]

Buildings that comprise Austin's skyline are modest in height and somewhat spread out. The latter characteristic is due to a restriction that preserves the view of the Texas Capitol building from various locations around Austin. Austin's current tallest building, the Frost Bank Tower, opened in 2004 and stands at 515 feet.

The Congress Avenue Bridge houses the world's largest urban bat population, which has become a favorite with locals and tourists alike. In the summer, the colony has up to 1.5 million [[Mexican Free-tailed Bat]]s; in the winter they migrate to Mexico.

The iconic [[Pennybacker Bridge]], also known as the &quot;360 Bridge,&quot; crosses Lake Austin to connect north and south [[Texas Loop 360|Loop 360]].

At night, parts of Austin are lit with &quot;artificial moonlight.&quot;  Several [[moonlight tower]]s, built in the late 19th century and recognized as historic landmarks, illuminate the central part of the city.  The towers were prominently featured in the film ''[[Dazed and Confused (movie)|Dazed and Confused]]''. The &quot;Zilker Tree&quot; is a [[Christmas]] &quot;tree&quot; made of large lights strung from the top of the Moonlight Tower that stands in [[Zilker Park]]. The Zilker Tree is lit in early December along with the &quot;Trail of Lights,&quot; an Austin Christmas tradition.

==Education==
[[Image:Utcampus_night.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]]]]
Austin is home to [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]], the largest university in the state of Texas and flagship institution of [[University of Texas System|The University of Texas System]], also the largest state system of higher education in Texas. Other institutions of higher learning include [[Austin Community College]], [[Concordia University (Austin)|Concordia University]], [[Huston-Tillotson University]] and [[St. Edward's University]].

Most of the city is covered by the [[Austin Independent School District]]. Parts of Austin are served by other districts, including [[Round Rock Independent School District]], [[Pflugerville Independent School District]], [[Leander Independent School District]], and [[Eanes Independent School District]].

==Media and entertainment==
The University of Texas at Austin has an outstanding [http://rtf.utexas.edu/ Department of Radio-Television-Film] and, partly because of this, Austin has been the location of a number of movies, including ''[[Man of the House (2005 comedy film)|Man of the House]]'', ''[[Secondhand Lions]]'', ''[[Waking Life]]'', ''[[Spy Kids]]'', ''[[Dazed and Confused (movie)|Dazed and Confused]]'', ''[[Office Space]]'', ''[[The Life of David Gale]]'', ''[[Miss Congeniality]]'', ''[[Doubting Thomas]]'' and ''[[Slacker (movie)|Slacker]]''. In order to draw future film projects to the area, the [[Austin Film Society]] has converted several disused buildings from the now-defunct Mueller Airport into a state-of-the-art digital filmmaking center known as [[Austin Studios]]. Among the projects to have used facilities at Austin Studios are music videos by [[The Flaming Lips]], and feature films such as ''[[25th Hour]]'' and ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''.

Austin is home to several well-known directors, including [[Robert Rodriguez]], [[Richard Linklater]] and [[Tim McCanlies]]. It is also home to several other entertainers including [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Shawn Colvin]] and [[Sara Hickman]]. Austin hosts the annual [[Austin Film Festival]], as well as the [[South by Southwest]] festival, which draw films of many different types from all over the world. In 2004 the city was first in ''Moviemaker Magazine's'' annual top ten cities to live and make movies. Austin also hosts the annual [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]], which attracts musical artists from around the world. The 2005 festival included Oasis, Coldplay and Franz Ferdinand.

[[MTV]] taped an [[Austin Season (The Real World)|Austin season]] of its hit [[reality television]] series ''[[The Real World]]'' in 2005.

Austin is also a center for the art of [[magic (illusion)|magic]]. Magician and actor [[Harry Anderson]] once called Austin home. Anderson's long-time collaborator Turk Pipkin is still a local resident. Magician [http://www.petertheadequate.com/ Peter the Adequate], who performs in [[Branson, Missouri]], developed a good deal of his unique style in Austin.  Austin is also home to Ron Cartlidge, noted expert on [[Houdini]] and avid magic collector. Cartlidge has documented Houdini's tours in Texas, including two appearances in Austin, in his book ''Houdini's Texas Tours - 1916 &amp;amp; 1923''.

==Sports==
Among the professional sports teams in Austin are the [[Austin Ice Bats]] of the [[Central Hockey League]], the [[Austin Wranglers]] of the [[Arena Football League]], and the [[Austin Toros]] of the [[National Basketball Development League|NBDL]].  The [[Round Rock Express]], affiliated with the [[Houston Astros]], are located in nearby [[Round Rock, Texas]] and play Triple-A baseball in the [[Pacific Coast League]]. Austin is also home to the [[Texas Longhorn Athletics|University of Texas Longhorns]] who recently won the 2005 [[College World Series]] (baseball) and 2005 [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|National Championship]] in the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] (football).

==Transportation==
Austin is served by these major highways: [[Interstate 35]]; U.S. Highways [[U.S. Highway 183|183]] and [[U.S. Highway 290|290]]; Texas State Highways [[Texas State Highway 45|45]], [[Texas State Highway 71|71]], [[Texas State Highway 130|130]], [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|Loop 1/MoPac]] and [[Texas State Highway Loop 360|Loop 360]].

[[Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], or Capital Metro, provides public transportation to the city, primarily by bus. A [[regional rail|commuter rail]] plan, under the authority of Capital Metro, is underway and scheduled for completion in [[2008]]. The system &amp;#8212; which will be built on pre-existing freight rail lines &amp;#8212; will serve Downtown Austin, East Austin, Northwest Austin and Leander in the first phase.

Austin's main airport is [[Austin-Bergstrom International Airport]], located 5 miles (8 km) southeast of the city.

An [[Amtrak]] [[Texas Eagle]] station is located west of Downtown. Segments of the Amtrak route between Austin and San Antonio are being evaluated for a future passenger rail corridor as an alternative to the traffic congestion of Interstate-35.

==Suburban Area==
Suburbs include [[Lakeway, Texas|Lakeway]], [[Round Rock, Texas|Round Rock]], [[Bastrop, Texas|Bastrop]], [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]], and [[Georgetown, Texas|Georgetown]].  In addition, [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] is within 75 miles of Austin.

      <comment>/* Assemblers */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the category of computer programming tools''.'' See [[Assembler (disambiguation)]] for other meanings''.

An '''assembler''' is a [[computer program]] for translating '''[[assembly language]]''' &amp;mdash; essentially, a [[mnemonic]] representation of [[machine language]] &amp;mdash; into [[object code]]. A '''cross assembler''' (see [[cross compiler]]) produces code for one type of processor, but runs on another.

As well as translating assembly instruction mnemonics into [[opcode]]s, assemblers provide the ability to use symbolic names for memory locations (saving tedious calculations and manually updating addresses when a program is slightly modified), and [[macro]] facilities for performing textual substitution &amp;mdash; typically used to encode common short sequences of instructions to run inline instead of in a [[subroutine]].

Assemblers are far simpler to write than [[compiler]]s for [[high-level language]]s, and have been available since the [[1950s]]. Modern assemblers, especially for [[RISC]] based architectures, such as [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], Sun [[SPARC]] and HP [[PA-RISC]], optimize [[instruction scheduling]] to exploit the [[CPU pipeline]] efficiently.

[[High-level assembler]]s provide high-level-language abstractions such as advanced control structures, high-level procedure/function declarations and invocations, and high-level abstract data types including structures/records, unions, classes, and sets.

==Assemblers==
For any given personal computer, mainframe, embedded system, and game console, both past and present, at least one--possibly dozens--of assemblers have been written. For some examples, see the [[list of assemblers]].

On [[Unix]] systems, the assembler is traditionally called [[as (Unix)|as]], although it is not a single body of code, being typically written anew for each port. A number of Unix variants use [[GNU Assembler|GAS]]. 

Within processor groups, each assembler has its own dialect. Sometimes, some assemblers can read another assembler's dialect, for example, TASM can read old MASM code, but not the reverse. FASM and NASM have similar syntax, but each support different macros that could make them difficult to translate to each other. The basics are all the same, but the advanced features will differ.

Also, assembly can sometimes be portable across different operating systems on the same type of [[CPU]]. Calling conventions between operating systems often differ slightly to none at all, and with care it is possible to gain some portability in assembly language, usually by linking with a [[C programming language|C]] library that does not change between operating systems. However, it is not possible to link portably with C libraries that require the caller to use preprocessor macros that may change between operating systems.

For example, many things in [[libc]] depend on the preprocessor to do OS-specific, C-specific things to the program before compiling.  In fact, some functions and symbols are not even guaranteed to exist outside of the preprocessor. Worse, the size and field order of structs, as well as the size of certain typedefs such as off_t, are entirely unavailable in assembly language, and differ even between versions of [[Linux]], making it impossible to portably call functions in libc other than ones that only take simple integers and pointers as parameters.

Some higher level computer languages, such as [[C programming language|C]], support [[Inline assembler|Inline assembly]] where relatively brief sections of assembly code can be embedded into the high level language code.

Many people use an [[emulator]] to debug assembly-language programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Argument from consensus''' or '''argument from common consent''' purports to prove the existence of God. It can be summarized as follows.

&quot;Throughout the world, in all lands, people believe in some God.  And not just now, but in the past, a belief in some God was a very common part of daily life.  So the person who denies that God exists is opposing the common consent of all of humanity, that God exists.  Who are we to oppose such an enormous consensus?  Therefore, God exists.&quot;

This argument has a number of problems.

*Not ''everyone'' in ''all'' times has believed that [[God]] exists.  There have been dissenters, atheists, everywhere. Furthermore, it is misleading to describe all religions as theistic - the Dalai Lama, for instance, has called Buddhism an &quot;atheistic religion&quot;. For more on this, see the next point...

*There are a number of different ''versions'' of God that people believe in: the gods of the ancient Greeks are very different from the Hindu gods, which are very different indeed from the spirits that some Africans traditionally worship, which are of course very different still from the [[Judeo-Christian]] God.  At the very best, the most one could say is that ''some higher power of some sort'' has been ''commonly'', although not universally, thought to exist.

*The argument as stated does not differentiate between the actual existence of some form of God(s) and the desire for God(s). Widespread belief in God could reflect ''either'' God's existence or the desire of a community (in this case, humanity) for a protective force to answer difficult questions ranging from the reason for thunder ([[Thor]]) to what happens after death ([[Heaven]]).  Children in many countries believe in [[Santa Claus]], not because he exists, but because they wish he did, and they have been encouraged in their belief by their parents.  This highlights another problem:

*Reinforced opinions are still opinions.  The established churches in countries across the world have encouraged belief in their tenets throughout history.  It is natural for people raised in a tradition to believe that tradition, just as children believe in Santa because parents tell them it's true, and parents don't generally lie to their children.

*Finally, and most importantly, the argument engages in a [[logical fallacy]] known as the [[argumentum ad numerum|bandwagon fallacy]]. Essentially, the fact that there is widespread consensus about a topic does not mean that the consensus is correct.  A commonly cited example is that most people in medieval Europe believed that the Earth was flat, but that did not change the fact that the Earth is round.  This example is itself an example&amp;mdash;the fact that the Earth was round was quite well established in medieval Europe, but not widely discussed because it had no significant impact on people.  So our widespread belief about these people in no way affects what they actually knew about the shape of the planet.

These problems have led many to abandon the ''argument from common consent'', and is not nowadays taken seriously in philosophy or theology.

The '''argument from morality''' is one of several [[arguments for the existence of God]]. This argument comes in different forms, all aiming to prove God’s existence from the evidence of morality in the world.

==The argument==
The moral argument works on the idea that most people have some experience of morality, and feel there are certain rules about how they should behave.  

===Divine Command===
# Moral law requires a moral lawgiver.
# There is a moral law.
# There must be a moral lawgiver. (from 1 and 2)
# This moral lawgiver is God.

The two premises must, of course, be defended separately.  However, usually this argument is employed with those (the great majority of the human population) who already subscribe to the second premise.  Thus, the first premise is the more oft-debated.  That the moral lawgiver is God must also be justified, but so with most arguments for God's existence must the proven entity be shown to be God as regularly understood (e.g., that Aquinas' prime mover is the God of the Bible).  This is not, however, a circular argument.

Another argument from morality can be expressed as follows:
# If [[God]] exists, then God and God alone decides what is (truly) right and wrong. Without God there could be no ultimate standards of [[morality]].
# So, if people assumed that God does not exist, then they would be doomed to a life without fixed moral standards. They would have no reasons to think that [[lie|lying]], [[theft|stealing]], or even [[murder]] are wrong. According to this view, nonbelievers contribute to the corruption of themselves and the entire [[culture]]. (Cf the famous quote associated with [[Dostoevsky]], &quot;If God does not exist, everything is permitted&quot;.)
# Given the above, it is necessary that God exists if society is to have stable standards of morality.
# Everyone in society either obviously needs or already has stable standards of morality. Therefore, God exists.

That is the basis of [[theological ethics]], or alternatively, the [[divine command theory]].  The argument is valid if and only if the following assumptions are correct:

# There is an ultimate standard of morality.
# People are able to know God's commands, and the sources of such knowledge are infallible.
# Something is right if and only if God commands it; something is wrong if and only if God forbids it; and something is morally permissible if and only if God neither commands nor forbids it.
# God's standards are stable; God's commands are as valid today as they were when the infallible sources of information were created.
# There is no alternative source of moral and ethical ideas and action, meaning that all other systems such as [[utilitarianism]] are invalid; that is to say, even if they ultimately endorse the same morals they are wrong about what it is that makes those things moral.

A third variant of the argument from morality is based on the existence of standards, and the existence of conscience in humans. In any argument, various standards are appealed to, and only unreasonable arguers would make claims like &quot;I am right because I think I am.&quot; If no standard really exists, then no ''[[justice]]'' system can ever be objectively just, and all justice systems would be shams, which is assumed to be untrue. Therefore, it is argued that the standards of moral good exists external from ourselves, and are not arbitrary. Since such standards exist, so must God.

===Pointing towards God===
This form of the moral argument interprets morality as an indirect religious experience which points towards God.  
# Our feelings of obligation guide us to make a moral decision.
# This obligation is due to the fact that each person has value,  and this supports each decision.
# If people have an intrinsic value, there must be a source to this value.
# This source must be God.

===Kant's argument===
[[Immanuel Kant]] believed that in a perfect world behaving morally should lead to happiness.  However, as this rarely happens in our world, he considered that there must be another answer.
He argued that there are certain rational laws which we feel duty bound to follow, and these he called categorical imperatives.  He concluded that if this is true, we can assume three things: 
*Freedom – We must have the freedom to act
*Immortality – happiness will eventually reward us
*God – there is a regulating being that will reward virtue with happiness.

His argument is thus:
# If it is our unconditional duty to follow these moral laws, it must be our unconditional duty to aim for the goal of these laws, and so we seek to bring about the highest good.
# Humans do not have enough power to bring about the highest good.  Even with perfect morality, we cannot ensure the perfect happiness that should follow.
# However, if we aim for the highest good, it must be possible to achieve it.  If we are unable to attain this goal in our present life, there must be someone else to ensure we can attain it in a future life.
# God has this necessary power, therefore we can assume the existence of God.

Kant believes that this does not prove the existence of God, but our sense of morality implies the world is ordered in a moral way.

==Criticisms==

===Logical flaws===
&lt;!-- This section is is just a stub I wrote late at night. I will probably update this soon, but as always extensions are encouraged and appreciated [[User:Infinity0|Infinity0]] 23:12, [[21 September]] [[2005]] (UTC) --&gt;

The most common attack on the logic of this argument is by the conclusion (4), which is an assumption. Objections point out that there is no reason to assume that God is the moral lawgiver; or that if he exists, he should be the only moral lawmaker. Such an assumption requires knowledge of the existence of God (which is what the argument is trying to prove) and of the character of God (which is disputed).

Indeed, there is no reason to suppose (or given by the argument) why morality is objective, or that people themselves are not the moral lawgivers. Morality can easily be explained as a [[social contract]] which everybody agrees to for the purpose of maximising survival - if everybody acted as they wished, most people would invariably end up committing selfish acts (eg. to gain power and possessions) at the expense of others; eventually nobody would live. Some people might unconditionally wish not to do harm, other people might wish not to do harm to prevent harm from being done to themselves. However, the result of a social contract being formed is the same.

Another criticism of the existence of standards variant, in addition to the argument for using man as the moral lawgiver, is that it equates the &quot;ultimate standard&quot; and God, and that this is an example of [[equivocation]].

===Contrary evidence===

Many argue this argument makes the prediction that since God is the source of morality, then someone who believes that (and behaves as if) God does not exist, i. e. a nonbeliever, should generally behave less morally than a believer. Therefore, the argument goes, nonbelievers should perform immoral actions more frequently than believers.

Some of these immoral actions fall under the category of secular crime in most legislations around the world (such as homicide, rape and theft); others are punished in some but considered private actions in others (homosexual intercourse, drug consumption); other are considered immoral by certain religions (such as divorce).

The prediction has been found to fail in the following cases:
*In the United States, a 1999 poll by the Barna Research Group showed that in fact certain religious groups, such as Jews, Mainline Protestants, and Evangelical Christians, get divorced more often than atheists.
*If prison statistics in the USA are reliable, religious people are imprisoned by at least 40 times the rate of atheists.
*Believers have been solely responsible for countless historical atrocities, including (but certainly not limited to) the [[Crusades|Crusades]] and the [[September 11]] attacks. While atheists have also been responsible for some atrocities, such as the [[Soviet]] [[gulag]] camps of [[Joseph Stalin]] or the genocide of the [[Khmer Rouge]], they are not primarily motivated by their religious beliefs.

Statistics for other measures of morality provide similar results.

However, many advocates of the moral argument deny that the prediction is valid, arguing that believers who don't act morally are not  correctly interpreting God's morality, and that non-believers who do act morally may still believe in morality, but only not see it as connected to God.

===Responses and counter-responses===

'''Response:''' Many theists, or believers, will argue that the prediction stated above does not logically stem from its premises, i.e., that (4) is a [[non-sequitur]]. Thus, from this point of view, the &quot;contrary evidence&quot; would in essence be evidence against a [[Straw_man|straw man]].

[[Christian|Christians]], for example, argue that The Absolute Moral Law is written in our consciences, those of both believers and non-believers (Romans 2:15). It would then follow that the morals accepted by both believers and non-believers are essentially the same. Therefore we would logically expect their behavior to be essentially the same as well. The theist making this argument would claim that that is exactly what we see throughout history and even in modern societies today.

'''Response:''' The prediction claimed above assumes that because believers believe, they will always (or usually) act on this belief. Many Christians will state that this is contrary to well-established Christian doctrine, that all are sinners (Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:8), including Christians. Simply believing in a god of some sort does not necessarily enable anyone to behave more righteously than anyone else.

'''Response:''' When assessing the above tests and &quot;morality measures&quot; in the prediction, some issues must be taken into account:
*How terms such as &quot;religious&quot;, &quot;nonreligious&quot;, &quot;atheist&quot;, &quot;agnostic&quot;, &quot;believer&quot;, &quot;nonbeliever&quot;, etc. are defined, if at all.
*Whether the tests assume that there are no factors correlated with religiosity or belief that may influence the measurement.
*Whether the statistics have taken into account the religious demographics of the U.S. namely that the 'religious' far outnumber the atheists, which could account for the above results.
*Whether society prosecutes and punishes the &quot;correct&quot; crimes (are laws moral? are the police, the judicial system, etc. biased towards believers or nonbelievers?).
*Whether there is such a thing as a &quot;right&quot; crime, or whether it's all relativistic.

The last point may be raised by some believers as an objection. It is entirely possible that those who make the laws are failing to conform with the &quot;correct&quot; moral standards (for example, most modern societies do not punish divorce or homosexual behaviour, which most believers consider to be morally wrong).

'''Response:''' Many theists may posit that certain societies, such as that of the United States, have been so molded by believers, that the modern individual morals of [[Atheist|atheists]] are often molded by the historic values of the believers in that society. Thus, the behaviors of the two would be very similar in most circumstances.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Counter-response:''' While this may be so in some cases, there is nothing to suggest that this is always the case (i.e., the argument is not universal or objective). Indeed, there are counterexamples, for example in [[Ancient China]] where there was no structured concept of [[God]], yet it had a highly advanced moral and legal system for its time.

'''Response:''' Another viewpoint to consider is that if God is not responsible for morality, then moral values are simply social constructs (or [[memes]]) created by a certain individual or group to abridge the behavior of another group to benefit themselves or others like themselves. (For example, a mother who has been abandoned by her partner may teach her sons not to cheat on their wives to spare other women from her pain, which eventually leads to the concepts of monogamy and chastity.) In this way, morality originates as a principle of self-preservation. But as it is propagated, it is ingrained into the younger generation and colours their conception of morality. The logical conclusion to this viewpoint is that the morals of a society are ultimately subjective (even though certain morals are quite ubiquitous, suggesting a common psychological prompt), so nothing is objectively wrong.

A possible reason that certain morals are so ubiquitous in otherwise divergent societies, is to be found in evolutionary theory. If consider that a society may be susceptible to [[natural selection]], we can determine that certain moral behaviors, when practiced by a majority of a population, will give an advantage to those societies that practice them over those that do not (see [[Evolutionary psychology]], [[Game theory]], [[Evolutionarily Stable Strategy]], etc). Thus, rather than having a divine source, morality simply consists of a consensus behavior that benefits the population as a whole.

==Counterarguments==

Some structured counterarguments include:

'''Morality doesn't depend on the existence of a god'''
#Humankind's core [[motivation]]s are greed and a fear of the [[wrath]] of [[God]].
#[[Greed (emotion)|Greed]] is defined as wanting things that [[benefit]] oneself, possibly at the expense of others, and avoiding things that cause [[detriment]] to oneself, possibly at the expense of others.
#Greed causes people to want to experience as little [[suffering]] as possible since suffering is [[unpleasant]].
#[[Morality]] is defined as a set of [[rules]] that one should follow to prevent suffering.
#Assume morality can only come from fear of God's wrath.
#Then a world devoid of God would have no morality. (by 5)
#Since greed is the only remaining motivation, people will engage in immoral behavior in order to satisfy their greed. (by 1, 2, 6)
#This causes a [[state of nature]].
#Due to greed, humankind is eventually motivated to lessen the overall suffering of humanity (and thus its individuals) by preventing a state of nature. (by 1, 3)
#Governments of some sort are established to further this goal. (by 9)
#Governments create and enforce a [[social contract]]. (by 10)
#This contract is a form of morality. (by 4, 9)
#But this contradicts Assumption 6 and its Logical Consequence 7.
#Therefore Assumption 6 is incorrect, thus morality doesn't only come from a fear of God's wrath.

{{The Holocaust}} 

'''Auschwitz''' is the name loosely used to identify the largest [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[extermination camp]] along with two main [[German concentration camps]] and 45-50 sub-camps. The name is derived from the German name for the nearby [[Poland|Polish]] town of [[Oświęcim]] (pronounced {{IPA|[oʃˈventʃiːm]}}), situated about 60 [[kilometre]]s (37 [[mile|mi]]) southwest of [[Kraków]]. Beginning in 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] built several [[concentration camp]]s and an [[extermination camp]] in the area, which at the time had been [[annexation|annexed]] by Nazi Germany. The camps were a major element in the perpetration of [[the Holocaust]], killing around 1.1-1.6 million people, of whom over 90% were [[Jew]]s.

The three main camps were:
* Auschwitz I, the original concentration camp which served as the administrative centre for the whole complex, and was the site of the deaths of roughly 70,000 people, mostly [[Poles]] and [[Soviet]] [[Prisoners of War]]
* Auschwitz II ([[Birkenau]]), an [[extermination camp]] and the site of the deaths of at least 1.1 million [[Jew]]s, 75,000 [[Poles]], and some 19,000 [[Roma (people)|Roma]]
* Auschwitz III ([[Monowitz]]/[[Monowice]]), which served as a [[labor camp]] for the Buna-Werke factory of the [[IG Farben]] [[concern]].

See [[List of subcamps of Auschwitz]] for others. The exact number of people killed in the camps is not known, but most modern estimates are around 1.1-1.6 million.

Like all Nazi concentration camps, the Auschwitz camps were operated by [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. The commandants of the camp were the SS-Obersturmbannführers [[Rudolf Höß]] (sometimes transliterated in English as &quot;Hoess&quot;) until Summer 1943, and later [[Arthur Liebehenschel]] and [[Richard Baer]]. Höß provided a detailed description of the camp's workings during his interrogations after the war and also in his autobiography. He was hanged in [[1947]] in front of the entrance to the [[crematorium]] of Auschwitz I.  Chief of the women's field was handled by [[Johanna Langefeld]], [[Maria Mandel]] and last by [[Elisabeth Volkenrath]]. 

About 700 prisoners attempted to escape from the Auschwitz camps during the years of their operation, with about 300 attempts successful. A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees were sometimes arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others.

== The camp ==
=== Auschwitz I ===
[[Image:Auschwitz gate brama 1940s.jpg|thumb|180px|Entrance to Auschwitz in 1941. The slogan ''[[Arbeit macht frei]]'' over the gate translates as &quot;Work (shall) make (you) free&quot; (or &quot;work liberates&quot;)]]
[[image:auschwitz I.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Auschwitz I concentration camp in 2001]]
[[Image:Auschwitz-2.jpg|thumb|180px|View of Auschwitz in the winter(2002)]]

Auschwitz I served as the administrative center for the whole complex. It was founded on [[May 20]], [[1940]], on the basis of an old Polish brick army barracks. A group of 728 [[Poland|Polish]] political prisoners from [[Tarnów]] became the first residents of Auschwitz on [[June 14]]th that year. The camp was initially used for interning Polish intellectuals and resistance movement members, then also for Soviet Prisoners of War. Common German criminals, &quot;anti-social elements&quot; and 48 German [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] were also imprisoned there. [[Jew]]s were sent to the camp as well, beginning with the very first shipment (from Tarnów). At any time, the camp held between 13,000 and 16,000 inmates; in 1942 the number reached 20,000.

The entrance to Auschwitz I was (and still is) marked with the cynical sign &quot;[[Arbeit macht frei]]&quot;, &quot;Work (shall) make (you)  free&quot; (or &quot;work liberates&quot;). The camp's prisoners who left the camp during the day for construction or farm labour were made to march through the gate at the sounds of an orchestra. Contrary to what is depicted in several films, the majority of the Jews were imprisoned in the Auschwitz II camp, and did not pass under this sign.

The SS selected some prisoners, often German criminals, as specially privileged supervisors of the other inmates (so-called: ''kapo''). The various classes of prisoners were distinguishable by special marks on their clothes; Jews were generally treated the worst. All inmates had to work; except in the associated arms factories, Sundays were reserved for cleaning and showering and there were no work assignments.  

The harsh work requirements, combined with poor nutrition and hygiene, led to high death rates among the prisoners.

Block 11 of Auschwitz I was the &quot;prison within the prison&quot;, where violations of the numerous rules were punished. Some prisoners had to spend several days in tiny cells too small to sit down. Others were executed by shooting, hanging or starving.

[[image:Auschwitz I Entrance.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Entrance of Auschwitz I]]
In September 1941, the SS conducted poison gas tests in block 11, killing 850 Poles and Russians using [[Hydrogen cyanide|cyanide]].  The first experiment was on 3 September, 1941, and it killed 600 [[Soviet]] POWs. The substance producing the highly-lethal cyanide gas was sold under the trade name [[Zyklon B]], originally for use as a [[pesticide]] used to kill lice. The tests deemed successful, a gas chamber and crematorium were constructed by converting a bunker. This gas chamber operated from 1941 to 1942 and was then converted into an air-raid shelter.

The first women arrived in the camp on [[March 26]], 1942. From April 1943 to May 1944, the gynecologist Prof. Dr. [[Carl Clauberg]] conducted sterilization experiments on Jewish women in block 10 of Auschwitz I, with the aim of developing a simple injection method to be used on the Slavic people. Dr. [[Josef Mengele]] experimented on twins in the same complex. Prisoners in the camp hospital who were not quick to recover were regularly killed by a [[lethal injection]] of [[phenol]].

The camp brothel, established in the summer of 1943 on [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]]'s order, was located in block 29 and was used to reward privileged prisoners. It was staffed by women specifically selected for the purpose, and by some volunteers from the female prisoners most of whom were raped by the Nazis.

=== Auschwitz II (Birkenau) ===
[[Image:AuschwitzCampEntrance.jpg|thumb|200px|Entrance to Auschwitz II (Birkenau), the main extermination camp, in 2002]]

[[image:birkenau.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Birkenau concentration camp in 2001]]
Auschwitz II (Birkenau) is the camp that many people know simply as &quot;Auschwitz&quot;. It was the site of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands, and the killings of over one million people, mainly [[Jew]]s.

The camp is located in [[Brzezinka]] (Birkenau), about 3 kilometres (1.8 mi) from Auschwitz I. The camp was designed, according to the [[Bauhaus]] concept of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] and construction started in 1941, as part of the ''[[Final Solution]]'' (''Endlösung''). The camp was about 2.5 kilometres by 2 kilometres (1&amp;frac12;&amp;nbsp;mi by 1&amp;frac14;&amp;nbsp;mi) large and was divided into several sections, each of which was separated into fields. Fields as well as the camp itself were surrounded with barbed, electrified wire (which was used by some of the inmates to commit suicide). The camp held up to 100,000 prisoners at one time.

The camp's main purpose, however, was not internment with forced labour (as Auschwitz I &amp; III) but rather extermination. For this purpose, the camp was equipped with four crematoria with [[gas chamber]]s; each gas chamber was designed to hold up to 2,500 people at one time. Large-scale extermination started in Spring 1942.

Most people arrived at the camp by rail, often after horrifying trips in [[cattle cars]] lasting several days. From 1944 railway tracks extended into the camp itself; before that, arriving prisoners were marched from the Auschwitz railway station to the camp. At times, the whole transport would be sent to its death immediately. At other times, the Nazis would perform &quot;selections&quot;, often administered by [[Josef Mengele]], to the end of choosing whom to kill right away and whom to imprison as labour force or use for [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiments]]. Young children were taken from their mothers and placed with older women to be gassed, along with the sick, weak and old.

Those arriving prisoners who survived the initial selection would go on to spend some time in quarantine quarters and eventually work on the camp's maintenance or expansion or be sent to one of the surrounding satellite work camps.

One section of the camp was reserved for female prisoners. In another section known as &quot;Canada&quot; (so named because Germans believed that Canada was a land of vast riches), the belongings of the arriving victims were sorted and stored, to be transferred to the German government.  Items such as banknotes, coins, jewellery, precious metals and diamonds were removed from &quot;Canada&quot; and shipped off to the Reichsbank.

Those selected for extermination were sent to any of four massive gas chamber/crematorium complexes, all at the edge of the camp. Two of the crematoria (Krema II and Krema III) each had an underground undressing room and the underground gas chamber, capable of holding thousands of people. To avoid mass panic, the victims were told that they were going there for showering; to reinforce this impression, shower heads were fitted in the gas chamber, though never connected to a water supply. The victims were ordered to strip naked and leave their belongings in the undressing room in a location that they could subsequently remember, before being led to the adjacent gas chamber. Once the victims were sealed shut in the chamber, the toxic agent [[Zyklon B]] was discharged from openings in the ceiling. Gas chambers in crematoria IV and V were above ground and Zyklon B was poured through the special windows in the walls. An oven room, where selected camp prisoners called ''[[Sonderkommandos]]'' took out the dead bodies and burned them, was part of the same building. 

[[Image:Holocaust-gas-hair.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Empty poison gas canisters and hair from victims, as seen in the Auschwitz museum]]

Jews from many countries were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau to be killed:  300,000 from Poland, 69,000 from France, 60,000 from the Netherlands, 55,000 from Greece, 46,000 from Moravia, 25,000 from Belgium, as well as tens of thousands of Jews from other countries. The largest group of Jews deported to Auschwitz came from Hungary after Germany took control of its former ally in March 1944. Between May and July 1944, about 438,000 Jews from Hungary were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau and the most were killed there. When the crematoria could not keep up, bodies were burned in open pits. {{ref|anat1}}.

Many Roma had been imprisoned in a special section of the camp, mostly in family units. They were gassed in July 1944. On [[10 October]], eight hundred [[Roma (people)|Roma]] children were systematically killed at Birkenau.

On [[October 7]], 1944, the Jewish ''Sonderkommandos'' (those prisoners kept separate from the main camp and involved in the operation of the gas chambers and crematoria) staged an uprising. Female prisoners had smuggled in [[explosive]]s from a weapons factory, and crematorium IV was partly destroyed by an explosion. The prisoners then attempted a mass escape, but nearly all of the 250 were killed soon after.

Many of the inmates enslaved here survived less than a year due to their harsh living conditions.
Birkenau was liberated on January 27, 1945.

===Auschwitz III and satellite camps===
:''Also see [[List of subcamps of Auschwitz]]''
The surrounding satellite work camps were closely connected to German industry and were associated with arms factories, foundries and mines. The largest work camp was Auschwitz III Monowitz, named after the  Polish village of [[Monowice]]. Starting operations in May 1942, it was associated with the synthetic rubber and liquid fuel plant ''Buna-Werke'' owned by [[IG Farben]]. In regular intervals, doctors from Auschwitz II would visit the work camps and select the weak and sick for the gas chambers of Birkenau.  The largest subcamps were built at [[Trzebinia]], [[Bleechammer]] and [[Althammer]].  Female subcamps were constructed at [[Budy]] , [[Plawy]], [[Zabrze]], [[Gliwice|Gleiwitz]] I, II, III, [[Rajsko]] and at [[Lichtenwerden]].

=== Knowledge of the Allies ===
[[Image:May311944 auschwitz.jpg|thumb|250px|A photograph of Birkenau, taken May 31, 1944 by a Mosquito plane from South African Air Force, sent to take photographs of the fuel factory at nearby Monowitz.  The photographic analysts missed the significance of the photograph, it was identified in the late 1970s and analyzed by the CIA in 1978.  Smoke can been seen coming from Crematoria V, indicating that a group of prisoners were recently gassed.]] 
Some information regarding Auschwitz reached the Allies during 1941-1944, such as the reports of [[Witold Pilecki]] and [[Jerzy Tabeau]], but the claims of mass killings were generally dismissed as exaggerations.   This changed with receipt of the very detailed report of two escaped prisoners, [[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfred Wetzler]], which finally convinced most Allied leaders of the truth about Auschwitz in the middle of 1944.

Detailed air reconnaissance photographs of the camp were taken accidentally during 1944 by aircraft seeking to photograph nearby military-industrial targets, but no effort was made to analyse them.  (In fact, it was not until the 1970s that these photographs of Auschwitz were looked at carefully.)

Starting with a plea from the Slovakian rabbi [[Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl|Weissmandl]] in May 1944, there was a growing campaign to convince the Allies to bomb Auschwitz or the railway lines leading to it.  At one point [[Winston Churchill]] ordered that such a plan be prepared, but he was told that bombing the camp would most likely kill prisoners without disrupting the killing operation, and that bombing the railway lines was not technically feasible.  Later several nearby military targets were bombed.  One bomb accidentally fell into the camp and killed some prisoners.  The debate over what could have been done, or what should have been attempted even if success was unlikely, has continued heatedly ever since.

=== Evacuation and liberation ===
The gas chambers of Birkenau were blown up by the Germans in November 1944 in an attempt to hide their crimes from the advancing Soviet troops. On [[January 17]], [[1945]] Nazi personnel started to evacuate the facility; most of the prisoners were [[Death marches (Holocaust)|marched West]]. Those too weak or sick to walk were left behind; about 7,500 prisoners were liberated by the [[322nd Infantry]] unit of the [[Red Army]] on [[January 27]], 1945.

'Liberation' was not necessarily the end of the ordeal for many prisoners.  Soviet POWs were accused of collaborating with the Germans and were either executed or sent to [[gulags]] in the Soviet Union.

==Death toll==
Since the Nazis attempted to destroy the evidence of the mass murder at Auschwitz, the exact number of victims is impossible to fix with certainty.  Early efforts to count the number of dead relied on the testimony of witnesses, especially Nazi [[Rudolf Hoess]], who gave the number of dead at 2.5-3 million.  Though this number, and a higher total of 4 million, was used by Soviet and Polish authorities, it was never taken seriously by Western scholars, who generally supported numbers of around 1-2 million. In 1983, French scholar George Wellers was one of the first to use Nazi data on deportations to estimate the number killed at Auschwitz, arriving at 1.613 million dead, including 1.44 million Jews and 146,000 Poles.  A larger study started around the same time by Franciszek Piper used time tables of train arrivals combined with deportation records to calculate 1.1 million Jewish deaths and 140,000-150,000 Polish victims, along with 23,000 Roma. This number has met with &quot;significant, though not complete&quot; agreement among scholars.{{note|anat1}}

== After the war ==
After the war, the camp served as a prison of the [[NKVD]] through most of 1945 and then remained in a state of disrepair for several years. The ''Buna Werke'' were taken over by the Polish government and became the foundation for the chemical industry of the region. 

The Polish government then decided to restore Auschwitz I and turn it into a museum honouring the victims of [[nazism]]; Auschwitz II, where buildings were prone to decay, was preserved but not restored. Today, the Auschwitz I museum site combines elements from several periods into a single complex: for example the gas chamber at Auschwitz I (which did not exist by the war's end) was restored and the fence was moved (because of building being done after the war but before the establishment of the museum). However, in most cases the departure from the historical truth is minor, and is clearly labelled.

[[Image:Auschwitzruins.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site - ruins at Birkenau, 2002]]
Auschwitz II and the remains of the gas chambers there are also open to the public. The Auschwitz concentration camp is part of the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Sites]].

In 1979, the newly elected Polish [[Pope John Paul II]] celebrated Mass on the grounds of Auschwitz II to some 500,000 people. After the pope had announced that [[Edith Stein]] would be [[beatification|beatified]], some Catholics erected a cross near bunker 2 of Auschwitz II where she had been gassed. A short while later, a Star of David appeared at the site, leading to a proliferation of religious symbols there; eventually they were removed.

[[Carmelites|Carmelite nun]]s opened a convent near Auschwitz I in 1984. After some Jewish groups called for the removal of the convent, representatives of the Catholic Church agreed in 1987. One year later the Carmelites erected the 8 metre (26 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) tall cross from the 1979 mass near their site, just outside block 11 and barely visible from within the camp. This led to protests by Jewish groups, who said that mostly Jews were killed at Auschwitz and demanded that religious symbols be kept away from the site. Some Catholics have pointed out that the people killed in Auschwitz I were mainly Polish Catholics. The Catholic Church told the Carmelites to move by 1989, but they stayed on until 1993, leaving the large cross behind. In 1998, after further calls to remove the cross, some 300 smaller crosses were erected by local activists near the large one, leading to further protests and heated exchanges. Following an agreement between the Polish Catholic Church and the Polish government, the smaller crosses were removed in 1999 but the large papal one remains. See [[Auschwitz cross]] for more details.

In 1996, Germany made [[27 January]], the day of the liberation of Auschwitz, the official day for the commemoration of the victims of 'National Socialism'.

The [[European Parliament]] marked the anniversary of the camp's liberation in 2005 with a minute of silence and the passage of this resolution: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[[27 January]] [[2005]], the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of [[Nazi Germany]]'s death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where a combined total of up to 1.5 million [[Jew]]s, [[Roma (people)|Roma]], [[Poles]], [[Russians]] and prisoners of various other nationalities, and [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], were murdered, is not only a major occasion for European citizens to remember and condemn the enormous horror and tragedy of the Holocaust, but also for addressing the disturbing rise in [[anti-semitism]], and especially anti&amp;#8209;semitic incidents, in Europe, and for learning anew the wider lessons about the dangers of victimising people on the basis of [[race]], [[ethnic origin]], [[religion]], social classification, [[politics]] or sexual orientation.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Other Controversies ===
For many years, a memorial plaque placed at the camp by the Soviet authorities and the Polish communist government stated that 4 million people had been murdered at Auschwitz.  This number was never taken seriously by Western historians, and was never used in any of the calculations of the death toll at Auschwitz (which have generally remained consistently around 1-1.5 million for the last sixty years) or for the total deaths in the Holocaust as a whole.  After the collapse of the Communist government, the plaque was removed and the official death toll given as 1.1 million.  [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] have attempted to use this change as [[propaganda]], in the words of Nizkor: &quot;Deniers often use the 'Four Million Variant' as a stepping stone to leap from an apparent contradiction to the idea that the Holocaust was a hoax, again perpetrated by a conspiracy. They hope to discredit historians by making them seem inconsistent. If they can't keep their numbers straight, their reasoning goes, how can we say that their evidence for the Holocaust is credible? One must wonder which historians they speak of, as most have been remarkably consistent in their estimates of a million or so dead. In short, all of the denier's blustering about the 'Four Million Variant' is a specious attempt to envelope the reader into their web of deceit, and it can be discarded after the most rudimentary examination of published histories.&quot;[http://www.nizkor.org/features/techniques-of-denial/four-million-02.html]

Recently the Polish media and the foreign ministry of Poland have voiced objections to the use of the expression &quot;Polish death camp&quot; in relation to Auschwitz, as they feel that phrase might misleadingly suggest that Poles (rather than Germans) perpetrated the Holocaust.   Most media outlets now show awareness of the offence this may cause, and try to avoid using such expressions (or issue an apology after using them, see for example the recent [http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1401179,00.html note] in ''[[The Guardian]]'').

The Polish film directors [[Andrzej Munk]] and [[Andrzej Wajda]] were both given permission to film in Auschwitz for the films ''[[Passenger (film)|Pasażerka]]'' and ''Krajobraz Po Bitwie'' respectively. However, permission was denied to Steven Spielberg for ''[[Schindler's List]]''. His Auschwitz scene was therefore filmed outside the near-symmetrical entrance, with scenery added to make it look like the real thing.

In February 2006, [[Poland]] refused to grant visas to Iranian researchers who were planing to visit [[Auschwitz]].[http://www.payvand.com/news/06/feb/1145.html].   Polish Foreign Minister Stefan Mellar said his country should stop Iran from investigating the scale of the Holocaust, which Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has dismissed as a myth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Archery_target.jpg|thumb|180px|These arrows score as an inner 10, and a 9]]
'''Archery''' is the practice of using a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] to shoot [[arrow|arrows]]. Archery has historically been used in hunting and combat, and has become a precision sport. One term for an archer is a ''toxopholite'', which derives from [[ancient Greek language|ancient Greek]].

==History==

===Beginnings===
Archaeologists suspect that archery may have begun up to 15,000 years ago, but the earliest concrete evidence is between 8,000 and 9,000 years old. The bow probably originated for use in hunting, and was then adopted as a tool of warfare. Bows eventually replaced the [[atlatl]] as the predominant means for launching projectiles. Archery was practiced in antiquity on every continent except Australia, demonstrating that it is both basic and versatile.

===Classical archery===

Classical civilizations, notably the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]]/[[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], Iranian [[Parthian]]ns, [[India]]ns and [[China|Chinese]], fielded large numbers of archers in their armies. Arrows proved exceptionally destructive against massed formations, and the use of archers often proved decisive. Archers sometimes rode on horseback, combining range with speed. [[Apollo]], [[Odysseus]], and other mythological characters are often depicted with a bow.

The phrase &quot;A parting shot&quot; comes from 'The Parthian shot' as a rider turned in the saddle to shoot as he rode away from the enemy.

===Medieval European archery===

[[Image:Equipement.archer.png|thumb|right|200px|An English longbowman.]]

During the Middle Ages, archery in warfare was not as prevalent and dominant in Western Europe as popular myth dictates. Archers were quite often the lowest paid soldiers in an army or conscripted from the peasantry. This was due to the cheap nature of the bow and arrow as compared to the expense needed to equip a professional [[man-at-arms]] with good armour and a sword. The bow was seldom used to decide battles and viewed as a &quot;lower class weapon&quot; or a toy by the nobility. This disdain was countered by the Vikings, whose widespread use of archery gave them success in their numerous raiding expeditions all over the Western European seaboard (and even well into the Mediterranean) in the [[9th century|9th]] and [[10th century|10th]] centuries.

By the time of the [[Hundred Years' War]], the English had learned how to employ massed archery (as opposed to dispersed skirmishing) as an instrument of tactical dominance with their [[English longbow]]s. Archers were drawn from the freeholding farmers known as [[yeoman|yeomen]], and trained rigorously from childhood. Every boy was given a bow of his own height and was required to train with it. Tournaments were sponsored to encourage proficiency. 

In combat, they would often shoot two arrows, one on a high trajectory, and one on a low trajectory. These two arrows would hit the enemy simultaneously from two different angles, making defense difficult. The advent of the [[bodkin point]] also gave arrows better penetrative power.

The [[crossbow]], while dating from classical times, became quite popular during the Middle Ages. While it took many years to train a longbowman, someone could become proficient with a crossbow with little training. The crossbow had about the same power and range as a longbow. Its major drawback was that it took a long time to reload. The armour piercing power of the crossbow caused fear amongst the well armoured nobility, and it was banned by the [[Second Council of the Lateran]] (at least between Christians), although to little avail.

The advent of [[firearm]]s rendered bows obsolete in warfare. Although bows had a longer range and could shoot much more frequently than the earliest guns, guns could penetrate most armour and required minimal training. Later development gradually gave firearms advantages over bows in range, accuracy and eventually in reload time. An illustration of the declining popularity of the bow could be seen in the various edicts promulgated by 16th-century English monarch to make archery a mandatory practice for all men of fighting age, including Henry VIII's famous ban against the practice of all sports other than archery in Sundays.

The term &quot;Second String&quot; (or the phrase 'to have more than one string to your bow') derives from the fact that medieval archers would carry a second string in the event that their &quot;first string&quot; snapped.

===Asian archery===
[[Image:Ladakharchery.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An archery contest in [[Ladakh]], [[India]]]]
Archery was also highly developed in [[Asia]]. In modern times it continues to be practised in some Asian countries but is not used in international competition.  Central Asian tribesmen were extremely adept at archery on horseback, and the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] used it to dominate the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. Horse archers would shoot while approaching their target, then turn around in the saddle and shoot again after they passed.

The arrows are less stiff than western arrows with smaller fletchings. Bows vary widely.

The bow is held clasped to the chest, arrow point slightly up.  Both arms are extended, the left arm up and toward the target, the right arm back and away from the target. The bow and arrow are drawn down into a line with both arms locked on opposite sides of the body, but the elbow of the right arm is permitted to flex.  In some styles the bowstring and fletchings may actually be held ''behind'' one's head.  The arrow is held at the first joint of the thumb, and the string rests on a [[thumbring]] (Mongol or [[Manchu]]) or a slot at the base of a gauntlet's thumb ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] tsuri), so it does not hurt the thumb.  A headband may be worn to keep the bowstring from hurting one's ear or head.  Thick, loose clothing protects the bowstring from the arms and chest at release. Warriors on the battlefield often wore leather gauntlets, chest armor and [[helmet]]s with flared ridges to protect against the bowstring.

Foot-bows were known and sometimes used in warfare; they were preferred to crossbows because they had a faster firing rate and somewhat longer range.  The basic technique was for archers to lie on their backs, with the bows held to to their feet; they would put the arrow between their feet, and pull back the string with both hands, using their back and legs to bend the bow. Aiming was poor, but with the weight and velocity of the five foot long arrows, combined with massed volleys, this became less important.

Archery was widespread in [[India]]. [[Arjuna]]'s bow, [[Gandiva]], was the Indian equivalent of [[King Arthur]]'s [[Excalibur]].

===Recurve target archery===

This section focuses on the accepted technique for modern competition which is used worldwide. Many other variations exist, some of which are documented below.

The bow is held in the hand opposite the [[eye dominance | dominant eye]]. This hand is referred to as the '''bow hand''' and its arm the '''bow arm.''' The opposite hand is called the '''string hand.''' Terms such as '''bow holder''' or '''string elbow''' follow the same convention. Right eye dominant people hold the bow with their left hand, have their left side facing the target, sight towards the target with their right eye, and handle the arrow and string with their right hand.

Generally one wears a [[bracer (archery)|bracer]] (more commonly known as an arm-guard) to protect the inside of the bow arm, and a [[finger tab|tab]] to protect the fingers of the string hand. Some archers also wear protection on their chests called chestguards (see photo). Chestguards are to protect the bowstring from the archer but can also protect the archer from the bowstring. 

To shoot an arrow with a recurve bow, an archer first adjusts stance. The bow shoulder is towards the target. The archer straddles the shooting line with his or her feet shoulder width apart.

To load, the bow is pointed toward the ground and the shaft of the arrow is placed on an arrow rest attached to the bow. The bowstring is then placed into the notch at the back of the arrow. This is called ''nocking the arrow.'' Typical arrows with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane is pointing away from the bow. This vane is often coloured differently and has numerous names such as ''index fletch'' and ''cock-feather.''

The bowstring and arrow are held with three fingers. When using a sight, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below. The string is usually placed in either the first or second joint of the fingers.

The bow is then raised and drawn. This is often one fluid motion which tends to vary from archer to archer. The string hand is drawn towards the face, where it should rest lightly at an ''anchor point''. This point is consistent from shot to shot, and is usually at the corner of the mouth or on the chin. The bow arm is pushed outward toward the target. The elbow of this arm should be rotated outward so that the bowstring doesn't scrape the inside of the wrist or catch on a [[bracer (archery)|bracer]] when released. The bow should always remain vertical.

In proper form, the archer stands erect, forming a T. The archer's back [[muscle]]s are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point. Most bows will be equipped with a mechanical device called a clicker which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length. 

The arrow is typically released by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand. An archer should pay attention to the recoil, or ''follow through'' of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with his or her form.

===Compound Bow Technique===

A [[compound bow]] is designed to reduce the force that an archer must hold, and increase the overall energy stored by the bow. Most compound designs use cams on the ends of the limbs to optimise the leverage exerted by the archer and reduce the holding force of the bow at full draw while maintaining the force through the draw.

The archer usually uses a release aid to hold the string steadily and release it precisely. This attaches to the bowstring at a point and permits the archer to release the string with a pull of a trigger. With less force required to hold a compound bow at draw, the muscles take longer to fatigue, thus giving a compound archer more time to aim. For these reasons, the compound bow is sometimes derogatorily referred to as a &quot;training-wheel bow.&quot; In general, good recurve technique usually makes good compound technique. A compound bow must be adjusted so that its draw length is correct for the archer. The draw length is determined largely by the archer's arm length and shoulder width.

==Hunting==

In [[North America]], as with other hunting methods, bowhunting is regulated on a state-by-state basis. Regulations often address issues such as where (hunting unit), when (season), and what type (male/female) of individual animal species may be taken. In many cases, a special archery season is set aside to minimize interference from rifle hunters. In addition, in an effort to maximize game recovery and shot lethality, there are often technical regulations such as a minimum draw weight for the hunting of big game species. 

In contrast to a rifle hunter, who may shoot effectively from ranges in excess of 200 yards (~180m), a responsible archer will usually restrict shots to 30 yards (~25m) or less depending on factors such as individual ability, the target animal, draw weight, etc. Because archers must be much closer to their target animal, the bow hunter often claims a more intimate hunting experience and must pay special attention to the animal’s sense of smell, hearing, and sight. This limit on effective range is one of the primary challenges that makes the sport of archery hunting attractive.

Game hunted by archers includes all of the North American big game species. Visit &lt;http://www.pope-young.org&gt; for current archery world records. People also occasionally fish with modified bows, a practice called '''bowfishing'''. 

Today, compound bows are usually preferred for hunting, although recurve bows are not uncommon and usually legal. Longbows are often used by those who want to make the hunting experience as traditional as possible, but much more skill is needed to get a clean hit from a longbow than from other bows. Crossbows are generally permitted for disabled hunters, and in 2005 many states allowed able-bodied hunters to use crossbows, a move that has been somewhat controversial among bow hunters. 

As with any weapon, proper practice and practical training will increase the odds that an animal can be taken successfully and humanely, and in fact, an experienced archery hunter can place a kill shot as effectively as a rifle hunter. However, some European countries consider bowhunting unnecessarily cruel to animals and prohibit the sport. Bowhunting, like target archery, was revived in Britain during the Victorian era, but became outlawed when the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1963 excluded bows and crossbows from its list of permitted hunting weapons. Since 2003, Scotland has been considering the reintroduction of bowhunting as a means of controlling its deer population. France, Lithuania and Finland have reintroduced bowhunting since 2000. Several other European countries are considering its reintroduction.

==Modern competitive archery==

[[Image:Archery competition.jpg|thumb|left|Outdoor archery competition.]]

Competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances. This is the most popular form of archery and is called 'Target Archery'.

While people have no doubt been competing with bows for millennia, the first recorded archery competitions began around [[1583]] in [[England]]. Archery has been an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport since [[1900]], with some interruptions. Recently the Koreans have dominated the event, especially the women's divisions. At the Sydney 2000 games, the Korean women won bronze, silver and gold in the individual competition and won gold in the team event. The Korean men have not fared so well in Olympic competition but still produce good results. As of October 2004, every record in the men's and women's open divisions are held by Korea. It should be noted that the Koreans stick primarily to outdoor competition, particularly the 70&amp;nbsp;m Olympic distance. Indoor distances tend to be dominated by European and American archers.

Modern competitive archery is governed by the [http://www.archery.org/ International Archery Association], abbreviated FITA (Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc). Olympic rules are derived from FITA rules.

===Rules===

Archery competitions may be held indoors or outdoors. Indoor distances are 18&amp;nbsp;m and 25&amp;nbsp;m. Outdoor distances range from 30&amp;nbsp;m to 90&amp;nbsp;m (for senior archers, juniors can shoot closer distances), with 70&amp;nbsp;m being used in the Olympic Games. Most outdoor competitions consist of several distances.

Competition is divided into ''ends.'' An archer shoots either 3 or 6 arrows per end, depending on the type of round. After each end, the competitors walk to the target to score and retrieve their arrows. There are 20 ends of 3 arrows in a round of indoor competition. Outdoor competition varies, but outdoor rounds generally involve more arrows being shot. All competitors must wait for the command to shoot and retrieve.

Archers have a set time limit in which to shoot their arrows. For indoor competition, this is 2 minutes. Signalling devices such as lights and flags inform the archers when time is up. Since archery involves the use of potentially lethal weapons, much attention is paid to order and safety.

===Scoring===



Targets are marked with 10 evenly spaced concentric rings, which have score values from 1 through 10 assigned to them. In addition, there is an inner 10 ring, sometimes called the X ring.  This becomes the 10 ring at indoor compound competitions. Outdoors, it serves as a tiebreaker with the archer scoring the most number of X's winning. In FITA archery, targets are coloured as follows:

*1 ring &amp; 2 ring - white
*3 ring &amp; 4 ring - black
*5 ring &amp; 6 ring - blue
*7 ring &amp; 8 ring - red
*9 ring &amp; 10 ring - gold

Archers score each end by summing the scores for their arrows. Line cutters are awarded the higher score. Values scored by each arrow are recorded on a score sheet and must be written in descending order (e.g. if an archer scores 5, 7, 6, 10, 9, 8, this must be recorded as 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.).

However, in the imperial method of scoring, the coloured bands are counted 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The lowest score is for all the white on the target face and the 9 for any gold. Arrows are shot in 'ends' of three with six arrows being released before each count. When a dozen arrows have been shot, the scorer will add up the miss rates, the number of golds and the total score. This will then be repeated a certain number of times depending on the tournament type.

During competition, there are usually at least two archers per target. This is to allow for &quot;double scoring&quot;, a system where two archers will record and sum all scores on individual sheets. This is done to prevent any errors. During and before scoring no one is allowed to touch the arrows. After scoring, each hole is marked before arrows are retrieved. In the event of a &quot;pass through&quot; (the arrow passes straight through the target) or &quot;bouncer&quot; (arrow hits the target and bounces out), points may be awarded to an unmarked hole.

Different rounds and distances use different size target faces. Common sizes (and example rounds they are used in) are:
*40 cm (18m FITA Indoor)
*60 cm (25m FITA Indoor)
*80 cm (30m and 50m FITA)
*122 cm (70m and 90m FITA)
122 cm faces are used in Olympic competition. There are also versions of the 40cm and 60cm targets known as the &quot;3 Spot&quot;. The targets contain 3 instances of the inner 5 rings of the 40cm and 60cm faces arranged in a line or an equilateral triangle.

===Other competition===

'''[[Field Archery]]''' involves shooting at targets of varying and unmarked distance, often in rough terrain. 3D archery focuses on shooting at life-size models of game, and is popular with hunters.

'''Clout Archery (G.N.A.S. rules in the United Kingdom)'''
Similar to target archery, except that the archer attempts to drop arrows at long range (180 yards for the men and 140 yards for women; there are shorter distances for juniors depending on age) into a group of concentric  circular scoring zones on the ground surrounding a marker flag.  The flag is 12 inches square and is fixed to a stick. The flag should be as near to the ground as is practicable. Archers shoot 'ends' of six arrows then, when given the signal to do so, archers proceed to the target area.  A Clout round usually consists of 36 arrows. Clout tournaments are usually a 'Double Clout' round (36 arrows shot twice).  They can be shot in one direction (one way) or both directions (two way).  All bow types may compete (longbows, recurve, barebow and compound). 

* '''Scoring.''' A 'rope' with a loop on the end is placed over the flag stick. This rope is divided into the scoring zones of the target: Gold (5 points), Red (4 points), Blue (3 points), Black (2 points) and White (1 point). The rope is 'walked' around the target area and arrows falling within a particular scoring zone are withdrawn and,on completion of the full circle, are laid out on the rope on the corresponding colours. The designated scorer would then call out the archers' names and the archers would (in turn) call out their scores as they pick up their arrows.

'''Roving Marks'''
A number of marks or flags are set out in an area. Archers shoot from a start point at an elected mark attempting to drop arrows as close as possible. The archer coming closest to the elected mark scores that shot and selects the next mark. Ranges vary. The furthest 'Finsbury' mark is 13 score and 5 (265) yards. When England was a less crowded, country roving marks was a popular pastime and military training. Marks would have been artificial markers or natural features such as tussocks of grass or tree stumps. Roving marks are normally shot with English Longbows.

'''Flight Archery.'''
Flight Archery can only take place where space permits since archers compete by shooting for sheer distance. Archers shoot a number  of arrows and then search for the one which has been shot the farthest, marking it with an identifiable marker. At the end of the round, archers stand or sit by their furthest arrows while judges measure the distances they were shot.There are many classes that one can shoot in, depending on the type of bow and its draw force.

'''Popinjay (or Papingo).'''
A form of archery originally derived from shooting birds on church steeples. It is almost unheard of outside of Belgium. Archers stand within 12 feet (3.7 m) of the bottom of a 90 ft (27 m) mast and shoot almost vertically upwards with 'blunts' (arrows with rubber caps on the front instead of a pile), the object being to dislodge any one of a number of wooden 'birds'. These birds must be one Cock, four Hens, and a minimum of twenty-four Chicks. A Cock scores 5 points when hit and knocked off its perch; a Hen, 3; and a Chick, 1 point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto''' ([[February 3]], [[1898]] - [[May 11]], [[1976]]) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[architect]] and [[designer]].  He was generally known as '''Alvar Aalto'''.

He was noted for his humanistic approach and for being one of the first and the most influential architects of [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] [[modernism]], so much so that he is sometimes known as the &quot;Father of Modernism&quot; in Scandinavia.  His work includes [[architecture]], [[furniture]] and [[glassware]].  

He was a member of the [[Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]]. Major works include the [[Finlandia Hall]] in [[Helsinki]], Finland, and the campus of [[Helsinki University of Technology]].  Aalto's glassware includes the world-famous [[Aalto Vase]]. 

He is the [[eponym]] of the [[Alvar Aalto Medal]], now considered one of world architecture’s most prestigious awards.

== Life and works ==
&lt;!-- This page badly needs more material.  The London Design Museum article might provide some starting points.  http://www.designmuseum.org/designerex/alvar-aalto.htm --&gt;
Alvar Aalto was born in [[Kuortane]], [[Finland]].  He studied architecture at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] from [[1916]] to [[1921]].  He returned to [[Jyväskylä]], where he opened his first architectural office in [[1923]]. The following year he married architect [[Aino Aalto|Aino Marsio]]. Their honeymoon journey to [[Italy]] sealed an intellectual bond with the culture of the [[Mediterranean]] region that was to remain important to Aalto for the rest of his life.

Aalto's wide field of activity ranged from [[furniture]] and [[glassware]] designs to [[architecture]] and [[painting]]. His vase designs are world-famous.  Aalto furniture is manufactured by [[Artek (company)|Artek]], a company Aalto co-founded.  Aalto glassware (Aino as well as Alvar) is manufactured by [[iittala]].

&lt;!-- and for gods sake discuss his design work.  some diagrams would be in order --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!--Please be aware that the usage of a mixture of American and Commonwealth English in this article is deliberate.--&gt;
This article outlines the differences between '''[[American English]]''', the [[variety (linguistics)|form]] of the [[English language]] spoken in the [[United States]], and '''[[Commonwealth English]]''' (often called '''[[British English]]''').

For the purposes of this article:
* '''American English''' is the form of English used by people in the United States and, as a lingua franca or second language, by people in many parts of the world. American English does not include [[Canadian English]]; although Canadian pronunciation and vocabulary is very similar to that of the United States, Canadian spelling often takes the Commonwealth form. Regions and countries that tend to use American English in teaching and publishing include much of the [[East Asia]] (especially [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[Philippines]]; although largely excluding the former British colonies of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]]), the [[Americas]] (excluding other former British colonies such as [[Canada]], [[Jamaica]], and the [[Bahamas]]) and, in Africa, [[Liberia]]. The [[World Bank]], and the [[Organization of American States]], among other organizations, also use American English.
* '''Commonwealth English''' is the form of English used across the [[United Kingdom]] and most of its former colonies in the [[British Empire]], most notably in much of [[Africa]] (including [[South Africa]] and [[Egypt]]), the [[Indian subcontinent]] ([[Pakistan]], [[India]], and [[Bangladesh]]), [[Malta]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and portions of [[Southeast Asia]] ([[Myanmar]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Thailand]]), as well as [[Hong Kong]]. It is the first language of the vast majority of the inhabitants of [[Ireland]]. Like American English, it is used in many parts of the world as a lingua franca. This form of English, mostly interchangeable with British English, is sometimes called Commonwealth English because most of its speakers live in nations that are members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Other nations and groups that use British English include the [[European Union]] and, often, the [[United Nations]]. Many international organizations, like the [[International Olympic Committee]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] also use British English. All Middle Eastern Countries, except Israel, use British English. 
* The forms of English spoken in [[Canadian English|Canada]] exhibit features of both British and American dialects; while spelling is closer to British English, pronunciation and vocabulary are much closer to American English.  Many words and phrases thought of as &quot;[[Americanism (general)|Americanisms]]&quot; are also used by Canadians.
* Although '''British English''' is a term used when describing formal ''written'' English used in the United Kingdom, the forms of ''spoken'' English used in the United Kingdom vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world in which English is spoken, even more than in the United States, despite the vastly larger population and land area of the U.S. Dialects and accents vary not only between regions of the UK — for example, in [[Scottish English|Scotland]], [[Mid-Ulster English|Northern Ireland]], and [[Wales]] — but also within England, with differences occurring within the space of a few miles in some cases.  [[Northern Ireland]] has the most numerous accents for such a small area, and different accents can even be detected from different areas of certain towns.  The written form of the language universally taught in schools is Commonwealth English with a slight emphasis on a few words which might be more common in the specific areas than others. For example, although the words &quot;wee&quot; and &quot;small&quot; are interchangeable, one is more likely to see &quot;wee&quot; written by a Scot than by a Londoner.

Although spoken American and British English are generally mutually intelligible, there are enough differences to occasionally cause awkward misunderstandings or even a complete failure to communicate. [[George Bernard Shaw]] once said that the United States and United Kingdom are &quot;two countries divided by a common language&quot;; a similar comment is ascribed to [[Winston Churchill]]. [[Henry Sweet]] predicted in 1877 that within a century, American English, Australian English and British English would be mutually unintelligible, but it may be the case that increased world-wide communication through [[radio]], [[television]], the [[Internet]], and [[globalization]] has reduced the tendency to regional variation. This can result either in some variations becoming extinct (as, for instance, ''[[Truck (disambiguation)|truck]]'' has been gradually replacing ''[[lorry]]'' in much of the world) or in the acceptance of wide variations as &quot;perfectly good English&quot; everywhere.

In addition to its use in [[List of countries by English speaking population|English-speaking countries]], English plays an important role as a technical language around the world, in medicine, computer science, air traffic control, and many other areas of concentrated expertise and formal communication among international professionals.

==Pronunciation==
:''See: [[American and British English pronunciation differences]]''

==Grammar==
===Singular and plural for nouns===
* In British English, singular nouns that describe multiple people are often treated as plural, particularly where one is concerned with the people constituting the team, rather than with the team as an entity.  The singular form is usually used in American.  For example, British &quot;the team are worried&quot;; American &quot;the team is worried&quot;. Americans may use the plural form when the individual membership is clear, for example, &quot;the team take their seats&quot; (not &quot;the team takes its seat(s)&quot;), although it is often rephrased to avoid the singular/plural decision, as in &quot;the team members take their seats&quot;. The difference occurs for all collective nouns, both general terms such as ''team'' and ''company'' and [[proper noun]]s (for example, where a place name is used to refer to a sports team). Proper nouns which are plural in form take a plural verb in both American and British English.  Examples:
** British English: &quot;The Clash are a well-known band.&quot; American English: &quot;The Clash is a well-known band.&quot; Both: &quot;The Beatles are a well-known band.&quot;
** British English: &quot;New England are the champions.&quot; American English: &quot;New England is the champion.&quot;  Both: &quot;The [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] are the champions&quot;.
* Differences in which nouns are the same in both their plural and singular forms, such as the word ''sheep''. In American English, ''shrimp'' is such a word, but in British English the plural of ''shrimp'' is ''shrimps''.  (''Shrimps'' is occasionally heard in the southern U.S., but is otherwise rare, apart from its colloquial use as a pejorative term for small people). An unusual example is ''[[innings]]'', which is both singular and plural in British English, but for which a separate singular form (''inning'') exists in American English.

===Use of tenses===
* British English uses the [[grammatical tense|present perfect tense]] to talk about an event in the recent past and with the words ''already'', ''just'' and ''yet.'' In American usage, these meanings can be expressed with the present perfect or the simple past.
** &quot;Have you cleaned your teeth?&quot; / &quot;Did you clean your teeth?&quot;
** &quot;Have you done your homework yet?&quot; / &quot;Did you do your homework yet?&quot;
** &quot;I've just got home.&quot; / &quot;I just got home.&quot;
** &quot;I've already eaten.&quot; / &quot;I already ate.&quot;
* Similarly, the [[pluperfect tense|pluperfect]] is occasionally replaced by the [[preterite]] in the USA; this is generally regarded as sloppy usage by those Americans who consider themselves careful users of the language.
* In British English, ''have got'' or ''have'' can be used for possession and ''have got to'' and ''have to'' can be used for the modal of necessity. The forms which include ''got'' are usually used in informal contexts and the forms without ''got'' in more formal contexts. In American speech the form without ''got'' is used more than in the UK. American also informally uses ''got'' as a verb for these meanings, ''e.g.'' &quot;I got two cars,&quot; &quot;I got to go&quot;; but these are nonstandard and will be considered sloppy usage by many American speakers.
* The [[subjunctive mood]] is more common in American English in expressions such as: &quot;They suggested that he apply for the job&quot;. British English would have &quot;They suggested that he should apply for the job&quot; (or even &quot;They suggested that he applied for the job&quot;). However, the British usage (&quot;should apply&quot;) is also heard in the United States.

===Verb morphology===
: ''See also: [[wiktionary:Wiktionary_Appendix:Irregular_Verbs|the list of irregular verbs]]''

* Verb past tenses with ''-ed'': Americans tend to use ''dreamed'', ''leaped'', ''learned'', ''spelled''; Commonwealth more commonly uses ''dreamt'', ''leapt'', ''learnt'', ''spelt'', particularly if the speaker uses [[Received Pronunciation]]. As with the &quot;tre&quot; words, the ''t'' endings are often found in older American texts. The forms with ''-ed'' are also common in Commonwealth usage, and preferred by many careful writers of English since they are [[weak verb|regular verbs]]. (Note that the two-syllable form ''learnèd'' {{IPA|/'l&amp;#604;&amp;#720;n&amp;#618;d/}}, usually written simply as ''learned'', is still used as an adjective to mean &quot;educated&quot;, or to refer to academic institutions, in both British English and American English.)
* Other verb past tense forms: Americans more frequently use the irregular forms ''fit'', ''forecast'', ''knit'', ''lit'', ''wed''; the weak forms ''fitted'', ''forecasted'', ''knitted'', ''lighted'', ''wedded'' are more common in Commonwealth use. The distinction is, however, not rigorous as the Commonwealth forms are also found in American, and both ''lit'' and ''forecast'' are not only found in Commonwealth English, but are generally considered standard usage.
* Also, the past participle ''gotten'' is rarely used in modern British English (although it is used in some dialects), which generally uses ''got'' (as do some Americans), except in old expressions such as ''ill-gotten gains''. Commonwealth usage retains the form ''forgotten'', though. Furthermore, according to the Compact Oxford English Dictionary, &quot;The form ''gotten'' is not used in British English but is very common in North American English, though even there it is often regarded as non-standard.&quot;  In North America, most people who use ''gotten'' also use ''got'', with ''gotten'' emphasizing the action of acquiring, and ''got'' tending to indicate simple possession (''Have you gotten it?'', as an example).  
* The past participle ''proven'' is frequently used in American English, although some speakers avoid it, and it remains ''proved'' in British English (except in adjectival use; and usage is different in [[Scots law]]).
* American English further allows other irregular verbs, such as &lt;!--''thrive'' (''throve''&amp;ndash;''thriven'') or --&gt;''dive'' (''dove'') or ''sneak'' (''snuck''), which remain regular in Commonwealth English, and often mixes the preterite and past participle forms (''spring''&amp;ndash;''sprang'' (U.S. also ''sprung'')&amp;ndash;''sprung''), sometimes forcing verbs such as ''shrink'' (''shrank''&amp;ndash;''shrunk'') to have a further form, thus ''shrunk''&amp;ndash;''shrunken''. (These uses are often considered nonstandard; the [[Associated Press Stylebook]] in American English treats some irregular verbs as colloquialisms, insisting on the regular forms for the past tense of ''dive'', ''plead'' and ''sneak''.)

===Presence or absence of syntactic elements===
* Where a statement of intention involves two separate activities, it is acceptable for speakers of American English to use ''to go'' plus bare infinitive. Speakers of British English would instead use ''to go '''and''''' plus bare infinitive: thus where a speaker of American English might say &quot;I'll go take a bath&quot;, British English speakers would say &quot;I'll go ''and'' have a bath&quot;.  (Both can also use the form &quot;to go to&quot; instead to suggest that the action may fail, as in &quot;He went to take/have a bath, but the bath was full of children.&quot;)  Similarly, ''to come'' plus bare infinitive is acceptable to speakers of American English, where speakers of British English would instead use ''to come '''and''''' plus bare infinitive:  thus where a speaker of American English might say ''Come see what I bought'', British English speakers would say, ''Come and see what I've bought'' (notice the addition of &quot;have&quot;: a common British preference).
* Use of prepositions before days denoted by a single word. Where [[British]] people would say &quot;She resigned on Thursday&quot;, Americans often say &quot;She resigned Thursday&quot;, but both forms are common in American usage.  Occasionally, the preposition is also absent when referring to months: &quot;I'll be here December&quot; (although this usage is generally limited to colloquial speech).
* In the UK, ''from'' is used with single dates and times more often than in the United States. Where British speakers and writers may say &quot;the new museum will be open from Tuesday,&quot; Americans always say &quot;the new museum will be open starting Tuesday&quot;, and would probably be confused by the British saying. (This difference does not apply to phrases of the pattern ''from A to B'', which are used in both British and American English.) A variation or alternative of this is the American &quot;the play opens Tuesday&quot; and the British &quot;the play opens on Tuesday&quot;.
* Where an American will ''meet with'' someone, a British person can ''meet'' someone.  To a British person, the use of ''with'' seems to reinforce a notion of mutuality (in this case, the usage is similar to ''to have a meeting with someone''). 
* The verb ''visit'' is often used intransitively in American English, with possibly the additional meaning of &quot;to have a conversation&quot; (as in &quot;to visit with a friend&quot;, a construction that often sounds strange to British ears). 
* In British English, the indirect object of the verb &quot;to write&quot; usually requires the preposition &quot;to&quot;, e.g. &quot;I'll write '''to''' my MP&quot; or &quot;I'll write '''to''' her&quot; (although it is not required in some situations, for example when an indirect object pronoun comes before a direct object noun, e.g. &quot;I'll write '''her''' a letter&quot;). In American English, the &quot;to&quot; can be omitted in many circumstances, e.g. &quot;I'll write my congressman&quot; or &quot;I'll write him&quot;.
* Intransitive verbs often become transitive in American English; for example, British English: &quot;The workers protested against the decision.&quot; American English: &quot;The workers protested the decision.&quot;
* A few 'institutional' nouns take no [[definite article]] when a certain role is implied: for example, &quot;at sea&quot; (as a sailor), &quot;in prison&quot; (as a convict), and &quot;at university&quot; (for British students) or &quot;at/in college&quot; (for American students). Among this group, Commonwealth English has &quot;in [[hospital]]&quot; (as a patient), where American English requires ''in '''the''' hospital''. (A nurse, visitor, etc. would be &quot;in the hospital&quot; in both systems, as the implied role (of patient) does not apply.)
*American English distinguishes ''in back of'' [behind] from ''in '''the''' back of''; the former is unknown in the UK and liable to misinterpretation as the latter.  Both however distinguish ''in front of'' from ''in the front of''.
* American [[legislator]]s and [[lawyer]]s always use the preposition &quot;of&quot; between the name of a legislative act and the year it was passed, while their British equivalents do not.  Compare ''[[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]'' to ''[[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]]''.

===Different prepositions in certain contexts===
* In the United States, the word ''through'' can mean &quot;up to and including&quot; as in ''Monday through Friday''. In the UK ''Monday to Friday'', or ''Monday to Friday inclusive'' is used instead; ''Monday through to Friday'' is also sometimes used. (In some parts of Northern England the term ''while'' can be used in the same way, as in ''Monday while Friday'', whereas in Northern Ireland ''Monday till Friday'' would be more natural.)
* In American English, &quot;in&quot; is never used to describe which street one lives in, whereas in British English &quot;in&quot; is sometimes used when describing a certain place in the street. For example, in British usage one would always live &quot;on Churchill Road&quot;, but might also live &quot;in the middle of Churchill Road&quot;. Thus the lyric &quot;our house, in the middle of our street&quot; from &quot;Our House&quot; by the British band [[Madness (band)|Madness]] is confusing to many Americans. Note that the use of &quot;on&quot; and &quot;in&quot; in British English depends on where the house is; one doesn't live &quot;in the end of Churchill Road&quot;, nor lives &quot;in the corner&quot;
* After ''talk'' American can use the preposition ''with'' but British always uses ''to'' (i.e. &quot;I'll talk with Dave / I'll talk to Dave&quot;. The American form is sometimes seen as more [[politically correct]] in British organisations, inducing the ideal of discussing (with), as opposed to lecturing (to). This is, of course, unless talk is being used as a noun, for example: &quot;I'll have a talk with him&quot; in which case this is acceptable in both British and American English.
* In American English ''from'' is the preposition prescribed for use after the word ''different'': &quot;American English is different from British English in several respects.&quot;  While considered technically incorrect by prescriptionists, ''different than'' is also commonly heard in the US.  The British phrasing ''different to'', however, is almost entirely unknown in the US. When grammar is taught formally in the UK, both ''different than'' and ''different to'' are regarded as incorrect, whereas ''different from'' is considered correct by those who subscribe to grammatical [[Prescription and description|prescription]].
* It is common in British English to say ''opposite to''. American English uses ''opposite of''.

===Miscellaneous grammatical differences===
* In American English there is a normative rule which says that, for a non-human antecedent, ''which'' should not be used in [[Restrictive clause|restrictive relative clauses]]. According to ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' (p. 59), &quot;''That'' is the defining, or restrictive pronoun, ''which'' the nondefining, or nonrestrictive. See Rule 3.&quot;
* In names of American rivers, the word ''river'' usually comes after the name (for example, ''[[Colorado River]]''), whereas for British rivers it comes before (as in ''[[River Thames]]'').  One exception present in British English is the ''[[Fleet River]]'', which is rarely called the ''River Fleet'' by [[Londoner]]s outside of official documentation. An exception in the U.S. is the ''[[River Raisin]]'' in [[Michigan]] named by the French.
* In British English the word ''sat'' is often colloquially used to cover ''sat'', ''sitting'' and ''seated'': &quot;I've been sat here waiting for half an hour.&quot; &quot;The bride's family will be sat on the right side of the church.&quot; This construction is not often heard outside the UK. In the 1960s, its use would mark a speaker as coming from the north of England but by the turn of the 21st century this form had spread to the south. Its use often conveys lighthearted informality, as many speakers intentionally use an ungrammatical construction they would probably not use in [[Formal written English|formal written English]].  This colloquial usage is widely understood by British speakers. Similarly ''stood'' can be used instead of ''standing''.  To an American these usages may imply that the subject had been involuntarily forced to sit or stand.
* In most areas of the United States, the word ''with'' is also used as an adverb: &quot;I'll come with&quot; instead of &quot;I'll come along&quot;.  However, in some British Dialects, 'come with' is used as an abbreviation of 'come with me', as in &quot;I'm going to the office - come with&quot; instead of &quot;I'm going to the office - come with me&quot;.

==Word derivation and compounds==
* Directional suffix ''-ward(s)'': British ''forwards'', ''towards'', ''rightwards'', etc.; American ''forward'', ''toward'', ''rightward''.  The forms with ''-s'' are only used as adverbs or prepositions in American English, though ''-s'' forms are becoming less common save for ''afterwards''. In British English, there is a semantic difference in the usage of the two possible forms.  The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' states the following about ''forward'' and ''forwards'': &quot;/.../ the latter expresses a definite direction viewed in contrast with other directions. In some contexts either form may be used without perceptible difference of meaning; the following are examples in which only one of them can be used: 'The ratchet-wheel can move only ''forwards''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;; 'the right side of the paper has the maker's name reading ''forwards''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;; 'if you move at all it must be ''forwards''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;; 'my companion has gone ''forward''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;; 'to bring a matter ''forward''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;; 'from this time ''forward''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&quot;
* Commonwealth English allows agentive ''-er'' suffix for ''[[football]]'' (also ''[[cricket]]''; often ''[[netball]]''; occasionally ''[[basketball]]'').  American English always uses ''football player'' rather than ''footballer''.  Where the sport's name is usable as a verb, the suffixation is standard in both American English and British English: for example, ''[[golf]]er'', ''[[Ten-pin_bowling|bowler]]'', and ''[[Shooting_sports|shooter]]''.
* English writers everywhere occasionally make new compound words from common phrases; for example, ''health care'' is now being replaced by ''healthcare'' on both sides of the Atlantic.  However, American English has made certain words in this fashion which are still treated as phrases in most Commonwealth countries.  For example, Americans write &quot;trademarks,&quot; but some other countries write &quot;trade-marks&quot; or &quot;trade marks.&quot;
* In [[English_compound#Compound_nouns|compound noun]]s of the form &lt;verb&gt;&amp;lt;noun&gt;, sometimes American English favours the [[Infinitive#Bare_infinitive|bare infinitive]] where British English favours the [[gerund]].  Examples include: ''[[jump rope|jump&amp;nbsp;rope]]'' / ''skipping&amp;nbsp;rope''; ''racecar'' / ''racing&amp;nbsp;car''; ''rowboat'' / ''rowing&amp;nbsp;boat''; ''sailboat'' / ''sailing&amp;nbsp;boat''.  In each of these pairs, the former term is more common in America than the UK and the latter more common in the UK than America (although it is not necessarily the case that the former is more common than the latter within America or the latter more common than the former within the UK).
* Singular attributives in one country may be plural in the other, and ''vice versa''. For example, the UK has a ''drugs problem'' while the United States has a ''drug problem'' (although the singular usage is also commonly heard in the UK); Americans read the &quot;[[Sports]]&quot; section of a newspaper, while the British read the &quot;Sport&quot; section.

==Lexis==
Most of the differences are in connection with concepts originating from the [[nineteenth century]] to the mid [[twentieth century]], where new words were coined independently; almost the entire vocabularies of the [[automobile|car/automobile]] and [[railway|railway/railroad]] industries (see [[Rail terminology]]) are different between the UK and America, for example.  Other sources of difference are slang or vulgar terms, where frequent new coinage occurs, and idiomatic phrases, including phrasal verbs. The differences most likely to create confusion are those where the same word or phrase is used for two different concepts. Regional variations even within the U.S. or the UK can create the same problems.

Generally, American words can be freely interchanged with their British versions within the [[United Kingdom]] and English-speaking Commonwealth nations, without leading to confusion, though this may cause irritation. The reverse situation causes worse problems. However, there are some exceptions, such as  ''gas'' (as in ''gasoline''), and ''stroller'' (in the sense of ''pushchair'') which would be misunderstood by speakers of British English, as well as common trademark names unknown in the other country, such as ''Dumpster'' (U.S.) or ''Sellotape'' (UK). There are, however, many pitfalls that Americans can fall into without realising it; for example, referring to a woman's ''fanny'' in the UK, since the word indicates the buttocks in the U.S. but the vagina in the UK. Speakers of Commonwealth English should be cautious when asking for a ''[[fag]]'' (cigarette) in America, as it is a derogatory term referring to a homosexual in the U.S., although nowadays these alternate meanings are understood in the UK as their U.S. version, dependent on context. Residents of [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]] beaches should be wary of inviting their British guests to &quot;go out [[Carolina shag|shagging]],&quot; (a type of dance), for the term in British English refers to sexual intercourse. This meaning has become commonly known in the U.S., however, owing to its repeated usage in the popular [[Austin Powers]] films, so many or most Americans are not likely to approach with such an offer unless that is what is in mind. Similarly, avoid telling Australians or New Zealanders what team you ''root'' for, as the slang meaning of &quot;root&quot; in these countries is sexual intercourse.

===General trends===
While the use of American expressions in British English is often noted in the UK, movement in the opposite direction is less common. But recent examples exist, including the idiom &quot;to go missing,&quot; which had been a distinctively British expression but is used increasingly in American English, at least in journalism. The noun &quot;queue&quot; also seems to be making inroads in the U.S. as well. (The usual American equivalents of &quot;to go missing&quot; and &quot;queue&quot; are &quot;to disappear&quot; and &quot;line&quot;, respectively.) Also, the spelling of 'travelling' and 'traveller' and 'judgement' through observations appear to be creeping into American English.

===Words mainly used in British English===
:''See also: [[List of words mainly used in British English]]''

Speakers of American English are likely to be aware of some British English terms, such as ''lorry'', ''biscuit'', ''chap'', and ''shag'' although they would not generally use them, or may be confused as to whether one means the American or British meaning of some (such as ''biscuit''). They will be able to guess approximately what is meant by some others, such as ''driving licence''. However, use of many other British words, such as ''naff'' (unstylish) or ''busk'' (to play a musical instrument in public with the hope of getting donations from passers-by), risks rendering a sentence incomprehensible to most Americans.

===Words mainly used in American English===
: ''See also: [[List of words mainly used in American English]]''

Speakers of British English are likely to be aware of some American English terms, such as ''sidewalk'', ''gas'', ''cookie'', ''elevator'' although they would not generally use them. They will be able to guess approximately what is meant by some others, such as ''cotton candy''. However, use of some other American words risks rendering a sentence incomprehensible to most British people.

Note that, largely through the influence of [[Hollywood]], the chance of a given Americanism being understood by a British person is significantly greater than in the reverse case.  However, Americans who watch [[britcom|britcoms]] and other imported BBC programs and British news re-broadcasts on American public television ([[PBS]]) are more likely to be familiar with British usages than those who do not.

* ''Fitted'' is used in both conventions as an adjective (&quot;fitted sheets&quot; are the same size as the mattress) and as the past tense of ''fit'' (&quot;to suffer epilepsy&quot;, for example, &quot;Leavitt fitted&quot; in ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]''); however ''fit'' and ''fitting'' do not denote [[epileptic seizure]] in ordinary British use (though that usage is common within medical circles), as the same effect is achieved by ''to have a fit'' or ''to throw a fit''.

===Words with differing meanings===
: ''See: [[List of words having different meanings in British and American English]]''

===Words which have become archaic in one dialect===
* In Southern Britain the word ''whilst'' is used almost interchangeably with ''while'' and ''whilst'' is the more common term. ''Whilst'' is more often used in instruction manuals, legal documents, etc.  To Americans the word ''whilst'', in any context, seems very archaic or pretentious or both.  The words ''amidst'' (as opposed to ''amid''), and to a lesser extent ''amongst'' (as opposed to ''among'') are also rarer in American English. (&quot;In the midst&quot; is a standard idiom in both).

* In the UK generally the term &quot;fall&quot; used in the context of the seasons became obsolete and was replaced by the word &quot;Autumn&quot;. Although archaic, found often in [[Elizabethan]] and [[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] literature, understanding of the word is usually ascribed to its continued use in America.

*In the UK the term &quot;period&quot; for a &quot;full stop&quot; is now obsolete, even when used as a phrase, such as &quot;Don't do that. Period.&quot; This in itself, though, is likely to be an American import. The phrase &quot;Don't do that. Full stop.&quot; is often preferred to &quot;period&quot;, as shown by the [[NSPCC]] Full Stop campaign.

===Numbers===
:''See also: [[Names of numbers in English]]''

When saying or writing out numbers, the British will insert an &quot;and&quot; before the tens and units, as in &quot;one hundred and sixty-two&quot; and &quot;two thousand and three&quot;, whereas Americans will typically drop the &quot;and&quot; as in &quot;two thousand three&quot;; however, &quot;two thousand and three&quot; is also common. The same rule applies when saying numbers in their thousands or millions: &quot;four hundred and thirteen thousand&quot; would be said by a British speaker, whereas the simpler &quot;four hundred thirteen thousand&quot; by an American speaker.

Some American schools teach that &quot;and&quot; indicates the [[decimal point]]: thus, numbers preceding &quot;and&quot; are [[integers]], while the numbers following &quot;and&quot; are [[fraction|fractional]] (e.g. five hundred thirteen and seven tenths for 513.7). Americans are more likely than the British to read numbers like 1,234 as &quot;twelve thirty-four&quot;, instead of &quot;one thousand, two hundred and thirty-four&quot; unless discussing the year 1234, when &quot;twelve thirty-four&quot; would be the norm on both sides of the Atlantic (note that British speakers do not say &quot;and&quot; before the tens or units when talking about a year, except for years &quot;two thousand and ...&quot;). The year 2000 and beyond are read as &quot;two thousand&quot; rather than &quot;twenty hundred&quot; by both British and American speakers, but years beyond 2100 may be read as &quot;twenty-one hundred&quot; or &quot;two thousand one hundred&quot;. 

Similarly, for the house number (or bus number, etc) &quot;272&quot; British people would tend to say &quot;two seven two&quot; while Americans would tend to say &quot;two seventy-two&quot;. Between 1100 and 1900 the British commonly read numbers ending in round hundreds as, for instance, &quot;sixteen hundred&quot; instead of &quot;one thousand six hundred&quot;, but from 2000 upwards usage like &quot;thirty-two hundred&quot; would be replaced by &quot;three thousand two hundred&quot;.

There was also a historical difference between [[billion]]s, [[trillion]]s, and so forth. Americans use &quot;billion&quot; to mean one thousand million (1,000,000,000), whereas in the UK, until the latter part of the 20th century, it was almost exclusively used to mean one million million (1,000,000,000,000), with one thousand million sometimes described as a &quot;[[milliard]]&quot;, the definition adopted by most other European languages. However, the &quot;American English&quot; version has since been adopted for all published writing, and the word &quot;milliard&quot; is obsolete in English, as are billiard (but not [[billiards]]), trilliard and so on.

Nevertheless, the majority of people have no direct experience with manipulating numbers this large, so a significant proportion of international readers will interpret &quot;billion&quot; as 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, even if they are young enough to have been taught otherwise at school. For this reason, defining the word may be advisable when writing for the general public. However, all major British publications and broadcasters, including the [[BBC]], which long used &quot;thousand million&quot; to avoid ambiguity, now use &quot;billion&quot; to mean thousand million.

See [[long and short scales]] for a more detailed discussion of the evolution of these terms in English and other languages.

Finally, when referring to the numeral [[0 (number)|0]], British people would use &quot;zero&quot;, &quot;nought&quot;, or &quot;oh&quot; normally, or &quot;nil&quot; in instances such as sports scores and voting results. Americans use the term &quot;zero&quot; most frequently; &quot;oh&quot; is also often used, and occasionally slang terms such as &quot;zilch&quot; or &quot;zip&quot;. Phrases such as &quot;the team won two-zip&quot; or &quot;the team leads the series, two-nothing&quot; are heard when reporting sports scores. The digit 0, for example, when reading a phone or account number aloud, is nearly always pronounced &quot;oh&quot; in both languages for the sake of convenience.

When reading numbers in a sequence, such as a telephone or serial number, British people will use the terms ''double'' or ''triple/treble''. Hence 007 is &quot;double oh seven&quot;.  Exceptions are the emergency telephone number [[9-9-9|999]], which is always &quot;nine nine nine&quot; and the apocalyptic &quot;[[Number of the Beast]]&quot; which is always &quot;six six six&quot;. The [[directory enquiries]] prefix 118 is also &quot;one one eight&quot; due to its extensive advertising campaign with the slogan read out as &quot;One one eight, what's your number?&quot;. In the US, [[9-1-1|911]] (the US emergency telephone number) is almost always read &quot;nine-one-one&quot;, while 9-11 ([[September 11, 2001 attacks|September&amp;nbsp;11, 2001]]) is usually read &quot;nine-eleven&quot;.

===Levels of buildings===
There are also variations in [[floor numbering]] between the U.S. and U.K. &amp;mdash; in most countries, including the UK, the &quot;first floor&quot; is one above the entrance level while the entrance level is the &quot;ground floor&quot;; whereas normal American usage labels the entrance level as the &quot;first floor&quot; and does not use &quot;ground floor.&quot;  Some American buildings have a &quot;ground floor&quot; or another name for the entrance level, usually as part of a plan to cater to [[cosmopolitan]] persons.  (This may also be the case in buildings built on hillsides or uneven ground, where the basement on one side of the structure may be at street level on the other.) Nonetheless, the rest of the floors are numbered in the usual American manner.

===Figures of speech===
Both British English and American English use the expression &quot;I couldn't care less&quot; to mean the speaker does not care at all. In American English, the phrase &quot;I could care less&quot; (without the &quot;n't&quot;) is synonymous with this in casual usage. [[Intonation]] no longer reflects the originally [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] nature of this variant, which is not [[idiom]]atic in British English and might be interpreted as anything from nonsense to an indication that the speaker ''does'' care.

In both areas, saying &quot;I don't mind&quot; often means &quot;I'm not annoyed&quot; (for example, by someone's smoking), while &quot;I don't care&quot; often means &quot;the matter is trivial or boring&quot;.  However, in answering a question like &quot;Tea or coffee?&quot;, if either alternative is equally acceptable, an American may answer &quot;I don't care&quot;, while a British person may answer &quot;I don't mind&quot;.  Either sounds odd to the other.

===Business===
In his history of the Second World War, [[Winston Churchill]] records that differences in the interpretation of the verb &quot;to table&quot; caused an argument between British and American planners. The British wanted a matter ''tabled'' immediately because it was important, and the Americans insisted it should not be tabled at all because it was important. In British English, the term means &quot;to discuss now&quot; (the issue is ''brought to'' the table), whereas in American English it means &quot;to defer&quot; (the issue is ''left on'' the table).

In a similar vein, the verb &quot;to slate&quot; means &quot;to schedule&quot; in the U.S. but (informally) &quot;to disparage&quot; in the UK. Thus a headline such as &quot;Third Harry Potter Film Slated&quot; has two very different interpretations.

One usage of the word &quot;bomb&quot; causes similar confusion: in the U.S. &quot;the show bombed&quot; means it was a total failure; in the UK &quot;the show went down a bomb&quot; means it was a great success.  The American slang phrase &quot;the bomb,&quot; however (perhaps inspired by [[African American Vernacular English]]), almost always indicates positivity.  For example, the phrase, &quot;That show was the bomb,&quot; would mean that the show was outstanding.  In this usage, the article &quot;the&quot; will sometimes be pronounced &quot;da&quot;, and sometimes would be written &quot;That show was da bomb&quot;, indicating a dialect pronunciation of the word &quot;the&quot;.

===Education===
In the UK, a student is said to &quot;read&quot; or to &quot;study&quot; a subject, while in the U.S., a student either &quot;studies&quot; the subject or &quot;majors&quot; in it.  Unlike most of the world where university students pursue a single field of study, United States universities often require a variety of courses.  &quot;To major&quot; refers only to the student's principal course of study, while &quot;to study&quot; may be refer to any class being taken.

British English:

:&quot;She read history at Oxford&quot;.

American English:

:&quot;She majored in history at Yale.&quot;

In the UK, a student &quot;revises&quot; or &quot;does revision&quot; for an examination, while in American English, the student &quot;studies&quot; for it. When &quot;taking&quot; or &quot;writing&quot; the examination, a student in the UK would have that examination supervised by an &quot;invigilator&quot; whereas in American English it would be a &quot;proctor&quot; (or merely &quot;(exam) supervisor&quot;).

In the UK, a student is said to &quot;sit&quot; or &quot;take&quot; an exam, while in the U.S., a student &quot;takes&quot; an exam.  In the UK, a teacher &quot;sets&quot; an exam, while in the U.S., a teacher &quot;writes&quot; or &quot;gives&quot; an exam.  The expression &quot;he sits for&quot; an exam also arises in British English, but only rarely in American English; American lawyers-to-be &quot;sit for&quot; their bar exams, and American master's and doctoral students may &quot;sit for&quot; their comprehensive exams, but in nearly all other instances, Americans &quot;take&quot; their exams.

British English:

:&quot;I sat my Spanish exam yesterday.&quot;
:&quot;I plan to set a difficult exam for my students, but I haven't got it ready yet.&quot;

American English:

:&quot;I took my exams at Yale.&quot;
:&quot;I spent the entire day yesterday writing the exam.  At last, it's ready for my students.&quot;

Another source of confusion is the different usage of the word ''college''.  In the U.S., this refers to a post-high school institution such as a university, whilst in the UK and most Commonwealth countries it refers primarily to a tertiary institution between high school and university (normally referred to as a &quot;Sixth Form College&quot; after the old name in secondary education for Years 12 and 13, the &quot;6th form&quot;) where intermediary courses such as [[A Level]]s or [[NVQ]]s can be taken and [[GCSE]] courses can be retaken, with the interchangeability of college with high school being rare but not unknown.  Americans may be surprised to hear of a 14 year old attending college in the UK, mistakenly assuming it is at the university level. It should be noted however, that in the case of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities, all members are also members of a college. eg one is a member of [[St. Peter's College, Oxford]] and hence the University. 

In both the U.S. and UK, ''college'' can refer to some division within a university such as a &quot;college of mathematics and science&quot;. Institutions in the U.S. that offer two to four years of post-high school education often have the word ''college'' as part of their name, while those offering more advanced degrees are called a ''university''.  American students who pursue a ''bachelor's degree'' (four years of higher education) or an ''associate's degree'' (two years of higher education) are &quot;college students&quot; regardless of whether they attend a college or a university and refer to their educational institutions informally as ''colleges.''  However, a student who pursues a master's degree or a doctorate degree in the arts and sciences is a &quot;graduate student.&quot;  Students of advanced professional programmes are known by their field (business student, law student, journalism student).  

Among high school and college students in the United States, the words ''freshman'' (or the gender neutral term ''frosh''), ''sophomore'', ''junior'' and ''senior'' refer to the first, second, third, and fourth year respectively. It is important that the context of either high school or college first be established, or else it must be stated directly (that is, &quot;She is a high school freshman.&quot;  &quot;He is a college junior.&quot;).  Many institutions in both countries also use the term &quot;first-year&quot; as a gender-neutral replacement for &quot;freshman&quot;.  In the UK, first year university students are often called ''freshers''; however, there are no specific names for those in other years, nor for school pupils.  Graduate and professional students in the United States are known by their year of study (a &quot;second year medical student&quot; or a &quot;fifth year doctoral candidate&quot;).

In the UK, the US equivalent of a ''high school'' is often referred to as a ''secondary school'' regardless of whether it is public or private.  Secondary education in the United States also includes ''middle school'' or ''junior high school'', a two or three year transitional school between elementary school and high school.  A ''public school'' has opposite meanings in the two countries.  In the US this is a government owned institution supported by taxpayers.  In the UK it is an independent institution funded by tuition.  The United States uses several additional terms for specific types of secondary schools.  A ''prep school'' or ''preparatory school'' is an independent school funded by tuition.  A ''parochial school'' covers costs through tuition and has affiliation with a religious institution.  A ''magnet school'' receives government funding and has special admission requirements.  Students gain admission through superior performance on admission tests.

===Transport===
Americans refer to ''transportation,'' while British people refer to ''transport.''  

Differences in terminology are especially obvious in the context of [[road]]s.  The British term ''dual carriageway'', in American parlance, would be a ''divided highway''.  ''Central reservation'' on a ''motorway'' in the UK would be a ''median'' on a ''freeway'' or ''expressway'' in the U.S.  The one-way lanes that make it possible to enter and leave such roads at an intermediate point without disrupting the flow of traffic are generally known as ''slip roads'' in the UK, but U.S. civil engineers call them ''ramps,'' and further distinguish between ''on-ramps'' (for entering) or ''off-ramps'' (for leaving).  When American engineers speak of ''slip roads,'' or ''slip ramps,'' they are referring to on-ramps and off-ramps that have been rearranged (through use of a [[grade separation]]) to minimize weaving on a freeway segment between two interchanges that are too close together.  

In the UK, the term ''outside lane'' refers to the higher-speed passing lane closest to the centre of the road, while ''inside lane'' refers to the lane closer to the edge of the road; these terms have the opposite meanings in American English, with the ''outside lane'' being the one near the edge and the ''inside lane'' being the one closer to the median &amp;mdash; it is worth noting that Americans also drive on the opposite side to British people, so that the British inside lane is, like the American one, the leftmost one (going in any given direction).

In the UK, Australia, and New Zealand ''drink driving'' is against the law, while in the U.S. and Canada, the term is ''drunk driving''.

===Greetings===
In the US, when Christmas is explicitly mentioned in a greeting, the universal phrasing is ''[[Merry Christmas]]''.  A British alternative, ''Happy Christmas'', is unusual in America; while its meaning is obvious, it might still garner the speaker some odd looks.  However, Americans quite often say &quot;Happy Holidays&quot; in referring to the Christmas season.



==Writing==
===Spelling===
:''Main article: [[American and British English spelling differences]]''

Some words shared by all English speakers are ''spelled'' one way by Americans (and at times Canadians and Australians) but are ''spelt'' differently in some (or, at times, most) other English speaking countries.

* Traditionally, many English verbs have been spelled with both ''-ize'' and ''-ise''. The ''-ise'' is often used over ''-ize'' (e.g. organise, legalise) in British English, but ''-ize'' is always used in American English (''advertise'' being a rare exception). The American usage is the result of several reforms spearheaded by [[Noah Webster]] in the [[19th century]], while the British usage (where ''-ize'' was traditionally dominant) comes from 19th-century French influence. Perhaps because of this, ''-ize'' is preferred by Oxford University Press, is listed first in most British Dictionaries, and is preferred by many careful users of English in the UK; see [http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutspelling/ize?view=uk Oxford's rationale] on the matter for more information. The same is true of nouns and adjectives derived from such verbs: ''organisation'' vs. ''organization'', etc. One notable exception is the verb ''to analyse'', which although spelled ''to analyze'' in American English was never spelled that way in British English. Furthermore, not all such words are spelled with ''-ize'' even in American English: for example, ''incise,'' ''circumcise.'' These are not examples of the suffix -ize, but the element -cise, meaning &quot;to cut.&quot;

===Punctuation===
* '''Full stops/Periods in abbreviations''': Americans tend to write &quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Mrs.&quot;, &quot;St.&quot;, &quot;Dr.&quot; etc., while British will usually, but not always, write &quot;Mr&amp;quot;, &quot;Mrs&quot;, &quot;St&quot;, &quot;Dr&quot; (or even &quot;D'r&quot;), etc., following the rule that a full stop is used only when the last letter of the abbreviation is not the last letter of the complete word. However, many British writers would tend to write other abbreviations without a full stop, such as &quot;Prof&quot;, &quot;etc&quot;, &quot;eg&quot;, and so on (so recommended by some Oxford dictionaries). The rationale behind this usage is that it is typographically more elegant, and that the omitted full stops/periods are essentially superfluous, as the reader recognizes the abbreviation without them. It also removes ambiguity by reserving the period for ending sentences. However, the &quot;American&quot; usage of periods after most abbreviations is also widely used in the UK. Note that in either case it is incorrect to put a period after units such as kg for kilogram or Hz for hertz, as these are considered unit symbols, not abbreviations; however, the unit for &quot;inch&quot; is properly &quot;in.&quot;, as it would be ambiguous without the period.
* It is sometimes believed that British English does not hyphenate multiple-word adjectives, such as &quot;a first class ticket&quot;. This usage is rare, and often considered incorrect. The most common form is as in American English, such as &quot;a first-class ticket&quot;.
* '''[[Quotation mark|Quoting]]''': Americans start with double quotation marks (&quot;) and use single quotation marks (') for quotations within quotations.  In general this is also true of British English but can be the opposite when used in book publishing, for example. In journals and newspapers, quotation mark double/single use depends on the individual publication's [[house style]].
* '''Contents of quotations''': Americans are taught to put commas and periods inside quotation marks, whereas British people will put the punctuation inside if it belongs to the quote and outside otherwise. This means that direct speech retains punctuation inside inverted commas in British English also, with a full stop changing into a comma if followed by explanatory text.
** Carefree means &quot;free from care or anxiety.&quot; (American style)
** Carefree means &quot;free from care or anxiety&quot;. (British style)
** &quot;Hello world,&quot; I said. (both styles)
: The American style was established for typographical reasons, having to do with the aesthetics of commas and quotation marks in typeset text. It also usefully eliminates the need to decide whether a period or comma belongs to the quotation. However, many people find the usage counterintuitive. ''[[Hart's Rules]]'' and the ''[[Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors]]'' call the British style &quot;new&quot; or &quot;logical&quot; quoting; it is similar to the use of quotation marks in many other languages (including Spanish, French, Italian, Catalan, Dutch, and German). This &quot;logical&quot; style is increasingly popular in America, although [[Formal written English - regional differences|formal writing]] generally calls for the &quot;American&quot; style. In fact, the British style is often the ''de facto'' standard among Americans for whom formal or professional writing is not a part of their daily life; many are in fact unaware that the normative American usage is to place commas and periods within the quotation marks. (This rule of placing all punctuation inside quotation if and only if it belongs to the quotation is expressly prescribed by some American professional organisations such as the American Chemical Society; see ''ACS Style Guide''.) According to the [[Jargon File]], American [[Hacker|hackers]]  have switched to using &quot;logical&quot; British quotation system, because including extraneous punctuation in a quotation can sometimes change the fundamental meaning of the quotation. More generally, it is difficult for computer manuals, online instructions, and other textual media to accurately quote exactly what a computer user should see or type on their computer.
:The American rule was used worldwide up to around the Second World War, after which the more logical style of presenting quotation marks took hold everywhere except America.
* '''Letter-writing''': American students in some areas have been taught to write a colon after the greeting in business letters (&quot;Dear Sir:&quot;) while British people usually write a comma (&quot;Dear Sir,&quot;) or make use of the so-called ''open punctuation'' (&quot;Dear Sir&quot;).  However, this practice is not consistent throughout the United States, and it would be regarded as a highly formal usage by most Americans.

===Titles and headlines===
Use of [[capitalisation]] varies.

In American English, a capital letter is typically used after an exclamation point, as in: &quot;Good grief, Jim! Leave the man alone.&quot; In British English the expression could be rendered as 'Good grief, Jim! leave the man alone.' although the American capitalisation is typical.

Sometimes, the words in titles of publications, newspaper headlines, as well as chapter and section headings are capitalised in the same manner as in normal sentences ([[sentence case]]).  That is, only the first word is capitalised, along with [[proper noun]]s, [[acronym]]s, etc.

However, publishers sometimes require additional words in titles and headlines to be capitalised, for added [[emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], as it is often perceived as appearing more professional.  In American English, this is common in titles, but less so in newspaper headlines. The exact rules differ between publishers and are often ambiguous; a typical approach is to capitalise all words other than short [[Article (grammar)|article]]s, [[preposition]]s, and [[conjunction]]s.  This should probably be regarded as a common stylistic difference, rather than a linguistic difference, as neither form would be considered incorrect or unusual in either the UK or the U.S.  Many British newspapers use fully capitalised headlines for impact, as opposed to readability (examples include ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', ''[[The Daily Sport]]'', ''[[News of the World]]'').

===Dates===
Date formats are usually written differently in the short (numerical) form. Christmas Day 2000, for example, is 25/12/00 in the UK and 12/25/00 in the U.S., although occasionally other formats are encountered, such as the [[ISO 8601]] 2000-12-25, popular among programmers and others seeking to avoid ambiguity. The difference in short-form date order can lead to misunderstanding. For example, 06/04/05 could mean either [[4 June]] [[2005]] (U.S.) or [[6 April]] [[2005]] (UK).

A consequence of the different short-form of dates is that in the UK many people would be reluctant to refer to &quot;9/11&quot; although its meaning would be instantly understood.  Apart from normally referring to 9th November, dates are not usually abbreviated in this manner in speech in the UK. Londoners would generally refer to the &quot;the seventh of July bombings&quot; and not 7/7.  On the BBC &quot;September the 11th&quot; is generally used in preference to 9/11.

When writing long-form dates, the format &quot;December&amp;nbsp;25, 2000&quot; is generally encountered in the U.S., and widely encountered in the UK. However, the British are more likely than Americans to use the format &quot;25&amp;nbsp;December 2000&quot; although it is acceptable in the U.S., and the American grammarians [[Strunk and White]], among others, recommend it. American military usage follows the British model: &quot;25&amp;nbsp;December 2005&quot; and &quot;25/12/05.&quot;  It is common in the UK, and somewhat less so in the U.S., to add a superscripted 'st, nd, rd' or 'th' to the day number in informal writing (thus &quot;25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;December 2000&quot; or &quot;December&amp;nbsp;25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000&quot;), but this is generally regarded as superfluous and avoided in formal use.

Similarly, in American speech, &quot;December twenty-fifth&quot; is the most likely form, though &quot;the twenty-fifth of December&quot; is also not uncommon.  In the UK the latter is more likely, and even when the month is presented first the definite article is usually inserted in speech, thus &quot;December ''the'' twenty-fifth&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Atomic Semantics''' is a term which describes the guarantees provided by a [[data register]] shared by several [[central processing unit|processor]]s in a [[parallel machine]] or in a network of computers working together.

Atomic semantics are defined for a variable with a single writer but multiple readers. These
semantics are very strong: they guarantee that the read and write operations to the variable behave exactly as if they happened instantaneously in some point in time which is within the actual time where the operation took place.

==Reference==

Atomic semantics are defined formally in Lamport's &quot;On Interprocess Communication&quot; Distributed Computing 1, 2 (1986), 77-101. (Also appeared as SRC Research Report 8).

      <comment>/* Dynamics of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current */ ncrease -&gt; increase</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Antarctic Circumpolar Current''' (ACC) is an [[ocean current]] that flows from west to east around [[Antarctica]]. An alternate name for the ACC is the West Wind Drift. The ACC is the dominant circulation feature of the [[Southern Ocean]]. The ACC has been known to sailors for many years, the author [[Jack London]]'s story &quot;Make Westing&quot; poignantly illustrated the difficulty it caused for mariners seeking to round [[Cape Horn]] on the clipper ship route between New York and California.

==Structure of the Circumpolar Current==

The ACC connects the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean]] basins and as such serves as a principal pathway of exchange between these basins. The current is strongly constrained by [[topography|topographic]] features. Starting at [[South America]], it flows through the [[Drake Passage]] between South America and the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] and then is split by the [[Scotia Arc]] to the east, with a shallow warm branch flowing to the north in the [[Falklands Current]] and a deeper branch passing through the Arc more to the east before also turning to the north. Passing through the Indian Ocean, the current is split by the [[Kerguelen Plateau]] in the Indian Ocean, with most of the transport passing to the north.  South of [[New Zealand]], it follows the contours of the [[Campbell Plateau]] first deflecting far to the south and then moving northward again. Deflection is also seen as it passes over the [[mid-ocean ridge]] in the Southeast Pacific.

The current consists of a number of fronts. The northern boundary of the ACC is defined by the Subtropical Front. This marks the boundary between warm, salty subtropical waters (generally with a [[salinity]] of greater than 34.9 parts per thousand) and fresher, cooler subpolar waters. Moving southward we find the Subantarctic Front, along which much of the ACC transport is carried. Further south still lies the Polar Front, which is marked by a transition to very cold, relatively fresh, Antarctic Surface Water at the surface. Further south still we find Southern Boundary front, which is determined as the point where very dense abyssal waters upwell to within a few hundred meters of the surface. The bulk of the transport is carried in the middle two fronts. The total transport of the ACC at Drake Passage is estimated to be around 135 [[Sverdrup]], or about 135 times the transport of all the world's rivers combined. There is a relatively small addition of flow in the Indian Ocean, with the transport south of [[Tasmania]] reaching around 147 Sv, at which point the current is probably the largest on the planet.

==Dynamics of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current ==

There is general agreement that the large transport of the Circumpolar Current is linked to the strong westerly winds which are found in the Southern Ocean and to the fact that these winds blow over a band of open latitudes. In latitudes where there are continents, winds blowing on light surface water can simply pile up light water against these continents. But in the Southern Ocean, the momentum imparted to the surface waters cannot be balanced in this way.

Different theories of the Circumpolar Current balance the momentum imparted by the winds in different ways. The increasing eastward momentum imparted by the winds causes water parcels to drift outwards from the axis of the earth's rotation (in other words, northward) as a result of the [[Coriolis force]]. This northward transport is balanced by a southward, pressure-driven flow below the depths of the major ridge systems. Some theories connect these flows, implying that there is significant upwelling of dense deep waters within the Southern Ocean, transformation of these waters into light surface waters, and a transformation of waters in the opposite direction to the north. This theory links the magnitude of the Circumpolar Current with the global [[thermohaline circulation]], particularly the properties of the [[North Atlantic]]. A contrary view, however, suggests that eddies, the oceanic equivalent of atmospheric storms, transport momentum downwards in the water column, so that while the deep waters are set into motion, this motion simply involves southward flow in troughs and northward flow over ridges with no transformation into light surface waters required.

Recently much attention has been paid to the fact that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current may vary with time.  One aspect of this variability is the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Wave]], a periodic oscillation that affects the climate of much of the southern hemisphere. Another is the [[Antarctic Oscillation]], which involves changes in the location and strength of Antarctic winds. Trends in the Antarctic Oscillation have been hypothesized to account for an increase in the transport of the Circumpolar Current over the past two decades.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arbor Day''' is an [[United States|American]] [[holiday]] that encourages the planting and care of [[tree]]s. In China, it also commemorates the passing of Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]].

==Observance==
Arbor Day occurs in the [[United States]] every year on the last Friday in April. The customary observance is to plant a tree, but it is not a public holiday and is no longer widely observed in [[United States|America]] (except in [[Nebraska]], where it is a public holiday); in other states, it has been displaced by the emphasis on [[Earth Day]].

Similar holidays exist worldwide, some going by the same name, as in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]], and spelt '''Arbour Day'''.

==Quotes==
:''Other holidays repose upon the past; Arbor Day proposes for the future.'' 
:::&amp;mdash; J. Sterling Morton.

:''Each generation takes the Earth as trustees. We ought to bequeath to posterity as many forests and orchards as we have exhausted and consumed.''
:::&amp;mdash; J. Sterling Morton, 1887.

==History==
Arbor Day was established by [[J. Sterling Morton]] of [[Nebraska City, Nebraska]] in [[1872]].

J. Sterling Morton and his wife moved from [[Detroit, Michigan]] to the [[Nebraska Territory]] in [[1854]], where he was the editor of Nebraska's first newspaper. His influence as a journalist led to his involvement in politics, and he became a promoter of the settlement of Nebraska. The lack of trees, however, was an obstacle.

The [[Great Plains]] had been described as the ''&quot;[[Great American Desert]].&quot;'' The [[tallgrass prairie]] that covered much of Nebraska at that time could provide rich farmland, but without wood for building houses or for fuel to heat homes, few found it convenient to settle there. Even the allotment of free land by the [[Homestead Act]] failed to entice sufficient numbers of families to relocate to [[Nebraska]].

[[J. Sterling Morton|Morton]] proposed Arbor Day as a tree planting holiday in 1872 at a meeting of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. On the first Arbor Day, prizes were offered to counties and to individuals for properly planting the largest number of trees. It was claimed that more than 1 million trees were planted in Nebraska on that day.

During the course of the 1870s, several other states passed legislation to observe Arbor Day. Schools began to adopt the tradition beginning in 1882. By 1894, Arbor Day was celebrated in each state of the [[United States]].

==Memorial parks==
Morton's home in Nebraska City, [[Arbor Lodge]], is a state historical park, which includes an [[arboretum]] and extensive landscaped grounds. Adjacent to the public park, Morton's farm, now called '''Arbor Day Farm''', is run for the benefit of the '''National Arbor Day Foundation'''. 

==Arbor Day in China==
Arbor Day (植樹節) is a [[Holidays in the Republic of China|public holiday]] in the [[Republic of China]] on [[March 12]]. It commemorates the passing of Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]], the [[Father of the Nation]], in [[1925]].

'''Sir Alfred Jules Ayer''' ([[October 29]], [[1910]] &amp;ndash; [[June 27]], [[1989]]), better known as '''A. J. Ayer''' (or Freddie by his friends), was a British philosopher known for his promotion of [[logical positivism]], particularly in his books ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'' (1936) and  ''The Problem of Knowledge'' (1956).

Ayer was the Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at the [[University College London]] from 1946 until 1959, when he became [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was knighted in 1970. 

==Life==
Ayer received an education in the humanities at [[Eton College]], and served in the British military during [[World War II]], working in military intelligence for a time.  He was a noted social mixer and womanizer, and was married four times, including to Dee Wells and Vanessa Lawson (nee Salmon).   Reputedly he liked dancing and attending the clubs in [[London]].

He was a friend of [[Isaiah Berlin]].

Ayer was an avowed atheist, and followed in the footsteps of [[Bertrand Russell]] by debating with the Jesuit scholar [[Frederick Copleston]] on the topic of religion.

Ayer was closely associated with the British [[secular humanism|humanist]] movement. He was an Honorary Associate of the [[Rationalist Press Association]] from 1947 until his death.  In 1965, he became the first president of the Agnostics' Adoption Society and in the same year succeeded [[Julian Huxley]] as president of the [[British Humanist Association]], a post he held until 1970. In 1968 he edited &quot;The Humanist Outlook&quot;, a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism. 

He taught or lectured several times in the [[United States]], including serving as a visiting professor at [[Bard College]] in the fall of 1987. At a party that same year held by fashion designer [[Fernando Sanchez]], Ayer, then 77, confronted [[Mike Tyson]] harassing [[Naomi Campbell]]. When Ayer demanded that Tyson stop, the boxer said: &quot;Do you know who the fuck I am? I'm the heavyweight champion of the world,&quot; to which Ayer replied: &quot;And I am the former Wykeham Professor of Logic. We are both pre-eminent in our field. I suggest that we talk about this like rational men&quot; (Rogers 1999:344).

Shortly before his death in 1989 he received publicity after having an unusual [[near-death experience]], which some erroneously interpreted as a move away from his lifelong and famous [[religious skepticism]].

==Works==
In some ways, Ayer was the philosophical successor to [[Bertrand Russell]], and he wrote two books on the philosopher: ''Russell and Moore: The Analytic Heritage'' (1971) and ''Russell'' (1972).  He also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of [[David Hume]].

Ayer is perhaps best known for his [[verification principle]], as presented in &quot;[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]&quot; (1936), according to which a sentence is meaningful only if it has verifiable empirical import.  He started work on the book at the age of 24 and it was published when he was 26.   Ayer's philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the [[Vienna Circle]].  His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes [[Language, Truth and Logic]] essential reading on the tenets of [[logical positivism]] -- the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century philosophy, and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world.  

In 1972-73 Ayer gave the [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[St. Andrews University]], later published as ''The Central Questions of Philosophy''.  He still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists: that large parts of what was traditionally called &quot;philosophy&quot; - including the whole of [[metaphysics]], [[theology]] and [[aesthetics]] - were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.  Unsurprisingly, this made him unpopular with several other philosophy departments in this country and his name is still reviled by many British professors to this day.

In &quot;The Concept of a Person and Other Essays&quot; (1963), Ayer made several striking criticisms of [[Wittgenstein]]'s private language theory.

Ayer's sense-data theory in ''Foundations of Empirical Knowledge'' was famously criticised by fellow Oxonian [[J. L. Austin]] in ''[[Sense and sensibilia]]'', a landmark 1950's work of common language philosophy.  Ayer responded to this in the essay &quot;Has Austin refuted the sense-date theory?&quot;, which can be found in his ''Metaphysics and Common Sense'' (1969).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''André Weil''' ([[May 6]], [[1906]] - [[August 6]], [[1998]]) was one of the great [[mathematician]]s of the [[20th century]], whether measured by his research work, its influence on future work, exposition or breadth. He is known for his foundational work in [[number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. He was a founding member, and ''de facto'' the early leader, of the influential [[Bourbaki group]]. The [[philosopher]] [[Simone Weil]] was his sister.

==Life==

Born in [[Paris]] to Alsatian parents who fled the annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] to [[Germany]], he studied in Paris, [[Rome]] and [[Göttingen]] and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in [[1928]]. He spent two academic years at [[Aligarh Muslim University]] from 1930. [[Sanskrit literature]] was a life-long interest of his. He had a one-year position in [[Marseilles]], and then spent six years in [[Strasbourg]]. He married Eveline in 1937.

A [[conscientious objector]] by conviction, and a [[Jew]], Weil was in [[Finland]] when [[World War II]] broke out; he had been travelling in Scandinavia since April 1939. Eveline returned to France, but he did not. A famous anecdote  was confirmed in his [[autobiography]]: after having been arrested under suspicion of [[espionage]] in Finland, when the USSR attacked on [[30 November]] [[1939]], he was saved from being shot only by the intervention of [[Rolf Nevanlinna]]. He returned to France via Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was detained at [[Le Havre]] in January 1940. He was charged with failure to report for duty, and was imprisoned in Le Havre and then [[Rouen]]. It was there in the military prison in Bonne-Nouvelle, a district of Rouen, from February to May, that he did the work that made his reputation. He was sent to trial on [[May 3]] [[1940]]. Sentenced to five years, he asked to be sent to a military unit instead, and joined a regiment in [[Cherbourg]]. After the [[fall of France]], he met up with his family in Marseilles, where he arrived by sea. He then went to [[Clermont-Ferrand]], where he managed to join Eveline, who had been in the German-occupied region. In January 1941 they left by sea from Marseilles, and sailed to New York.

During the war, Weil went to the United States where he was supported by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and [[Guggenheim Foundation]]. He was at the [[Universidade de São Paulo]] for two years from 1945, where he spent much time with [[Oscar Zariski]]. He taught at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1947 to 1958 before settling at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton Township, New Jersey|Princeton]].

==Work==

He made substantial contributions in many areas, the most important being profound connections between [[algebraic geometry]] and [[number theory]]. This began in his doctoral work leading to the [[Mordell-Weil theorem]] (1928, and shortly applied in [[Siegel's theorem on integral points]]). [[Mordell's theorem]] had an ''ad hoc'' proof; Weil began the separation of the [[infinite descent]] argument into two types of structural approach, by means of [[height function]]s for sizing rational points, and by means of [[Galois cohomology]], not to be named as that for two more decades. Both aspects have steadily developed into substantial theories. 

Among his major accomplishments were the 1940 proof, while in prison, of the [[Riemann hypothesis]] for [[local zeta-function]]s, and his subsequent laying of proper foundations for algebraic geometry to support that result (from 1942 to 1946, most intensively). By modern standards his claim to have a proof had a very easy ride, but wartime conditions were one factor, and the fact that the German experts made little or no comment another. The so-called [[Weil conjecture]]s were hugely influential from around 1950; they were later proved by [[Bernard Dwork]], [[Alexander Grothendieck]], [[Michael Artin]], and [[Pierre Deligne]], who completed the most difficult step in 1973. 

He had introduced the [[adele ring]] in the late 1930s, following [[Claude Chevalley]]'s lead with the [[idele]]s, and given a proof of the [[Riemann-Roch theorem]] with them (a version appeared in his ''Basic Number Theory'' in 1967). His 'matrix divisor' ([[vector bundle]] ''avant le jour'') Riemann-Roch theorem from 1938 was a very early anticipation of later ideas such as moduli spaces of bundles. The [[Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers]] proved resistant for many years. Eventually the adelic approach became basic in [[automorphic representation]] theory. He picked up another credited ''Weil conjecture'', around 1970, which later under pressure from [[Serge Lang]] became known as the [[Shimura-Taniyama conjecture]] based on the presentation of the basic ideas at the 1955 Nikko conference. His attitude towards conjectures struck many in the field as oblique; he wrote that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Shimura-Taniyama case the evidence was only there after extensive computational work.

Other significant results were on [[Pontryagin duality]] and [[differential geometry]]. He introduced the concept of [[uniform space]] in [[general topology]]. His work on [[sheaf theory]] hardly appears in his published papers, but correspondence with [[Henri Cartan]] in the late 1940s proved most influential.

His discovery that the so-called [[Weil representation]], previously introduced in [[quantum mechanics]] by [[Irving Segal]] and Shale, gave a proper framework for understanding the classical theory of [[quadratic form]]s, and was also a beginning of a substantial development connecting [[representation theory]] and [[theta-function]]s.  

His books, unusually for mathematics, had an important influence on research. (In one major case possibly negative: [[Alexander Grothendieck]] is supposed to have complained of the 'aridity' of Weil's ''Foundations of Algebraic Geometry''. This is a good joke, if unintentional.) Through Bourbaki's writings and seminars, Weil's ideas can also be traced in the mainstream of post-war mathematics.

More trivially, he invented the notation &quot;Ø&quot; for the [[empty set]] (''q.v.'').

:&lt;small&gt;André Weil is not be confused with [[Hermann Weyl]], who helped Weil receive a [[Guggenheim fellowship]] in 1944; or with [[Andrew Wiles]], another famous mathematician who, like Weil, has done important work in [[elliptic curve]]s. Pronunciation: &quot;Weil&quot; is ''vay'', while &quot;[[Weyl]]&quot; is ''vile'', and &quot;Wiles&quot; is just ''wiles''. &lt;/small&gt;

The '''Achaeans''' (also '''Akhaians''', [[Greek language|Greek]] Αχαιοί) is the collective name given to the  Greek forces in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] (used 598 times). An alternative name, used interchangeably, is '''Danaans''' (Δαναοί, used 138 times) and  '''Argives''' (Αργίτες, used 29 times). ''Argives'' is a political annotation drawn from the original capital of the Achaeans, [[Argos]]. ''Danaans'' is the name attributed to the tribe first dominating the [[Peloponnese]] and the area near Argos. ''Achaeans'' is the name of the tribe that, reinforced by the [[Aeolians]], first dominated Greek territories, centering itself around its capital in [[Mycenae]].

More specifically, '''Achaea''' in Homer is the province of [[Agamemnon]], chief commander of the Greek forces, the northern part of the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula, roughly corresponding to the modern [[Prefectures of Greece|prefectures]] of [[Achaea]] and [[Corinth]]. The Homeric Achaeans would have been a part of the [[Mycenaean civilization]] that dominated Greece from ca. [[1600 BC]], with a history as a tribe that may have gone back to the prehistoric [[Hellenic]] immigration in the late [[3rd millennium BC]].

Some [[Hittite language|Hittite]] texts mention a nation in western [[Anatolia]] called '''''Ahhiyawa'''''; in particular the [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Mursili II]] in ca. [[1320 BC]] wrote a letter to the king of the ''Ahhiyawa'', treating him as an equal and suggesting that [[Miletus]] (''Millawanda'') was under his control, and also referring to an earlier &quot;''Wilusa'' episode&quot; involving hostility on the part of the ''Ahhiyawa''. This people has been identified with the Achaeans of the [[Trojan War]] and the city of Wilusa with the legendary city of [[Troy]] (note the similarity with ''Ilion'', the name of the [[acropolis]] of Troy). However the exact relationship of the term ''Ahhiyawa'' to the Achaeans beyond a similarity in pronunciation is hotly debated by scholars.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Atle Selberg''' (born [[June 17]], [[1917]]) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] known for his work in [[analytic number theory]], and in the theory of [[automorphic form]]s, in particular bringing them into relation with [[spectral theory]].  

Selberg was born in [[Langesund]], [[Norway]]. While he was still at school he was influenced by the work of [[Srinivasa Aaiyangar Ramanujan]]. He studied at the [[University of Oslo]] and completed his dr. philos. ([[Ph.D.]]) grade in [[1943]].

During the [[second world war]] he worked in isolation due to the German military occupation of [[Norway]].  After the war his accomplishments became known, including a proof that positive proportion of the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] lie on the line 1/2.  After the war he turned to [[sieve theory]], a previously neglected topic which Selberg's work brought into prominence.  In a [[1947]] paper he introduced the [[Selberg sieve]], a method which led to [[Chen's theorem]] among other important results. Then in [[1948]] Selberg, working with [[Paul Erdős]], gave an elementary [[mathematical proof|proof]] of the [[prime number theorem]] (although there was a dispute between them about to whom this result should primarily be attributed).  For all these accomplishments Selberg received the [[1950]] [[Fields Medal]].

Selberg moved to the [[United States]] and settled at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in the [[1950s]] where he remains today.  During the 1950s he worked on introducing [[spectral theory]] into [[number theory]], culminating into his development of the [[Selberg trace formula]], his most famous result.  This establishes a duality between the length spectrum of a [[Riemann surface]] and the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[Laplacian]] which is analogous to the duality between the [[prime number]]s and the zeros of the zeta function. He was awarded the [[1986]] [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]].

{{dablink|This article is about the ancient Greek playwright. For other uses, see [[Aeschylus (disambiguation)]]}}

'''Aeschylus''' ([[525 BC]]&amp;mdash;[[456 BC]]; [[Greek language|Greek]]: '''Α{{polytonic|&amp;#x1f30;}}σχύλος''') was a [[playwright]] of [[ancient Greece]].
Aeschylus was the earliest of the three greatest [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedians]], the others being [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]].  

==Biography==
Born in [[Eleusis]], a district of [[Athens]], he wrote his first plays in [[498 BC]], but his earliest surviving [[play]] is probably ''[[The Persians]]'', performed in [[472 BC]]. In [[490 BC]], he participated in the [[Battle of Marathon]], and in [[480 BC]] he fought at the [[Battle of Salamis]]. Salamis was the subject of ''[[The Persians]]'', written eight years later; it is now generally accepted that ''[[The Suppliants (Aeschylus)|The Suppliants]]'', once thought to be Aeschylus's earliest surviving tragedy, and so the earliest complete Attic tragedy to survive, was written in the last decade of his life, making ''The Persians'' his earliest.

Aeschylus frequently travelled to [[Sicily]], where the [[tyrant]] of [[Gela]] was a patron. In [[458 BC]] he travelled there for the last time; according to traditional legend, Aeschylus was killed in [[456 BC]] when an [[eagle]] (or more likely a [[Lammergeier]]), mistaking the playwright's bald crown for a stone, dropped a [[tortoise]] on his head (though some accounts differ, claiming it was a stone dropped by an [[eagle]] or [[vulture]] that likely mistook his bald head for the egg of a [[flightless bird]]).

The inscription on his gravestone was written by himself before his death, and makes no mention of his [[theater|theatrical]] renown. He chose to commemorate his military achievements only. It read: -“ This tomb the dust of Aeschylus doth hide, Euphorion's son and fruitful Gela's pride; How tried his valor Marathon may tell, And long-haired Medes, who knew it all too well.”


&quot;In Greek:
&quot;&amp;#913;&amp;#953;&amp;#963;&amp;#967;&amp;#973;&amp;#955;&amp;#959;&amp;#957; &amp;#917;&amp;#965;&amp;#966;&amp;#959;&amp;#961;&amp;#943;&amp;#969;&amp;#957;&amp;#959;&amp;#962; &amp;#913;&amp;#952;&amp;#951;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#943;&amp;#959;&amp;#957; &amp;#964;&amp;#972;&amp;#948;&amp;#949; &amp;#954;&amp;#949;&amp;#973;&amp;#952;&amp;#949;&amp;#953; &amp;#956;&amp;#957;&amp;#942;&amp;#956;&amp;#945;, &amp;#960;&amp;#949;&amp;#960;&amp;#957;&amp;#965;&amp;#956;&amp;#941;&amp;#957;&amp;#959;&amp;#957; &amp;#960;&amp;#965;&amp;#961;&amp;#959;&amp;#966;&amp;#972;&amp;#961;&amp;#959;&amp;#953;&amp;#959; &amp;#915;&amp;#941;&amp;#955;&amp;#945;&amp;#962;. 
&amp;#913;&amp;#955;&amp;#954;&amp;#942;&amp;#957; &amp;#948;' &amp;#949;&amp;#965;&amp;#948;&amp;#972;&amp;#954;&amp;#953;&amp;#956;&amp;#959;&amp;#957; &amp;#956;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#945;&amp;#952;&amp;#974;&amp;#957;&amp;#949;&amp;#953;&amp;#959;&amp;#957; &amp;#940;&amp;#955;&amp;#963;&amp;#959;&amp;#962; &amp;#945;&amp;#957; &amp;#949;&amp;#943;&amp;#960;&amp;#959;&amp;#953; &amp;#954;&amp;#945;&amp;#953; &amp;#946;&amp;#945;&amp;#952;&amp;#965;&amp;#967;&amp;#945;&amp;#953;&amp;#964;&amp;#942;&amp;#949;&amp;#953;&amp;#962; &amp;#924;&amp;#942;&amp;#948;&amp;#959;&amp;#962; &amp;#949;&amp;#960;&amp;#953;&amp;#963;&amp;#964;&amp;#940;&amp;#956;&amp;#949;&amp;#957;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;&quot;

==Works==
Aeschylus' work has a strong moral and religious emphasis, concentrating on man's position in the cosmos in relation to the gods, divine law and divine punishment in the [[Oresteia]] trilogy. Besides the literary merit of his work, Aeschylus' greatest contribution to the theater was the addition of a second actor to his scenes.  Previously, the action took place between a single actor and the [[Greek chorus]]. This invention was only attributed to him by later tradition, however.

Aeschylus is known to have written about 90 plays, only 7 of which remain extant:
*''[[The Persians]]'' ([[472 BC]]) (''Persai'')
*''[[Seven Against Thebes]]'' ([[467 BC]]) (''Hepta epi Thebas'')
*''[[The Suppliants (Aeschylus)|The Suppliants]]'' ([[463 BC]]?) (''Hiketides'')
*''[[Oresteia]]'' ([[458 BC]])
**''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]''
**''[[The Libation Bearers]]'' (''Choephori'')
**''[[The Eumenides]]'' 

In addition, the canon of Aeschylus' plays includes a seventh, ''[[Prometheus Bound]]''. Attributed to Aeschylus in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], it is generally considered by modern scholars to be the work of an unknown [[4th century BC]] playwright, quite possibly Ion, Aeschylus' son. Its language is much simpler than that which Aeschylus usually utilises, without nearly as much complex metaphor and imagery, and is closer to Sophocles' style (though it is not at all suggested that Sophocles is its author); its hostility to the figure of [[Zeus]] is completely at odds with the religious views of the other six plays.  

In the early [[1990]]s fragments of another Aeschylean play, which had been mentioned in ancient sources, were discovered in the wrappings of a [[mummy]] in [[Egypt]]. The play, ''[[Achilles (play)|Achilles]]'', was part of a trilogy about the [[Trojan War]]. It had been lost for over 2,000 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Amber Road''' (in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: ''Gintaro kelias''; [[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Szlak Bursztynowy'', ''Jantarowy Szlak''; in [[German language|German]]: ''Bernsteinstraße''; in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Borostyán út'', in [[Russian (language)|Russian]]: ''Янтарный путь'') was an ancient [[trade route]] for the transfer of [[amber]]. As one of the waterways and ancient highways, for centuries the road led from [[Europe]] to [[Asia]] and back, and from northern Europe to the [[Mediterranean]]. 

A vital component of ornamental objects, [[amber]] was transported from the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]] coasts overland by way of the [[Vistula]] and [[Dnieper river|Dnieper]] rivers to [[Italy]], [[Greece]], the [[Black Sea]], and [[Egypt]] long before the birth of [[Jesus]], and long after. 

In [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, a main route ran south from the Baltic coast in [[Prussia]] through the land of the [[Boii]] (modern [[Bohemia]]) to the head of the [[Adriatic Sea]].  The Egyptian pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]] had Baltic amber among his burial goods, and amber was sent from the North Sea to the temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]] as an offering. From the [[Black Sea]], trade could continue to Asia along the [[Silk Road]], another ancient trade route.

The [[Prussian people|Prussian]] town of [[Truso]] on the Baltic, was one of the main trading places;  Truso was near the town of [[Elblag|Elbląg]], near lake [[Druzno]], in the [[Masurian]] lake district.

In [[Scandinavia]] the amber road probably gave rise to the thriving [[Nordic Bronze Age]] culture, bringing influences from the Mediterranean Sea to the northernmost countries of Europe.

==Overview of known amber roads by country==

===Poland===

The shortest (and possibly oldest) road avoids [[alpine]] areas and led from the Baltic coastline (Estland) heading southwards to [[Bratislava]] down to Aquileia at the [[Adriatic]] coast. Another route led towards the [[Black Sea]] in Russia.

===Germany===
[[Image:German Amber Roads.gif|thumb|right|250px|Amber Roads in Germany.]] 
Several roads connected the [[North Sea]] (Nordsee) and [[Baltic Sea|East Sea]] (Ostsee), especially the city of Ambur (now [[Hamburg]]) to the [[Brenner Pass]] (&quot;Burner&quot;-pass), proceeding southwards to [[Brindisi]] ''([[Brundisium]])'' in Italy and Ambracia (Greece). ''(See map at right)''

===Switzerland===
The Swiss region indicates a number of alpine roads, concentrating around the capital city [[Bern]] (''Bernstein'' is the German for amber) and probably originating from the borders of the [[Rhône River]] and the [[Rhine]].

===Holland===
A small section, including Baarn, Barneveld, Am(b)ersfoort and Am(b)erongen, and connected the North Sea with the Lower Rhine.

===Belgium===
A small section, led southwards from [[Antwerp]] and [[Bruges]] to the towns Braine-l’Alleud and Braine-le-Comte, both originally named &quot;Brennia-Brenna&quot; (Latin: “Burner”). The route have continued by following the [[Meuse River]].

===France===
Only a fragment at [[Ambares]] (near Bordeaux).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Atlantic Baptist University''' is a small [[Liberal Arts]] university located in [[Moncton, New Brunswick]], [[Canada]]. It offers undergraduate degrees in Arts, Science, and Education, and is run by the [[Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches]].

The school was founded in [[1949]] under the name [[United Baptist Bible Training School]] (UBBTS), and served as both a [[secondary school]] and a [[Bible school]]. Over two decades, the focus of the school gradually shifted toward post-secondary programs. In [[1968]], UBBTS became a Bible and Junior Christian Liberal Arts College, and in [[1970]] the name was changed to '''Atlantic Baptist College''' (ABC). A sustained campaign to expand the school's faculty and improve the level of education resulted in ABC being able to grant full [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees in the early [[1980s]].  Its campus at this time was located along the Salisbury Road, west of Moncton's central business district.

The institution moved to a new campus constructed on the Gorge Road, north of the central business district, in [[1996]].  The name was also changed to Atlantic Baptist University, a reflection of expanded student enrollment and academic accreditation.  ABU sports teams play under the name ''Blue Tide''.  ABU remains the only English university in [[New Brunswick]]'s second largest, and fastest growing city.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''Andrew Wiles should not be confused with [[André Weil]], another famous mathematician who, like Wiles, has done important work in [[elliptic curve]]s.''
'''Sir Andrew John Wiles''' (born [[April 11]], [[1953]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] living in the [[United States]]. He was educated at [[The Leys School]] Cambridge and  in 1974 he graduated from the [[University of Oxford]].  He then completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at [[ Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1979 and is currently a Professor and the chair of the department of mathematics at [[Princeton University]]. In one of the great success stories in the history of [[mathematics]], Wiles (with help from [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]]) proved [[Fermat's last theorem|Fermat's Last Theorem]] in 1994.

==Early life and work==

Before this result, Andrew Wiles had done outstanding work in [[number theory]]. In work with [[John Coates]] he obtained some of the first results on the famous [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]], and he also did important work on the ''[[Iwasawa main conjecture|main conjecture]]'' of [[Iwasawa theory]].

==Interest in the Fermat problem==

Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT) asserts that there are no positive [[integer]]s ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' such that 

:&lt;math&gt;x^n + y^n = z^n \,&lt;/math&gt;

in which ''n'' is a [[natural number]] greater than 2.  

Wiles had been inspired by the problem as a child when he encountered it in [[Eric Temple Bell|E.T. Bell]]'s book, ''The Last Problem''. His odyssey towards the final [[mathematical proof|proof]] began in 1985 when [[Ken Ribet]], inspired by ideas of [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Gerhard Frey]], proved that Fermat's Last Theorem would follow from another conjecture of [[Yutaka Taniyama|Taniyama]], [[Goro Shimura|Shimura]] and [[André Weil|Weil]], to the effect that every [[elliptic curve]] can be parametrized by [[modular form]]s. Though less familiar than Fermat's Last Theorem, the [[Taniyama-Shimura theorem]] is the more significant of the two, because it touches on truly deep currents in number theory. No one had any idea how to prove it. Working in absolute secrecy, and sharing his ideas and progress only with [[Nicholas Katz]], another professor of mathematics at Princeton, Wiles eventually developed a proof of the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture, and hence of FLT. The proof is a ''tour de force'' introducing many new ideas.

==Announcement and aftermath==

Wiles was uncharacteristically dramatic in revealing the proof. He arranged to give three [[lecture]]s at the [[Isaac Newton Institute]], [[Cambridge]], [[England]], in June of 1993. He did not announce the topic of the lectures in advance, and as the audience and the world became aware of where the lectures were headed, the audience swelled so that the third lecture was to an overpacked room. At the end of the third lecture, he announced &quot;(...) this proves Fermat's Last Theorem. I'll stop here&quot;, and received a standing ovation.

In the following months, the manuscript of the proof was circulated only to a small number of mathematicians while the world waited for its general publication. The first version of the proof depended on the construction of an object called an [[Euler system]], and this aspect proved problematical, as a flaw emerged during [[peer review]] of the subtle and complex mathematics involved. For almost a year it began to seem that Wiles' proof was destined like so many others to be fatally flawed, and that although he had made many important discoveries, the ultimate goal had eluded him.  Wiles was on the point of giving up finally, when he decided to have one last try at  solving the last remaining problem in his proof in collaboration with [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]], one of his former PhD students in 1994.  He commented:
:&quot;... suddenly, totally unexpectedly, I had this incredible revelation. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much ... it was so indescribably beautiful, it was so simple and so elegant, and I just stared in disbelief for twenty minutes, then during the day I walked round the department. I'd keep coming back to my desk to see it was still there &amp;ndash; it was still there.&quot;

The final version of Wiles' proof, which therefore differs from his original one, was published in the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' 141 (1995), pp. 443&amp;ndash;551, together with another, supporting article by Wiles and Taylor titled &quot;[[Ring (mathematics)|Ring]]-theoretic properties of certain [[Hecke algebra]]s&quot; (''Annals of Mathematics'' 141 (1995), pp. 553&amp;ndash;572) relating to the final step of discovery.

==Awards==

Wiles has been awarded several major prizes in mathematics: [[Schock Prize]] ([[1995]]), [[Royal Medal]] (1996), [[Cole Prize]] (1996), [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics|Wolf Prize]] ([[1996]]), a silver plate from the [[International Mathematical Union]] ([[1998]]), [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]] Prize ([[1998]]), [[Clay Research Award]] ([[1999]]) and [[Shaw Prize]] ([[2005]]). He became a [[Knight of the British Empire]] in 2000. Wiles cannot receive the [[Fields Medal]] as the award can only be given to those below 40 years of age (Wiles was born in 1953 and proved the theorem in 1994), a rule strictly adhered to.

'''Anne Brontë''' {{IPA|/b&amp;#633;&amp;#593;nti/}} ([[January 17]], [[1820]] &amp;ndash; [[May 28]], [[1849]]) was a British novelist and poet, the youngest of the [[Brontë]] literary family. 

She was born in the village of [[Thornton, Bradford|Thornton]], [[Yorkshire]], [[England]], the last of six siblings. Anne's mother, Maria Branwell Brontë, died of cancer a year later in [[1821]], after the family had moved to [[Haworth]] where her father, [[Patrick Brontë]], was appointed [[vicar|perpetual curate]]. While she was a child her two eldest siblings, Maria and Elizabeth died of tuberculousis and much has been written about the influence of these deaths on her and her siblings and how it may have affected their later writings. Two of her sisters, [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte]] and [[Emily Brontë|Emily]], were also authors and poets. Anne's poetry was published, along with that of her sisters, in [[1846]], under the [[pseudonym]] &quot;[[Acton Bell]]&quot;.  

Shortly after the deaths of her brother [[Branwell Brontë|Branwell]] and sister Emily in the winter of [[1848]], Anne Brontë died at the [[seaside resort]] of [[Scarborough, England]], where she had gone to convalesce after a prolonged illness. She was buried there at Saint Mary's Churchyard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:Augustine_of_Hippo.jpg|right|thumb|St. Augustine of Hippo as pictured during the [[Renaissance]]]]
'''Aurelius Augustinus''', '''Augustine of Hippo''' (&quot;The knowledgeable one&quot;) ([[November 13]], [[354]]&amp;ndash;[[August 28]], [[430]]) is a [[saint]] and pre-eminent [[Doctor of the Church]] in [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], and is considered by [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to be, together with the [[Apostle Paul]] and the [[Bible]], one of the theological fountainheads of the [[Reformation]] teaching on [[salvation]] and [[divine grace|grace]]. He was the eldest son of [[Monica of Hippo|Saint Monica]]. Works of Saint Augustine, an [[African]] by birth, (as well as a Bishop in the [[Early African Church]]) a [[Rome|Roman]] by education, a [[Milan]]ese by [[baptism]], still inspire many Christians all over the world. His work ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' is often attributed as the first Western [[autobiography]].

==Life==
[[Image:Sainte Monique.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;St Augustine and Monica&quot; (1846), by [[Ary Scheffer]].]]
Saint Augustine was born in [[354]] in [[Tagaste]], a provincial Roman city in [[North Africa]]. He was raised and educated in [[Carthage]]. His mother Monica ([[Saint Monica]]) was a devout [[Catholic]]{{fn|1}} and his father [[Patricius]] a [[Paganism|pagan]] but Augustine followed the controversial [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] religion, much to the horror of his mother. As a youth Augustine lived a hedonistic lifestyle for a time, and in Carthage, he developed a relationship with a young woman who would be his [[concubine]] for over a decade, with whom he had a son. His education and early career was in [[philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]], the art of persuasion and public speaking. He taught in Tagaste and Carthage, but desired to travel to Rome where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practiced (he was later to find out that they would simply refuse to pay). However, Augustine grew disappointed with the Roman schools, which he found apathetic. Manichean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, [[Symmachus]], who had been asked to provide a professor of rhetoric for the imperial court at [[Milan]]. 

The young provincial won the job and headed north to take up his position in late [[384]]. At age thirty, Augustine had won the most visible academic chair in the Latin world, at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers. However, he felt the tensions of life at an imperial court, lamenting one day as he rode in his carriage to deliver a grand speech before the emperor, that a drunken beggar he passed on the street had a less careworn existence than he. 

His mother Monica pressured him to become a Catholic, but it was the bishop of Milan, [[Ambrose]], who had most influence over Augustine. Ambrose was a master of rhetoric like Augustine himself, but older and more experienced. Prompted in part by Ambrose's [[sermon]]s, and other studies, including a disappointing meeting with a key exponent of Manichaean theology, Augustine moved away from Manichaeism; but instead of becoming Catholic like Ambrose and Monica, he converted to a pagan [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] approach to truth, saying that for a time he had a sense of making real progress in his quest, although he eventually lapsed into skepticism.  

Augustine's mother had followed him to Milan and he allowed her to arrange a society marriage, for which he abandoned his concubine (however he had to wait two years until his fiancée came of age; he promptly took up in the meantime with another woman).  It was during this period Augustine of Hippo uttered his famous prayer, &quot;Grant me chastity and continence, but not yet&quot; [da mihi castitatem et continentiam, sed noli modo]. 

In the summer of [[386]], after having read an account of the life of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony of the Desert]] which greatly inspired him, Augustine underwent a profound personal crisis and decided to convert to Christianity, abandon his career in rhetoric, quit his teaching position in Milan, give up any ideas of marriage (much to the horror of his mother), and devote himself entirely to serving [[God]] and the practices of [[priesthood]], which included [[celibacy]]. Key to this conversion/'born again' experience was the voice of a small girl he heard at one point telling him in a sing-song voice to 'Take and read' the Bible, at which point he opened the Bible at random and fell upon a passage from [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]. He would detail his spiritual journey in his famous ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', which went on to become a classic of both Christian theology and world literature. Ambrose baptized Augustine on [[Easter]] day in [[387]], and soon thereafter in [[388]] he returned to Africa. On his way back to Africa his mother died, as did his son soon after, leaving him relatively alone in the world without family.

Upon his return to north Africa he created a [[monastic]] foundation at Tagaste for himself and a group of friends. In [[391]] he was [[ordination|ordained]] a [[priest]] in [[Hippo Regius]], (now [[Annaba]], in [[Algeria]]). He became a famous [[preacher]] (more than 350 preserved sermons are believed to be authentic), and was noted for combating the Manichaean heresy.  

In [[396]] he was made [[coadjutor bishop]] of Hippo (assistant with the right of succession on the death of the current bishop), and remained as [[bishop]] in Hippo until his death in [[430]]. He left his monastery, but continued to lead a monastic life in the episcopal residence. He left a Rule ([[Latin]], ''Regula'') for his monastery that has led him to be designated the &quot;[[patron saint]] of [[Regular Clergy]],&quot; that is, [[parish clergy]] who live by a [[monastic rule]].

Augustine died on [[August 28]], [[430]], during the siege of Hippo by the [[Vandals]]. He is said to have encouraged its citizens to resist the attacks, primarily on the grounds that the Vandals adhered to [[Arianism|Arianism]], which was heretical according to the doctrine of the Catholic Church.

==Influence as a theologian and thinker==
[[Image:Tiffany Window of St Augustine - Lightner Museum.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Detail of St. Augustine in a [[stained glass window]] by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] in the [[Lightner Museum]], [[St. Augustine, Florida]].]]

Augustine remains a central figure, both within Christianity and in the history of Western thought.  In both his philosophical and theological reasoning, he was greatly influenced by [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]] and [[Neoplatonism]], particularly by the work of [[Plotinus]], author of the [[Enneads]], probably through the mediation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Victorinus]] (as [[Pierre Hadot]] has argued). His generally favorable outlook upon Neoplatonic thought contributed to the &quot;baptism&quot; of Greek thought and its entrance into the Christian and subsequently the [[European]] intellectual tradition. His early and influential writing on the [[Will (philosophy)|human will]], a central topic in [[ethics]], would became a focus for later philosophers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. 

It is largely due to Augustine's arguments against the [[Pelagians]], who did not believe in [[original sin]], that [[Western Christianity]] has maintained the doctrine of original sin. However, [[Eastern Orthodox]] theologians regard this part of his teaching to be an unwarranted innovation and a key source of division between East and West. 

Augustine's writings helped formulate the theory of [[The Just War Theory|the just war]]. He also advocated the use of force against the [[Donatism|Donatists]], asking &quot;Why ... should not the Church use force in compelling her lost sons to return, if the lost sons compelled others to their destruction?&quot; (''The Correction of the Donatists'', 22&amp;ndash;24)

Augustine's work ''[[The City of God]]'' heavily influenced works of [[Wincenty Kadlubek]] and [[Stanislaw of Skarbimierz]] on the relation between ruler and his subjects that led to the creation of [[Nobles' Democracy]] and &quot;De optimo senatore&quot; by [[Wawrzyniec Grzymala Goslicki]].

St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] took much from Augustine's theology while creating his own unique synthesis of Greek and Christian thought after the widespread rediscovery of the work of [[Aristotle]].

While Augustine's doctrine of divine [[predestination]] would never be wholly forgotten within the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]], finding eloquent expression in the works of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Reformation]] theologians such as [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] would look back to him as the inspiration for their avowed capturing of the Biblical Gospel.  Later, within the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]], the writings of [[Cornelius Jansen]], who claimed heavy influence from Augustine, would form the basis the movement known as [[Jansenism]]; some Jansenists went into [[schism]] and formed their own church.

Augustine was [[canonization|canonized]] by popular recognition and recognized as a [[Doctor of the Church]] in [[1303]] by [[Pope Boniface VIII]]. His [[feast day]] is [[August 28]], the day on which he is thought to have died. He is considered the [[patron saint]] of brewers, printers, theologians, sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses.

The latter part of Augustine's ''Confessions'' consists of an extended meditation on the nature of time.  Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine's belief that God exists [[eternity|outside of time]] in the &quot;eternal present&quot;; that time only exists within the created universe.  

Augustine's meditations on the nature of time are closely linked to his consideration of the human ability of [[memory]]. [[Frances Yates]] in her [[1966]] study, ''The Art Of Memory'' argues that a brief passage of the ''Confessions'', X.8.12, in which Augustine writes of walking up a flight of stairs and entering the vast fields of memory [http://www.stoa.org/hippo/text10.html#TB10C8S12 (see text and commentary)] clearly indicates that the ancient Romans were aware of how to use explicit spatial and architectural metaphors as a [[mnemonic]] technique for organizing large amounts of information. A few French philosophers have argued that this technique can be seen as the conceptual ancestor of the [[user interface]] [[paradigm]] of [[virtual reality]].

Augustine's writings also contain passages that have influenced thinkers in disciplines that did not exist in his day. Georg C.F. Greene of the [[Free Software Foundation]] considers a passage from Augustine's ''De Doctrina Christiana'' [http://gnuhh.org/work/fsf-europe/augustinus.html] to be one of the philosophical foundations of the [[free software movement]] with which he is involved.  In Book I, Chapter 1 of that work, Augustine writes, &quot;For if a thing is not diminished by being shared with others, it is not rightly owned if it is only owned and not shared.&quot;  Thus, Greve argues, knowledge, unlike physical possessions, must be freely shared.

According to [[Leo Ruickbie]], Augustine's arguments against [[magic]], differentiating it from [[miracle]], were crucial in the early Church's fight against [[paganism]] and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and [[witchcraft]].

== Augustine and the Jews ==
Augustine wrote in Book 18, Chapter 46 of ''[[The City of God]]'' [http://www.ccel.org/fathers/NPNF1-02/Augustine/cog/t103.htm] (one of his most celebrated works along with ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|The Confessions]]''): &quot;The Jews who slew [[Jesus|Him]], and would not believe in Him, because it behooved Him to die and rise again, were yet more miserably wasted by the Romans, and utterly rooted out from their kingdom, where aliens had already ruled over them, and were dispersed through the lands (so that indeed there is no place where they are not), and are thus by their own Scriptures a testimony to us that we have not forged the prophecies about Christ.&quot; 

Augustine deemed this scattering important because he believed that it was a fulfillment of certain prophecies, thus proving that Jesus was the [[Messiah]]. This is because Augustine believed that the Jews who were dispersed were the enemies of the Christian Church. He also quotes part of the same prophecy that says &quot;Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law&quot;. Some people have used Augustine's words to attack Jews as anti-Christian, while others have used them to attack Christians as anti-Jewish. See [[Christianity and anti-Semitism]].
