'''Aga Khan III''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: آغا خان الثالث), [[Imperial Privy Council|PC]] ([[November 2]], [[1877]] &amp;ndash; [[July 11]], [[1957]]), also known as '''Sultan Mahommed Shah''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: سلطان محمد شاه), was born in [[Karachi]] (then [[India]], now [[Pakistan]]) and was the only son of [[Aga Khan II]], and succeeded him on his death in [[1885]], becoming the head of the family.  Under the care of his mother, a daughter of the ruling house of [[Iran|Persia]], he was given not only that religious and oriental education which his position as the religious leader of the [[Ismailis]] made indispensable, but a sound [[Europe]]an training, a boon denied to his father and grandfather.  This blending of the two systems of education produced the happy result of fitting this [[Muslim]] chief in an eminent degree both for the sacerdotal functions which appertain to his spiritual position, and for those social duties required of a great and enlightened leader which he was called upon to discharge by virtue of his position. 

The Aga Khan travelled in distant parts of the world to receive the homage of his followers, and with the object either of settling differences or of advancing their welfare by pecuniary help and personal advice and guidance.  The distinction of a [[Order of the Indian Empire|Knight Commander of the Indian Empire]] was conferred upon him by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1897 (and later Knight Grand Commander in [[1902]] by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]) and he received like recognition for his public services from the German emperor, the sultan of Turkey, the shah of [[Iran|Persia]] and other potentates. In [[1934]] he was made a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].
The Aga Khan was also a founding member and President of the &quot;All India Muslim League,&quot; which advocated the division of United India in to Pakistan and India.

He was also an owner of thoroughbred racing horses, including five winners of the [[Epsom Derby]]. 

Bypassing his son [[Aly Khan]], he was succeeded by his grandson [[Aga Khan IV]]

*He married, in 1893, Shahazda Begum.
*He married, in 1903, Teresa Magliano.
*He married, in 1929, Andrée Joséphine Carron.
*He married, in 1944, Yvette Blanche Labrousse, elected &quot;Miss Lyon 1929&quot;, then &quot;Miss France 1930&quot;, named Om Habibah September 10, 1944,  and later called HH Begum Mata Salamat (Mother of the Peace)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Alexander Agassiz pers0118.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander Agassiz]]

'''Alexander Emanuel Agassiz''' ([[December 17]], [[1835]] &amp;ndash; [[March 27]], [[1910]]), son of [[Louis Agassiz]], was an [[United States|American]] scientist and engineer.

He was born in [[Neuchâtel]], [[Switzerland]] and emigrated to the [[United States]] with his father in [[1849]]. He graduated at [[Harvard]] in [[1855]], subsequently studying [[engineering]] and [[chemistry]], and taking the degree of [[bachelor of science]] at the [[Lawrence scientific school]] of the same institution in [[1857]]; and in [[1859]] became an assistant in the [[United States Coast Survey]].

Thenceforward he became a specialist in marine [[ichthyology]], but devoted much time to the investigation, superintendence and exploitation of [[mining|mine]]s. 
[[E. J. Hulbert]], a friend of Agassiz's brother-in-law, [[Quincy Adams Shaw]], had discovered a rich copper lode known as the [[Calumet conglomerate]] on the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] [[Lake Superior]] in [[Michigan]]. He persuaded them, along with a group of friends, to purchase a controlling interest in the mines, which later became known as the [[Calumet &amp; Hecla Mining Company]] based in [[Calumet, Michigan]]. Up until the summer of [[1866]], Agassiz worked as an assistant in the museum of natural history that his father founded at Harvard. That summer, he took a trip to see the mines for himself and he afterwards became treasurer of the enterprise. 

Over the winter of 1866 and early [[1867]], mining operations began to falter due to the difficulty of extracting copper from the conglomerate. Hulbert had sold his interests in the mines and had moved on to other ventures. But Agassiz refused to give up hope for the mines, and he returned to the mines in March of 1867 with his wife and young son. At that time, Keweenaw Peninsula was a remote settlement, virtually inaccessible during the winter and very far removed from civilization even during the summer. With insufficient supplies at the mines, Agassiz struggled to maintain order, while back in Boston, Shaw was saddled with debt and the collapse of their interests. Shaw obtained financial assistance from John Simpkins, the selling agent for the enterprise to continue operations. 

Agassiz continued to live at Calumet, making gradual progess in stablizing the mining operations, such that he was able to leave the mines under the control of a general manager and return to Boston in [[1868]] before winter closed navigation.

The mines continued to prosper and in May, [[1871]], several mines were consolidated to form the Calumet &amp; Hecla Mining Company with Shaw as its first president. In August, 1871, Shaw &quot;retired&quot; to the board of directors and Agassiz became president, a position he held until his death.

Agassiz was a major factor in the mine's continued success and visited the mines twice a year. He innovated by installing a giant engine, known as the Superior, which was able to lift 24 tons of rock from a depth of 4,000 feet. He also built a railroad and dredged a channel to navigable waters. However, after a time the mines did not require his full-time year-round attention and he returned to his interests in natural history at Harvard.

Out of his copper fortune, he gave some $500,000 to Harvard for the museum of comparative [[zoology]] and other purposes.

In [[1875]] he surveyed [[Lake Titicaca]], [[Peru]], examined the [[copper]] mines of Peru and [[Chile]], and made a collection of Peruvian antiquities for the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]], of which he was [[curator]] from [[1874]] to [[1885]].  He assisted [[Charles Wyville Thomson]] in the examination and classification of the collections of the ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' exploring expedition, and wrote the ''Review of the Echini'' (2 vols., 1872&amp;ndash;1874) in the reports.

Between [[1877]] and [[1880]] he took part in the three [[dredging]] expeditions of the steamer ''Blake'' of the Coast Survey, and presented a full account of them in two volumes ([[1888]]).

Of his other writings on marine zoology, most are contained in the bulletins and memoirs of the museum of comparative zoology; but he published in [[1865]] (with [[Elizabeth Cary Agassiz]], his step-mother) ''Seaside Studies in Natural History'', a work at once exact and stimulating, and in [[1871]] ''Marine Animals of [[Massachusetts]] Bay''.

He served as a president of the [[National Academy of Sciences]].

He died in [[1910]] onboard the [[SS Adriatic|SS ''Adriatic'']].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Agathon''' (c. [[448 BCE|448]]-[[400 BCE|400 BCE]]) was an Athenian tragic poet and friend of [[Euripides]] and [[Plato]].  He is best known from his mention by [[Aristophanes]] in his ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' and in Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]],'' which describes the banquet given to celebrate his obtaining a prize for his first tragedy ([[416 BCE|416]]).  He was the long time (10-15 years) beloved of Pausanias, also mentioned in the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' and ''[[Protagoras (Plato)|Protagoras]]''.  Pausanias followed Agathon to  the court of [[Archelaus I of Macedon|Archelaus]], king of [[Macedon]], who was recruiting playwrights.  This is where Agathon probably died.  He introduced certain innovations, and [[Aristotle]] (''Poetica,'' 9) tells us that the plot of his ''Antho'' was 
original, not, as usually, borrowed from mythological subjects. 

He is introduced, by Plato, as a handsome young man, well dressed, of polished manners, courted by the fashion, wealth and wisdom of [[Athens]], and dispensing hospitality with ease and refinement. The [[Epideixis]], in praise of love, which he recites in the Symposium, is full of the artificial and rhetorical expressions which might be expected from a former pupil of [[Gorgias]]. Aristotle tells us that he was the first to introduce into the drama arbitrary choral songs, which had nothing to do with the subject, and that he wrote pieces with fictitious names, which appear to have been half way between the idyl and comedy. His intimacy with Aristophanes doubtless saved him from many well-deserved strictures, though in one of his comedies, the latter burlesques his flowery style, representing him as a delicate and effeminate youth, and it may be only for the sake of punning on his name that he makes Dionysus call him a noble poet.

Agathon was a friend of [[Euripides]], accompanying him to the court of Archelaus of Macedon, where he died about 402 BCE. He had all the faults, without the genius, of his famous contemporary, and these he carried to excess, attempting to surprise the spectators with unexpected developments and strange, improbable dénouments. Add to this his fondness for [[epigram]], antitheses and other rhetorical embellishments, after the fashion of Gorgias, and no wonder that whatever he possessed of ability was smothered beneath his mannerisms. Yet, of the latter, he appears to have been proud, considering them essential to his verse; for when asked to purge himself of such blemishes, he replied: &quot;You do not see that that would be to purge Agathon's play of Agathon.&quot; His poetry was full of trope, inflection and metaphor; glittering with sparkling ideas and flowing softly along, with harmonious words and nice construction, but lacking in the element of truly virile expression and deficient in manly thought and vigor. With him begins the decline of tragic art in its higher sense.

See: Aristophanes, ''Thesmoph.'' 59, 106, ''Eccles.'' 100

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Agesilaus II''', or '''Agesilaos II''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] '''Ἀγησιλάος'''),  king of [[Sparta]], of the [[Eurypontid]] family, was the son of [[Archidamus II]] and Eupolia, and younger step-brother of [[Agis II]], whom he succeeded about [[401 BC]]. Agis had, indeed, a son [[Leotychides]], but he was set aside as illegitimate, current rumour representing him as the son of [[Alcibiades]].  Agesilaus' success was largely due to [[Lysander]], who hoped to find in him a willing tool for the furtherance of his political designs; in this hope, however, Lysander was disappointed, and the increasing power of Agesilaus soon led to his downfall.

In [[396 BC]] Agesilaus was sent to Asia with a force of 2000 Neodamodes (enfranchized Helots) and 6000 allies to secure the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] cities against a [[Persian Empire|Persian]] attack.  On the eve of sailing from [[Aulis]] he attempted to offer a sacrifice, as [[Agamemnon]] had done before the [[Troy|Trojan]] expedition, but the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] intervened to prevent it, an insult for which he never forgave them. On his arrival at [[Ephesus]] a three months' truce was concluded with [[Tissaphernes]], the [[satrap]] of [[Lydia]] and [[Caria]], but negotiations conducted during that time proved fruitless, and on its termination Agesilaus raided [[Phrygia]], where he easily won immense booty since [[Tissaphernes]] had concentrated his troops in Caria.  After spending the winter in organizing a [[cavalry]] force, he made a successful incursion into [[Lydia]] in the spring of [[395 BC]]. [[Tithraustes]] was thereupon sent to replace Tissaphernes, who paid with his life for his continued failure.  An armistice was concluded between Tithraustes and Agesilaus, who left the southern satrapy and again invaded [[Phrygia]], which he ravaged until the following spring.  He then came to an agreement with the satrap [[Pharnabazus]] and once more turned southward.

It was said that he was planning a campaign in the interior, or even an attack on [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] himself, when he was recalled to [[Greece]] owing to the war between Sparta and the combined forces of [[Athens]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], [[Argos]] and several minor states.  A rapid march through [[Thrace]] and [[Macedon]]ia brought him to [[Thessaly]], where he repulsed the Thessalian cavalry who tried to impede him. Reinforced by [[Phocis|Phocian]] and [[Orchomenus|Orchomenian]] troops and a Spartan army, he met the confederate forces at [[Chaeronea]] in [[Boeotia]], and in a hotly contested battle was 
technically victorious, but the success was a barren one and he had to retire by way of [[Delphi]] to the [[Peloponnese]]. Shortly before this battle the Spartan [[navy]], of which he had received the supreme command, was totally defeated off [[Knidos|Cnidus]] by a powerful Persian fleet under [[Conon]] and [[Pharnabazus]]. 

Subsequently Agesilaus took a prominent part in the [[Corinthian War]], making several successful expeditions into Corinthian territory and capturing [[Lechaeum]] and [[Piraeus]].  The loss, however, of a mora, destroyed by [[Iphicrates]], neutralized these successes, and Agesilaus returned to Sparta.  In [[389 BC]] he conducted a campaign in [[Acarnania]], but 
two years later the [[Peace of Antalcidas]], warmly supported by Agesilaus, put an end to hostilities.  When war broke out afresh with Thebes the king twice invaded [[Boeotia]] 
([[378 BC]], [[377 BC]]), and it was on his advice that [[Cleombrotus]] was ordered to march against Thebes in [[371 BC]]. Cleombrotus was defeated at Leuctra and the Spartan supremacy overthrown.  

In [[370 BC]] Agesilaus tried to restore Spartan prestige by an invasion of [[Mantinea]]n territory, and his prudence and heroism saved Sparta when her enemies, led by [[Epaminondas]], penetrated [[Laconia]] that same year, and again in [[362 BC]] when they all but succeeded in seizing the city by a rapid and unexpected march. The [[battle of Mantinea (362 BC)]], in which Agesilaus took no part, was followed by a general peace: Sparta, however, stood aloof, hoping even yet to recover her supremacy.  In order to gain money for prosecuting the war Agesilaus had supported the revolted [[satrap]]s, and in [[361 BC]] he went to [[Egypt]] at the head of a [[mercenary]] force to aid [[Tachos]] against Persia.  He soon transferred his services to Tachos's cousin and rival [[Nectanebo II]], who, in return for his help, gave him a sum of over 200 talents.  On his way home Agesilaus died at the age of 83, after a reign of some 41 years.

Agesilaus was of small stature and unimpressive appearance, and was somewhat lame from birth. These facts were used as an argument against his succession, an [[oracle]] having warned Sparta against a &quot;lame reign.&quot; He was a successful leader in [[guerrilla warfare]], alert and quick, yet cautious--a man, moreover, whose personal bravery was unquestioned.  As a statesman he won himself both enthusiastic adherents and bitter enemies, but of his patriotism there can be no doubt.  He lived in the most frugal style alike at home and in the field, and though his campaigns were undertaken largely to secure booty, he was content to enrich the state and his friends and to return as poor as he had set forth. The worst trait in his character is his implacable hatred of Thebes, which led directly to the [[battle of Leuctra]] and Sparta's fall from her position of supremacy.

According to [[Plutarch]], he was once asked whether he wanted a memorial erected in his honour.  He replied, “If I have done any noble action, that is a sufficient memorial; if I have done nothing noble, all the statues in the world will not preserve my memory.”  (In [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Εἰ γὰρ τι καλὸν ἔργον πεποίηκα, τοῦτο μνημεῖον ἐστίν; εἰ δὲ μηδὲν, οὐδ' οἱ πάντες ἀνδριάντες.)

His daughter [[Cynisca]] became the only woman in ancient history to win at the [[ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Antonio Cardinal Agliardi''' ([[September 4]], [[1832]] &amp;ndash; [[May 1]], [[1915]]) was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]], [[archbishop]], and papal diplomat. He was born at  Cologno ([[province of Bergamo|Bergamo]]), [[Italy]].

He studied [[theology]] and [[canon law]], and after acting as parish priest in his native diocese for twelve years was sent by the [[pope]] to [[Canada]] as a [[bishop]]'s [[chaplain]]. On his return he was appointed secretary to the [[Congregation of the Propaganda]].

In [[1884]], he was created by [[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]] [[archbishop of Caesarea]] ''in partibus'' and sent to [[India]] as an [[Apostolic Delegate]] to report on the establishment of the [[hierarchy]] there.

In [[1887]] he again visited India, to carry out the terms of the [[concordat]] arranged with [[Portugal]]. The same year he was appointed secretary to the Congregation ''super negotiis ecclesiae extraordinariis'', in [[1889]] became papal [[nuncio]] at [[Munich]] and in [[1892]] at [[Vienna]]. Allowing himself to be involved in the ecclesiastical disputes by which [[Hungary]] was divided 
in [[1895]], he was made the subject of formal complaint by the Hungarian government and in [[1896]] was recalled.

In the [[consistery]] of 1896 he was elevated to [[Cardinal Priest]] of ''[[Ss. Nereo ed Acheillo]]'''.  In [[1899]] he was made [[Cardinal Bishop]] of [[Albano]]. In [[1903]], he was named vice-chancellor of the Catholic Church, and became the Chancellor of the [[Apostolic Chancery]] in the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Secretariat of State]] in [[1908]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Agnes Maria of Andechs-Meran''' (d. [[1201]]), queen of [[France]], was the daughter of [[Bertold IV]] (d. [[1251]]), who was independent Count of [[Andechs]], a castle and territory near [[Ammersee]], [[Bavaria]] and  from  [[1183]] duke of [[Meran]] in [[Tirol]], which has derived its name from his castle Tyrol, above the valley of Meran. The count held his fiefs directly from the Emperor, so he was independent of the great territorial dukes of [[Germany]]. Bertold IV was made Archbishop of [[Kalocsa]] (in [[Hungary]]) and in [[1218]] he was made [[Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquileia]]. 

She is called Marie by some of the French chroniclers. In June [[1196]] she married [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] (Philip II), king of France, who had repudiated his second wife [[Ingeborg of Denmark]] in [[1193]].  [[Pope Innocent III]] espoused the cause of Ingeborg; but Philip did not submit until [[1200]], when, nine months after [[interdict]] had been added to [[excommunication]], he consented to a separation from Agnes. She died broken-hearted in July of the next year, at the castle of [[Poissy]], and was buried in the church of [[St. Corentin]], near [[Nantes]]. Her two children by Philip II, [[Philip, count of Clermont]] (d. [[1234]]), and Mary, who married Philip, [[Marquis of Namur|count of Namur]], were legitimized by the pope in [[1201]] at the request of the king. Little is known of the personality of Agnes, beyond the remarkable influence which she seems to have exercised over Philip II. She has been made the heroine of a [[tragedy]] by [[François Ponsard]], ''Agnès de Méranie''.

Her sister [[Hedwig of Andechs]] married [[Henry I, duke of Silesia]] and was canonized as Saint Hedwig in [[1267]]. Another sister, [[Gertrude of Meran|Gertrude]] was Queen of Hungary.

----


'''Agni''' is a [[Hindu]] deity.  The word ''agni'' is [[Sanskrit]] for &quot;fire&quot; (noun), cognate with [[Latin]] ''ignis'' ''Ignite''

In [[Hinduism]], he is a [[deva]], second only to [[Indra]] in the power and importance attributed to him in [[Vedic mythology]].  He is [[Indra]]'s twin, and therefore a son of [[Dyaus Pita]] and [[Prthivi]]. While in other version, he is a son of [[Kasyapa]] and [[Aditi]] or a Queen who kept her pregnancy secret from her husband. He has ten mothers, or ten sisters, or ten maidservants, who represent the ten fingers of the man who lights the fire. He has two parents: these represent the two sticks which, when rubbed together swiftly, create fire (called a fire drill). Some say that he destroyed his parents when he was born because they could not care for him. He is married to [[Svaha]] and father of [[Karttikeya]] by either Svaha or [[Ganga]]. He is one of the [[Ashta-Dikpalas]], representing the southeast.

His name is the first word of the first hymn of the [[Rigveda]]:-
&lt;br&gt;&amp;#2309;&amp;#2367;&amp;#2386;&amp;#2327;&amp;#2381;&amp;#2344;&amp;#2350;&amp;#2381; &amp;#2312;&amp;#2385;&amp;#2355;&amp;#2375; &amp;#2346;&amp;#2369;&amp;#2352;&amp;#2379;&amp;#2386;&amp;#2367;&amp;#2361;&amp;#2385;&amp;#2340;&amp;#2306; &amp;#2351;&amp;#2332;&amp;#2381;&amp;#2334;&amp;#2386;&amp;#2360;&amp;#2381;&amp;#2351;&amp;#2385; &amp;#2342;&amp;#2375;&amp;#2357;&amp;#2386;&amp;#2350;&amp;#2381; &amp;#2315;&amp;#2367;&amp;#2386;&amp;#2340;&amp;#2381;&amp;#2357;&amp;#2332;&amp;#2385;&amp;#2350;&amp;#2381; &amp;#2404;
&lt;br&gt;&amp;#2361;&amp;#2379;&amp;#2340;&amp;#2366;&amp;#2385;&amp;#2352;&amp;#2306; &amp;#2352;&amp;#2340;&amp;#2381;&amp;#2344;&amp;#2343;&amp;#2366;&amp;#2386;&amp;#2340;&amp;#2385;&amp;#2350;&amp;#2350;&amp;#2381; &amp;#2405;
&lt;br&gt;''agn&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;m &amp;#299;&amp;#316;e pur&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;hitam'' 
/ ''yajñ&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;sya dev&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;m &amp;#343;tv&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;jam'' 
/ ''hot&amp;#257;raM ratnadh&lt;u&gt;&amp;#257;&lt;/u&gt;tamam.''
&lt;br&gt;(The vowels which are underlined here, carry the Vedic ''ud&amp;#257;tta'' [[pitch accent]].)
&lt;br&gt;&quot;I praise Agni, the priest of the house, the divine ministrant of sacrifice, the invoker, the best bestower of treasure.&quot; 

The sacrifices made to Agni go to the [[deity|deities]] because Agni is a messenger from and to the other gods. He is ever-young, because the fire is re-lit every day; but also he is immortal. 

In some stories about the Hindu gods, Agni is the one who is sent to the front in dangerous situations.

Another hymn runs: &quot;No god indeed, no mortal is beyond the might of thee, the mighty One.&quot;. He lives among men and is miraculously reborn each day by the fire-drill, the friction of the two sticks which are regarded as his parents. He is the supreme director of [[religion|religious]] ceremonies and duties, and even has the power of influencing the fate of each man in the future world. Agni is also representative of the power which [[digestion|digests]] the food in every person's [[stomach]]. He created the [[star]]s with the sparks resulting from his flames.

He is worshipped under a threefold form: fire on [[earth]] and [[lightning]] and the [[sun]]. His cult survived the change of the ancient Vedic nature-worship into modern [[Hinduism]], and there are fire-priests (agnihotr) whose duty is to watch over his worshippers. The sacred fire-drill for procuring the temple-fire by friction -- symbolic of Agni's daily miraculous birth -- is still used.

In Hindu [[art]], Agni is represented as [[red]] and two-faced (sometimes covered with [[butter]]), suggesting both his destructive and beneficent qualities, and with [[black]] [[eye]]s and [[hair]], three [[Human leg|legs]] and seven [[arm]]s. He rides a [[ram (sheep)|ram]], or a [[chariot]] pulled by [[goat]]s or, more rarely, [[parrot]]s. Seven rays of light emanate from his body.

The [[Rigveda]] often says that Agni arises from water or dwells in the waters. He may have originally been the same as [[Apam Napat]], which see.

Although the Vedic fire-sacrifice ([[yagya]]) has largely disappeared from modern Hinduism, Agni with the fire-sacrifice is still the mode of ritual in any modern Hindu marriage, where Agni is said to be the chief '''sakshi''' or witness of the marriage and guardian of the santity of marriage. Indeed, without seven encirclements around the holy fire, the modern Hindu Marriage Act of law regards a Hindu marriage as void.

==Agni in other faiths and religions==
In [[Zoroastrianism]], he is [[Atar]], literally, [[fire]], which symbolically represents the life-animating force radiating from [[Ahura Mazda]]. In Indo-Tibetan [[Buddhism]], he is a [[lokapala]] guarding the South-East. (see e.g. ''jigten lugs kyi bstan bcos:'' = &quot;Make your hearth in the South-East corner of the house, which is the quarter of Agni&quot;). He also plays a central role in most Buddhist [[homa (ritual)|homa]] (fire-[[puja]]) rites.

'''Julia Vipsania Agrippina''' ([[14 October]]-[[18 October]] [[14 BC]]&amp;#8211; AD [[33]]), known as '''Agrippina Major''' ('''Agrippina &quot;the Elder&quot;'''), was one of the most powerful women in the [[Roman Empire]] in the early [[1st century]] AD. She was the daughter of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] by his third wife [[Julia Caesaris]], was grand-daughter of [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]], wife of [[Germanicus]], and the mother of [[Agrippina the younger|Agrippina Minor]] and [[Caligula]]. 

Agrippina was born in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. In AD 5 she had married Germanicus, her second cousin and step-grandson of the Emperor Augustus. The well-regarded Germanicus was a candidate for the succession and had won fame campaigning in [[Germania]] and [[Gaul]], where he was accompanied by Agrippina. This was most unusual for Roman wives, as convention required them to stay at home, and earned her a reputation as a model for heroic womanhood. She bore him two children in Gaul, a boy and [[Agrippina the younger|Agrippina Minor]] in the Rhine frontier.

Agrippina and Germanicus travelled to the [[Near East]] in AD 19, incurring the displeasure of the emperor [[Tiberius]]. He quarrelled with [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]], the governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], and died in [[Antioch]] in mysterious circumstances. It was widely suspected that Germanicus had been poisoned &amp;ndash; perhaps on the orders of Tiberius himself &amp;ndash; and Agrippina returned to Rome to avenge his death. She boldly accused Piso of the murder of Germanicus. To avoid public infamy, Piso committed suicide. 

From AD 19 to 29, Agrippina remained in Rome, becoming increasingly involved with a group of senators who opposed the growing power of Tiberius' favourite [[Sejanus]]. Her relations with the emperor became increasingly fraught as she made it clear that she believed that he was responsible for the death of Germanicus. Tiberius also evidently feared that she might seek to secure the throne for her own children. In 26, the emperor rejected her request that she be allowed to marry again.

Agrippina and her sons Drusus and [[Nero Caesar]] were arrested in 29 on the orders of Tiberius. They were tried by the Senate and Agrippina was banished to the island of Pandataria (now called [[Ventotene]]) in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] off the coast of [[Campania]], where she died on [[October 18]], [[33]] in suspicious circumstances. The official story was that she had starved herself to death, but it seems equally likely that she was starved on the orders of the emperor. After her death, Tiberius convinced the senate to revoke all her former privileges and declared her birthday to be a day of ill-omen.

Agrippina had nine children by Germanicus, several of whom died young. Drusus died of starvation after being imprisoned in Rome and Nero Caesar either committed suicide or was murdered after his trial in 29. Only two of her children are of historical importance: [[Agrippina the younger|Agrippina Minor]], also known as Agrippina the Younger, and Gaius Caesar, who succeeded Tiberius under the name of [[Caligula]]. Despite Tiberius' enmity towards Caligula's elder brothers, he nonetheless made Caligula and his cousin [[Tiberius Gemellus]] joint heirs to his property.

Agrippina was regarded by contemporaries as being a woman of the highest character and exemplary Roman morals. There is a portrait of her in the [[Capitoline Museums]] at [[Rome]] and a bronze medal in the [[British Museum]] showing her ashes being brought back to [[Rome]] by order of Caligula.

'''Julia Vipsania Agrippina Minor''' or ''' Agrippina Minor''' (Latin for &quot;the younger&quot;) ([[November 7]], [[15|AD 15]] &amp;ndash; March [[59]]), often called &quot;'''Agrippinilla'''&quot; to distinguish her from her mother, was the daughter of [[Germanicus]] and [[Agrippina the elder|Agrippina Major]]. She was sister of [[Caligula]], great granddaughter of [[Augustus]], granddaughter and great-niece of [[Tiberius]], niece and wife of [[Claudius]], and the mother of [[Nero]].  She was born at Oppidum Ubiorum on the [[Rhine]], afterwards named in her honour Colonia Agrippinae (modern [[Cologne]], Germany).  

Agrippina's first marriage was to consul (1st century AD) [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]]. From this marriage she gave birth to Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, who would become [[Roman Emperor]] [[Nero]]. Her husband died in January, [[40]]. While still married, Agrippina participated openly in her brother Caligula's decadent court, where, according to some sources, at his instigation she prostituted herself in a palace. While it was generally agreed that Agrippinilla, as well as her sisters, had ongoing sexual relationships with their brother Caligula, incest was an oft-used criminal accusation against the aristocracy, because it was impossible to refute successfully. As Agrippina and her sister became more problematic for their brother, Caligula sent them into exile for a time, where it is said she was forced to dive for sponges to make a living.  In January, [[41]], Agrippina had a second marriage to the affluent [[Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus]]. He died between [[44]] and [[47]], leaving his estate to Agrippina. 

As a widow, Agrippina was courted by the freedman Pallas as a possible marriage match to her own uncle, Emperor [[Claudius]], and became his favourite councillor, even granted the honor of being called Augusta (a title which no other queen had ever received). They were married on New Year's Day of [[49]], after the death of Claudius's previous wife [[Messalina]] due her part in a failed coup attempt. As his wife, she commanded Roman legions and Celtic captives assumed that she, not Claudius, was the martial leader and bowed before her throne instead of his.

Agrippina then proceeded to persuade Claudius to adopt her son, thereby placing Nero in the line of succession to the Imperial throne over Claudius's own son, [[Britannicus]]. A true Imperial politician, Agrippina did not reject murder as a way to win her battles. Many ancient sources credited her with poisoning Claudius in [[54]] with a plate of poison mushrooms, hence enabling Nero to quickly take the throne as emperor.

For some time, Agrippina influenced Nero as he was relatively ill-equipped to rule on his own. But Nero eventually felt that she was taking on too much power relative to her position as a woman of Rome. He deprived her of her honours and exiled her from the palace, but that was not enough. Three times Nero tried to poison Agrippina, but she had been raised in the Imperial family and was accustomed to taking antidotes. Nero had a machine built and attached to the roof of her bedroom. The machine was designed to make the ceiling collapse &amp;mdash; the plot failed with the machine. According to the historians [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] and [[Suetonius]], Nero then plotted her death by sending for her in a boat constructed to collapse, intending to [[drowning | drown]] Agrippina. However, only some of the crew were in on the plot; their efforts were hampered by the rest of the crew trying to save the ship. As the ship sank, one of her handmaidens thought to save herself by crying that she was Agrippina, thinking they would take special care of her. Instead the maid was instantly beaten to death with oars and chains. The real Agrippina realised  what was happening and in the confusion managed to swim away where a passing fisherman picked her up. Terrified that his cover had been blown, Nero instantly sent men to charge her with treason and summarily execute her. Legend states that when the Emperor's soldiers came to kill her, Agrippina pulled back her clothes and ordered them to stab her in the belly that had housed such a monstrous son.

      <comment>/* American vs. Traditional menus */ authentic vegetables just as common in china as european vegetables in american chinese cuisine</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Cuisine_of_China}}

'''American Chinese cuisine''' is a unique style of cooking served by Chinese [[restaurants]] in the [[United States]]. This new type of cooking was created for [[Western World|Western]] tastes, but Westerners exposed only to this variety may not realize that it differs from the [[Chinese cuisine|cuisine of China]]. Some restaurants advertise their status by writing &quot;Western food&quot; on their signs in [[hanzi|Chinese]]. It deters those who seek more traditional dishes, while still attracting those who are either unable to read Chinese or are looking for westernized fare. [[Canadian Chinese cuisine]] is quite similar to American Chinese cuisine.

== History ==

In the 19th century, Chinese restaurateurs invented American Chinese cuisine when they modified their food for American tastes. First catering to [[railroad]] workers, they opened restaurants in towns where Chinese food was completely unknown. 

The influx of immigrants in the late 20th century disdained the Americanized dishes, preferring more traditional Chinese food. Classical Chinese cuisine now dominates major cities like [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and [[New York, New York|New York]].

But American Chinese cuisine remains, especially in places with few [[Chinese American]]s. One finds Americanized cuisine in &quot;[[mom and pop]]&quot; [[restaurant|restaurants]], &quot;tourist trap&quot; [[diner|diners]], and small town restaurants.  [[Panda Express]] and Manchu WOK are popular franchise restaurants that offer Westernized dishes in shopping malls.

==American vs. Traditional menus==

American Chinese food treats vegetables as garnish while authentic styles emphasize vegetables.  Authentic Chinese cuisine makes frequent use of Asian leafy vegetables like [[bok choy]] and [[gai-lan]], and puts a greater emphasis on [[seafood]]. American Chinese food is usually less pungent than authentic cuisine.

[[Image:Chinese buffet2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A Chinese buffet restaurant in the U.S.]]
American Chinese food tends to be cooked very quickly with lots of oil and salt. Many dishes are quickly and easily prepared, and require inexpensive ingredients. [[Stir-frying]], [[Pan frying|pan-frying]], and [[deep-frying]] tend to be the most common cooking techniques which are all easily done using a [[wok]]. The food also has a reputation for high levels of [[Monosodium glutamate|MSG]] to enhance the flavor; the symptoms of MSG sensitivity have been dubbed &quot;[[Chinese restaurant syndrome]]&quot; or &quot;Chinese food syndrome&quot;.  While there is heated scientific debate over whether or not MSG is harmful, market forces and customer demand have enouraged many restaurants to offer &quot;MSG Free&quot; or &quot;No MSG&quot; menus.

Most American Chinese establishments cater to non-Chinese customers, and their menus are written in English. Those that do have Chinese menus, have ones that are different from the English version. Americanized menus might exclude some foods which the Chinese consider delicacies, like liver, and chicken feet. Americanized menus often include:

* [[Batter-fried meat]] &amp;mdash; Meat that has been deep fried in bread or flour, such as ''sesame chicken'', ''lemon chicken'',  ''orange chicken'', ''[[sweet and sour pork]]'', and ''[[General Tso's chicken]]'' is often overemphasized in American-style Chinese dishes.  Battered meat occasionally appears in [[Hunan_cuisine|Hunanese]] dishes, but it generally uses lighter sauces with less sugar and corn syrup.
**The [[chicken ball]] uses a large amount of leavening and flour in its preparation and battering process which causes them to be more similar to doughy &quot;[[Hushpuppy|hush puppies]]&quot; than actual batter-fried meat.
* [[Chinese chicken salad]] &amp;mdash; Salad is not a Chinese dish. This is a 100% western dish. It is served in Chinese restaurants, because it contains crispy noodle (fried wonton skin) and sesame dressing. Some restaurants serve the salad with Mandarin Orange.
* [[Chop suey]] &amp;mdash; Connotes &quot;leftovers&quot; in Chinese. It is usually a mix of vegetables and meat in a brown sauce.
* [[Chow mein]] &amp;mdash; literally means 'stir-fried noodles'. Chow mein consists of fried noodles with bits of meat and vegetables. 
* [[Crab rangoon]] &amp;mdash; Fried [[wonton]] skins stuffed with artificial crab meat and cream cheese, originally served at [[Trader Vic]]'s restaurant in the 1950s.
* [[Egg foo young]] also egg foo yung
* [[Egg roll]] &amp;mdash; While Chinese [[spring roll|spring rolls]] have a thin crispy skin with mushrooms, bamboo, and other vegetables inside, the New York version uses a thick, fried skin stuffed with cabbage.  In other areas, [[bean sprout]]s form the basis of most of the filling.  Other American versions remain closer in similarity to their spring roll style authentic counterparts.
*[[Fortune cookie]] &amp;mdash; Invented at the Japanese Tea Garden restaurant in [[San Francisco]], fortune cookies became sweetened and found their way to American Chinese restaurants. Fortune cookies have become so popular in the U.S., that even some authentic Chinese restaurants serve them at the end of the meal. Some are even produced with Chinese-language translations of the English-language fortunes.
* [[Fried rice]] &amp;mdash; Fried rice dishes are popular offerings in American Chinese food due to the speed and ease of preparation and their appeal to western tastes. Fried rice is generally prepared with rice cooled overnight, so this allows restaurants to put unserved leftover rice to good use.  
* [[Lo mein]] &amp;mdash; This is a New York-style Chinese food oddity.  &quot;Lo mein&quot; in New York is closer to &quot;[[chow mein]]&quot; in the rest of the country. Strictly the term means &quot;mixed noodles&quot;, that is one made with eggs, as opposed to most noodles which are made without egg.
* [[Moo shu pork]] &amp;mdash; The Chinese version uses more authentic ingredients (including [[wood ear]] fungi and [[daylily]] buds) and thin flour pancakes while the American version uses more Western vegetables and thicker pancakes.
* [[Shrimp toast]] &amp;mdash; Triangles of bread, coated with egg, [[shrimp]], and [[water chestnut]]s, and then deep-fried or baked.
* [[Wonton soup]] &amp;mdash; The soup noodle does not exist in American Chinese cuisine, while it is ubiquitous in many authentic styles.  The closest popular example would be [[ramen]].  The true Cantonese Wonton Soup is a full meal in itself consisting of thin egg noodles and a few wontons in a pork soup broth.

==Regional Variations on American Chinese cuisine==
===San Francisco===
Since the early 1990s, many American Chinese restaurants influenced by the [[Cuisine of California]] have opened in [[San Francisco]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]. The trademark dishes of American Chinese cuisine remain on the menu, but there is more emphasis on fresh vegetables, and the selection is vegetarian-friendly. 

The new cuisine has exotic ingredients like [[mango]]es and [[portobello mushroom]]s. Other cuisines influence the menu: some restaurants substitute grilled flour tortillas for the rice pancakes in mu shu dishes; [[brown rice]] is often offered as an optional alternative to [[white rice]].

[[Chop suey]] is not widely available in [[San Francisco]], and the city's chow mein is different from Midwestern chow mein.

Authentic restaurants with Chinese-language menus may offer 黃毛鶏 (Yale Cantonese: wòhng mouh gāai [Pinyin huang mao ji], literally yellow-hair chicken), essentially a [[free range|free-range]] chicken, as opposed to typical American mass-farmed chicken. Yellow-hair chicken is valued for its flavor, but needs to be cooked properly to be tender due to its lower fat and higher muscle content. This dish usually does not appear on the English-language menu.

Dauh Miu (Pinyin: Dou Meo), literally Bean Grass but actually snow pea vines, is a Chinese vegetable that has become popular since the early 1990s, and now not only appears on English-language menus, usually as &quot;pea shoots&quot;, but is often served by upscale non-Asian restaurants as well.  Originally it was only available during a few months of the year, but it is now grown in greenhouses and is available year-round.

===Hawaii===
Owing to the different history of the [[Chinese in Hawaii]], Hawaiian Chinese food developed a bit differently from the continental United States. Owing to the diversity of ethnicities in Hawaii, Chinese cuisine forms a component of the [[cuisine of Hawaii]], which is a [[fusion cuisine|fusion]] of different culinary traditions. Some Chinese dishes are typically served as part of [[plate lunch]]es in Hawaii. Some names of foods are different like ''[[Manapua|manapua]]'' from Hawaiian meaning ''chewed up pork'' for the dim sum ''bao'', not just the pork variety. As is typical in Hawaii, Chinese food in Hawaii is also noted for its use of [[SPAM]], much to the puzzlement of outsiders.
===Springfield, Missouri===
[[Springfield, Missouri]] has numerous Chinese restaurants with a specialized dish:  [[cashew chicken]].  It was invented at Leong's Tea House in Springfield and is responsible for the large numbers of Chinese restaurants in the city.  The dish has spread to several other cities, where it is sometimes known as &quot;Springfield-style cashew chicken&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Ahenobarbus''''' (&quot;brazen-bearded&quot; or &quot;red-haired&quot;) is the name of a plebeian [[Roman Republic|Roman]] family of the ''[[gens]]'' Domitia.  The name was derived from the red beard and hair by which many of the family were distinguished.  Amongst its members the following may be mentioned: 

* '''Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus''', consul [[192 BC]]

* '''Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus''', consul [[122 BC]].  As [[proconsul]] in 121 BC, successfully fought against the [[Allobroges]], a [[Gallic]] tribe, in retaliation for their attacks on [[Rome]]'s Allies, the [[Aedui]].  Was subsequently elected [[Censor]] with Lucius Caeilius Metellus, and removed 32 members from the Senate.  Father of the following.

* '''Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus''', son of the same named consul of 122 BC,  tribune of the people [[104 BC]], brought forward a law (''lex Domitia de Sacerdotiis'') by which the priests of the superior colleges were to be elected by the people in the ''comitia tributa'' (seventeen of the tribes voting) instead of by co-optation; the law was repealed by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], revived by [[Julius Caesar]] and (perhaps) again repealed by [[Mark Antony]], the triumvir ([[Cicero]], ''De Lege Agraria,'' ii. 7; [[Suetonius]], ''Nero,'' 2). Ahenobarbus was elected pontifex maximus in [[103 BC]], consul in [[96 BC]] and censor in [[92 BC]] with Lucius Licinius Crassus the [[orator]], with whom he was frequently at variance.  They took joint action, however, in suppressing the recently established Latin rhetorical schools, which they regarded as injurious to public morality ([[Aulus Gellius]] xv. 11). 

* '''Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus''', consul [[94 BC]]

* '''Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus''', son of Gn. Domitius Ahenobarbus cos 96 BC, husband of Porcia Catones the sister of [[Cato the younger]], friend of [[Cicero]] and enemy of [[Julius Caesar]], and a strong supporter of the aristocratical party.  At first strongly opposed to [[Pompey]], he afterwards sided with him against Caesar.  He was consul in [[54 BC]], and in 49 he was appointed by the senate to succeed Caesar as governor of Gaul.  After the outbreak of the civil war he commanded the Pompeian troops at Corfinium, but was obliged to surrender.  Although treated with great generosity by Caesar, he stirred up Massilia (today's [[Marseille]]) to an unsuccessful resistance against him.  After its surrender, he joined Pompey in [[Greece]] and was slain in the flight after the [[battle of Pharsalus]], in which he commanded the right wing against Antony (Caesar, ''Bellum Civile,'' i., ii., iii.; Dio Cassius xxxix., xli.; Appian, ''B.C.'' ii. 82). 

* '''[[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (1st century BC)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]]''', son of the above, ally of Mark Antony and later of [[Augustus]].

* '''Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus''', the only child of the above Gn. Domitius and Aemilia Lepida. His mother was a paternal cousin to triumvir [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]]. His paternal grandmother was [[Porcia Catones]]. He won an honorary [[Roman triumph|triumph]], by penetrating deeper into Germany, than anyone else before him. As a youngman he was a famous charioteer. [[Suetonius]] describes as 'arrogant, cruel, notorius and extravagant'. Lucius held the office of aedile. As praetor and consul made married knights and married women star in pantomimes. He enjoyed presenting gladiatorial contests and wild animal hunts. In Augustus' will he was nominated to purchase his household possessions. Lucius married [[Antonia Major]], Augustus' niece. They had [[Domitia Lepida Major]], Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and [[Domitia Lepida]]. Lucius died in 
AD [[25]].

* '''[[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (1st century AD)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]]''', son of the above, father of [[Nero]].

* '''Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus''' ('''[[Nero]]'''), fifth [[Roman Emperor]] and son of the above.

[[Image:Ahmad Shah Durrani.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Ahmad Shah Durrani]]

'''Ahmad Shah''' ('''احمد شاہ''') (1773–1724), also known as '''Ahmad Shah Abdali''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: احمد شاہ ابدالی), founder of the [[Durrani]] dynasty in [[Afghanistan]], was the son of Zaman-Khan, hereditary chief of the Abdali tribe. The name 'Durrani' or 'Durr-i-Durran' means the 'pearl of pearls' in Persian and was given to the Abdali tribe in [[1747]] when Ahmad Shah Abdali united the Pashtun tribes following a [[loya jirga]] and changed his own name to Ahmad Shah Durrani when he became the king of Afghanistan and founded the Durrani Empire. Ahmad Shah and his sons were the first [[Pashtun]] rulers of Afghanistan, from the [[Sadozai]] line of the Abdali or [[Durrani]] group of clans. It was under the leadership of Ahmad Shah that the nation of Afghanistan began to take shape following centuries of fragmentation and exploitation.

[[Nadir Shah]], then ruler of [[Persian Empire | Persia]], gave Ahmad Shah the command of a body of cavalry composed chiefly of Abdalis. On the assassination of [[Nadir Shah]] in 1747, Ahmad retreated to Afghanistan and persuaded local tribes to join him for a [[jihad]] against [[Hindu]]s. He took with him the [[Koh-i-noor]] diamond, given to him by [[Shah Rukh of Persia | Shah Rukh]], Nadir's grandson.

He first crossed the [[Indus river|Indus River]] in 1748, when he took [[Lahore]], and in 1751, he inflicted a heavy defeat on the Sikhs of Lahore. In 1750 he took [[Nishapur]], and in 1752 subdued [[Kashmir]]. In 1756 he stripped and looted every corner of [[Delhi]] and took the treasures of the [[Mughul Empire]]. In 1757, he attacked the Golden Temple in Amritsar once again and filled its sarovar (pond) with the blood of slaughtered cows. Perhaps this was the last straw that prompted the [[Maratha]] chiefs to declare holy war on Ahmad Shah. In 1758 the Marathas obtained possession of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], but in January 1761 they were routed by Ahmad in the great [[Third Battle of Panipat|Battle of Panipat]]. In a later expedition he inflicted a severe defeat upon the Sikhs, but had to hasten westward immediately afterwards in order to quell an insurrection in Afghanistan. Meanwhile the Sikhs again rose, and Ahmad was now forced to abandon all hope of retaining the command of the Punjab. He died in 1773, leaving to his son [[Timur Shah | Timur]] the great kingdom he had founded. Unfortunately, within 50 years after Ahmad's death, Afghanistan would be embroiled in civil war.

Even today there are thousands of people each year named their sons Ahmad Shah in tribute to the first Emir of Afghanistan.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Saint Aidan of Lindisfarne''' or Lindesfarne , the '''Apostle of Northumbria''' (died [[651]]), was the founder and first [[bishop]] of the [[monastery]] on the island of [[Lindisfarne]] in [[England]]. A [[Christianity|Christian]] [[missionary]], he is credited with restoring Christianity to [[Northumbria]].

An [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]]man, possibly born in [[Connacht]], Aidan was a [[monk]] at the monastery on the island of [[Iona]] in [[Scotland]].

The [[Roman Empire]] had spread Christianity into England, but due to its decline, [[paganism]] was seeing a resurgence in Northern England. [[Oswald of Northumbria]] had been living at the Iona monastery as a king in exile since [[616]] AD. There he converted to Christianity and was [[baptize|baptised]]. In [[634]] he gained the crown of Northumbria, and was determined to bring Christianity to the mostly pagan people there.

Due to his past at Iona, he requested missionaries from that monastery instead of the Roman-backed monasteries in England. At first the monastery sent a new bishop named Corman, but he returned to Iona and reported that the Northumbrians were too stubborn to be converted. Aidan criticised Corman's methods and was soon sent as a replacement in [[635]].

Aidan chose the island of [[Lindisfarne]], close to the royal castle at [[Bamburgh]], as his [[diocese]]. King Oswald, who spoke Irish, often had to translate for Aidan and his monks, who did not speak English at first. When Oswald died in [[642]], Aidan received continued support from King [[Oswine of Deira]] and the two became close friends.

An inspired missionary, Aidan would walk from one village to another, politely conversing with the people he saw and slowly interesting them in Christianity. According to legend, the king gave Aidan a horse so that he wouldn't have to walk, but Aidan gave the horse to a beggar. By patiently talking to the people on their own level Aidan and his monks slowly restored Christianity to the Northumbrian communities. Aidan also took in twelve English boys to train at the monastery, to ensure that the area's future religious leadership would be English.

In [[651]] a pagan army attacked Bamburgh and attempted to set its walls ablaze. According to legend, Aidan prayed for the city, after which the winds turned and blew the smoke and fire toward the enemy, repulsing them.

Aidan was a member of the Irish branch of Christianity instead of the Roman branch, but his character and energy in missionary work won him the respect of [[Pope Honorius I]] and [[Felix of Dunwich]].

Aidan's friend Oswine of Deira was murdered in [[651]]. Twelve days later Aidan died, on [[August 31]], in the 17th year of his [[bishop|episcopate]]. He had become ill while at the Bamburgh castle and died leaning against the wall of the local church.

The monastery he founded grew and helped found churches and other monasteries throughout the area. It also became a center of learning and a storehouse of scholarly knowledge. [[Saint Bede the Venerable]] would later write Aidan's biography and describe the miracles attributed to him. Saint Aidan's feast day is on [[August 31]]st.

'''''Ailanthus''''' (derived from ailanto, an [[Amboine]] word probably meaning &quot;tree of the gods&quot; or &quot;tree of heaven&quot;) is a genus of 6-10 species of [[tree]]s belonging to the family [[Simaroubaceae]], in the order [[Sapindales]] (formerly [[Rutales]] or [[Geraniales]]). The genus is native from east [[Asia]] south to northern [[Australasia]].

The best known species, ''[[A. altissima|Ailanthus altissima]]'', English name '''[[Tree of heaven]]''', is a native of northern [[China]]. It is a quick-growing [[deciduous]] tree to 25-35 m tall, with spreading branches and large (40-80 cm) pinnate leaves with 15-35 long pointed leaflets, the terminal leaflet normally present, and the basal pairs of leaflets often lobed at their bases. The small greenish flowers are borne on branched panicles; and the male ones are characterized by having a disgusting odour. The fruits are free in clusters, and each is drawn out into a long wing with the seed in the middle. The wood is fine grained and satiny. 

[[Image:Ailanthus altissima4.jpg|thumb|left|''Ailanthus altissima'' flowers]]
The tree was introduced into [[England]] in 1751 and is a favourite in parks and gardens. It has also been introduced into [[North America]]. This tree has the reputation as being among the most urban-tolerant of any temperate-zone trees in the world, growing in places where most [[weed]]s even refuse to grow. Where the climate is sufficiently similar to that of its homeland, as in much of the east and south of both the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], it has proved to be a serious problem [[invasive species]], causing major problems both in urban areas (where the roots of saplings that germinate close to buildings cause damage to foundations), and in rural areas (where it displaces native species from the environment). A consequent popular [[nickname]] for the species is '''Tree from hell'''.

''A. altissima'' is sometimes also known as ''A. glandulosa'' or ''A. glanduosa''. Under this name, an extract of the bark is sometimes touted as an herbal homeopathic remedy for various ailments. However, taken in large doses, the bark extract is highly toxic.

Other species of ''Ailanthus'' include ''A. triphysa'', an [[Australia]]n tree; ''A. vilmoriniana'' and ''A. giraldii'' in south and west China, ''A. malabarica'' in southeast [[Asia]], and ''A. excelsa'', common in [[India]].

A silk spinning moth, the Ailanthus moth (''Samia cynthia''), lives on its leaves, and yields a silk more durable and cheaper than mulberry silk, but inferior to it in fineness and gloss.  This moth has been introduced to the eastern United States and is common near many towns; it is about 12 cm across, with angulated wings, and in colour olive brown, with white markings. Other [[Lepidoptera]] whose [[larva]]e feed on ''Ailanthus'' include ''[[Endoclita|Endoclita malabaricus]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aimoin''' (c. [[960]]-c. [[1010]]), French chronicler, was born at Villefranche de Longchat about 960, and in early life entered the [[monastery]] of [[Fleury]], where he became a monk and 
passed the greater part of his life.

His chief work is a ''Historia Francorum'', or ''Libri v. de Gestis Francorum'', which deals with the history of the [[Franks]] from the earliest times to 653, and was continued by other writers until the 
middle of the [[12th century]]. It was much in vogue during the middle ages, but its historical value is now regarded as slight.  It has been edited by G. Waitz and published in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Scriptores'', Band xxvi. (Hanover and Berlin, 1826-1892).

He also wrote a ''Vita Abbonis'', ''abbatis Floriacensis'', the last of a series of lives of the [[abbot]]s of Fleury, all of which, except the life of [[Abbo of Fleury|Abbo]], have been lost.  This has been published by [[Jean Mabillon|J. Mabillon]] in the ''Acta sanctorum ordinis sancti Benedicti'' (Paris, 1668-1701).

Aimoin's third work was the composition of books ii. and iii. of the ''Miracula sancti Benedicti'', the first book of which was written by another monk of Fleury named Adrevald.  This also appears in the Acta sanctorum ordinis sancti Benedicti.

Aimoin, who died about 1010, must be distinguished from Aimoin, a monk of Saint-Germain-des-Pres, who wrote ''De miraculis sancti Germani'', and a fragment ''De Normanorum gestis circa Parisiacam urbem et de divine in eos ultione tempore Caroli calvi''.  Both of these are published in the ''Historiae Francorum Scriptores'', Tome ii. (Paris, 1639-1649).

'''Akkad''' (or '''Agade''') was a city and its region of northern [[Mesopotamia]], 
situated on the left bank of the [[Euphrates]], between [[Sippar]] and [[Kish]] (located in present-day [[Iraq]], ca. 50 km south-west of the center of [[Baghdad]], {{coor d|33.1|N|44.1|E}}). It reached the height of its power between the [[22nd century BC|22nd]] and [[18th century BC|18th]] centuries BC, before the rise of [[Babylonia]].

Akkad gave its name to the [[Akkadian language]], reflecting use of ''akkadû'' (&quot;in the language of Akkad&quot;) in the Old Babylonian period to denote the [[Semitic]] version of a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] text. It was built in the 23rd century BC.


==History== 
The earliest records in Akkadian date to the time of [[Sargon of Akkad]] ([[23rd century BC]]).  While Sargon is traditionally cited as the first ruler of a combined empire of Akkad and Sumer, more recent work suggests that a Sumerian expansion began under a previous king, [[Lugal-Zage-Si]] of [[Uruk]].  However, Sargon took this process further, conquering many of the surrounding regions to create an empire that reached as far as the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Anatolia]].

It is believed that Akkad was the largest city in the world from 2250 to 2075 BC.[http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm]

In the later [[Babylonia|Babylonian]] literature the name ''Akkad'', together with ''Sumer'', appears  as part of the royal title, as in the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''lugal Kengi (ki) Uru (ki)'' or [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''&amp;#154;ar m&amp;#257;t &amp;#138;umeri u Akkadi'', translating to &quot;king of [[Sumer]] and Akkad&quot;, which appears to have  meant simply &quot;king of Babylonia&quot;.

The site of Akkad has not been identified, though texts from as late as the [[6th century BC]] mention it, and its ruined buildings.

==Origin of the Name==

The city of Akkad is mentioned once  in the [[Old Testament]] ([[Genesis]] 10:10). 
:''And the beginning of his ([[Nimrod (king)|Nimrod]]'s) kingdom was [[Babylon|Babel]], and [[Erech]], and Accad, and [[Calneh]], in the land of [[Shinar]].'' ([[KJV]])

The [[Greek language|Greek]] ([[LXX]]) spelling is ''Archad''.

The name Agade is probably from the [[Sumerian language]], appearing e.g. in the [[Sumerian king list]], the later Assyro-Babylonian Semitic form ''Akkadû'' (&quot;of or belonging to Akkad&quot;) probably being derived from Agade.

It is possible that the name AGA.DE means &quot;Crown of Fire&quot;{{ref|crown}} in allusion to [[Ishtar]], &quot;the brilliant goddess&quot;, whose cult was observed in very early times in Agade.  This is suggested by the writings of [[Nabonidus]], whose record{{ref|nabonidus}} mentions that Ishtar worship of Agade was later superseded by that of the goddess [[Anunit]], whose shrine was at [[Sippar]].  It is significant in this connection that there were two cities named Sippar, one under the protection of [[Shamash]], the sun-god, and one under Anunit,suggesting proximity of Sippar and Agade. One
theory held (as of [[1911]]) was that Agade was situated opposite Sippar on the left bank of the Euphrates, and was probably the oldest part of the city of Sippar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ajax''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: '''&amp;#913;&amp;#7988;&amp;#945;&amp;#962;'''), a [[Greek mythology|Greek]] hero, son of [[Oileus|Oïleus]] the king of [[Locris]], called the &quot;lesser&quot; or Locrian Ajax, to distinguish him from [[Ajax the great|Ajax]], son of [[Telamon]]. He was the leader of the Locrian contingent during the [[Trojan War]]. He is a significant figure in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and is mentioned in the ''[[Odyssey]]''. 

[[Homer]] gives a favorable description of him as a warrior. In spite of his small stature, he held his own amongst the other heroes before Troy; he was brave, next to [[Achilles]] in swiftness of foot and famous for throwing the spear.  But he was boastful, arrogant and quarrelsome; like the Telamonian Ajax, he was the enemy of [[Odysseus]], and in the end the victim of the vengeance of [[Poseidon]], who wrecked his ship on his homeward voyage ''([[Odyssey]]'', iv. 499).

A later story gives a more definite account of the offense of which he was guilty.  It is said that, after the fall of Troy, he dragged [[Cassandra]] away by force from the statue of the goddess at which she had taken refuge as a suppliant, and raped her ([[Lycophron]], 360, [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] xiii. 422).  For this, his ship was wrecked in a storm on the coast of [[Euboea]], and he himself was struck by lightning and impaled upon a rock. ([[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' I. 40-45).

He was said to have lived after his death in the island of [[Leuke]].  He was worshipped as a national hero by the Opuntian Locrians (on whose coins he appears), who always left a vacant place for him in the ranks of their army when drawn up in battle array.  He was the subject of a lost tragedy by [[Sophocles]].  The rape of Cassandra by Ajax was frequently represented in [[ancient Greece|Greek]] works of art, for instance on the chest of [[Cypselus]] described by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (v. 17) and in extant works.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ajax''', or Aias (Greek: {{polytonic|'''Αἴᾱς'''}}), was a king of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], and a legendary [[hero]] of ancient [[Greece]].

== Ajax the Great ==

To distinguish him from [[Ajax the lesser|Ajax, son of Oileus]] (&quot;Ajax the Lesser&quot;), he was called '''Ajax the Great''' or '''Telamonian Ajax '''. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' he is described as of great stature and colossal frame, the tallest among all the Achaeans, second only to his cousin [[Achilles]] in strength and bravery, and the 'bulwark of the Achaeans'. He was trained by the centaur [[Chiron]] (who had also trained his father, [[Telamon]], and Achilles' father [[Peleus]]), at the same time as Achilles was. Outshone only by his cousin, Ajax was the most valuable king in the battlefield, though not as smart as [[Nestor]], [[Idomeneus]], or, of course, [[Odysseus]]. He commanded his army wielding a great axe and a huge shield made of seven ox-hides with a layer of bronze. He was indeed a great asset to king [[Agamemnon]]'s army. He is not wounded in any of the battles described in the ''Iliad'', and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive personal assistance from any of the gods who take part in the battles. As such, he embodies the virtues of hard work and perseverance.

== Trojan War ==
During the ''[[Iliad]]'', Ajax is notable for his strength and courage, which he displays in abundance, particularly in two fights with [[Hector]]. In Book VII, Ajax is chosen by lot to meet Hector in a duel which lasts most of a whole day. Ajax at first gets the better of the encounter, wounding Hector with his spear and knocking him down with a large stone, but Hector fights on until the [[herald]]s, acting at the direction of [[Zeus]], call a draw: the action ends without a winner and with the two combatants exchanging gifts. 

In Book IX, [[Agamemnon]] and the other Greek chiefs send Ajax, accompanied by Odysseus and [[Phoenix (Iliad)|Phoenix]], to the tent of Achilles, in an attempt to reconcile with the great warrior and induce him to return to the fight. Although Ajax speaks earnestly and is well received, he does not succeed in convincing Achilles.

The second fight between Ajax and Hector occurs when the latter breaks into the [[Achaean]] camp, and fights with the Greeks among the ships. In Book XIV, Ajax throws a giant rock at Hector which almost kills him. In Book XV, Hector is restored to his strength by [[Apollo]] and returns to attack the ships. Ajax, wielding a spear as a weapon and leaping from ship to ship, holds off the [[Trojan]] armies virtually single-handedly. In Book XVI, Hector is able to disarm Ajax (although Ajax is not hurt) and Ajax is forced to retreat under heavy fire. Hector and the Trojans succeed in burning one Greek ship, the culmination of an assault that almost finishes the war. 

All of the foregoing encounters happened when Achilles was not on the battlefield, because he was angry with Agamemnon. Ajax did manage to kill many of the other Trojan lords, including [[Phorkys]].  

When [[Patroclus]] dies, the Trojans try to steal his body and feed him to the dogs, accusing him of being a liar. Ajax is the man who fights to protect the body, and take it back safely to the camp, back to Achilles, the best friend, Patroclus. Ajax, assisted by [[Menelaus]], succeeds in fighting off the Trojans and taking the body back with his chariot; of course, the Trojans had already stolen the armor and left the body naked. Ajax's prayer to Zeus, to remove the fog which has descended on the battle - even if the [[Greeks]] are destined to lose - to allow them to die in the light of day, has become proverbial. 

Like most of the other Greek leaders, Ajax is alive and well as the ''Iliad'' comes to a close. 

Later, when Achilles dies, killed by [[Paris_(mythology)|Paris]] (with help from Apollo), Ajax and Odysseus are the heroes that fight against the Trojans to get the body and bury it next to his dear friend, Patroclus. Ajax, with his great axe, manages to get the Trojans away, while Odysseus pulls the body towards his chariot, and rides away. After the burial, both claim the armor for themselves, as recognition for their efforts. But in the end, after some discussion, Odysseus is given the armor. Ajax is furious about it, and falls to the ground, exhausted. When he wakes up, he becomes mad and goes to a group of sheep, and slaughters them, imagining they are the Trojan leaders, as well as Odysseus and Agamemnon. When he comes to his senses, covered in blood, and realises what he did, he decides that he prefers to kill himself rather than to live in shame. He did it with the same sword Hector had given him when they exchanged presents. (''[[Odyssey]],'' XI. 541). From his blood sprang a red flower, as at the death of [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinthus]], which bore on its leaves the initial letters of his name ''Ai,'' also expressive of lament ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] I. 35.4). His ashes were deposited in a golden urn on the [[Rhoetean]] promontory at the entrance of the [[Hellespont]].

The foregoing account of his death is from the ''Ajax'' of [[Sophocles]]; in [[Pindar]]'s &quot;[[Nemea]]&quot;, 7; and in [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'', xiii. 1. Homer is somewhat vague about the precise manner of Ajax's death but does ascribe it to his loss in the dispute over Achilles's armour: when Odysseus visits [[Hades]], he begs the soul of Ajax to speak to him, but Ajax, still resentful over the old quarrel, refuses and descends silently back into [[Erebus]].

Like Achilles, he is represented (although not by Homer) as living after his death in the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]] at the mouth of the [[Danube]] ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] iii. 19. 11). Ajax, who in the post-Homeric legend is described as the grandson of [[Aeacus]] and the great-grandson of [[Zeus]], was the [[tutelary]] hero of the island of [[Salamis]], where he had a temple and an image, and where a festival called ''Aianteia'' was celebrated in his honour (Pausanias i. 35). At this festival a couch was set up, on which the panoply of the hero was placed, a practice which recalls the Roman [[Lectisternium]]. The identification of Ajax with the family of Aeacus was chiefly a matter which concerned the [[Athenian]]s, after Salamis had come into their possession, on which occasion [[Solon]] is said to have inserted a line in the ''[[Iliad]]'' (II. 557 or 558), for the purpose of supporting the Athenian claim to the island.  Ajax then became an Attic hero; he was worshipped at [[Athens]], where he had a statue in the market-place, and the tribe ''Aiantis'' was named after him.

== Family ==
Ajax is the son of [[Telamon]], who was the son of [[Aeacus]] and grandson of [[Zeus]], and his first wife [[Periboea]]. He is the cousin of Achilles, the most remembered Greek warrior, and elder half-brother of [[Teucer]].  Many illustrious Athenians — including [[Cimon]], [[Miltiades]], [[Alcibiades]] and the historian [[Thucydides]] — traced their descent from Ajax.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AlaricTheGoth.jpg|thumb|right|270px|An [[1894]] [[photogravure]] of Alaric I taken from a painting by Ludwig Thiersch.]]

'''Alaric I''' (Alaric or Alarich, in Latin ''Alaricus'') was likely born about [[370]] on an island named Peuce (the Fir) at the mouth of the [[Danube]], became king of the [[Visigoths]] from [[395]]&amp;ndash;[[410]], and was the first Germanic leader to take the city of [[Rome]].

He was well born, his father kindred to the [[Balti dynasty|Balti]], considered next in worth among Gothic fighters to the [[Amali]]. He was a [[Goths|Goth]] and belonged to the western branch, called the [[Visigoth|Visigoths]], who at the time of his birth dwelt in what is today [[Bulgaria]], having fled beyond the wide estuary marshes of the [[Danube]] to its southern shore so as not to be followed by their foe from the [[steppe]], the [[Huns]].  

==In Roman service==

During the [[4th century]] it had become common practice with the emperors to employ ''[[foederati]]''; Germanic [[irregular military|irregular troops]] under Roman command, but organized by tribal structures. The provincial population, crushed under a load of taxation, could no longer furnish soldiers in the numbers needed for the defence of the empire. Moreover, the emperors—ever fearful that a brilliantly successful general of Roman extraction might be proclaimed [[Augustus]] by his followers—preferred that high military command should be in the hands of one to whom such an accession of dignity was as yet impossible. The largest of these contigents were the Goths which had in [[382]] been allowed to settle within the imperial frontier with a large degree of autonomy.

In [[394]] Alaric served as a leader of foederati under [[Theodosius I]] in the campaign in which he crushed the usurper [[Eugenius]]. As the [[Battle of the Frigidus]], which terminated this campaign, was fought at the passes of the [[Julian Alps]], Alaric probably learned the weakness of [[Italy|Italy's]] natural defences  on its northeastern frontier at the head of the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]].

Theodosius died in 395, leaving the empire to be divided between his two sons [[Arcadius]] and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]], the former taking the eastern and the latter the western portion of the empire. Arcadius showed little interest in ruling, leaving most of the actual power to his [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Rufinus (Byzantine official)|Rufinus]]. Honorius was still a minor; as his guardian, Theodosius had appointed the ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Stilicho]]. Stilicho also claimed to be the guardian of Arcadius, causing much rivalry between the western and eastern courts. 

In the shifting of offices which took place at the beginning of the new reigns, Alaric apparently hoped he would be promoted from a mere commander of federates to generalship of one of the regular armies. This was denied him, however. Among the Visigoths, settled in Lower [[Moesia]], the situation was ripe for rebellion. At Frigidus they had suffered disproportional high losses, according to rumour a convenient way of weakening the Gothic tribes. Their rewards after the campaign had also been lacking. So they raised Alaric on a shield and proclaimed him king; leader and followers both resolving (says [[Jordanes]] the Gothic historian) &quot;rather to seek new kingdoms by their own work, than to slumber in peaceful subjection to the rule of others.&quot;

==In Greece==

Alaric struck first at the eastern empire. He marched to the neighbourhood of [[Constantinople]] but, finding himself unable to undertake the siege of that superbly strong city, retraced his steps westward and then marched southward through [[Thessaly]] and the unguarded pass of [[Thermopylae]] into [[Greece]]. 

The armies of the eastern empire were occupied with [[Huns|Hunnic]] incursions in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Syria]]. Instead Rufinus attempted to negotiate with Alaric in person. The only results was suspicions in Constantinople that Rufinius was in league with the Goths. Stilicho now marched east against Alaric. According to [[Claudian]], Stilicho was in a position to destroy the Goths, when he was ordered by Arcadius to leave [[Illyricum]]. Soon after Rufinus was hacked to death by his own soldiers. Power in Constantinople now passed to the eunuch chamberlain [[Eutropius (Byzantine official)|Eutropius]].

The death of Rufinus and departure of Stilicho gave Alaric free reins. He ravaged Attica but spared Athens, which at once capitulated to the conqueror. Then he penetrated into the [[Peloponnesus]] and captured its most famous cities—[[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], [[Argos]], and [[Sparta]]—selling many of their inhabitants into slavery.

Here, however, his victorious career ended. In [[397]] Stilicho crossed by sea to Greece and succeeded in shutting up the Goths in the mountains of [[Pholoe]] on the borders of [[Elis]] and [[Arcadia]] in the peninsula. From thence Alaric escaped with difficulty, and not without some suspicion of connivance on the part of Stilicho, who supposedly again had received orders to depart. Alaric then crossed the [[Gulf of Corinth]] and marched with the plunder of [[Greece]] northwards to [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]]. Here his rampage continued until the eastern government appointed him ''magister militum per Illyricum'', giving him the Roman command he had desired and authority to resupply his men from the imperial arsenals.

==First invasion of Italy==

It was probably in the year [[400]] that Alaric made his first invasion of Italy, cooperating with another Gothic chieftain named [[Radagaisus]]. Supernatural influences weren't lacking to urge him to this great enterprise. Some lines of the Roman poet inform us that he heard a voice proceeding from a [[Oracle|holy grove]], &quot;Break off all delays, Alaric. This very year thou shalt force the Alpine barrier of Italy; thou shalt penetrate to the city.&quot; But the prophecy wasn't to be fulfilled at this time. After spreading desolation through North [[Italy]] and striking terror into the citizens of Rome, Alaric was met by [[Stilicho]] at [[Pollentia]], today in [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]]. The battle which followed on [[April 6]], [[402]] (coinciding with Easter), was a victory for Rome, though a costly one. But it effectually barred the further progress of the Goths.  

Stilicho's enemies later reproached him for having gained his victory by taking impious advantage of the great Christian festival. Alaric, too, was a Christian, though an [[Arianism|Arian]] rather than a [[Catholic]]. He had trusted to the sanctity of Easter for immunity from attack. 

The wife of Alaric is said to have been taken prisoner after this battle; and there is some reason to suppose that he was hampered in his movements by the presence with his forces of large numbers of women and children, having given to his invasion of [[Italy]] the character of a national migration.  

After another defeat before [[Verona, Italy|Verona]], Alaric left Italy, probably in [[403]]. He hadn't indeed &quot;penetrated to the city&quot; but his invasion of Italy had produced important results. It had caused the imperial residence to be transferred from [[Milan]] to [[Ravenna]], it had necessitated the withdrawal of [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|Legio XX ''Valeria Victrix'']] from Britain, and it had probably facilitated the great invasion of [[Vandals]], [[Suevi|Sueves]], and [[Alans]] into Gaul, which lost Gaul and the provinces of [[Hispania]] to the Empire.

==Second invasion of Italy==

We next hear of Alaric as the friend and ally of his late opponent Stilicho. The estrangement between the eastern and western courts had in [[407]] become so bitter as to threaten civil war, and Stilicho was actually proposing to use the forces of Alaric in order to enforce the claims of Honorius to the [[prefecture]] of Illyricum. The death of Arcadius in May [[408]] caused milder counsels to prevail in the western cabinet, but Alaric, who had actually entered Epirus, demanded in a somewhat threatening manner that if he were thus suddenly bidden to desist from war, he should be paid handsomely for what in modern language would be called the expenses of mobilization. The sum which he named was a large one, 4,000 pounds of gold. Under strong pressure from Stilicho the Roman senate consented to promise its payment. 

But three months later Stilicho himself and the chief ministers of his party were treacherously slain in pursuance of an order extracted from the timid and jealous Honorius. In the disturbances that followed, throughout Italy the wives and children of the foederati were slain. The natural consequence of all this was that these men, to the number of 30,000, flocked to the camp of Alaric, clamouring to be led against their cowardly enemies. He accordingly led them across the Julian Alps and, in September [[408]], stood before the walls of [[Rome]] (now with no capable general like Stilicho as a defender) and began a strict blockade.

No blood was shed this time; hunger was the weapon on which Alaric relied. When the ambassadors of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], in treating for peace, tried to terrify him with their hints of what the despairing citizens might accomplish, he gave with a laugh his celebrated answer: &quot;The thicker the hay, the easier mowed!&quot; After much bargaining, the famine-stricken citizens agreed to pay a ransom of more than two thousand pounds in weight of gold, besides precious garments of [[silk]] and leather and three thousand pounds of [[black pepper|pepper]]. Thus ended Alaric's first siege of Rome. 

At this time, and indeed throughout his career, Alaric's primary goal wasn't to pull down the fabric of the empire but to secure for himself, by negotiation with its rulers, a regular and recognized position within its borders. His demands were certainly large&amp;mdash; the concession of a block of territory 200 miles long by 150 wide between the Danube and the Gulf of Venice (to be held probably on some terms of nominal dependence on the empire) and the title of commander-in-chief of the imperial army&amp;mdash;but, great as these terms were, the emperor would probably have been well advised to grant them. Honorius, however, was one of those timid and feeble folk who are equally unable to make either war or peace, and refused to look beyond the question of his own personal safety, guaranteed as it was by the dikes and marshes of Ravenna. As all attempts to conduct a satisfactory negotiation with this emperor failed before his impenetrable stupidity, Alaric, after instituting a second siege and blockade of Rome in [[409]], came to terms with the senate. With their consent he set up a rival emperor and invested the prefect of the city, a Greek named [[Priscus Attalus]], with the diadem and the purple robe. 

Attalus, however, proved quite unfit for his high position; he rejected the advice of Alaric and lost in consequence the [[Africa (province)|province of Africa]], the granary of Rome, which was defended by the partisans of Honorius. The weapon of famine, formerly in the hand of Alaric, was thus turned against him, and loud in consequence were the murmurs of the Roman populace. Honorius was also greatly strengthened by the arrival of six legions sent to his assistance from Constantinople by his nephew [[Theodosius II]]. 

Alaric therefore cashiered his puppet emperor, after the latter's eleven months of ineffectual rule, and once more tried to reopen negotiations with Honorius. These negotiations would probably have succeeded but for the malign influence of another Goth, [[Sarus]], the hereditary enemy of Alaric and his house. When Alaric found himself once more outwitted by the machinations of such a foe, he marched southward and began in deadly earnest his third, his ever-memorable siege of Rome. No defence apparently was possible; there are hints, not well substantiated, of treachery; there is greater probability of surprise. However this may be&amp;mdash;for our information at this point of the story is meagre&amp;mdash;on [[August 24]], [[410]], Alaric and his Visigoths burst in by the Salarian gate on the northeast of the city. She who had been mistress of the world now lay at the feet of foreign enemies.

But in their plundering of the city, the Visigoths weren't absolutely ruthless. The contemporary ecclesiastics recorded with wonder many instances of their clemency: Christian churches saved from ravage; protection granted to vast multitudes both of pagans and Christians who took refuge therein; vessels of gold and silver which were found in a private dwelling, spared because they &quot;belonged to St. Peter&quot;; at least one case in which a beautiful Roman matron appealed, not in vain, to the better feelings of the Gothic soldier who attempted her dishonor. But even these exceptional instances show that Rome wasn't entirely spared those scenes of horror which usually accompany the storming of a besieged city. Nonetheless, the written sources do not tell of any damage wrought by fire, save in the case of [[Sallust]]'s palace, which was situated close to the gate by which the Goths had made their entrance; nor is there any reason to attribute any extensive destruction of the buildings of the city to Alaric and his followers. The [[Basilica Aemilia]] in the [[Roman Forum]] did burn down, which perhaps can be attributed to Alaric, based on evidence from archaeologists: coins dating from 410 found melted in the floor.  

[[Image:Death of Alaric.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The burial of Alaric in the bed of the [[Busento River]]. 1895 lithograph]]

His work being done, his fated task, and Alaric having penetrated to the city, nothing remained for him but to die. He marched southwards into [[Calabria]]. He desired to invade Africa, which on account of its corn crops was now the key of the position, but his ships were dashed to pieces by a storm in which many of his soldiers perished. He died in [[Cosenza]] soon after, probably of fever, at the early age of thirty-four, and his body was buried under the riverbed of the [[Busento]]. The stream was temporarily turned aside from its course while the grave was dug wherein the Gothic chief and some of his most precious spoils were interred; when the work was finished the river was turned back into its usual channel and the captives by whose hands the labor had been accomplished were put to death that none might learn their secret. 

Alaric was succeeded in the command of the Gothic army by his brother-in-law, [[Ataulf]].

Our chief authorities for the career of Alaric are the historian [[Orosius]] and the poet [[Claudian]], both strictly contemporary; [[Zosimus]], a somewhat prejudiced pagan historian, who lived probably about half a century after the death of Alaric; and [[Jordanes]], a Goth who wrote the history of his nation in the year [[551]], basing his work on the earlier history of [[Cassiodorus]] (now lost), which was written about [[520]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alaric II''', also known as Alarik, Alarich, and ''Alarico'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or ''Alaricus'' in [[Latin]] (d. [[507]]) succeeded his father [[Euric]] in [[485]] as king of the [[Visigoths]]. His dominions included not only the whole of [[Hispania]] except its north-western corner but also [[Aquitaine]] and the greater part of an as-yet undivided [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. 

In religion Alaric was an [[Arianism|Arian]], like all the early Visigothic nobles, but he greatly mitigated the persecuting policy of his father Euric toward the [[Catholicism|Catholics]] and authorized them to hold in [[506]] the council of [[Agde]]. He was on uneasy terms with the Catholic bishops of Arles as epitomized in the career of the Frankish [[Caesarius of Arles|Caesarius, bishop of Arles]], born at [[Châlons]] and appointed bishop in 503. Caesarius was suspected of conspiring with the [[Burgundians]] to turn over the Arelate to Burgundy, whose king had married the sister of [[Clovis I|Clovis]], so Alaric exiled him for a year safely at Bordeaux in Aquitaine before allowing him to return unharmed when the crisis had passed ([http://www.ccel.org/w/wace/biodict/htm/iii.iii.iv.htm Wace, ''Dictionary'']). 

He displayed similar wisdom and liberality in political affairs by appointing a commission to prepare an abstract of the Roman laws and imperial decrees, which should form the authoritative code for his Roman subjects. This is generally known as the ''Breviarium Alaricianum'' or [[Breviary of Alaric]]. 

Alaric was of a peaceful disposition and endeavoured strictly to maintain the treaty which his father had concluded with the [[Franks]], whose king [[Clovis I]], however, desiring to obtain the Gothic province in Gaul, found a pretext for war in the Arianism of Alaric. The intervention of [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]], king of the [[Ostrogoths]] and father-in-law of Alaric, proved unavailing. The two armies met in [[507]] at the [[Battle of Vouillé]], near Poitiers, where the Goths were defeated and their king, who took to flight, was overtaken and slain, it is said, by Clovis himself. 

His legitimate son [[Amalaric]] was still a child, so he was succeeded by his 
illegitimate son, [[Gesalec]].

{{Redirect3|Albertus|is also the name of a [[Albertus (typeface)|typeface]]}}

'''Albertus Magnus''' ([[1193]]? &amp;ndash; [[November 15]], [[1280]]), also known as '''Saint Albert the Great''' and '''Albert of Cologne''', was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar who became famous for his universal knowledge and advocacy for the peaceful coexistence of science and religion. He is considered to be the greatest German philosopher and theologian of the [[Middle Age]]s.  He was the first medieval scholar to apply [[Aristotle]]'s philosophy to Christian thought at the time. [[Catholicism]] honors him as a [[Doctor of the Church]], one of only 33 men and women with that honor.

==Biography==
He was born of the noble family of Bollstadt in [[Lauingen]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]] on the [[Danube]], sometime between 1193 and [[1206]].  The term &quot;magnus&quot; is not descriptive; it is the [[Latin]] equivalent of his family name, de Groot.

Albertus was educated principally at [[Padua]], where he received instruction in [[Aristotle]]'s writings. After an alleged encounter with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], he entered holy orders.   In [[1223]] (or [[1221]]) he became a member of the [[Dominican Order]], and studied [[theology]] under its rules at [[Bologna]] and elsewhere.  Selected to fill the position of lecturer at [[Cologne]], where the order had a house, he taught for several years there, at [[Regensburg]], [[Freiburg]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Hildesheim]].  In [[1245]] he went to [[Paris]], received his doctorate and taught for some time, in accordance with the regulations, with great success.  

In [[1254]] he was made provincial of the Dominican Order, and fulfilled the arduous duties of the office with great care and efficiency.  During the time he held this office he publicly defended the Dominicans against the attacks by the secular and regular faculty of the [[University of Paris]], commented on [[John the Evangelist|St John]], and answered the errors of the [[Arab philosophy|Arabian philosopher]], [[Averroes]]. 

In [[1260]] [[Pope Alexander IV]] made him [[bishop]] of [[Regensburg]], which office he resigned after three years.  The remainder of his life he spent partly in preaching throughout Bavaria and the adjoining districts, partly in retirement in the various houses of his order.  In [[1270]] he preached the [[eighth Crusade]] in [[Austria]].  Among the last of his labours was the defence of the orthodoxy of his former pupil, [[Thomas Aquinas]], whose death in [[1274]] grieved Albertus.  After suffering collapse of health in [[1278]], he died on [[November 15]], [[1280]], in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]].  His tomb is in the [[crypt]] of the Dominican church of [[St. Andreas]] in Cologne.

Albertus is frequently mentioned by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], who made his doctrine of [[free will]] the basis of his ethical system.  In his [[Divine Comedy]], Dante places Albertus with his pupil Thomas Aquinas among the great lovers of wisdom (''Spiriti Sapienti'') in the Heaven of the Sun.

Albertus was beatified in [[1622]]. He was canonized and also officially named a Doctor of the Church in [[1931]] by [[Pope Pius XI]]. His feast day is celebrated on November 15th.

==Writings==
Albertus's writings collected in [[1899]] went to 38 volumes, displaying his prolific habits and literally encyclopedic knowledge of topics including, but not limited to, logic, theology, botany, geography, astronomy, mineralogy, chemistry, zoölogy, physiology, and [[phrenology]], all of it the result of logic and observation.  He was the most widely read author of his time.  The whole of [[Aristotle]]'s works, presented in the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, were by him digested, interpreted and systematized in accordance with church doctrine.  He came to be so associated with Aristotle that he was referred to as &quot;Aristotle's ape&quot;.  

Albert's activity, however, was more philosophical than theological (see [[Scholasticism]]). The philosophical works, occupying the first six and the last of the twenty-one volumes, are generally divided according to the Aristotelian scheme of the sciences, and consist of interpretations and condensations of Aristotle's relative works, with supplementary discussions depending on the questions then agitated, and occasionally divergences from the opinions of the master. 

His principal theological works are a commentary in three volumes on the Books of the Sentences of [[Peter Lombard]] (''Magister Sententiarum''), and the ''Summa Theologiae'' in two volumes.  This last is in substance a repetition of the first in a more didactic form.

==Albertus as scientist==
Albertus's knowledge of physical science was considerable and for the age accurate.  His industry in every department was great, and though we find in his system many of those gaps which are characteristic of scholastic philosophy, yet the protracted study of Aristotle gave him a great power of systematic thought and exposition, and the results of that study, as left to us, by no means warrant the contemptuous title sometimes given him of the &quot;Ape of Aristotle.&quot; They rather lead us to appreciate the motives which caused his contemporaries to bestow on him the honourable surnames &quot;The Great&quot; and ''Doctor Universalis.'' It must, however, be admitted that much of his knowledge was ill digested; it even appears that he regarded [[Plato]] and [[Speusippus]] as [[Stoics]].  

Albertus was both a student and a teacher of [[alchemy]] and [[chemistry]]. He isolated [[arsenic]] in [[1250]]. He was alleged to be a magician, since he was repeatedly charged by some of his unfriendly contemporaries with communing with the devil, practicing the craft of magic, and with the making of a demonic automata able to speak. He was also one of the alchemists reputed to have succeeded in discovering the [[Philosopher's Stone]].

[[Image:Albertus Magnus-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|Albertus Magnus monument in Cologne]]

==Music==
In music history, Albertus is known for his enlightening commentary on musical practice of the time.  Most of his musical observations are given in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Poetics''.  Among other things, he rejects the idea of &quot;[[music of the spheres]]&quot; as ridiculous:  movement of astronomical bodies, he supposes, is incapable of generating sound.  He also wrote extensively on proportions in music, and on the three different subjective levels on which [[plainchant]] could work on the human soul:  purging of the impure; illumination leading to contemplation; and nourishing perfection through contemplation.  Of particular interest to [[20th century]] music theorists is the attention he paid to silence as an integral part of music.

==Trivia==
*Magnus is recorded as having made an [[android]], a mechanical [[automaton]] in the figure of a man. {{ref label|1728|1|^}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the archaic name for Great Britain. For other meanings, see [[Albion (disambiguation)]]''
[[Image:white_cliffs_of_dover_09_2004.jpg|320px|thumb|The white cliffs of Dover]]'''Albion''' (in [[Ptolemy]] ''Alouion''), is the most ancient name of [[Great Britain]], though often used to refer specifically to [[England]].  Occasionally it instead refers to only [[Scotland]], whose name in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] is ''[[Alba]]'' (and similarly, in [[Irish language|Irish]], and ''Yr Alban'' in Welsh{{ref|welsh}}).  [[Pliny the Elder]], in his ''Natural History'' (iv.xvi.102) applies it unequivocally to Great Britain, &quot;It was itself named Albion, while all the islands about which we shall soon briefly speak were called the Britanniae.&quot; The name ''Albion'' was taken by medieval writers from  Pliny and [[Ptolemy]].

The name is perhaps of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin or older, from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root that denotes both &quot;white&quot; and &quot;mountain&quot;, but the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] took it as connected with ''albus'' (white), in reference to the chalk &quot;[[White Cliffs of Dover]]&quot;, and Alfred Holder's ''Alt-Keltischer Sprachschatz,'' (1896) unhesitatingly translates it ''Weissland'' (&quot;whiteland&quot;). The early writer ([[6th century BC]]) whose [[periplus]] was translated by [[Avienus]] at the end of the 4th century AD (see ''[[Massaliote Periplus]]'')  does not use the name ''Britannia''; he speaks of ''nesos 'Iernon kai 'Albionon'' (island of the Ierni and the Albiones).  So [[Pytheas of Massilia]] ([[4th century BC]]) speaks of ''Albion and 'Ierne''. From the fact that there was a tribe called the ''Albiones'' on the north coast of [[Spain]] in [[Asturias]], some scholars have placed Albion in that neighbourhood (see G. F. Unger, ''Rhein. Mus.'' xxxviii., 1883, pp. 156-196).  

The pejorative [[sobriquet]] ''[[perfidious Albion]]'' takes its meaning from this old name for Britain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alboin''' or '''Alboïn''' (d. [[572]] or [[573]]), king of the [[Lombards]], and conqueror of [[Italy]], succeeded his father [[Audoin]] about [[565]]. The Lombards were at that time dwelling in [[Noricum]] and [[Pannonia]] (the plain of eastern Austria south and east of the Danube, modern-day Slovenia and Istria).  In alliance with the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], an Asiatic people who had invaded central Europe, Alboin defeated the Lombards' hereditary enemies, the [[Gepids]], a powerful nation on his eastern frontier, slew their new king 
[[Cunimund]], whose skull he fashioned into a drinking-cup, and whose daughter [[Rosamund]] he carried off and made his wife. 

Three years later, in April, [[568]], on the alleged invitation of [[Narses]], who was irritated by the treatment he had received from the emperor [[Justin II]], Alboin invaded [[Italy]], with the women and children of the tribe and all their possessions, with 20,000 Saxon allies and the subject tribe of the Gepids and a mixed host of other barbarians, probably marching over the pass of the [[Predil]] and crossing the great plain at the head of the Adriatic into Italy. The [[Gothic War]], which had ended in the downfall of the Goths, had exhausted Italy, which was wracked with famine and plague, and the Eastern Emperor's government at Constantinople was powerless to retain the Italian province which [[Belisarius]] and [[Narses]] had recently recovered for it. Alboin's horde overran [[Venice|Venetia]] and the wide district which we now call [[Lombardy]], took Milan in 569, meeting with but feeble resistance till he came to the city of [[Ticinum]] ([[Pavia]]), which for three years ([[569]]-[[572]]) kept the Lombards at bay and then became the new capital. Where the Lombards did meet with resistance, retribution was savage beyond anything Italy had experienced before. The bishops, who were virtually the leaders of the late antique Roman cities, fled, like the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|bishop of Milan]], or compounded with the barbarians for gentler treatment of their people. 

While the siege of Pavia was in progress Alboin was also engaged in other parts of Italy, and at Pavia's capitulation he was probably master of [[Lombardy]], [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] and [[Tuscany]], as well as of the regions which afterwards went by the name of the duchies of [[Spoleto]] and [[Benevento]].     

In [[572]], according to [[Paul the Deacon]] (Paulus Diaconus), the [[8th century]] Lombard chronicler, Alboin fell a victim to the revenge of his wife Rosamund, the daughter of the king of the Gepids, whose skull Alboin had turned into a drinking cup (worn at his belt) and out of which he forced Rosamund to drink. Rosamund immediately went to [[Helemechis]] (or ''Helmgis''), the king's [[squire]] (''scilpor'') or armour-bearer and foster brother, who advised her to seek out [[Peredeo]], a very strong man.  Peredeo refused to involve himself in such a crime.  So the queen went to the bed of the dressing-maid with whom Peredeo was having an affiar and, unbeknownst to Peredeo, slept with him. When the deed was done, the queen revealed her identity to Peredeo and said 

:''&quot;...surely now you have perpetrated such a deed, Peredeo, that either you must kill Alboin or he will slay you with his sword.&quot;''

Letting Paul the Deacon continue:

:''Then he learned the evil thing he had done, and he who had been unwilling of his own accord, assented, when forced in such a way, to the murder of the king. Then Rosemund, while Alboin had given himself up to a noon-day sleep, ordered that there should be a great silence in the palace, and taking away all other arms, she bound his sword tightly to the head of the bed so it could not be taken away or unsheathed, and according to the advice of Peredeo, she, more cruel than any beast, let in Helmechis the murderer. Alboin suddenly aroused from sleep perceived the evil which threatened and reached his hand quickly for his sword, which, being tightly tied, he could not draw, yet he seized a foot-stool and defended himself with it for some time. But unfortunately alas! this most warlike and very brave man being helpless against his enemy, was slain as if he were one of no account, and he who was most famous in war through the overthrow of so many enemies, perished by the scheme of one little woman.''[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/langobard/index.php]

So Peredeo and the queen fled to the protection of the Byzantine representative at Ravenna.

In these few years the Lombards had established themselves in the north of Italy (henceforth [[Lombardy]]). But they had little practice in governing large provinces. Lombard warlords (which Latin chroniclers called 'dukes') were established in all the strongholds and passes, and this arrangement became increasingly characteristic of the Lombard settlement. Their power extended tenuously across the Apennines into Liguria and Tuscany, and southwards to the outlying Lombard dukedoms of [[Spoleto]] and [[Benevento]]. The invaders failed to secure any maritime ports or any territory that was conveniently commanded from the sea, such as Byzantine [[Ravenna]].  Local inhabitants fled into the marshes and lagoons, where [[Venice]] had its beginnings.

After his death and the short reign of his successor [[Cleph]] the Lombards remained for more than ten years without a king, ruled by the various dukes. 

The authorities for the history of Alboin are first of all [[Paul the Deacon]], the Byzantine [[Procopius]],  and [[Agnellus]] (in his history of the church of [[Ravenna]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:afonso_albuquerque3.jpg|thumb|right|Afonso de Albuquerque|125px]]'''Afonso de Albuquerque''', '''Afonso d'Albuquerque''' or '''Alfonso de Albuquerque''' ([[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|ɐ.'fõ.su dɨ aɫ.βu.'kɛɾ.kɨ}})  ([[1453]] - [[December 16]], [[1515]]) was a noted [[Portugal|Portuguese]] naval general whose activities helped establish the Portuguese colonial empire in India.

==Early life==
Born in Alhandra in the year of 1453, near  [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], he was for some time known as ''The Great'', and as ''The Portuguese Mars''.  Through his father, Gonçalo, who held an important position at court, he was connected by illegitimate descent with the royal family of Portugal.  He was educated at the court of [[Afonso V of Portugal]], and after the death of that monarch seems to have served for some time in [[Africa]].  On his return he was appointed ''estribeiro-mor'' (chief [[equerry]]) to [[John II of Portugal|John II]].

==Expeditions to the East==

===First Expedition, 1503-1504===
In [[1503]] he set out on his first expedition to the East, which was to be the scene of his future triumphs.  In company with his kinsman Francisco he sailed round the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to [[India]], and succeeded in establishing the king of Cochin securely on his throne, obtaining in return for this service permission to build a Portuguese fort at Cochin, and thus laying the foundation of his country's empire in the East.  

===Operations in the Persian Gulf and Malabar, 1504-1508===
Albuquerque returned home in [[July]] [[1504]], and was well received by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], who entrusted him with the command of a squadron of five vessels in the fleet of sixteen which sailed for [[India]] in [[1506]] under [[Tristão da Cunha]].  After a series of successful attacks on the [[Arab]] cities on the east coast of Africa, Albuquerque separated from Da Cunha, and sailed with his squadron against the island of [[Ormuz]], in the [[Persian Gulf]], which was then one of the chief centres of commerce in the East.  He arrived on [[September 25]], [[1507]], and soon obtained possession of the island, though he was unable long to maintain his position.  

With his squadron increased by three vessels, he reached the [[Malabarian Coast|Malabar coast]] at the close of the year [[1508]], and immediately made known the commission he had received from the king empowering him to supersede the governor [[Francisco de Almeida]].  The latter, however, refused to recognize Albuquerque's credentials and cast him into prison, from which he was only released, after three months' confinement, on the arrival of the grand-marshal of Portugal with a large fleet, in November 1509.  Almeida having returned home, Albuquerque speedily showed the energy and determination of his character.

===Operations in Goa and Malacca, 1510-1511===
An unsuccessful attack upon Calicut (modern [[Kozhikode]]) in January [[1510]], in which the commander-in-chief received a severe wound, was immediately followed by the investment and capture of [[Old Goa|Goa]]. Albuquerque, finding himself unable to hold the town on his first occupation, abandoned it in [[August]], to return with the reinforcements in [[November]], when he obtained undisputed possession.  He next directed his forces against the [[Sultanate of Malacca]], which he subdued [[August 24]]th [[1511]] after a severe struggle.  He remained in the town nearly a year in order to strengthen the position of the portuguese crown.

===Various operations, 1512-1515===
In [[1512]] he sailed for the coast of Malabar.  On the voyage a violent storm arose, Albuquerque's vessel, the ''Flor do Mar'', which carried the treasure he had amassed in his conquests, was wrecked, and he himself barely escaped with his life.  In [[September]] of the same year he arrived at Goa, where he quickly suppressed a serious revolt headed by Idalcan, and took such measures for the security and peace of the town that it became the most flourishing of the Portuguese settlements in India.  Albuquerque had been for some time under orders from the home government to undertake an expedition to the [[Red Sea]], in order to secure that channel of communication exclusively to Portugal.  He accordingly laid siege to [[Aden]] in [[1513]], but was repulsed; and a voyage into the Red Sea, the first ever made by a European fleet, led to no substantial results.  In order to destroy the power of [[Egypt]], he is said to have entertained the idea of diverting the course of the [[Nile River]] and so rendering the whole country barren. His last warlike undertaking was a second attack upon Ormuz in [[1515]].  The island yielded to him without resistance, and it remained in the possession of the Portuguese until [[1622]].

==Political downfall and last years==
Albuquerque's career had a painful and ignominious close.  He had several enemies at the Portuguese court who lost no opportunity of stirring up the jealousy of King Manuel against him, and his own injudicious and arbitrary conduct on several occasions served their end only too well.  On his return from Ormuz, at the entrance of the harbour of Goa, he met a vessel from Europe bearing dispatches announcing that he was superseded by his personal enemy [[Lopo Soares de Albergaria]].  The blow was too much for him and he died at sea on December 16, 1515.

Before his death he wrote a letter to the king in dignified and affecting terms, vindicating his conduct and claiming for his son the honours and rewards that were justly due to himself.  His body was buried at Goa in the Church of our Lady.  The king of Portugal was convinced too late of his fidelity, and endeavoured to atone for the ingratitude with which he had treated him by heaping honours upon his natural son Brás.  The latter published a selection from his father's papers under the title ''Commentarios do Grande Affonso d'Alboquerque''. 

The Indians long remembered his benign rule, and used to visit his tomb to pray him to deliver them from the oppression of his successors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alcaeus '''('''Alkaios''')''' of Mitylene''' (ca. [[620s BC|620 BC]]-[[6th century BC]]), [[ancient Greece|Greek]] [[lyric]] poet, was an older contemporary and an alleged lover of [[Sappho]], with whom he exchanged poems. He was of the aristocratic governing class of [[Mytilene]], the main city of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], where his life was entangled with its political disputes and internal feuds. He sided with his class against the upstart &quot;[[tyrant]]s&quot; who set themselves up in Mytilene as the voice of the people. He was in consequence obliged to spend a considerable time in exile. He is said to have become reconciled to [[Pittacus]], the ruler set up by the populist party, and to have returned eventually to Lesbos. The date of his death is unknown.

When his poems were edited in [[Hellenistic]] [[Alexandria]], they were reported to have filled ten scrolls.  However, the poetry of Alcaeus has survived only in quotations: &quot;Fighting men are the city's fortress&quot; and the like, so judging him, rather than his high reputation in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], is like judging [[Ben Jonson]] through ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]''. The subjects of his poems, which were composed in the [[Aeolic Greek]] dialect, were of various kinds: hymns to the gods; martial or political comment, sometimes quite personal; and lastly love-songs and drinking-songs, the kind of poetry that would be read aloud at a [[symposium]]. Alexandrian scholars agreed that Alcaeus was the second greatest lyric poet among the [[Nine lyric poets|canonic nine]]. The considerable number of fragments extant (''see link''), and the imitations of Alcaeus in Latin by [[Horace]], who regarded Alcaeus as his great model, help us to form a fair idea of the character of his poems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alcamenes''' was a Greek [[Sculpture|sculptor]] of [[Lemnos]] and [[Athens]].

He was a younger contemporary of [[Pheidias]] and noted for the delicacy and finish of his works, among which a [[Hephaestus]] and an [[Aphrodite]] &quot;of the Gardens&quot; were conspicuous.

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] says (v. 10. 8) that he was the author of one of the pediments of the temple of [[Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], but this seems a chronological and stylistic impossibility. At [[Pergamum]] there was discovered in 1903 a copy of the head of the Hermes &quot;Propylaeus&quot; of Alcamenes (''Athenische Mittheilungen'', 1904, p. 180).  As, however, the deity is represented in an archaistic and conventional character, this copy cannot be relied on as giving us much information as to the usual style of Alcamenes, who was almost certainly a progressive and original artist.

It is safer to judge him by the sculptural decoration of the [[Parthenon]], in which he must almost certainly have taken a share under the direction of Pheidias.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:'''''[[82 Alkmene]]''' is an [[asteroid]].''

In [[Greek mythology]]  '''Alcmene''', or '''Alkmênê''' (&quot;might of the moon&quot;) , the daughter of [[Electryon]], king of [[Mycenae]] and a son of [[Perseus]], was the wife of [[Amphitryon]] in his exile, though he had accidentally killed her father. Some mythographers identified her mother as [[Eurydice]] (Graves, 110.c).

With Amphitryon she fled to [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], where [[Creon]] purified her husband of his blood-guilt. However, Alcmene's eight brothers had been killed in a cattle raid, and she would not lie with Amphitryon until they had been avenged.

Thus at Thebes she was the mother of [[Heracles]] by [[Zeus]], who assumed the likeness of her husband during his absence to lie with her and stayed [[Helios]], to make one night into three; and she was the mother of [[Iphicles]] by Amphitryon, when he returned, giving birth to Heracles' twin, younger by a day. In this way Alcmene is one among several mothers of mythic twins of whom the sire of one is mortal, of the other a god, the most famous of them being the [[Dioscuri]], two from the double set of such twins of [[Leda]]. Theseus combined in his person a double fatherhood, a human father and a divine: see [[Theseus]]. In this case Alcmene's son Iphicles was mortal, while Heracles became immortal.

While Alcmene was pregnant with [[Heracles]] (&quot;glory of Hera&quot;), [[Hera]] herself tried to prevent her from giving birth to the [[hero]] who would help establish the new Olympian order.  She was foiled by [[Galanthis]], Alcmene's servant, who told Hera that she had already delivered the baby.  Hera turned her into a [[weasel]].

Through Heracles, Alcmene was regarded as the ancestress of the [[Heracleidae]], and venerated at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Athens]].

After the death of Amphitryon, Alcmene married the Cretan [[Rhadamanthus]], who was exiled in [[Boeotia]]. Their &quot;tombs&quot; were shown to travellers in classical times at Haliartus (Graves, 88.i); such &quot;tombs&quot; were generally sites for propitiatory ancestor [[Cult (religion)|cults]] (compare Burkert 1985).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alcidamas''', of Elaea, in [[Aeolis]], [[ancient Greece|Greek]] [[sophist]] and [[rhetoric]]ian, flourished in the [[4th century BC]].

He was the pupil and successor of [[Gorgias]] and taught at [[Athens]] at the same time as [[Isocrates]], whose rival and opponent he was. We possess two declamations under his name: ''Peri Sofiston'', directed against Isocrates and setting forth the superiority of extempore over written speeches (a more recently discovered fragment of another speech against Isocrates is probably of later date); ''Odusseus'', in which [[Odysseus]] accuses [[Palamedes]] of treachery during the siege of [[Troy]] (this is generally considered spurious).

According to Alcidamas, the highest aim of the orator was the power of speaking ''extempore'' on every conceivable subject. [[Aristotle]] (''Rhet.'' iii. 3) criticizes his writings as characterized by pomposity of style and an extravagant use of poetical epithets and compounds and far-fetched metaphors.

Of other works only fragments and the titles have survived: ''Messeniakos'', advocating the freedom of the Messenians and containing the sentiment that &quot;all are by nature free&quot;; a ''Eulogy of Death'', in consideration of the wide extent of human sufferings; a ''Techne'' or instruction-book in the art 
of rhetoric; and a ''Fusikos lolos''. Lastly, his ''Mouseion'' (a word of doubtful meaning) contained the narrative of the contest between [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]], two fragments of which are found in the ''Agon Omerou kai Esiodou'', the work of a grammarian in the time of [[Hadrian]].  A [[3rd century]] [[papyrus]] ([[William Matthew Flinders Petrie|Flinders Petrie]], ''Papyri'', ed.  [[John Pentland Mahaffy|Mahaffy]], 1891, pl. xxv.) probably contains the actual remains of a description by Alcidamas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aldine Press''' was the [[printing]] office started by [[Aldus Manutius]] in [[1494]] in [[Venice]], from which were issued the celebrated Aldine editions of the classics of that time. The Aldine Press is famous in the history of [[typography]], among other things, for the introduction of italics. The press was continued after Aldus death in [[1515]] by his wife and her father until his son Paolo ([[1512]]-[[1574]]) took over. His grandson Aldo then ran the firm until his death in [[1597]].

==Initial Innovations==
The press was started by Aldus based on his love of classics, and at first printed new copies of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek and Latin classics. He also printed dictionaries and grammars to help people interpret the books. Since most bibliophiles and book collectors come from academic and classical backgrounds, his first editions are collectors items. His contributions are also respected in the development of a smaller type than others in use. His contemporaries called it ''Aldine Type''; today we call it ''italics''.

The goal of the press was to create plentiful, affordable books so that everyone could have access to literature. When the press expanded to current titles, they wrote some books themselves and employed other writers, including [[Erasmus]]. As this expansion into current languages (mainly Italian and French) and current topics continued, the press took on another role and made perhaps even more important contributions. Their logo of the anchor and dolphin is represented today in the symbols and names used by some modern publishers.

==The Literacy Revolution==
[[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]] gets credit for inventing the printing press with some justification, but [[Aldus Manutius|Aldus]] and his sons created the revolution. Gutenberg produced some beautiful volumes. They were priced so that a man of moderate wealth could buy a book. They were still large, heavy voumes and expensive. A church that had a Bible would typically chain it to a reading stand. Aldus created smaller books (called ''octavo'') that could fit in a saddlebag and that the average merchant or craftsman could afford.

With books readily available, it was now worthwhile to learn to read. In dealing with current topics, the second or third edition is the better book. When Paolo or Aldo hired a great shipbuilder to write a book on shipbuilding, he described all the best techniques he was aware of. Other builders bought the book and then wrote to protest that their technique for a particular technology was better. Many of these improvements were then incorporated in the later editions. Before the Aldine Press, a new innovation might take a hundred years to get from Italy to the Netherlands. Afterward, information started to move in all directions, and communication times were reduced to five or six years. This is an important step in the modernization of Europe, and can even be viewed as a precursor of the [[Internet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{otheruses4|Aldred the English ecclesiastic|the Anglo-Saxon leader|Hwicce}}

'''Aldred''', or '''Ealdred''' (d. [[11 September]],[[1069]]), [[England|English]] ecclesiastic, became [[abbot]] of [[Tavistock]] about [[1027]], in [[1044]] was made [[bishop of Worcester]], and in [[1060]], [[archbishop of York]].

He had considerable influence over King [[Edward the Confessor]], and as his interests were secular rather than religious he took a prominent part in affairs of state, and in [[1046]] led 
an unsuccessful expedition against the [[Wales|Welsh]]. In [[1050]] he was largely instrumental in restoring [[Sweyn]], the son of [[Earl Godwin]], to his earldom, and about the same time went to [[Rome]] 
&quot;on the king's errand.&quot;

In [[1054]] he was sent to the emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] to obtain that monarch's influence in securing the return to England of Edward, son of Edmund Ironside, who was in [[Hungary]] with King [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew I]]. In this mission he was successful and obtained some insight into the working of the German church during a stay of a year with Hermann II, archbishop of [[Cologne]].

After his return to [[England]] he took charge of the sees of [[Hereford]] and [[Ramsbury]], although not appointed to these bishoprics; and in [[1058]] made a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]], being the first English bishop to take this journey.

Having previously given up Hereford and Ramsbury, Aldred was elected archbishop of [[York]] in [[1060]], and in [[1061]] he proceeded to [[Rome]] to receive the [[pallium]].  On his arrival there, however, various charges were brought against him by a [[synod]], and [[Pope Nicholas II]] not only refused his request but degraded him from the episcopate. The sentence was, however, subsequently reversed, and Aldred received the pallium and was restored to his former station.

It is stated by [[Florence of Worcester]] that Aldred crowned King [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II]] in [[1066]], although the [[Normans|Norman]] authorities mention [[Stigand]] as the officiating prelate. After the [[battle of Hastings]], Aldred joined the party who sought to bestow the throne upon [[Edgar Atheling|Edgar the Ætheling]], but when these efforts appeared hopeless he was among those who submitted to [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] at [[Berkhamstead]].

Selected to crown the new king he performed the ceremony on Christmas Day [[1066]], and in [[1068]] performed the same office at the coronation of Matilda, the Conqueror's wife. But though often at court, he seems to have been no sympathiser with Norman oppression, and is even said to have 
bearded the king himself.  He died at York on the [[September 11]] [[1069]] and was buried in his own cathedral.

Aldred did much for the restoration of discipline in the monasteries and churches under his authority, and was liberal in his gifts for ecclesiastical purposes. He built the monastic 
church of St Peter at [[Gloucester]], and rebuilt a large part of that of St John at Beverley.  At his instigation, Folcard, a monk of Canterbury, wrote the Life of St John of Beverley.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexander I of Epirus''' (c. [[370 BC]] - c. [[331 BC]]), also known as '''Alexander Molossus''' was a king of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] ([[350 BC]]-[[331 BC]]) of the [[Aeacid dynasty]].

He was the son of [[Neoptolemus]] and brother of [[Olympias]], the mother of [[Alexander the Great]]. He came at an early age to the court of [[Philip II of Macedonia]], and after the Grecian fashion became the object of his attachment. Philip in requital made him king of Epirus, after dethroning his cousin [[Arymbas]]. When Olympias was repudiated by her husband, [[337 BC]], she went to her brother, and endeavoured to induce him to make war on Philip.

Philip, however, declined the contest, and formed a second alliance with him by giving him his daughter [[Cleopatra of Macedonia|Cleopatra]] in marriage ([[336 BC]]). At the wedding Philip was assassinated by [[Pausanias (assassin)|Pausanias]]. In [[334 BC]], Alexander, at the request of colony of [[Taranto|Taras]] ([[Magna Graecia]]) and the people the [[Tarentines]], crossed over into [[Italy]], to aid them against the [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic populations]], [[Lucanians]] and [[Bruttii]]. After a victory over the Samnites and Lucanians near [[Paestum]], [[332 BC]], he made a treaty with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. Success still followed his arms. He took [[Heraclea]]  from the Lucanians, and [[Terina]] and [[Sipontum]] from the Bruttii. Through the treachery of some Lucanian exiles, he was compelled to engage under unfavourable circumstances near [[Pandosia]], on the banks of the Acheron, and was killed by the hand of one of the exiles, as he was crossing the river. He left a son, Neoptolemus, and a daughter, Cadmea.

The date ΓΞΡ is year 163 of the [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucid era]], corresponding to [[150 BC|150]]&amp;ndash;[[149 BC]].]]

'''Alexander Balas''' (i.e. &quot;lord&quot;), ruler of the [[Greece|Greek]] [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid kingdom]] [[150 BC|150]]-[[146 BC]], was a native of [[Izmir|Smyrna]] of humble origin, but gave himself out to be the son of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and heir to the Seleucid throne. Along with his sister Laodice, the youngster Alexander was &quot;discovered&quot; by Heracleides, a former minister of Antiochus IV and brother of [[Timarchus]], a usurper in [[Media]] who had been executed by the reigning king [[Demetrius I of Syria|Demetrius I Soter]].

Alexander's claims were recognized by the Roman senate, [[Ptolemy VI of Egypt|Ptolemy Philometor of Egypt]] and others. He married [[Cleopatra Thea]], a daughter of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. At first unsuccessful, Alexander finally defeated Demetrius Soter in [[150 BC]]. Being now master of the empire, he is said to have abandoned himself to a life of debauchery. Whatever the truth behind this, the young king was forced to depend heavily on his Ptolemaic support and even struck portraits with the characteristic features of king [[Ptolemy I]].

Demetrius Soter's son [[Demetrius II of Syria|Demetrius II]] profited by the opportunity to regain the throne. Ptolemy Philometor, who was Alexander's father-in-law, went over to his side, and Alexander was defeated in a pitched [[battle of Antioch (145 BC)|battle near Antioch]] in Syria.

He fled for refuge to a [[Nabataea]]n prince, who murdered him and sent his head to Ptolemy Philometor, who had been mortally wounded in the engagement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexander''', tagus or [[despotism|despot]] of [[Pherae]] in [[Thessaly]], ruled from [[369 BC]] to [[358 BC]]. He was the son and successor of the tyrant [[Jason of Pherae]], who was assassinated in [[370 BC]].

Alexander's [[tyranny]] caused the Aleuadae of [[Larissa]] to invoke the aid of [[Alexander II of Macedon]], whose intervention was successful, but after the Macedonian withdrawal Alexander treated his subjects as cruelly as before.  The Thessalians next applied to [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]]; [[Pelopidas]], who was sent to their assistance, was treacherously seized and thrown into prison ([[368 BC|368]]), and it was necessary to send [[Epaminondas]] with a large army to secure his release.  Alexander's conduct caused renewed intervention; in 364 he was defeated at [[Battle of Cynoscephalae (364 BC)|Cynoscephalae]] by the Thebans, although the victory was dearly bought by the loss of Pelopidas, who fell in the battle.

Alexander was at last crushed by the Thebans, compelled to acknowledge the freedom of the Thessalian cities and to limit his rule to Pherae, and forced to join the [[Boeotia]]n league.  He was murdered by his wife's brother at her instigation.  Ancient accounts, such as [[Plutarch]]'s ''Life of Pelopidas,'' agree in describing Alexander as a  cruel and suspicious tyrant:

:''Alexander, the tyrant of Pherae (this last should be his only appellation; he should not be permitted to disgrace the name of Alexander), as he watched a tragic actor, felt himself much moved to pity through enjoyment of the acting. He jumped up, therefore, and left the theatre at a rapid pace, exclaiming that it would be a dreadful thing, if, when he was slaughtering so many citizens, he should be seen to weep over the sufferings of Hecuba and Polyxena. And he came near visiting punishment upon the actor because the man had softened his heart, as iron in the fire.''
:::&amp;mdash;Plutarch, ''Moralia:'' &quot;On the Fortune of Alexander.&quot;

'''Aleksander Jagiellon''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: '''''Aleksander Jagiellończyk'''''; [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: '''''Aleksandras  Jogailaitis'''''; [[1461]] – [[1506]]), King of [[Poland]] and Grand Duke of [[Lithuania]], was the fourth son of [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon]].  He was elected Grand Duke of Lithuania on the death of his father 
([[1492]]), and King of Poland on the death of his brother [[Jan I Olbracht]] ([[1501]]).  

His shortage of funds immediately made him subservient to the Polish Senate and nobility (''szlachta''), who deprived him of control of the mint (then one of the most lucrative sources of revenue for the Polish kings), curtailed his prerogatives, and generally endeavored to reduce him to a subordinate position.  This ill-timed parsimony exerted a deleterious effect on Polish politics.  For want of funds, Aleksander was unable to resist the Grand Master of the [[Teutonic Knights]] or prevent Grand Duke of Muscovy [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] from ravaging Lithuania with the [[Tatars]].  The most the King could do was to garrison [[Smolensk]] and other strongholds and employ his wife Helena, the Tsar's daughter, to mediate a truce between his father-in-law and himself after the disastrous [[Battle of Vedrosha]] (1500). In the terms of the truce, Lithuania had to surrennder about a third of its territory to the nascent Russian state.

During his reign, Poland suffered much humiliation from the attempts of her subject principality, [[Moldavia]], to throw off her yoke.  Only the death of [[Stephen of Moldavia|Stephen]], the great ''[[hospodar]]'' of Moldavia, enabled Poland still to hold her own on the [[Danube River]]; while the liberality of [[Pope Julius II]], who issued no fewer than 29 bulls in favor of Poland and granted Aleksander [[Peter's Pence]] and other financial help, enabled the Polish King to restrain somewhat the arrogance of the Teutonic Order.

In Aleksander, the characteristic virtues of the [[Jagiellon]]s, patience and generosity, degenerated into slothfulness and extravagance.  Frequently he was too poor to pay the expenses of his own table.  He never felt at home in Poland, and bestowed his favor principally upon his fellow-countrymen, the most notable of whom was the wealthy Lithuanian magnate [[Michał Gliński]], who justified his master's confidence by his great victory over the Tatars at Kleck ([[August 5]], [[1506]]), news of which was brought to Aleksander on his deathbed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aleksander Pavlovich Romanov''' or '''Tsar Alexander I (The Blessed)''', ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Александр I Павлович) ([[December 23]], [[1777]]&amp;ndash;[[December 1]], [[1825]]), was  [[Tsar|Emperor]] of [[Russia]] from [[March 23]], [[1801]]&amp;ndash;[[December 1]], [[1825]] and [[King of Poland]] from [[1815]]&amp;ndash;[[1825]], as well as the first Russian [[Grand Duke of Finland]].

He was born in [[Saint Petersburg]] to Grand Duke Paul Petrovich, afterwards [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], and [[Sophie Marie Dorothea of Württemberg|Maria Fedorovna]], daughter of the [[Friedrich II Eugen, Duke of Württemberg|Duke of Württemberg]]. Alexander succeeded to the throne after his father was murdered, and ruled Russia during the chaotic period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  The strange contradictions of his character make Alexander one of the most interesting Tsars, and he is one of the most important figures in the history of 19th century Europe. 

[[Image:Aldawe.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait of Alexander I in the [[Military Gallery]] of the [[Winter Palace]].]]

==Early life==
His complex nature resulted, in truth, from the outcome of the complex character of his early environment and education.  Reared in the free-thinking atmosphere of the court of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]], he had imbibed from his [[Swiss]] tutor, Frederic Caesar de Laharpe, the principles of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s gospel of humanity; from his military governor, [[Nikolay Saltykov]], the traditions of Russian autocracy; while his father had inspired him with his own passion of military parade, and taught him to combine a theoretical love of [[mankind]] with a practical contempt for [[men]].  These contradictory tendencies remained with him through life, revealed in the fluctuations of his policy and influencing through him the [[fate]] of the [[world]].

==Succeeds to the throne==
Another element in his character emerged when on [[March 23]], [[1801]] he mounted the throne over the body of his murdered father: a mystic melancholy liable at any moment to issue in extravagant action.  At first, indeed, this exercised but little influence on the [[Emperor of Russia | Emperor]]'s life.  Young, emotional, impressionable, well-meaning and egotistic, Alexander displayed from the first an intention of playing a great part on the world's stage, and plunged with all the ardour of youth into the task of realizing his political ideals.  While retaining for a time the old [[Political minister | ministers]] who had served and overthrown the Emperor Paul, one of the first acts of his reign was to appoint the [[Private Committee]], also called ironically the &quot;[[Committee of Public Safety |Comite du salut public]]&quot;, consisting of young and enthusiastic friends of his own - [[Victor Palvovich Kochubey|Victor Kochubey]], [[Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev|Nikolay Novosiltsev]], [[Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov|Pavel Stroganov]] and [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]] - to draw up a scheme of internal reform.  Most importantly the liberal [[Mikhail Speransky]] became one of the Tsar's closest advisors, and drew up many plans for elaborate reforms.  Their aims, inspired by their admiration for [[Kingdom of Great Britain | English]] institutions, far outstripped the possibilities of the time, and even after they had been raised to regular ministerial positions but little of their programme could come to pass.  For [[Imperial Russia | Russia]] was not ripe for [[liberty]]; and Alexander, the disciple of the [[revolution]]ist Laharpe, was&amp;mdash;as he himself said&amp;mdash;but &quot;a happy accident&quot; on the throne of the tsars.  He spoke, indeed, bitterly of &quot;the state of [[barbarism]] in which the country had been left by the traffic in men.&quot;

==Early reign==
&quot;Under Paul,&quot; he said, &quot;three thousand [[peasant]]s had been given away like a bag of [[diamond]]s.  If [[civilization]] were more advanced, I would abolish this [[slavery]], if it cost me my [[head (anatomy)|head]]&quot;. But the universal [[Political corruption|corruption]], he complained, had left him no men; and the filling up of the government offices with [[German people|Germans]] and other foreigners merely accentuated the sullen resistance of the &quot;old [[Russians]]&quot; to his reforms.  That Alexander's reign, which began with so large a promise of amelioration, ended by riveting still tighter the chains of the Russian people was, however, due less to the corruption and backwardness of Russian life than to the defects of the tsar himself.  His love of liberty, though sincere, was in fact unreal.  It flattered his [[vanity]] to pose before the world as the dispenser of benefits; but his theoretical [[liberalism]] linked with an [[autocratic]] will which brooked no contradiction. &quot;You always want to instruct me!&quot; he exclaimed to [[Gavril Romanovich Derzhavin|Derzhavin]], the [[List of Justice Ministers of Imperial Russia|Minister of Justice]], &quot;but I am the autocratic emperor, and I will this, and nothing else!&quot; &quot;He would gladly have agreed,&quot; wrote Prince Czartoryski, &quot;that every one should be free, if every one had freely done only what he wished.&quot; Moreover, this masterful temper joined an infirmity of purpose which ever let &quot;I dare not wait upon I would,&quot; and which seized upon any excuse for postponing measures the principles of which he had publicly approved.

===Legal reform===
[[Image:Althorv.jpg|thumb|225px|Bust of Alexander I, by [[Thorvaldsen]].]] The codification of the laws initiated in 1801 was never carried out during his reign; nothing was done to improve the intolerable status of the Russian peasantry; the constitution drawn up by [[Mikhail Speransky]], and passed by the emperor, remained unsigned.  Alexander, in fact, who, without being consciously tyrannical, possessed in full measure the [[tyrant]]'s characteristic distrust of men of ability and independent judgment, lacked also the first requisite for a reforming sovereign: confidence in his people; and it was this want that vitiated such reforms as were actually realized.  He experimented in the outlying provinces of his [[Empire]]; and the Russians noted with open [[murmur]]s that, not content with governing through foreign instruments, he was conferring on [[Poland]], [[Finland]] and the [[Baltic States | Baltic provinces]] benefits denied to themselves.

===Social reforms===
::''Main articles: [[Government reform of Alexander I]] and [[Mikhail Speransky]]''

In Russia, too, certain reforms were carried out; but they could not survive the suspicious interference of the autocrat and his officials. The newly created [[Russian Council of Ministers| Council of Ministers]] and [[State Council]] under [[Governing Senate]], endowed for the first time with certain theoretical powers, became in the end but the slavish instruments of the Tsar and his favorites of the moment.  The elaborate system of [[Education]], culminating in the reconstituted, or new-founded, [[university|universities]] of [[Dorpat]], [[Vilna]], [[Kazan]] and [[Kharkov]], was strangled in the supposed interests of &quot;order&quot; and of [[Russian Orthodox Church | Orthodox]] [[piety]]; while the [[military settlements]] which Alexander proclaimed as a blessing to both [[soldier]]s and [[state]] were forced on the unwilling peasantry and army with pitiless cruelty.  Even the [[Bible]] [[Society]], through which the Emperor in his later mood of [[evangelism|evangelical]] zeal proposed to bless his people, was conducted on the same ruthless lines.  The [[Roman Catholic Church | Roman]] [[Archbishop]] and the Orthodox [[Metropolitan bishop | Metropolitans]] were forced to serve on its committee side by side with [[Protestant]] [[pastor]]s; and [[village]] [[priest]]s, trained to regard any tampering with the letter of the traditional documents of the [[Christian Church | Church]] as [[mortal sin]], became the unwilling instruments for the propagation of what they regarded as works of the [[Devil]].

==Influence on European politics==
===Views held by his contemporaries===
Autocrat and &quot;[[Jacobin]]&quot;, man of the world and mystic, he appeared to his contemporaries as a riddle which each read according to his own temperament.  [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] thought him a &quot;shifty [[Derogatory use of Byzantine|Byzantine]]&quot;, and called him the [[François Joseph Talma|Talma]] of the North, as ready to play any conspicuous part.  To [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]] he was a madman to be humoured.  [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]], writing of him to Lord Liverpool, gives him credit for &quot;grand qualities,&quot; but adds that he is &quot;suspicious and undecided&quot;.
Alexander's grandiose imagination was, however, more strongly attracted by the great questions of [[Europe]]an politics than by attempts at domestic reform which, on the whole, wounded his pride by proving to him the narrow limits of absolute power.

===Alliances with other powers===
On the morrow of his accession he had reversed the policy of Paul, denounced the League of Neutrals, and made peace with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (April, [[1801]]), at the same time opening negotiations with [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]].  Soon afterwards at [[Memel]] he entered into a close alliance with [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], not as he boasted from motives of policy, but in the spirit of true [[chivalry]], out of [[friendship]] for the young [[List of Kings of Prussia|King]] [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] and his beautiful wife [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]].  The development of this alliance was interrupted by the short-lived peace of October,  [[1801]]; and for a while it seemed as though [[French Consulate|France]] and [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] might come to an understanding.  Carried away by the enthusiasm of Laharpe, who had returned to [[Russia]] from [[Paris]], Alexander began openly to proclaim his admiration for French institutions and for the person of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoléon Bonaparte]] .  Soon, however, came a change.  Laharpe, after a new visit to Paris, presented to the Tsar his Reflexions on the True Nature of the Consulship for Life, which, as Alexander said, tore the veil from his eyes, and revealed Bonaparte &quot;as not a true [[Patriotism|patriot]]&quot;, but only as &quot;the most famous tyrant the world has produced.&quot; His disillusionment was completed by the murder of the [[Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Condé, duc d'Enghien|duc d'Enghien]].  The Russian court went into mourning for the last of the [[Prince of Condé|Condés]], and diplomatic relations with Paris were broken off.

===Opposition to Napoleon===
The events of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] that followed belong to the general history of [[Europe]]; but the Tsar's attitude throughout is personal to himself, though pregnant with issues momentous for the world.  In opposing Napoleon I, &quot;the oppressor of Europe and the disturber of the world's peace,&quot; Alexander in fact already believed himself to be fulfilling a divine mission.  In his instructions to Novosiltsov, his special envoy in [[London]], the Tsar elaborated the motives of his policy in language which appealed as little to the common sense of the prime minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]], as did later the treaty of the [[Holy Alliance]] to that of the foreign minister, Castlereagh.  Yet the document is of great interest, as in it we find formulated for the first time in an official despatch those exalted ideals of international policy which were to play so conspicuous a part in the affairs of the world at the close of the revolutionary epoch, and issued at the end of the 19th century in the Rescript of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and the conference of the [[Hague]].  The outcome of the [[war]], Alexander argued, was not to be only the liberation of France, but the universal triumph of &quot;the [[sacred]] [[Human rights |rights of humanity]]&quot;. To attain this it would be necessary &quot;after having attached the [[nation]]s to their [[government]] by making these incapable of acting save in the greatest interests of their subjects, to fix the relations of the states amongst each other on more precise rules, and such as it is to their interest to respect.&quot;

A general treaty was to become the basis of the relations of the states forming &quot;the European Confederation&quot;; and this, though &quot;it was no question of realizing the dream of universal peace, would attain some of its results if, at the conclusion of the general war, it were possible to establish on clear principles the prescriptions of the rights of nations.&quot; &quot;Why could not one submit to it,&quot; the Tsar continued, &quot;the positive rights of nations, assure the privilege of neutrality, insert the obligation of never beginning war until all the resources which the mediation of a third party could offer have been exhausted, having by this means brought to light the respective grievances, and tried to remove them? It is on such principles as these that one could proceed to a general pacification, and give birth to a league of which the stipulations would form, so to speak, a new code of the law of nations, which, sanctioned by the greater part of the nations of Europe, would without difficulty become the immutable rule of the cabinets, while those who should try to infringe it would risk bringing upon themselves the forces of the new union.&quot;

===1807 loss to French forces===
[[Image:Alkruger.jpg|thumb|300px|Equestrian portrait of Alexander I (1812)]]

Meanwhile Napoleon, a little deterred by the Russian autocrat's youthful ideology, never gave up hope of detaching him from the coalition.  He had no sooner entered [[Vienna]] in triumph than he opened negotiations with him; he resumed them after the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] ([[December 2]], [[1805]]).  [[Imperial Russia]] and France, he urged, were &quot;geographical allies&quot;; there was, and could be, between them no true conflict of interests; together they might rule the world.  But Alexander was still determined &quot;to persist in the system of disinterestedness in respect of all the states of Europe which he had thus far followed,&quot; and he again allied himself with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].  The campaign of [[Jena]] and the [[battle of Eylau]] followed; and Napoleon, though still intent on the Russian alliance, stirred up [[Poles]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Persians]] to break the obstinacy of the Tsar.  A party too in Russia itself, headed by the Tsar's brother [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Constantine Pavlovich]], was clamorous for peace; but Alexander, after a vain attempt to form a new coalition, summoned the Russian nation to a holy war against Napoleon as the enemy of the Orthodox faith.  The outcome was the rout of [[Friedland]] ([[June 13]]/ [[June 14 |14]], [[1807]]).  Napoleon saw his chance and seized it.  Instead of making heavy terms, he offered to the chastened autocrat his alliance, and a partnership in his glory. 

The two Emperors met at Tilsit on the [[25 June]], [[1807]]. Alexander, dazzled by Napoleon's [[genius]] and overwhelmed by his apparent generosity, was completely won.  Napoleon knew well how to appeal to the exuberant imagination of his new-found friend.  He would divide with Alexander the Empire of the world; as a first step he would leave him in possession of the [[Danube River | Danubian]] principalities and give him a free hand to deal with [[Finland]]; and, afterwards, the Emperors of the [[Eastern Roman Empire | East]] and [[Western Roman Empire | West]], when the time should be ripe, would drive the [[Ottoman Empire | Turks]] from Europe and march across [[Asia]] to the conquest of [[Indian subcontinent | India]].  A programme so stupendous awoke in Alexander's impressionable mind an ambition to which he had hitherto been a stranger.  The interests of Europe were forgotten. &quot;What is Europe?&quot; he exclaimed to the French ambassador. &quot;Where is it, if it is not you and we?&quot;

===Prussia===
The brilliance of these new visions did not, however, blind Alexander to the obligations of friendship; and he refused to retain the Danubian principalities as the price for suffering a further dismemberment of Prussia. &quot;We have made loyal war,&quot; he said, &quot;we must make a loyal peace.&quot; It was not long before the first enthusiasm of [[Tilsit]] began to wane.  Napoleon I was prodigal of promises, but niggard of their fulfilment.  The French remained in Prussia, the Russians on the Danube; and each accused the other of breach of faith.  Meanwhile, however, the personal relations of Alexander and Napoleon were of the most cordial character; and it was hoped that a fresh meeting might adjust all differences between 
them.  The meeting took place at [[Erfurt]] in October, [[1808]], and resulted in a treaty which defined the common policy of the two Emperors.  But Alexander's relations with Napoleon none the less suffered a change.  He realized that in Napoleon sentiment never got the better of reason, that as a matter of fact he had never intended his proposed &quot;grand enterprise&quot; 
seriously, and had only used it to preoccupy the mind of the Tsar while he consolidated his own power in [[Central Europe]].  From this moment the French alliance was for Alexander also not a fraternal agreement to rule the world, but an affair of pure policy.  He used it, in the first instance, to remove &quot;the geographical enemy&quot; from the gates of [[Saint Petersburg]] by wresting [[Finland]] from the [[Sweden|Swedes]] ([[1809]]); and he hoped by means of it to make the Danube the southern frontier of Russia.

===Franco-Russian Alliance===
Events were in fact rapidly tending to the rupture of the Franco-Russian alliance.  Alexander, indeed, assisted Napoleon in the war of [[1809]], but he declared plainly that he would not allow the [[Austrian Empire]] to be crushed out of existence; and Napoleon complained bitterly of the inactivity of the Russian troops during the campaign.  The Tsar in his turn protested against Napoleon's encouragement of the [[Poles]].  In the matter of the French alliance he knew himself to be practically isolated in Russia, and he declared that he could not sacrifice the interest of his people and empire to his affection for Napoleon. &quot;I don't want anything for myself,&quot; he said to the French ambassador, &quot;therefore the world is not large enough to come to an understanding on the affairs of [[Poland]], if it is a question of its restoration.&quot; 

The treaty of Vienna, which added largely to the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], he complained had &quot;ill requited him for his loyalty,&quot; and he was only mollified for the time by Napoleon's public declaration that he had no intention of restoring Poland, and by a convention, signed on the [[4 January]], [[1810]] but not ratified, abolishing the Polish name and orders of [[chivalry]].

But if Alexander suspected Napoleon, Napoleon was no less suspicious of Alexander; and, partly to test his sincerity, he sent an almost peremptory request for the hand of the [[Grand Duchess]] Anne, the younger sister of the Tsar.  After some little delay Alexander returned a polite refusal, on the plea of the tender age of the [[Princess]] and the objection of the [[Empress dowager]] [[Sophie Marie Dorothea of Württemberg|Maria Fyodorovna]] to the marriage.  Napoleon's answer was to refuse to ratify the convention of the [[4 January]], [[1810]] and to announce his engagement to the [[Archduke |Archduchess]] [[Marie Louise of Austria|Marie Louise]] in such a way as to lead Alexander to suppose that the two marriage treaties had been negotiated simultaneously.  From this time the relation between the two emperors gradually became more and more strained.

The annexation of [[Oldenburg (state) | Oldenburg]], of which the [[Peter Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Oldenburg|Duke of Oldenburg]] ([[January 3]], [[1754]]&amp;ndash;[[July 2]], [[1823]]) was the Tsar's uncle, to [[France]] in December, [[1810]], added another to the personal grievances of Alexander against Napoleon; while the ruinous reaction of &quot;the continental system&quot; on Russian trade made it impossible for the Tsar to maintain a policy which was Napoleon's chief motive for the alliance.  An acid correspondence followed, and ill-concealed armaments, which culminated in the [[Summer]] of [[1812]] in Napoleon's invasion of Russia.  Yet, even after the French had passed the frontier, Alexander still protested that his personal sentiments towards the Emperor were unaltered; &quot;but,&quot; he added, &quot;[[God]] Himself cannot undo the past.&quot; It was the occupation of [[Moscow]] and the desecration of the [[Kremlin]], the sacred centre of Holy Russia, that changed his sentiment for Napoleon into passionate hatred.  In vain the French Emperor, within eight days of his entry into Moscow, wrote to the Tsar a letter, which was  one long cry of distress, revealing the desperate straits of the [[Grand Army]], and appealed to &quot;any remnant of his former sentiments.&quot; Alexander returned no answer to these 
&quot;fanfaronnades.&quot; &quot;No more peace with Napoleon!&quot; he cried, &quot;He or I, I or He: we cannot longer reign together!&quot;

===The campaign of 1812===
[[Image:Russparis.jpg|thumb|350px|''Russian army enters [[Paris]] in [[1814]]''.]]
The campaign of [[1812]] was the turning-point of Alexander's life; and its horrors, for which his sensitive nature felt much of the responsibility, overset still more a mind never too well balanced. When Napoleon crossed the Russian border with his [[Grand Army]], Alexander I was quite unprepared for the war, trusting the Francophile chancellor [[Rumyantsev|Nikolay Rumyantsev]] more than his French ambassador [[Alexander Kurakin]], who had warned him about Napoleon's bellicose plans. Russia proclaimed a [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|Patriotic War]] in defence of the Motherland. At the burning of [[Moscow]], he declared afterwards, his own [[soul]] had found illumination, and he had realized once for all the divine revelation to him of his mission as the peacemaker of Europe.  He tried to calm the unrest of his conscience by correspondence with the leaders of the [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] revival on the [[continent]], and sought for [[omen]]s and [[supernatural]] guidance in texts and passages of [[scripture]].  It was not, however, according to his own account, till he met the [[Barbara Juliana, Baroness von Krudener|Baroness de Krüdener]] &amp;mdash; a religious adventuress who made the conversion of princes her special mission&amp;mdash;at [[Basel]], in the [[Autumn]] of [[1813]], that his soul found peace.  From this time a [[mystic]] [[pietism]] became the avowed force of his political, as of his private actions.  Madame de Krüdener, and her colleague, the evangelist Empaytaz, became the confidants of the Emperor's most secret thoughts; and during the campaign that ended in the occupation of [[Paris]] the imperial [[prayer]]-meetings were the [[oracle]] on whose revelations hung the fate of the world.

==Liberal political views==
From the end of the year [[1818]] Alexander's views began to change.  A [[revolution]]ary [[conspiracy]] among the officers of the guard, and a foolish plot to kidnap him on his way to the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle]], are said to have shaken the foundations of his [[Liberalism]].  At Aix he came for the first time into intimate contact with Metternich, and the astute Austrian was swift to take advantage of the psychological moment.  From this time dates the ascendancy of Metternich over the mind of the Russian Emperor and in the councils of Europe.  It was, however, no case of sudden conversion.  Though alarmed by the revolutionary agitation in Germany, which culminated in the murder of his agent, the dramatist [[August von Kotzebue]] ([[March 23]], [[1819]]), Alexander approved of Castlereagh's protest against Metternich's policy of &quot;the governments contracting an alliance against the peoples,&quot; as formulated in the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] of July, [[1819]], and deprecated any intervention of Europe to support &quot;a league of which the sole object is the absurd pretensions of absolute power.&quot;

He still declared his belief in &quot;free institutions, though not in such as age forced from feebleness, nor contracts ordered by popular leaders from their sovereigns, nor constitutions granted in difficult circumstances to tide over a crisis. &quot;Liberty,&quot; he maintained, &quot;should be confined within just limits.  And the limits of liberty are the principles of order&quot;.

It was the apparent triumph of the principles of disorder in the revolutions of [[Naples]] and [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], combined with increasingly disquieting symptoms of discontent in France, Germany, and among his own people, that completed Alexander's conversion.  In the seclusion of the little town of [[Troppau]], where in October of [[1820]] the powers met in conference, Metternich found an opportunity for cementing his influence over Alexander, which had been wanting amid the turmoil and feminine intrigues of Vienna and Aix. Here, in confidence begotten of friendly chats over afternoon tea, the disillusioned autocrat confessed his mistake. &quot;You have nothing to regret,&quot; he said sadly to the exultant chancellor, &quot;but I have!&quot;

The issue was momentous. In January Alexander had still upheld the ideal of a free confederation of the European states, symbolized by the Holy Alliance, against the policy of a dictatorship of the great powers, symbolized by the Quadruple Treaty; he had still protested against the claims of collective Europe to interfere in the internal concerns of the sovereign states.  On [[19 November]] he signed the [[Troppau Protocol]], which consecrated the principle of intervention and wrecked the harmony of the concert.

==The revolt of the Greeks==
At [[Congress of Laibach]], whither in the [[Spring (season)|Spring]] of [[1821]] the congress had been adjourned, Alexander first heard of the [[Greek War of Independence | Revolt of the Greeks]].  From this time until his death his mind was torn between his anxiety to realize his dream of a confederation of Europe and his traditional mission as leader of the Orthodox crusade against the [[Ottoman Empire]].  At first, under the careful nursing of Metternich, the former motive prevailed.

He struck the name of [[Alexander Ypsilanti (1792-1828)|Alexander Ypsilanti]] from the Russian army list, and directed his foreign minister, [[John Capodistria | Giovanni, Count Capo d'Istria]], himself a Greek, to disavow all sympathy of [[Russia]] with his enterprise; and, next year, a deputation of the [[Morea]] Greeks on its way to the [[Congress of Verona]] was turned back by his orders on the road.

He made, indeed, some effort to reconcile the principles at conflict in his mind.  He offered to surrender the claim, successfully asserted when the [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] had been excluded from the Holy Alliance and the affairs of the [[Ottoman empire]] from the deliberations of Vienna, that the affairs of the East were the &quot;domestic concerns of Russia,&quot; and to march into the [[Ottoman Empire]], as Austria had marched into [[Naples]], &quot;as the mandatory of Europe.&quot;

Metternich's opposition to this, illogical, but natural from the Austrian point of view, first opened his eyes to the true character of Austria's attitude towards his ideals.  Once more in Russia, far from the fascination of Metternich's personality, the immemorial spirit of his people drew him back into itself; and when, in the Autumn of [[1825]], he took his dying Empress [[Louise of Baden]] ([[January 24]], [[1779]]&amp;ndash;[[May 26]], [[1826]]) for change of air to the south of Russia, in order&amp;mdash;as all Europe supposed&amp;mdash;to place himself at the head of the great army concentrated near the Ottoman frontiers, his language was no longer that of &quot;the peace-maker of Europe,&quot; but of the Orthodox Tsar determined to take the interests of his people and of his religion &quot;into his own hands&quot;. Before the momentous issue could be decided, however, Alexander died in [[Taganrog]] on [[1 December]] ([[November 18]], [[Julian calendar | O.S.]]) [[1825]], &quot;crushed&quot;, to use his own words, &quot;beneath the terrible burden of a crown&quot; which he had more than once declared his intention of resigning.  A report, current at the time and often revived, affirmed that he did not in fact die.  By some it is supposed that a mysterious hermit named Fomich, who lived at Tomsk until [[1870]] and was treated with peculiar deference by successive Tsars [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] and [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], was none other than Alexander.

==A tragic figure==
Modern history knows no more tragic figure than that of Alexander.  The brilliant promise of his early years; the haunting memory of the [[crime]] by which he had obtained the power to realize his ideals; and, in the end, the terrible legacy he left to Russia: a principle of government which, under lofty pretensions, veiled a tyranny supported by [[spies]] and [[secret police]]; an uncertain succession; an army permeated by organized disaffection; an armed Poland, whose hunger for liberty the tsar had whetted but not satisfied; the quarrel with the [[Ottoman Empire]], with its alternative of war or humiliation for Russia; an educational system rotten with official hypocrisy; a Church in which conduct counted for nothing, [[Orthodoxy]] and ceremonial observance for everything; economical and financial conditions scarce recovering from the verge of ruin; and lastly, that curse of Russia&amp;mdash;[[serfdom]].

==Private life==
In private life Alexander displayed many lovable qualities.  All authorities combine in praising his handsome presence and the affability and charm of his address, together with a certain simplicity of personal tastes, which led him in his intercourse with his friends or with the representatives of friendly powers to dispense with ceremony and etiquette.  His personal friendship, too, once bestowed, was never lightly withdrawn.  By nature he was sociable and pleasure-loving, he proved himself a notable patron of the arts and he took a conspicuous part in all the gaieties of the [[congress of Vienna]].  In his later years, however, he fell into a mood of settled melancholy; and, though still accessible to all who chose to approach him with complaints or petitions, he withdrew from all but the most essential social functions, and lived a life of strenuous work and of Spartan simplicity.  His gloom had been increased by domestic misfortune.  He had been married, on [[October 9]], [[1793]], without his wishes being consulted, to the beautiful and amiable princess [[Louise of Baden]] (Elisabeth Alexeyevna), a political match which, as he regretfully confessed to his friend [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]], had proved the misfortune of both; and he consoled himself in the traditional manner.  The two children of the marriage, a little grand-duchess Elizaveta, died on [[12 May]] [[1808]] and the other little grand-duchess Maria, that died six years earlier on [[26 June]] (or [[8 July]]) [[1800]]; and their common sorrow drew husband and wife closer together. Towards the close of his life their reconciliation was completed by the wise charity of the Empress in sympathizing deeply with him over the death of his beloved daughter by [[Princess Maria Naryshkina]].

==Death==
Tsar Alexander I, the man of mystery, became increasingly involved in [[mysticism]] and increasingly more suspicious of those around him. On the way to the conference in [[Aachen]], [[Germany]], an attempt had been made to kidnap him. Now he would trust no one. At home, his young daughter, an only child, died, and his wife became ill.

In [[1825]], the &quot;Tsar of All the Russians&quot; died in the city of [[Taganrog]]. After an official announcement of the Tsar's death, a British ambassador at the Russian court said he had seen Alexander boarding a ship. It was later rumored that a [[monk]] in [[Siberia]], Feodor Kuzmich, was really the former ruler. Whatever the truth, when the [[Soviet]] Government opened Alexander's grave many, many years later, it was empty.

Within weeks of Alexander's death, there was an unsuccessful attempt by liberal-minded military officers to seize power from the crown, now known as the [[Decembrist Revolt]].  The Decembrists were caught off guard by confusion regarding the order of succession.  Historians believe that the secret societies to wrest power from the crown appeared after the Russian officers' return from their [[Napoleonic wars|Napoleonic campaigns]] in [[Europe]] in 1815.

==Offspring==
He had other illegitimate children, nine all together. His other mistresses were [[Sophia Vsevolojsky]], [[Maria Ivanovna Katatcharova]], [[Veronica Dzierzanowska]], [[Marguerite-Josephine Weimer]], and Princess [[Barbara Tourkestanova]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AlexanderIIRussia.jpeg|frame|right|Alexander II (1818-1881)]] 

'''Alexander (Aleksandr) II Nikolaevitch ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Александр II Николаевич)''' ([[April 17]] [[1818]], [[Moscow]]&amp;ndash;[[March 13]] [[1881]]) was the Emperor ([[Czar]]) of [[Russia]] from [[March 2]] [[1855]] until his [[assassination]]. He was also the [[Grand Duke of Finland]].

Born in 1818 and assassinated in 1881, he was the eldest son of Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] and [[Charlotte of Prussia]], daughter of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]. His early life gave little indication of his ultimate potential, and up to the time of his accession in [[1855]], few imagined that he would be known to posterity as a great reformer.

==Early life==
Insofar as he may have had political convictions in his youth, Alexander seemed to possess the reactionary spirit predominant in Europe at the time of his birth, a trend which continued in [[Russia]] through to the end of his father's reign. In the period of thirty years during which he was [[heir apparent]], the atmosphere of [[Saint Petersburg, Russia|St. Petersburg]] was unfavourable to the development of any intellectual or political innovation. Government was based on principles under which all freedom of thought and all private initiative were, as far as possible, suppressed vigorously. Personal and official [[censorship]] was rife; criticism of the authorities was regarded as a serious offence.

Under supervision of the liberal poet [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], Alexander received the education commonly given to young Russians of good family at that time: a smattering of a great many subjects, and a good practical acquaintance with the chief modern [[Europe|European]] [[European languages|languages]]. He took little personal interest in military affairs. To the disappointment of his father, who was passionate about the [[military]], he showed no love of soldiering. Alexander gave evidence of a kind disposition and a tender-heartedness which were considered out of place in one destined to become a military [[autocrat]].

==Marriages and Children==
[[Image:Cartetsar.JPG|thumb|right|Tsar Alexander II, his wife Marie and son, the future Alexander III]]
On [[April 16]] [[1841]] he married [[Marie of Hesse and by Rhine|Princess Marie of Hesse]] in St. Petersburg, the daughter of [[Ludwig II, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine]], thereafter known as [[Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Maria Alexandrovna]]. The marriage produced six sons and two daughters:
* [[Alexandra Alexandrovna]] (1842-1849).
* [[Nicholas Alexandrovich]] (1843-1865). He was engaged to princess Dagmar of Denmark, who later married his brother Alexander III under the name [[Maria Fyodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Fyodorovna]].
* [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander Alexandrovich]], the future emperor
* [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Maria Alexandrovna]] (1853-1920). Married [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].
* [[Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia]] (1847-1909). Married Princess Marie of [[Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] and had issue: three sons (Grand Dukes Kirill, Boris and Andrey Vladimirovich) and a daughter (Grand Duchess Elena, who married Prince Nicholas of Greece).
* [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia|Alexei Alexandrovich]] (1850-1908). Married Alexandra Zhukovsky and had a son (executed by the Communist regime in 1932).
* [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia]] (1857-1905). Assassinated. Married [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Elisabeth]] of [[Hesse-Darmstadt]], who was murdered by the Bolsheviks in Alapaevsk in 1918. They had no children.
* [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia|Paul Alexandrovich of Russia]] (1860-1919). Married first [[Alexandra Yurievna of Greece|Alexandra of Greece]] (daughter of [[George I of Greece]]) and second Olga Karnovich von Pistolkors, [[Princess Paley]], and had issue by both. Both Grand Duke Paul and his son Prince [[Vladimir Paley]] (1897-1918), a remarkable poet, were killed by the Bolsheviks.

On [[July 6]] [[1880]], less than a month after Tsarina Maria's death on [[June 8]], Alexander formed a [[morganatic marriage]] with his mistress Princess [[Catherine Dolgoruki]], with whom he already had three children. A fourth child would be born to them before his death.

* George Alexandrovich Romanov Yurievsky (1872-1913). Married Countess Alexandra Zarnekau and had issue. They later divorced.
* Olga Alexandrovna Romanov Yurievsky (1873-1925). Married Count George von [[Merenberg]].
* Boris Alexandrovich Yurievsky (1876-1876).
* Catherine Alexandrovna Romanov Yurievsky (1878-1959). Married first Prince Alexander V. Bariatinsky and second Prince Serge Obolensky, whom she later divorced.

==Emperor== 
[[Image:AlexanderII_of_Russia(monument).jpg|thumb|200px|New monument to Alexander II in front of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in Moscow.]]
Alexander succeeded to the throne upon the death of his father in 1855. The first year of his reign was devoted to the prosecution of the [[Crimean War]], and after the fall of [[Sevastopol]] to negotiations for peace, led by his trusted counselor, [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]]. Then he began a period of radical reforms, encouraged by public opinion but carried out with autocratic power. All who had any pretensions to enlightenment declared loudly that the country had been exhausted and humiliated by the war, and that the only way of restoring it to its proper position in Europe was to develop its natural resources and thoroughly to reform all branches of the administration. The government therefore found in the educated classes a new-born public spirit, anxious to assist it in any work of reform that it might think fit to undertake.

Fortunately for Russia the autocratic power was now in the hands of a man who was impressionable enough to be deeply influenced by the spirit of the time, and who had sufficient prudence and practicality to prevent his being carried away by the prevailing excitement into the dangerous region of [[Utopia|utopian]] dreaming. Unlike some of his predecessors, he had no grand, original schemes of his own to impose by force on unwilling subjects, and no pet projects to lead his judgment astray. He looked instinctively with a suspicious, critical eye upon the panaceas which more imaginative and less cautious people recommended. These character traits, together with the peculiar circumstances in which he was placed, determined the part which he was to, in great measure, brought to fruition the reform aspirations of the educated classes.

However, the growth of a revolutionary movement to the &quot;left&quot; of the educated classes led to an abrupt end to Alexander's changes when he was assassinated by a bomb in 1881. It is interesting to note that after Alexander became czar in 1855, he maintained a generally liberal course at the helm while providing a target for numerous assassination attempts (1866,1873,1880).

==Emancipation of the serfs==
:''Main article: [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia]].''

Though he carefully guarded his autocratic rights and privileges, and obstinately resisted all efforts to push him farther than he felt inclined to go, Alexander for several years acted somewhat like a constitutional sovereign of the continental type. Soon after the conclusion of peace, important changes were made in legislation concerning industry and commerce, and the new freedom thus afforded produced a large number of [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]]. At the same time, plans were formed for building a great network of [[railroad|railways]] &amp;mdash; partly for the purpose of developing the natural resources of the country, and partly for the purpose of increasing its power for defense and attack. [[Image:Chenstokhov.jpg|thumb|275px|A monument to Alexander II in [[Jasna Góra Monastery|Chestochowa]].]]

Then it was found that further progress was blocked by a formidable obstacle: the existence of [[serfdom]]. Alexander showed that, unlike his father, he meant to grapple boldly with this difficult and dangerous problem. Taking advantage of a petition presented by the [[Poland|Polish]] [[landed proprietor]]s of the [[Lithuania|Lithuanian]] provinces, and hoping that their relations with the serfs might be regulated in a more satisfactory way (meaning in a way more satisfactory for the proprietors), he authorized the formation of committees &quot;for ameliorating the condition of the peasants,&quot; and laid down the principles on which the amelioration was to be effected.

This step was followed by one still more significant. Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to send a circular to the provincial governors of European Russia, containing a copy of the instructions forwarded to the governor-general of Lithuania, praising the supposed generous, patriotic intentions of the Lithuanian landed proprietors, and suggesting that perhaps the landed proprietors of other provinces might express a similar desire. The hint was taken: in all provinces where serfdom existed, emancipation committees were formed.

The deliberations at once raised a host of important, thorny questions. The emancipation was not merely a humanitarian question capable of being solved instantaneously by imperial ''[[ukase]]''. It contained very complicated problems, deeply affecting the economic, social and political future of the nation.

Alexander had little of the special knowledge required for dealing successfully with such problems, and he had to restrict himself to choosing between the different measures recommended to him. The main point at issue was whether the serfs should become agricultural labourers dependent economically and administratively on the landlords, or whether they should be transformed into a class of independent communal proprietors. The emperor gave his support to the latter project, and the Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in Europe to shake off serfdom.

The architects of the emancipation manifesto were Alexander's brother [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Konstantin]], [[Yakov Rostovtsev]], and [[Nikolay Milyutin]]. On [[March 3]] [[1861]], the sixth anniversary of his accession, the emancipation law was signed and published.

==Other reforms==
[[Image:AlexII.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A portrait of Alexander II in St. Petersburg]]
Other reforms followed: [[army]] and [[navy]] re-organization (1874); a new judicial administration based on the [[France|French]] model (1864); a new [[penal code]] and a greatly simplified system of civil and criminal procedure; an elaborate scheme of local self-government for the rural districts (1864) and the large towns (1870), with elective assemblies possessing a restricted right of [[taxation]], and a new rural and municipal [[police]] under the direction of the [[MVD|Minister of the Interior]].

However, the workers wanted better worker conditions; national minorities wanted freedom.  When radicals began to resort to the formation of secret societies and to revolutionary agitation, Alexander II felt constrained to adopt severe repressive measures.

Alexander II resolved to try the effect of some moderate liberal reforms in an attempt to quell the revolutionary agitation, and for this purpose he instituted a [[ukase]] for creating special commissions, composed of high officials and private personages who should prepare reforms in various branches of the administration.

==Suppression of national movements==
At the beginning of his reign, Alexander expressed the famous statement &quot;No dreams&quot; addressed for Poles, populating [[Congress Poland]], Western [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]], [[Livonia]] and [[Belarus]]. The result was the [[January Uprising]] of 1863-4 that was suppressed after eighteen months of fighting. Thousands of Poles were executed, tens of thousands were deported to [[Siberia]]. The price for suppression was Russian support for Prussian-united Germany. Twenty years later, Germany became the major enemy of Russia on continent.

All territories of the former [[Poland-Lithuania]] were excluded from liberal polices introduced by Alexander. The martial law in Lithuania, introduced in 1863, lasted for the next 50 years. Native languages, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] were completely banned from printed texts, see, e.g., [[Ems Ukase]]. The [[Polish language]] was banned in both oral and written form from all provinces except [[Congress Kingdom]], where it was allowed in private conversations only .

==Assassination attempts==
In [[1866]] there was an attempt on his life in [[Petersburg]] by [[Dmitry Karakozov]]. To commemorate his narrow escape from death (that he referred to only as &quot;the event of April 4, 1866&quot;) he held a competition to design a great gate for the city. Architect, painter and costume designer [[Viktor Hartmann]] won the competition. The design was well-received and Hartmann thought it was his finest work, but it would never be built. The painting of the design later became [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky's]] inspiration for ''The Great Gate of Kiev'' from ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]''.

On the morning of [[April 20]] [[1879]], Alexander II was walking towards the Square of the Guards Staff and faced Alexander Soloviev, a 33 year-old former student. Having seen a revolver in his hands, the Tsar ran away; Soloviev fired five times but missed. He was sentenced to death and hanged on [[May 28]]. [[Image:Sankt Petersburg Auferstehungskirche 2005 d.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] commemorates the spot where Alexander was assassinated.]]

The student acted on his own, but other revolutionaries were keen to kill Alexander. In December [[1879]], the [[Narodnaya Volya]] (People's Will), a radical revolutionary group which hoped to ignite a social revolution, organised an explosion on the railway from [[Livadia]] to [[Moscow]], but they missed the Tsar's train. Subsequently, on the evening of [[February 5]], [[1880]] the same revolutionaries set off a charge under the dining room of the [[Winter Palace]], right in the resting room of the Guards a story below. The Tsar was not harmed as he was late to the supper, and the explosion did not destroy the dining room either, although the floor was heavily damaged.

==Assassination==
After the last assassination attempt, [[Michael Tarielovich, Count Loris-Melikov|Count Loris-Melikov]] was appointed the head of the Supreme Executive Commission and given extraordinary powers to fight the revolutionaries. Loris-Melikov's proposals called for some form of parliamentary body, and the Emperor seemed to agree; these plans were never realized as on [[March 13]] ([[March 1]] [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]), [[1881]] Alexander fell victim to a [[Nihilist]] plot. While driving on one of the central streets of [[St. Petersburg]], near the [[Winter Palace]], he was mortally wounded by the explosion of hand-made grenades and died a few hours afterwards. [[Nikolai Kibalchich]], [[Sophia Perovskaya]], [[Nikolai Rysakov]], [[Timofei Mikhailov]], and [[Andrei Zhelyabov]] were all arrested and sentenced to death. [[Gesya Gelfman]] was sent to [[Siberia]]. The Tsar was killed by the Pole [[Ignacy Hryniewiecki]] (1856-1881), who died during the attack. Hryniewiecki was a Pole from  (Bobrujsk, now [[Babruysk]], [[Belarus]]). The Russians had instigated a complete ban on the [[Polish language]] in public places, schools, and offices in a process now known as [[Russification]]. This Russification scheme, it is theorized, led to Hryniewiecki's resolve to assassinate Alexander II.

==Principles==
Alexander was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], the second son of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and [[Marie of Hesse and by Rhine]]. In natural disposition he bore little resemblance to his soft-hearted, liberal minded father, and still less to his refined, philosophic, sentimental, chivalrous, yet cunning grand-uncle [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], who coveted the title of &quot;the first gentleman of [[Europe]].&quot; While an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the ballet, he was seen as lacking exquisite refinement and studied elegance. Indeed, he rather gloried in the idea of being of the same rough texture as the great majority of his subjects. His straightforward, abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness, while his direct, unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough-hewn, immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements. His education was not fitted to soften these peculiarities. He is also noted for his immense physical strength.

==Rise to Power==
During the first twenty years of his life he had no prospect of succeeding to the throne, because he had an elder brother, Nicholas, who seemed of a fairly robust constitution. Even when this elder brother showed symptoms of delicate health it was believed that his life might be indefinitely prolonged by proper care and attention, and precautions had been taken for the succession by his betrothal with the beautiful princess [[Dagmar of Denmark]].  Under these circumstances the greatest solicitude was devoted to the education of Nicholas as csarevich, whereas Alexander received only the perfunctory and inadequate training of an ordinary grand-duke of that period, which did not go much beyond and secondary instruction, practical acquaintance with French, English and German, and a certain amount of military drill.

==Education==
When he became heir-apparent by the death of his elder brother in 1865, he began to study the principles of law and administration under [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], who was then a professor of civil law at [[Moscow State University]] and who later (in 1880) became [[chief procurator]] of the [[Holy Synod]]. Pobedonostsev awakened in his pupil very little love for abstract studies or prolonged intellectual exertion, but he influenced the character of Alexander's reign by instilling into the young man's mind the belief that zeal for [[Russian Orthodoxy|Russian Orthodox]] thought was an essential factor of Russian patriotism and was to be specially cultivated by every right-minded tsar.

On his deathbed, his elder brother had expressed a wish that his affianced bride, Princess Dagmar of Denmark, should marry his successor, and this wish was realized on [[November 9]] [[1866]].  The union proved a most happy one and remained unclouded to the end.  During those years when he was heir-apparent&amp;mdash;[[1865]] to [[1881]]&amp;mdash;he did not play a prominent part in public affairs, but he allowed it to become known that he had certain ideas of his own which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government.
==Foreign Relations== [[Image:Paris(Seine).JPG|thumb|275px|Pont Alexandre III in [[Paris]] commemorates the conclusion of the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]].]]
He deprecated what he considered undue foreign influence in general, and German influence in particular, and he longed to see the adoption of genuine national principles in all spheres of official activity, with a view to realizing his ideal of a homogeneous Russia&amp;mdash;homogeneous in language, administration and religion.  With such ideas and aspirations he could hardly remain permanently in cordial agreement with his father, who, though a good patriot according to his lights, had strong German sympathies, often used the German language in his private relations, occasionally ridiculed the exaggerations and eccentricities of the Slavophiles and based his foreign policy on the Prussian alliance.

The antagonism first appeared publicly during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], when the tsar supported the cabinet of [[Berlin]] and the tsarevich did not conceal his sympathies with the French.  It reappeared in an intermittent fashion during the years 1875&amp;ndash;1879, when the Eastern question produced so much excitement in all ranks of Russian society.  At first the tsarevich was more Slavophile than the government, but his [[phlegmatic]] nature preserved him from many of the exaggerations indulged in by others, and any of the prevalent popular illusions he may have imbibed were soon dispelled by personal observation in [[Bulgaria]], where he commanded the left wing of the invading army.

The [[Bulgaria|Bulgarians]] had been represented in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]  and [[Moscow]] not only as martyrs but also as saints, and a very little personal experience sufficed to correct the error.  Like most of his brother officers he could not feel any very great affection for the &quot;little brothers&quot;, as the Bulgarians were then commonly called, and he was constrained to admit that the Turks were by no means so black as they had been painted.  He did not, however, scandalize the believers by any public expression of his opinions, and did not indeed make himself conspicuous in any way during the campaign.  Never consulted on political questions, he confined himself to his military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner.  After many mistakes and disappointments, the army reached [[Constantinople]] and the treaty of San Stefano was signed, but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the congress of [[Berlin]].  Prince [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] failed to do what was confidently expected of him. 

In return for the Russian support, which had enabled him to create the German empire, it was thought that he would help Russia to solve the Eastern question in accordance with her own interests, but to the surprise and indignation of the cabinet of St. Petersburg he confined himself to acting the part of &quot;honest broker&quot; at the congress, and shortly afterwards he ostentatiously contracted an alliance with [[Austria]] for the express purpose of counteracting Russian designs in Eastern Europe.  The tsarevich could point to these results as confirming the views he had expressed during the Franco-Prussian War, and he drew from them the practical conclusion that for Russia the best thing to do was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion and to prepare for future contingencies by a radical scheme of military and naval reorganization.  In accordance with this conviction, he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced.

==Anti-reforms== [[Image:Aleximpressio.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Paolo Troubetzkoy]]'s equestrian monument to Alexander III (1900-06) brilliantly conveys the impression of brutal power that the tsar was said to emanate.]]

During the campaign in Bulgaria he had found by painful experience that grave disorders and gross corruption existed in the military administration, and after his return to St. Petersburg he had discovered that similar abuses existed in the naval department.  For these abuses, several high-placed personages&amp;mdash;among others two of the grand-dukes&amp;mdash;were believed to be responsible, and he called his father's attention to the subject.  His representations were not favourably received.  Alexander II had lost much of the reforming zeal which distinguished the first decade of his reign, and had no longer the energy required to undertake the task suggested to him.  The consequence was that the relations between father and son became more strained.  The latter must have felt that there would be no important reforms until he himself succeeded to the direction of affairs.  That change was much nearer at hand than was commonly supposed.  On the [[13 March]] [[1881]] Alexander II was assassinated by a band of [[Nihilist]]s, [[Narodnaya Volya]] (People's Will),  and the autocratic power passed to the hands of his son. 

In the last years of his reign, Alexander II had been much exercised by the spread of Nihilist doctrines and the increasing number of anarchist conspiracies, and for some time he had hesitated between strengthening the hands of the executive and making concessions to the widespread political aspirations of the educated classes.  Finally he decided in favour of the latter course, and on the very day of his death he signed an ukaz, creating a number of consultative commissions which might have been easily transformed into an assembly of notables.

Following advice of his political mentor [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], Alexander III determined to adopt the opposite policy.  He at once cancelled the ukaz before it was published, and in the manifesto announcing his accession to the throne he let it be very clearly understood that he had no intention of limiting or weakening the autocratic power which he had inherited from his ancestors.  Nor did he afterwards show any inclination to change his mind.

All the internal reforms which he initiated were intended to correct what he considered as the too liberal tendencies of the previous reign, so that he left behind him the reputation of a sovereign of the retrograde type.  In his opinion Russia was to be saved from anarchical disorders and revolutionary agitation, not by the parliamentary institutions and so-called liberalism of western Europe, but by the three principles which the elder generation of the Slavophils systematically recommended&amp;mdash;nationality, Eastern Orthodoxy and autocracy.  His political ideal was a nation containing only one nationality, one language, one religion and one form of administration; and he did his utmost to prepare for the realization of this ideal by imposing the Russian language and Russian schools on his German, Polish and Finnish subjects, by fostering Eastern Orthodoxy at the expense of other confessions, by persecuting the [[Jew]]s and by destroying the remnants of German, Polish and Swedish institutions in the outlying provinces. [[Image:Siberianbarber.jpg|thumb|[[Nikita Mikhalkov]] as Tsar Alexander III in his movie ''The Barber of Siberia'' (1998).]]

In the other provinces he sought to counteract what he considered the excessive liberalism of his father's reign.  For this purpose he removed what little power had by zemstvo, an elective local administration resembling the county and parish councils in [[England]], had and placed the autonomous administration of the peasant communes under the supervision of landed proprietors appointed by the government.  At the same time he sought to strengthen and centralize the imperial administration, and to bring it more under his personal control.

In foreign affairs he was emphatically a man of peace, but not at all a partisan of the doctrine of peace at any price, and he followed the principle that the best means of averting war is to be well prepared for it.  Though indignant at the conduct of Prince Bismarck towards Russia, he avoided an open rupture with Germany, and even revived for a time the Three Emperors' Alliance.

It was only in the last years of his reign, when [[Mikhail Katkov]] had acquired a certain influence over him, that he adopted towards the cabinet of [[Berlin]] a more hostile attitude, and even then he confined himself to keeping a large quantity of troops near the German frontier, and establishing cordial relations with France.  With regard to Bulgaria he exercised similar self-control.  The efforts of Prince Alexander and afterwards of Stamboloff to destroy Russian influence in the principality excited his indignation, but he persistently vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms.

In [[1887]], once again the Peoples Will planned the murder of Tsar Alexander III. Among the conspirators captured were one [[Aleksandr Ulyanov]]. Ulyanov was sentenced to death and hanged on [[May 5]] [[1887]]. Alexander Ulyanov was the brother of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, who would later take the pseudonym [[Vladimir Lenin|V.I. Lenin]].

In [[Central Asia]]n affairs he followed the traditional policy of gradually extending Russian domination without provoking a conflict with the [[United Kingdom]], and he never allowed the bellicose partisans of a forward policy to get out of hand.  As a whole his reign cannot be regarded as one of the eventful periods of Russian history; but it must be admitted that under his hard unsympathetic rule the country made considerable progress.  He died at [[Livadiya]] on the [[November 1|1st of November]] [[1894]] and was buried at the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. Alexander III was succeeded by his eldest son [[Nicholas II of Russia]].

==Children==
Alexander III had six children of his marriage with [[Dagmar of Denmark|Princess Dagmar of Denmark]], later known as Marie Feodorovna:
*[[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nikolai II]] ([[May 6]], [[1868]] - [[July 17]], [[1918]]).
*[[Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich of Russia]] ([[June 7]], [[1869]] - [[May 2]], [[1870]]).
*[[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia]] ([[May 6]], [[1871]] - [[August 9]], [[1899]]).
*[[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia]] ([[April 6]], [[1875]] - [[April 20]], [[1960]]).
*[[Michael II of Russia|Grand Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich of Russia]] ([[November 22]], [[1878]] - c. [[June 12]], [[1918]]).
*[[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia]] ([[June 13]], [[1882]] - [[November 24]], [[1960]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexander I (Alasdair mac Maíl Choluim)''' (c. [[1078]] &amp;ndash; [[April 23]] [[1124]]), called &quot;The Fierce&quot;, king of [[Scotland]], was the fourth son of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm Canmore]] by his wife (St) [[Saint Margaret of Scotland | Margaret]], grand-niece of [[Edward the Confessor]]. He was named in honor of [[Pope Alexander II]].

On the death of his brother [[Edgar I of Scotland|Edgar]] in [[1107]] he succeeded to the Scottish crown; but, in accordance with Edgar's instructions, he inherited only a part of its possessions.  By a partition, the motive of which is not quite certain, the districts south of the Forth and Clyde were erected into an [[earldom]] for Alexander's younger brother, David.

Alexander, dissatisfied, sought to obtain the whole, but without success. A curious combination of the fierce warrior and the pious churchman, he manifested the one aspect of his character in his ruthless suppression of an insurrection on behalf of the descendants of [[Lulach I of Scotland|Lulach]] in his northern dominion (thus gaining for himself the title of &quot;the Fierce&quot;), the other in his munificent foundation of bishoprics and abbeys. Among the latter were those of [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]] and [[Inchcolm]].

In 1107, he married Sybilla, an illegitimate daughter of [[Henry I of England]]. The exact date and the location of the marriage are not recorded. Sybilla died in unrecorded circumstances on the Island of the Woman (''Eilean nam Ban'') on Loch Tay in July, [[1122]]. The marriage produced no children.  

Alexander's strong championing of the independence of the Scottish church involved him in struggles with both of the English metropolitan sees. He died on April 23, 25 or 27, 1124 at his court at Stirling; his brother, [[David I of Scotland | David I]] succeeded him. The historian John of Fordun said of him: ''&quot;[Alexander] was humble and courteous to the clergy, but, to the rest of his subjects, terrible beyond measure.&quot;''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexander II''' ([[August 24]], [[1198]] &amp;ndash; [[July 6]], [[1249]]), king of [[Scotland]], son of [[William I of Scotland|William I]], the Lion, and of [[Ermengarde of Beaumont]], was born at [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]], [[East Lothian]], in [[1198]], and succeeded to the kingdom on the death of his father on [[4 December ]][[1214]].  

The year after his accession the clans MacWilliam and MacHeth, inveterate enemies of the Scottish crown, broke into revolt; but loyalist forces speedily quelled the insurrection. In the same year Alexander joined the English barons in their struggle against [[John I of England]], and led an army into the [[Kingdom of England]] in support of their cause; but after John's death, on the conclusion of peace between his youthful son [[Henry III of England]] and the French prince [[Louis VIII of France]], the Scottish king joined in the pacification.  Diplomacy further strengthened the reconciliation by the marriage of Alexander to Henry's sister [[Joan of England]] on [[June 18]] or [[June 25]], [[1221]].  

The next year marked the subjection of the hitherto semi-independent district of [[Argyll]].  Royal forces crushed a revolt in [[Galloway]] in [[1235]] without difficulty; nor did an invasion attempted soon afterwards by its exiled leaders meet with success.  Soon afterwards a claim for homage from Henry of [[England]] drew forth from Alexander a counter-claim to the northern English counties.  The two kingdoms, however, settled this dispute by a compromise in [[1237]].

Joanna died in March, [[1238]] in Essex, and in the following year, [[1239]], Alexander remarried. His second wife was Mary of Coucy (Marie de Coucy). The marriage took place on [[May 15]] [[1239]], and produced one son, the future [[Alexander III of Scotland | Alexander III]], born in [[1241]]. 

A threat of invasion by Henry in [[1243]] for a time interrupted the friendly relations between the two countries; but the prompt action of Alexander in anticipating his attack, and the disinclination of the English barons for war, compelled him to make peace next year at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].  Alexander now turned his attention to securing the [[Western Isles]], which still owed a nominal allegiance to [[Norway]].  He successively attempted negotiations and purchase, but without success.  Alexander next attempted to dissuade Ewen, the son of Duncan, Lord of Argyll, to sever his allegiance to [[Haakon IV of Norway]].  Ewen rejected these attempts, and Alexander sailed forth to compel him.  

But on the way he suffered a fever at the Isle of [[Kerrera]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]], and died there in [[1249]]. He was buried at [[Melrose Abbey]], [[Roxburghshire]].
His son [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] succeeded him as King of Scots.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:KraljAlexObrenovic.jpg|thumb|right|King Aleksandar Obrenović]]

'''Aleksandar Obrenović''' or Александар Обреновић ([[August 14]], [[1876]] - [[June 11]], [[1903]]), was king of [[Serbia]] from [[1889]] to [[1903]].

In [[1889]] his father, [[Milan Obrenovic IV|King Milan]], abdicated and proclaimed Aleksandar king of Serbia under a regency until he should attain his majority at eighteen years of age.

In [[1893]], King Aleksandar, being then in his seventeenth year, made his notable first ''[[coup d'état]]'', proclaimed himself of full age, dismissed the [[regency|regents]] and their government, and took the royal authority into his own hands. His action was popular, and was rendered still more so by his appointment of a radical ministry. 

In May [[1894]] King Aleksandar, by another ''[[coup d'état]]'', abolished the liberal constitution of [[1889]] and restored the conservative one of [[1869]].  His attitude during the Turco-Greek war of [[1897]] was one of strict neutrality. In [[1898]] he appointed his father commander-in-chief of the Serbian army, and from that time, or rather from his return to Serbia in 1894 until [[1900]], [[Milan Obrenovic IV|ex-king Milan]] was regarded as the ''de facto'' ruler of the country.

During the summer of [[1900]], [[Milan Obrenovic IV|Milan]] was away from [[Serbia]] on holiday in [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]] and making arrangements to secure the hand of a [[Germany|German]] princess for his son, and while the premier, Dr. Vladan Dyorević, was visiting the [[Paris]] [[World Exhibition|Universal Exhibition]], King Aleksandar suddenly announced to the people of Serbia his engagement to the widow Madame [[Draga Mašin]], formerly a lady-in-waiting to [[Natalija Obrenovic|Queen Natalie]]. The projected union initially aroused great opposition. [[Milan Obrenovic IV|Ex-King Milan]] resigned his post, as did the government; and King Aleksandar had great difficulty in forming a new cabinet. Opposition to the union subsided somewhat on the publication of [[Tsar Nicholas]]'s congratulations to the king on his engagement and of his acceptance to act as the principal witness at the wedding. The marriage was duly celebrated in August [[1900]]. Even so, the unpopularity of the union weakened the King's position in the eyes of the army and the country at large.

King Aleksandar tried to reconcile political parties by unveiling a [[classical liberalism|liberal]] [[constitution]] of his own initiative, introducing for the first time in the constitutional history of Serbia the system of two chambers (''[[Assembly|skupshtina]]'' and ''[[senate]]'').  This reconciled the political parties but did not reconcile the army which, already dissatisfied with the king's marriage, became still more so at the rumors that one of the two unpopular brothers of [[Queen Draga]], Lieutenant Nicodiye, was to be proclaimed heir-apparent to the throne.

Meanwhile, the independence of the [[senate]] and of the council of state caused increasing irritation to King Aleksandar. In yet another ''[[coup d'état]]'', he suspended (March [[1903]]) the [[constitution]] for half an hour, time enough to publish the decrees by which the old senators and councillors of state were dismissed and replaced by new ones. This arbitrary act naturally increased the dissatisfaction in the country. The general impression was that as much as the [[senate]] was packed with men devoted to the royal couple and the government obtained a large majority at the general elections, King Aleksandar would not hesitate any longer to proclaim Queen Draga's brother as the [[heir]] to the throne.  

Apparently to prevent this, but in reality to replace Aleksandar Obrenović with [[Peter I of Serbia|Petar Karađorđević I]], a military conspiracy by [[Black Hand]] was organized. Their palace was invaded and the Royal couple hid in a cupboard in the Queen's bedroom. The conspirators searched the palace and eventually discovered the royal couple and savagely murdered them in the early morning of [[June 11]], [[1903]]. King Aleksandar and Queen Draga were shot and their bodies mutilated and thrown from a window in the palace.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Alexander III.jpg|right]]'''Alexander III''' ([[September 4]], [[1241]] &amp;ndash; [[March 19]], [[1286]]), [[King of Scots]], also known as '''Alexander the Glorious''', ranks as one of [[Scotland|Scotland's]] greatest kings.

Born at [[Roxburgh]], [[Scottish Borders|Borders]], as the son of [[Alexander II of Scotland]] by his second wife Marie de Coucy, he became king at the age of eight when his  father died ([[6 July]] [[1249]]). His coronation took place on [[July 13]], [[1249]] at [[Scone Abbey]], [[Perthshire]].

The years of his minority featured an embittered struggle for the control of affairs between two rival parties, the one led by [[Walter Comyn]], [[Earl of Menteith]], the other by Alan Durward, the [[justiciar]].  The former dominated  the early years of Alexander's reign.  At the marriage of Alexander to Margaret of [[England]] in [[1251]], [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] seized the opportunity to demand from his son-in-law homage for the Scottish kingdom, but Alexander did not comply.  In [[1255]] an interview between the English and Scottish kings at [[Kelso]] led to Menteith and his party losing to Durward's party. But though disgraced, they still retained great influence, and two years later, seizing the person of the king, they compelled their rivals to consent to the erection of a regency representative of both parties.

On attaining his majority at the age of 21 in [[1262]], Alexander declared his intention of resuming the projects on the [[Western Isles]] which the death of his father thirteen years before had cut short. He laid a formal claim before the [[Norway|Norwegian]] king [[Haakon IV of Norway | Haakon]].  Haakon rejected the claim, and in the following year  responded with a formidable invasion.  Sailing round the west coast of Scotland he halted off the [[Isle of Arran]], and negotiations commenced. Alexander artfully prolonged the talks until the autumn storms should begin.  At length Haakon, weary of delay, attacked, only to encounter a terrific [[extreme weather|storm]] which greatly damaged his ships.  The [[battle of Largs]] (October 1263) proved indecisive, but even so, Haakon's position was hopeless.  Baffled, he turned homewards, but died on the way on the Orkneys (15 December 1263). The Isles now lay at Alexander's feet, and in [[1266]] Haakon's successor concluded the [[1266 Treaty of Perth|Treaty of Perth]] by which he ceded the [[Isle of Man]] and the Western Isles to Scotland in return for a money payment. Norway retained only [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] in the area.

Alexander had married Princess Margaret of England, a daughter of King [[Henry III of England]] and [[Eleanor of Provence]], on [[December 26]], [[1251]]. She died in [[1274]], having given him three children:
# Margaret ([[February 28]], [[1260]]-[[April 9]], [[1283]]), married King [[Eirik II of Norway]]
# Alexander ([[January 21]], [[1263]]-[[January 28]], [[1283]])
# David ([[March 20]], [[1272]]-June [[1281]])

According to the chronicle of [[Lanercost]], Alexander did not spend his decade as a widower alone: &quot;''he used never to forbear on account of season nor storm, nor for perils of flood or rocky cliffs, but would visit none too creditably nuns or matrons, virgins or widows as the fancy seized him, sometimes in disguise''.&quot;

Towards the end of Alexander's reign, the death of all three of his children within a few years made the question of the succession one of pressing importance. In [[1284]] he induced the [[Scottish Parliament | Estates]] to recognize as his heir-presumptive his granddaughter [[Margaret I of Scotland | Margaret, the &quot;Maid of Norway&quot;]]. The need for a male heir led him to contract a second marriage to Yolande de [[Dreux]] on [[November 1]], [[1285]]. 

But the sudden death of the king dashed all such hopes. Alexander died in a fall from his horse in the dark while riding to visit the queen at [[Kinghorn]] in [[Fife]] on [[March 16|16th]] or [[March 19|19th]] of March [[1286]]. His death ushered in a time of political upheaval for Scotland.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexander of Aphrodisias''', pupil of [[Aristocles of Messene]], the most celebrated of the Greek commentators on the writings of [[Aristotle]], and styled, by way of pre-eminence, ''o exegetes'' (&quot;the expositor&quot;), was a native of [[Aphrodisias]] in [[Caria]].

He came to [[Athens]] towards the end of the [[2nd century]] AD, became head of the [[Lyceum]] and lectured on [[peripatetic]] [[philosophy]].
The object of his work was to free the doctrine from the [[syncretism]] of [[Ammonius Saccas|Ammonius]] and to reproduce the pure doctrine of Aristotle.

Commentaries by Alexander on the following works of Aristotle are still extant:
*the ''Analytica Priora'', i
*the ''Topica''
*the ''Meteorologica''
*the ''De Sensu''
*the ''Metaphysica'', i-v, together with an abridgment of what he wrote on the remaining books of the ''Metaphysica''.

His commentaries were greatly esteemed among the [[Arab]]ians, who translated many of them.

[[Alexander's band]], an [[optical phenomenon]], is named after him.

There are also several original writings by Alexander still extant.
The most important of these are a work ''On Fate'', in which he argues against the [[Stoic]] doctrine of necessity; and one ''On the Soul'', in which he contends that the undeveloped reason in man is material (''nous ulikos'') and inseparable from the body.
He argued strongly against the doctrine of [[immortality]].
He identified the active intellect (''nous poietikos''), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, with God.

Several of Alexander's works were published in the Aldine edition of Aristotle, Venice, 1495-1498; his ''De Fato'' and ''De Anima'' were printed along with the works of [[Themistius]] at Venice (1534); the former work, which has been translated into [[Latin]] by [[Grotius]] and also 
by [[Schulthess]], was edited by [[J. C. Orelli]], [[Zurich]], [[1824]]; and his commentaries on the Metaphysica by [[H. Bonitz]], [[Berlin]], [[1847]].  [[J. Nourisson]] has treated of his doctrine of fate (''De la liberte et du hazard'', [[Paris]], 1870).
In the early [[Renaissance]] his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] against the [[Thomists]] and the [[Averroists]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Alexander_severus.jpg|right|thumb|Alexander Severus]]
'''Marcus Aurelius Severus Alexandrus''' ([[October 1]], [[208]]- [[March 18]], [[235]]), commonly called '''Alexander Severus''', [[Roman Emperors|Roman emperor]] from [[222]] to [[235]], was born at [[Arqa|Arca Caesarea]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

His father, [[Gessius Marcianus]], held office more than once as an imperial procurator; his mother, [[Julia Mamaea]], was the daughter of [[Julia Maesa]] and the aunt of [[Elagabalus]] (also called &quot;Heliogabalus&quot;).  His original name was Bassianus, but he changed it in 221 when his grandmother, Maesa, persuaded the emperor Elagabalus to adopt his cousin as successor and create him Caesar.  In the next year, on [[March 11]], Elagabalus was murdered, and Alexander was proclaimed emperor by the [[Praetorian Guard|Praetorians]] and accepted by the senate.

He was then a mere lad, amiable, well-meaning, but entirely under the dominion of his mother, a woman of many virtues, who surrounded him with wise counsellors, watched over the development of his character and improved the tone of the administration, but on the other hand was inordinately jealous, and alienated the army by extreme parsimony, while neither she nor her son had a strong enough hand to keep tight the reins of military discipline. Mutinies became frequent in all parts of the empire; to one of them the life of the jurist and praetorian praefect [[Ulpian]] was sacrificed; another compelled the retirement of [[Dio Cassius]] from his command.

On the whole, however, the reign of Alexander was prosperous till he was summoned to the East to face the new power of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanians]]. Of the war that followed we have very various accounts; [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] leans to that which is least favourable to the Romans.  According to Alexander's own dispatch to the senate he gained great victories.  At all events, though the [[Persians]] were checked for the time, the conduct of the Roman army showed an extraordinary lack of discipline.  The emperor returned to [[Rome]] and celebrated a triumph ([[233]]), but next year he was called to face German invaders in [[Gaul]], not far from Mainz, where he was slain, (on either [[March 18|18]] or [[March 19|19]] March  [[235]]), together with his mother, in a mutiny of the [[Legio XXII Primigenia|Legio XXII ''Primigenia'']] which was probably led by [[Maximinus Thrax]], a Thracian legionary, and at any rate secured him the throne.


[[Image:Bronze-Alexander Severus-Deultum AE25 Moushmov 3583.jpg|thumb|300px|Alexander Severus coin, celebrating [[Artemis]] and the ''Flavian colony of [[Burgas|Deultum]]''.]]
Alexander was the last of the Syrian emperors. Under the influence of his mother, he did much to improve the morals and condition of the people.  His advisers were men like the famous jurist Ulpian, the historian Dio Cassius and a select board of sixteen senators; a municipal council of fourteen assisted the urban praefect in administering the affairs of the fourteen districts of Rome. The luxury and extravagance that had formerly been so prevalent at the court were put down; the standard of the coinage was raised; taxes were lightened; literature, art and science were encouraged; the lot of the soldiers was improved; and, for the convenience of the people, loan offices were instituted for lending money at a moderate rate of interest.

In religious matters Alexander preserved an open mind. In his private chapel he had busts of [[Orpheus]], [[Abraham]], [[Apollonius of Tyana]], and [[Jesus]]. It is said that he was desirous of erecting a temple to the founder of Christianity, but was dissuaded by the pagan priests.  There is no doubt that, had Alexander's many excellent qualities been supported by the energy and strength of will necessary for the government of a military empire, he would have been one of the greatest of the Roman emperors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexander''' is a common male first name.  It also occurs, less frequently, as a [[family name|surname]].

==Origin==
The name in [[English language|English]] is taken from the [[Latin]] &quot;Alexander,&quot; which is a Romanization of the original [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[nominative]] ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΣ (''Alexandros''). The [[genitive]] form in Greek is ''Alexandrou''. 

[[Etymology|Etymologically]], the name derives from ''alex-'', the compound-form of ''alexis'' (from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [PIE] ''*alek-''), meaning &quot;refuge, protection, defence,&quot; together with ''-andros'', the compound form of andēr (from the PIE ''*ner-''), meaning &quot;man.&quot;  Thus is may be roughly translated as &quot;protector of men.&quot;  The term is either a rare type of &quot;inverse [[tatpurusha]]&quot; compound, with the modifier in second position (the cognate [[Sanskrit]] tatpurusha being *nararakṣa, cf. [[Ramayana]] 6.33.45; the exact Sanskrit counterpart would be *rakṣinara, from PIE hleks(i)-hnros), or a worn-down [[terpsimbrotos]] type compound, whose original verbal meaning was &quot;he protects men&quot;.

The earliest reference to the name may be that to [[Alaksandu]] in the [[13th century BC]].

The name was one of the titles (&quot;epithets&quot;) given to the Greek goddess [[Hera]] and as such is usually taken to mean &quot;one who comes to the aid of warriors.&quot;  In the [[Iliad]], the character [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] is known also as Alexander.  The name's popularity was spread throughout the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic world]] by the military conquests of King Alexander III of Macedon, commonly known as '''[[Alexander the Great]]''' (''Μέγας Αλέξανδρος'').

==Variants==
The female version of the name is Alexandra. Clipped forms derived from the name include: Alexandros/Alexandra, Alexis/Alexia, Alekos/Aleka (Greece), Alec, Alle, Alecu (Romania), Alex, Allie, Lex, Sander, Sandra (Female only), Sandro (Italy), Sandu (Romania), Sandy, (also female) Sanya (Slavic), Sascha (German, common in Austria), Sasha (Russian affectionate form), Shura (also in Russia), Xan, Xander, Xandi, Alexandre(french), Alejandro (spanish).

The surname bears various forms depending on the country. In all but a few cases, these forms directly correspond with the form of the first name used in that country. For example, the English version is generally spelled Alexander, the Italian version of the surname is spelled Alessandro, and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexander Aetolus''', of [[Pleuron]] in [[Aetolia]], Greek poet and man of letters, the only representative of Aetolian poetry, flourished about [[280 BC]].

When living in [[Alexandria]] he was commissioned by [[Ptolemy Philadelphus]] to arrange the tragedies and satyric dramas in the library; some ten years later he took up his residence at the court of [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonus Gonatas]], king of [[Macedon]]ia.

His reputation as a tragic poet was so high that he was allotted a place in the [[Alexandrian Pleiad|Alexandrian tragic ''Pleiad'']]; we only know the title of one play (''Astragalistae.'') He also wrote short epics, epigrams and elegies, the considerable fragments of which show learning and eloquence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AlexanderJannaeus.gif|thumb|300px|Coin of '''Alexander Jannaeus''' (103-76 BC).
&lt;br&gt;'''Front:''' [[Seleucid]] anchor, with Greek legend &quot;King Alexander&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;'''Back:''' Eight-spoked wheel or star-within a diadem, with Hebrew letters between the spokes &quot;Yehonatan the King&quot;.]]

'''Alexander Jannaeus''' (also known as '''Alexander Jannai/Yannai'''), king of [[Judea]] from ([[103 BCE]] to [[76 BCE]]), son of [[John Hyrcanus]], inherited the throne from his brother [[Aristobulus]], and appears to have married his brother's widow, ''Shlamtzion'' or ''Shlomtzion'' or &quot;Shelomit&quot;, also known as [[Salome Alexandra]], according to the Biblical law of Yibum (&quot;levirate marriage&quot;), although [[Josephus]] is inexplicit on that point.

His likely full Hebrew name was Jonathan; he may have been the High Priest Jonathan, rather than his great-uncle of the same name, who established the [[Masada]] fortress.  Under the name King Yannai, he appears as a wicked tyrant in the [[Talmud]], reflecting his conflict with the [[Pharisee]] party. He is among the more colorful historical figures little known, however, outside specialized history, although the impact of him and his widow on the subsequent development of Judaism and Christianity is substantial. 

==Civil war against the Pharisees==
[[Image:WillemSwiddeAlexanderJannaeus.jpg|thumb|300px|The excution of the Pharisees by Alexander Jannaeus, showing the King and his Court feasting during the executions. Engraving by Willem Swidde, 17th century.]]
An avid supporter of the aristocratic [[Hellenism|Hellenist]] faction known as the [[Sadducees]], his reign was constantly challenged by opponents, among them a brother with a rival claim to the throne, and the populist urban-based [[Pharisee]] party. 

At the beginning of his reign Alexander Jannaeus halted the suppression of the Pharisees and the Sages for a while, under the influence of his wife Salome Alexandra (said to be the sister of the great Jewish sage Shimon ben Shetach). This gave him time and resources to increase his power and prestige by extending the territory under his rule through war and conquest. As his power grew, however, he enlisted foreign soldiers to suppress his own people and eliminate the Pharisees.

One year during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, Alexander Jannaeus, while officiating as the High Priest (Kohen Gadol) at the Temple in Jerusalem, demonstrated his support of the Sadducees by denying the law of the water libation. The crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting Alexander with the etrogim (citrons) that they were holding in their hands. Unwittingly, the crowd had played right into Alexander's hands. He had intended to incite the people to riot and his soldiers fell upon the crowd at his command. The soldiers slew more than 6,000 people in the Temple courtyard.

A civil war started, in which the Pharisees allied with the [[Seleucids]] king [[Demetrius III Eucaerus|Demetrius III]] against Alexander Jannaeus. He first retreated, but then managed to oust his rivals thanks to popular support against the Seleucid invasion of Judea. During the civil war, Alexander Jannaeus suppressed his rivals brutally, killing his brother and many leading Pharisees. ''The New Century Book of Facts'' writes:

:''&quot;It is said that 50,000 perished in this civil strife. He quelled a revolt at Jerusalem by slaughtering 6,000. On his return from a short exile into which he had been driven by the Pharisees, he caused 800 rebels to be crucified before him and their wives and children slaughtered ([[86 BC|86 B.C.]]).&quot;''

==Alliance with the Essenes==
[[Image:JonathanQumran.gif|thumb|150px|[[Dead Sea scrolls|Dead Sea Scroll]] from Qumran, with a prayer to Alexander Jannaeus.]]
Alexander Jannaeus may have been in close relation with the monastic [[Essenes]] at some point, who were probably allies during his fight against the Pharisees. A piece from the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] from [[Qumran]] appears to be an homage to him:

:''&quot;holy city/ for king Jonathan/ and all the congregation of your people/ Israel/ who are in the four/ winds of heaven/ peace be (for) all/ and upon your kingdom/ your name be blessed&quot;'' (Transcription and translation by E. Eshel, H. Eshel, and A. Yardeni)  
  
Alexander Jannaeus showed considerable competence as a military leader, repelling invaders and expanding the country's borders to the west and south.  He was defeated by [[Ptolemy Lathyrus]] in [[Galilee]]; made an alliance with [[Cleopatra]] and drove Ptolemy out.  By the end of his rule, the borders of his state would exceed that of David and extend to Gaza and far into Jordan.  

Upon his death, he was succeeded as monarch by his wife [[Salome Alexandra]], known also and better as [[Shlomzion]], and succeeded as [[High Priest]] by his son John [[Hyrcanus II]].

==Coinage==
The coinage of Alexander Jannaeus is characteristic of the early Jewish coinage in that it avoided human or animal representations, in opposition to the surrounding Greek, and later Roman types of the period. Jewish coinage instead focused on symbols, either natural, such as the [[palm tree]], the [[pomegranate]] or the star, either man-made, such as the temple, the [[Menorah]], trumpets or [[cornucopia]].

[[Image:JanaeusCoinPhoto.JPG|thumb|300px|Coin of Alexander Jannaeus ([[103 BC]] to [[76 BC]]).&lt;br&gt;
'''Obv:''' [[Seleucid]] anchor and Greek Legend: BASILEWS ALEXANDROU &quot;King Alexander&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
'''Rev:''' Eight-spoke wheel or star within diadem. Hebrew legend inside the spokes: &quot;Yehonatan the King&quot;.]]
Alexander Jannaeus was the first of the Jewish kings to introduce the &quot;eight-ray star&quot; or &quot;eight-spoked wheel&quot; symbol, in his [[bronze]] &quot;Widow's mite&quot; coins, in combination with the wide-spread [[Seleucid]] numismatic symbol of the anchor. These coins are thought to be the ones referred to in the [[Bible]] in Luke 21:1-4:
:''&quot;and Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury; and many that were rich cast in much. And He called unto him His disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had&quot;''

Depending on the make, the star symbol can be shown with straight spokes connected to the outside circle, in a style rather indicative of a wheel. On others, the spokes can have a more &quot;flame-like&quot; shape, more indicative of the representation of a star within a diadem.

It is not clear what the wheel or star may exactly symbolize, and interpretations vary, from the morning star, to the sun or the heavens. The influence of some [[Persians|Persian]] symbols of a star within a diadem, or the eight-spoked [[Buddhist]] wheel have also been suggested. The star cannot be a representation of the star of the birth of [[Jesus]], due to the anteriority of the coins by close to a century. On balance, the eight-spoked Macedonian star (a variation of which is the [[Vergina Sun]]), emblem of the royal [[Argead dynasty]] and the ancient kingdom of [[Macedon|Macedonia]], within a Hellenistic [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadem]] symbolizing royalty (many of the coins depict a small knot with two ends on top of the diadem), seem to be the most probable source for this symbol.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Alexandrists''' were a school of [[Renaissance]] philosophers who, in the great controversy on the subject 
of personal immortality, adopted the explanation of the ''De Anima'' given by Alexander of Aphrodisias.

According to the orthodox [[Thomism]] of the Roman Catholic Church, [[Aristotle]] rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul. Against this, the Averroists, led by [[Agostino Nito]],  introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again.  These two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality, or the absorption of the individual into the eternal One.

The Alexandrists, led by Pietro Pomponazzi, boldly assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to Aristotle.  They held that Aristotle considered the soul as a material and therefore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason.  Hence the Alexandrists denied the possibility of any form of immortality, holding that, since the soul is organically connected with the body, the dissolution of the latter involves the extinction of the former.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:Alexius I.jpg|thumb|Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus]]
'''Alexius I''' (Greek: Αλέξιος Α' Κομνηνός or Alexios I Komnenos) ([[1048]] &amp;ndash; [[August 15]], [[1118]]), [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[List of Byzantine Emperors|emperor]] ([[1081]]&amp;ndash;[[1118]]), was the third son of John Comnenus, the nephew of [[Isaac I Comnenus]] (emperor 1057&amp;ndash;1059).  

His father declined the throne on the abdication of Isaac, who was accordingly succeeded by four emperors of other families between [[1059]] and [[1081]].  Under one of these emperors, [[Romanus IV|Romanus IV Diogenes]] ([[1067]]&amp;ndash;[[1071]]), he served with distinction against the [[Seljuk Turks]].  Under [[Michael VII]] Parapinaces ([[1071]]&amp;ndash;[[1078]]) and [[Nicephorus III]] Botaniates ([[1078]]&amp;ndash;[[1081]]) he was also employed, along with his elder brother Isaac, against rebels in [[Asia Minor]], [[Thrace]] and in [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] in [[1071]].  

The success of the [[Comnenus|Comneni]] roused the jealousy of Botaniates and his ministers, and the Comneni were almost compelled to take up arms in self-defence.  Botaniates was forced to abdicate and retire to a [[monastery]], and Isaac declined the crown in favour of his younger brother Alexius, who then became emperor at the age of 33.  

By that time Alexius was the lover of the Empress [[Maria Bagrationi]], a daughter of [[monarch|king]] [[Bagrat IV of Georgia]] who was successively married to [[Michael VII]] Ducas and his successor Botaniates, and was renowned for her beauty.  Alexius and Maria lived almost openly together at the Palace of Mangana, and Alexius had [[Michael VII]] and Maria's young son, the prince Constantine Ducas, adopted and proclaimed heir to the throne.  The affair conferred to Alexius a degree of dynastic legitimacy, but soon his mother Anna Dalassena consolidated the Ducas family connection by arranging the Emperor's wedding with [[Irene Ducaena]] or Doukaina, granddaughter of the ''caesar'' John Ducas, head of a powerful feudal family and the &quot;kingmaker&quot; behind [[Michael VII]].

Alexius' involvement with Maria continued and shortly after his daughter [[Anna Comnena]] was born, she was betrothed to [[Constantine Ducas]] and moved to live at the Mangana Palace with him and Maria.  The situation however changed drastically when [[John II Comnenus]] was born:  Anna's engagement to Constantine was dissolved, she was moved to the main Palace to live with her mother and grandmother, Constantine's status as heir was terminated and Alexius became estranged with Maria, now stripped of her imperial title.  Shortly afterwards, the teenager Constantine died and Maria was confined to a convent.

[[Image:Histamenon nomisma-Alexius I-sb1776.jpg|thumb|300px|This coin was struck by Alexius during his war against [[Robert Guiscard]].]]
Alexius' long reign of nearly 37 years was full of struggle. At the very outset he had to meet the formidable attack of the [[Normans]] ([[Robert Guiscard]] and his son [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemund]]), who took [[Durrës|Dyrrhachium]] and [[Corfu]], and laid siege to [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]] (see [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]]).  The Norman danger ended for the time with Robert Guiscard's death in [[1085]], and the conquests were reversed.  

He had next to repel the invasions of [[Pechenegs]] and [[Kypchaks|Cumans]] in Thrace, with whom the [[Manichaean]] sect of the [[Bogomils]] made common cause; and thirdly, he had to cope with the fast-growing power of the [[Seljuk Turks]] in Asia Minor.  

Above all he had to meet the difficulties caused by the arrival of the [[knight]]s of the [[First Crusade]], which had been, to a great degree, initiated as the result of the representations of his own ambassadors, whom he had sent to [[Pope Urban II]] at the [[Council of Piacenza]] in [[1095]]. The help which he wanted from the West was simply [[mercenary]] forces and not the immense hosts which arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment.  The first group, under [[Peter the Hermit]], he dealt with by sending them on to Asia Minor, where they were massacred by the Turks in [[1096]].  

The second and much more serious host of knights, led by [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], he also led into Asia, promising to supply them with provisions in return for an oath of homage, and by their victories recovered for the Byzantine Empire a number of important cities and islands&amp;mdash;[[Nicaea]], [[Chios]], [[Rhodes]], [[Izmir|Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Philadelphia (Alasehir)|Philadelphia]], [[Sardis]], and in fact most of Asia Minor ([[1097]]&amp;ndash;[[1099]]).  This is ascribed by his daughter [[Anna Comnena|Anna]] as a credit to his policy and diplomacy, but by the Latin historians of the crusade as a sign of his treachery and falseness. The crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when Alexius did not help them during the [[siege of Antioch]]; Bohemund, who had set himself up as [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]], briefly went to war with Alexius, but agreed to become Alexius' vassal under the [[Treaty of Devol]] in [[1108]].

During the last twenty years of his life he lost much of his popularity.  The years were marked by persecution of the followers of the Paulician and Bogomil heresies&amp;mdash;one of his last acts was to burn [[Basil the Physician|Basil]], a Bogomil leader, with whom he had engaged in a theological controversy; by renewed struggles with the Turks ([[1110]]&amp;ndash;[[1117]]); and by anxieties as to the succession, which his wife Irene wished to alter in favour of her daughter Anna's husband, [[Nicephorus Bryennius]], for whose benefit the special title ''[[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|panhypersebastos]]'' (&quot;honored above all&quot;) was created.  This intrigue disturbed even his dying hours.  

Alexius was for many years under the strong influence of an ''eminence grise'', his mother [[Anna Dalassena]], a wise and immensely able politician whom, in a uniquely irregular fashion, he had crowned as ''Empress Augusta'' instead of the rightful claimant to the title, his wife Irene.  Dalassena was the effective administrator of the Empire during Alexius' long absences in war campaigns: she was constantly at odds with her daughter-in-law and had assumed total responsibility for the upbringing and education of her granddaughter [[Anna Comnena]].

'''Alexis''' (ca. [[375 BC]]-ca. [[275 BC]]) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[comedian|comic]] [[poet]] of the [[Middle Comedy]], born at [[Thurii]] and taken early to [[Athens]], where he became a citizen.

He won his first [[Lenaean]] victory in the [[350s BC]], most likely, where he was sixth after [[Eubulus]], and fourth after [[Antiphanes]].

[[Plutarch]] says that he lived to the age of 106, and that he died on the stage while being crowned. According to the ''[[Suda]]'', he wrote 245 comedies, of which some 130 titles are preserved. Only fragments of any of the plays have survived - about 340 in all, totalling about 1,000 lines. They attest to the wit and refinement of the author (see [[Theodor Kock]], ''Comicorum Atticorum Fragmenta'').

The ''Suda'' also calls him [[Menander]]'s uncle, but an anonymous [[tractate]] on comedy more plausibly states that Menander was his pupil. Alexis was known in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times; [[Aulus Gellius]] noted that Alexis' plays were used by Roman comedians, including [[Turpilius]] and possibly [[Plautus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexius II Comnenus''' ([[September 10]], [[1169]] &amp;ndash; October [[1183]]), [[Byzantine emperor]] ([[1180]]-[[1183]]), was the son of emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus]] and [[Maria of Antioch|Maria]], daughter of [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymund]], [[Principality of Antioch|prince of Antioch]]. He was the long-awaited male heir, and was named Alexius as a fulfilment of the [[AIMA prophecy]].

On Manuel's death in [[1180]], Maria, who had been immured in a [[convent]] under the name of Xene, had herself proclaimed regent (1179-1180), and handing over her son to counsellors, who encouraged him in every vice, supported the government of Alexius the ''[[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|protosebastos]]'' (a cousin of Alexius II), who was popularly believed to be Maria's lover.  The young Alexius and his friends now tried to form a party against the empress mother and the protosebastos; and his sister Maria, wife of Caesar John ([[Renier of Montferrat]]), stirred up riots in the streets of the capital.  

Their party was defeated ([[May 2]], [[1182]]), but [[Andronicus I Comnenus|Andronicus Comnenus]] took advantage of these disorders to aim at the crown, entered Constantinople, where he was received with almost divine honours, and overthrew the regents.  His arrival was celebrated by a massacre of the Latins in Constantinople, especially the [[Venice|Venetian]] merchants, which he made no attempt to stop.  He allowed Alexius to be crowned, but forced him to consent to the death of all his friends, including his mother, his sister and the Caesar, and refused to allow him the smallest voice in public affairs.  

The betrothal in 1180 of Alexius with [[Agnes of France]] , daughter of [[Louis VII of France]] and his third wife [[Adèle of Champagne]] and at the time a child of nine, was quashed. Andronicus was now formally proclaimed as co-emperor, and not long afterwards, on the pretext that divided rule was injurious to the Empire, he caused Alexius to be strangled with a bow-string (October 1183).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexius III Angelus''' (Greek: Αλέξιος Γ' Άγγελος or Alexios III Angelos), [[Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperor]], was the second son of Andronicus Angelus, nephew of [[Alexius I]].

In [[1195]], while his brother [[Isaac II]] was away hunting in [[Thrace]], he was proclaimed emperor by the troops; he captured Isaac at [[Stagira]] in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], put out his eyes, and kept him henceforth a close prisoner, though he had been redeemed by him from captivity at [[Antioch]] and loaded with honours.

To compensate for this crime and to confirm his position as emperor, he had to scatter money so lavishly as to empty his treasury, and to allow such licence to the officers of the army as to leave the Empire practically defenceless. He consummated the financial ruin of the state. The able and forceful empress [[Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamaterina]] tried in vain to sustain his credit and his court; Vatatzes, the favourite instrument of her attempts at reform, was [[assassination|assassinated]] by the emperor's orders.

Eastward the Empire was overrun by the [[Seljuk Turks]]; from the north [[Bulgarians]] and [[Vlachs]] descended unchecked to ravage the plains of Macedonia and Thrace; while Alexius squandered the public treasure on his palaces and gardens. Soon he was threatened by a new and yet more formidable danger. In [[1202]] the Western princes of the [[Fourth Crusade]] assembled at [[Venice]], bent on a new [[crusade]].  Alexius, son of the deposed Isaac, escaped from [[Constantinople]] and appealed to the crusaders, promising as a crowning bribe to heal the [[East-West Schism|schism]] of [[Eastern Orthodoxy|East]] and [[Roman Catholicism|West]] if they would help him to depose his uncle.

The crusaders, whose objective had been [[Egypt]], were persuaded to set their course for Constantinople, before which they appeared in June [[1203]], proclaiming Alexius as emperor [[Alexius IV]] and summoning the capital to depose his uncle. Alexius III, sunk in debauchery, took no efficient measures to resist. His son-in-law, [[Theodore I Lascaris|Lascaris]], who was the only one to do anything, was defeated at [[Scutari]], and the siege of [[Constantinople]] began. On the [[July 17]] the crusaders, the aged [[Doge of Venice|doge]] [[Enrico Dandolo]] at their head, scaled the walls and took the city by storm. During the fighting and carnage that followed Alexius hid in the palace, and finally, with one of his daughters, Irene, and such treasures as he could collect, got into a boat and escaped to [[Develton]] in Thrace, leaving his wife, his other daughters and his Empire to the victors.  Isaac, drawn from his prison and robed once more in the imperial purple, received his son in state.

Shortly afterwards Alexius made an effort in conjunction with Murtzuphlos ([[Alexius V]]) to recover the throne. The attempt was unsuccessful and, after wandering about [[Greece]], he surrendered with Euphrosyne, who had meanwhile joined him, to [[Boniface of Montferrat]], then master of a great part of the [[Balkan peninsula]] (the so-called [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]]). Leaving his protection he sought shelter with [[Michael I Ducas]], [[Despotate of Epirus|despot of Epirus]], and then repaired to [[Asia Minor]], where his son-in-law Lascaris was holding his own against the Latins.

Alexius, joined by [[Kay Khusrau I]], the [[sultan]] of [[Sultanate of Rüm|Rüm]] (also called the sultan of [[Iconium]] or [[Konya]]), now demanded the crown of Lascaris, and on his refusal marched against him.  Lascaris, however, defeated and took him prisoner.  Alexius was relegated to a [[monastery]] at [[Nicaea]], where he died on some date unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexius V Ducas Murtzouphlos''' (d. [[1205]]), [[Byzantine emperor]], was proclaimed emperor on [[February 5]], [[1204]], during the siege of [[Constantinople]] by the Latins ([[Fourth Crusade]]).  His nickname &quot;Murtzouphlos&quot; referred to his extremely bushy eyebrows. He was related to the imperial Angelus family. 

A Byzantine nobleman, he had risen to the court position of protovestarius by the time of the [[4th Crusade]]. By January of [[1204]], the Emperors [[Isaac II]] and [[Alexius IV]] had inspired little confidence among the people of Constantinople in their efforts to defend the city from the Latins. As a result of his position, Alexius Ducas had easy access to the Imperial residence, and when a revolution in the city arose with the intent of toppling the two Angeli Emperors, Alexius used that access to capture them. The young [[Alexius IV]] would be killed by the bowstring. The death of his father, [[Isaac II]], shortly afterward, was possibly &quot;artificially induced.&quot; 

Upon his coronation, Alexius V began to strengthen the defenses of [[Constantinople]] and ended negotiations with the Latins. It was too late, however, for the new Emperor to make much of a difference. During the ensuing fight, he defended the city with courage and tenacity. The crusaders would prove to be too strong, and Alexius fled to Thrace shortly before the city fell.

He later attempted to ally with his fellow ex-emperor [[Alexius III]] against the Latins, but Alexius III had him blinded and delivered into the hands of the crusaders, who put him to death by casting him from the top of the Pillar of Theodosius as the murderer of Alexius IV. He was the last Byzantine emperor before the establishment of the [[Latin Empire]], which controlled Constantinople for the next 57 years.

'''Alexei Petrovich''' ({{lang-ru|Алексей Петрович}}) ({{OldStyleDate|18 February|1690|28 February}} &amp;ndash; {{OldStyleDate|7 July|1718|26 June}}), a [[Russia]]n [[tsarevich]]. He was born in [[Moscow]], the son of Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] and his first wife [[Eudoxia Lopukhina]]. 

==Childhood==
The young Alexei was brought up by his mother, who fostered an atmosphere of disdain towards [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], Alexei's father. Alexei's relations with his father suffered from the hatred between his father and his mother, as it was very difficult for him to feel affection for his mother's worst persecutor. From the ages of 6 to 9, Alexei was educated by his tutor Vyazemsky, but after the removal of his mother by Peter the Great to the [[Suzdal]] Intercession Convent, Alexei was confined to the care of educated foreigners, who taught him history, geography, mathematics and French.

==Military career==
In [[1703]], Alexei was ordered to follow the army to the field as a private in a [[bombardier (rank)|bombardier]] regiment. In [[1704]], he was present at the capture of [[Narva]]. At this period, the preceptors of the tsarevich had the highest opinion of his ability. Alexei had strong leanings towards [[archaeology]] and [[ecclesiology]]. However, Peter had wished his son and heir to dedicate himself to the service of new [[Russia]], and demanded from him unceasing labour in order to maintain Russia's new wealth and power. Painful relations between father and son, quite apart from the prior personal antipathies, were therefore inevitable. It was an additional misfortune for Alexei that his father should have been too busy to attend to him just as he was growing up from boyhood to manhood. He was left in the hands of [[reactionary]] [[boyars]] and priests, who encouraged him to hate his father and wish for the death of the tsar-[[antichrist]]. 

In [[1708]] Peter sent Alexei to [[Smolensk]] to collect [[provender]] and [[recruit]]s, and after that to [[Moscow]] to fortify it against [[Charles XII of Sweden]]. At the end of [[1709]], Alexei went to [[Dresden]] for one year. There, he finished lessons in French, German, mathematics and fortification. After his education, Alexei married princess [[Charlotte of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], greatly against his will. The wedding was celebrated at [[Torgau]] on [[October 14]], [[1711]], in the house of the queen of [[Poland]]. Three weeks later, the bridegroom was hurried away by his father to [[Torun]] to superintend the provisioning of the Russian troops in Poland. For the next twelve months Alexei was kept constantly on the move. His wife joined him at Torun in December, but in April [[1712]] a peremptory [[ukase]] ordered him off to the army in [[Pomerania]], and in the autumn of the same year he was forced to accompany his father on a tour of inspection through [[Finland]].

==Self-exile==
Immediately on his return from Finland, Alexei was despatched by his father to [[Staraya Russa]] and [[Lake Ladoga]] to see to the building of new ships. This was the last commission entrusted to him, since Peter had not been satisfied with his son's performance and his lack of enthusiasm. Nevertheless, Peter made one last effort to &quot;reclaim&quot; his son. On [[October 11]], [[1715]], princess Charlotte died, after giving birth to a son, the grand-duke Peter, future tsar [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]]. On the day of the funeral, Peter sent Alexei a stern letter, urging him to take interest in the affairs of the state. Peter threatened to cut him off if he did not acquiesce in his father's plans. Alexei wrote a pitiful reply to his father, offering to renounce the succession in favour of his baby half-brother Peter. Furthermore, in January of [[1716]], Alexei asked his father for permission to become a [[monk]]. 

Still, Peter did not despair. On the [[August 26]], 1716 he wrote to Alexei from abroad, urging him, if he desired to remain [[tsarevich]], to join him and the army without delay. Rather than face this ordeal, Alexei fled to [[Vienna]] and placed himself under the protection of his brother-in-law, the emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]], who sent him for safety first to the [[Tirol]]ean fortress of Ahrenberg, and finally to the castle of [[San Elmo]] at [[Naples]]. He was accompanied throughout his journey by his mistress, the [[Finland|Finnish]] girl Afrosina. That the emperor sincerely sympathized with Alexei, and suspected Peter of harbouring murderous designs against his son, is plain from his confidential letter to [[George I of the United Kingdom]], whom he consulted on this delicate affair. Peter felt insulted. The flight of the tsarevich to a foreign potentate was a reproach and a scandal. He had to be recovered and brought back to Russia at all costs. This difficult task was accomplished by Count [[Peter Tolstoi]], the most subtle and unscrupulous of Peter's servants.

==The return==

Alexei would only consent to return on his father solemnly swearing, that if he came back he should not be punished in the least, but cherished as a son and allowed to live quietly on his estates and marry Afrosina.  On [[31 January]] [[1718]] the tsarevich reached Moscow. Peter had already determined to institute a most searching [[inquisition]] in order to get at the bottom of the mystery of the flight. On [[18 February]] a &quot;confession&quot; was extorted from Alexei which implicated most of his friends, and he then publicly renounced the succession to the throne in favour of the baby grand-duke Peter Petrovich. A horrible reign of terror ensued, in the course of which the ex-tsaritsa Eudoxia was dragged from her monastery and publicly tried for alleged [[adultery]], while all who had in any way befriended Alexei were [[Impalement|impale]]d, broken on the wheel and otherwise lingeringly done to death. All this was done to terrorize the reactionaries and isolate the tsarevich. 
[[Image:gay_alexis.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Peter I interrogates Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich at Peterhof'', history painting by Nikolai Ge, 1871, State Tret'yakov Gallery, Moscow]]
In April 1718 fresh confessions were extorted from Alexei. Even now there were no actual facts to go upon. The worst that could be brought against him was that he had wished his father's death. In the eyes of Peter, his son was now a self-convicted and most dangerous traitor, whose life was forfeit. But there was no getting over the fact that his father had sworn to pardon him and let him live in peace if he returned to Russia. The whole matter was solemnly submitted to a grand council of [[prelate]]s, [[senator]]s, [[Political minister|minister]]s and other [[dignitary|dignitaries]] on [[13 June]] [[1718]]. The [[clergy]] left the matter to the tsar's own decision. The temporal dignitaries declared the evidence to be insufficient and suggested that Alexei should be examined by torture. 

Accordingly, on [[19 June]], the weak and ailing tsarevich received twenty-five strokes with the [[knout]], and on the 24th - fifteen more. It was hardly possible that he could survive such treatment. On [[26 June]], Alexei died in the [[Petropavlovskaya fortress]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], two days after the senate had condemned him to death for conspiring rebellion against his father, and for hoping for the cooperation of the common people and the armed intervention of his brother-in-law, the emperor. Some historians believe that Alexei actually died of [[strangulation]] by one of Peter's servants.

'''Andrew Jackson''' ([[March 15]], [[1767]] &amp;ndash; [[June 8]], [[1845]]), was the seventh [[President of the United States]] (1829-1837), hero of the [[Battle of New Orleans]] (1815), a founder of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and the [[eponym]] of the era of [[Jacksonian democracy]].  He was a polarizing figure who helped shape the [[Second Party System]] of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] in the 1820s and 1830s.

Nicknamed &quot;Old Hickory,&quot; Jackson was the first President primarily associated with the American [[frontier]] (although born in South Carolina, he spent most of his life in Tennessee).  .

==Early life and military career==
Jackson was born in a backwoods settlement to [[Scots-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] immigrants in the [[Waxhaw, North Carolina|Waxhaw area]] in the [[Carolinas]], on [[March 15]], [[1767]]. He was the youngest son in his family. Both [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]] have claimed him as a &quot;native son.&quot; Jackson himself always stated that he was born in South Carolina. He received a sporadic education. At age thirteen, he joined the [[Continental Army]] as a courier. He was captured and imprisoned by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Jackson was the last U.S. President to have been a veteran of the American Revolution, and the only President to have been a [[prisoner of war]]. The war took the lives of Jackson's entire immediate family.

[[Image:Andrew Jackson brave boy 1780.jpg|thumb|250px|Jackson refusing to clean a British officer's boots (1876 [[lithography]])]]
During the Revolution, after the surrender to the British at Charleston, Jackson and his brother Robert were taken as prisoners, and nearly starved to death.  When Jackson refused to clean the boots of a British officer, the irate redcoat slashed at Jackson, giving him scars on his left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the British. Both of them contracted small pox while imprisoned, and Robert died days after their release. In addition, two of Jackson's brothers and his mother--his entire remaining family--died from war-time hardships that Jackson also blamed upon the British.  This [[anglophobia]] would help to inspire a distrust and dislike of Eastern &quot;aristocrats&quot;, whom Jackson felt were too inclined to favor and emulate their former colonial &quot;masters&quot;. Jackson admired [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], for his willingness to contest British military supremacy.

Jackson came to [[Tennessee]] by 1787, having barely read law, but finding that enough to become a young lawyer on the frontier. Since he was not from a distinguished family, he had to make his career by his own merits; and soon he began to prosper in the rough-and-tumble world of frontier law.  Most of the actions grew out of disputed land-claims, or from assaults and battery.  His courtroom demeanor was of his time.  In 1795, he fought a duel with an opposing counsel over a courtroom argument. He was elected as Tennessee's first [[U.S. House of Representatives|Congressman]], upon its statehood in the late 1790s, and quickly became a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] in 1797, but quit within a year. In 1798, he was appointed Judge on the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]].

===Creek War and War of 1812===
{{main articles|[[Creek War]] and [[Battle of New Orleans]]}}
Jackson became a colonel in the Tennessee militia, which he had led since 1801, the beginning of his military career. In 1813, after a massacre of 400 men, women and children at [[Fort Mims Massacre|Fort Mims]] (in what is now Alabama) by Northern [[Creek people|Creek]] Band chieftain [[Peter McQueen]], Jackson commanded in the campaign against the Northern Creek Indians of Alabama and Georgia, also known as the &quot;[[Red Sticks]]&quot;. Creek leaders such as [[William Weatherford]] (Red Eagle), Peter McQueen, and [[Menawa]], who had been allies of the British during the War of 1812, violently clashed with other chiefs of the Creek Nation over white encroachment on Creek lands, and the &quot;civilizing&quot; programs administered by U.S. Indian Agent [[Benjamin Hawkins]]. In the [[Creek War]], a theatre of the [[War of 1812]], Jackson defeated the Red Stick Creeks at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend]], aided by allies from the Southern Creek Indian Band, who had requested Jackson's aid in putting down what they considered to be the &quot;rebellious&quot; Red Sticks, and some [[Cherokee]] Indians, who also sided with the Americans. Although 800 Northern Creek Band &quot;Red Sticks&quot; Indians were killed in the battle, Jackson spared Weatherford's life from any acts of vengeance. [[Sam Houston]] and [[David Crockett]], later to become famous themselves in Texas, served under Jackson at this time.  Following the victory, Jackson imposed the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]] upon both his Northern Creek enemy and Southern Creek allies, wresting 20 million acres (81,000 km&amp;sup2;) from all Creeks, for white settlement.

Jackson's service in the [[War of 1812]] was conspicuous for its bravery and success. He was a strict officer, but was popular with his troops, and was said to have been &quot;tough as old hickory&quot; wood on the battlefield, which gave him his nickname. The war, and particularly his command at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] on [[January 8]], [[1815]], made his national reputation; and he advanced in rank to Major General. In the battle, Jackson's 6,000 militiamen behind barricades of cotton bales opposed 12,000 British regulars marching across an open field, led by General [[Edward Pakenham]]. The battle was a total American victory. The British had over 2,000 casualties to Jackson's 13 killed and 58 wounded or missing.

===First Seminole War===
{{main|Seminole Wars}}
Jackson saw military service again in the [[Seminole Wars|First Seminole War]], when he was ordered by President [[James Monroe]] in December 1817 [http://www.gilderlehrman.org/collection/document.php?id=391] to lead a campaign in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] against the [[Seminole (tribe)|Seminole]] and [[Creek people|Creek]] Indians, and to prevent [[Spanish Florida]] from becoming a &quot;refuge for runaway slaves&quot;.  It was later said that Jackson exceeded his orders in Florida actions, but Monroe and the public wanted Florida.  Before going, Jackson wrote to Monroe, &quot;Let it be signified to me through any channel (say Mr. John Rhea [a mutual confidant]) that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished.&quot; Monroe gave Jackson orders that were purposely ambiguous, sufficient for international denials.

Jackson's Tennessee volunteers were attacked by Seminoles, but this left their villages vulnerable, and Jackson burned them and their crops.  In his investigation, he found letters that indicated that the Spanish and British were &quot;secretly&quot; assisting the Indians.  Jackson believed that the United States would not be &quot;secure&quot; as long as Spain and Great Britain encouraged American Indians to fight, and argued that his actions were undertaken in &quot;self-defense&quot;. Jackson captured Pensacola with little more than some warning shots, and deposed the Spanish governor. He captured, tried, and executed two British subjects who had been supplying and advising the Indians. Jackson's action also struck fear into the Seminole tribes, as word of his ruthlessness in battle spread.

This also created an international incident, and many in the [[James Monroe|Monroe]] administration called for Jackson to be censured. However, Jackson's actions were defended by his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[John Quincy Adams]]. When the Spanish minister demanded a &quot;suitable punishment&quot; for Jackson, Adams wrote back &quot;Spain must immediately [decide] either to place a force in Florida adequate at once to the protection of her territory, ... or cede to the United States a province, of which she retains nothing but the nominal possession, but which is, in fact, ... a post of annoyance to them.&quot; Adams used Jackson's conquest, and Spain's own &quot;weaknesses&quot;, to convince the Spanish (in the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]]) to cede Florida to the United States.  Jackson was subsequently appointed territorial governor there.

==Election of 1824==
{{main|U.S. presidential election, 1824}}
During his first run for the Presidency in [[U.S._presidential_election,_1824|1824]], Jackson received a [[plurality]] of both the popular and [[electoral]] votes. Since no candidate received a majority, the election was thrown into the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], which chose John Quincy Adams instead.  Jackson denounced it as a &quot;[[corrupt bargain]]&quot; because [[Henry Clay]] threw his votes to Adams, who then made Clay Secretary of State.  Jackson later called for abolishing the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]]. Jackson's defeat burnished his political credentials, however; since many voters believed the &quot;man of the people&quot; had been robbed by the &quot;corrupt aristocrats of the East&quot;. 

Jackson had enemies.  [[Albert Gallatin]], who for a while in 1824 was a vice presidential candidate, saw Jackson as &quot;an honest man and the idol of the worshippers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional. provisions, altogether unfit for the office.&quot; [Adams 599] 

Thomas Jefferson in retirement said of Jackson in 1824:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I feel much alarmed at the prospect of seeing General Jackson President. He is one of the most unfit men I know of for such a place. He has had very little respect for laws or constitutions, and is, in fact, an able military chief. His passions are terrible. When I was President of the Senate he was a Senator; and he could never speak on account of the rashness of his feelings. I have seen him attempt it repeatedly, and as often choke with rage. His passions are no doubt cooler now; he has been much tried since I knew him, but he is a dangerous man.&quot; {{ref|Jefferson}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Election of 1828==
{{main|United States presidential election, 1828}}

==Presidency 1829-1837==
===Spoils system===
Jackson is accused of introducing the &quot;[[spoils system]]&quot;, or &quot;patronage&quot;, to American politics.  The term &quot;spoils system&quot; was attributed to Senator [[William L. Marcy]] of New York, who was quoted as saying, &quot;To the victor belong the spoils.&quot; Upon Jackson's election as President, a sizable number of federal officers found that they had suddenly been replaced by supporters and friends of Jackson.  Jackson saw this system as promoting the growth of democracy, rewarding people who were involved in his party and thus encouraging others to get involved.

===Opposition to the National Bank===
{{main|Second Bank of the United States}}
[[image:AJ~bank.JPG|thumb|400px|Democratic cartoon shows Jackson fighting the monster Bank]]
As president, Jackson worked to take away the federal charter of the [[Second Bank of the United States]] (it would continue to exist as a state bank). The original [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] had been introduced in 1791 by [[Alexander Hamilton]], as a way of organizing the federal government's finances. This first Bank's charter lapsed in 1811. It was followed by the second Bank, authorized during [[James Madison]]'s tenure in offce in 1816 for a 20 year period, to &quot;alleviate the economic problems caused by the War of 1812&quot;. Both Banks were instrumental in the growth of the U.S. economy; but Jackson opposed the concept on ideological grounds. In Jackson's opinion, the Bank needed to be abolished because:
* it was unconstitutional
* it concentrated an excessive amount of the nation's financial strength into one single institution
* it exposed the government to control by &quot;foreign interests&quot;
* it exercised too much control over members of the Congress
* it favored Northeastern states over Southern and Western (now Mid-western) states
* Jackson had a strong personal and political dislike for the Bank's president, [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]]

Jackson followed Jefferson as a supporter of the ideal of an &quot;agricultural republic&quot;, and felt the Bank improved the fortunes of an &quot;elite circle&quot; of commercial and industrial entrepreneurs, at the expense of farmers and laborers. After a titanic struggle, Jackson succeeded in destroying the Bank, by vetoing its 1832 re-charter by Congress, and by withdrawing U.S. funds in 1833. The Bank's money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that sprang up feeding an expansion of credit and speculation; the commercial progress of the nation's economy was noticeably dented.

The [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] censured Jackson on March 27, 1834 for his actions in defunding the Bank of the United States; the censure was later expunged when the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate.

===Nullification crisis===
{{main|Nullification crisis}}
[[Image:andrew_jackson_20bill.jpg|thumb|left|Andrew Jackson is depicted on the U.S. $20 bill.]]

Another notable crisis during Jackson's period of office was the &quot;[[nullification crisis]]&quot;, or &quot;secession crisis&quot;, of 1828&amp;ndash;1832, which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over trade [[tariff]]s. Critics alleged that high tariffs (the &quot;[[Tariff of Abominations]]&quot;) on imports of common manufactured goods made European goods more expensive than ones from the northern US, and raised the prices paid by planters in the southern US.  Southern politicians thus had an argument, to the effect that tariffs benefitted northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers.

The issue came to a head when Vice President [[John C. Calhoun]], in the [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] of 1828, supported the claim of his home state, [[South Carolina]], that it had the right to &quot;nullify&quot;&amp;mdash;declare illegal&amp;mdash;the tariff legislation of 1828, and more generally the right of a state to nullify laws which went against its interests. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he was also a strong supporter of a strong union, with considerable powers for the central government. Jackson attempted to face Calhoun down over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men. Particularly famous was an incident at the April 13, 1829 Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts. Jackson rose first and voice booming, and glaring at Calhoun, yelled out &quot;Our federal Union: IT MUST BE PRESERVED!&quot;, a clear challenge to Calhoun. Calhoun glared at Jackson and yelled out, his voice trembling, but booming as well, &quot;The Union: NEXT TO OUR LIBERTY, MOST DEAR!&quot;, an astonishingly quick-witted riposte.

In response to South Carolina's threat, Congress passed a &quot;[[Force Bill]]&quot; in 1833, and Jackson vowed to send troops to South Carolina in order to enforce the laws.  In December 1832, he issued a resounding proclamation against the &quot;nullifiers&quot;, stating: &quot;I consider...the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.&quot;  South Carolina, the president declared, stood on &quot;the brink of insurrection and treason,&quot; and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought.  Jackson also denied the right of secession: &quot;The Constitution...forms a ''government'' not a league...To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation.&quot;

The crisis was resolved in 1833 with a compromise settlement orchestrated by [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] politician [[Henry Clay]] and adopted by a South Carolina convention. The settlement substantially lowered the tariffs and hinted that the central government considered itself &quot;weak&quot; in dealing with determined opposition by an individual state. To enforce this view, the convention proudly but pointlessly declared the federal Force Bill nullified, even though the bill was only meaningful with respect to the tariff nullification. Thus, the South Carolina legislature both averted major conflict with the federal government, and reaffirmed Calhoun's beloved doctrine of nullification.

===Indian Removal===
[[Image:Andrew_Jackson_Statue_Nashville.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Andrew Jackson in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].]]

Today, perhaps the most controversial aspect of Andrew Jackson's presidency was his policy regarding [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]]. Jackson was a leading advocate of a policy known as &quot;[[Indian Removal]]&quot;, signing the [[Indian Removal Act]] into law in 1830. Contrary to popular misconception, the Removal Act did not order the removal of any American Indians; what it did was authorize the President to negotiate treaties to purchase tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west, outside of existing U.S. state borders. According to biographer [[Robert V. Remini]], Jackson promoted this policy primarily for reasons of national security, seeing that Great Britain and Spain had recruited Native Americans within U.S. borders in previous wars with the United States.&lt;!--Remini (2001), p.113--&gt; According to historian Anthony Wallace, Jackson never publically advocated removing American Indians by force. Instead, Jackson made the negotiation of treaties a priority: nearly seventy Indian treaties&amp;mdash;many of them land sales&amp;mdash;were ratified during his presidency, more than in any other administration. 

The Removal Act was especially popular in the [[American South|South]], where population growth and the discovery of gold on [[Cherokee]] land had increased pressure on tribal lands. The state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] became involved in a contentious jurisdictional dispute with the Cherokees, culminating in the 1832 Supreme Court decision (''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'') that ruled that Georgia could not impose its laws upon Cherokee tribal lands. About this case, Jackson is often quoted as having said, &quot;[[John Marshall]] has made his decision, now let him enforce it!&quot; Jackson probably never said this; the popular story that Jackson defied the Supreme Court in carrying out Indian Removal is untrue. In fact, Jackson had no clear legal right to intervene on behalf of the Cherokees in Georgia.

Instead, Jackson used the Georgia crisis to pressure Cherokee leaders to sign a removal treaty. A faction of Cherokees led by Jackson's old ally [[Major Ridge]] negotiated the [[Treaty of New Echota]] with Jackson's administration, a document of dubious legality which was rejected by most Cherokees. However, the terms of the treaty were strictly enforced by Jackson's successor, [[Martin Van Buren]], which resulted in the deaths of thousands of Cherokees along the &quot;[[Trail of Tears]]&quot;.

In all, more than 45,000 American Indians were relocated to the West during Jackson's administration. During this time, the administration purchased about 100 million acres of Indian land for about $68 million and 32 million acres of western land. Though the relocation process was generally popular with the American people at the time, it resulted in much suffering and death among American Indians. Jackson was criticized at the time for his role in these events, and the criticism has grown over the years. Robert Remini characterizes the Indian Removal era as &quot;one of the unhappiest chapters in American history&quot;. {{ref|remini}}

===Assassination attempt===
[[Image:JacksonAssassinationAttempt.jpg|thumb|right|200px||The etching of the assassination attempt.]]
On January 30, 1835 an unsuccessful [[assassination]] attempt against Jackson occurred in the [[United States Capital]]. This was the first assassination attempt made against an American President. As Jackson left a funeral, a man named [[Richard Lawrence]] approached Jackson and fired a pistol at point-blank range. The would-be assasin was thwarted as his pistol misfired. He immediately drew another pistol, which also misfired, at which point Jackson attacked him with his cane, subduing him.  Lawrence was later found to be mentally ill and commited to an insane asylum.

==Family and personal life==
[[Image:Andrew Jackson Portrait.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Portrait of Andrew Jackson]]
Jackson's wife, [[Rachel Donelson Robards Jackson|Rachel]], died of a heart attack just 2 months prior to his taking office as President. She had supposedly divorced her first husband, Col. Lewis Robards; but there were &quot;questions&quot; about the legality of the divorce. Jackson deeply resented attacks on his wife's honor; he killed [[Charles Dickinson (historical figure)|Charles Dickinson]] in a duel over a horse-racing debt and an insult to his wife on [[May 30]], [[1806]]. Jackson was also injured during the duel, and the bullet was so close to his heart that it could never be safely removed. It caused him considerable pain for the rest of his life. Jackson blamed [[John Quincy Adams]] for Rachel's death, because of the marital scandal being brought up in the election of 1828. He felt that this had hastened her death, and never forgave Adams.  

Jackson had two adopted sons, [[Andrew Jackson Jr.]], the son of Rachel's brother Severn Donelson, and Lyncoya, a [[Creek people|Creek]] Indian orphan adopted by Jackson after the [[Creek War]]. Lyncoya died in 1828 at age 16, probably from [[pneumonia]] or [[tuberculosis]]. 

The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children.  John Samuel Donelson, Daniel Donelson, and [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]] were the sons of Rachel's brother Samuel Donelson who died in 1804.  Andrew Jackson Hutchings was Rachel's orphaned grand nephew.  Caroline Butler, Eliza Butler, Edward Butler, and Anthony Butler were the orphaned children of Edward Butler, a family friend.  They came to live with Andrew and Rachel after the death of their father.

The widower Jackson invited Rachel's niece [[Emily Donelson]] to act as his White House hostess and unofficial [[FLOTUS|First Lady]].  Emily was married to [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]], who acted as Jackson's [[private secretary]].  The relationship between the President and Emily became strained during the [[Petticoat Affair]], and the two became estranged for over a year.  They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House hostess.  [[Sarah Yorke Jackson]], the wife of Andrew Jackson Jr., became co-hostess of the White House in 1834.  It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady.  Sarah took over all hostess duties after Emily died in 1836.  

Jackson remained influential in both national and state politics after retiring to &quot;[[The Hermitage]]&quot;, his [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] home, in 1837. Though a slave-holder, Jackson was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states, and declined to give any support to talk of [[secession]].  

Jackson was a lean figure standing at 6 feet, 1 inch (1.85 m) tall, and weighing between 130 and 140 pounds (64 kg) on average. Jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair, which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61, in 1829.  He had a pair of penetrating deep blue eyes. Jackson was one of the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough that often brought up blood and sometimes even made his whole body shake. After retiring to Nashville he enjoyed eight more years of retirement and died at the Hermitage on June 8, 1845 at the age of 78, of chronic tuberculosis, &quot;[[dropsy]]&quot; and heart failure. His last words were: &quot;Oh, do not cry. Be good children, and we shall all meet in Heaven.&quot;

In his will, Jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr., except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various other friends and family members.  Jackson left several [[slaves]] to his daughter-in-law, and grandchildren.  Jackson left a sword to his grandson, with the injunction, ''&quot;that he will always use it in defence of our glorious Union.&quot;''

* The story of Andrew and Rachel Jackson's life together was told in [[Irving Stone]]'s best-selling 1951 novel ''The President's Lady'', which was made into the 1953 film of the same title, starring [[Susan Hayward]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[John McIntire]], and [[Carl Betz]] and directed by [[Henry Levin]]. The relationship between the two was also the basis of a successful documentary by the [[Public Broadcasting Service]], called ''Rachel and Andrew Jackson: A Love Story.''

* Heston played Jackson in the 1958 version of ''[[The Buccaneer]]'', a film about the role of pirate [[Jean Lafitte]] in the [[Battle of New Orleans]].  [[Hugh Sothern]] played Jackson in the original 1938 version of the film.

==Trivia==
* During Jackson's Administration, the U.S Government was, for the first and ([[as of 2006]]) only time, debt free. 
* During the 1828 election, his opponents referred to him as a &quot;Jackass&quot;.  Jackson liked the name and used the Jackass as a symbol for a while, but it died out. [http://www.c-span.org/questions/week174.htm]

{{Otherpeople|Andrew Johnson}}
'''Andrew Johnson''' ([[December 29]] [[1808]] – [[July 31]] [[1875]]) was the sixteenth [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] (1865) and the seventeenth [[President of the United States]] (1865–1869), succeeding to the presidency upon the assassination of [[Abraham Lincoln]].  

Johnson presided over the [[Reconstruction]] of the United States following the [[American Civil War]], and his conciliatory policies towards the defeated rebels and his vetoes of [[civil rights]] bills embroiled him in a bitter dispute with the Congressional Republicans, leading the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to [[impeachment|impeach]] him in 1868; he was the first President to be impeached. He was subsequently acquitted by a single vote in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. 

==Early life== 
Johnson was born on [[December 29]], [[1808]], in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], to Jacob Johnson and Mary McDonough. When Johnson was four his father died. At the age of 10 he was apprenticed to a tailor, but ran away to [[Greeneville, Tennessee]] in 1826, where he continued his employment as a tailor. He never attended any type of school; his wife, [[Eliza McCardle Johnson]], has historically been credited with teaching him to read and write.

==Early political career==
Johnson served as an [[alderman]] in [[Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville]] from 1828 to 1830 and mayor of Greeneville from 1830 to 1833. He was a member of the [[Tennessee House of Representatives|State House of Representatives]] from 1835 to 1837 and from 1839 to 1841. He was elected to the [[Tennessee Senate|State Senate]] in 1841, and elected as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] to the Twenty-eighth and to the four succeeding Congresses ([[March 4]] [[1843]] to [[March 3]] [[1853]]).  He was chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Public Expenditures]] (Thirty-first and Thirty-second Congresses).

==Political ascension==
Johnson did not seek renomination, having become a candidate for the governorship of [[Tennessee]]. He was Governor of Tennessee from 1853 to 1857, and was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate and served from [[October 8]] [[1857]] to [[March 4]] [[1862]], when he resigned. He was chairman of the [[Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense]] (Thirty-sixth Congress). At the time of [[secession]] of [[Confederate States of America|the Confederacy]], Johnson was the only Senator from the seceded states to continue participation in Congress. Johnson was then appointed by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] as Military Governor of Tennessee in 1862.

==Presidency 1865-1869==
===Assumption===
As a leading War Democrat and pro-Union southerner, Johnson was attractive to the Republicans in 1864 as they tried to enlarge their base to include War Democrats. He was elected [[Vice President of the United States]] on the National Union ticket headed by Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1864 and was inaugurated [[March 4]] [[1865]]. A rather embarrassing incident occurred on this day: Johnson had been suffering from typhoid fever and drank whiskey before the ceremony. He gave a rambling, incoherent speech and had to be led away. Lincoln forgave him for this transgression. He became President of the United States on [[April 15]] [[1865]], upon the death of Lincoln. He was the first Vice President to succeed to the U.S. Presidency upon the assassination of a President and the third to succeed upon the death of a President.

Johnson had an ambiguous party status. The National Union party vanished after the 1864 election but he did not identify with either party while president--though he did try for the Democratic nomination in 1868. Asked why he did not become a Democrat in July 1868 he said &quot;It is true I am asked why don't I join the Democratic party. Why don't they join me?&quot; [Trefouse p 339] 

===Policies===
The Johnson Administration negotiated the [[Alaska purchase|purchase of Alaska]] from Russia on [[April 9]] [[1867]] for $7,200,000.

===Impeachment===
Congress and Johnson argued in an increasingly public way about [[Reconstruction]]: the manner in which the Southern secessionist states would be readmitted to the Union. Johnson favored a very quick restoration of all rights and privileges of other states. However, &quot;Congressional Reconstruction&quot;, enforced by repeated acts passed over Johnson's [[veto]], provided for provisional state governments run by the military and ensuring the local passage of [[civil rights]] laws and otherwise imposing the will of the United States Congress &amp;mdash; which was run by the North. Johnson's public criticisms of Congress provoked much talk of impeachment over the months.

[[Image:3a05488v.jpg|250px|thumb|''Harper's Weekly'' illustration of Johnson's impeachment trial in the [[United States Senate]].]]
On [[February 21]], [[1868]], Johnson notified Congress that he had removed [[Edwin Stanton]] as Secretary of War, and was replacing him in the interim with Adjutant-General [[Lorenzo Thomas]]. This violated the [[Tenure of Office Act]], a law enacted by Congress on [[March 2]], [[1867]], over Johnson's veto, specifically designed to protect Stanton. Johnson had vetoed the Act, claiming it was unconstitutional. The Act said, &quot;...every person holding any civil office, to which he has been appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate ... shall be entitled to hold such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed and duly qualified,&quot; thus removing the President's previous unlimited power to remove any of his Cabinet members at will. Years later in the case ''[[Myers v. United States]]'' in 1926, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that such laws were indeed unconstitutional.

The Senate and House entered into hot debate. Thomas attempted to move into the War office, for which Stanton had Thomas arrested. Three days after Stanton's removal, the House passed a resolution to impeach Johnson for &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot;, specifically, for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act and thus violating the law of the land, which he had sworn an oath to enforce.  

[[Image:AJohnsonimpeach.jpg|thumb|left||The 1868 Impeachment Resolution]]
On [[March 5]], [[1868]] a court of impeachment was constituted in the Senate to hear charges against the President. [[William M. Evarts]] served as his counsel. Eleven articles were set out in the resolution and the trial before the Senate lasted almost three months. Johnson's defense was based on a clause in the Tenure of Office Act stating that the then-current Secretaries would hold their posts throughout the term of the President who appointed them. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, it was claimed, the applicability of the Act had already run its course.

There were three votes in the Senate: one on [[May 16]], [[1868]] for the 11th article of impeachment, which included many of the charges contained in the other articles, and two on [[May 26]] for the second and third articles, after which the trial adjourned ''[[sine die]]''. On all three occasions, thirty-five Senators voted &quot;Guilty&quot; and nineteen &quot;Not Guilty&quot;. As the [[United States Constitution]] requires a two-thirds majority for conviction in impeachment trials, Johnson was acquitted.

A single changed vote would have sufficed to return a &quot;Guilty&quot; verdict. The decisive vote had been that of a young [[Radical Republican]] named [[Edmund G. Ross]]. Despite monumental pressure from fellow Radicals prior to the first vote, and dire warnings that a vote for acquittal would end his political career, Ross stood up at the appropriate moment and quietly announced &quot;not guilty,&quot; effectively ending the impeachment trial. 

Johnson was the first President to be impeached, and the only one until [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton]] on [[December 19]], [[1998]]. Both presidents were acquitted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Solzhenitsyn.jpg|right|thumb|Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] 

'''Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Иса́евич Солжени́цын}}; born in [[Kislovodsk]], [[Russia]], on [[December 11]], [[1918]]) is a [[Russia|Russian]] [[novel|novelist]], [[drama|dramatist]] and [[historian]]. He was responsible for thrusting awareness of the [[Gulag]] on the world. 
Solzhenitsyn was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in [[1970]] and was exiled from the [[Soviet Union]] in [[1974]].

== In the Soviet Union ==

Solzhenitsyn studied [[mathematics]] at [[Rostov State University]], while at the same time taking correspondence courses from the [[Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature, and History]].  During [[World War II]], he served as the commander of an artillery position finding company in the [[Soviet Army]], was involved in major action at the front, and was twice decorated.  In February [[1945]] while serving in [[East Prussia]] he was arrested for criticising [[Joseph Stalin]] in private correspondence with a friend and sentenced to an eight-year term in a [[labour camp]], to be followed by permanent internal exile.  

The first part of Solzehnitsyn's sentence was served in several different work camps; the &quot;middle phase&quot;, as he later referred to it, was spent in a ''[[sharashka]]'', special scientific research facilities run by Ministry of State Security:  these formed the experiences distilled in ''The First Circle'', published in the West in [[1968]].   In [[1950]] he was sent to a &quot;Special Camp&quot; for political prisoners.  During his imprisonment at the camp in the town of [[Ekibastuz]] in [[Kazakhstan]] he worked as a [[miner]], a [[bricklayer]], and a [[foundry]]man.  His experiences at Ekibastuz formed the basis for the ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''.  While there he had a tumor removed, although his [[cancer]] was not then diagnosed.  

From [[March]] [[1953]] Solzhenitsyn began a sentence of internal exile for life at Kol-Terek in southern [[Kazakhstan]].  His undiagnosed cancer spread, until by the end of the year he was close to death.  However in [[1954]] he was permitted to be treated in a hospital in [[Tashkent]], where he was cured.  These experiences became the basis of his novel ''Cancer Ward''.

During his years of exile, and following his reprieve and return to European Russia, Solzhenitsyn was, while teaching at a secondary school during the day, spending his nights secretly engaged in writing.  He later wrote, in the short [[autobiography]] written at the time of his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize]], that &quot;during all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced that I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared that this would become known.&quot; 

Finally, when he was 42 years old, he approached a poet and the chief editor of the ''Noviy Mir'' magazine [[Alexander Tvardovsky]] with the manuscript of ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''. It was published in [[1962]], and  would remain his only major work to be published in the Soviet Union until [[1990]].  It was during this decade of imprisonment and exile that Solzhenitsyn abandoned his youthful [[Marxism]] and evolved toward his mature philosophical and religious positions.  His gradual turn to a philosophically-minded [[Christianity]] is described at some length in the fourth part of ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]].'' (&quot;The Soul and Barbed Wire.&quot;)

[[Image:Arch gulag cover.jpg|left|thumb|Solzhenitsyn was exiled from the [[Soviet Union]] for his book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]].'']] 

''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' brought the Soviet system of prison labor to the attention of the West, but it was his monumental history of the Soviet prisons for both criminal and political prisoners that won him the most acclaim in the West.  It caused as much a sensation in the Soviet Union as it did the West.  But the attention devoted to it in the West meant that Solzhenitsyn was a marked man.  The printing of his work quickly stopped, and by [[1965]] the KGB had seized his papers, including the manuscript of &lt;i&gt;The First Circle&lt;/i&gt;.  Meanwhile Solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most subversive of all his writings, the monumental &lt;i&gt;Gulag Archipelago&lt;/i&gt;.

''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' was a three volume work on the Soviet prison camp system.  It was based upon Solzhenitsyn's own experience as well as the testimony of 227 former prisoners.  It discussed the system's origins from [[Lenin]] and the very founding of the Communist regime.  The appearance of the book in the West put the word [[gulag]] into the Western political vocabulary and guaranteed swift retribution from the Soviet authorities. On [[February 13]], [[1974]], Solzhenitsyn was deported from the Soviet Union to [[West Germany]] and stripped of his Soviet citizenship.

== In the West ==

After a time in [[Switzerland]], Solzhenitsyn was given accommodation by [[Stanford University]] to &quot;facilitate [your] work, and to accommodate you and your family&quot; He stayed on the 11th floor of the Hoover Tower, part of the [[Hoover Institution]]. Solzhenitsyn moved to [[Vermont]] in [[1976]].  Over the next 18 years Solzhenitsyn completed his historical cycle of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], ''The Red Wheel'', and several shorter works.  In [[1990]] his Soviet citizenship was restored, and in [[1994]] he returned to Russia.

Despite an enthusiastic welcome on his first arrival in America, followed by respect for his privacy, he had never been comfortable outside his homeland. Solzhenitsyn's warnings about the dangers of Communist aggression and the weakening of the moral fiber of the West were generally well received in conservative circles in the West.  But liberals and secularists were increasingly critical of what they perceived as his [[reactionary]] preference for [[Russia]]n patriotism and the [[Russian Orthodox]] religion. He also harshly criticised what he saw as the ugliness and spiritual vapidity of the dominant [[pop culture]] of the modern West, for example television and rock music: &quot;...the human soul longs for things higher, warmer and purer than those offered by today's mass living habits...by TV stupor and by intolerable music.&quot; 

== Return to Russia ==

Since returning to Russia in 1994 Solzhenitsyn has published eight two-part short stories, a series of contemplative &quot;miniatures&quot; or prose poems, a literary memoir on his years in the West (''The Grain Between the Millstones'') and a two-volume work on the history of Russian-Jewish relations (''Two Hundred Years Together'' 2001, 2002).  The latter has been received as philo-semitic by some and anti-semitic by others.  In it, Solzhenitsyn emphatically repudiates the idea that the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917 were the work of a &quot;Jewish conspiracy&quot; (see chapters 9, 14, and 15 of that work).  At the same time, he calls on both Russians and Jews to come to terms with the members of their peoples who acted in complicity with the Communist regime.  The reception of this work confirms that Solzhenitsyn remains a polarizing figure both at home and abroad.

In his recent political writings, such as ''Rebuilding Russia'' (1990) and ''Russia in Collapse'' (1998) Solzhenitsyn has criticized the oligarchic excesses of the new Russian 'democracy' while opposing any nostalgia for Soviet communism.  He has defended moderate and self-critical patriotism (as opposed to extreme nationalism), argued for the indispensability of local self-government to a free Russia, and expressed concerns for the fate of 25 million ethnic Russians in the &quot;near abroad&quot; of the former Soviet Union.

One of his sons, [[Ignat Solzhenitsyn]], has achieved acclaim as a [[pianist]] and [[conductor (music)|conductor]] in the United States.

[[Image:Aberdeen (location).png|thumb|235px|Aberdeen's location in Scotland]] 
'''Aberdeen''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Obar Dheathain'', 'confluence of the [River] Don'), often called '''The Granite City''', is [[Scotland]]'s third largest [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], with a population of 212,125, and the greatest part of the [[unitary authority|unitary]] [[council area]] named the [[City of Aberdeen]], which is surrounded by, but not within, the [[Aberdeenshire]] council area. Aberdeen is the chief commercial centre and [[port|seaport]] in the north-east of Scotland.

It boasts the title of '''Oil Capital of Europe''' thanks to the plentiful supply of [[crude oil]] in the [[North Sea]], and stands on a bay of the North Sea, between the mouths of the rivers [[River Don, Aberdeenshire|Don]] and [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Dee]]. The city is currently run by a coalition of 20 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Scottish Liberal Democrat]] and 3 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] councillors.

==Coat of Arms and Motto==
The [[coat of arms]] shows a red shield bearing three triple towered castles within the double royal tressure. It is widely accepted that these represent the fortifications which from earliest times stood on the three hills where the city sprang up, namely Castle Hill, the Port or Windmill Hill (Gallowgate) and St Catherine's Hill (Adelphi). The Arms are supported by two leopards - one either side - and above, the scroll with the words 'Bon Accord'.

Legend has it that during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], when the Castle of Aberdeen was stormed and the English troops 'were killed all in one night', the watchword to initiate the campaign was 'Bon Accord', and it is from this massacre that the Coat of Arms and the motto originated.

==History==
Aberdeen grew up as two separate burghs - [[Old Aberdeen]] at the mouth of the Don and New Aberdeen, a fishing and trading settlement where the Denburn entered the Dee estuary. The earliest charter was granted by King [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]] about 1179, confirming the corporate rights granted by David I. The city received other royal charters later. In 1319, the Great Charter of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] transformed Aberdeen into a property owning and financially independent community. Bruce had a high regard for the citizens of Aberdeen who had sheltered him in his days of outlawry, helped him win the Battle of Barra and slayed the English garrison at the Castle. He granted Aberdeen with the nearby Forest of Stocket. The income from this land has formed the basis for the city's Common Good Fund, which is used to this day for the benefit of all Aberdonians. 

The city was burned by [[Edward III of England]] in 1336, but was soon rebuilt and extended, and called New Aberdeen. For many centuries the city was subject to attacks by the neighbouring lords, and was strongly fortified, but the gates were all removed by 1770. In 1497 a blockhouse was built at the harbour mouth as a protection against the English. During the [[Scottish Civil War]] of 1644-47 between the Royalists and Covenanters the city was impartially plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and sacked by Royalist troops comprising of Irishmen and Highlanders after the [[battle of Aberdeen]]. In 1715 the Earl Marischal proclaimed the Old Pretender at Aberdeen, and in 1745 the Duke of Cumberland resided for a short time in the city before attacking the Young Pretender. 

In the [[18th century]] a new Town Hall was built, elegantly furnished with a marble fireplace from Holland and a set of fine crystal chandeliers and sconces. The latter are still a feature in the Town House. This century also saw the beginnings of social services for the Infirmary at Woolmanhill which was opened in 1742 and the Lunatic Asylum in 1779.

The [[19th century]] was a time of considerable expansion. By 1901 the population was 153,000 and the city covered more than 6,000 acres (24 km²). In the late 18th century, the council embarked on a scheme of road improvements, and by 1805 George Street, King Street and Union Street were open, the latter a feat of extraordinary engineering skill involving the partial levelling of St Catherine's Hill and the building of arches to carry the street over Putachieside. The Denburn Valley was crossed by Union Street with a single span arch of 130 ft (40 m). Along these new streets was built the nucleus of the ''Granite City'' in buildings designed by John Smith and [[Archibald Simpson]].

The increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries brought a need for improved harbour facilities. During this century much of the harbour as it exists today was built including Victoria Dock, the South Breakwater and the extension to the North Pier. Such an expensive building programme had, of course, repercussions, and in 1817 the city was in a state of bankruptcy. However, a recovery was made in the general prosperity which followed the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Improvements in street lighting came in 1824 with the advent of gas, and a vast improvement was made to the water supply in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a reservoir in Union Place. An underground sewerage system was begun in 1865 to replace the open sewers which previously ran along certain of the streets.

==Background==

[[Image:Elphinstone_Hall2.jpg|thumb|University of Aberdeen, Elphinstone Hall]]

Though Old Aberdeen, extending from the area surrounding the [[University of Aberdeen]] to the southern banks of the Don, had a separate charter,  privileges, and history, the distinction between it and New Aberdeen can no longer be said to exist. Aberdeen's popular name of the &quot;Granite City&quot;, is justified by the fact that the bulk of the city is built of [[granite]], but to appreciate its more poetical designation of the &quot;Silver City by the Golden Sands&quot;, it should be seen after a heavy rainfall when its public buildings and countless houses gleam pure and white under brilliant sunshine. It is also known as the 'Flower of Scotland', as Aberdeen has long been famous for its outstanding parks, gardens and floral displays that include 2 million roses, 11 million daffodils and 3 million crocuses. Aberdeen has won the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Britain in Bloom]] contest on numerous occasions, and at one time was banned from entering to enable other cities to win. On [[5 March]], [[2003]] Aberdeen was granted [[Fairtrade City]] status. 

The area of the city extends to 71.22 square miles (184.46 [[square kilometre|km²]]), and includes the former burghs of Old Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, Woodside and the district of [[Torry]] to the south of the Dee. The city was first [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] in 1891. The city is represented in Westminster by two MPs who are both from the Labour party, and in the [[Scottish Parliament]] by three MSPs (one Labour, one SNP and one Liberal Democrat). The city council comprises forty-three councillors who represent the city's [[ward (politics)|wards]] and is headed by the Lord Provost. The current [[List of Provosts and Lord Provosts of Aberdeen|Lord Provost]] is John Reynolds.

As of 1996, Aberdeen has been governed by the unitary [[City of Aberdeen|Aberdeen City Council]] and no longer has any direct control over the neighbouring area of [[Aberdeenshire (unitary)|Aberdeenshire]] (although the headquarters of Aberdeenshire Council are located within the city's boundaries).

Aberdeen has good links to the rest of Scotland and the UK. The main road south to [[Edinburgh]] is a fast dual carriageway and plans are in hand to build a bypass round the city. Aberdeen is served by good rail links to the south and north to [[Inverness]], all services running from the Railway Station in the city centre. Although there are no direct sea links south any more there is still a ferry service running to [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]. [[Aberdeen Airport]] is located at Dyce, about 5 miles (8 km) north west of the city centre, and has frequent services to [[London]] and several international destinations.

The mean temperature is 8 °[[Celsius|C]] (47 °[[Fahrenheit|F]]) and it varies between 0.4 °C (32.7 °F) in winter and 17.6 °C  (63.7 °[[Fahrenheit|F]]) in summer. The average yearly rainfall is 816 [[millimetre|mm]]. The city is one of the healthiest in Scotland.

Union Street is one of the most imposing and famous thoroughfares in Britain. From Castle Street it runs for nearly a mile (1.5 km), is 70 ft (21 m) wide, and originally contained the principal shops and most of the public buildings, all of granite. Part of the street crosses the Denburn ravine (utilized for the line of the Great North of Scotland railway) by Union Bridge, a fine granite arch of 132 ft (40 m) span, with portions of the older town still fringing the gorge, 50 feet (15 m) below the level of Union Street. Union Street was built from 1801 to 1805, and named after the 1800 Act of Union with [[Ireland]].

Amongst the notable buildings in the street are the Town and County Bank, the Music Hall 1822, the Trinity Hall of the incorporated trades (originating between 1398 and 1527), now a shopping mall; the Palace Hotel; the former office of the Northern Assurance Company, and the National Bank of Scotland. 

In Castle Street, a continuation eastwards of Union Street, is the Town House, the headquarters of the city council. One of the most splendid granite edifices in Scotland, in the Franco-Scottish Gothic style, it contains the great hall, with an open timber ceiling and oak-panelled walls; the Sheriff Court House; the Town and County Hall, with portraits of [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]], the 4th [[Earl of Aberdeen]], various Lord Provosts and other distinguished citizens. In the vestibule of the entrance corridor stands a suit of black armour, believed to have been worn by Provost [[Sir Robert Davidson]], who fought in the [[Battle of Harlaw]] in 1411. On the south-western corner is the 210 ft (64 m) grand tower, which commands a fine view of the city and surrounding country. Adjoining the Town House is the old North of Scotland Bank building, in [[Greek Revival]] style. This building is now a pub named the [[Archibald Simpson]], after its original architect. On the opposite side of the street is the fine building of the Union Bank.

At the upper end of Castlegate stands [[The Salvation Army]] Citadel, an effective castellated mansion, on the site of the medieval castle. In front of it is the [[Market Cross]], built in 1686 by [[John Montgomery]], a native architect. This open-arched structure, 21 ft (6 m) in diameter and 18 ft (5 m) high, comprises a large hexagonal base from the centre of which rises a shaft with a Corinthian capital, on which is the royal [[unicorn]]. The base is highly decorated, including medallions illustrating Scottish monarchs from [[James I of Scotland|James I]] to [[James VII of Scotland|James VII]]. To the east of Castle Street were the military barracks, which were demolished in 1965 and replaced with two tower blocks.

Marischal College on Broad Street, opened by King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] in 1906, is the second largest granite building in the world (after the [[Escorial]], [[Madrid]]), and is one of the most splendid examples of Edwardian architecture in Britain. The architect, [[Alexander Marshall Mackenzie]], a native of Aberdeen, adapted his material, white granite, to the design of the building with the originality of genius. This magnificent building is sadly no longer a seat of learning and is under renovation as the new home of Aberdeen City Council.

There are no tramways in Aberdeen. The last [[tram]] went through the streets on [[May 3]] [[1958]]. All trams except one were scrapped. The last tram is on display in the Transport Museum in [[Alford, Aberdeenshire]].

==Churches==
Like most Scottish burghs, Aberdeen has many churches, however, in the [[Middle Ages]] there was only one burgh kirk, St Nicholas, one of [[Scotland]]'s largest parish churches.  Like a number of other Scottish kirks, it was subdivided after the [[Reformation]], in this case into the East and West churches.

The large kirkyard of [[St Nicholas' Kirk, Aberdeen|St Nicholas' Kirk]] is separated from Union Street by a 147 ft (45 m) long Ionic facade, built in 1830.  The divided church within, with a central tower and spire, forms one continuous building, 220 ft (67 m) in length. It contains the Drum Aisle (the ancient burial-place of the Irvines of [[Drum Castle]]) and the Collison Aisle, which divide the two congregations and which formed the [[transept]]s of the [[12th-century]] church of St Nicholas (architectural detail survives from this period). The West Church was built in 1775, in the [[Palladian|Italian style]], on the site of the medieval [[nave]], the East originally in 1834 in Gothic-revival style on the site of the [[choir]]. In 1874 a fire destroyed the East Church and the old central tower with its fine peal of nine [[bell (instrument)|bells]], one of which, Laurence or &quot;Lowrie&quot;, was 4 ft (1.2 m) in diameter at the mouth, 3.5 ft (1.1 m) high and very thick. The church was rebuilt and a massive granite tower erected over the intervening aisles, a new peal of 36 bells, cast in the [[Netherlands]], being installed to commemorate the [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victorian]] [[Golden Jubilee|jubilee]] of 1887. These were replaced in 1950 with a carillion of 48 bells, the largest in the [[United Kingdom]].

The [[Diocese]] of Aberdeen is said to have been first founded at Mortlach in [[Banffshire]] by [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]] (1005-34) to celebrate his victory there over the Danes, but in 1137 [[David I of Scotland|David I]] (1124-53) transferred the [[bishopric]] to Old Aberdeen, and twenty years later [[St Machar's Cathedral]], situated a few hundred yards from the Don, was begun. Save during the episcopate of [[William Elphinstone]] ([[1484]]-[[1511]]), the building progressed slowly.  Gavin Dunbar, who followed him in 1518, completed the structure by adding the two western spires and the southern transept.  The church suffered severely at the [[Reformation]], but is still used by the [[Church of Scotland]] as a parish church.  The choir was abandoned to decay and the central tower collapsed in the course of the [[17th century]].  It now consists of the nave and the two-storeyed entrance porch (the former in use as the parish church) and the lower walls of the transepts.  These are under the care of [[Historic Scotland]], and contain an important group of late [[medieval]] bishops' tombs, protected from the weather by modern canopies.  The Cathedral is chiefly built of outlayer granite, and, though one of the plainest cathedrals in Scotland, its stately simplicity and severe symmetry lend it unique distinction.  On the unique flat panelled ceiling of the nave (first half of the [[16th century]]) are the heraldic shields of the contemporary kings of Europe, and the chief earls and bishops of [[Scotland]].  The great west window contains modern painted glass of excellent colour and design.  The Cathedral contains a number of well-preserved grave-monuments to the late medieval clergy, a rare [[Romanesque]] cross-head and an early Christian cross-slab from Seaton.

In the [[Middle Ages]], Aberdeen contained houses of the [[Carmelites]] ([[Whitefriars]]) and [[Franciscans]] ([[Greyfriars]]), the latter surviving in modified form as the chapel of [[Marischal College]] as late as the early [[20th century]].  No remains above ground.

[[St. Mary's Cathedral, Aberdeen|St. Mary's Cathedral]] is the [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral.  A [[Gothic style|Gothic]] building, it was erected in 1859. 

[[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Aberdeen|St. Andrew's Cathedral]] is the [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Scottish Episcopal]] cathedral.  The Episcopal Church in Aberdeen is notable for having consecrated the first bishop of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], [[Samuel Seabury]] ([http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/282.html Web Link]). The cathedral was rennovated in the [[1930s]] to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Seabury's consecration. The memorial was dedicated with a ceremony attended by the then U.S. ambassador to the UK, [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr]].

The cemeteries are St Peter's in Old Aberdeen, Trinity near the links, Nellfield at the junction of Great Western and Holburn Roads, Allenvale, adjoining Duthie Park and the most recent Facilities at Dyce.  There is also a crematorium and cemetery near Hazlehead.

==Education==
The first of Aberdeen's two universities, [[King's College]], was founded in 1495 by [[William Elphinstone]] (1431-1514), [[Bishop of Aberdeen]] and Chancellor of Scotland.  [[Marischal College]] was founded in New Aberdeen by George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal of [[Scotland]] in [[1593]].  These foundations were amalgamated to form the present [[University of Aberdeen]] in [[1860]].  King's and Marischal were [[Scotland]]'s third and fifth oldest universities respectively, and the fifth and seventh oldest in [[Britain]] as a whole.

[[Robert Gordon's College]] (originally Robert Gordon's Hospital) was founded in 1729 by the merchant [[Robert Gordon]], grandson of the map maker Robert Gordon of Straloch, and was further endowed in 1816 by Alexander Simpson of Collyhill.  Originally devoted to the instruction and maintenance of the sons of poor burgesses of guild and trade in the city, it was reorganized in 1881 as a day and night school for secondary and technical education, and in the 1990s became co-educational and a day-only school.  It also produced the Robert Gordon Institute of Technology, which in [[1992]] became [[The Robert Gordon University]].

[[Gray's School of Art]], founded in 1886, is one of the oldest established colleges of art in the UK.  It is situated in beautiful grounds at Garthdee on the edge of the city.  It is now incorporated into Robert Gordon University.

[[Aberdeen College]] has several campuses in Aberdeen and offers a wide variety of part-time and full-time courses leading to several different qualifications.  It the largest further education institution in Scotland.

[[Northern College]] was a [[teacher]] training college with campuses in Aberdeen and Dundee.  In 2000, the Aberdeen campus of Northern College became the University of Aberdeen School of Education.

[[Aberdeen Grammar School]], (now comprehensive, despite its name) founded in 1263 and one of the oldest schools in Britain, was removed in 1861-1863 from its old quarters in Schoolhill to a large new building, in the [[Scottish baronial style]], off Skene Street.  One famous alumnus of the Grammar School is [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]].

There are 12 secondary schools and 54 primary schools which are run by the city council in the city.  There are also a small number of private schools.  Albyn School for Girls (co-ed as of 2006) and St Margaret's girls school, both in the beautiful granite Queen's Road area just West of the city centre, are two of the better private schools in Scotland.  There's also a small French-language school (one of the few in Britain) catering to the oil industry families, an &quot;IB&quot; International school, and a Steiner school.

At [[Blairs]], in [[Kincardineshire]], five miles (8 km) S.W. of Aberdeen, is St Mary's Roman Catholic College, currently ([[2006]]) disused, built for the training of young men intended for the priesthood, with plans to turn it into a hotel.

==Culture==
[[Image:Playhouseaberdeen.jpg|thumb|250px|left|His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen.]]
The city is blessed with amenities which cover a wide range of cultural activities and boasts a selection of museums. The Aberdeen Art Gallery houses a collection of Impressionist, Victorian, Scottish and 20th Century British paintings as well as collections of silver and glass. It also includes The Alexander Macdonald Bequest, a collection of late 19th century works donated by the museum's first benefactor and a constantly changing collection of contemporary work and regular visiting exhibitions.

The Aberdeen Maritime Museum, located in Shiprow, tells the story of Aberdeen's links with the sea from the days of sail and clipper ships to the latest oil and gas exploration technology. The museum includes a range of interactive exhibits and models, including an 8.5m (28 feet) high model of the Murchison oil production platform and a 19th Century assembly taken from Rattray Head lighthouse.

Provost Ross' House is the second oldest dwelling house in the city. It was built in 1593 and became the residence of Provost John Ross of Arnage in 1702. The house retains some original medieval features, including a kitchen, fire places and beam-and-board ceilings. The Gordon Highlanders Regimental Museum tells the story of one of Scotland's best known regiments. 

The Marischal Museum holds the principal collections of the University of Aberdeen, comprising some 80,000 items in the areas of fine art, Scottish history &amp; archaeology, and European, Mediterranean &amp; Near Eastern archaeology. The museum is open to the public, but also provides an important resource for the University's students and researchers. The permanent displays and reference collections are augmented by regular temporary exhibitions.

==Parks and open spaces==
'''Duthie Park''' 50 acres (202,000 m²)), situated on Riverside Drive, was named after and gifted to the city by Miss Elizabeth Crombie Duthie of Ruthrieston in 1881 and opened by Princess Beatrice on [[27 September]] [[1883]]. It  
occupies an excellent site on the north bank of the Dee and includes extensive gardens, a rose hill, boating pond, bandstand, and play area as well as the David Welch Winter Gardens. First opened in 1899, the Winter Gardens were rebuilt in 1970 following storm damage and extended. They are Europe's largest indoor gardens and one of the most visited in Scotland.

'''Victoria Park''' 13 acres (53,000 m²) opened in 1871, is a beautiful park situated in the north-western area. There is a conservatory used as a seating area and a fountain made of 14 different granites, presented to the people by the granite polishers and master builders of Aberdeen.

'''Westburn Park''' 13 acres (53,000 m²) opposite Victoria Park, caters for football and tennis, has a children's cycle track and a play area. An open section of the Westburn runs through the park.

'''Stewart Park''' (15 acres (61,000 m²) opened in 1894. The park was named after a former Lord Provost of the city, Sir David Stewart; a section is reserved for [[cricket]] and [[football (soccer)|football]].

'''Hazlehead Park''' is a large, heavily wooded park on the outskirts of the city. It is popular with sports enthusiasts, walkers, naturalists and picnickers. Around the park are football pitches, two golf courses, pitch and putt course, a horseriding school and woods for walking. The park has a significant collection of sculpture by a range of artists and heritage items which have been rescued from various places within the city. It also features Scotland's oldest maze, first planted in 1938.

'''Aberdeen Beach/Queen's Links''' is a well-loved and extremely popular recreational area of the city, visited by holidaymakers and city residents all year round. The area is well provided with sporting and recreational facilities, including the Beach Leisure Centre and the Lynx Ice Arena, cafes, restaurants, a fun fair, a multiplex cinema, a nightclub and other attractions.

'''Johnston Gardens''' is also a great park worth visiting. Situated behind Queen's Road and just beside Nellfield Terrace. It hosts many different types of flowers and plants which have been renowned for their beauty. Johnston Gardens also won many 'Britain in Bloom' competitions. Aberdeen itself has won the title of best city 'In Bloom' for 9 nine years in a row.

'''Seaton Park''' (270,000 m²) is located in the north of the city and was purchased by the Council in 1947 from Major Hay. Beside the park's south gates stands St Machar's Cathedral. There are flowerbeds and a walled garden beside the old stables, which have been converted for housing. The Cathedral Walk is always a resplendent sight in midsummer and one of the most popular with visitors to the city. Seaton Park is also an access point for the River Don and there is a walk from the park to the city boundary.

'''[[Union Terrace Gardens]]''' forms a popular rendezvous location in the heart of the city.

==Statues==
Adjacent to [[Union Terrace Gardens]] stands a colossal bronze statue of [[William Wallace]], by W. G. Stevenson. Also nearby these same gardens are a bronze statue of [[Robert Burns]] and [[Charles Marochetti]]'s seated figure of [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]].

In front of Robert Gordon's College is the bronze statue, by T. S. Burnett, of [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]]. At the head of Queen's Road stands the bronze statue of Queen Victoria, erected in 1893 by the royal tradesmen of the city. Near the Cross stands the granite statue of George Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon.

There is a 70 ft (21 m) high [[obelisk]] of [[Peterhead]] granite, originally erected in the square of Marischal College, to the memory of Sir James McGrigor (1778-1851), the military surgeon and director-general of the Army Medical Department, who was thrice elected lord [[rector]] of the College. In the [[1890s]] when the College was extended, the obelisk was moved to the Duthie Park.There is also a statue commemorating Lord Byron in Aberdeen Grammar School in the front grounds.

==Bridges==
The Dee is crossed by a number of bridges, from west to east:
*Bridge of Dee
*King George VI Bridge
*Railway bridge
*Wellington Suspension Bridge
*Queen Elizabeth II Bridge
*Victoria Bridge

Until 1832, the only access to the city from the south was the Bridge of Dee. It consists of seven semicircular ribbed arches, is about 30 ft (10 m) high, and was built early in the [[16th century]] by Bishops Elphinstone and Dunbar. It was nearly all rebuilt 1718-1723, and in 1842 was widened from 14 to 26 ft (4 to 8 m). This was the site of a battle in 1639 between the Royalists under Viscount Aboyne and the Covenanters who were led by the Marquis of Montrose.

The Bridge of Don has five granite arches, each 75 ft (23 m) in span, and was built 1827-1832. A little to the west is the Auld [[Brig o' Balgownie]], a picturesque single arch spanning the deep black stream, said to have been built by [[Robert I of Scotland|King Robert I]], and celebrated by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron]] in the tenth canto of &quot;[[Don Juan]]&quot;.

==Harbour==
[[Image:Aberdeen Harbour.jpg|thumb|right|A ship in Aberdeen Harbour.]]
Aberdeen Harbour is the principal commercial port in northern Scotland and an international port for general cargo, roll-on/roll-off and container traffic. 

Originally, the defective harbour, with a shallow sand and gravel bar at its entrance, retarded the trade of Aberdeen, but under various acts since 1773 it was greatly deepened. The north pier, built partly by [[John Smeaton]] [[1770s|1775-1781]], and partly by [[Thomas Telford]]  [[1810s|1810-1815]], extends nearly 3,000 ft (1000 m) into the [[North Sea]] and raised the bar. A wet dock of 29 acres (117,000 m²) and with 6000 ft (1800 m) of quay, was completed in 1848 and called Victoria Dock in honour of the queen's visit to the city in that year. Adjoining it is the Upper Dock. By the [[Harbour Act of 1868]], the Dee near the harbour was diverted from the south at a cost of £80,000, and 90 acres (364,000 m²) of new ground, in addition to 25 acres (101,000 m²) formerly made up, were provided on the north side of the river for the Albert Basin (with a graving dock), quays and warehouses. A 1050 ft (320 m) long concrete [[breakwater]] was constructed on the south side of the stream as a protection against south-easterly gales. On Girdleness, the southern point of the bay, a [[lighthouse]] was built in 1833. Thirty-two people were drowned in the harbour on [[5 April]] [[1876]], in the [[River Dee Ferry Boat Disaster]]. Aberdeen Harbour was the first publicly limited company in the United Kingdom. A harbour in [[Hong Kong]] has been named [[Aberdeen Harbour]], supposedly by ex-patriots from the Scottish city.

==Industry==
Owing to the variety and importance of its chief industries Aberdeen is one of the most prosperous cities in Scotland. Very durable grey granite was [[quarry|quarried]] at Rubislaw quarry for more than 300 years, and blocked and dressed paving &quot;setts&quot;, kerb and building stones, and monumental and other ornamental work of granite have long been exported from the district to all parts of the world. Quarrying finally ceased in 1971.

This, though once the predominant industry, was surpassed by the deep-sea fisheries, which derived a great impetus from improved technologies throughout the twentieth century. Lately, however, catches have fallen due to overfishing in previous years, and the use of the harbour by oil support vessels. Aberdeen remains an important fishing port, but the catch landed there is now eclipsed by the more northerly ports of [[Peterhead]] and [[Fraserburgh]]. The [[Fisheries Research Service]] is based in Aberdeen, including its headquarters and a marine research lab.

Most of the leading pre-1970s industries date from the [[18th century]], amongst them [[wool]]lens (1703), [[linen]] (1749), and [[cotton]] (1779). These gave employment to several thousands of operatives. The [[paper]]-making industry is one of the most famous and oldest in the city, paper having been first made in Aberdeen in 1694. [[Flax]]-[[spinning]] and [[jute]] and [[comb]]making factories also flourished, along with successful [[foundry|foundries]] and engineering works.

In the days of wooden ships [[ship-building]] was a flourishing industry, the town being noted for its fast [[clipper]]s, many of which established records in the &quot;[[tea]] races&quot;. The introduction of trawling revived this to some extent, and despite the distance of the city from the [[iron]] fields there was a fair yearly output of iron vessels. The last major shipbuilder in Aberdeen, Hall Russells, closed in the late 1980's.

With the discovery of significant oil deposits in the North Sea during the late [[twentieth century]], Aberdeen became the centre of [[Europe]]'s [[petroleum]] industry, with the port serving [[oil rig]]s off-shore. The number of jobs created by the energy industry in and around Aberdeen has been estimated at half a million. In 1988, the city was dealt a heavy blow by the loss-of-life suffered during an explosion and fire aboard one such rig, the [[Piper Alpha]].

==Population==
In 1396 the population was about 3,000. By 1801 it had become 26,992; in 1841 it was 63,262; (1891) 121,623; (1901) 153,503; in 2001 it was 197,328.

==Sport==
[[Aberdeen Football Club]] was founded in 1903. Its major success was winning the [[European Cup Winners Cup]] in 1983 and three League Championships between 1980 and 1986, under the current [[Manchester United F.C.]] manager [[Alex Ferguson]]. The club's stadium is [[Pittodrie]] which holds the distinction of being Britain's first all-seater stadium. 

Aberdeen F.C. holds the distinction of being the last team to have won the [[Scottish Premier League]] Championship outside the [[Old Firm]] and is the only Scottish team to have won two European trophies adding to their European Cup Winners Cup success by winning the [[European Super Cup]] also in 1983. 

Well known footballers who have played for the club include [[Gordon Strachan]] (Current Celtic manager), [[Alex McLeish]] (Current Rangers manager) and club legend [[Willie Miller]]. [[Denis Law]], the joint top scorer for the Scotland national team was also born in the city, but spent his professional career playing for English and Italian clubs.

Aberdeen Golf Club was founded in 1815. It has two 18-hole courses at Balgownie, north of the River Don. There are other golf courses at Auchmill, Balnagask, Hazlehead and King's Links.

==Transport==

There are four main roads serving the city; 

* [[A90 road|A90]] The main arterial route into the city from the South, linking Aberdeen to [[Edinburgh]], [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].  
* [[A96 road|A96]] Links to [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] and [[Inverness]] and the North West.
* [[A93 road|A93]] The main route to the West, heading towards [[Royal Deeside]] and the [[Cairngorms]].
* [[A92 road|A92]] The original southerly road to Aberdeen prior to the building of the A90, now used as a tourist route, connecting the towns of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], [[Arbroath]] and [[Brechin]] on the east coast.

The city's original ring road, Anderson Drive, which was built in the 1930s has long since been engulfed by the expansion of the city, and is inadequate for dealing with today's traffic.  To this end, a new main bypass road, the Western Peripheral Route, is planned to divert through traffic away from the city centre. The road is due to open in 2010. 

The city is well served by the national [[railway]] network.  Aberdeen has regular rail services to [[Glasgow]] and Edinburgh as well as long distance trains to [[London]] via Edinburgh. It is possible to take the longest scheduled rail journey in the whole of the UK from Aberdeen. A daily service runs from Aberdeen to [[Penzance]] in [[Cornwall]], which is 722 miles (1,162 km) and twelve and three quarter hours away. Regular trains also run north westerly towards Inverness and north to [[Dyce]] for the airport.

Aberdeen also has an [[airport]] in the neighbouring town of Dyce, which is operated by [[BAA plc]]. As well as connecting the city to the rest of the UK, [[Aberdeen Airport]] (sometimes refererred to as ''Dyce Airport'') is the largest [[helicopter]] terminal in the world, serving the many North Sea oil installations. The [[IATA airport code]] for the airport is ABZ.
