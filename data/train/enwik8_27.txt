      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Artistic License''' is a software [[license]] used for certain [[free software]] packages, most notably the standard [[Perl]] implementation, most of [[CPAN]] modules and [[Parrot virtual machine|Parrot]], which are [[dual-licensed]] under the Artistic License and the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).

It was written by [[Larry Wall]].

Whether or not the original Artistic License is a [[free software license]] is largely undecided.  It is often heavily criticised for being ambiguous, self-contradictory, and thus virtually impossible to interpret.  [[Free Software Foundation]] have gone so far to say that it is ''not'' a free software license, however, this has never been a contentious issue since all notable software that uses the original Artistic License are [[dual licensed]] along with the GPL.

There exists an '''Artistic License 2.0''', which was written in response to a Perl community [[request for comments]], which everyone agrees is a free software license.  The license was written by [[Bradley Kuhn]], then working for Free Software Foundation, and seems to be scheduled for adoption by the standard Perl implementation when version 6 is released.  There also exists a &quot;Clarified Artistic License&quot;, which is also a free software license, currently being used by the [[SNEeSe]] and [[FakeNES]] [[emulators]].

The name of the licence is a reference to the concept of [[artistic licence]].

'''Afrikaans''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] mainly spoken in [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]] with smaller numbers of speakers in [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]. Due to the [[emigration]] of many White South Africans, there are an additional estimated 300,000 Afrikaans-speakers in the UK, with other substantial communities found in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Australia]]; [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]; and [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. It is the primary language used by two related ethnic groups: the [[Afrikaners]] (including [[Boers]]) and the [[Coloureds]] or ''kleurlinge''/''bruinmense'' (including [[Basters]], [[Cape Malays]] and [[Griqua]]). These two groups are collectively known as '''''Afrikaanses'''''&lt;!-- please STOP replacing Afrikaanses with Afrikaners or worse yet &quot;Afrikaaners&quot; --&gt;, roughly meaning &quot;the language community of Afrikaans-speakers&quot;. 

Many Afrikaans speakers do not consider themselves either Afrikaners or Coloureds, but simply Afrikaans-speaking South Africans. Geographically, the Afrikaans language is the majority language of the western one-third of South Africa ([[Northern Cape|Northern]] and [[Western Cape]], spoken at home by 69% and 58%, respectively). It is also the largest first language in the adjacent southern one-third of Namibia ([[Hardap]] and [[Karas]], where it is the first language of 43% and 41%, respectively). It is the most widely used second language throughout both of these countries for the population as a whole, although the younger generation has better proficiency in [[English language|English]].

The name ''Afrikaans'' is simply the Dutch word for ''African'', i.e. the African form of the Dutch language. The dialect became known as &quot;[[Cape Dutch]]&quot;. Later, Afrikaans was sometimes also referred to as &quot;African Dutch&quot; or &quot;Kitchen Dutch&quot;, although some now consider these terms [[pejorative]]. Afrikaans was considered a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] [[Dialect|dialect]] until the late [[19th century]], when it began to be recognised as a distinct language, and it gained equal status with Dutch and English as an official language in South Africa in 1925. But Dutch remained an official language until the new 1961 constitution finally stipulated that the two official languages in South Africa to be Afrikaans and English only (although, curiously, the 1961 constitution still had a sub-clause stipulating that the word &quot;Afrikaans&quot; was also meant to be referring to the Dutch language). But the 1925 decision has led practical Dutch to be in disuse and for it to be replaced by Afrikaans for all purposes.

There are basically three dialects, of which the [[Oosgrens-Afrikaans|northeastern variant]] (which developed into a literary language in the [[Transvaal]]) forms the basis of the [[orthography|written standard]]. Within the Dutch-speaking zones of the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Suriname]], there is greater divergence among the dialects than there is between standard Dutch and standard Afrikaans.

It was originally the dialect that developed among the [[Afrikaner]] [[Protestant]] [[settler]]s and the indentured or [[slavery|slave]] workforce brought to the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] area in southwestern South Africa by the [[Dutch East India Company]] ([[Dutch language]]: ''Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie'' - VOC) between [[1652]] and [[1705]]. A relative majority of these first settlers were from the [[Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands|United Provinces]] (now [[Netherlands]]), though there were also many from [[Germany]], a considerable number from [[France]], some from [[Portugal]], a few from [[Scotland]], and various other countries. The indentured workers and slaves were [[South Indian]]s, [[Malay people|Malay]]s, and [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] in addition to the indigenous [[Khoi]] and [[Bushmen]].


== History ==
Afrikaans is [[linguistics|linguistically]] closely related to [[17th century]]/[[18th century]] Dutch dialects spoken in North and South [[Holland]] and, by extension, to modern Dutch. Today, speakers of each language can today make themselves fairly easily understood by speakers of the other. Some find the accents associated with Dutch or Flemish to be softer than Afrikaans (which is sometimes described as guttural), but there is no general agreement on this, with some Afrikaans speakers experiencing Dutch accents as harsh.

Afrikaans grammar and spelling is simpler than that of Dutch, in the same sense and to approximately the same degree that English grammar is simpler than German grammar. Afrikaans also has a more diverse vocabulary, including words of English, Indian, Malay, Malagasy, Khoi, San and Bantu origins. Other closely related languages include [[Low German]] spoken in northern Germany and the Netherlands, [[German language|German]], and [[English language|English]]. Cape Dutch vocabulary diverged from the Dutch vocabulary spoken in the Netherlands over time as Cape Dutch absorbed words from other European [[settler]]s, slaves from East India and Indonesia's [[Malay people|Malay]], and native African languages. Research by [[J. A. Heese]] indicates that until [[1807]], 36.8% of the ancestors of the White Afrikaans speaking population were Dutch, 35% were German, 14.6% were French and 7.2% non-white (of African and/or Asian origins). Heese's figures are questioned by other researchers, however, and especially the non-white component quoted by Heese is very much in doubt.

The linguist Paul Roberge suggests that the earliest 'truly &quot;Afrikaans&quot;' texts are doggerel verse from 1795 and a dialogue transcribed by a Dutch traveller in 1825. Printed material among the Afrikaners at first used only proper European Dutch. By the mid-19th century, more and more was appearing in Afrikaans, which was very much still regarded as a set of spoken regional dialects. The first Afrikaans grammars and dictionaries were published in [[1875]] by the ''[[Genootskap vir Regte Afrikaners]]'' (Society for Real Afrikaners) in [[Cape Town]]. The [[Boer Wars]] further strengthened the position of the new Dutch-like language. The [[official language]]s of the Union of South Africa were English and Dutch until 1925 when Afrikaans replaced Dutch.

Besides vocabulary, the most striking difference from Dutch is its much more regular grammar, which is likely the result of extensive contact with one or more [[Creole language|creole languages]] based on the Dutch language spoken by the relatively large number of non-Dutch speakers ([[Khoikhoi language|Khoikhoi]], German, French, [[Cape Malays|Cape Malay]], and speakers of different African languages) during the formation period of the language in the second half of the 17th century. In 1710, slaves outnumbered free settlers, and the language was developing among speakers who had little occasion to write or analyse their new dialect.

There are many different theories about how Afrikaans came to be. The Afrikaans School has long seen Afrikaans as a natural development from the South-Hollandic Dutch dialect, but has also only considered the Afrikaans as spoken by the Whites. The Afrikaans School has also rejected all alternative ideas.

Most linguistics scholars today are certain that Afrikaans has been influenced by [[Creole language|creole languages]] based on the South-Holland Dutch dialect. It is very hard to find out how this influence took place, since there is almost no material written in the Dutch-based creole languages: only a few sentences found in unrelated books often written by non-speakers.

Although much of the vocabulary of Afrikaans reflects its origins in 17th century South-Hollandic Dutch, it also contains words borrowed from Asian [[Malay language|Malay]] (the oldest known written Afrikaans uses Arabic script and was intended for use among Cape Town's Muslims), [[Malagasy language|Malagasy Malay]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], [[Khoisan languages|Khoi and San dialects]], [[English language|English]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and many other languages. Consequently, many words in Afrikaans are very different from Dutch, as demonstrated by the names of different fruits: 
{| cellspacing=&quot;7px&quot;
|-
| '''AFRIKAANS''' || '''DUTCH''' || '''ENGLISH'''
|-
| piesang* || banaan || banana
|-
| lemoen || sinaasappel || orange
|-
| suurlemoen** || citroen || lemon
|}

&lt;br /&gt;* from Malay ''pisang'' (a word that is known to the Dutch through their [[Dutch East Indies]] history)
&lt;br /&gt;** suur = sour (which is essentially the same as the Dutch word 'zuur').&lt;br&gt;
(''Pisang'' is also a lesser used Dutch word for ''banana'')

== Grammar ==

''See separate article on [[Afrikaans grammar]]''.

==Orthography==
Written Afrikaans differs from Dutch in that the spelling reflects a phonetically simplified language, and so many consonants are dropped (see also the grammar section  for a description of how consonant dropping affects the morphology of Afrikaans adjectives and nouns). The spelling is also considerably more phonetical than the Dutch counterpart. A notable feature is the indefinite article, which, as noted in the grammar section, is &quot;'n&quot;, not &quot;een&quot; as in Dutch. &quot;A book&quot; is &quot;'n Boek&quot;, whereas in Dutch it would be &quot;Een boek&quot;. (Note that &quot;'n&quot; is still allowed in Dutch; Afrikaans uses only &quot;'n&quot; where Dutch uses it next to &quot;een&quot;. When letters are dropped an apostrophe is mandatory.)  Other features include the use of 's' instead of 'z', hence South Africa in Afrikaans is written as ''Suid-Afrika'', whereas in Dutch it is ''Zuid-Afrika''. (This accounts for [[.za]] being used as South Africa's [[List of Internet TLDs|internet top level domain]].) The Dutch letter 'IJ' is written as 'Y', except where it replaces the Dutch [[suffix]] ''-lijk'', as in ''waarschijnlijk = waarskynlik''. Interesting to note that the use of the hard &quot;k&quot; is analogous to the pronunciation in parts of Flanders, which was once part of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], and from whence many an [[Afrikaner]] came. Also surprising for many Dutch is the double negative, which could possibly be attributed to the French origins of many Afrikaners: ''Nie rook nie'' - No smoking; compare to the French &quot;Ne pas fumer&quot;.

== Sociolinguistics ==
Afrikaans is the first language of approximately 60% of South Africa's [[Whites]], and over 90% of the &quot;[[Coloured]]&quot; (mixed-race) population. Large numbers of blacks, [[Asians in South Africa|Indians]], and English-speaking whites also speak it as a second language. 

It is also widely spoken in [[Namibia]], where it has had constitutional recognition as a national, not official, language since independence in [[1990]]. Prior to independence, Afrikaans, along with German, had equal status as an official language. There is a much smaller number of Afrikaans speakers among [[Zimbabwe]]'s white minority, but most left the country in [[1980]]. 

Many South Africans living and working in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] are also Afrikaans speakers. 

Afrikaans has been influential in the development of [[South African English]]. Many Afrikaans loanwords have found their way into South African English, such as  &quot;veld&quot;, &quot;[[braai]]&quot;, &quot;boomslang&quot;, and &quot;lekker&quot;. A few words in standard English are derived from Afrikaans, such as &quot;[[trek]]&quot;, &quot;spoor&quot;, and, of course, [[apartheid]]. 

In [[1976]], high school students in [[Soweto]] began the rebellion that contributed to the end of [[apartheid]] and the whites-only government of [[South Africa]].  This has been credited to that government's decision that Afrikaans rather than English be used as the language of instruction in non-White schools. However, many historians argue that the language issue was a catalyst for the rebellion rather than the major underlying cause (which was racial oppression). Afrikaans is more widely spoken than English (and is, in fact, spoken by a majority of residents in two of South Africa's nine provinces), so most children may not have objected to the use of Afrikaans per se. Rather, it was the further directive, within the instructional language directive, that non-White (i.e., Black, Coloured and Indian) South African children be denied instruction in all but the most basic topics of mathematics, sciences, fine arts, etc., on the theory they would never need to know those subjects because they would never have the occasion to use such an education. ''See [[History of South Africa]].''

Under South Africa's multiracial [[Constitution]] of [[1994]], Afrikaans remains an official language, but there are now nine other official languages, in addition to English, with which it has equal status. The new dispensation means that Afrikaans is often downgraded in favour of English, or to accommodate the other official languages.  In [[1996]], for example, the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] reduced the amount of [[television]] airtime in Afrikaans, while  [[South African Airways]] dropped its Afrikaans name ''Suid-Afrikaanse Lugdiens'' from its livery. Similarly, South Africa's [[diplomatic mission]]s overseas now only display the name of the country in English and their host country's language, but not in Afrikaans.  

Although these moves have angered many Afrikaans speakers, the language has remained strong, with Afrikaans newspapers and magazines continuing to have large circulation figures. Indeed the [[Huisgenoot]], an Afrikaans language general interest family magazine, is the magazine with the largest readership in the country. In addition, a pay-TV channel in Afrikaans called [[KykNet]] was launched in [[1999]] and an Afrikaans music channel, [[MK89]], in [[2005]]. A large number of Afrikaans books also continue to be published every year.

Although Afrikaans has diverged from Dutch over the past three centuries, it still shares 85 per cent of its vocabulary with that language, and Afrikaans speakers are able to learn Dutch within a comparatively short period of time. Native Dutch speakers pick up Afrikaans even more quickly, due to its simplified grammar. This has enabled Dutch companies to outsource their [[call centre]] operations to South Africa, thereby taking advantage of lower labour costs.

Outside of South Africa, the Afrikaans language is sometimes regarded with contempt. However, when the British design magazine [[Wallpaper*]] described Afrikaans as 'the ugliest language in the world', South African [[billionaire]] [[Johann Rupert]], responded by withdrawing advertising for brands such as  [[Cartier SA|Cartier]], [[Van Cleef &amp; Arpels]], [[Montblanc (pens)|Montblanc]] and [[Alfred Dunhill, Ltd.|Alfred Dunhill]] from the magazine [http://business.iafrica.com/news/657706.htm]. The author of the article, Bronwyn Davies, was in fact a South African.

== Afrikaans phrases ==
{{IPA notice}}

Afrikaans is a very centralised language, meaning that most of the vowels are pronounced in a very centralised (i.e. very schwa-like) way. There are a lot of different dialects and different pronunciations — but the transcription should be fairly standard.

* '''Hallo! Hoe gaan dit?'''  {{IPA|[&amp;#614;al&amp;#601;u &amp;#614;u xa&amp;#721;n d&amp;#601;t]}} Hello! How are you? 
* '''Baie goed, dankie.'''  {{IPA|[baj&amp;#601; xu&amp;#721;t danki]}} Very good, thanks.
* '''Praat jy Afrikaans?''' {{IPA|[pr&amp;#593;&amp;#721;t j&amp;#601;i afrik&amp;#593;&amp;#721;ns]}} Do you speak Afrikaans?
* '''Praat jy Engels?''' {{IPA|[pr&amp;#593;&amp;#721;t j&amp;#601;i &amp;#603;&amp;#331;&amp;#601;ls]}} Do you speak English?
* '''Ja.''' {{IPA|[j&amp;#593;&amp;#721;]}} Yes.
* '''Nee.''' {{IPA|[ne&amp;#721;&amp;#601;]}} No.
* ''''n Bietjie.''' {{IPA|[&amp;#601; biki]}} A little.
* '''Wat is jou naam?''' {{IPA|[vat &amp;#601;s j&amp;#601;u n&amp;#593;&amp;#721;m]}} What is your name?
* '''Die kinders praat Afrikaans''' {{IPA|[di k&amp;#601;n&amp;#601;rs pr&amp;#593;&amp;#721;t afrik&amp;#593;&amp;#721;ns]}} The children speak Afrikaans.

Two interesting sentences having the same meaning and written (but not pronounced) identically in Afrikaans and English are:
*'''My pen was in my hand''' ({{IPA|[m&amp;#601;i p&amp;#603;n vas &amp;#601;n m&amp;#601;i h&amp;#593;nt]}})
*'''My hand is in warm water.''' ({{IPA|[m&amp;#601;i h&amp;#593;nt &amp;#601;s &amp;#601;n var&amp;#601;m v&amp;#593;&amp;#721;t&amp;#601;r]}})

== Additional information ==

* Afrikaans has a monument erected in its honour.  The [[Afrikaans Language Monument]] (''Afrikaanse Taalmonument'') is located near the Western Cape Province town of [[Paarl]].
* The letters ''c, q'' and ''x'' are rarely seen in Afrikaans, and words containing them are almost exclusively borrowings from English, Greek or Latin. This is usually because words with ''c'' or ''ch'' in Dutch are [[transliteration|transliterated]] as ''k'' or ''g'' in Afrikaans. Similarly ''q'' and ''x'' are usually transliterated as ''kw'' and ''ks'', for example &quot;equatorial&quot; becomes ''ekwatoriaal'' and &quot;excuse&quot; becomes ''ekskuus''.
* Special letters used are ''è, é, ê, ë, î, ï, ô, û''. Sometimes ''ŉ'' is considered a single character.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aiolos''' ({{polytonic|&amp;Alpha;&amp;#7988;&amp;omicron;&amp;lambda;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;}}), [[Latin]]ized as '''Aeolus''', '''Eolus''', '''Aeolos''', or '''Aiolus''', was the name of three personages in [[Greek Mythology]].  These three personages are often difficult to tell apart, and even the ancient mythographers appear to have been perplexed about which Aeolus was which.  Diodorus made an attempt to define each of these three (although it is clear he also became muddled), and his opinion is followed here.  Briefly, the first Aeolus was a son of [[Hellen]] and founder of the Aeolian race; the second was a son of [[Poseidon]], who led a colony to the Tyrrhenian sea; and the third Aeolus was a son of [[Hippotes]] who is mentioned in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' as Keeper of the [[Anemoi|Winds]] in [[Greek Mythology]].  All three men named Aeolus appear to be connected genealogically, although the precise relationship is often ambiguous.  The traditions regarding the second and third Aeolus are especially entangled.

==Aeolus (son of Hellen)==

This '''Aeolus''' was son of Hellen and the nymph Orseis, and a brother of [[Dorus]], [[Xuthus]] and [[Amphictyon]].  He is described as the ruler of [[Aeolia]] (later called [[Thessaly]]) and held to be the founder of the [[Aeolic]] branch of the Greek/Hellenic nation.  Aeolus married [[Enarete]], daughter of Deimachus (otherwise unknown).  Aeolus and Enarete had many children, although the precise number and identities of these children vary from author to author in the ancient sources.  Those listed as the sons of Aeolus and Enarate include [[Cretheus]], [[Sisyphus]], [[Deioneus]], [[Salmoneus]], [[Athamas]], [[Perieres]], [[Cercaphas]] and perhaps [[Magnes]] (who is usually regarded as a brother of [[Macedon]]).  Another son is named [[Mimas]], who provides a link to the third Aeolus (see below) in a genealogy that seems very contrived.  [[Calyce]], [[Peisidice]], [[Perimele]] and [[Alcyone]] were counted among the daughters of Aeolus and Enarate.  This [[Aeolus]] also had an illegitimate daughter named [[Arne]], begotten on [[Melanippe]], daughter of the Centaur [[Cheiron]].  This Arne became the mother of the second Aeolus, by the god Poseidon.

==Aeolus (son of Poseidon)==

This '''Aeolus''' was a son of Poseidon by Arne, daughter of Aeolus.  He had a twin brother named [[Boeotus]].  Arne confessed to her father that she was with child by the god Poseidon; Aeolus, however, did not believe her, and handed her over to a man named [[Metapontus]], King of Icaria.  When Boeotus and Aeo­lus were born, they were raised by Meta­pontus; but their stepmother ([[Autolyte]], wife of Metapontus) quarrelled with their mother Arne, prompting Boeotus and Aeolus to kill Autolyte and flee from Icaria.  Boeotus (accompanied by Arne) went to southern Thessaly, and founded [[Boeotia]]; but Aeolus went to a group of islands in the Tyrrhenian sea, which received from him the name of the [[Aeolian Islands]]; accord­ing to some accounts this Aeolus founded the town of Lipara.  Although his home has been traditionally identified as one of the Aeolian Islands (there is little consensus as to which), near [[Sicily]], an alternative location has been suggested at [[Gramvousa]] off the northwest coast of [[Crete]].  Aeolus had six sons and six daughters, and the family lived happily together - that is until the day Aeolus learned that one of his sons, named [[Macareus]], had committed incest with his sister [[Canace]].  Horrified, Aeolus expelled Macareus (Canace killed herself in shame) and threw the child borne of this incestuous union to the dogs.  (Other accounts claim that the child, a daughter named [[Amphissa]]) was rescued and later beloved by [[Apollo]]).

==Aeolus (son of Hippotes)==

This '''Aeolus''' is most frequently conflated with Aeolus, the son of Poseidon.  It is difficult to delineate this Aeolus from the second Aeolus, as their identities seem to have been merged by many ancient writers.  The father of this third Aeolus is given as Mimas, a son of the first Aeolus (son of Hellen).  According to some accounts, Mimas married the same Melanippe who was the mother of Arne!  This Aeolus lived on the floating island of [[Aeolia]] and was visited by [[Odysseus]] and his crew in the ''Odyssey.'' He gave hospitality for a month and provided for a west wind to carry them home.  Unfortunately he also provided a gift of a bag containing each of the four winds, which Odysseus's crew members opened just before their home was reached.  They were blown back to [[Aeolia]], where Aeolus refused to provide any further help. (''[[Odyssey]]'' X, 2; [[Virgil]] I, 52).  This Aeolus was perceived by later authors (i.e., after Homer) as a god, rather than as a mortal and simple Keeper of the Winds (as in the ''Odyssey'').

    <title>Alford plea</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the law of the [[United States]], an '''''Alford''''' '''plea''' is a [[plea]] in criminal court.  In this plea, the defendant does not admit the act and asserts innocence, but admits that sufficient evidence exists with which the prosecution could likely convince a judge or jury to find the defendant guilty.  Upon receiving an Alford plea from a defendant, the court may immediately pronounce the defendant guilty and impose [[sentence (law)|sentence]] as if the defendant had otherwise been convicted of the crime. However, in many states, such as Massachusetts, a plea which &quot;admits sufficient facts&quot; more typically results in the case being continued without a finding and later dismissed. It is the prospect of an ultimate dismissal of charges which engenders most pleas of this type.

The Alford plea differs slightly from the [[nolo contendere]] (&quot;no contest&quot;) plea.  An Alford plea is simply a form of a guilty plea, and, as with other guilty pleas, the judge must see there is some factual basis for the plea.  Therefore, a defendant's prior conviction via an Alford plea can be considered in future trials; and it will count as a &quot;strike&quot; if a [[three strikes law]] applies.  On the other hand, a nolo contendere plea is in no way an admission of guilt, and it cannot be introduced in future trials as evidence of [[incorrigibility]].  However, courts do not have to accept a plea of nolo contendere, and usually do not, except in certain nonviolent cases.

This plea originated in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case of [[North Carolina v. Alford]] ([[1970]]), [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=US&amp;vol=400&amp;invol=25 400 US 25]. Under subsequent case law, an ''Alford'' plea generally has the same effect as a plea of guilty with respect to sentencing, and use of the conviction as an aggravating factor if the defendant is later convicted of another offense. 

Some critics have spoken out against the ''nolo contendere'' and ''Alford'' pleas on the moral grounds that they undermine public confidence in the accuracy and fairness of the criminal justice system, sending some people to jail who are unrepentant or innocent; and that they dodge the &quot;morality play&quot; aspect of a criminal trial, in which upright civilization is vindicated and the community sees that the guilty are punished. Others see this as the major benefit of these pleas.

    <title>Anti-realism</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[philosophy]], the term '''anti-realism''' is used to describe any
position involving either the denial of the objective reality of entities of a certain type or the insistence that we should be [[agnosticism|agnostic]] about their real existence. Thus, we may speak of '''anti-realism''' with respect to other minds, the past, the future, [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], [[mathematics|mathematical entities]] (such as [[natural numbers]]), [[morality|moral categories]], the material world, or even thought.

The term was popularised by [[Michael Dummett]], who introduced it in
his paper ''Realism'' to re-examine several classical philosophical
disputes involving such doctrines as [[nominalism]], 
[[conceptual realism]], [[idealism]] and [[phenomenalism]]. The novelty of
Dummett's approach consisted in seeing these disputes as analogous to
the dispute between [[intuitionism (philosophy of mathematics)|intuitionism]] and [[Platonism]] in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

According to intuitionists (anti-realists with respect to mathematical objects), the [[truth]] of a mathematical statement consists in our ability to prove it. According to platonists ([[philosophical realism|realists]]), the truth of a statement consists in its correspondence to [[objective]] reality. Thus, intuitionists are ready to accept a statement of the form &quot;P or Q&quot; as true only if we can prove P or if we can prove Q:
this is called the [[disjunction property]]. In particular, we cannot in general claim that &quot;P or not P&quot; is true (the [[law of the excluded middle]]), since in some cases we may not be able either to prove nor disprove the statement P.  Similarly, intuitionistists object to the failure of the [[existence property]] for classical logic, where one can prove &lt;math&gt;\exists x.\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, without being able to produce any term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; of which &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;  holds.

Dummett argues that the intuitionistic notion of truth lies at the
bottom of various classical forms of '''anti-realism'''. He uses this
notion to re-interpret [[phenomenalism]], claiming that it need not
take the form of a [[reductionism]] (often considered untenable).

In [[philosophy of science]], anti-realism applies chiefly to claims about the non-reality of &quot;unobservable&quot; [[entity|entities]] such as [[electron]]s, which are not detectable with our normal human senses but which many nonetheless claim are real. For a brief discussion comparing such anti-realism to its opposite, realism, see (Okasha 2002, ch. 4). Ian Hacking (1999, p. 84) also uses the same definition.  The anti-realist position in the philosophy of science is often called [[Instrumentalism]], which takes a purely functionalist view of the existence of unobservable (or only indirectly observable) entities: X exists only to the same extent that it works within a theory Y, and nothing more useful may be said about it ontologically.

In discussions of [[art]] (including [[Visual arts and design|visual art]], writing, [[music]], and [[lyrics]]), '''anti-realism''' and '''anti-realist''' may be used in one of the philosophical senses described above, or may simply be used in contrast to [[realism (arts)|realism]], in whatever sense the latter is meant. Thus [[surrealism]] in visual art is an &quot;anti-realist&quot; tendency, and the [[psychedelic]] bands common in the United States in the [[1960s]] were &quot;anti-realist,&quot; etc. These terms may not be as precise when applied to art as when applied to philosophical matters.  '''Anti-reality''' is occasionally used in this sense, although it may be used in other senses.

'''Arsenal Football Club''' (also known as '''Arsenal''', '''The Arsenal''' or '''The Gunners''') are an [[England|English]] professional [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in north [[London]]. They play in the [[FA Premier League]] and are one of the most successful clubs in [[Football in England|England]]. Arsenal have won thirteen [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and Premier League titles, and the [[FA Cup]] ten times, although the team have yet to achieve similar success in the [[UEFA Champions League]].

Arsenal were founded in south-east London in [[1886 in sports|1886]], but moved to their current home ground, the [[Arsenal Stadium]], [[Highbury]], in [[1913 in sports|1913]]. In August [[2006 in sports|2006]] the club will move to the new 60,000-seat [[Emirates Stadium]] in nearby Ashburton Grove. Arsenal have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], from nearby [[Tottenham]], whom they play in the [[North London derby]].

==History==
{{details|History of Arsenal F.C.}}
&lt;!-- This section is meant to be just a summary. Please do not add too much detail - the [[History of Arsenal F.C.]] article is intended for detailed additions. --&gt;
Arsenal were founded as '''Dial Square''' in 1886 by workers at the [[Royal Arsenal]] in [[Woolwich]], but were renamed to '''Royal Arsenal''' shortly afterwards. They renamed themselves again to '''Woolwich Arsenal''' after turning professional in 1891. The club joined the [[Football League]] in 1893, starting out in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], and won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1904. However, the club's geographic isolation, and the resulting low attendances, led to the club becoming mired in financial problems. In 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, they moved across the [[River Thames|Thames]] to the new [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]], north London. They dropped &quot;Woolwich&quot; from their name the following year. Arsenal only finished in fifth place in 1919, but nevertheless were elected to rejoin the First Division at the expense of local rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], by reportedly dubious means.{{ref|henrynorris}}

In 1925, Arsenal appointed the highly successful [[Herbert Chapman]] as manager. Chapman had won the league with [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in 1924 and 1925, and he brought Arsenal their first period of major success. His revolutionary tactics and training, along with star players such as [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]] and [[Cliff Bastin]], laid the foundations of the club's domination of English football in the 1930s. Between 1930 and 1938, Arsenal won the First Division five times and the [[FA Cup]] twice, although Chapman did not live to see all of these achievements, as he died of [[pneumonia]] in 1934. In addition, Chapman was reportedly behind the 1932 renaming of the local [[London Underground]] station from &quot;Gillespie Road&quot; to &quot;[[Arsenal tube station|Arsenal]]&quot;, making it the only Tube station to be named after a football club.

Following the suspension of English professional football during [[World War II]], Arsenal won the league in 1948 and 1953 and the FA Cup in 1950. However, their fortunes began to wane; unable to attract players of the same calibre as they had in the '30s, the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in trophyless mediocrity. Even former [[England national football team|England]] captain [[Billy Wright (footballer)|Billy Wright]] could not bring the club any success as manager.

Arsenal's second successful era began with the surprise appointment of club [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] [[Bertie Mee]] as manager in 1966. After losing two [[League Cup]] finals, they won the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], their first European trophy, in 1970. This was followed by an even greater triumph: their first League and FA Cup [[the Double|double]] in 1971. However, the following decade was characterised by a series of near misses. Arsenal finished as First Division runners-up in 1973, lost three FA Cup finals (1972, 1978 and 1980) and lost the 1980 [[Cup Winners' Cup]] final on [[penalty shootout (football)|penalties]]. The club's only success during this time was an FA Cup win in 1979, with a last-minute 3–2 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] that is widely regarded as a classic.

[[Image:Arsenal open top bus parade 2004.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Arsenal's players and fans celebrate their 2004 title win with an open-top bus parade]]
The return of former player [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] as manager in 1986 brought a third period of glory. Arsenal won the League Cup in 1987, Graham's first season in charge. This was followed by a League title win in 1989, won with a last-minute goal in the final game of the season against fellow title challengers [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Graham's Arsenal won another title in 1991, losing only one match, the FA Cup and League Cup double in 1993 and a second European trophy, the [[Cup Winners' Cup]], in 1994. However, Graham's reputation was tarnished when it was revealed that he had taken kickbacks from agent [[Rune Hauge]] for signing certain players,{{ref|georgegraham}} and he was sacked in 1995. His replacement, [[Bruce Rioch]], lasted for only one season, leaving the club after a dispute over transfer funds.

The club's success in the late 1990s and 2000s owes a great deal to the appointment of manager [[Arsène Wenger]] in 1996. Wenger brought new tactics, a new training regime and several foreign players who complemented the existing English talent. Arsenal won a second league and cup double in 1998 and a third in 2002. In addition, the club were victorious in the 2003 and 2005 FA Cups, and won the League in 2004 without losing a single match; in all, the club went 49 league matches unbeaten, a [[Football records in England|record]]. Arsenal finished in either first or second place in the league in eight of Wenger's first nine seasons, and they are now considered to be one of the &quot;big three&quot; clubs in England along with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. However, they have been unable to replicate their domestic success in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], having never progressed beyond the quarter-finals (as of 2005).

==Crest==
[[Image:Arsenal crest 1888.png|thumb|160px|Arsenal's first crest from 1888]]  
[[Image:Arsenal_fc_old_crest_small.png|thumb|160px|Arsenal's crest from ''c.'' 1949 to 2002]]
Royal Arsenal's first crest, unveiled in 1888, featured three [[cannon]] viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the crest of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich|Borough of Woolwich]]. These can sometimes be mistaken for [[chimney]]s, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a [[cascabel]] on each are clear indicators that they are cannon. In 1922, the club adopted its first single-cannon crest, featuring an eastward-pointing cannon. This crest was only used until 1925 when the cannon was reversed to point westward, its barrel was slimmed down and the club's nickname, ''The Gunners'', was inscribed to the left of it. In 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon, the club's name set in [[blackletter]] above the cannon, and a scroll inscribed with the club's newly adopted [[Latin]] [[motto]], ''Victoria Concordia Crescit'' (meaning &quot;victory comes from harmony&quot;). For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour – red, green, and gold – which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan.

Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to [[copyright]] it; although the club had managed to register the crest as a [[trademark]], and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold 'unofficial' Arsenal merchandise,{{ref|trademark}} Arsenal sought more comprehensive legal protection. Therefore, in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style, which was copyrightable.{{ref|newcrest}} The cannon once again faces east and the club's name is written in a [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]] above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue. The new crest received a mixed response from supporters, with some claiming that it had ignored much of Arsenal's history by removing the blackletter text, motto, and [[Heraldry|coat of arms]].

}}
For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, [[Fred Beardsley]] and [[Morris Bates]], were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was a darker shade of red than the club's modern-day colours, almost purple, and was worn with either white or dark red shorts. 

In 1933 Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter [[pillar box]] red. The team have stuck with the combination since, aside from two seasons. Firstly, in [[1963-64 in English football|1963–64]] the kit reverted to all red, but this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. Secondly, as [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06]] is the last season that Arsenal will play at Highbury, the team's shirts have temporarily reverted back to the original darker red, or &quot;redcurrant&quot;, to reflect the colour worn in the first season at Highbury, in 1913. The club will return to its usual colours at the end of the season.

Arsenal's home colours have been the inspiration for at least two other clubs. In 1909, [[AC Sparta Praha|Sparta Prague]] adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time; in the 1930s, [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip.  Both teams still wear these designs to this day. 

Arsenal's away colours are traditionally yellow and blue, although they wore a green and navy away kit for a short while in the early 1980s. Since the 1990s and the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away colours have been changed every couple of seasons. Generally, they have been either yellow and blue, or two-tone blue designs, although there was a metallic gold and navy strip for the [[2001-02 in English football|2001–02]] season. However, many Arsenal fans feel that the blue shirts bring bad luck – all three of the club's recent Premier League titles have come in a season where the team wore yellow or gold. The [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06]] away colours are yellow and dark grey.

==Stadium==
[[Image:Arsenal Stadium interior North Bank.jpg|thumb|300px|The North Bank stand, [[Arsenal Stadium]].]]
[[Image:Emirates Stadium under construction.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Emirates Stadium]] under construction]]
[[Arsenal Stadium]], widely referred to as Highbury, has been Arsenal's home since the club's move to North London in 1913. The original stadium was built by the renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of [[stadium|terracing]]. In the 1930s, the entire stadium was given a massive overhaul, with new [[Art Deco]] East and West stands constructed, and roofs added to the North Bank and Clock End terraces. At its peak, Highbury could hold over 60,000 spectators, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The [[Taylor Report]] and [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] regulations forced Arsenal to convert Highbury into an all-seater in 1992, reducing its capacity to the current total of 38,500; this capacity has to be reduced further during [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] matches to accommodate additional [[advertising]] hoardings. Expansion has been restricted because the East Stand is now a [[listed building|Grade II listed building]].

These limitations in Highbury's capacity have prevented the club from maximising the revenue that their domestic form could have brought in recent seasons. Although the club remains highly profitable, Arsenal are currently in the process of building [[Emirates Stadium]], a new 60,000-seater stadium at Ashburton Grove, about 500 metres south-west of Highbury. While this project was delayed by red tape (including final approval of the necessary compulsory purchase orders by [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Prescott]]) and rising costs, construction is now nearly complete and the stadium is expected to be ready for the start of the [[2006-07 in English football|2006–07]] season. The stadium is named after its sponsors, the airline company [[Emirates]], with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth approximately £100 million over the term of the deal. As a part of the deal the stadium will be known as Emirates Stadium for at least the first 15 years, and the airline will be the club's shirt sponsor from 2006 until the end of the 2013–14 season.

==Supporters==
Arsenal have a large and generally loyal fanbase, with virtually all home matches selling out. Arsenal fans often refer to themselves as &quot;Gooners&quot;, the name being derived from the team's nickname, &quot;The Gunners&quot;. The club's location, adjoining both wealthy areas such as [[Crouch End]] and [[Hampstead]], mixed areas such as [[Islington]] and [[Highbury]], and working-class suburbs such as [[Holloway, London|Holloway]], [[Finsbury Park]] and [[Stoke Newington]] has meant that Arsenal's supporters have come from across the usual class divides. Arsenal have the highest proportion (7.7%) of non-white attending supporters of any club in English football, probably because of the high proportion of [[minority|ethnic minorities]] in north London.{{ref|minorities}}

Like all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters' clubs, including the Official Arsenal Football Supporters Club, which is affiliated with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association, which maintains an independent line. The club's supporters also publish [[fanzine]]s such as ''The Gooner'', ''Highbury High'', ''Gunflash'' and the less cerebral ''Up The Arse!'' In addition to the usual English [[football chant]]s, Arsenal's supporters sing &quot;One-Nil to the Arsenal&quot; (to the tune of &quot;[[Go West]]&quot;) and &quot;Boring, Boring Arsenal&quot;, which used to be a common taunt from opposition fans but is now sung ironically by Arsenal supporters when the team is playing well.

In recent times, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography, so Arsenal now have many fans not just from London but all over England and indeed the world. While there have always been small pockets of supporters abroad, Arsenal's support base has widened considerably with the advent of [[satellite television]], and there are now significant supporters' clubs in [[Scandinavia]], [[South East Asia|South East]] and [[East Asia]] and the [[United States]]. A 2005 report by Granada Ventures, which owns a 9.9% stake in the club, estimated Arsenal's global fanbase at 27 million, the third largest in the world.{{ref|fanbase}}

Arsenal's longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbour, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], with matches between the two being referred to as [[North London derby|North London derbies]]. Matches against other London sides, such as [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] are also [[derby match|derbies]], but the rivalry is not as intense as that between Arsenal and Tottenham. In addition, Arsenal and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] have had a strong on-pitch rivalry since the late 1980s, which has intensified in recent years when both clubs have been competing for the Premier League title.

==Ownership==
Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings, operates as a [[public limited company]]. However, Arsenal's ownership is considerably different from that of other football clubs. Only 62,000 shares in Arsenal have been issued, and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the [[FTSE]] or [[AIM]]; instead, they are traded infrequently on [[OFEX]], a specialist market. As of December 2005, Arsenal's [[market capitalization]] value is £290m, and the club made a [[corporation tax|pre-tax]] [[profit]] of £19.3m in the 2004-05 [[financial year]].{{ref|ofex}}

Currently, the club's largest shareholders are Danny Fiszman (a London [[diamond]] dealer) and Nina Bracewell-Smith (a descendant by marriage of former chairman [[Bracewell Smith|Sir Bracewell Smith]]), who hold 25.2% and 15.9% respectively. Vice-chairman [[David Dein]] holds 14.6% while club [[chairman]] [[Peter Hill-Wood]] owns less than 1%.{{ref|afc-accounts}} Arsenal's board of directors hold the majority of the club's shares, but in recent years, with Arsenal becoming a significant media asset, outside organisations have bought into the club. These include entertainment firm Granada Ventures (a subsidiary of [[ITV plc]]) (9.9%) and [[hedge fund]] [[Lansdowne Partners]] (2.7%); Lansdowne used to have a stake in [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] before selling it to [[Malcolm Glazer]].{{ref|lansdowne}}

==Arsenal in popular culture==
As one of the most successful teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in [[British culture]]. The club were the backdrop to one of the earliest football-related [[film]]s, ''[[The Arsenal Stadium Mystery]]'' (1939). The film is centred on a [[friendly match]] between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned whilst playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves, although only manager George Allison was given a speaking part.

More recently, the book ''[[Fever Pitch]]'' by [[Nick Hornby]] was an [[autobiography|autobiographical]] account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of, and may have played an active part in, the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s. The book was later made into a film starring [[Colin Firth]], which centred on the club's [[1988-89 in English football|1988–89]] title win.

Arsenal's perceived tendency to be defensive and &quot;boring&quot; through the 1970s and 1980s made the team the butt of jokes by many comedians such as [[Eric Morecambe]]. The theme was repeated in the 1997 film ''[[The Full Monty]]'', in a scene where the lead actors move in a line and raise their hands, deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defence's [[Offside law (football)|offside]] trap, in an attempt to co-ordinate their [[stripping]].

The club is also mentioned in several ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' sketches, and in [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'': a barman remarks that the impending [[end of the world]] is a &quot;lucky escape&quot; for Arsenal, who are playing that afternoon. Most recently, in the 2004 box office hit ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]'' the stars put on Arsenal tracksuits to escape from a hotel as part of one of their European heists.

==Arsenal Ladies==
{{details|Arsenal L.F.C.}}
[[Arsenal L.F.C.|Arsenal Ladies]] are the [[Women's football (soccer)|women's football]] club affiliated to Arsenal. Founded in 1987, they turned semi-professional in 2002 and are one of the most successful teams, if not the dominant team, in [[Women's football in England|English women's football]] today. They are managed by [[Vic Akers]], who is also kit manager for the men's side, and play in the [[FA Women's Premier League National Division|FA Women's Premier League]]. They are currently reigning League champions, having won their seventh title in 2005.

As well as their seven League titles, Arsenal Ladies have won the [[FA Women's Cup]] six times and the [[Women's League Cup]] eight times; this includes two Trebles in 1993 and 2001. They have also reached the semifinals of the [[UEFA Women's Cup]] twice, the furthest any English women's club have ever got. While the men's and women's clubs are formally separate they have quite close ties; Arsenal vice-chairman [[David Dein]] is president of Arsenal Ladies, and the ladies are entitled to play once a season at Highbury (they usually play their home matches at [[Boreham Wood F.C.|Boreham Wood]]).

==Statistics and records==
{{details|Arsenal F.C. records}}
[[David O'Leary]] holds the record for Arsenal appearances, having played 722 first-team matches between 1975 and 1993. Fellow [[centre half]] and former captain [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] comes second, having played 668 times. The record for a [[goalkeeper]] is held by [[David Seaman]], with 563 appearances.

Current Arsenal captain [[Thierry Henry]] is the club's top goalscorer with 201 goals in all competitions (as of [[February 22]], [[2006]]), having surpassed [[Ian Wright]]'s total of 185 in October 2005. Wright's record had stood since 1997, a feat which overtook the longstanding total of 178 goals set by winger [[Cliff Bastin]] in 1939. Henry also holds the club record for goals scored in the League (152), a record that had been held by Bastin until February 2006.

Arsenal's record home attendance is 73,707, for a [[UEFA Champions League]] match against [[RC Lens]] on [[November 25]], [[1998]] at [[Wembley Stadium]], where Arsenal formerly played home European matches because of the limits on Highbury's capacity. The record attendance for an Arsenal match at Highbury is 73,295, for a 0-0 draw against [[Sunderland A.F.C|Sunderland]] on [[9 March]] [[1935]]. The current capacity of Highbury is 38,500, and the planned capacity of Emirates Stadium is 60,000, so these records are unlikely to be broken in the near future.

Arsenal have also set records in English football, most notably the most consecutive seasons spent in the top flight (79, as of 2005) and the longest run of unbeaten League matches (49 between May 2003 and October 2004). This included all 38 matches of the [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04]] season, making Arsenal only the second club ever to finish a top-flight campaign unbeaten, after [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] (who played only 22 matches) in [[1888-89 in English football|1888–89]].

#{{note|henrynorris}} It has been alleged that Arsenal's promotion, on historical grounds rather than merit, was thanks to underhand actions by the then Arsenal chairman, [[Henry Norris|Sir Henry Norris]] (see [[History of Arsenal F.C.]] for more details). No firm proof has ever been offered, though Chapter Two of ''Rebels for the Cause'' (listed below) and [http://www.emiratesstadium.info/serv01.htm this webpage] present plenty of supporting evidence. An investigation by ''[[Four Four Two]]'' magazine reported that financial irregularities had taken place.

'''Ahmed Shah Masood''' ('''&amp;#1575;&amp;#1581;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1583; &amp;#1588;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1607; &amp;#1605;&amp;#1587;&amp;#1593;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1583;''') (c. 1953 - [[September 9]], [[2001]]) (''variant [[transliteration]]s include Ahmad, Massoud, etc.'') was a [[Kabul University]] engineering student turned [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] military leader who played a leading role in driving the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] army out of [[Afghanistan]], earning him the nickname ''Lion of [[Panjshir]]''. 

Massoud was an ethnic [[Tajiks|Tajik]] who was charismatic and respected by the Afghan population.
In the early [[1990s]] he became Defence Minister under President [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]].  Following the collapse of Rabbani's government and the rise of the [[Taliban]] regime, Massoud became the military leader of the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]], a coalition of various armed Afghani opposition groups, in a prolonged civil war.  As the Taliban established control over most of Afghanistan, Massoud's forces were increasingly forced into the mountainous areas of the north, where they controlled some 10% of Afghanistan's territory and perhaps 30% of its population until late 2001.

Massoud was the victim of a suicide attack which occurred at Khvajeh Ba Odin on [[September 9]], [[2001]], two days before the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]] in the [[United States]], a timing considered significant by some commentators who believe [[Osama bin Laden]] ordered the assassination to ensure he would have the Taliban's protection and cooperation in Afghanistan. The attackers were two [[Arab]]s who claimed to be [[Belgium|Belgian]]s originally from [[Morocco]].  However their passports turned out to be stolen.  According to some accounts they were posing as journalists, perhaps intending to attack several Northern Alliance council members simultaneously.

They set off a bomb in either a video camera or a belt worn by one of the attackers.  It appears that Massoud died within 30 minutes, although his death was denied until an official announcement that was made on [[September 13]].  The explosion also killed Mohammed Asim Suhail, a Northern Alliance official, while [[Mohammad Fahim Dashty]] and Massoud Khalili were injured.  One of the attackers was killed by the explosion and the other was shot while trying to escape. 

The French secret service revealed [[October 16]], [[2003]] that the camera used by Massoud's assassins had been stolen in [[December]] [[2000]] in [[Grenoble]], [[France]] from a [[photojournalist]], [[Jean-Pierre Vincendet]], who was then working on a story on that city's Christmas store window displays. By tracing the serial number that appeared in the camera, the [[FBI]] was able to determine Vincendet as the original owner. The French secret service and the FBI then began working on tracing the route that the camera took between the time it was taken from Vincendet and the Massoud assassination.

Massoud is the subject of [[Ken Follett]]'s ''Lie Down With Lions,'' a novel about the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].

[[Image:Athanasius Kircher's.gif|thumb|right|250px|[[Athanasius Kircher|Athanasius Kircher's]] map of a possible Atlantis' location. From ''Mundus Subterraneus'' [[1669]].]]
The &quot;[[Lost city]]&quot; of '''Atlantis''' was an ancient [[mythical place|mythical]] island, whose existence and location have never been confirmed. The first references to Atlantis are from the [[classical Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]], who said it was engulfed by the ocean as the result of an earthquake 9,000 years before his own time. Plato claimed it was somewhere outside the [[Pillars of Hercules]], now known as the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. While there are many theories about Atlantis, nearly all serious research shows that Atlantis never existed as Plato described it, although elements of his story may have been drawn from real events.

==Origin==
===Plato===
[[Image:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|right|Plato as depicted by the painter [[Raphael]].]]

Plato's accounts of Atlantis are in his works ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Critias (Plato)|Critias]]''; these are the earliest known references to the mythological civilization of the Atlanteans(360 BC). The Timaeus dialogue is an introduction, followed by a concise history of the universe and ancient civilizations, according to Plato's particular philosophy.  In the introductory portion, [[Socrates]] muses on the perfect society (as described in Plato's Republic) and wonders if he and his guests could come up with a story which puts this society into action.  Critias mentions an allegedly historical tale that he would make the perfect example, and follows up by describing Atlantis in the Critias dialogue, mainly its origins and form.  (Ancient Athens represented the &quot;perfect society,&quot; and Atlantis the opponent, representing the opposite of the &quot;perfect&quot; traits described in the Republic.)  Critias' account is purported to have originated from a visit to Egypt by the Athenian lawgiver [[Solon]], where [[Sonchis]], priest of [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]], translated it into [[Greek language|Greek]] for him.

According to Critias, the [[Hellenic]] gods of old divided the land so that each god might own a lot; Poseidon was appropriately, and to his liking, bequeathed the island of Atlantis. The island was larger than [[Libya]] and [[Asia Minor]] combined, but has since been sunk by an earthquake and became an impassable mud shoal, inhibiting travel between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The Egyptians described Atlantis as an island approximately 700 km across, comprising mostly mountains in the northern portions and along the shore, and encompassing a great plain of an oblong shape in the south &quot;extending in one direction three thousand [[Ancient Greek weights and measures|stadia]] [about 600 km], but across the centre inland it was two thousand stadia [about 400 km]&quot;.

Fifty [[Ancient Greek weights and measures|stadia]] inland from the middle of the southern coast was a &quot;mountain not very high on any side&quot;.  Here lived a native woman with whom Poseidon fell in love and bore five pairs of male twins.  The eldest of these, [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean (now the [[Atlantic Ocean]]), and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his [[fiefdom]].  Atlas's twin [[Gadeirus]] or [[Eumelus]] in Greek, was given the easternmost portion of the island which also lay at its northern extreme facing [[Gades]], a town in southern Spain.  The other four pairs of twins—Ampheres and Evaemon, Mneseus and Autochthon, Elasippus and Mestor, and Azaes (the [[Azores]]?) and Diaprepes—&quot;were the inhabitants and rulers of divers islands in the open sea&quot;.

Poseidon carved the inland mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular [[moat|moats]] of increasing width, varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size.  The Atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain, making a route to the rest of the island.  They dug a great canal to the sea, and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain; they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats.  Every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers, and a wall surrounded each of the city's rings.  The walls were constructed of red, white and black rock quarried from the moats, and were covered with [[brass]], [[tin]] and [[orichalcum]], respectively.

According to Critias, 9,000 years before his lifetime, a war took place between those outside the ''Pillars of Heracles'' and those who dwelt within them.  The Atlanteans had conquered the Mediterranean as far east as [[Egypt]] and the continent into [[Tyrrhenia]], and subjected its people to slavery.  The Athenians led an alliance of resistors against the Atlantean empire and as the alliance disintegrated, prevailed alone against the empire, liberating the occupied lands. “But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea.&quot;

===Aristotle===
[[Image:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] copy of a bust of Aristotle by [[Lysippos]] in the [[Louvre Museum]].]]
[[Aristotle]] wrote of a large island in the Atlantic Ocean that the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] knew as [[Antilia]]. [[Proclus]], the commentator of ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''  mentions that [[Marcellus]], relying on ancient historians, stated in his ''[[Aethiopiaka]]'' that in the Outer Ocean (which meant all oceans, not just the Atlantic) there were seven small islands dedicated to [[Persephone]], and three large ones; one of these, comprising 1,000 ''stadia'' in length, was dedicated to [[Poseidon]].  Proclus tells us that [[Crantor]] reported that he, too, had seen the columns on which the story of Atlantis was preserved as reported by Plato: the [[Sais, Egypt|Saite]] priest showed him its history in [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic]] characters.  Some other writers called it ''Poseidonis'' after Poseidon. [[Plutarch]] mentions ''Saturnia'' or ''Ogygia'' about five days' sail to the west of what is called nowadays [[Britain]]. He added that westwards from that island, there were the three islands of [[Cronus]], to where proud and warlike men used to come from the continent beyond the islands, in order to offer sacrifice to the gods of the ocean.

===Other Greek accounts===
The historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] wrote that the [[intelligentsia]] of [[Alexandria]] considered the destruction of Atlantis a historical fact and described a class of [[earthquake]]s that suddenly, by a violent motion, opened up huge mouths and so swallowed up portions of the earth, as once in the Atlantic Ocean a large island was swallowed up. [[Diodorus Siculus]] recorded that the Atlanteans did not know the fruits of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] called this island &quot;Satyrides,&quot; referring to the Atlantes and those who profess to know the measurements of the earth.  He states that far west of the Ocean there lies a group of islands whose inhabitants are red-skinned and whose hair is like that of the horse. ([[Christopher Columbus]] described the Native Americans similarly.)

A fragmentary work of [[Theophrastus]] of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]] tells about the colonies of Atlantis in the sea. [[Hesiod]] wrote that the garden of the [[Hesperides]] was on an island in the sea where the [[sun]] sets. [[Pliny the Elder]] recorded that this land was 12,000 km distant (by modern measurment) from [[Cádiz]], and Uba, a [[Numidian]] talks of an enormous island outside the [[Pillars of Hercules]]. He describes it as having a climate that is very mild; fruits and vegetables grow ripe throughout the year. There are huge mountains covered with large forests, and wide, irrigable plains with navigable rivers. [[Scylax of Caryanda]] gives similar account.

Marcellus claims that the survivors of the sinking Atlantis migrated to [[Western Europe]]. [[Timagenes]] tells almost the same, citing the [[Druids]] of [[Gaul]] as his sources. He tries to classify the [[Gallic]] tribes according to their origins and tells of one of these claiming that they were colonists who came there from a remote island. [[Theopompus]] of [[Chios]], a Greek [[historian]] called this land beyond the ocean as &quot;Meropis&quot;.  The dialogue between King [[Midas]] and the wise Silenus mentions the Meropids, the first men with huge cities of gold and silver. Silenus knows that besides the well-known portions of the world there is another, unknown, of incredible immensity, where immeasurably vast blooming meadows and pastures feed herds of various, huge and mighty beasts. [[Claudius Aelianus]] cites [[Theopompus]], knowing of the existence of the huge island out in the Atlantic as a continuing tradition among the Phoenicians or Carthaginians of Cádiz. Perhaps the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] friar [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] understood Plato better than the ancient and modern &quot;Aristotelians&quot;, says Merezhkovsky. In his ''[[Topographia Christiana]]'' he included a chart of the (flat) world: it showed an inner continent, a compact mainland surrounded by sea, and this was surrounded by an outer ring-shaped continent, with the inscription, &quot;The earth beyond the Ocean, where men lived before the [[Flood]].&quot;

==Modern interest==
[[Image:Atlantis map 1882.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A map showing a supposed location of Atlantis. From Ignatius Donnelly's ''Atlantis:The Antediluvian World'', [[1882]].]]
With rare exceptions, such as [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]]'s book ''[[The New Atlantis]]'', interest in Atlantis mostly languished, until, some 2,200 years after Plato, the [[1882]] publication of ''[[Atlantis: the Antediluvian World]]'' by [[Ignatius Donnelly]]. Donnelly took Plato's account of Atlantis seriously and attempted to establish that all known [[ancient civilization]]s were descended from its high-[[neolithic]] culture.   

In middle and late [[19th century]], several serious [[Mesoamerica]]n scholars, starting with [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]], and including [[Edward Herbert Thompson]] and [[Augustus Le Plongeon]] proposed that Atlantis was somehow related to [[Maya]]n and [[Aztec]] culture. However, several of the researchers later rejected those claims.  

[[Image:Cayce 1910.jpg|thumb|right|American psychic [[Edgar Cayce]], 1910]]
Around this same time, the mythical nature of Atlantis was combined with other [[Lost Lands|lost continent]] myths such as [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] by popular figures in the [[occult]] and the growing [[new age]] phenomenon.  [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|Helena Blavatsky]], the &quot;Grandmother of the New Age movement&quot; writes in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' that the Atlanteans were cultural heroes (contrary to Plato who describes them mainly as a military threat), and are the fourth &quot;[[Root Race]]&quot;, succeeded by the &quot;[[Aryan race]]&quot;. [[Rudolf Steiner]] based much of his writings on occult revelations of Mu or Atlantis. Famed psychic [[Edgar Cayce]] gave its geographical location as the [[Caribbean]], and proposed that [[Edgar Cayce#Major themes|Atlantis]] was an ancient, now-submerged, highly-evolved civilization which had ships and aircraft powered by a mysterious form of energy crystal. 

===Nationalist and Socialist ideas of Atlantis===
The concept of Atlantis also entered [[Nazi Mysticism|National Socialist Mysticism]] through [[Theosophy]] and [[Anthroposophy]]. In [[1938]], [[Heinrich Himmler]] organized a search in [[Tibet]] to find a remnant of the white Atlanteans. According to [[Julius Evola]] (''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]'', 1934), the Atlanteans were [[Hyperboreans]] -- Nordic [[Übermensch|supermen]] who originated on the [[North pole]]. Similarly, [[Alfred Rosenberg]] (''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'', 1930) spoke of a &quot;nordic-atlantean&quot; or &quot;aryan-nordic&quot; [[master race]]. [[Aleister Crowley]] has also written an esoteric history of Atlantis, although this may be intended more as [[metaphor]] than as fact.

===Recent times===
As [[continental drift]] became better understood and accepted during the 1950s, most &quot;Lost Continent&quot; theories of Atlantis were shown as false. In response, some recent theories propose that elements of Plato's story were derived from earlier myths.

[[Image:Santorini Landsat.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite image of the islands of [[Santorini]]. This location is often rumored to have been the location of Atlantis.]]

Since Donnelly's day, there have been dozens&amp;mdash;perhaps hundreds&amp;mdash;of locations proposed for Atlantis. Some are more or less serious attempts at legitimate scholarly or archaeological works; others have been made by [[psychic]] or other [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] means. Many of the proposed sites share some of the characteristics of the Atlantis story (water, catastrophic end, relevant time period), but none have been proven conclusively to be the historical Atlantis.  Most of the historical proposed locations are in or nearby the Mediterranean, either islands such as [[Sardinia]], [[Crete]] and [[Santorini]], [[Cyprus]], [[Malta]], and [[Ponza]] or as land based cities or states such as [[Troy]], [[Andalucia]] or Tantalus (in province of [[Manisa]]), [[Turkey]], and the new theory of [[Israel]]-[[Sinai]] or [[Canaan]] as possible locations. The island of [[Santorini]], according to geologists, experienced a massive volcanic eruption about 1640 BC.  The eruption caused a massive [[tsunami]] that devastated the [[Minoan civilization]] on the nearby island of Crete, further leading some to believe that may have been the catastrophe that inspired the story. 

===Outside the Mediterranean=== 
Locations as far as [[Antarctica]], [[Indonesia]] and the [[Caribbean]] have been proposed as Atlantis' site.  The submerged island of [[Spartel]] near the Strait of Gibraltar is a proposed location which would coincide with some elements of Plato's account; location (just outside the [[Pillars of Hercules]]) and date of submersion (9000 years before Plato). In the area of the [[Black Sea]] there are three possible locations: [[Bosporus]], [[Sinop]] and [[Ancomah]], a legendary place near [[Trabzon]]. The nearby [[Sea of Azov]] was proposed as another site in 2003. Various islands or island groups in the Atlantic were also identified as possible locations, notably the [[Azores]] (Mid-Atlantic islands which are a territory of Portugal), and several [[Caribbean]] islands. In Northern Europe, [[Finland]] (by Finnish pseudohistorian [[Ior Bock]]), [[Sweden]] (by [[Olof Rudbeck]] in &quot;Atland&quot;, 1672-1702), and the North Sea have been proposed. Areas in the Pacific and Indian Ocean have also been proposed including [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and stories of a lost continent off [[India]] named &quot;[[Kumari Kandam]]&quot; have drawn parallels to Atlantis. Even Cuba has been suggested. The [[Canary Islands]] have also been identified as a possible location, west of the Straits of Gibraltar but in close proximity to the Mediterranean Sea. Some believe that Atlantis stretched from the tip of Spain to Central America. Finally it has been argued that the story is a mixup, with [[Ireland]] as the last place that has contributed geographical details to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For music albums named ''Autobiography'', see [[Autobiography (album)]]''

An '''autobiography''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''auton'', 'self', ''bios'', 'life' and ''graphein'', 'write') is a [[biography]] written by the subject  or composed conjointly with a collaborative writer (styled &quot;as told to&quot; or &quot;with&quot;). The term dates from the late eighteenth century, but the form is much older.

Biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints; an autobiography may be based entirely on the writer's memory. A name for such a work in Antiquity was an ''[[apologia]],'' essentially more self-justification than introspection. [[John Henry Newman]]'s autobiography is his ''Apologia pro vita sua.'' [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] applied the title ''[[Confessions (book)|Confessions]]'' to his autobiographical work (and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] took up the same title). Probably the most famous German autobiography is still [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s  ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit]]''.

''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]]'', the first secular biography published in the United States, served as a model for subsequent American autobiographies. [[African Americans|African American]] autobiography has developed from [[slave narrative]]s. [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[W.E.B. DuBois]] have both published several autobiographies.

A [[memoir]] is slightly different from an autobiography.  Traditionally, a memoir focuses on the &quot;life and times&quot; of the character, while an autobiography has a narrower, more intimate focus on his or her own memories, feelings and emotions. Memoirs have often been written by politicians or military leaders as a way to record and publish an account of their public exploits. In the eighteenth century, &quot;scandalous memoirs&quot; were written (mostly anonymously) by prostitutes or libertines: these were widely read in France for their juicy gossip. But memoir has another meaning too. The pagan rhetor [[Libanius]] framed his life memoir as one of his [[oration]]s, not the public kind, but the literary kind that would be read aloud in the privacy of one's study. This kind of memoir refers to the idea in ancient Greece and Rome, that memoirs were like &quot;memos,&quot; pieces of unfinished and unpublished writing which a writer might use as a memory aid to make a more finished document later on. In more recent times, memoirs are also life stories which can be about the writer and about another person at the some time.

Modern memoirs are often based on old [[diary|diaries]], [[letter]]s, and [[photograph]]s. The term &quot;memoir&quot; has begun to replace &quot;autobiography&quot; in its popular use. 

Until the last 20 years or so, few people without some degree of fame tried to write and publish a memoir.  But with the critical and commercial success in the United States of such memoirs ''[[Angela's Ashes]]'' and ''[[The Color of Water]]'' more and more people have been encouraged to try their hand at this genre.

[[Paul Delaney]] has coined the term &quot;ad hoc autobiography&quot; to describe an autobiography motivated by the desire to exploit some temporary notoriety. Such autobiographies, often written by a [[ghostwriter]], are routinely published on the lives of professional athletes and media celebrities&amp;mdash;and to a lesser extent about politicians. Some celebrities admit to not having read their &quot;autobiographies.&quot; 

[[Mark Twain]] was probably the first popular person to include photography in his autobiography. He was specially interested and involved on the taking of the pictures to control his photographic persona.

[[Image:Solidus-Arcadius-RIC 1205.jpg|thumb|300px|Arcadius, holding a [[labarum]], defeating an enemy.]]
'''Flavius Arcadius''' ([[377]]/[[378]]&amp;ndash;[[May 1]], [[408]]) was [[Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] in the Eastern half of the [[Roman Empire]] from [[395]] until his death.

Arcadius was the elder son of [[Theodosius I]] and [[Aelia Flaccilla]], and brother of [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]], who would become a [[Western Roman Emperor]]. His father declared him an [[Augustus]] in January, [[383]]. His younger brother was also declared an Augustus in [[393]].

As Emperors, Honorius was under the control of the Romanized Vandal ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Stilicho|Flavius Stilicho]] while Arcadius was dominated by one of his ministers, [[Rufinus (Byzantine official)|Rufinus]].  Stilicho is alleged by some to have wanted control of both emperors, and is supposed to have had Rufinus assassinated by Gothic mercenaries in 395, but definite proof of these allegations is lacking.  In any case, Arcadius' new advisor [[Eutropius (Byzantine official)|Eutropius]] simply took Rufinus' place as the power behind the Eastern imperial throne.  Arcadius was also dominated by his wife [[Aelia Eudoxia]], who convinced her husband to dismiss Eutropius in [[399]].  Eudoxia was strongly opposed by [[John Chrysostom]], the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]], who felt that she had used her family's wealth to gain control over the emperor.  Eudoxia used her influence to have Chrysostom deposed in [[404]], but she died later that year.  

Arcadius was dominated for the rest of his rule by [[Anthemius (Byzantine Prefect)|Anthemius]], the [[Praetorian prefect|Praetorian Prefect]], who made peace with Stilicho in the West.  Arcadius himself was more concerned with appearing to be a pious [[Christianity|Christian]] than he was with political or military matters, and he died, only nominally in control of his empire, in 408.

The '''Arabs''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: عرب ʻarab) are a large and [[heterogeneous]] [[ethnic group]] found throughout the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], originating in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] of [[southwest Asia]].  

==Who is an Arab?==
The definition of who an Arab is has several aspects:
* [[Identity (social science)|Ethnic identity]]: someone who considers himself to be an Arab (regardless of [[racial]] or [[ethnic origin]]) and is recognized as such by others. 
* [[Language|Linguistic]]: someone whose [[first language]] is [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (including any of its [[Varieties of Arabic|varieties]]); this definition covers more than 700 million people. Arabic belongs to the [[Semitic]] family of languages.
* [[Genealogy|Genealogical]]: someone who can trace his or her ancestry back to the original inhabitants of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].
* [[Political geography|Political]]: someone who is a resident or [[citizen]] of a country where Arabic is an [[official language|official]] or [[national language]], or is a member of the [[Arab League]] or is part of the wider [[Arab world]]; this definition would cover more than 300 million people, but it is rather simplistic and rigid in that it excludes the entire [[Diaspora]] but includes [[indigenous]] or [[migrant]] [[ethnic minority|minorities]] 

The relative importance of these factors is estimated differently by different groups.  Most people who consider themselves Arabs do so on the basis of the overlap of the political and linguistic definitions. However, some members of groups which fulfill both criteria reject the identity on the basis of the genealogical definition; [[Lebanese]] [[Maronites]], for example, may reject the Arab label in favor of a narrower [[Phoenicia|Phoenician]]-Lebanese national identity, as do many Coptic and Muslim Egyptians who embrace the continuation of their ancient heritage. Groups using a non-Arabic liturgical language - such as [[Copts]] in [[Egypt]] - are especially likely to consider themselves non-Arab, even though they are not ethnically distinct from their Muslim compatriots. Not many people consider themselves Arab on the basis of the political definition without the linguistic one&amp;mdash;thus, [[Kurd]]s or [[Berber]]s do not usually identify themselves as Arab&amp;mdash;but some do (for instance, some Berbers do consider themselves Arabs, and Kurds were in some historical circumstances seen as Arabs or Turks or Persians). In addition, a majority of the population of [[Qatar]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] is made up of non-citizen non-Arab [[immigrant]]s and so the political definition does not apply there either.

A ''[[hadith]]'' of questionable authenticity[http://www.islamtoday.com/show_detail_section.cfm?q_id=266&amp;main_cat_id=11], related by [[Ibn Asakir]] in ''Târîkh Dimashq'' and attributed by its narrator Salmân b. `Abd Allah to Islam's prophet [[Muhammad]], expresses a common sentiment in declaring that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Being an Arab is not because of your father or mother, but being an Arab is on account of your tongue. Whoever speaks Arabic is an Arab.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Habib Hassan Touma (1996, p.xviii), &quot;An 'Arab', in the modern sense of the word, is one who is a national of an Arab state, has command of the Arabic language, and possesses a fundamental knowledge of Arabian tradition, that is, of the manners, customs, and political and social systems of the culture.&quot;

On its formation in 1946, the [[Arab League]] defined an &quot;Arab&quot; as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;An Arab is a person whose language is Arabic, who lives in an Arabic speaking country, who is in sympathy with the aspirations of the Arabic speaking peoples.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The genealogical definition was widely used in [[medieval]] times ([[Ibn Khaldun]], for instance, does not use the word ''Arab'' to refer to &quot;Arabized&quot; peoples, but only to those of originally Arabian descent), but is usually no longer considered to be particularly significant.

==Religions==
Before the coming of [[Islam]], most Arabs followed a religion featuring the worship of a number of deities, including [[Hubal]], [[Wadd]], [[Al-Lat]], [[Manat]], and [[Uzza]], while some tribes had converted to Christianity or Judaism, and a few individuals, the ''[[hanif]]s'', had apparently rejected [[polytheism]] in favor of a vague [[monotheism]].  The most prominent Arab Christian kingdoms were the [[Ghassanid]] and [[Lakhmid]] kingdoms.  With the expansion of Islam, the majority of Arabs were rapidly conquered and became Muslims, and the pre-Islamic polytheistic traditions disappeared.

At present, most Arabs are [[Muslim]]s.  [[Sunni Islam]] dominates in most areas, overwhelmingly so in North Africa; [[Shia Islam]] is prevalent in [[Bahrain]], [[Iran]], southern [[Iraq]] and adjacent parts of [[Saudi Arabia]], southern [[Lebanon]], parts of [[Syria]], and northern [[Yemen]].  The tiny [[Druze]] community, belonging to a secretive offshoot of Islam, is usually considered Arab, but sometimes considered an ethnicity in its own right.

Reliable estimates of the number of Arab [[Christian]]s, which in any case depends on the definition of &quot;Arab&quot; used, vary.  According to [http://arabworld.nitle.org/texts.php?module_id=6&amp;reading_id=63&amp;sequence=4 Fargues 1998], &quot;Today Christians only make up 9.2 % of the population of the Near East&quot;. In Lebanon they now number only about 40 % of the population, in Syria they make up about 10 to 15 %, in the Palestinian territories the figure is 3.8 %, and in Israel Arab Christians constitute 2.1 %. In Egypt, they constitute 5.9 % of the population, and in Iraq they presumably comprise 2.9 % of the populace. Most [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]n Arabs (about two-thirds) are [[Arab Christians]], particularly from [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Lebanon]].

[[Jew]]s from Arab countries - mainly [[Mizrahi Jews]] and [[Yemenite Jews]] - are today usually not categorised as Arab.  Sociologist Philip Mendes asserts that before the anti-Jewish actions of the 1930s and 1940s, overall [[Iraqi Jews]] &quot;viewed themselves as Arabs of the Jewish faith, rather than as a separate race or nationality&quot;. [http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~ajds/mendes_refugees.htm] Prior to the emergence of the term ''Mizrahi'', the term &quot;Arab Jews&quot; (''Yehudim ‘Áravim'', &amp;#1497;&amp;#1492;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1491;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1501; &amp;#1506;&amp;#1512;&amp;#1489;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1501;) was used to describe Jews of the [[Arab world]]. The term is rarely used today. The few remaining Jews in the Arab countries reside mostly in Morocco and Tunisia. Between the late 1940s and early 1960s, following the creation of the state of [[Israel]], most of these Jews left their countries of birth and are now mostly concentrated in Israel, but many also live in [[France]], and however more Jews reside within the [[United States]]. (see [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]]).

==History==
The first written attestation of the ethnonym &quot;Arab&quot; occurs in an [[Assyria]]n inscription of [[853 BC]], where [[Shalmaneser III]] lists a King [[Gindibu]] of ''mâtu arbâi'' (Arab land) as among the people he defeated at the [[Battle of Karkar]].  Some of the names given in these texts are Aramaic, while others are the first attestations of Proto-Arabic dialects.  The [[Hebrew Bible]] likewise refers occasionally to peoples called ''`Arvi'' (or variants thereof), translated as &quot;Arab&quot; or &quot;Arabian&quot;.  The scope of the Hebrew term at this early stage is unclear, but it seems to have referred to various desert-dwelling [[Semitic]] tribes in the [[Syrian Desert]] and [[Arabia]].  Its earliest attested use referring to the southern &quot;[[Qahtanite]]&quot; Arabs is much later.

Proto-Arabic, or Ancient North Arabian, texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence into history.  The earliest such texts are written not in the modern Arabic alphabet, nor in its Nabataean ancestor, but in variants of the Epigraphic South Arabian ''[[musnad]]'', beginning in the 8th century BC with the [[Hasaean]] inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia, and continuing from the 6th century BC on with the [[Lihyanite]] texts (in southeastern Saudi Arabia) and the [[Thamudic]] texts (found throughout Arabia and the Sinai, and not in reality connected with [[Thamud]]). Later come the [[Safaitic]] inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BC) and the many Arabic personal names attested in [[Nabataean]] inscriptions (which are, however, written in Aramaic.)  From about the 2nd century BC, a few inscriptions from [[Qaryat al-Faw]] (near [[Sulayyil]]) reveal a dialect which is no longer considered &quot;Proto-Arabic&quot;, but Pre-Classical Arabic.

By the fourth century AD, the Arab kingdoms of the [[Lakhmids]] in southern [[Iraq]] and [[Ghassanids]] in southern [[Syria]] had emerged just south of the [[Fertile Crescent]] and ended up allying respectively with the [[Sassanid]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Empires. Thus they were constantly at war with each other on behalf of their imperial patrons.  However, their courts were responsible for some notable examples of pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, and for some of the few surviving [[pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions]] in the Arabic alphabet.  The Lakhmid kingdom was dissolved by the Sassanids in 602, while the Ghassanids would hold out until engulfed by the expansion of [[Islam]].

In the [[Qur'an]], the word ''{{ArabDIN|ʿarab}}'' does not appear, only the [[nisba]] adjective, ''{{ArabDIN|ʿarabiyyun}}'': The Qur'an is referring to itself as ''{{ArabDIN|ʿarabiyyun}}'' &quot;Arabic&quot; and ''{{ArabDIN|mubinun}}'' &quot;clear&quot;. The two qualities are connected, for example in ayat [[Az-Zukhruf|43]].2-3, &quot;By the ''clear'' Book: We have made it an ''Arabic'' recitation in order that you may understand&quot;, and the Qur'an came to be regarded as the prime example of the ''{{ArabDIN|al-ʿarabiyyatu}}'', the language of the Arabs. The term ''[[I`rab|{{ArabDIN|ʾiʿrāb}}]]'' is from the same root, referring to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. The plural noun ''{{ArabDIN|ʾaʿrāb}}'' refers to the [[Bedouin]] tribes of the desert who resisted Muhammad, for example in ayat [[At-Tawba|9]].97,
:''{{ArabDIN|ʾaʿrābu ʾašaddu kufrān wanifāqān}}'' &quot;the Bedouin are the worst in [[kafir|disbelief]] and hypocrisy&quot;. 
Based on this, in early Islamic terminology, ''{{ArabDIN|ʿarab}}'' referred to sedentary Arabs, living in cities such as Mecca and Medina, and ''{{ArabDIN|ʾaʿrāb}}'' referred to the Arab Bedouins, carrying a negative connotation due to the Qur'anic verdict just cited. Following the [[Islamic conquest]] of the [[8th century]], however, the language of the nomadic Arabs came to be regarded as preserving the highest purity by the grammarians following [[Abi Ishaq]], and the term  {{ArabDIN|kalam al-ʿArab}} &quot;language of the Arabs&quot; came to denote the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins.

The relation of ''{{ArabDIN|ʿarab}}''  and ''{{ArabDIN|ʾaʿrāb}}'' is complicated further by the notion of &quot;lost Arabs&quot;   ''{{ArabDIN|al-ʿArab al-ba'ida}}'' mentioned in the Qur'an as punished for their disbelief. All contemporary Arabs were considered as descended from two ancestors,  [[Qahtan]] and [[Adnan]], of which Qahtan was related to the &quot;lost Arabs&quot;, and the [[Southern Arabs]] were identified as of his lineage, regarded as the &quot;real Arabs&quot;, ''{{ArabDIN|al-ʿArab al-ʿariba}}'', while the Northern Arabs, including the tribes of Mecca, were considered the descendents of Adnan, in Islamic tradition traced back to [[Ismail]] son of [[Abraham]], said to have been arabized at a later period.

Versteegh (1997) is uncertain whether to ascribe this distinction to the memory of a real difference of origin of  the two groups, but it is certain that the difference was strongly felt in early Islamic times, even in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]], there was enmity between the  Qays of the Northern and the Kalb of the Southern group. The so-called [[Himyaritic language]] described by [[Al-Hamdani]]  (died [[946]]) appears to be a special case of language contact between the two groups, an originally  North Arabic dialect spoken in the South, and influenced by [[Old South Arabian]].

During the [[8th century|8th]] and [[9th century|9th]] centuries, the Arabs (specifically the [[Umayyad]]s, and later [[Abbasids]]) forged an empire whose borders touched southern [[France]] in the west, [[China]] in the east, [[Asia Minor]] in the north, and the [[Sudan]] in the south. This was one of the largest land empires in history. Throughout much of this area, the Arabs spread the religion of [[Islam]] and the Arabic language (the language of the [[Qur'an]]) through [[conversion]] and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Many groups came to be known as &quot;Arabs&quot; not through descent but through this process of [[Arabization]]. Thus, over time, the term ''Arab'' came to carry a broader meaning than the original ethnic term: ''cultural'' Arab vs. ''ethnic'' Arab. People in [[Sudan]], [[Egypt]], [[Culture of Morocco|Morocco]], [[Algeria]] and elsewhere became Arab through [[Arabization]].

[[Arab nationalism]] declares that Arabs are united in a shared history, culture and language. Arab nationalists believe that Arab identity encompasses more than outward physical characteristics, [[race]] or [[religion]]. A related ideology, [[Pan-Arabism]], calls for all Arab lands to be united as one [[state]]. Arab nationalism has often competed for existence with regional and ethnic nationalisms in the Middle East, such as Lebanese and Egyptian.

[[Anti-Arabism]] is hate or prejudice against Arabs.  It is usually also associated with anti-Muslim hatred.

== Traditional genealogy ==
Medieval Arab [[genealogist]]s divided the Arabs into three groups:
* the &quot;ancient Arabs&quot;, tribes that had vanished or been destroyed, such as [['Ad]] and [[Thamud]]; they are often alluded to in the [[Qur'an]] as examples of God's power to destroy wicked peoples.
*the &quot;Pure Arabs&quot; of South Arabia, descending from [[Qahtan]].  The [[Qahtanite]]s (Qahtanis) are said to have migrated the land of [[Yemen]] following the destruction of the [[Ma'rib Dam]] (''sadd Ma'rib''). The Qahtanite Arabs created the ancient civilizations of Yemen, notably the [[Sabaean]]s (known in the Bible as [[Sheba]].)
*The &quot;Arabized Arabs&quot; (''musta`ribah'') of North Arabia, descending from [[Adnan]].

The [[Arabic language]] spoken today in classical Quranic form was the result of a mix between the original Arabic of Qahtan and northern Arabic which shares a great deal with northern Semitic languages from the [[Levant]]. The Arabs take a great pride in their language and its survival as a usable and comprehensible language for over thousand years.

In Jewish and Christian traditions the [[Ishmaelites]] were described as an &quot;Arabian people&quot; at least by the time of Josephus, which became standard centuries prior to Islam (in which the term ''Hagarenes'', a pun on the Arabic ''[[muhajir]]'' and the name of [[Hagar]], was commonly used).  Efforts to reconcile the Biblical and Arab genealogies later led to conflicting attempts to trace Adnan to [[Ishmael]] (Ismail), the eldest son of [[Abraham]] and [[Hagar]]. [[Joktan]] was identified with Qahtan, probably due to his Biblical identification as the ancestor of Hazarmaveth ([[Hadramawt]]) and [[Sheba]].

== Etymology ==
{{main|Etymology of the word Arab}}
The term &quot;Arab&quot; or &quot;Arabian&quot; (and cognates in other languages) has been used to translate several different but similar sounding names of ancient peoples of the Middle East which do not necessarily have the same meaning or origin. The etymology of the term is of course closely linked to that of the place name &quot;Arabia&quot;. The root of the word has many meanings in Semitic languages including &quot;west / sunset&quot;, &quot;desert&quot;, &quot;mingle&quot;, &quot;merchant&quot;, &quot;raven&quot;, &quot;comprehensible&quot; all of which appear to have some relevance to the emergence of the name.

{{Otheruses2|armadillo}}
'''Armadillos''' are any of several small [[mammal]]s of the family '''Dasypodidae''',  mostly known for having a bony [[armor]] shell. Their average size is about 75 [[centimeter]]s (30 inches), including tail. All species are native to the [[Americas|American]] continents, where they inhabit a variety of environments. In the United States, the sole resident armadillo is the 9-banded armadillo ''(Dasypus novemcinctus)'', which is most common in the central southern states, particularly [[Texas]].

Armadillos are [[placenta]]l mammals in the order [[Xenarthra]], related to the [[anteater]]s and sloths. There are several species of armadillo, some of which are distinguished by how many bands they have on their armor. The nine-banded form can not roll itself into a ball. They mainly run away or burrow from predators .
They are prolific diggers, and many species use their sharp claws to dig for food such as [[grub]]s and/or to dig dens. The 9-banded armadillo prefers to build burrows in moist soil near the creeks, streams, and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] near which it generally lives and feeds. The diet of armadillo species varies, but consists mainly of [[insect]]s, grubs, and other [[invertebrate]]s. Some species, however, are almost entirely termite/ant specialists.

The armor is formed by plates of dermal bone covered in small, overlapping , epidermal scales called ''[[scute]]s''.  This armor-like skin would appear to be the main defense of many armadillos, though, in fact, most flee predators by running and/or digging rather than relying on their armor.  Only the South American 3-banded armadillo (''[[Tolypeutes]]'') tends to rely heavily on its armor. When threatened by a [[predator]], Tolypeutes frequently will roll up into a ball. Other armadillo species cannot roll up because they have too many plates to curl. Instead, other armadillos will sometimes escape predators by running into thorny brush, relying  on their armor to protect them from the thorns. The North American 9-banded armadillo tends to jump straight in the air when surprised, and consequently often smacks itself into the undercarriage of cars passing over it.

Armadillos are often used in the study of [[leprosy]], since they, along with [[mice]], are the only known non-human animal species that can contract the disease systemically. They are particularly susceptible due to their unusually low body temperature, which is hospitable to the leprosy [[bacterium]] ([[Mycobacterium leprae]]). 

The 9-banded armadillos also serve science through their unusual reproductive system, in which four identical quadruplets (all the same sex) are born in each clutch of armadillos.  Because they are always identical, the group of four armadillos provide good subjects for scientific, behavioral, or medical tests that need consistent biological and genetic makeup in the testees.  This phenomenon of multiple identical birth, called ''[[polyembryony]]'', only manifests in the genus ''Dasypus'', not all armadillos as is commonly believed.

The armadillo was, over some resistance, made the state small mammal of Texas[http://www.shgresources.com/tx/symbols/smallmammal/]where it is considered a pest. In Maine, it is illegal to own an armadillo.

Armadillos can be kept as pets, although they require moist ground in which to dig and catch insects. They are difficult to domesticate fully.

==Trivia/interesting facts==
*In the [[Joe R. Lansdale]] novel ''Captains Outrageous'', a [[Texan]] armadillo named Bob is kept as a pet by Leonard Pine, one of the central characters.
*Because of the weight of its armor, an armadillo will sink in water unless it inflates its stomach with air, which often doubles its size.[http://www.flex.net/~lonestar/armadillo.htm]  
*A number of towns in Texas hold beauty pageants for armadillos.  [http://www.oaklaketrails.com/armadillo/armadillo.htm]
*''[[Glyptotherium texanum]]'' (extinct) was a close cousin of the armadillo, living in the tropical and subtropical regions of Florida, South Carolina, and Texas. It had a six-foot-long carapace and weighed in at approximately 2,000 pounds (1 ton).[http://www.amnh.org/science/biodiversity/extinction/Resources/Bestiary/Xenarthra.html]
*[[Bonobo]] chimpanzees and armadillos are the only mammals other than humans that engage in intercourse in the [[missionary position]] (face-to-face).
*German POWs in Texas would often refer to the armadillo as &quot;panzer swine&quot;.
*Recorded to be the animal with the most dreams in sleep.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- Note. 
If you intend to insert something to the effect: Arabs view this term as [[oxymoronic]], as they themselves are [[semites]] - Please read the section [[#Usage]] first. 
--&gt;
This article describes issues of '''[[anti-Semitism]]''' (hostility towards or discrimination against [[Jew]]s) in the '''[[Arab world]]'''.

[[Jewish diaspora|Jewish communities]] existed as a [[minority]] in the lands where the Arabs were the predominant population for at least 2,600 years, since the [[Babylonian captivity]] ([[597 BC|597 BCE]]). Since then, at various times and places, there have been periods of intense anti-Semitism and other periods of peaceful coexistence. 

In the course of the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], alleged and actual anti-Semitism has been a recurring issue in Arab countries, even as most of the Jewish population of these countries [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|has fled or been forced to leave]].  

== Usage ==
A person who exibits anti-Semitic behavior may be of any ancestry, including a Jew or an Arab. For example, [[Johannes Pfefferkorn]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Bobby Fischer]] had Jewish ancestry, but are often considered to be anti-Semites. ''See related [[anti-Semitism#Etymology and usage|Etymology and usage of the term anti-Semitism]].''

Some reject being labelled as &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;, claiming that their behavior is based on [[anti-Zionism]]. 
''See related [[Anti-Semitism#Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism|Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism]] and [[New anti-Semitism]].''

==History of Arab anti-Semitism before 1948==
Starting with the expansion of Islam in the first millennia, Jews, along with [[Christian]]s and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], typically had the legal status of [[dhimmi]] in Arab lands. As such, they were entitled to limited rights, tolerance, and protection, on the condition they pay a special poll tax (the &quot;[[jizya]]&quot;), which exempted them from military service, and also from payment of the [[Zakat]] alms tax required of Muslims.  As dhimmi, Jews were typically subjected to several restrictions, the application and severity of which varied by time and place: residency in segregated quarters, obligation to wear distinctive clothing, public subservience to Muslims, prohibitions against proselytizing and marrying Muslim women, and limited access to the legal systems. They sometimes attained high positions in government, notably as [[vizier]]s and [[physician]]s. Jewish communities, like Christian ones, were typically constituted as semi-autonomous entities managed by their own laws and leadership, who carried the responsibility for the community towards the Muslim rulers.  

Anti-Semitism in the [[Islamic world|Muslim world]] increased in the [[twentieth century]], as anti-Semitic propaganda and [[blood libel]]s were imported from [[Europe]] and as resentment against [[Zionism|Zionist]] efforts in [[British Mandate of Palestine]] spread. While anti-Semitism has certainly been heightened by the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], there were an increasing number of [[pogrom]]s against Jews prior to the foundation of [[Israel]], including [[Nazi]]-inspired pogroms in [[Algeria]] in the 1930s, and massive attacks on the Jews in [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] in the 1940s (see [[Farhud]]). George Gruen attributes the increased animosity towards Jews in the [[Arab world]] to several factors including: The breakdown of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and traditional [[Islamic]] society; domination by Western [[colonialism|colonial powers]] under which Jews gained a disproportionatly large role in the commercial, professional, and administrative life of the region; the rise of [[Arab nationalism]], whose proponents sought the wealth and positions of local Jews through government channels; resentment over Jewish [[nationalism]] and the Zionist movement; and the readiness of unpopular [[regime]]s to [[scapegoat]] local Jews for political purposes.[http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl102.htm]

After the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], the [[Palestinian exodus]], the creation of the state of [[Israel]], and the independence of Arab countries from European control, conditions for Jews in the Arab world deteriorated.  Over the next few decades, almost all would flee the Arab world, some willingly, and some under threat (see [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]]). In [[1945]] there were between 758,000 and 866,000 Jews (see table below) living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,000. In some Arab states, such as [[Libya]] (which was once around 3% Jewish), the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.

==Arab anti-Semitism in the [[20th century|20th]] and 21st century==
===Saudi Arabia===
A Saudi government website initially stated that Jews would not be granted tourist visas to enter the country [http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/ny09_weiner/022604Saudi.html]; it has since removed this statement, and apologized for posting &quot;erroneous information&quot;. Members of religions other than Islam, including Jews, are not permitted to practice their religion publicly in Saudi Arabia; according to the U.S. State Department [http://www.uscirf.gov/countries/countriesconcerns/Countries/Saudi_Arabia.html], religious freedom &quot;does not exist&quot; in Saudi Arabia. [[Wahhabism]] is the official religion of Saudi Arabia, and the tenets of that religion are enforced by law.

Saudi Arabian media often attacks Jews in books and news articles.  Saudi Arabian government officials and state religious leaders often promote the idea that &quot;the Jews&quot; are conspiring to take over the entire world; as proof of their claims they publish and frequently cite the anti-Semitic forgery, ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' as factual.  The former King of Saudi Arabia allegedly gave visitors copies of both The Protocols and [[Mein Kampf]]. [http://www.yaf.org/speakers/op-ed/feder_semitism.html] In 2001, Arab Radio and Television of Saudi Arabia produced a 30-part television miniseries entitled &quot;Horseman Without a Horse&quot;, a dramatization of [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]. [http://www.adl.org/presrele/islme_62/4013_62.asp]

Saudi Arabian government-sponsored newspapers have published articles claiming that Al Qaeda's [[September 11]], [[2001]] attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon was actually carried out by &quot;the Jews&quot;, also &quot;the Zionists&quot;. 

Many Saudi government newspapers promote the idea that a Jewish conspiracy pressed American President George W. Bush to go to war against [[Iraq]].

Saudi Arabian government newspapers suggest that hatred of all Jews is justifiable.  &quot;Why are they (the Jews) hated by all the people which hosted them, such as Iraq and Egypt thousands years ago, and Germany, Spain, France and the UK, up to the days they gained of power over the capital and the press, in order to rewrite the history?&quot; (Al-Riyadh, Saudi government daily, [[April 15]], [[2002]], Turki 'Abdallah as-Sudayri, ''All of History is against Them'')

===Arab Newspapers===
Many [[Arab]] newspapers, such as [[Al-Hayat Al-Jadidah]], the Palestinian Authority's official newspaper, often write that &quot;the Jews&quot; control all the world's governments, and that &quot;the Jews&quot; plan [[genocide]] on all the Arabs in the [[West Bank]]. Others write less sensational stories, and states that Jews have too much of an influence in the [[United States|US]] government. Often the leaders of other nations are said to be controlled by Jews. 

Articles in many official Arab government newspapers (notably those of the [[Palestinian Authority]], [[Libya]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]) claim that ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', an infamous anti-Semitic [[forgery]], reflects actual facts, and thus points to an international Jewish conspiracy to [[global domination|take over the world]].

:&quot;[[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu's]] Plan completely matches the foundations of the greater [[Zionism|Zionist]] plan which is organized according to specific stages that were determined when the ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (document)|Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' was composed and when [[Theodor Herzl|Herzl]] along with [[Chaim Weizmann|Weizmann]] traveled around the world in order to determine the appropriate location for the implementation of this conspiracy,&quot; (official Palestinian Authority newspaper, Al-Hayat Al-Jadidah, [[November 30]], [[1997]])

:&quot;The Jews seek to conquer the world...We must expose the Zionist-Colonialist plot and its goals, which destroy not only our people but the entire world&quot; (PA Minister of Agriculture, [[Abdel Jawad Saleh]], quoted in [[Al-Hayat Al-Jadidah]], [[November 6]], [[1997]]) [http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/anti-semitism/pastatements.html]

The [[Egypt]]ian government run newspaper, Al-Akhbar, on [[29 April]] [[2002]], published an editorial denying [[the Holocaust]] as a fraud. The next paragraph decries the failure of the Holocaust to eliminate all of the Jews [http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&amp;Area=sd&amp;ID=SP37502]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
With regard to the fraud of the Holocaust… Many [[France|French]] studies have proven that this is no more than a fabrication, a lie, and a fraud!! That is, it is a 'scenario' the plot of which was carefully tailored, using several faked photos completely unconnected to the truth. Yes, it is a film, no more and no less. [[Hitler]] himself, whom they accuse of [[Nazism]], is in my eyes no more than a modest 'pupil' in the world of murder and bloodshed. He is completely innocent of the charge of frying them in the hell of his false Holocaust!!

The entire matter, as many French and [[Britain|British]] scientists and researchers have proven, is nothing more than a huge Israeli plot aimed at extorting the [[Germany|German]] government in particular and the European countries in general. But I, personally and in light of this imaginary tale, complain to Hitler, even saying to him from the bottom of my heart, 'If only you had done it, brother, if only it had really happened, so that the world could sigh in relief [without] their evil and sin.'
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===9/11 conspiracy theories ===
: ''Main: [[9/11 conspiracy theories#Claims related to Jews and Israel|9/11 conspiracy theories: claims related to Jews and Israel]]
Across the Arab world, a fair number of Arab media outlets, some government-sponsored (such as those of [[Libya]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], and some of those of the [[Palestinian Authority]]), published pieces alleging that the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] were carried out by Jews, Zionists, Israelis, or even Americans.  Many within the Arab world viewed this terrorist act as a conspiracy to make the world hate all Arabs, and therefore believed that people perceived to be enemies of the Arabs must really be to blame; many others disagreed. After Al Qaeda acknowledged their role publicly, these claims lost credibility, and came to be widely seen as a [[conspiracy theory]].  Such theories are also found outside the Arab world, including in the United States.

=== The Palestinian Authority's view of Israel ===
Some people claim that the [[Palestinian Authority]]'s hostility to [[Israel]] constitutes anti-Semitism in itself; others regard this claim as absurd, noting that hostility to an enemy nation need not imply hostility to the associated ethnicity, and that the Palestinian Authority includes representatives from [[Neturei Karta]] (an extremely small group of [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] ''[[Haredi]]'' Jews with views considered extreme by most Jews).

Examples of hostility to Israel follow, as translated by [[MEMRI]]:

:The Palestinian Authority's official television channel has shows which teach 6 and 7 year old kids to kill Israelis. Episodes of a program called ''The Children's Club,'' broadcast in early 1998, showed a group of young Arab children, one of whom stood up, raised her fist, and shouted: “When I wander into Jerusalem, I will turn into a [[suicide]] warrior in battle dress! In battle dress!”  She was cheered and applauded by the other children in the group, and their adult leader declared, “Bravo! Bravo!” On another segment, a young girl sang: “Each and every part of your soil I have drenched with all my blood. And we shall march as warriors of [[Jihad]]. Oh, my exalted [[martyr]], you are my example. Oh, my sister, sing constantly about my life as a suicide warrior, how we remain steadfast. On, my country, you are my soul.” (Videotape of ''The Children's Club'', Peace for Generations, [[Jerusalem]], 1998)

An investigation by ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' ([[September 7]], [[1997]]) found children's programs on PA television in which an 8 year-old girl was shown singing: “I am a daughter of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. [[Qur'an]] in my right hand, in my left — a knife,” and another in which a young girl recites a poem she said she wrote for [[Yassir Arafat]]: “I am finished practicing on the [[submachine gun]] of return... We swear to take vengeful blood from our enemies for our killed and wounded. We will board a bustling boat which will take us to [[Jaffa, Israel|Jaffa]].” On the show, the girl then approached Arafat, who kissed her on both cheeks. ''The Inquirer'' continued:

:&quot;In a show about the opening of Palestinian schools, girls in frilly white dresses were shown dancing with [[Kalashnikov]] rifles that they twirled like batons. In another broadcast, a schoolboy, asked what he got out of summer camp, answered: 'I am defending the homeland and undergo training like army drills.' &quot;

:&quot;There is a children's quiz show about great figures in Palestinian history &amp;mdash; many of whom are considered heroes by Palestinians, but [[terrorism|terrorists]] by Israelis. One show featured [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]], a [[shaikh]] who was killed by the British in 1935. The military wing of [[Hamas]], which has carried out many terrorist bombings in Israel, was named for Qassam. The heroine of another episode was [[Dalal al-Maghribi]], a woman who commanded a bus hijacking near [[Haifa]] in 1978. Thirty-four Israelis and nine Palestinian commandos, Maghribi among them, were killed. The quiz-show emcee referred to Maghribi as &quot;our sacred martyr.&quot;

Senior PA officials also regularly engage in hostile [[propaganda]] against Israel, and Arafat has taken no action against them. For example, the Deputy Minister of the PA Ministry of Supplies has accused Israel of giving Palestinian Arabs “food containing material that causes [[cancer]] and [[hormone]]s that harm male virility and other spoiled food products in order to poison and harm the Palestinian population.” ([[Yediot Ahronot]], [[June 25]], [[1997]])

The [[PLO]]'s representative to the [[United Nations]] in [[Geneva]] has accused Israel of injecting “300 Palestinian children with [[HIV]].” ([[Jerusalem Post]], [[March 17]] [[1997]])

The director of the Inspection Department of the PA Ministry of Supplies has claimed that Israeli chewing gums sold in PLO-controlled areas “contain a sexually-stimulating [[adrenaline]] substance.” (Jerusalem Post, [[March 27]] [[1997]])

=== The [[Palestinian Authority]]'s view of Jews ===
Many senior PA officials and the PA-controlled media have also repeatedly made statements denigrating Jewish religious beliefs and Jewish history, such denying that modern Jews have any connection to the Jews in the Bible; that Jews have any historical connection to Jerusalem; and that the Western Wall has any religious significance in [[Judaism]]. (See ''[[Israeli-Palestinian history denial]]'' for details.) These same PA officials and the PA-controlled media have also repeatedly made statements distorting or denying [[the Holocaust]].

In some cases, they have claimed that Jews invented the “myth” of [[Nazi]] genocide in order to gain world sympathy and reparations money. In other instances, they have acknowledged that some Jews were murdered by the Nazis, but charged that Jews vastly exaggerated the death toll for political purposes. 

[[Mahmoud Abbas]] (Abu Mazen), Arafat's number-two man and the architect of the [[Oslo Accords]], is the author of a book claiming that the Nazis may have really killed less than one million Jews. (Jerusalem Post, [[January 26]], [[1995]]) Numerous senior PA officials, [[Left-Wing]] and [[Right-wing]] Americans, Israeli Soldiers and Jewish intellectuals have also compared Israel to the Nazis, in one noted case declaring that Israel's treatment of Arabs is even worse than the Nazis' treatment of Jews, although such a claim is generally perceived as a tremendous exaggeration in light of factual realities.

===[[Hizbullah]]'s [[Al-Manar]] TV channel===
Jewish groups and European observers allege that [[Hizbullah]]'s [[Al-Manar]] TV channel frequently airs [[antisemitic]] broadcasts, blaming the Jews for a Zionist [[conspiracy]] against the Arab world, and often airing excerpts from the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], which the Encyclopædia Britannica describes as a &quot;fraudulent document that served as a pretext and rationale for anti-Semitism in the early 20th century.&quot;.

Al-Manar recently aired a drama series, called &quot;The Diaspora&quot;, which observers allege is based on historical anti-Semitic allegations. [[BBC]] reporters who watched the series said that: &lt;blockquote&gt; Correspondents who have viewed The Diaspora note that it quotes extensively from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a notorious 19th Century publication used by the Nazis among others to fuel race hatred.  [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3581514.stm] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another incident, an Al-Manar commentator recently referred to &quot;Zionist attempts to transmit [[AIDS]] to Arab countries&quot;.  Al-Manar officials deny broadcasting anti-Semitic incitement and state that their position is anti-Israeli, not anti-Semitic.

Due to protests by the [[CRIF]] umbrella group of French Jews regarding allegations of anti-Semitic content, [[France|French]] Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] called for a ban on Al-Manar broadcasting in France on [[December 2]], [[2004]]; just two weeks after al-Manar was authorised to continue broadcasting in Europe by France's media watchdog agency. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4064317.stm]

On [[December 13]], [[2004]], [[France]]'s highest administrative court banned [[Hizbullah]]'s ''Al-Manar'' TV station on the grounds that it consistently incites racial hatred and [[antisemitism]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4093579.stm (BBC)]

On [[December 17]], [[2004]], The United States followed the lead of the French government, and placed Al-Manar on the [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]]. This measure was aimed at forcing the companies which currently transmit Al-Manar to the United States via [[satellite]] to drop the controversial station or face criminal prosecution.

===Anti-Semitic laws and policies in Arab countries===
The [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] Ministry of Tourism announced on its web site in early 2004, that visas to enter the country will not be issued to &quot;Jewish people.&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3493448.stm].

The [[Jordan]]ian Nationality Law of 1954 states that &quot;Any man in the [[West Bank]] will be a Jordanian subject if he is not Jewish.&quot;

== Quotes ==
* &quot;The volume of anti-Semitic books and articles published, the size and number of editions and impressions, the eminence and authority of those who write, publish and sponsor them, their place in school and college curricula, their role in the mass media, would all seem to suggest that classical anti-Semitism is an essential part of Arab intellectual life at the present time-almost as much as happened in Nazi Germany, and considerably more than in late nineteenth and early twentieth century France.&quot; (Bernard Lewis, ''Semites and Antisemites'' New York/London: Norton, 1986, p. 286)

* The Jews have been amongst the most active advocates of destruction in many lands... It is well known that the disintegration of Russia was wholly or in great part brought about by the Jews, and a large proportion of the defeat of Germany and Austria must also be put at their door. (Musa Khazem El Husseini, Mayor of Jerusalem to Winston Churchill, March 1921, quoted in Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, Knopf 1999 Page 99)

* &quot;No more than 400,000 Jews were killed by the Nazis.&quot; &quot;It is well-known that every year the Jews exaggerate what the Nazis did to them,&quot; said the moderator of a cultural affairs program on Palestinian Authority Television, during an [[August 25]], [[1997]]. &quot;They claim there were 6 million killed, but precise scientific research demonstrates that there were no more than 400,000.&quot; 

* &quot;Zionists forged Holocaust claims.&quot; On [[September 3]] [[1997]], the PA newspaper Al-Hayat Al-Jadidah featured an article by Palestinian Arab author Nabil Salam, which declared: &quot;Since its establishment, the racist Zionist entity has been implementing various forms of terrorism on a daily basis which are a repetition of the Nazi terror. This proves the shared roots of Nazi and Zionist thought. This also explains the cooperation between the Jews and Nazis during World War II, through which was revealed the forged claims of the Zionists regarding the alleged acts of slaughter perpetrated against the Jews during the same period.&quot; 

* &quot;Zionists were partners with the Nazis in the Holocaust.&quot; Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), the number 2 official in the [[PLO]] and architect of the [[Oslo Accords]], authored and has refused to retract a book claiming that &quot;the [[Zionist]] movement was a partner in the massacre of the Jews.&quot; The book is entitled ''The Other Side: The Secret Relationship Between Nazism and the Zionist Movement'', and uses the statements of German Jewish Zionists who supported Hitler to suggest that they supported the Nazis, and thus [[the Holocaust]]. The book also claims that the Nazis may have really killed less than one million Jews, and that the rest were killed by Soviets. (Jerusalem Post, [[26 January]] [[1995]])

      <comment>moved [[Accidental properties]] to [[Accidental property]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Aristotle]] made a distinction between the ''[[essential properties|essential]]'' and ''accidental'' [[properties]] of a thing. An '''accidental property''' is one which has no necessary connection to the [[essence]] of the thing being described.

A trivial example may help to illustrate the distinction. It is an ''essential property'' of bachelors that they are unmarried, but it is an ''accidental property'' of bachelors that they have brown hair. This is because it is logically impossible to find a married bachelor anywhere in this or any other possible world, and therefore the property of being unmarried is an necessary or essential part of being a bachelor. On the other hand, brown hair is a ''contingent'' or accidental property of bachelors since some bachelors have brown hair and others do not. Even if for some reason all the unmarried men with non-brown hair were killed, and every single existent bachelor had brown hair, the property of having brown hair would still be accidental, since it is the case that in some possible world, a bachelor could have hair of another color.

There are various categories of accidental properties in Aristotle's logic, including number, quality, place, time, relation to other objects, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''arcology''' is an habitat or settlement, maintaining an extremely high human [[population density]]. The term was invented by architect [[Paolo Soleri]], as a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[architecture]]'' and ''[[ecology]]''. So far these constructs exist only conceptually with experiments taking place at [[Arcosanti]] in central Arizona, USA. Popular in science fiction, arcologies are generally advocated as solutions to the problems of [[overpopulation]] and [[environmental degradation]], as they reduce the footprint of cities.  Most cities spread across the Earth's surface horizontally — covering more and more land and reducing arable farmland.  Arcologies would be 'vertical cities,' or, more accurately, [[three dimensional cities]].

== Development of the arcology idea ==

According to Soleri, the basic idea of an arcology stems from the idea that [[urbanization]] is claiming an excessive amount of space on [[Earth]] and that an elegant, but little practiced option, is simply to use what land we have more wisely.  In ''&quot;Arcology: The City in the Image of Man'',&quot; Soleri describes ways of compacting our city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl.  While this led to many [[science fiction]] interpretations of [[domed city|domed cities]], Soleri's ideas aren't just the &quot;human beehive&quot; model popular in [[science fiction]].  They also encompass vast differences in societal thinking regarding some of the same things that [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] touched upon in [[transport]], [[agriculture]] and [[commerce]]. Soleri deepened Wright's ideas of what might specifically need to be done by exploring [[Factors of production|resource]] [[consumption]] and duplication, [[land reclamation]], elimination of most private transport in favor of [[public transport]] and greater use of social resources like [[public library|public libraries]]. This concept also emphasizes, in a broader scale, more efficient use of resources and compacting of urban space to preserve the environment. 

Some experts speculate that arcologies will become common in the [[information age]]. Construction methods for arcologies are being tested at [[Arcosanti]]. Otherwise, arcologies are restricted to paper proposals and fictional depictions, such as [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s [[Oath of Fealty]] (novel) or as elements in [[computer and video games]], such as ''[[SimCity 2000]]'', ''[[Escape Velocity Nova]]'', and ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]''.

The first arcology to be described in fiction was probably &quot;The Last Redoubt&quot; from ''[[The Night Land]]'' by [[William Hope Hodgson]], first published in 1912. It is a complete example of an arcology, including full artificial ecology, agriculture, and public transport by mobile roadways.

==Real-life visions==
Many cities in the world have had proposed or desired arcologies that never went far. [[Tokyo]] has had many, which are listed [http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/sk/li/?id=100297&amp;bt=8&amp;ht=2&amp;sro=1 here].

Apparently, a new &quot;eco-city&quot; or self-sustaining urban centre the size of a large western capital is to be built at [[Dongtan]] near [[Shanghai]] [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1635188,00.html]. The first phase is on target to open by 2010 and to be &quot;completed&quot; by 2040.

== Arcology in popular culture ==
The computer game ''[[SimCity 2000]]'' allows the construction of four different types of arcologies, with different models becoming available as the years pass. The most primitive model holds relatively few people and produces considerable pollution, while later models are clean and efficient.

A level of the computer game ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'' posits a futuristic arcology on the edge of an ancient [[Medina quarter|medina]] in [[Cairo]].

Arcologies are common elements in futuristic [[anime]] and [[manga]] titles. An example would be the [[post-apocalyptic]]/[[cyberpunk]] series ''[[Appleseed]]'' by [[Masamune Shirow]], in which arcologies dominate the skyline of the city Olympus.

In the 1982 [[cyberpunk]] film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' by [[Ridley Scott]], the main offices of the fictional Tyrell Corporation are located in an arcology; The Genom Tower arcologies (among other things) in the [[anime]] ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]'' were partially inspired by the Tyrell arcology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Amstrad CPC464.jpg|right|thumb|370px|Amstrad CPC 464, with CTM644 colour monitor]]

The '''Amstrad CPC''' was a series of [[8-bit]] [[home computer]]s produced by [[Amstrad]] during the [[1980s]] and early [[1990s]]. CPC stood for 'Colour Personal Computer', although it was possible to purchase a CPC with a [[green screen]] (GT65/66) as well as with the standard colour screen (CTM640). 
The first machine, the CPC 464 was introduced in [[1984]]. It was designed to be a direct competitor to the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Sinclair Research Ltd|Sinclair]] [[ZX Spectrum]] systems. 

Outwardly, the most distinguishing features of Amstrad's offering were the matte black console case with sharp corners and narrowly rectangular form factor (the latter due to the built-in [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tape]] deck ('''CPC 464''') or [[Floppy_drive#The_3-inch_compact_floppy_disk|floppy disk drive]] ('''CPC 664''' and '''CPC 6128'''), the keyboard's distinctly coloured special keys (all the non-typewriter-standard keys), and the unique power supply hookup with one lead going from the console to the monitor (or RF modulator) and one lead going the other way. A television could be used with an optional adapter. 

==The Amstrad CPC sold as a &quot;complete system&quot;==
[[Image:Amstrad CPC Advert.png|right|thumb|UK advert for the Amstrad&amp;nbsp;CPC&amp;nbsp;464]]
Amstrad initially promoted the CPC as being an improvement on the competing [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[C64]] because it was a '''complete system''' - including everything required to use the machine in one box. Compared to a C64 or a ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPCs shipped with their own monitor, had a built in tape recorder or floppy disk drive and even a small loudspeaker. This marketing gave a more &quot;professional&quot; appeal to the Amstrad CPC by marketing it in the same way as business-oriented systems, rather than gaming or home oriented ones.

As a late entrant to the European 8-bit market, the CPC range never achieved the sales volume of either the ZX Spectrum or the C64, but the advantages of a proper typewrite-style keyboard and integrated tape or floppy drive saw it obtain considerable market share in the late 80s. Despite strong competition in the UK, it became the most popular and best-selling computer in France at this time.

==The CPC family==
===The Amstrad CPC 464, 472, 664, 6128===
The original CPC was sold in the following configurations:

*'''CPC 464''' &amp;ndash; [[Compact audio cassette|Tape deck]], 64 [[kilobyte|KB]] [[random access memory|RAM]], square-edged keyboard
*'''CPC 472''' &amp;ndash; Tape deck, 72K RAM (although the extra 8K of RAM cannot be used); produced in small numbers for the Spanish market to avoid a legal ruling requiring that all computers with 64 KB or less RAM must be localized to the Spanish language, including the keyboard and screen messages.
*'''CPC 664''' &amp;ndash; [[Floppy_drive#The_3-inch_compact_floppy_disk|3&quot; Floppy disk drive]], 64K RAM, bowed keyboard; short-lived model, quickly replaced by the better-specified 6128
*'''CPC 6128''' &amp;ndash; 3&quot; Floppy disk drive, 128K RAM (accessed using [[bank switching]]), more PC-like keyboard

External disk drives such as the DDI-1/FD-1 were available for the 464. A cassette adapter was available for the 664 and 6128. All 128K models were [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with the 64K variants. A third-party hardware addon, the [[Multiface]], allowed backup of most tape software to disk.

Most games and software targeted the 64K RAM 464 and 664 models. Only a handful of titles exclusively targeted the 128K machines.

The memory layout of the system allowed the CPCs to run [[CP/M|CP/M 2.2]] and CP/M software adapted especially for the machines was not uncommon. An Amstrad-specific variant of CP/M 3.0 (aka CP/M Plus) was developed for the 6128 and used in later years.

===West Germany: Schneider CPC 464, 664 and 6128===
Amstrad's German partner company '''Schneider''' produced its own models of the CPC 464, 664 and 6128. These machines had grey keys in place of the Amstrad coloured alternatives and an industry standard [[Micro ribbon|Centronics]] port in place of the expansion edge connector but were otherwise identical at the hardware level. Documentation and case labels were translated into German.

===East Germany: KC compact===
Like most other computers of the era, the CPC inspired a clone in the [[Eastern bloc]], the '''[[KC compact]]''' made in [[East Germany]] using Russian and East German components.

The machine differed from a CPC visually with a different style of case, external power supply and (optional and even more scarce than the main device) external 5.25&quot; 'Robotron' disc drive. Unlike the Amstrad models it could be used with a television screen out of the box. It ran BASIC 1.1 and a CP/M 2.6 clone, the German speaking MicroDOS. It had 64K RAM built in and an additional 64K RAM was provided with the external disc/tape drive adapter. 

The Z80 processor was replaced with a U 880 (which is 100% bug-compatible), and some proprietary Amstrad I/O chips replaced with clones based on the Z8536. This clone machine was around 95% compatible with the original.

===The CPC 5512===
The &quot;CPC 5512&quot; was a non-functional [[hoax|fake]] concocted by a French magazine; the specifications included 512K RAM, a 5.25&quot; floppy disk drive, and GEM on a CPC 6128 clone.

===PLUS models===
In 1990 Amstrad introduced the &quot;Plus&quot; series which tweaked the hardware in many ways and added a [[Cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]] slot to all models. Most improvements were to the video display which saw an increase in palette to 4096 colours and gained a capacity for [[Sprite (computer graphics)|hardware sprites]]. Splitting the display into two separate windows and [[pixel]] scrolling both became full supported hardware features although both were possible on the non-&quot;Plus&quot; hardware using clever programming of the existing [[Motorola 6845]].

An automatic DMA transfer system for feeding the sound chip was also added but the sound chip itself remained unchanged. Additionally, the BASIC command set for disc access was improved.

A cut down CPC+ without the keyboard nor support for non-cartridge media was released simultaneously as the [[Amstrad_GX4000|'''GX4000''']] [[video game console]].

These models did not do very well in the marketplace, failing to attract any substantial third party support. The 8-bit technology behind the CPC was starting to look a little out of date by 1990 and users resented the substantial price hike for cartridge games compared to their tape and disc counterparts.

==Hardware description==
All CPC models were based on a [[Zilog Z80]] processor clocked at 4 MHz. Because a common pool of RAM is shared with the video circuits, the Z80 may only make a memory accesses every four cycles - which has the effect of rounding all instruction cycle lengths up to the next multiple of four.

The system came with 64 KB or 128 KB of RAM depending on the model (capable of being expanded to 512k). The machines also featured a standard 9-pin [[Atari]]-style [[joystick]] socket which was able to take two joysticks via a splitter.

===Video (graphics): modes, outputs===
Underlying the CPCs video output was the [[Motorola 6845]] address generator. This chip was connected to a pixel generator that supported 4 bpp, 2 bpp and 1 bpp output (bpp = [[color depth|bits per pixel]]). The address generator was clocked at a constant rate so the 4 bpp display generated half as many pixels as the 2 bpp and a quarter as many as the 1 bpp.

The [[Read-only memory|ROM]] featured three built-in display resolutions but many others could be achieved by reprogramming the 6845.

The standard video modes were:
*'''Mode 0''': '''160×200''' pixels with 16 colors (4 [[color depth|bpp]])
*'''Mode 1''': '''320×200''' pixels with 4 colors (2 bpp)
*'''Mode 2''': '''640×200''' pixels with 2 colors (1 bpp)

A colour [[palette]] of 27 colors was supported, derived from [[RGB]] colour space with each component assigned as either off, half on or on. The later '''Plus''' models extended this to 4096 colours and added support for hardware sprites.

This hardware compares well with the other 8-bit computers. In particular the CPC lacks the colour clash of the ZX Spectrum and clever programming of the 6845 could produce [[overscan]], different resolutions (although with the same pixel density) and smooth pixel scrolling.

The machine lacked either an [[RF modulator|RF TV]] or [[composite video]] output and instead shipped with a proprietary 5-pin [[DIN connector]] intended for use solely with the supplied Amstrad monitor. An external adapter for RF TV was available to be bought separately.

The five-pin DIN connector is capable of driving a [[SCART]] television with a correctly wired lead.

===Audio (sound)===
The CPC used the [[General Instruments AY-3-8912]] [[sound chip]], providing three channels, each configurable to generate square waves, white noise or both. A small array of hardware volume envelopes are available.

Output was provided in mono by a small (4 [[Metre#SI_multiples|cm]]) built-in loudspeaker with volume control, driven by an unusually powerful [[amplifier]]. [[Stereophonic sound|Stereo]] output was provided through a 3.5mm [[headphones]] jack, not present on some early CPC464 models. In those models, what looked like a standard 3.5&quot; headphone jack was actually used for connecting an external tape recorder, although later models used a five-pin DIN connector for the same purpose.

Playback of [[digital sampling|digital sound sample]]s at a resolution of a little better than 5-bit, as heard on the title screen of the game ''[[RoboCop (videogame)|RoboCop]]'', was possible through clever programming of the sound chip. This trick was very processor intensive and hard to combine with any other processing.

===The 3&quot; floppy disk drives===
[[Image:Compact Floppy.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px| The CF has a harder casing than a 3&amp;frac12;&quot; floppy; the metal door is opened by a sliding plastic tab on the right side.]]

Amstrad's idiosyncratic choice of [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi's]] 3&quot; floppy disk drive, when the rest of the PC industry was moving to [[Sony]]'s 3.5&quot; format, is often claimed to be due to Amstrad bulk-buying a large consignment of 3&quot; drive units in [[Asia]]. The cheapest drive (built-in in later models) was a single-sided 40-track unit that required the user to physically remove and flip the disk to access both sides. Each side had its own independent write-protect switch. The sides were termed &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, with each one holding 180KB (178KB in [[AMSDOS]] format) for a total of 360KB per disc.  

The interface with the drives was a NEC 765 [[Floppy disk controller|FDC]], used for the same purpose in the IBM [[PC/XT]], [[PC/AT]] and [[PS/2]] machines. Many of its features were unused in order to cut costs, namely [[DMA]] transfers and support for [[single density]] disks; they were formatted as [[double density]] using [[Modified frequency modulation]]. 

Disks were shipped in a paper sleeve or a hard plastic case resembling a [[compact disc]] &quot;jewel&quot; case. The casing is thicker and more rigid than that of 3.5&quot; diskettes and sliding metal cover to protect the media surface is internal to the casing and latched, unlike the simple external sliding cover of Sony's version (some reviews at the time reported driving over them with no problems). Because of this they were significantly more expensive than both 5.25&quot; and 3.5&quot; alternatives. This, combined with their low nominal capacities and their essentially proprietary nature, lead to the format being discontinued when the CPC itself was discontinued.

Apart from Amstrad's other 3&quot; machines (the [[Amstrad PCW|PCW]] and ZX Spectrum +3), the only other computer systems to use them were mostly obscure and exotic CP/M systems such as the [[Tatung Einstein]] and [[Osborne 1|Osborne]] machines.

The data formatting of 3&quot; disks was very similar to that of 5&amp;frac14;&quot; disks, and the Amstrad CPC machines were able to use 5&amp;frac14;&quot; drives through their &quot;external drive&quot; port - either one specially designed for use by the CPC or an adapted IBM-PC drive.

A more popular alternative was to attach an adapted IBM-PC 3&amp;frac12;&quot; drive for operation in either single-sided 180 KB or double-sided 360 KB mode, although with the later availability of the PARADOS Disc Operating System, 720k per disc became available.

===Serial port adaptor===
An official [[RS-232|RS-232-C]] [[D-subminiature|D25]] serial port adaptor was produced that attached to the expansion connector at the rear of the machine, and had a through-connector for the CPC464 disk drive or other peripherals. The adaptor came with a &quot;''Book of Spells''&quot; for facilitating data transfer between other systems using a proprietary [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] in the device's own ROM, as well as [[computer terminal|terminal]] software to connect to British Telecom's [[Prestel]] service. A separate version of the ROM was created for the U.S. market due to the use of the commands &quot;SUCK&quot; and &quot;BLOW&quot;, which were considered unacceptable there.

===Similarities to the BBC Micro===
The CPC has been termed an &quot;improved Z80 implementation of the (earlier) [[BBC Micro]]&quot; due to similarities in [[firmware]] and hardware. Both use the Motorola 6845 video address generator and the two have very similar sound output chips - the General Instrument AY-3-8912 in the CPC provides three tone channels each optionally with added noise and the [[Texas Instruments SN76489]] in the BBC offers three tone channels and one exclusive noise channel.

The BBC Micro uses an [[Intel]] 8271 floppy disc controller. The CPC uses the Intel 8272, which is similar to the 8271 but contains the addition of a double density ([[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]]) mode.

The &quot;two cursor&quot; BASIC editing system seen on the Amstrad CPC (whereby holding Shift and using the cursor keys moves a shadow text [[Cursor_(computers)|cursor]] allowing text to be copied from another area of the screen to the normal cursor) is a lift from [[BBC BASIC]], albeit substantially improved by allowing free movement of the normal cursor.

Both systems provide similar systems of full hardware abstraction through [[Operating System]] calls. This saves programs which don't require time critical hardware access from having to touch the underlying machine and provides a level of machine portability for those programs.

==Software==
===Built-in BASIC and operating system===
Like most home computers at the time, the CPC had its [[operating system|OS]] and a [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] built in as [[read-only memory|ROM]]. It used [[Locomotive BASIC]] - a variant specifically written for the CPC hardware which as a result was faster, more comfortable and more powerful than the generic but common [[Microsoft BASIC]] used by the Commodore 64 and [[MSX]] amongst others. It was particularly notable for providing easy access to the machine's video and audio resources in contrast to the arcane [[PEEK and POKE|POKE]] commands required on some Microsoft implementations (the MSX implementation of Microsoft Basic being an exception, which even allowed for hardware sprite manipulation and collision detection).

===Other languages===
Although it was possible to obtain compilers for Locomotive BASIC, [[C programming language|C]] and [[Pascal]] the majority of the CPC's software was written in native Z80a assembly language.

An interpreter for the educational language [[Logo programming language|LOGO]] was also available.

===Criticism of CPC software (games)===
The quality of CPC software has been sometimes criticized due to the existence of games that were simply a ZX Spectrum port, thus not measuring up to the equivalent ZX Spectrum or C64 implementations in terms of taking full advantage of the CPC capabilities.

Because the CPC shared the Z80a processor with the ZX Spectrum and could be made to produce a similar display from the same code, many games manufacturers developed games for the two systems in parallel or ported older Spectrum games yielding products that did not take advantage of hardware scrolling or the availability of 4 and 16 colour modes.

For those actually targeting the CPC the hardware lacked support for sprites and [[scrolling]] required some careful memory arrangement and was for a long time thought impossible to do smoothly in the vertical direction. This made the creation of smooth-running and colourful games harder. Titles from the late 80s onwards tended to be coded more carefully than their mid 80s counterparts, making better use of the machine's graphics capabilities, featuring smooth scrolling and better color usage.

Although the machine received more software support than most other Z80-based systems, the overall impression left is that the commercial success of the system could have been a bit better.

Games featuring poor scrolling, quasi-monochrome Spectrum-like graphics and sluggish controls - specially in the beginning of the CPC's commercial lifespan - were marketed alongside others including smooth scrolling, colourful graphics and crisp music and sound effects which almost rivalled those of the C64, 

That said, it is important to remark that numerous software companies from that era, such as [[Ocean Software]], [[Elite]], [[Palace Software]], [[Incentive]], [[Hewson Consultants]], [[Loriciels]] or [[Dinamic Software]] among others released quality titles on a regular basis which kept CPC users more than happy with their ''Color Personal Computer''.

==Magazines==
[[Computer magazine|Magazine]]s available for the system (at various times) included ''[[Amtix]]'', ''[[Computing With The Amstrad]]'', ''[[Amstrad Computer User]]'' (Amstrad official publication), ''[[Amstrad Action]]'', and ''[[CPC Attack]]''.

==The Amstrad CPC vs. its competitors==
Since the Amstrad CPC was specifically built to compete with the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[C64]], and was a relatively late entrant into the [[1980s]] 8-bit [[home computer]] market, comparisons between those computer systems were very frequent on specialized magazines but also among players themselves. Also, the three machines were practically the most [[Computer software|software]]-wise supported 8-bit home computers in history, and had a virtually identical selection of games, although with major differences in quality, technical characteristics, and platform-dependant peculiarities. 

In general, C64 users were prone to snub both other competing machines as &quot;largely inferior&quot;, while a sort of hidden rivalry existed between ZX Spectrum and CPC users. The former considered the CPC to be just an overhyped clone of the their beloved Spectrum, while CPC users considered ZX Spectrum users as &quot;poor, jealous cousins&quot; who tainted their beloved machine with inferior game ports.

In fact, the C64 had in general better sound, graphics and scrolling than its competitors thanks to its dedicated hardware. It also had a wide selection of games designed to run from floppy disks, though C64 [[Commodore 64 peripherals|floppy drive]]s were notoriously slow. It also suffered from a poor built-in BASIC and was not ideal for users who wanted to learn to program in comparison to the other two machines.

The ZX Spectrum had the simplest hardware of all three, though this meant a lower price. As a result, it suffered from [[Attribute clash|colour clash]] and had very poor sound compared to the C64 and CPC (although later models of the ZX Spectrum used the same sound chip as the CPC). However, its many third-party peripherials and some aspects of its built-in BASIC made it more appealing for DIY enthusiasts and hobbyist programmers.

The Amstrad CPC had on paper better graphics capabilities than the ZX Spectrum, but a lot of its games were directly derived from their ZX Spectrum counterparts graphics-wise and sometimes sound-wise, which resulted in a long series of low quality titles which hurt the machine's reputation. Even when that was not the case, CPC titles rarely featured smooth scrolling or sprite handling due to programming complexities, although that was technically possible. Its sound chip was considered better than the simple beeper of early ZX Spectrum models, but not quite up to the par with the C64's [[MOS Technology SID|SID]] chip.

==Later Amstrad==
Ultimately, the company purchased [[Sinclair Research]], discontinuing the unsuccessful [[Sinclair QL]] 16-bit business machine and relaunching the 128KB Sinclair Spectrum in &quot;+2&quot; and &quot;+3&quot; variants with better keyboards and integral storage. The case and design of these recognisably drew from the CPC series.

==Hardware tricks on the CPC series==
Simple reprogramming of the Motorola 6845 CRTC could produce extended graphics modes up to 784×384 pixels through [[overscan]]. Careful timing of palette switches could theoretically allow all 27 hardware colours to be visible in any display mode but due to CPU burden, programs with unpredictable on screen motion (such as games) would typically only find time to change palette once or twice per frame.  It was also possible to change mode (hence resolution) thus allowing for example the screen to be split into a colourful playing area and a high resolution score area.  An example of a game doing this was Sorcery by Virgin Games [http://www.cpczone.net/reviews/index.php?title=699].

The CRTC could also be tricked into splitting the display along any horizontal line, allowing the video address to be arbitrarily changed at that point. This meant that it was possible to hardware scroll portions of the display while leaving others static.

The machine had an internal mechanical [[relay]] for controlling the tape recorder's motor which when switched would produce an audible click. Some software used this trick to produce &quot;realistic&quot; [[percussion instrument|percussion]] sounds, but usually such an abuse of the relay resulted in early failure.

Careful programming of the AY sound chip could cause it to produce a level wave. Adjustment of the output volume would cause related adjustments in the amplitude of the wave. Using this observation it was possible to output [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] digital audio at better than 5-bit quality, albeit at a very high CPU cost.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Abdulaziz al-Omari.png|right|frame|This photograph of Abdulaziz al-Omari was released by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in the days following the attack.]]
'''Abdulaziz al-Omari'''([[Arabic language|Arabic]]:&amp;#1593;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1583;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1593;&amp;#1586;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1586;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1593;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1585;&amp;#1610;, also [[transliteration|transliterated]] '''Abdul Aziz Alomari''') was named by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] as one of the [[Organizers of the September 11, 2001 attacks|hijackers]] of the [[American Airlines flight 11|first plane]] which was crashed into the [[World Trade Center]] in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

==History==
Little is known about al-Omari's life, and it is unclear whether some information refers to al-Omari or another person by that name. He has used birth dates of [[December 24]], [[1972]] and [[May 28]], [[1979]]. He came from [['Asir|Asir Province]], a poor region in southwestern [[Saudi Arabia]] that borders [[Yemen]]. According to a 2003 [[CIA]] report, he had graduated with honours from high school, attained a degree from the [[http://www.imamu.edu.sa/ Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud University]], was married, and had a daughter. 

He is said to have often served as an [[imam]] at his mosque in Saudi Arabia and is believed to have been a student of a radical Saudi cleric named [[Sulayman al Alwan]], whose mosque is located in [[Al Qasim]].[[Image:AlOmarisApplication.GIF|thumb|130px|Omari's Visa Application]]

According to [[Tawfiq bin Attash]], al-Omari was one of a group of future hijackers who provided security at Khandahar airport after their basic training at an al-Qaida camp. During the [[2000 Al Qaeda Summit]] in [[Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia]], immigration records show that a person named Abdulaziz al-Omari was visiting the country, although it is unknown whether this was the same person.

[[Image:AbdulazizonAlJazeera.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Omari in the farewell video]]In the spring of 2001, al-Omari made a farewell video that was later shown on [[al Jazeera]]. In it, he reads &quot;I am writing this with my full conscience and I am writing this in expectation of the end, which is near. . . God praise everybody who trained and helped me, namely the leader Sheik [[Osama bin Laden]].&quot;

According to [[FBI]] director [[Robert Mueller]] and the [[9/11 Commission]], al-Omari entered the United States through a [[London]] or [[Dubai]] flight on [[May 28]] with [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]] and [[Mohand al-Shehri]].

On [[June 29]], [[2001]], al-Omari travelled to the U.S. for the first time, landing in [[New York]]. He had used the controversial [[Visa Express]] program to gain entry. He apparently stayed with several other hijackers in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], before moving to his own place at 4032 57th Terrace, [[Vero Beach]] Florida.  On his rental agreement form for that house, Omari gave two license-plates authorized to park in his space, one of which was registered to Atta.[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/atta/resources/documents/fbiaffidavit11.htm]

al-Omari occasionally trained on simulators at the [[FlightSafety Aviation School]] in [[Vero Beach, Florida]] together with [[Mohand al-Shehri]] and [[Saeed Al-Ghamdi]]

==The Attack==
[[Image:Atta atm.jpg|right|thumb|Abdulaziz al-Omari (center) and [[Mohamed Atta al Sayed]] withdrawing money from an ATM]]On [[September 10]], [[Mohamed Atta al Sayed]] picked up Omari from the [[Milner Hotel]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and the two drove [[1n4dl01d81c212547|their rented Nissan]] to a [[Comfort Inn]] in [[Portland, Maine|South Portland, Maine]], where they spent the night in room 232 for unknown reasons, although it was within sight of [[Portland International Jetport]].  It was initially reported that [[Adnan Bukhari|Adnan]] and [[Ameer Bukhari]] were the two hijackers who had rented and driven the car.[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200109/13/eng20010913_80131.html][[Image:Atta in airport.jpg|left|thumb|Atta (blue shirt) and al-Omari in the [[Portland, Maine]] airport on the morning of 9/11]] The two spent their last night pursuing ordinary activities: making an ATM withdrawal, a shared meal at [[Pizza Hut]], and a 20-minute stop at [[Wal-Mart]].

In the early morning hours of [[September 11]], they boarded a commuter flight to Boston to connect to [[American Airlines Flight 11]], where al-Omari helped hijack the plane, and assisted [[Mohamed Atta al Sayed]] in crashing it into the World Trade Center part of an  attack that killed thousands of people.

==Aftermath== 
Controversy over al-Omari's identity erupted shortly after the attacks. At first, the FBI had named Abdul Rahman al-Omari, a pilot for Saudi Arabian Airlines, as the pilot of Flight 11. It was quickly shown that this person was still alive, and the FBI issued an apology. It was also  quickly determined that Mohamed Atta was the pilot among the hijackers. The FBI then named Abdulaziz al-Omari as a hijacker.

A man with the same name as those given by the [[FBI]] turned up alive in [[Saudi Arabia]], saying that he had studied at the [[University of Denver]] and his [[passport]] was stolen there in [[1995]]. The name, origin, birth date, and occupation were released by the FBI, but the picture was not of him. &quot;I couldn't believe it when the FBI put me on their list&quot;, he said. &quot;They gave my name and my date of birth, but I am not a suicide bomber. I am here. I am alive. I have no idea how to fly a plane. I had nothing to do with this.&quot; [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F2071FF63D5F0C758DDDA00894D9404482][http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=94438][http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1559151.stm] This individual was not the same person as the hijacker whose identity was later confirmed by Saudi government interviews with his family, according to the [[9/11 Commission]] Report.

      <comment>/* Archbishop of Canterbury */ broke up long sentence</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Saint Anselm of Canterbury''' ([[1033]] or [[1034]] &amp;ndash; [[April 21]] [[1109]]), a widely influential medieval [[philosopher]] and [[theology|theologian]], held the office of [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] from [[1093]] to [[1109]]. Called the founder of [[Scholasticism]], he is famous as the inventor of the [[ontological argument]] for the existence of [[God]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Anselm was born in the city of [[Aosta]] in the Kingdom of [[Burgundy]]. Aosta is located in the Italian [[Alps]] region of [[Valle d'Aosta]] (Aosta Valley), near the borders with twentieth century [[France]] and [[Switzerland]]. His family was accounted noble, and owned considerable property. Gundulph, his father, was by birth a [[Lombard]], and seems to have been a man of harsh and violent temper. His mother, Ermenberga, was a prudent and virtuous woman, who gave the young Anselm careful religious training. At the age of fifteen he desired to enter a convent, but he could not obtain his father's consent.  Disappointment brought on an apparent [[psychosomatic illness]], and after he recovered he seems to have given up his studies for a time and lived a more carefree life. During this period his mother died, and his father's harshness became unbearable.  In [[1059]] he left home, crossed the Alps, and wandered through [[Burgundy]] and [[France]]. Attracted by the fame of his countryman [[Lanfranc]], then [[prior]] of the [[Benedictine]] [[Abbey of Bec]], Anselm entered [[Normandy]]. The following year, after spending some time at [[Avranches]], he entered the [[abbey]] as a [[novice]] at the age of twenty-seven.

===His years at Bec===
Three years later, in [[1063]], when Lanfranc was made the abbot of [[Caen]], Anselm was elected [[prior]]. This office he held for fifteen years, and then, in [[1078]], on the death of the warrior monk [[Herluin]], founder and first abbot of [[Abbey of Bec|Bec]], Anselm was elected abbot. Under his jurisdiction, Bec became the first seat of learning in Europe, although Anselm appears to have been less interested in attracting external students to it. It was during these quiet years at Bec that Anselm wrote his first philosophical works, the ''Monologion'' and ''Proslogion.'' These were followed by ''The Dialogues on Truth'', ''Free Will'', and the ''Fall of the Devil''. 

Meanwhile the convent had been growing in wealth and reputation, and had acquired considerable property in [[England]]. It became the duty of Anselm to visit this property occasionally.  By his mildness of temper and unswerving rectitude, he so endeared himself to the English that he was looked upon as the natural successor to [[Lanfranc]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].  But on the death of that great man, [[William II of England|King William II]] seized the possessions and revenues of the see, and made no new appointment.  

About four years later, in [[1092]], on the invitation of [[Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh, Earl of Chester]], Anselm crossed to England. He was detained by business for nearly four months, and when about to return, was refused permission by the king. In the following year William fell ill, and feared his death was at hand. Eager to make atonement for his sin with regard to the archbishopric, he nominated Anselm to the vacant see, and after a great struggle compelled him to accept the pastoral staff of office.  After obtaining dispensation from his duties in Normandy, Anselm was consecrated in [[1093]].

===Archbishop of Canterbury===
As the conditions of his retaining office, Anselm demanded of the king that the he should give up all the possessions of the see, accept Anselm's spiritual counsel, and acknowledge Urban as pope in opposition to the anti-pope, Clement. He only obtained a partial consent to the first of these demands, and the last involved him in a serious difficulty with the king. It was a rule of the church that the consecration of metropolitans could not be completed without their receiving the [[pallium]] from the hands of the pope. Anselm, accordingly, insisted that he must proceed to [[Rome]] to receive the pall. But William would not permit this; he had not acknowledged Urban, and he maintained his right to prevent any pope being acknowledged by an English subject without his permission.  A great council of churchmen and nobles was held to settle the matter, and it advised Anselm to submit to the king. This advice failed to overcome Anselm's mild and patient firmness, and the matter was postponed. William meanwhile privately sent messengers to Rome, who acknowledged Urban and prevailed on him to send a legate to the king bearing the archiepiscopal pall. A partial reconciliation was then effected, and the matter of the pall was compromised. It was not given by the king, but was laid on the altar at Canterbury, whence Anselm took it.   

Little more than a year after, fresh trouble arose with the king, and Anselm resolved to proceed to Rome and seek the counsel of his spiritual father. With great difficulty he obtained the king's permission to leave, and in October [[1097]] he set out for Rome. William immediately seized the revenues of the see, and retained them to his death. Anselm was received with high honor by Urban at the [[Siege of Capua]], where Anselm is said to have garnered high praise also from the [[Saracen]] troops of Count [[Roger I of Sicily]]. At a great council held at Bari, Anselm was put forward to defend the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Ghost against the representatives of the Greek Church.  But Urban was too politic to embroil himself with the king of England, and Anselm found that he could obtain no substantial result. He withdrew from Rome, and spent some time at the little village of Schiavi, where he finished his treatise on the atonement, ''Cur Deus homo'', and then retired to Lyons.  When he attempted to return to England, William would not allow him entrance.

===Conflicts with King Henry I===
William was killed in [[1100]] and his successor, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], at once invited Anselm to return to England. But Henry demanded that Anselm should again receive from him in person investiture in his office of archbishop. The papal rule in this matter was plain: all homage and lay investiture were strictly prohibited. Anselm represented this to the king; but Henry would not relinquish a privilege possessed by his predecessors, and proposed that the matter should be laid before the Holy See. The answer of the pope reaffirmed the papal rule as to investiture. A second embassy was sent, with a similar result. Henry, however, remained firm, and at last, in [[1103]], Anselm and an envoy from the king set out for Rome. The pope, [[Pope Paschal II|Paschal II]], reaffirmed strongly the rule of investiture, and passed sentence of excommunication against all who had infringed the law, excepting King Henry. 

This left matters essentially as they were, and Anselm, who had received a message forbidding him to return to England unless on the king's terms, withdrew to Lyons, where he waited to see if Paschal would not take stronger measures.  At last, in [[1105]], he resolved himself to excommunicate Henry. His intention was made known to the king through his sister, and it seriously alarmed him, for it was a critical period in his affairs. A meeting was arranged, and a reconciliation between them effected. In [[1106]] Anselm crossed to England, with power from the pope to remove the sentence of excommunication from the illegally invested churchmen. In [[1107]] the long dispute as to investiture was finally ended by the king resigning his formal rights, and Anselm was allowed to return to England. The remaining two years of his life were spent in the duties of his archbishopric. He died on [[April 21]] [[1109]].  He was [[canonized]] in [[1494]] by [[Alexander VI]].

===&quot;Dilecto dilectori&quot;===

Many of Anselm's letters contained passionate expressions of attachment and affection, and were typically addressed ''dilecto dilectori'', sometimes translated as &quot;beloved lover&quot;. These letters were written to monks, male relatives, and others. This has led to some debate among academics about Anselm’s sexuality. There is wide agreement that Anselm was personally committed to the monastic ideal of celibacy, but some (Brian P. McGuire, [[John Boswell]], others) have characterized his passionate writings as expressions of a homosexual orientation. Others ([[Richard Southern]], Glenn Olsen, others) describe them as representing a &quot;wholly spiritual&quot; affection, &quot;nourished by an incorporeal ideal.&quot; (Southern).

==Writings==

Anselm may, with some justice, be considered the first scholarly philosopher of Christian [[theology]]. His only great predecessor, [[Scotus Erigena]], had more of the speculative and mystical element than is consistent with a schoolman. In Anselm, by contrast, one finds the special characteristics of scholastic theological thought: a recognition of the relationship of reason to revealed truth, and an attempt to elaborate a rational system of faith.  

===Foundation===
Anselm's constant endeavor was to render the contents of the Christian consciousness clear to reason, and to develop the intelligible truths interwoven with the Christian belief. The necessary preliminary for this is the possession of the Christian consciousness. As Anselm wrote: ''&quot;Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam. Nam et hoc credo, quia, nisi credidero, non intelligam.&quot;'' (&quot;Nor do I seek to understand that I may believe, but I believe that I may understand.  For this too I believe, that unless I first believe, I shall not understand.&quot;)  But after the faith is held fast, the attempt must be made to demonstrate by reason the truth of what we believe. Indeed, it is wrong not to do so: ''&quot;Negligentiae mihi esse videtur, si, postquam confirmati sumus in fide, non studemus quod credimus, intelligere.&quot;'' (&quot;I hold it to be a failure in duty if after we have become steadfast in our faith we do not strive to understand what we believe.&quot;) 

The groundwork of Anselm's theory of knowledge is contained in the tract ''De Veritate'', in which, from the consideration of truth as in knowledge, in willing, and in things, he rises to the affirmation of an absolute truth, in which all other truth participates.  This absolute truth is God himself, who is therefore the ultimate ground or principle both of things and of thought. The notion of God comes thus into the foreground of the system; before all things it is necessary that it should be made clear to reason, that it should be demonstrated to have real existence. 

===Proofs===
This demonstration is the substance of his works ''Monologion'' and ''Proslogion''.  In the first of these the proof rests on the ordinary grounds of realism, and coincides to some extent with the earlier theory of [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], though it is carried out with singular boldness and fulness. Things, he says, are called good in a variety of ways and degrees; this would be impossible if there were not some absolute standard, some good in itself, in which all relative goods participate. Similarly with such predicates as great, just; they involve a certain greatness and justice. The very existence of things is impossible without some one Being, by whom they come to exist. This absolute Being, this goodness, justice, greatness, is God. 

Anselm was not thoroughly satisfied with this reasoning; it started from ''a posteriori grounds'', and contained several converging lines of proof. He desired to have some one short demonstration. Such a demonstration he presented in his ''Proslogion''; this is his celebrated [[ontological argument|ontological proof]] of the existence of God. God is that being than whom none greater can be conceived. Now, if that than which nothing greater can be conceived existed only in the intellect, it would not be the absolutely greatest, for we could add to it existence in reality.  It follows, then, that the being than whom nothing greater can be conceived, ''i.e.'' God, necessarily has real existence. 

This reasoning, in which Anselm partially anticipated the Cartesian philosophers, has rarely seemed satisfactory. It was opposed at the time by the monk [[Gaunilo]], in his ''Liber pro Insipiente'', on the ground that we cannot pass from idea to reality. The same criticism is made by several of the later schoolmen, among others by [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]], and is in substance what [[Kant]] advances against all ontological proof. Anselm replied to the objections of Gaunilo in his ''Liber Apologeticus''. 

More recently, [[Haight and haight|Haight and Haight]] offered a response to Anselm's proof for the existence of God.

Anselm also authored a number of other arguments for the existence of God, based on [[cosmology|cosmological]] and [[teleology|teleological]] grounds.

===Further works===
The existence of God being thus held proved, Anselm proceeded to state the rational grounds of the Christian doctrines of creation and of the Trinity. With reference to the Trinity, he says we cannot know God from himself, but only after the analogy of his creatures. The special analogy used is the self-consciousness of man. The peculiar double nature of consciousness, memory and intelligence, represent the relation of the Father to the Son. The mutual love of these two, proceeding from the relation they hold to one another, symbolizes the Holy Spirit. The further theological doctrines of man, such as original sin and free will, are developed in the ''Monologion'' and other mixed treatises. 

Finally, in Anselm's greatest work, ''Cur Deus Homo'' (&quot;Why did God become Man?&quot;), he undertook to make plain, even to infidels, the rational necessity of the Christian mystery of the [[atonement]]. The theory rests on three positions: that satisfaction is necessary on account of God's honor and justice; that such satisfaction can be given only by the peculiar personality of the God-man Jesus; that such satisfaction is really given by the voluntary death of this infinitely valuable person. The demonstration is, in brief, this. All the actions of men are due to the furtherance of God's glory; if, then, there be sin, ''i.e.'' if God's honour be wounded, man of himself can give no satisfaction. But the justice of God demands satisfaction; and as an insult to infinite honour is in itself infinite, the satisfaction must be infinite, ''i.e.'' it must outweigh all that is not God. Such a penalty can only be paid by God himself, and, as a penalty for man, must be paid under the form of man. Satisfaction is only possible through the God-man. Now this God-man, as sinless, is exempt from the punishment of sin; His passion is therefore voluntary, not given as due. The merit of it is therefore infinite; God's justice is thus appeased, and His mercy may extend to man.  This theory has exercised immense influence on church doctrine, providing the basis for the [[Roman Catholic]] concept of the [[treasury of merit]]. It is certainly an advance on the older patristic theory, in so far as it substitutes for a contest between God and Satan, a contest between the goodness and justice of God. However, it can be said that Anselm puts the whole issue on a merely legal footing, giving it no ethical bearing, and neglects altogether the consciousness of the individual to be redeemed. In this respect it contrasts unfavorably with the later theory of [[Peter Abélard]]. 

===Recognition===
In the middle ages, Anselm's writings did not receive the respect and attention they deserved. This was probably due to their unsystematic character, for they are generally tracts or dialogues on detached questions, not elaborate treatises like the great works of  [[Aquinas]], [[Albert of Aix]], and [[Scotus Erigena|Erigena]]. They have, however, a freshness and philosophical vigor which more than makes up for their want of system, and which raises them far above the level of most scholastic writings.

The anniversary of his death on [[21 April]] is celebrated in the [[Catholic Church]] as Anselm's memorial day.  Anselm was proclaimed as a [[Doctor of the Church]] in [[1720]] by [[Pope Clement XI]].  Eight hundred years after his death, on [[21 April]] [[1909]], [[Pope Pius X]] issued an encyclical ''Communion Rerum'' praising Anselm and his ecclestical career and his writings.

The '''African Hunting Dog''' (''Lycaon pictus''), also called '''African Wild Dog''', is a mammal of the [[Canidae]] family, and thus related to the domestic [[dog]]. It is the only [[species]] in its [[genus]], '''''Lycaon'''''. They are, as their name indicates, found only in [[Africa]], especially in scrub [[savanna]] and other lightly wooded areas. The Latin name of the species means ''painted wolf'' and it is characteristic of the species that no two individuals have the same pattern of coat.

[[Image:Lightmatter African painted dog.jpg|thumb|left|An African Hunting Dog gnawing on a bone]]
African Hunting Dogs hunt in packs. Their main prey are [[impala]] and similar medium sized [[ungulate]]s. They're known for their stamina and for being clever hunters -- they have been observed hunting prey in relays, or even blocking a potential escape route for prey. Their voice is characterized by an unusual chirping or squeaking sound, similar to a bird. Their need for a large territory has led to the situation where today they are threatened with extinction. Their relatively small physique also makes them vulnerable to attacks by their competitors, [[lion]]s and [[hyena]]s. They tend to be elusive and unlike most other members of the [[Canidae|dog family]], are extremely difficult to tame.

They have a highly complex social system, within which related adult members cooperate to produce a single litter of pups annually. Most populations have more males than females because more male pups appear in litters; it is very unusual among mammals to have this kind of gender bias.  Wild dogs will often regurgitate meat to other members of the group: older dogs, the young, and adults that have stayed behind to guard the young during hunting sojourns.

The current estimate for remaining wild dogs in the wild is approximately 5,600. Of these, the majority live in the two remaining large populations associated with the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania and the population centered in northern Botswana and eastern Namibia. Isolated populations persist in Zambia, Kenya, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa.

'''Aage Niels Bohr''' (born in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] on [[June 19]], [[1922]]) is the son of Margrethe and [[Niels Bohr]]. Growing up among [[physicists]] like [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]], he became a notable [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] in his own right, being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in [[1975]]. In 1946 he became an associate at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] of [[Theoretical Physics]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. He served as the director of the institute from [[1963]] to [[1970]]. 

In [[1948]] Bohr worked with [[Ben Roy Mottelson|Ben Mottelson]] and [[James Rainwater|Leo James Rainwater]] in [[Copenhagen]] to summarize the current knowledge of nuclear structure in a [[monograph]]. The first volume, Single-Particle Motion, appeared in [[1969]], and the second volume, Nuclear Deformations, in [[1975]]. Their efforts on this project and their collaboration on nuclear theory led all three of them to receive the [[1975]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], for research on the quantum mechanical description of [[nucleons]] orbiting inside a wobbly rotating droplet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Analytic geometry''', also called '''coordinate geometry''' and earlier referred to as '''Cartesian geometry''', is the study of [[geometry]] using the principles of [[algebra]]. Usually the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is applied to manipulate [[equation]]s for planes, lines, curves, and circles, often in two and sometimes in three dimensions of measurement. As taught in school books, analytic geometry can be explained more simply: it is concerned with defining geometrical shapes in a numerical way, and extracting numerical information from that representation. The numerical output, however, might also be a [[Vector (spatial)|vector]] or a [[geometric shape|shape]]. Some consider that the introduction of analytic geometry was the beginning of modern [[mathematics]].

[[René Descartes]] is popularly regarded as having introduced the foundation for the methods of analytic geometry in [[1637]] in the appendix titled ''Geometry'' of the titled ''Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason in the Search for Truth in the Sciences'', commonly referred to as ''[[Discourse on Method]]''. This work, written in his native language ([[French language|French]]), and its philosophical principles, provided the foundation for [[calculus]] in Europe. 

==Important themes of analytical geometry==

* [[vector space]]
* definition of the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]
* [[distance]] problems
* the [[dot product]], to get the angle of two vectors
* the [[cross product]], to get a perpendicular vector of two known vectors (and also their spatial volume)
* [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] problems

Many of these problems involve [[linear algebra]]

== Example ==

Here is an example of a problem from the [[USAMTS]] that can be solved via analytic geometry:

'''Problem:''' In a convex pentagon &lt;math&gt;ABCDE&lt;/math&gt;, the sides have lengths &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;, though not necessarily in
that order. Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be the midpoints of the sides &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;CD&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;DE&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be the midpoint of segment &lt;math&gt;FH&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be the midpoint of segment &lt;math&gt;GI&lt;/math&gt;. The length of
segment &lt;math&gt;XY&lt;/math&gt; is an integer. Find all possible values for the length of side &lt;math&gt;AE&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Solution:''' Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be located at &lt;math&gt;A(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B(a,0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C(b,e)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D(c,f)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;E(d,g)&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the [[midpoint]] formula, the points &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are located at 

:&lt;math&gt;F\left(\frac{a}{2},0\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G\left(\frac{a+b}{2},\frac{e}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H\left(\frac{b+c}{2},\frac{e+f}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I\left(\frac{c+d}{2},\frac{f+g}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X\left(\frac{a+b+c}{4},\frac{e+f}{4}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Y\left(\frac{a+b+c+d}{4},\frac{e+f+g}{4}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[distance]] formula, 

:&lt;math&gt;AE=\sqrt{d^2+g^2}&lt;/math&gt; 

and 

:&lt;math&gt;XY=\sqrt{\frac{d^2}{16}+\frac{g^2}{16}}=\frac{\sqrt{d^2+g^2}}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;XY&lt;/math&gt; has to be an [[integer]], 
:&lt;math&gt;AE\equiv 0\pmod{4}&lt;/math&gt;
(see [[modular arithmetic]]) so &lt;math&gt;AE=4&lt;/math&gt;.

==Other uses==

'''Analytic geometry''', for [[algebraic geometry|algebraic geometers]], is also the name for the theory of (real or) [[complex manifold]]s and the more general '''analytic spaces''' defined locally by the vanishing of [[analytic function]]s of [[several complex variables]] (or sometimes real ones). It is closely linked to algebraic geometry, especially through the work of [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] in ''[[GAGA]]''. It is strictly a larger area than algebraic geometry, but studied by similar methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Arabic alphabet}}
{{alphabet}}
The '''Arabic alphabet''' is the [[writing system|script]] used for writing in the [[Arabic language]]. 

Because the [[Qur'an]], the holy book of [[Islam]], is written with this alphabet, its influence spread with that of Islam. As a result, the Arabic alphabet is used to write many other languages&amp;mdash;many other languages belonging to [[language family|language families]] other than [[Semitic language|Semitic]], the family Arabic belongs to, for example, the [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] languages. In order to accommodate the phonetics of other languages, the alphabet has been adapted by the addition of letters and other symbols. (See [[#Arabic alphabets of other languages|Arabic alphabets of other languages]] below).

The alphabet presents itself in different styles such as [[Nasta'līq]], [[Thuluth]], [[Kufic]] and others (see [[Arabic calligraphy]]), just like different [[script (styles of handwriting)|handwriting styles]] and [[typeface]]s for the [[Roman alphabet]]. Superficially, these styles appear quite different, but the basic letterforms remain the same.

==Structure of the Arabic alphabet==
The Arabic alphabet is written from right to left and is composed of 28 basic letters. Adaptations of the script for other languages such as [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] have additional letters. There is no difference between written and printed letters; the writing is [[unicase]] (i.e. the concept of [[Letter case|upper and lower case]] letters does not exist). On the other hand, most of the letters are attached to one another, even when printed, and their appearance changes as a function of whether they connect to preceding or following letters. Some combinations of letters form special [[ligature (typography)|ligature]]s.

The Arabic alphabet is an &quot;impure&quot; [[abjad]]&amp;mdash;[[vowel length|short vowels]] are not written, though long ones are&amp;mdash;so the reader must know the language in order to restore the vowels. However, in editions of the Qur'an or in didactic works a vocalization notation in the form of [[diacritic]] marks is used. Moreover, in vocalized texts, there is a series of other diacritics of which the most modern are an indication of vowel omission ''(sukūn)'' and the lengthening of consonants ''(šadda)''.

The names of Arabic letters can be thought of as abstractions of an older version where the names of the letters signified meaningful words in the [[Proto-Semitic]] language.

There are two orders for Arabic letters in the alphabet, the original Abjadī {{Arabiyyah|أبجدي}} order matches the ordering of letters in all alphabets derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], including the English ABC. The standard order used today, and shown in the table, is the Hejā'ī {{Arabiyyah|هجائي}} order, where letters are grouped according to their shape.

===Abjadi order===
{{main|abjadi order}}
The special Abjadī order (or two slightly variant orders) was devised by matching an Arabic letter of the fully consonant-dotted 28-letter Arabic alphabet to each of the 22 letters of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] (in their old [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] alphabetic order) — leaving six remaining Arabic letters at the end. 

The most common Abjad sequence is:

The following table provides all of the [[Unicode]] characters for Arabic, and none of the supplementary letters used for other languages. The transliteration given is the widespread [[DIN 31635]] standard, with some common alternatives. See the article ''[[Arabic transliteration]]'' for details and various other transliteration schemes.

Regarding pronunciation, the phonetic values given are those of the &quot;standard&quot; pronunciation of the ''[[Fusha (language)|fusha]]'' language as taught in universities. Actual pronunciation between the [[varieties of Arabic]] may vary widely. For more details concerning the pronunciation of Arabic, consult the article ''[[Arabic phonology]]''.

===Primary letters===
The Arabic script is cursive, and all primary letters have conditional forms for their glyphs, depending on whever they are at the begining, middle or end of a word, so they may exhibit 4 distinct forms (initial, medial, final or isolated). Six letters however only have isolated or final form, and if they followed by another letter, they do not join with it, and so this next letter can only have their initial or isolated form despite is is not an initial.

For compatibility with previous standards, Unicode encoded all these forms separately, however these forms can be infered from their joining context, using the same encoding. The table below shows this common encoding, in addition to the compatibility encodings for their normally contextual forms (Arabic texts should be encoded today using only the common encoding, but the rendering must then infer the joining types to determine the correct glyph forms, with or without ligation).

Letters lacking an initial or medial version are never tied to the following letter, even within a word. As to '''{{Ar|ﺀ}}''' ''hamza'', it has only a single graphic, since it is never tied to a preceding or following letter.  However, it is sometimes 'seated' on a waw, ya or alif, and in that case the seat behaves like an ordinary waw, ya or alif.

====Modified letters====
The following are not actual letters, but rather different orthographical shapes for letters.

;Notes:
The {{ArabDIN|ʼalif maqṣūra}}, commonly using Unicode 0x0649 ({{Ar|ى}}) in Arabic, is sometimes replaced in [[Persian language|Persian]] or Urdu, with Unicode 0x06CC (ی), called &quot;Farsi Yeh&quot;.  This is appropriate to its pronunciation in those languages.  The glyphs are identical in isolated and final form (ﻯ ﻰ), but not in initial and medial form, in which the Farsi Yeh gains two dots below (ﻳ ﻴ) while the {{ArabDIN|ʼalif maqṣūra}} has neither an initial nor a medial form.

====Ligatures====
The only compulsory ligature is ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'' + ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}''. All other ligatures (''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}''+''{{ArabDIN|mīm}}'', etc.) are optional.
* (isolated) ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'' + ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' (''{{ArabDIN|lā}}'' {{IPA|[læː]}}) :
*: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Ar|&amp;#xFEFB;}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
* (final) ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'' + ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' (''{{ArabDIN|lā}}'' {{IPA|[læː]}}) :
*: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Ar|&amp;#xFEFC;}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

[[Unicode]] has a special glyph for the ligature ''{{ArabDIN|llāh}}'', the post-vocalic form of ''{{ArabDIN|[[Allāh]]}}'' (“God”).
* U+FDF2 ARABIC LIGATURE ALLAH ISOLATED FORM:
*: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Ar|&amp;#xFDF2;}} (image: [[Image:Allah_glyph.png|28px]])&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Combined with an initial ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'', this becomes full ''{{ArabDIN|allāh}}'' :
*: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Ar|&amp;#x0627;&amp;#xFDF2;}}&lt;/div&gt;

The latter is a work-around for the shortcomings of most text processors, which are incapable of displaying the correct [[harakat|vowel marks]] for the word ''{{ArabDIN|[[Allāh]]}}'', because it should compose a small ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' sign above a gemination ''{{ArabDIN|šadda}}'' sign). Compare the display of the composed equivalents below (the exact outcome will depend on your browser and font configuration):
* ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'', (geminated) ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'' (with implied short-a vowel), (vowel reversed) ''{{ArabDIN|hāʼ}}'' :
*: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Ar|&amp;#x0644;&amp;#x0644;&amp;#x0647;}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
* ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'', ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'', (geminated) ''{{ArabDIN|lām}}'' (with implied short-a vowel), (vowel reversed) ''{{ArabDIN|hāʼ}}'' :
*: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Ar|&amp;#x0627;&amp;#x0644;&amp;#x0644;&amp;#x0647;}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

=== Hamza ===
{{main|hamza}}
Initially, the letter ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' indicated an occlusive glottal, or glottal stop, transcribed by {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, confirming the alphabet came from the same [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] origin. Now it is used in the same manner as in other [[abjad]]s, with ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}'' and ''{{ArabDIN|wāw}}'', as a ''mater lectionis'', that is to say, a consonant standing in for a long vowel (see below). In fact, over the course of time its original consonantal value has been obscured, since ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' now serves either as a long vowel or as graphic support for certain diacritics (madda or hamza).*****

The Arabic alphabet now uses the ''[[hamza]]'' to indicate a [[glottal stop]], which can appear anywhere in a word.  This letter, however, does not function like the others: it can be written alone or on a support in which case it becomes a diacritic:

* alone: {{Ar|ء}} ; 
* with a support: {{Ar|إ, أ}} (above and under a ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}''), {{Ar|ؤ}} (above a ''{{ArabDIN|wāw}}''), {{Ar|ئ}} (above a dotless ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}''  or ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ hamza}}'').

=== Diacritics ===

====Shadda====
{{main|shadda}}
''{{ArabDIN|šadda}}'' ( {{Ar|&amp;#x0651;}}&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small style=&quot;color:#CCCCCC&quot;&gt;&amp;#x25CC;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ) marks the [[gemination]] (doubling) of a consonant; an {{ArabDIN|kasra}} ( {{Ar|&amp;#x0650;}}&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small style=&quot;color:#CCCCCC&quot;&gt;&amp;#x25CC;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ) vowel sign (when present) moves to between the geminate (doubled) consonant and ''{{ArabDIN|šadda}}''.

The w-shaped ''{{ArabDIN|šadda}}'' glyph above the second consonnant that it geminates, is in fact the begining of a small ''{{ArabDIN|šīn}}'' letter.

====''Sukūn'' and ''ʼalif'' above====
An Arabic syllable can be open (ended by a vowel) or closed (ended by a consonant).
* open: CV[consonant-vowel] (long or short vowel)
* closed: CVC (short vowel only)

When the syllable is closed, we can indicate that the consonant that closes it does not carry a vowel by marking it with a sign called ''{{ArabDIN|sukūn}}'' ({{ar|ْ}}) to remove any ambiguity, especially when the text is not vocalised: it's necessary to remember that a standard text is only composed of series of consonants; thus, the word ''{{ArabDIN|qalb}}'', &quot;heart&quot;, is written ''{{ArabDIN|qlb}}''.

''{{ArabDIN|Sukūn}}'' allows us to know where not to place a vowel: ''{{ArabDIN|qlb}}'' could, in effect, be read ''/qVlVbV/'', but written with a ''sukūn'' over the ''{{ArabDIN|l}}'' and the ''{{ArabDIN|b}}'', it can only be interpreted as the form ''/qVlb/''; we write this {{Ar|قلْبْ}}. This is one stage from full vocalization, where the ''a'' vowel would also be indicated by a {{ArabDIN|fatḥa}}: {{Ar|قَلْبْ}}, 

The ''{{ArabDIN|[[Qur’an]]}}'' is traditionaly written in full vocalization. Outside of the ''{{ArabDIN|[[Qur’an]]}}'', putting a ''{{ArabDIN|sukūn}}'' above a ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}'' which indicates {{IPA|[i:]}}, or above a ''{{ArabDIN|wāw}}'' which stands for {{IPA|[u:]}} is extremely rare, to the point that ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}'' with sukūn will be unambiguously read as the diphthong {{IPA|[ai]}}, and ''{{ArabDIN|wāw}}'' with ''{{ArabDIN|sukūn}}'' will be read {{IPA|[au]}}.

The letters ''{{ArabDIN|m-w-s-y-q-ā}}'' ({{Ar|موسيقى}} with an ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif maqṣūra}}'' at the end of the word)
will be read most naturally as the word ''{{ArabDIN|mūsīqā}}'' (“music”).  If you were to write ''{{ArabDIN|sukūns}}'' above the ''{{ArabDIN|wāw}}'', ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}'' and ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'', you’d get {{Ar|وْسيْقىْ}}, which would be read as  ''{{ArabDIN|*mawsaykāy}}'' (note however that the final ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif maqṣūra}}'' is an ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' and never takes ''{{ArabDIN|sukūn}}'').  The word, entirely vocalised, would be written {{Ar|مُوْسِيْقَى}} in the ''{{ArabDIN|[[Qur’an]]}}'' (if it happened to appear there!), or {{Ar|مُوسِيقَى}} elsewhere.  (The Quranic spelling would have no ''{{ArabDIN|sukūn}}'' sign above the final ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif maqṣūra}}'', but instead a miniature ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' above the preceding ''{{ArabDIN|qaf}}'' consonant, which is a valid [[Unicode]] character but most Arabic computer fonts cannot in fact display this miniature ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'' as of 2006.)

A ''{{ArabDIN|sukūn}}'' is not placed on word-final consonants, even if no vowel is pronounced, because fully vocalised texts are always written as if  the ''[[i`rab]]'' vowels were in fact pronounced.  For example, ''{{ArabDIN|ʼaḥmad zawǧ šarr}}'', meaning “Ahmed is a bad husband”, for the purposes of Arabic grammar and orthography, is treated as if it was still pronounced with full ''i`rab'', i.e. ''{{ArabDIN|ʼaḥmadu zawǧun šarrun}}'' with the complete [[desinence]]s.

====Vowels====
{{main|Harakat}}

Arabic short vowels are generally ''not'' written, except sometimes in sacred texts (such as the Qurʼan) and didactics, which are known as vocalised texts.  Occasionally short vowels are marked where the word would otherwise be ambiguous and cannot be resolved simply from context.

Short vowels may be written with [[diacritic|diacritics]] placed above or below the consonant that precedes them in the syllable. (All Arabic vowels, long and short, follow a consonant; contrary to appearances: there ''is'' a consonant at the start of a name like Ali  in Arabic ''{{ArabDIN|ʻAliyy}}''  or a word like ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}''.)

Note that when the acute-shaped {{ArabDIN|fatḥa}} which denotes a short a is added on top of a geminated consonnant (i.e. after a {{ArabDIN|šadda}}), the fatha accent takes a vertical shape to make the composition more distinctable from the tanwiin vowel sign {{ArabDIN|fatḥatan}} (which marks a /-an/ ending with indeterminate nunation in fully vocalized texts, see below). For an example, see the encoded ligature for ''ʻAllah'' above.

Long &quot;a&quot; following a consonant other than hamzah is written with a short-&quot;a&quot; mark on the consonant plus an alif after it (''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}''). Long &quot;i&quot; is a mark for short &quot;i&quot; plus a yaa ''yāʼ'', and long u is mark for short u plus waaw, so aā = ā, iy = ī and uw = ū); long &quot;a&quot; following a hamzah sound may be represented by an alif-madda or by a floating hamzah followed by an alif.

In the table below, vowels will be placed above or below a dotted circle replacing a primary consonnant letter or shadda. Please note, that most consonnants (except 6 of them) do join to the left with ''{{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}'', ''{{ArabDIN|wāw}}'' and ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}'' written then with their medial or final form. Additionally, the ''{{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}'' letter in the last row may connect to the letter on its left, and then will use a medial or initial form. For clarity in the table below, the primary letter on the left used to mark these long vowels are shown only in their isolated form. Use the tableof primary letters to look at their actual glyph and joining types.

In an un-vocalised text (one in which the short vowels are not marked), the long vowels are represented by the consonnant in question : {{ArabDIN|ʼalif}}, {{ArabDIN|ʼalif maqṣūra}} (or {{ArabDIN|yeh}}), {{ArabDIN|wāw}}, {{ArabDIN|yāʼ}}. Long vowels written in the middle of a word of un-vocalized text are treated like consonants taking ''sukūn'' (see below) in a text that has full diacritics. Here also, the table shows long vowel letters only in isolated form for clarity.

==  Numerals  == 
{{main|Eastern Arabic numerals}}
There are two kinds of numerals used in Arabic writing; standard numerals and &quot;East Arab&quot; numerals, used in [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]] and [[India]].  In Arabic, these numbers are referred to as &quot;Indian numbers&quot; ({{Ar|أرقام هندية}} ''{{ArabDIN|arqām hindiyyah}}'').  In most of present-day North Africa, the usual Western numerals are used; in medieval times, a slightly different set (from which, via Italy, Western &quot;Arabic numerals&quot; derive) was used. Unlike Arabic alphabetic characters, Arabic numerals are written from left to right.

In addition, the Arabic alphabet can be used to represent numbers ([[Abjad numerals]]), a usage rare today. This usage is based on the [[#Abjadi order|Abjadi order]] of the alphabet. ''{{Semxlit|ʼalif}}'' is 1, {{Arabiyyah|ب}} ''{{Semxlit|bāʼ}}'' is 2, {{Arabiyyah|ج}} ''{{Semxlit|ǧīm}}'' is 3, and so on until {{Arabiyyah|ي}} ''{{Semxlit|yāʼ}}'' = 10, {{Arabiyyah|ك}} ''{{Semxlit|kāf}}'' = 20, {{Arabiyyah|ل}} ''{{Semxlit|lām}}'' = 30, ... {{Arabiyyah|ر}} ''{{Semxlit|rāʼ}}'' = 200, ..., {{Arabiyyah|غ}} ''{{Semxlit|ġayn}}'' = 1000.  This is sometimes used to produce [[chronogram]]s. *Standard form of number 2 in Egypt is slightly different

== History ==
{{main|History of the Arabic alphabet}}

The Arabic alphabet can be traced back to the [[Nabatean alphabet]] used to write the [[Nabataean]] dialect of [[Aramaic]], itself descended from Phoenician. The first known text in the Arabic alphabet is a late fourth-century inscription from [[Jabal Ram]] (50 km east of [[Aqaba]]), but the first dated one is a trilingual inscription at [[Zebed]] in [[Syria]] from 512.  However, the [[epigraph]]ic record is extremely sparse, with only five certainly [[pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions]] surviving, though some others may be pre-Islamic. Later, dots were added above and below the letters to differentiate them (the Aramaic model had fewer phonemes than the Arabic, and some originally distinct Aramaic letters had become indistinguishable in shape, so in the early writings 15 distinct letter-shapes had to do duty for 28 sounds!)  The first surviving document that definitely uses these dots is also the first surviving Arabic [[papyrus]] ([[PERF 558]]), dated April 643, although they did not become obligatory until much later. Important texts like the [[Qur'an|Qurʼan]] were frequently [[memorization|memorized]]; this practice, which survives even today, probably arose partially from a desire to avoid the great ambiguity of the script.

Yet later, vowel signs and [[hamza]]s were added, beginning sometime in the last half of the [[seventh century]], roughly contemporaneous with the first invention of Syriac and Hebrew [[vocalization]].  Initially, this was done by a system of red dots, said to have been commissioned by an [[Umayyad]] governor of [[Iraq]], [[Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]]: a dot above = ''{{Semxlit|a}}'', a dot below = ''{{Semxlit|i}}'', a dot on the line = ''{{Semxlit|u}}'', and doubled dots gave ''tanwin''.  However, this was cumbersome and easily confusable with the letter-distinguishing dots, so about 100 years later, the modern system was adopted.  The system was finalized around 786 by [[al-Farahidi]].

==Arabic alphabets of other languages==
Arabic script has been adopted for use in a wide variety of languages other than Arabic, including [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]].  Such adaptations may feature altered or new characters to represent [[phoneme]]s that do not appear in Arabic [[phonology]]. For example, the Arabic language lacks a {{IPA|[p]}} phoneme, so many languages add their own letter to represent {{IPA|[p]}} in the script, though the specific letter used varies from language to language.  These modifications tend to fall into groups: all the [[India]]n and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] languages written in Arabic script tend to use the [[Persian alphabet|Persian modified letters]]]); whereas [[West Africa]]n languages tend to imitate those of [[Ajami script|Ajami]], and [[Indonesia]]n ones those of [[Jawi]]. The modified version of the Arabic script originally devised for use with Persian is known as the '''[[Perso-Arabic script]]''' by scholars.

=== Current uses of the alphabet for other languages ===

The Arabic alphabet is currently used for:  

* [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] in Northern [[Iraq]].  (In [[Turkey]], the [[Latin alphabet]] is now used for Kurdish);
* [[Official language]] [[Persian language|Persian]] and regional languages including [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Sorani|Sorani-Kurdish]] and [[Baluchi]] in [[Iran]];
* Official languages [[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and regional languages including [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] in [[Afghanistan]];
* Official language [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and regional languages including [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] (where the script is known as [[Shahmukhi]]), [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], and [[Baluchi language|Baluchi]] in [[Pakistan]];
* [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] in [[India]] (see [[List of national languages of India]]);
* [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] (changed to Roman script in 1969 and back to a simplified, fully voweled, Arabic script in 1983), [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] by a minority of Kyrgyz in the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in northwest [[China]];
* [[Malay language|Malay]] in the Arabic script known as [[Jawi]] is co-official in [[Brunei]], and used for religious purposes in [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Singapore]];
* [[Comorian language|Comorian]] (Comorian) in the [[Comoros]], currently side by side with the [[Latin alphabet]] (neither is official);
* [[Hausa language|Hausa]] for many purposes, especially religious (known as ''[[Ajami script|Ajami]]'');
* [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]], widely but unofficially; (another alphabet used is [[N'Ko]])
* [[Wolof language|Wolof]] (at [[zaouia]]s), known as ''[[Wolofal]]''.
* [[Tamazight]] and other [[Berber languages]] were traditionally written in Arabic in the [[Maghreb]]. There is now a competing 'revival' of neo-[[Tifinagh]].

=== Former uses of the alphabet for other languages ===

In the past, Arabic script has also been used to represent some languages now written with a different script, such as the [[Latin alphabet]]. Most education was once religious instead of governmental and uniform within a state, so choice of script was determined by the user's religion and Muslims would use Arabic script to write any language they used. See also [[Languages of Muslim countries]].

* [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] (as it was first written among the &quot;[[Cape Malay]]s&quot;);
* [[Albanian language|Albanian]];
* [[Azeri language|Azeri]] in [[Azerbaijan]] (now written in the [[Latin alphabet]] and [[Cyrillic alphabet]] scripts in [[Azerbaijan]]);
* [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] (among ethnic [[Tatars]]);
* [[Berber languages|Berber]] in North Africa, particularly [[Tachelhit language|Tachelhit]] in [[Morocco]] (still being considered, along with [[Tifinagh]] and Latin for [[Tamazight]]);
* [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]] (for some years: from [[October Revolution]] (1917) until 1928);
* [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] (only for literary purposes); (presently written in the [[Latin alphabet]] and [[Cyrillic alphabet]] scripts)
* [[Chagatai language|Chaghatai]] across [[Central Asia]];
* [[Chechen language|Chechen]] (for some years: from [[October Revolution]] (1917) until 1928);
* [[Chinese languages|Chinese]] and [[Dungan language|Dungan]], among the Chinese [[Hui people|Hui]] [[Muslim]]s[http://www.aa.tufs.ac.jp/~kmach/xiaoerjin/xiaoerjin-e.htm];
* [[Fulani language|Fulani]], where the script is known as [[Ajami script]];
* [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] in [[Kazakhstan]];
* [[Kyrgyz]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]];
* [[Malay language|Malay]] in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]];
* [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]], when the Moors ruled Spain (and later [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] proper; see [[aljamiado]]);
* [[Nubian languages|Nubian]];
* [[Polish language|Polish]] (among ethnic [[Tatars]]);
* [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] has also been written in Arabic script, though it is more well known as using [[Devanagari]] - the script also known for being currently used for writing the [[Hindi language]].
* [[Swahili language|Swahili]];
* [[Somali language|Somali]] (has used the [[Latin alphabet]] since 1972);
* [[Songhay languages|Songhay]] in West Africa, particularly in [[Timbuktu]];
* [[Tatar language|Tatar]] ([[iske imlâ]]) before 1928 (changed to Latin), reformed in 1880's, 1918 (deletion of some letters);
* [[Turkish language|Turkish]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was written in Arabic script until [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] declared the change to [[Roman script]] in 1928. This form of Turkish is now known as [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and is held by many to be a different language, due to its much higher percentage of Persian and Arabic [[loanword]]s;
* [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] in [[Turkmenistan]];
* [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] in [[Uzbekistan]];
* All the Muslim peoples of the [[USSR]] between 1918-1928 (many also earlier), including [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]], [[Chechen language|Chechen]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]] etc.  After 1928 their script became Latin, then later Cyrillic.

== Computers and the Arabic alphabet ==

The Arabic alphabet can be encoded using several [[character set]]s, including [[ISO-8859-6]] and [[Unicode]], in the latter thanks to the &quot;Arabic segment&quot;, entries U+0600 to U+06FF. However, neither of these sets indicate the form each character should take in context. It is left to the [[rendering engine]] to select the proper [[glyph]] to display for each character.

When one wants to encode a particular written form of a character, there are extra code points provided in Unicode which can be used to express the exact written form desired. The ''Arabic presentation forms A'' (U+FB50 to U+FDFF) and ''Arabic presentation forms B'' (U+FE70 to U+FEFF) contain most of the characters with contextual variation as well as the extended characters appropriate for other languages. These effects are better achieved in Unicode  by using the ''zero width joiner'' and ''non-joiner'', as these presentation forms are deprecated in Unicode, and should generally only be used within the internals of text-rendering software, when using Unicode as an intermediate form for conversion between character encodings, or for backwards compatibility with implementations that rely on the hard-coding of glyph forms.

Finally, the Unicode encoding of Arabic is in ''logical order'', that is, the characters are entered, and stored in computer memory, in the order that they are written and pronounced without worrying about the direction in which they will be displayed on paper or on the screen. Again, it is left to the rendering engine to present the characters in the correct direction, using Unicode's [[bi-directional text]] features. In this regard, if the Arabic words on this page are written left to right, it is an indication that the Unicode rendering engine used to display them is out-of-date. For more information about encoding Arabic, consult the Unicode manual available at http://www.unicode.org/

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[angel|Angels]] have appeared in works of [[art]] for millennia.
Angel-shaped beings appear in ancient [[Mesopotamian]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] art and were probably the inspiration for the popular [[Christianity|Christian]] image of angels.

Angels remained a popular subject for [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[European]] paintings and sculpture.

Several famous examples are:

* ''The Ecstasy of [[Teresa of Avila|S. Teresa di Avila]]'' by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini]] (http://www.boglewood.com/cornaro/xteresa.html)

* ''The Annunciation'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (http://www.lairweb.org.nz/leonardo/annunciation.html)

Angels have also become an intregal part of [[Anime]] culture, particularly in [[fan art]] and [[web comics]]. 

==Contemporary works of art with angels:==

===Books===
*''[[Good Omens]]''
*''[[His dark materials]]''

===Anime and Manga===
*''[[Angel Sanctuary]]''
*''[[D.N.Angel|D.N. Angel]]''

The '''Arctic Fox''' (''Alopex lagopus'' or ''Vulpes lagopus'') is a small [[fox]] native to cold [[Arctic]] regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. It is common to see an arctic fox in all three tundra biomes. Although some authorities have suggested placing them in the [[genus]] ''[[Vulpes]]'', they have long been considered the sole member of the genus ''Alopex''. Smaller, more rounded ears than red fox; braincase more rounded and muzzle slightly shorter and broader than Vulpes vulpes (Clutton-Brock et al. 1976). Occurs in two distinct colour morphs, &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;white&quot;. Each colour phase also changes seasonally &quot;blue&quot; moults from chocolate brown in summer to lighter brown tinged with blue sheen in winter. In winter, &quot;white&quot; is almost pure white, while in summer it is grey to brownish-grey dorsally, and light grey to white below. Colour morphs are determined genetically at a single locus, white being recessive. The &quot;blue&quot; morph comprises less than 1% of the population through most of its continental range, but this proportion increases westwards in Alaska, and on islands. Head-and-body length: 55 cm (male); 53 cm (female). Tail length: 31 cm (male); 3O cm (female). Shoulder height: 25-30 cm. Weight: 3.8 kg (male); 3.1 kg (female)


==Habits==
[[Image:Arcticfox-3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Arctic Fox at Bird cliff]]
Arctic Foxes eat a wide variety of things, including [[lemming]]s, [[Arctic Hare]], [[bird]]s and their [[egg (biology)|egg]]s and [[carrions]]. The most important of these foods is lemming. A family of foxes can eat dozens of lemmings each day. During April and May, Arctic Foxes also prey on [[Ringed Seal]] pups when the young animals are confined to a snow den and are relatively helpless.Sometimes they follow polar bears and eat the left over prey.  When their normal prey is scarce, Arctic Foxes scavenge the leftovers of larger predators, such as [[Polar Bear]]s, even though Polar Bears' prey includes the Arctic Fox itself.    

The foxes tend to form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pairs in the breeding season. Litters of about half a dozen to a dozen [[whelp]]s are born in the early summer, a very large litter size for [[mammal]]s. The parents raise the young in a large [[den]].

Arctic foxes habitats are tundra and coastal areas. The white morph is generally associated with true tundra habitat, the blue more with coastal habitat.

==Population and distribution==
[[Image:Distribution arctic fox.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Distribution of the Arctic Fox]]
[[Image:Arctic fox.jpg|thumb|200px|left|An Arctic Fox]]
Arctic Foxes have a [[circumpolar]] range, meaning that they are found throughout the entire Arctic, including [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Nunavut]], [[Alaska]], [[Greenland]] and [[Svalbard]], as well as in sub-Arctic and alpine areas, such as [[Iceland]] and mainland alpine [[Scandinavia]]. The conservation status of the species is good, except for the Scandinavian mainland population. It is acutely endangered, despite decades of legal protection from hunting and persecution. The total population estimate in Norway, Sweden and Finland is a mere 120 adult individuals.

The abundance of Arctic Foxes tends to fluctuate in a cycle along with the population of lemmings. Because the foxes reproduce very quickly and often die young, population levels are not seriously impacted by [[trapping]]. They have, nonetheless, been eradicated from many areas where humans are settled.

The Arctic Fox is losing ground to the larger [[Red Fox]]. Historically, the [[Grey Wolf]] has kept the number of Red Foxes down, but as wolves have been hunted to near [[extinction]], the Red Fox population has grown larger, taking over the niche of top predator. In areas of northern [[Europe]] there are programs to hunt Red Foxes in the Arctic Fox's previous range.

The '''folklore of the United States''', or '''American folklore''', is the folk tradition which has evolved on the [[North America|North American]] continent since [[Europe|Europeans]] arrived in the [[16th century]]. While it contains much in the way of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tradition, it should not be confused with the actual tribal beliefs of any real band, nation or community of native people. American folklore, rather, is a fusion of European ideals of &quot;civilization&quot; with a European obsession with the &quot;exotic&quot; and the &quot;savage.&quot; American folklore is essentially about immigrants and their misunderstanding of each other, and of the new landscape they found themselves conquering, and of the people that had already been there when the first European colonists arrived. 

== Founding Myths ==
The founding of the [[United States]] is often translated as myth. A [[mythology]] is simply a story of some sort which has emotional, cultural, moral or ethical value to a nation.  Taken broadly, then, American mythology can include any narrative which has contributed to the shaping of [[American values]] and belief systems.  These narratives may be true and may be false; the veracity of the stories is not a determining factor. Three founding myths include: Christopher Columbus, the Pilgrims, and George Washington.

=== Christopher Columbus ===
Though [[Christopher Columbus]] did not participate in the founding of the American government, he has been interpreted as a &quot;founder&quot; of the American nation, in that it is descended from the [[Europe]]an immigrants that would not have moved to the New World if Columbus had not found where it was.  Indeed, one particularly pervasive myth is that Columbus discovered America, as it is far easier to heroify a man than a complex series of waves of immigrants from multiple conditions and walks of life.  According to some stories, Columbus sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in order to prove that the world was round, because he expected to reach the Far East by sailing west.  Like most mythological &quot;founders&quot; Columbus' mission is then rendered entirely noble, intellectual and rational.  He helped dispel the inaccurate myths of his time, and, so, it is concluded, the nation he founded must be a nation of intellect and logic.  [[Washington Irving]] is the first citation for this myth.

=== Pilgrims ===
The holiday of [[Thanksgiving]] is said to have begun with the [[Pilgrims]] in [[1619]].  They had come to America to escape religious persecution, but then nearly starved to death due to the unfamiliar land.  Some friendly [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s (including [[Squanto]]) helped the Pilgrims survive through the first winter.  The perseverance of the Pilgrims is celebrated during the annual Thanksgiving festival.  As a myth, this story relates to the founding of the culture.  The Pilgrims' dedication to their cause in spite of the hardships renders the foundation of the country, and therefore the country itself, seem stronger and more resilient.  It is also a fertility festival, similar in some ways to other harvest-time celebrations in other cultures, celebrating the nourishment that comes from the earth.  It was also said that the Pilgrims were the first colony in the New World, but before that, there were some [[France|French]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] colonies, as well as other [[England|English]] colonies.  Some English colonies in America that predated Plymouth Rock include [[Roanoke settlement]], which was later overtaken by or integrated with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, and the [[Jamestown Settlement]], which was successful and predated the Pilgrims' settlement by 20 years.

=== George Washington ===
[[George Washington]], the country's first president, is often said to be the founder of the United States.  Since his death, Washington has been mythologized, with many anecdotes and stories about his life told, in general, to present the founder of the modern American nation as a just and wise [[culture hero|cultural hero]].  For example, it is said that Washington, as a young child, chopped down his father's cherry tree.  His angry father confronted the young Washington, who proclaimed &quot;I can not tell a lie&quot; and admitted to the transgression, thus illuminating his honesty.  Parson [[Mason Locke Weems]] is the first citation of the myth, in his [[1850]] book, ''The Life of George Washington: With Curious Anecdotes, Equally Honorable to Himself and Exemplary to His Young Countrymen''.  [[Samuel Clemens]] (Mark Twain) is also known to have spread the story while lecturing, personalizing it by adding &quot;I have a higher and greater standard of principle. Washington could not lie. I can lie but I won't.&quot;  Stories of national mythological value often have similar themes - that the founder of the nation, [[Deucalion]], [[George Washington]], [[Abraham]] - was a wise, virtuous and brave man.
