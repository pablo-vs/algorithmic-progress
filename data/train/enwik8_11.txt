'''Ale''' is an ancient word for a [[fermentation|fermented]] [[alcoholic beverage]] obtained chiefly from [[malt|malted]] [[barley]]. 

Before the introduction of [[hop (plant)|hops]] into England from the [[Netherlands]] in the [[15th century]] the name &quot;ale&quot; was exclusively applied to unhopped fermented beverages, the term &quot;[[beer]]&quot; being gradually introduced to describe a brew with an infusion of hops. This distinction no longer applies.

A modern ale is commonly defined by the strain of yeast used and the fermenting temperature.

''Strain of Yeast'': An ale yeast is normally considered to be a [[top-fermenting]] yeast, though a number of British brewers, such as [[Fullers]] and [[Weltons]], use ale yeast strains that settle at the bottom. Common features of ale yeasts regardless of top or bottom fermentation is that they ferment more quickly than lager yeasts, they convert less of the [[sugar]] into [[alcohol]] (giving a sweeter, fuller body) and they produce more [[esters]] (which give a fruity taste) and [[diacetyl]] (which gives a buttery taste).

''Fermenting Temperature'': Ale is typically fermented at higher temperatures than lager beer (15–23°C, 60–75°F). Ale yeasts at these temperatures produce significant amounts of esters and other secondary flavor and aroma products, and the result is a beer with slightly &quot;fruity&quot; compounds resembling but not limited to apple, pear, pineapple, banana, plum or prune.

''Stylistic Difference to [[Lager]]'': Stylistic differences between some ales and lagers can be difficult to categorize. [[Steam beer]], [[Kölsch]] and some modern British Golden Summer Beers are seen as hybrids, using elements of both lager and ale production, while Baltic Porter and Bière de Garde may be produced by either lager or ale methods or a combination of both. However, lager is commonly perceived to be cleaner tasting, drier and lighter in the mouth than ale.

In a number of [[U.S. state]]s, especially in the [[western United States]], &quot;ale&quot; is the term mandated by state law for any beverage fermented from grain with an alcoholic strength above that which can legally be named &quot;beer,&quot; without regard to the method of fermentation or the yeast used. This distinction is not obsolete, but it is idiosyncratic.   

In former times the [[Wales|Welsh]] and [[Scotland|Scots]] had two distinct kinds of ale, called ''common'' and ''spiced'' ales, the relative values of which (compared to [[mead]]) were appraised by law in the following terms: 

:''If a farmer have no mead, he shall pay two casks of spiced ale, or four casks of common ale, for one cask of mead.''

Ales are very common in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Germany]], the [[United States]], and [[Belgium]]; however, [[Lager]] - but please see the discussion page about the term lager - is the dominant style of beer in almost all countries, worldwide.

==Varieties of ale==

===British / Irish / American ales===

British and Irish ales are, worldwide, the most popular variety of beer fermented with top-fermented yeast. Most beers in this region typically are made with yeast strains that leave some [[ester]]s behind, producing flavors often described as &quot;fruity&quot; or &quot;buttery&quot;. &quot;Earthy&quot; English hops are added, adding to the complexity. Within this region, a wide variety of substyles can be found, ranging from roasted malt ales (porter, stout), to highly hopped ales (India pale ale), to malt-balanced ales. Alcohol ranges from the very low (e.g. the English mild beer) to the very high (e.g. the English barley wine).

American style ales rose out of the microbrewery / craft brewing revolution that began in the early 1980s. Typically, these ales are very similar to their British counterparts, but have cleaner yeast strains, and often have higher hop rates dominated by American varieties (such as the citrusy Cascade hop.)

Any of these styles, when cask conditioned, can be termed [[cask ale]], and when unfiltered in the bottle can be termed [[bottle conditioned]]. [[CAMRA]] is a British organization that promotes [[real ale]].

*[[Amber ale|Amber/Red ale]]
*[[Barleywine]]
*[[Bitter (beer)|Bitter]]
**[[Pale ale]]
**[[India pale ale]] or Imperial pale ale or Strong pale ale
**[[Light ale]]
**[[Summer ale]]
*[[Blonde ale|Blonde/Golden ale]]
*[[Brown ale]]
*[[Cream ale]]
*[[Mild ale]] (or just &quot;mild&quot;)
*[[Old ale]]
*[[Irish red ale]]
*[[Scotch ale]]
*[[porter (beer)|Porter]]
**Robust Porter
**Brown Porter
*[[Stout]]
**[[Irish stout]] or Dry stout
**[[Imperial stout]]
**[[Milk stout]] or Sweet stout
**[[Oatmeal stout]]
**[[Chocolate stout]]
**[[Oyster stout]]
**[[Coffee stout]]

===Belgian ales===

[[Belgium]] produces a wide variety of specialty ales that elude easy classification. In addition to making a variety of [[blonde ale]], common classifications for these specialty beers may be [[dubbel]] (malty-complex with a red hue) and [[tripel]] (a high-alcohol, lightly-gold colored beer). 

Some specialty beers are based on monastic brewing recipes. The best known among them are the [[Trappist_beer|Trappist]] beers, which are brewed under direct control of the monks themselves. Only six Trappist monasteries in [[Belgium]] and one in the [[Netherlands]] brew this beer. Similar styled ales, brewed by commercial breweries (sometimes under licence of an actual monastery) are called [[Abbey beer]].

===German barley ales===

These are old-style ales fermented in Germany. A long, cold conditioning period yields a cleaner style, free of the esters that one finds in UK ales.

*[[Altbier]]
*[[Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch]]

===Wheat beer===

[[Wheat beer]] is found mostly in Germany, but examples can also be found in the United States and Belgium. German wheat beers are typically fermented with a yeast that yields [[esters]] with banana- and clovelike flavours. In contrast to most styles, these beers are typically served unfiltered (with the suspended yeast clouding the beverage, thus the German name 'heffe' for yeast). In American microbreweries, wheat beer is usually fermented with a clean yeast and filtered. Often this beer is combined with fruit flavors (e.g. raspberry wheat beers) to create a light, refreshing drink.

*Belgian witbier/bière blanche
*Weissbier, Hefeweizen and Dunkelweizen

===Specialty ales===
*[[Lambic]] &amp;mdash; a sour ale fermented by wild yeast, sometimes flavored with fruit.
*[[Berliner Weisse]] &amp;mdash; a low-strength sour wheat ale originating in [[Berlin]].
*[[Flanders ale]] ([[Saison]], [[Oud bruin|Oud Bruin]], [[Bière de Garde]]) &amp;mdash; a unique farmhouse style sour ale produced primarily in the [[Flanders]] region of Belgium and France.
*[[Rauchbier]] &amp;mdash; a style of beer made with smoked malt. While beers called Rauchbier may be ale, the classic examples are technically [[lager|lagers]].

The word '''amateur''' has at least two [[connotation]]s.  In the first, more widely used manner, it means someone performing some task without pay, in contrast to a &quot;[[professional]]&quot; who would be paid for the same task.  In this sense, labeling someone an &quot;amateur&quot; can have a negative connotation.  For example, amateur [[athlete]]s in sports such as [[basketball]] or [[Football games|football]] would not be regarded as having ability on par with professional athletes in those [[sport]]s.

Where this can be interesting is in the case of the [[Olympic Games]].  Most Olympic events required that the athletes be amateurs, or non-professionals.  To receive pay to perform the sport could have disqualified an athlete from an event, as in the case of [[Jim Thorpe]]. Such regulations are now nonexistent for all Olympic sports with the exception of [[boxing]].

Also in the areas of [[computer programming]] and [[open source]], as well as [[astronomy]] and [[ornithology]], many amateurs make very meaningful contributions equivalent to or exceeding those of the professionals.  To many, description as an amateur is losing its negative meaning, and actually carries a badge of honor. 

The other, perhaps somewhat obsolescent usage, stems from the French form of the [[Latin]] root of the word meaning a &quot;lover of&quot;. (''See [[amateurism]]''.) In this sense, retaining its French inflexion (&quot;am-a-tEUR&quot;), an amateur may be as competent as a paid professional, yet is motivated by a love or passion for the activity, like a ''[[connoisseur]]''. In the [[17th century|17th]] and [[18th century|18th]] centuries ''[[virtuoso]]'' had similar connotations of passionate involvement.

Indeed, another thriving example of such work is [[Amateur Dramatics]] - whether [[play]]s or [[musical theater]]. Often performed to high standards (but lacking the budgets of the professional [[West End theatre]]/[[Broadway theatre]]versions) and with an intense passion for the scene.

It has been suggested that the crude, all or nothing categories of professional or amateur should be reconsidered. A historical shift is occurring with the rise of [[Pro-Ams]], a new category of people that are pursuing amateur activities to professional standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce''' ([[June 24]], [[1842]]&amp;ndash;[[1914]]?) was an American [[satire|satirist]], [[critic]], [[poet]], [[short story]] [[writer]], [[editor]], and [[journalist]].[[Image:Ambrose_bierce.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Ambrose Bierce, date unknown.]]
His clear style and lack of sentimentality have kept him popular when many of his contemporaries have become obscure.  His dark, sardonic views  and vehemence as a critic, earned him the [[nickname]] &quot;Bitter Bierce&quot;.  Such was Bierce's venerable [[reputation]], that it was feared that his judgment on any contemporary fiction of the day could &quot;make or break&quot; a writer's career. 

==Early life and military career==
Born in a rural area of [[Meigs County]], [[Ohio]], Bierce resided during his adolescence in the town of [[Elkhart, Indiana|Elkhart]], [[Indiana]]. At the outset of the [[American Civil War]], Bierce enlisted in the Ninth Regiment, Indiana Volunteers, as part of the [[Union Army]]. In February [[1862]], he was commissioned as a first lieutenant and served on the staff of Gen. [[William Babcock Hazen]] as a topographical engineer, making maps of likely battlefields. He fought bravely in several of the war's most important battles, at one point receiving newspaper attention for his daring rescue under fire of a gravely wounded comrade at the battle of [[Girard Hill]], [[West Virginia]]. In June, [[1864]], he received a serious head wound at the [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain]] and spent the rest of the summer on furlough, but returned to active duty in September, and was ultimately discharged from the army in January [[1865]].

His military career, however, resumed when, in the summer of [[1866]], he rejoined Gen. Hazen as part of the latter's [[expedition]] to inspect military outposts across the Western [[plains]]. The expedition proceeded by horseback and wagon from [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], arriving in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] near the end of the year.

==Journalism==
In San Francisco, Bierce resigned from the Army and received the rank of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] Major. He remained there for many years, eventually becoming famous as a contributor and/or editor for a number of local newspapers and periodicals, including ''The San Francisco News Letter'', ''The Argonaut'', and ''The Wasp''. Bierce lived and wrote in [[England]] from [[1872]] to [[1875]].  Returning to the [[United States]], he again took up residence in San Francisco. In [[1879]]&amp;ndash;[[1880]], he went to [[Rockerville]] and [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], in the [[Dakota Territory]], to try his hand as local manager for a [[New York]] [[mining]] company, but when the company failed he returned to San Francisco and resumed his career in [[journalism]]. In [[1887]], he became one of the first regular columnists and editorialists to be employed on [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s newspaper, the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', eventually becoming one of the most prominent and influential among the writers and journalists of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. In December [[1899]], he moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], but continued his association with the [[Hearst newspapers]] until [[1906]].

===The McKinley accusation===
Because of his penchant for biting social criticism and satire, Bierce's long newspaper career was often steeped in controversy.  On several occasions his columns stirred up a storm of hostile reaction which created difficulties for Hearst.  One of the most notable of these incidents occurred following the [[assassination]] of President [[William McKinley]] when Hearst's political opponents turned a [[satire|satirical]] [[poetry|poem]] Bierce had written in [[1900]]  into a ''[[cause célèbre]]''.  Bierce meant his poem, written on the occasion of the assassination of Governor-elect [[William Goebel]] of [[Kentucky]], to express a national mood of dismay and fear, but after McKinley was shot in [[1901]] it seemed to foreshadow the crime:
  
:''The bullet that pierced Goebel's breast''
:''Can not be found in all the West;''
:''Good reason, it is speeding here''
:''To stretch McKinley on his bier.''

Hearst was (presumably) falsely accused by rival newspapers&amp;mdash;and by then [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Elihu Root]]&amp;mdash;of having called for McKinley's assassination.  Despite a national uproar that ended his ambitions for the presidency (and even his membership in the [[Bohemian Club]]), Hearst neither revealed Bierce as the author of the poem, nor fired him.

==Literary works==
His short stories are considered among the best of the [[19th century]].
He wrote realistically of the terrible things he had seen in the war in such stories as &quot;[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]&quot;, &quot;[[Killed at Resaca]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Chickamauga]]&quot;.

Bierce was reckoned a master of &quot;pure&quot; [[English language|English]] by his contemporaries, and virtually everything that came from his pen was notable for its judicious wording and economy of style.
He wrote skillfully in a variety of literary genres, and in addition to his celebrated ghost and war stories he published several volumes of [[poetry]] and [[verse]]. His ''Fantastic Fables'' anticipated the ironic style of grotesquerie that turned into a genre in the [[20th century]].

One of Bierce's most famous works is his much-quoted book, ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'', originally a newspaper serialization which was first published in book form in 1906 as ''The Cynic's Word Book.'' It offers an interesting reinterpretation of the English language in which [[cant]] and political double-talk are neatly lampooned. 

Bierce's twelve-volume ''Collected Works'' were published in [[1909]], the seventh volume of which consists solely of &quot;[[The Devil's Dictionary]],&quot; the title Bierce himself preferred to &quot;The Cynic's Word Book.&quot;

==Disappearance==
In October [[1913]], the [[Ageing#Dividing the lifespan|septuagenarian]] Bierce departed Washington on a tour to revisit his old [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battlefields. By December, he had proceeded on through [[Louisiana]] and [[Texas]], crossing by way of [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] into [[Mexico]], which was then in the throes of [[Mexican Revolution|revolution]]. In [[Ciudad Juárez]], he joined the army of [[Pancho Villa]] as an observer, in which role he participated in the battle of [[Tierra Blanca]]. He is known to have accompanied Villa's army as far as the city of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua]].  After a last letter to a close friend, sent from that city on [[December 26]], [[1913]], he vanished without a trace, becoming one of the most famous disappearances in American literary history. Subsequent investigations to ascertain his fate were fruitless and, despite many decades of speculation, his [[List of people who have disappeared|disappearance]] remains a mystery.

In one of his last letters, Bierce wrote:

:Good-by &amp;mdash; if you hear of my being stood up against a Mexican stone wall and shot to rags please know that I think that a pretty good way to depart this life. It beats old age, disease, or falling down the cellar stairs. To be a [[Gringo]] in Mexico &amp;mdash; ah, that is euthanasia

==Bierce in popular culture==
[[Robert W. Chambers]] borrowed several terms and fictional locations (including, for instance, [[Carcosa]] and [[Hastur]]) from Bierce, for use in his book of horror short stories, [[The King in Yellow]]. The horror writer [[H.P. Lovecraft]] later incorporated these into his own work, as did other authors who later extended Lovecraft's characters and themes, collectively creating the [[Cthulhu Mythos]].

[[Robert Bloch]]'s short story &quot;I Like Blondes&quot; (published in [[Playboy]], [[1956]]) is constructed around a group of alien bodysnatchers frequenting Earth. The narrator's host body's &quot;name was Beers...Ambrose Beers, I believe. He [[Ambrose Bierce#Disappearance|picked it up in Mexico a long time ago]].&quot;

At least three films have been made of Bierce's story ''An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge''. A silent movie version was made in the [[1920s]]. A French version called ''La Rivière du Hibou'', directed by Robert Enrico, was released in [[1962]] (available as of 2005). This is a black and white film, faithfully recounting the original narrative using voice-over. Another version, directed by Brian James Egan, was released in 2005. The story was also used for an episode of the [[television series]] ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'': ''[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (The Twilight Zone)|An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]''.  A copy of ''An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge'' appeared in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' (ep. &quot;[[Episodes_of_Lost_%28season_2%29#The_Long_Con|The Long Con]]&quot; - airdate [[February 8]], [[2006]]).

[[Mexico|Mexican]] [[novelist]] [[Carlos Fuentes]] wrote [[Old Gringo|''Gringo Viejo'']] (''The Old Gringo''), a fictionalized account of Bierce's disappearance. Fuentes's keenly observed novel was later adapted as a [[film|motion picture]], with [[Gregory Peck]] in the title role.

Bierce appears as a character in the [[2000]] movie ''From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter'' (set in [[1913]], a [[prequel]] to the original ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn]]''). While traveling to join up with Villa, Bierce is first attacked by bandits, and then trapped in a bar filled with vampires bent on killing all the humans inside. This clearly fictional adventure also portrayed Bierce as an alcoholic. In that movie Ambrose Bierce was played by [[Michael Parks]].

Bierce appears as a character in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novella ''[[Lost Legacy]]'', (published in the short story collection ''[[Assignment in Eternity]]'').  In the story, Bierce is one of a league of humans who have learned to use the unused portions of their brains and have advanced mental powers.

Bierce appears as the main character and narrator in the story ''The Oxoxoco Bottle'' by [[Gerald Kersh]]. The bulk of the story purports to be a manuscript written by Bierce on his last journey in Mexico, and relates a very strange adventure. The manner of his death, however, remains a mystery at the end.

Bierce is depicted as a detective in series of mystery novels by [[Oakley Hall]], including ''Ambrose Bierce and the Queen of Spades'' and ''Ambrose Bierce and the Death of Kings''.

In [[DC Comics]]'s miniseries ''[[Stanley and His Monster]]'', Bierce (or at least a character claiming to be Bierce) appears as a sardonic trenchcoat-clad adventurer into the supernatual, very similar to [[John Constantine]]; although Bierce derides Constantine as a &quot;clown,&quot; he admits that he and Constantine are but two of several trenchcoated occult adventurers at large in the world, perhaps an implication by the writer that the archetype of the sarcastic commentator on the occult, exemplified by Constantine, can be traced back to Bierce as narrator of his own horror stories.  When the comic book Bierce learns that the boy Stanley's friend, the nameless Monster, is a demon, he considers vanquishing him but soon realizes that the Monster is a benevolent demon and instead helps Stanley and his friend against other demons.

[[image:Alexis_Carrel.jpg|thumb|right|Alexis Carrel]]
'''Alexis Carrel''' ([[June 28]] [[1873]] &amp;ndash; [[November 5]] [[1944]]) was a French surgeon and biologist. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in [[1912]]. Born and educated in [[Lyon, France]]. He practiced in France and the United States (University of Chicago and the Rockefeller Institute). He developed new techniques in vascular sutures and was a pioneer in [[transplantology]] and [[thoracic surgery]]. He was a member of [[learned societies]] in the [[United States|United States of America]], [[Spain]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Vatican City]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]] and received honorary doctorates from the Universities of [[Belfast]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[California]], [[New York]], [[Brown University|Brown]] and [[Columbia University|Columbia]].

== Contributions to science ==

On January 17, [[1912]] he placed a part of chicken's embryo heart in fresh nutrient medium in a stoppered [[Pyrex]] flask of his design. Every forty-eight hours the tissue doubled in size and was transferred to a new flask. The tissue was still growing 20 years later, longer than life of the chicken itself.

Carrel was honored in 1912 with a [[Nobel prize]] in medicine in recognition of his work on vascular suture and the transplantation of blood vessels and organs. [http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1912/index.html]

During the [[First World War]], Carrel and the English chemist, [[Henry Drysdale Dakin]], developed the Carrel-Dakin method of treating wounds with sutures, which prior to the development of widespread [[antibiotics]], was responsible for saving many lives. For this, Carrel was awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]].
        
He co-authored a book with [[Charles A. Lindbergh]], ''The Culture of Organs'', and worked with Lindbergh in the mid-1930s to create the &quot;perfusion pump,&quot; which allowed living organs to exist outside of the body during surgery. The advance is said to have been a crucial step in the development of open-heart surgery and organ transplants, and to have laid the groundwork for the [[artificial heart]], which became a reality decades later. Some critics of Lindbergh claimed that Carrel overstated Lindbergh's role to gain media attention. (Wallace, ''American Axis'' p. 101). Both Lindbergh and Carrel appeared on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] on [[June 13]], [[1938]].

In 1972, the Swedish Post Office honored Carrel with a stamp that was part of its Nobel stamp series. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel/stamps/1972.html] In 1979, the [[lunar crater]] [[Carrel (crater)|Carrel]] was named after him as a tribute to his scientific breakthroughs.

== Relation to [[eugenics]] and [[fascism]] ==

In 1935, Carrel published a best-selling book titled ''L'Homme, cet inconnu '' (''Man The Unknown'') which advocated, in part, that mankind could better itself by following the guidance of an elite group intellectuals, and by implementing a regime of enforced [[eugenics]]. Roger Callois, writing in ''The Edge of Surrealism'', quotes and paraphrases ''L'Homme, cet inconnu '' as follows: &quot; '(p)resent-day proletarians owe their status to inherited intellectual and physical defects'  (sancta simplicitas). And he suggests that this state of affairs should be accenetuated through appropriate measures, so as to correlate social and biological inequalities more precisely.  Society would then be directed by a hereditary aristocracy composed of descendants from the Crusaders, the heroes of the Revolution, the great criminals, the financial and industrial magnates&quot; (p. 360).  

Carrel advocated the use of gas chambers to rid humanity of inferior stock.  His endorsement of this idea began in the mid-1930's, prior to Nazi implementation of such practices. In the 1936 German introduction of his book, at the publishers request, he added the following praise of the Nazi regime which did not appear in the editions in other languages: &quot;(t)he German government has taken energetic measures against the propagation of the defective, the mentally diseased, and the criminal. The ideal solution would be the suppression of each of these individuals as soon as he has proven himself to be dangerous.&quot; (quoted in Reggiani, p. 339).  He also wrote: &quot;(t)he conditioning of petty criminals with the whip, or some more scientific procedure, followed by a short stay in hospital, would probably suffice to insure order. Those who have murdered, robbed while armed with automatic pistol or machine gun, kidnapped children, despoiled the poor of their savings, misled the public in important matters, should be humanely and economically disposed of in small euthanasic institutions supplied with proper gasses. A similar treatment could be advantageously applied to the insane, guilty of criminal acts.&quot; (quoted in Szasz)

In 1937, Carrel joined [[Jean Coutrot]]’s Centre d’Etudes des Problèmes Humains.  (Coutrot’s aim was to develop what he called an ‘‘economic humanism’’ through &quot;collective thinking.&quot;)  In 1941, through connections to the [[Petain]] cabinet (specifically, French industrial physicians André Gros and Jacques Ménétrier) he went on to advocate for the creation of Fondation Française pour l’Etude des Problèmes Humains (French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems) which was created by decree of the collaborationist [[Vichy]] regime in 1941, and where he served as 'regent' (see Andrés Horacio Reggiani, ''Alexis Carrel, the Unknown: Eugenics and Population Research under Vichy'', as well as Callois, p. 107).  &quot;The foundation was chartered as a public institution under the joint supervision of the ministries of finance and public health. It was given financial autonomy and a budget of forty million francs—roughly one franc per inhabitant—a true luxury considering the burdens imposed by the German Occupation on the nation’s resources. By way of comparison, the whole Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) was given a budget of fifty million francs.&quot; (Reggiani)  [http://fhs.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/25/2/331] According to Par Gwen Terrenoire, writing in ''Eugenics in France (1913-1941) : a review of research findings'' (Joint Programmatic Commission UNESCO-ONG Science and Ethics, 2003) [http://ong-comite-liaison.unesco.org/ongpho/acti/3/2/document/8/pdfen.pdf] &quot;The foundation was a puridisciplinary centre that employed around 300 researchers (mainly statisticians, psychologists, physicians) from the summer of 1942 to the end of the autumn of 1944.  After the liberation of Paris, Carrel was suspended by the Minister of Health ; he died in November 1944, but the Foundation itself was &quot;purged&quot;, only to reappear in a short time as the Institut national d’études démographiques (INED) that is still active.&quot;  Scholars including Lucien Bonnafé, Patrick Tort and Max Lafont have accused Carrel of responsibility for the execution of thousands of mentally ill or impaired patients under Vichy.  They argue that this policy was inspired by Carrel's advocacy.  Other scholars state that Carrel merely provided intellectual cover for policies that would have been undertaken with or without his advocacy.  All this eventually led many in France to accuse him of collaboration with the Nazis.  

This association with Vichy, and the harshness of his advocacy for eugenics, has led to his descent from fame to obscurity.  In recent years, [[Jean-Marie le Pen]], the French neo-fascist politician, has become an advocate for Carrel, referring to him as &quot;the first environmentalist, or, if you will, the first modern ecologist, precisely because he committed himself to defining the relationships of natural harmony.&quot; (le Pen, L'Espoir 133-134, cited in Golson, Fascism's Return).  His writings on eugenics are studied &quot;avidly in the training camps of the [[National Front]]&quot;.  (Lucien Bonnafé and Patrick Tort, ''L'Homme, cet inconnu? Alexis Carrel, Jean-Marie le Pen et les chambres a gaz'' [http://www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/ASIN/2907993143/403-4807364-1466832])

In the 1990's, the attention the [[National Front]]'s support brought to Carrel's fascist associations and advocacy for forced euthenasia created a series of controversies with respect to streets and institutions named in honor of Carrel.  Over 20 French cities and towns, including Paris, renamed streets previously named for Carrel.  The controvery came to a head in Lyon, his birhtplace, where a medical school was named in his honor.  [[Lyon libération]] questioned the wisdom of this. In response to this, &quot;(i)n May 1995, the Palais des Congrès of Lyon hosted a conference on Carrel and scientific racism at which several of the participants accused the inquiry commission of whitewashing the controversial scientist. In early 1996, after five years of embarrassing publicity, the governing board of the University of Lyon decided to rename its school of medicine after [[René Laënnec]], inventor of the stethoscope.&quot;  [http://fhs.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/25/2/331]

In the United States as well as France, the 1990's were not kind to Carrel's reputation.  In an interview for PBS' The American Experience, historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. blamed Carrel for Charles Lindbergh's increasing racism in the 1930's.  Schlesinger states in response to a question concerning the source of Lindbergh's beliefs on this subject: &quot;I suppose he got a lot of it from Alexis Carrel, the French biologist who had a kind of racial mysticism of a sort.&quot; [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lindbergh/filmmore/reference/interview/schlesinger03.html]

== Alleged influence on the rise of Islamism ==

Carrel's eugenic ideas are alleged by some scholars to have had &quot;superficial commonalities&quot; with the thought of such early advocates of [[Islamism]] as [[Ali Shariati]] and Muslim Brotherhood propagandist [[Sayyed Qutb]]. Qutb, in fact, cites Carrel more than any other author.  (Qutb was one of the key philosophers in the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] movement after the death of its founder in 1949 and Qutb's brother was [[bin Laden]]'s intellectual mentor at [[King Abdul Aziz University]] in [[Jeddah]], along with [[Abdullah Azzam]]). (For more on the Carrel / Islamist connection, see Tariq Ali, ''Clash of Fundamentalisms'', p. 274; Youssef Choueiri, ''Islamic Fundamentalism'' (London 1990) and Rudolph Walther, ''Die seltsamen Lehren des Doktor Carrel'', DIE ZEIT 31.07.2003 Nr.32)  

Tariq Ali, Youssef Choueiri, Abu-Rabi, and Aziz Al-Azmeh, as well as other scholars of Islamism, see Carrel as a primary (if unwitting) influence on the origin of Islamism.  Quoting from Rudolf Walther's article in ''Die Zeit'': &quot;(t)he superficial commonalities between Carrel and Qutb are plain: we meet the medical man's elite in a &quot;scientific monastery&quot; as Qutb's &quot;avant garde,&quot; and the Carrel's &quot;biological classes&quot; are Qutb's &quot;belief classes.&quot; Whether &quot;civilization&quot; (Carrel) or &quot;barbarism&quot; (Qutb) -- neither are &quot;worthy of us,&quot; because they contradict &quot;our true nature&quot; (Carrel) or Qutb's &quot;good, healthy nature.&quot; Both are in agreement in their goal to reconcile knowledge and belief.

Qutb follows Carrel in making &quot;human nature&quot; the condition and measure of all thought and action. Because &quot;human nature&quot; is simultaneously posited as God-given, both immunize &quot;human nature&quot; against criticism, because God answers queries as little as &quot;nature&quot; does objections. The core of Qutb's supposed Middle Eastern Islamism is formed by a naturalistic logical error that is deeply rooted in European philosophy... Carrel writes: &quot;The goal of life is to follow the laws of life. We decipher these laws from our bodies and our souls, not from philosophical systems and concepts.&quot; Thus ethical norms (&quot;laws of life&quot;) are derived directly from biological facts and psychological diagnoses. Translated to Qutb's language, human freedom and thus a free, varied society are not possible, only obedience to the law of God. [...]

What Qutb calls &quot;the Islamic method,&quot; the integration of education, ethics, economics and politics to a unified system of &quot;divine uniqueness,&quot; matches Carrel's &quot;unification of all capabilities and their coordination to a single belief,&quot; the &quot;super-science&quot; in every detail ...&quot;

This influence is ironic, given that Carrel himself was a devoted Roman Catholic and Christian mystic. He mentions Islam in ''Man, the Unknown'' just once, and not in a complimentary manner. He notes of European Christian civilization, that, &quot;(a)t the cost of immense efforts, we succeeded in thrusting back the sleep of Islamism.&quot; Throughout his book, he refers to European civilization as &quot;Christendom.&quot;  Moreover, he believed in the racial superiority of northern Europeans.  These ideas would have been anathema to Qutb.

'''Robert Anthony Eden, 1st Earl of Avon''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] ([[June 12]], [[1897]]&amp;ndash; [[January 14]], [[1977]]), [[United Kingdom|British]] politician, was [[Foreign Secretary]] during [[World War II]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] during the 1950s. He is remembered mainly for his role in the disastrous [[Suez Crisis]] of [[1956]]. In a 2004 poll [http://www.mori.com/polls/2004/leeds.shtml] of 139 political science academics organised by [[MORI]], Eden was voted the least successful British Prime Minister of the 20th Century. This echoed the outcome of an earlier survey by BBC Radio's ''The Westminster Hour'', ranking the British Prime Ministers of the 20th Century. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/575219.stm[2]] Winston Churchill came top, Eden bottom.

==Early career==
Eden was born in [[Durham]], into a very conservative landowner family. His mother, Sybil Grey, was a member of the famous Grey family of [[Northumberland]] (see below). He studied at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he graduated in oriental languages. (He was fluent in French, German and Persian. He also spoke Russian and Arabic). Following a military career during the [[World War I|First World War]], during which he received a [[Military Cross]], Eden entered politics in [[1923]] when he was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Warwick and Leamington]], as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]. In that year also he married Beatrice Beckett. They had two sons, but the marriage was not a success and broke up under the strain of Eden's political career.

Eden became Parliamentary Private Secretary at the [[Foreign Office]] in [[1926]]. In [[1931]] he was promoted to Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. In [[1934]] he was appointed [[Lord Privy Seal]] and Minister for the [[League of Nations]] in [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s Government. Like many of his generation who had served in the First World War, Eden was strongly anti-war and strove to work through the League of Nations to preserve European peace. He was however among the first to recognise that peace could not be maintained by [[appeasement]] of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[fascist]] [[Italy]]. He privately opposed the policy of the Foreign Secretary, [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]], of trying to appease [[Italy]] during its [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invasion of Abyssinia]] ([[Ethiopia]]) in [[1935]]. When Hoare resigned after the failure of the [[Hoare-Laval Pact]], Eden succeeded him as Foreign Secretary.

At this stage in his career Eden was considered as something of a leader of fashion. He regularly wore a [[Homburg_(hat)|Homburg]] hat (similar to a [[bowler hat]] but with an upturned brim), which became forever known in Britain by his name.

He had an elder brother called Timothy and a younger brother, Nicholas, who had been killed when the Indefatigable had been sunk at the Battle of Jutland in 1916.

==Foreign Secretary==
Eden became Foreign Secretary at a time when Britain was having to adjust its foreign policy to face the rise of the fascist powers. He supported the policy of non-interference in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and supported [[Neville Chamberlain]] in his efforts to preserve peace through reasonable concessions to Germany. He did not protest when Britain and France failed to oppose [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] reoccupation of the [[Rhineland]] in [[1936]]. But in February [[1938]], he resigned because he could not accept Chamberlain's opening of negotiations with Italy. This made him an ally of [[Winston Churchill]], then a rebel backbench Conservative MP and leading critic of appeasement. There was much speculation that Eden would become a rallying point for all the disparate opponents of Chamberlain, but instead he maintained a low profile, avoiding confrontation though he opposed the [[Munich Agreement]]. As a result Eden's position declined heavily amongst politicians, though he remained popular in the country at large.

In September [[1939]], on the outbreak of war, Eden returned to Chamberlain's government as [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]], but was not in the [[War Cabinet]]. As a result he was not considered a candidate for the Premiership when Chamberlain resigned after Germany invaded [[France]] in May [[1940]] and Churchill became Prime Minister. He appointed Eden [[Secretary of State for War]]. Later in [[1940]] he returned to the Foreign Office, and in this role became a member of the executive committee of the [[Political Warfare Executive]] in [[1941]]. Although he was one of Churchill's closest confidents, his role in wartime was restricted because Churchill conducted the most important negotiations, with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Joseph Stalin]], himself, but Eden served loyally as Churchill's lieutenant. Nevertheless he was in charge of handling much of the relations between Britain and [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] during the last years of the war. In [[1942]] he was given the additional job of [[Leader of the House of Commons]].

After the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won the [[1945]] elections, Eden went into opposition as Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party. Many felt that Churchill should have retired and allowed Eden to become party leader, but Churchill refused to consider this and Eden was too loyal to press him. He was in any case depressed during this period by the break-up of his first marriage and the death of his eldest son, Simon Eden, in the last days of the war.

In [[1951]], the Conservatives returned to office and Eden became Foreign Secretary for a third time. Churchill was largely a figurehead in this government and Eden had effective control of British foreign policy for the first time, as the [[Cold War]] grew more intense. He dealt effectively with the various crises of the period, although Britain was no longer the world power it had been before the war. In [[1950]] he and Beatrice Eden were finally divorced and in [[1952]] he married Churchill's niece, Lady Clarissa Spencer-Churchill (b. 1920) -- a nominal Roman Catholic who was fiercely criticized by Catholic writer [[Evelyn Waugh]] for marrying a divorced man -- a marriage much more successful than his first had been. In [[1953]] Eden underwent a series of operations at Boston's Lahey Clinic to correct a minor gall bladder complaint. Unfortunately Eden's health never fully recovered; this was to undermine his subsequent career.  In [[1954]] he was made a [[Knight of the Garter]].

==Prime Minister==
[[Image:Anthony-Eden-arms.PNG|thumb|right|150px|Arms of Anthony Eden]]
In April [[1955]] Churchill finally retired, and Sir Anthony succeeded him as Prime Minister. Eden was a very popular figure, as a result of his long wartime service and also his famous good looks and charm. On taking office he immediately called a [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|general election]], at which the Conservatives were returned with an increased majority. But Sir Anthony had never held a domestic portfolio and had little experience in economic matters. He left these areas to his lieutenants such as [[Rab Butler]], and concentrated largely on foreign policy, forming a close alliance with U.S. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. His famous words &quot;Peace comes first, always&quot; added to his already substantial popularity.

This alliance proved illusory, however, when in [[1956]] Sir Anthony, in conjunction with France, tried to prevent [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], President of [[Egypt]], nationalising the [[Suez Canal]], which had been owned since the 19th century by British and French shareholders in the Suez Canal Company. Sir Anthony, drawing on his experience in the 1930s, saw Nasser as another [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]].  Sir Anthony considered the two men aggressive nationalist socialists determined to invade other countries.  Others believed that Nasser was acting from legitimate patriotic concerns.

In October [[1956]], after months of negotiation and attempts at mediation had failed to dissuade Nasser, Britain and France, in conjunction with [[Israel]], invaded Egypt and occupied the Suez Canal Zone. But Eisenhower immediately and strongly opposed the invasion.  The U.S. President was an advocate of [[decolonization|decolonisation]], because it would liberate colonies, strengthen U.S. interests, and presumably make other Arab and African leaders more sympathetic to the United States.  Eden had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the U.S. in the wake of World War II, and was forced to bow to American pressure to withdraw. The [[Suez Crisis]] is widely taken as marking the end of Britain (along with France) as a World power.

The Suez fiasco ruined Sir Anthony's reputation for [[statesmanship]] and led to a breakdown in his [[health]]. His Chancellor, [[Harold Macmillan]], despite having been one of the architects of Suez, manoeuvred Eden into resignation and succeeded him as Prime Minister in January [[1957]]. Eden retained his personal popularity and was made '''Earl of Avon''' in [[1961]].

==Retirement==
In retirement he lived quietly in Wiltshire with his second wife, and published a highly acclaimed personal memoir, ''Another World'', as well as several volumes of political memoirs. On a trip to the United States in [[1977]] his health rapidly deteriorated. At his request, [[James Callaghan]] sent the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] to fly him home to die. The Earl of Avon died from [[liver cancer]] in [[Salisbury, England|Salisbury]] in [[1977]] at the age of 79.

From [[1945]]-[[1973]], Eden was [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Birmingham]], [[England]]. He was recently voted the least effective British Prime Minister of the twentieth century by a BBC poll, which was topped by rival [[Clement Attlee]].

Eden's surviving son, [[Nicholas Eden, 2nd Earl of Avon|Nicholas Eden]] ([[1930]]-[[1985]]), known as Viscount Eden until [[1977]], was also a politician and was a minister in the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government until his premature death from [[AIDS]] at the age of 54.

The Papers of Eden are housed at the [[University of Birmingham]] Special Collections.

[[Image:Allsoul.jpg|thumb||300px|All Souls' Day by William Bouguereau]]
'''All Souls' Day''' (formally, ''Commemoratio omnium Fidelium Defunctorum'' or Commemoration of all the Faithful Departed), also called '''Defuncts' Day''' in Mexico and Belgium, is the day set apart in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for the commemoration of the [[afterlife|faithful departed]].  The celebration is based on the doctrine that the souls of the faithful which at death have not been cleansed from [[venial sin]]s, or have not atoned for past transgressions, cannot attain the [[beatific vision]], and that they may be helped to do so by [[prayer]] and by the sacrifice of the [[mass (liturgy)|mass]].

The feast falls on [[November 2]]. Traditionally, because [[Requiem]] [[Masses]] could not be celebrated on Sundays before Vatican II, the feast was transferred to [[November 3]] if [[November 2]] is a Sunday, but this is no longer observed in the [[Novus Ordo]].

==Christian origin==

The practice of setting apart a special day for intercession for certain of the faithful departed is very old.  But the first feast of general intercession was first established by [[Odilo]], [[abbot]] of [[Cluny]] (d. 1048).  The legend is given by [[Peter Damiani]] in his ''Life of St Odilo.'' According to this, a [[pilgrim]] returning from the [[Holy Land]] was cast by a [[storm]] on a desolate island.  A hermit living there told him that amid the rocks was a chasm communicating with [[purgatory]], from which perpetually rose the groans of tortured souls.  The hermit also claimed he had heard the [[demon]]s complaining of the efficacy of the prayers of the faithful, and especially the [[monk]]s of Cluny, in rescuing their victims.  Upon returning home, the pilgrim hastened to inform the abbot of Cluny, who then set [[2 November]] as a day of intercession on the part of his community for all the souls in purgatory.  The decree ordaining the celebration is printed in the Bollandist [[Acta Sanctorum]] (Saec.  VI, pt. i. p. 585).  From Cluny the custom spread to the other houses of the Cluniac order, was soon adopted in several [[diocese]]s in [[France]], and spread throughout the Western Church. In time the entire month of [[November]] became associated with prayer for the departed in the Western Catholic tradition. Nonetheless the [[2 November]] retained a special status as a day set apart for that purpose.

==Protestantism==

At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] the celebration of All Souls' Day was abolished in the [[Church of England]], though it was renewed in certain churches in connection with the &quot;Catholic revival&quot; of the 19th century. The observance was restored with the publication of the 1980 [[Alternative Service Book]], and it features in [[Common Worship]].

Among continental [[Protestantism|Protestant]]s its tradition has been more tenaciously maintained.  Even [[Martin Luther (religious leader)|Luther]]'s influence was not sufficient to abolish its celebration in [[Saxony]] during his lifetime; and, though its Ecclesiastical sanction soon lapsed even in the [[Lutheran]] Church, its memory survives strong in popular custom.  Just as it is the custom of [[French people]], of all ranks and creeds, to decorate the graves of their dead on the ''jour des morts'', so [[German people]] stream to the graveyards once a year with offerings of [[flower]]s.

==Pagan roots==

Certain popular beliefs connected with All Souls' Day are of [[Paganism|pagan]] origin and immemorial antiquity.  Thus the dead are believed by the peasantry of many Catholic countries to return to their former homes on All Souls' Night and partake of the food of the living.  In [[Tyrol]], cakes are left for them on the table and the room kept warm for their comfort.  In [[Brittany]], people flock to the cemeteries at nightfall to kneel bare-headed at the graves of their loved ones, and to toll the hollow of the [[tomb stone|tombstone]] with [[holy water]] or to pour libations of [[milk]] on it, and at bedtime the supper is left on the table for the souls. This tradition, though, certainly does not make Catholicism a pagan religion at all since it is the first Christian Church and denomination for over a 1,000 years.

'''André Paul Guillaume Gide''' ([[November 22]], [[1869]] &amp;ndash; [[February 19]], [[1951]]) was a [[France|French]] [[author]] and winner of the [[Nobel prize]] in literature in [[1947]]. Gide's career spanned from the [[symbolist]] movement to the advent of anticolonialism in-between the two [[World Wars]].

Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and puritan constraints, and gravitates around his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, even to the point of owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values. His political activity is informed by the same ethos, as suggested by his repudiation of [[communism]] after his [[1936]] voyage to the [[USSR]].

Known for his fiction as well as his autobiographical works, Gide exposes to public view the conflict and eventual reconciliation between the two sides of his personality, split apart by a straightlaced education and a narrow social moralism - as he perceives himself: the austere and refined [[Protestant]], and the divinely inspired - and no longer blushing - [[Pederasty|pederast]].

==Early life==

Gide was born in [[Paris]], France on [[November 22]], [[1869]]. His father was a Paris University professor of law and died [[1880]]. His uncle was the political economist [[Charles Gide]]. 

Gide was brought up in isolated conditions in [[Normandy]] and became a prolific writer at an early age, publishing in [[1891]] his first novel, ''The Notebooks of Andre Walter'' (French: ''Les Cahiers d'André Walter'').  

In [[1893]] and [[1894]] Gide traveled in northern [[Africa]]. He befriended [[Oscar Wilde]] in [[Algiers]] and there clearly recognized his own [[pederasty|pederastic]] orientation:

:&quot;But how can I describe my delirium at holding in my naked arms that perfect, savage little brown body, eager, lacivious? I spent a long time, after Mohammed had left me, in a state of trembling exaltation, and although I had reached the peak of pleasure five times with him, I re-lived my ecstasy again and again, and back at my room at the hotel prolonged the memories until dawn.  At the first pale light I got up; and ran, yes really ran, in sandals, far beyond Mustapha; a kind of lightness of the body and soul did not leave me all day.&quot; (''Si Le Grain Ne Meurt'').

Though sympathetic to the plight of homosexuals in his day, he never saw himself as one of them, claiming that, &quot;I was never homosexual, in the sense of finding men attractive.&quot;

==The middle years==

In [[1895]], after his mother's death, he married his cousin Madeleine Rondeaux but the marriage remained unconsummated.  In [[1896]] he was mayor of [[La Roque-Baignard]], a [[Commune in France|commune]] in [[Normandy]]. 

In [[1908]] Gide helped found the literary magazine ''Nouvelle Revue française'' (''The New French Review''). In [[1916]] [[Marc Allégret]], 16, becomes his lover. He was the son of Elie Allegret, best man at Gide's wedding. Of Allegret's five children, Andre Gide adopted Marc. The two elope to London, in retribution for which his wife burns all his correspondence, &quot;the best part of myself,&quot; as he was later to comment. In [[1918]] he met [[Dorothy Bussy]], who was his friend for over thirty years and who would translate all his works into English.

In the [[1920s]] Gide became an inspiration for writers like [[Albert Camus]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. In [[1923]] he published a book on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]; however, when he defended homosexuality in the public edition of ''[[Corydon]]'' ([[1924]]) he received widespread condemnation. He later considered this his most important work. 

In 1923 he conceived a daughter named Catherine with another woman, Elisabeth van Rysselberghe, daughter of his friend, the Belgian neo-impressionist painter [[Théo van Rysselberghe]]. His wife Madeleine died in [[1938]]. Later he used the background of his unconsummated marriage in his novel ''Et Nunc Manet in Te.'' The novel included passages about ponies and bananas. These works were unconventional at the time, and became instant classics ([[1951]]).

After [[1925]] he began to demand more humane conditions for criminals. In [[1926]] he published an autobiography, ''If it die'' (French: ''Si le grain ne meurt'').

==Africa==

From July 1926 to May [[1927]], he travelled through the [[French Equatorial Africa]] [[colony]] with his lover [[Marc Allégret]]. He went successively in [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]), in [[Oubangui-Chari]] (now the [[Central African Republic]]), briefly in [[Chad]] and then in [[Cameroun]] before returning to France. He related his peregrinations in a journal called ''[[Travels in the Congo]]'' (French: ''Voyage au Congo'') and ''Return from Chad'' (French: ''Retour du Tchad''). In this published journal, he criticized the behavior of French business interests in the Congo and inspired reform. In particular, he strongly criticized the ''Large Concessions'' regime (French: ''régime des Grandes Concessions''), i.e. a regime according to which part of the colony was conceded to French companies and where these companies could exploit all area's [[natural resource]]s, in particular [[rubber]]. He related for instance how natives were forced to leave their village during several weeks to collect rubber in the forest, and went as far as comparing their exploitation to [[slavery]].

==Russia==

During the [[1930s]] he briefly became a [[communism|communist]], but became disillusioned after his visit to [[Soviet Union]]. His criticism of communism caused him to lose many of his [[socialism|socialist]] friends, especially when he made a clean break with it in ''Retour de L'U.R.S.S.'' in [[1936]]. He was also a contributor to ''[[The God That Failed]]''.

==The 1940s==
Gide left France for [[Africa]] in [[1942]] and lived in [[Tunis]] until the end of [[World War II]]. In [[1947]], he received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

Gide died on [[February 19]], [[1951]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Applied statistics''' is the use of [[statistics]] and [[statistical theory]] in real-life situations.

Anyone committed to empirical observation as a means of knowing the universe about us can apply statistics as a research tool.  This obviously includes [[science]] but includes [[history]] and the [[art]]s as well.  For example, [[econometrics]] makes heavy use of applied statistics to study the [[economics|economy]].

In each of these areas, we need to observe, recognize the potential for error in our observations, and plan our research to control the [[observational error]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[Algorithm]]s for calculating [[variance]]''' play a minor role in [[statistics|statistical]] computing. A key problem in the design of good algorithms for this problem is that formulas for the variance may involve sums of squares, which can lead to numerical instability as well as to [[arithmetic overflow]] when dealing with large values.

== Algorithm I ==

A [[formula]] for calculating the variance of a [[statistical population|population]] of size ''n'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - (\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^2/n}{n}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

A formula for calculating an [[bias (statistics)|unbiased]] estimate of the population variance from a finite [[statistical sample|sample]] of ''n'' observations is:

:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - (\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^2/n}{n-1}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore a naive algorithm to calculate the estimated variance is given by the following [[pseudocode]]: 

 long n = 0
 double sum = 0
 double sum_sqr = 0
 
 foreach x in data:
   n += 1
   sum += x
   sum_sqr += x * x
 end for
 
 double mean = sum / n
 double variance = (sum_sqr - sum * mean) / (n - 1)

This algorithm can easily be adapted to compute the variance of a finite population: simply divide by ''n'' instead of &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; on the last line.

== Algorithm II ==

The following formulas can be used to update the [[mean]] and (estimated) variance of the sequence, for an additional element &lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{new}}&lt;/math&gt;. Here, ''m'' denotes the estimate of the population mean, ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; the estimate of the population variance, and ''n'' the number of elements in the sequence before the addition.

:&lt;math&gt;m_{\mathrm{new}} = \frac{n \; m_{\mathrm{old}} + x_{\mathrm{new}}}{n+1} = m_{\mathrm{old}} + \frac{x_{\mathrm{new}} - m_{\mathrm{old}}}{n+1} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s^2_{\mathrm{new}} = \frac{(n-1) \; s^2_{\mathrm{old}} + (x_{\mathrm{new}} - m_{\mathrm{new}}) \, (x_{\mathrm{new}} - m_{\mathrm{old}})}{n} \!&lt;/math&gt;

A numerically stable algorithm is given below.  It also computes the mean.
This algorithm is due to Knuth&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald E. Knuth]] (1998). ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'', volume 2: ''Seminumerical Algorithms'', 3rd edn., p. 232. Boston: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;,
who cites Welford&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Welford (1962). &quot;Note on a method for calculating corrected sums of squares and products&quot;. ''Technometrics'' 4(3):419–420.&lt;/ref&gt;.

 long n = 0
 double mean = 0
 double S = 0
 
 foreach x in data:
   n += 1
   double delta = x - mean
   mean += delta / n
   S += delta * (x - mean)  // This expression uses the new value of mean
 end for
 
 double variance = S / (n - 1)

== Example ==

Assume that all floating point operations use the standard [[IEEE 754#Double-precision 64 bit|IEEE 754 double-precision]] arithmetic. Consider the sample (4, 7, 13, 16) from an infinite population. Based on this sample, the estimated population mean is 10, and the estimated population variance is 30.  Both algorithms compute these values correctly.  Next consider the sample &lt;math&gt;(10^8+4, 10^8+7, 10^8+13, 10^8+16)&lt;/math&gt;, which gives rise to the same estimated variance as the first sample.  Algorithm II computes this variance estimate correctly, but Algorithm I returns 29.333333333333332 instead of 30.  While this loss of precision may be tolerable and viewed as a minor flaw of Algorithm I, it is easy to find data that reveal a major flaw in the naive algorithm: Take the sample to be &lt;math&gt;(10^9+4, 10^9+7, 10^9+13, 10^9+16)&lt;/math&gt;.  Again the estimated population variance of 30 is computed correctly by Algorithm II, but the naive algorithm now computes it as &amp;minus;170.66666666666666.  This is a serious problem with Algorithm I, since the variance can, by definition, never be negative.

The '''Almond''' (''Prunus dulcis'', [[synonymy|syn.]] ''Prunus amygdalus'', or ''Amygdalus communis'') is a small [[deciduous]] [[tree]] belonging to the subfamily [[Prunoideae]] of the family [[Rosaceae]]. An ''almond'' is also the [[fruit]] of this tree. It is classified with the [[peach]] in the subgenus ''Amygdalus'' within ''[[Prunus]]'', distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated seed shell. 

The fruit lacks the sweet fleshy outer covering of other members of ''Prunus'' (such as the [[plum]] and [[cherry]]), this being replaced by a leathery coat, called a hull, which contains the edible kernel, commonly called a [[nut]], inside a hard shell.  In botanical parlance, the reticulated hard stony shell is called an [[endocarp]], and the fruit, or [[exocarp]], is a [[drupe]], having a downy outer coat.

The tree is probably a native of southwest [[Asia]] and north [[Africa]], but has been so extensively cultivated for so long over the warm temperate regions of the Old World that its original natural distribution is obscure. It can ripen fruit as far north as the [[British Isles]]. It is a tree of moderate size; the leaves are lanceolate, and serrated at the edges; and it flowers early in spring.

==Production==
Global production of almonds is around 1.5 million tonnes, with a low of 1 million tonnes in 1995 and a peak of 1.85 million tonnes in 2002 [http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/Hort_Circular/2004/12-10-04/12-04%20Almonds.pdf FAO figures (pdf file)]. Major producers include [[Greece]], [[Iran]], [[Italy]], [[Morocco]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United States]]. In Spain, numerous commercial cultivars of sweet almond are produced, most notably the Jordan almond (imported from [[Málaga]]) and the [[Valencia]] almond. In the United States, production is concentrated in [[California]], with almonds being California's sixth leading argicultrual product and its top agricultural export. California exported almonds valued at 1.08 billion dollars in 2003, about 70% of total California almond crop.

==Pollination==
{{ImageStackRight|200|
[[image:Almond blossoms closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Almond flowers]]
[[Image:Unripe almond on tree.jpg|thumb|Unripe almond on tree]]
[[Image:Almonds_th.jpg|thumb|right|Almonds (in the shell and out of it)]]}}
The [[pollination]] of California's almonds is the largest annual [[Pollination management|managed pollination]] event in the world, with close to one million hives (nearly half of all [[beehive (beekeeping)|beehives]] in the USA) being trucked in February to the almond groves. Much of the pollination is managed by pollination brokers, who contract with migratory [[beekeeper]]s from at least 38 states for the event.

==Sweet and bitter almond==
There are two forms of the plant, one (often with white flowers) producing [[sweet]] almonds, and the other (often with pink flowers) producing [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]] almonds. The kernel of the former contains a fixed oil and emulsion. As late as the early 20th century the oil was used internally in medicine, with the stipulation that it must not be adulterated with that of the bitter almond; it remains fairly popular in [[alternative medicine]], particularly as a [[carrier oil]] in [[aromatherapy]], but has fallen out of prescription among doctors.

The bitter almond is rather broader and shorter than the sweet almond, and contains about 50% of the fixed oil which also occurs in sweet almonds. It also contains a ferment emulsion which, in the presence of water, acts on a [[soluble]] [[glucoside]], [[amygdalin]], yielding [[glucose]], [[cyanide]] and the [[essential oil]] of bitter almonds or [[benzaldehyde]]. Bitter almonds may yield from 6 to 8% of prussic acid (also known as [[hydrogen cyanide]]). Extract of bitter almond was once used medicinally but even in small doses effects are severe and in larger doses can be deadly; the prussic acid must be removed before consumption.

==Almond oil==
&quot;Oleum Amygdalae&quot;, the fixed oil, is prepared from either variety of almond and is a glyceryl oleate, with slight odour and a nutty taste. It is almost insoluble in [[ethanol|alcohol]] but readily soluble in [[chloroform]] or [[diethyl ether|ether]]. It may be used as a substitute for [[olive oil]]. 

The sweet almond oil is obtained from the dried [[seed|kernel]] of the plant. This oil has been traditionally used by [[massage therapist]]s to lubricate the skin during a massage session, being considered by many to be an effective [[emollient]].

==Culinary uses==
While the almond is most often eaten raw, it is used in some dishes.  It, along with other nuts, is often sprinkled over desserts, particularly sundaes and other ice cream based dishes.  It is also used in [[Baklava]]. There is also almond butter, a spread similar to [[peanut butter]], popular with peanut allergy sufferers and for its less salty taste.

The sweet almond itself contains practically no [[starch]] and may therefore be made into flour for cakes and biscuits for patients suffering from [[diabetes mellitus]] or any other form of [[glycosuria]]. Almond extract is also a popular substitute for [[vanilla]] extract among people with diabetes. Sweet almonds are used in [[marzipan]], [[nougat]], and [[macaroon]]s, as well as other desserts. Almonds are a rich source of [[Vitamin E]], containing 24 mg per 100 grammes [http://www.allaboutvision.com/nutrition/vitamin_e.htm]. They are also rich in [[monounsaturated fat]], one of the two &quot;good&quot; fats responsible for lowering [[LDL cholesterol]].

In China, almonds are used in a popular dessert when it is mixed with milk and then served hot.

==Cultural aspects==
The almond is highly revered in some cultures. Among the [[Hebrews]], it was a symbol of watchfulness and promise due to its early flowering, while the [[China|Chinese]] consider it a symbol of enduring sadness and female beauty. In India, consumption of almonds is considered to be good for the brain. Christian symbolism often uses almond branches as a symbol of the [[Virgin Birth]] of [[Jesus]]; paintings often include almonds encircling the [[Child Jesus|baby Jesus]] and as a symbol of [[Mary]]. In the [[Bible]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 17) [[Aaron]] is chosen among the other tribes of Israel by a rod that brought forth almond flowers. Today, Jews still carry rods of almond blossom to the synagogues on great festival days. The fruit of the almond supplied a model for certain kinds of ornamental carved work ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25:33-34; 37:19-20).  In a similar legend, [[Pope Urban]] once declared that a man named [[Tannhäuser]] would not receive forgiveness until his wooden staff bloomed again. This occurred after three days, but Tannhauser could not be found. The nut of the tree has also been used as a preventative for [[ethanol|alcohol]] [[intoxication]]. Folklore claims that almonds are poisonous for [[fox]]es. The tree grows in [[Syria]] and [[Israel]], and is referred to in the [[Bible]] under the name of &quot;Shaked&quot;, meaning &quot;hasten&quot;. The word &quot;Luz&quot;, which occurs in [[Book of Genesis|Genisis]] 30:37, and which some translations have as &quot;hazel&quot;, is supposed to be another name for the almond. In Israel the tree flowers in January. The application of &quot;Shaked&quot; or &quot;hasten&quot; to the almond is similar to the use of the name &quot;May&quot; for the hawthorn, which usually flowers in that month in Britain.  

==Etymology==
The word 'almond' comes from the Old French ''almande'' or ''alemande'', late Latin ''amandola'', derived through a form ''amingdola'' from the Greek ''amugdale'', an almond; the al- for a- may be due to a confusion with the Arabic article ''al'', the word having first dropped the a- as in the Italian form ''mandorla''; the British pronunciation ''ar-mond'' and the modern French ''amande'' show the true form of the word. 

In parts of Northern California, where almonds are a main crop, the word is often pronounced with a unique regional accent. Rather than the usual American pronunciation of &quot;Ahl-mond&quot;, with the soft A and L, it is pronounced with a hard A and nearly silent H, as in &quot;Aah-men”. This method of pronunciation is particularly prevalent near the city of [[Chico, California|Chico]] in Butte County, but it is also heard in nearby Glenn, Colusa, and Tehama Counties.

'''[[Antigua and Barbuda]]'s [[economics|economy]]''' is service-based, with [[tourism]] and government services representing the key sources of employment and income. Tourism accounts directly or indirectly for more than half of [[gross domestic product|GDP]] and is also the principal earner of foreign exchange in Antigua and Barbuda. However, a series of violent [[hurricane]]s since 1995 resulted in serious damage to tourist [[infrastructure]] and periods of sharp reductions in visitor numbers. In 1999 the budding offshore financial sector was seriously hurt by financial sanctions imposed by the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] as a result of the loosening of its money-laundering controls. The government has made efforts to comply with international demands in order to get the sanctions lifted. The dual island nation's agricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic market; the sector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor shortages that reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialized world, especially in the US, which accounts for about one-third of all tourist arrivals. Estimated overall economic growth for 2000 was 2.5%. Inflation has trended down going from above 2 percent in the 1995-99 period and estimated at 0 percent in 2000.

To lessen its vulnerability to natural disasters, Antigua has been diversifying its economy. Transportation, communications and financial services are becoming important.

Antigua is a member of the [[Eastern Caribbean Currency Union]] (ECCU). The [[Eastern Caribbean Central Bank]] (ECCB) issues a common currency (the [[East Caribbean Dollar]]) for all members of the ECCU. The ECCB also manages monetary policy, and regulates and supervises commercial banking activities in its member countries.

Antigua and Barbuda is a beneficiary of the U.S. [[Caribbean Basin Initiative]]. Its 1998 exports to the U.S. were valued at aboutUS $3 million and its U.S. imports totaled about US $84 million. It also belongs to the predominantly English-speaking [[Caribbean_Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM]]).

[[Antigua and Barbuda]] maintains diplomatic relations with the [[United States]], [[Canada]] the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[People's Republic of China]], as well as with many Latin American countries and neighboring Eastern Caribbean states. It is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]], and the Eastern Caribbean's [[Regional Security System]] (RSS).

As a member of [[CARICOM]], Antigua and Barbuda supported efforts by the United States to implement UN Security Council Resolution 940, designed to facilitate the departure of Haiti's de facto authorities from power. The country agreed to contribute personnel to the multinational force which restored the democratically elected government of Haiti in October 1994.

In May 1997, Prime Minister Bird joined 14 other Caribbean leaders and President Clinton for the first-ever U.S.-regional summit in Bridgetown, Barbados. The summit strengthened the basis for regional cooperation on justice and counter-narcotics issues, finance and development, and trade.

'''Disputes - international:'''
none

'''Illicit drugs:'''
considered a minor transshipment point for narcotics bound for the US and Europe; more significant as a drug-money-laundering center

[[Image:Der ewige jude.jpg|thumb|''[[Der ewige Jude|The Eternal Jew]]'': 1937 German poster. In his hands are &quot;Zuckerbrot und Peitsche&quot;, or &quot;cookies and knout&quot;, an allusion to a saying similar to that of &quot;carrot and stick&quot;.]]
'''Anti-Semitism''' (alternatively spelled '''antisemitism''') is hostility toward or [[prejudice]] against [[Jew]]s as a religious, ethnic, or racial group, which can range from individual [[hatred]] to institutionalized, violent [[persecution]]. The highly explicit [[Nuremberg laws|ideology]] of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazism]] was the most extreme example of this phenomenon, leading to a [[genocide]] of the European Jewry. Anti-Semitism has historically taken different forms:
*[[Religion|Religious]] anti-Semitism, or [[anti-Judaism]]. Before the 19th century, most anti-Semitism was primarily religious in nature, based on [[Christian]] or [[Islam]]ic interactions with and interpretations of [[Judaism]]. Since Judaism was generally the largest [[minority]] religion in Christian [[Europe]] and much of the Islamic world, Jews were often the primary targets of religiously-motivated violence and persecution from Christian, and to a lesser degree, Islamic rulers. Unlike anti-Semitism in general, this form of prejudice is directed at the religion itself, and so generally does not affect those of Jewish [[kinship and descent|ancestry]] who have [[religious conversion|converted]] to another religion, although the case of [[Converso]]s in [[Spain]] was a notable exception. Laws banning Jewish religious practices may be rooted in religious anti-Semitism, as were the [[expulsion]]s of the Jews that happened throughout the [[Middle Ages]].
*[[Racism|Racial]] anti-Semitism. With its origins in the [[cultural anthropology|anthropological]] ideas of [[race]] that started during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], racial anti-Semitism became the dominant form of anti-Semitism from the late 19th century through today.  Racial anti-Semitism replaced the hatred of Judaism as a religion with the idea that the Jews themselves were a racially distinct group, regardless of their religious practice, and that they were inferior or worthy of animosity. With the rise of racial anti-Semitism, [[conspiracy theories]] about Jewish plots in which Jews were somehow acting in concert to dominate the world became a popular form of anti-Semitic expression. 

Some analysts and Jewish groups believe that there is a distinctly new form of late 20th century anti-Semitism, often called [[new anti-Semitism]], which borrows language and concepts from [[anti-Zionism]], but which attacks Jews as a group, rather than [[Zionism]] as a movement. A second group of observers [[Anti-Zionism#Anti-Zionism dictionary definitions|controversially]] identify anti-Zionism itself with anti-Semitism, arguing that anti-Zionism, &quot;advocates denial of the right to self-determination of the Jewish people&quot; (Matas 2005, p. 31).

== Etymology and usage ==
[[Image:Bookcover-1880-Marr-German uber Juden.jpg|left|thumb|120px|Cover page of Marr's ''The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism'', 1880 edition]]
The word ''antisemitic'' (''{{lang|de|antisemitisch}}'' in German) was probably first used in 1860 by the Jewish [[scholar]] [[Moritz Steinschneider]] in the [[phrase]] &quot;antisemitic prejudices&quot; ({{lang-de|&quot;antisemitische Vorurteile&quot;}}). Steinschneider used this phrase to characterize [[Ernest Renan]]'s ideas about how &quot;[[Semitic]] races&quot; were inferior to &quot;[[Aryan]] races.&quot; These pseudo-scientific theories had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as [[Prussia]]n nationalistic historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] did much to promote this form of racism. In Treitschke's writings ''Semitic'' was practically [[synonym|synonymous]] with ''Jewish''. 
German political agitator [[Wilhelm Marr]] coined the related [[German language|German]] word ''Antisemitismus'' in his book ''&quot;The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism&quot;'' in 1879.  Marr used the phrase to mean ''Jew-hatred'' or ''Judenhass,'' and he used the new word ''antisemitism'' to make hatred of the Jews seem rational and sanctioned by scientific knowledge. Marr's book became very popular, and in the same year he founded the ''&quot;League of Anti-Semites&quot;'' (&quot;Antisemiten-Liga&quot;), the first [[Germany|German]] organization committed specifically to combatting the alleged threat to Germany posed by the Jews, and advocating their [[population transfer|forced removal]] from the country. 

So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ''&quot;Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte,&quot;'' and [[Wilhelm Scherer]] used the term &quot;Antisemiten&quot; in the ''&quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot;'' of January. The related word ''[[semitism]]'' was coined around 1885. See also the coinage of the term &quot;[[Definitions of Palestine and Palestinian#Referring to Jews in a national rather than religious sense|Palestinian]]&quot; by Germans to refer to the nation or people known as [[Jew]]s, as distinct from the religion of [[Judaism]]. 

Despite the use of the prefix &quot;anti,&quot; the terms ''Semitic'' and ''Anti-Semitic'' are not [[antonym]]s. To avoid the confusion of the [[misnomer]], many scholars on the subject (such as [[Emil Fackenheim]] of the [[Hebrew University]]) now favor the unhyphenated term ''antisemitism''. [[Yehuda Bauer]] articulated this view in his writings and lectures: (the term) &quot;Antisemitism, especially in its [[hyphen]]ated spelling, is inane nonsense, because there is no [[Semitism]] that you can be [[anti]] to.&quot; [http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf], also in his ''A History of the Holocaust'', p.52) 

The term ''anti-Semitism'' has historically referred to prejudice towards [[Jew]]s alone, and this was the only use of this word for more than a century. It does not traditionally refer to prejudice toward other people who speak [[Semitic language]]s (e.g. [[Arab]]s or [[Syriacs]]). [[Bernard Lewis]], Professor of Near Eastern Studies Emeritus at Princeton University, says that &quot;Anti-Semitism has never anywhere been concerned with anyone but Jews.&quot;[http://middleeastinfo.org/library/lewis_antisemitism.html] 

In recent decades some groups have argued that the term should be extended to include prejudice against Arabs, [[Anti-Arabism]], in the context of accusations of Arab anti-Semitism; further, some, including the [[Islamic Association of Palestine]], have argued that this implies that Arabs can not, ''by definition'', be anti-Semitic, despite the acknowledged high level of [[Arab anti-Semitism]]. The argument for such extension comes out of the claim that since the [[Semitic]] [[language family]] includes Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic languages, and the historical term &quot;Semite&quot; refers to all those who consider themselves descendants of the Biblical [[Shem]], anti-Semitism should be likewise inclusive. This usage is not generally accepted.

=== Definitions of the term  ===
[[Image:Antisemiticroths.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-semitic caricature (France, 1898)]]

Though the general definition of anti-Semitism is hostility or prejudice towards [[Jew]]s, a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions. [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] scholar and [[City University of New York]] professor Helen Fein's definition has been particularly influential. She defines anti-Semitism as &quot;a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions – social or legal discrimination, political mobilisation against the Jews, and collective or state violence – which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews.&quot;

Professor Dietz Bering of the [[University of Cologne]] further expanded on Professor Fein's definition by describing the structure of anti-Semitic beliefs. To anti-Semites: &quot;Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character.&quot;

There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to formally define anti-Semitism.  The United States Department of State defines anti-Semitism in its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism as &quot;hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity.&quot;

In 2005, the [[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]] (EUMC), a body of the [[European Union]], developed a more detailed working definition: &quot;Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. In addition, such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for 'why things go wrong'.&quot; 

The EUMC then listed &quot;contemporary examples of anti-Semitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere.&quot;  These included: Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews; accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group; denying the Holocaust; and accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations. The EUMC also discussed ways in which attacking Israel could be anti-Semitic, depending on the context (see [[#Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism|anti-Zionism]] below). [http://eumc.eu.int/eumc/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf]

==Earliest Antisemitism==
The earliest occurrence of antisemitism has been the subject of debate among scholars.  Professor Peter Schafer of the Freie University of Berlin has argued that antisemitism was first spread by &quot;the Greek retelling of ancient Egyptian prejudices&quot;.  In view of the anti-Jewish writings of the Egyptian priest Manetho, Schafer suggests that anti-Semitism may have emerged &quot;in Egypt alone&quot;.  The hostility commonly faced by Jews in the Diaspora has been extensively described by John M. G. Barclay of the University of Durham.  The ancient Jewish philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] described an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in ''Flaccus'', in which thousands of Jews died.  In the analysis of Pieter W. Van Der Horst, the cause of the violence in Alexandria was that Jews had been portrayed as misanthropes.  Gideon Bohak has argued that early animosity against Jews was not anti-Judaism unless it arose from attitudes held against Jews alone.  Using this stricter definition, Bohak says that many Greeks had animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians.  The 150 BCE suppression of Jewish religious practice by use of deadly force against civilians, as recounted in [[1 Maccabees]], then qualifies as anti-Judaism in a broader sense of the term than is used by Bohak.  There are other examples of [[History of anti-Semitism#Ancient animosity towards Jews|ancient animosity towards Jews]] that are not considered by all to fall within the definition of anti-semitism.

===Anti-Judaism in the New Testament===
The New Testament is a collection of 'books' written by various authors.  Most of this collection was written by the end of the first century.  The majority of the New Testament was written by Jews who became followers of Jesus, and all but two books (Luke and Acts) are traditionally attributed to such Jewish followers.  Nevertheless, there are a number of passages in the New Testament that some see as anti-Semitic, or have been used for anti-Semitic purposes, most notably:

:Jesus speaking to a group of [[Pharisees]]: &quot;''I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.  They answered him, &quot;Abraham is our father.&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;If you were Abraham's children, you would do what Abraham did. ... You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies. But, because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason why you do not hear them is you are not of God.''&quot; ([[Book of John|John]] 8:37-39, 44-47, [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]]) 

:[[Saint Stephen|Stephen]] speaking before a synagogue council just before his execution: &quot;''You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it.''&quot; ([[Book of Acts|Acts]] 7:51-53, RSV)

:&quot;''Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie -- behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and learn that I have loved you.''&quot; ([[Revelation]] 3:9, RSV).

Some biblical scholars point out that Jesus and Stephen are presented as Jews speaking to other Jews, and that their use of broad accusation against Israel is borrowed from Moses and the later Jewish prophets (e.g. Deut 9:13-14; 31:27-29; 32:5, 20-21; 2 Kings 17:13-14; Is 1:4; Hos 1:9; 10:9).  Jesus once calls his own disciple Peter 'Satan' (Mk 8:33). Other scholars hold that verses like these reflect the Jewish-Christian tensions that were emerging in the late first or early second century, and do not originate with Jesus. Today, nearly all Christian denominations de-emphasize verses such as these, and reject their use and misuse by anti-Semites.  

Drawing from the Jewish prophet Jeremiah (Jer 31:31-34), the [[New Testament]] taught that with the death of Jesus a [[new covenant]] was established which rendered obsolete and in many respects superseded the first covenant established by Moses (Heb 8:7-13; Lk 22:20).  Observance of the earlier covenant traditionally characterizes [[Judaism]].  This New Testament teaching, and later variations to it, are part of what is called [[supersessionism]].  However, the early Jewish followers of Jesus continued to practice circumcision and observe dietary laws, which is why the failure to observe these laws by the first Gentile Christians became a matter of controversy and dispute some years after Jesus' death (Acts 11:3; 15:1ff; 16:3).

The New Testament holds that Jesus' (Jewish) disciple Judas Iscariot (Mk 14:43-46), the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate along with Roman forces (Jn 19:11; Acts 4:27) and Jewish leaders and people of Jerusalem were (to varying degrees) responsible for the death of Jesus (Acts 13:27); Diaspora Jews are not blamed for events which were clearly outside their control.

After Jesus' death, the New Testament portrays the Jewish religious authorities in Jerusalem as hostile to Jesus' followers, and as occasionally using force against them.  Stephen is executed by stoning (Acts 7:58).  Before his conversion, Saul puts followers of Jesus in prison (Acts 8:3; Gal 1:13-14; 1 Tim 1:13).  After his conversion, Saul is whipped at various times by Jewish authorities (2 Cor 11:24), and is accused by Jewish authorities before Roman courts (e.g., Acts 25:6-7).  However, opposition from Gentiles is also cited repeatedly (2 Cor 11:26; Acts 16:19ff; 19:23ff).  More generally, there are widespread references in the New Testament to suffering experienced by Jesus' followers at the hands of others (Rom 8:35;1 Cor 4:11ff; Gal 3:4; 2 Thess 1:5; Heb 10:32; 1 Pet 4:16; Rev 20:4).

===Early Christianity===
A number of early and influential Church works -- such as the dialogues of [[Justin Martyr]], the homilies of [[John Chrysostom]], and the testimonies of church father [[Cyprian]] -- are strongly anti-Jewish.

During a discussion on the celebration of [[Easter]] during the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in AD 325, Roman emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/25023.htm said] &lt;blockquote&gt; ...it appeared an unworthy thing that in the celebration of this most holy feast we should follow the practice of the Jews, who have impiously defiled their hands with enormous sin, and are, therefore, deservedly afflicted with blindness of soul. (...) Let us then have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd; for we have received from our Saviour a different way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prejudice against Jews in the [[Roman Empire]] was formalized in 438, when the ''Code of [[Theodosius II]]'' established Roman Catholic Christianity as the only legal religion in the Roman Empire.  The [[Justinian Code]] a century later stripped Jews of many of their rights, and Church councils throughout the sixth and seventh century, including the Council of Orleans, further enforced anti-Jewish provisions.  These restrictions began as early as 305, when, in Elvira, (now [[Granada]]), a Spanish town in [[Andalusia]], the first known laws of any church council against Jews appeared. Christian women were forbidden to marry Jews unless the Jew first converted to Catholicism. Jews were forbidden to extend hospitality to Catholics. Jews could not keep Catholic Christian [[concubine]]s and were forbidden to bless the fields of Catholics. In 589, in Catholic Spain, the Third Council of Toledo ordered that children born of marriage between Jews and Catholic be baptized by force. By the Twelfth Council of Toledo (681) a policy of forced conversion of all Jews was initiated (Liber Judicum, II.2 as given in Roth). Thousands fled, and thousands of others converted to Roman Catholicism.

=== Anti-Semitism in the Middle Ages ===
[[Image:Talmudtrial.jpg|thumb|250px|1239. In the course of a [[disputation]], [[Pope Gregory IX]] ordered the [[Talmud]] burned (note a non-[[heretic]]al book floating above the fire). A 15th century painting by [[Pedro Berruguete]].]]

In the [[Middle Ages]] a main justification of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. Though not part of [[Catholic]] [[dogma]], many Christians, including members of the clergy, have held the Jewish people collectively responsible for killing Jesus (see [[Deicide]]), a practice originated by [[Melito of Sardis]]. As stated in the Boston College Guide to Passion Plays, &quot;Over the course of time, Christians began to accept... that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus’ death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of deicide, or God-killing. For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in Europe and America.&quot;[http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/pdf/ViewersGuide.pdf] This accusation was repudiated in 1964, when the Catholic Church under [[Pope Paul VI]] issued the document [[Nostra Aetate]] as a part of [[Vatican II]].  

As the [[Black Death]] [[epidemics]] devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, rumors spread that Jews caused it by deliberately [[well poisoning|poisoning wells]]. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence. 
&quot;Never mind that Jews were not immune from the ravages of the [[bubonic plague|plague]]; they were tortured until they &quot;confessed&quot; to crimes that they could not possibly have committed. In one such case, a man named Agimet was ... coerced to say that Rabbi Peyret of Chambery (near [[Geneva]]) had ordered him to poison the wells in [[Venice]], [[Toulouse]], and elsewhere. In the aftermath of Agimet’s &quot;confession,&quot; the Jews of [[Strasbourg]] were burned alive on February 14, 1349. (Source: ''Jews: The Essence and Character of a People'' by Arthur Hertzberg and Aron Hirt-Manheimer, p.84)

Among socio-economic factors were restrictions by the authorities, local rulers and frequently church officials who closed many professions to the Jews, pushing them into marginal occupations considered socially inferior, such as local tax and rent collecting or moneylending, a necessary evil due to the increasing population and urbanization during the High Middle Ages. Catholic doctrine of the time held that moneylending for interest was a [[sin]], and as such Jews tended to dominate this business. This provided support for claims that Jews are insolent, greedy, engaged in [[usury]], and in itself contributed to a negative image. Natural tensions between creditors (typically Jews) and debtors (typically Christians) were added to social, political, religious and economic strains. Peasants who were forced to pay their taxes to  Jews could personify them as the people taking their earnings while remaining loyal to the lords on whose behalf the Jews worked. 

==== The demonizing of the Jews ====
From around the 12th century through the [[19th century|19th]] there were Christians who believed that some (or all) Jews possessed magical powers; some believed that they had gained these magical powers from making a deal with the [[devil]]. See also [[Judensau]], [[Judeophobia]].

==== Blood libels ====
''Main articles: [[blood libel]], [[list of blood libels against Jews]]''

On many occasions, Jews were accused of a [[blood libel]], the supposed drinking of blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian [[Eucharist]]. According to the authors of these blood libels, the 'procedure' for the alleged sacrifice was something like this: a child who had not yet reached puberty was kidnapped and taken to a hidden place. The child would be tortured by Jews, and a crowd would gather at the place of execution (in some accounts the synagogue itself) and engage in a mock tribunal to try the child. The child would be presented to the tribunal naked and tied and eventually be condemned to death. In the end, the child would be crowned with thorns and tied or nailed to a wooden cross. The cross would be raised, and the blood dripping from the child's wounds would be caught in bowls or glasses. Finally, the child would be killed with a thrust through the heart from a spear, sword, or dagger. Its dead body would be removed from the cross and concealed or disposed of, but in some instances rituals of black magic would be performed on it. This method, with some variations, can be found in all the alleged Christian descriptions of ritual murder by Jews.

The story of [[William of Norwich]] (d. 1144) is the first known case of ritual murder being alleged by a Christian monk while the story of [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]] (d. 1255) said that after the boy was dead, his body was removed from the cross and laid on a table. His belly was cut open and his entrails removed for some occult purpose, such as a [[haruspex|divination ritual]]. The story of [[Simon of Trent]] (d. 1475) emphasized how the boy was held over a large bowl so all his blood could be collected. Simon was regarded as a saint, and was canonized by [[Pope Sixtus V]] in 1588. The cult of Simon was disbanded in 1965 by [[Pope Paul VI]], and the shrine erected to him was dismantled. He was removed from the calendar, and his future veneration was forbidden, though a handful of extremists still promote the narrative as a fact. In the 20th century, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia and the [[Kielce pogrom]] represented incidents of blood libel in Europe, while more recently blood libel stories have appeared a number of times in the state-sponsored media of a number of Arab nations, in Arab television shows, and on websites.

==== Host desecration ====
[[Image:Descreationofhost.gif|thumb|right|150px|A 15th century German woodcut showing an alleged host desecration. In the first panel the hosts are stolen, in the second the hosts bleed when pierced by a Jew, in the third the Jews are arrested, and in the fourth they are burned alive.]]
Jews were falsely accused of torturing consecrated host wafers in a reenactment of the [[Crucifixion]]; this accusation was known as ''[[host desecration]]''.

=== Disabilities and Restrictions ===
[[Image:BritLibCottonNeroD1Fol183vPersecutedJews.jpg|thumb|left|The yellow badge Jews were forced to wear can be seen in this marginal illustration from an English manuscript.]]

Jews were subject to a wide range of legal restrictions throughout the Middle Ages, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century.  Jews were excluded from many trades, the list of excluded occupations varying in different communities, and being determined largely by the political influence of various non-Jewish competing interests. Frequently all occupations were barred against Jews, except money-lending and peddling—even these at times being prohibited. The number of Jews or Jewish families permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghettos]], and were not allowed to own land; and they were subjected to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own, forced to swear special [[Oath More Judaico|Jewish Oaths]], and a variety of other measures, including restrictions on dress. 

====Clothing====
''Main article: [[yellow badge]], [[Judenhut]]''

The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 was the first to proclaim the requirement for Jews to wear something that distinguished them as Jews. It could be a colored piece of cloth in the shape of a star or circle or square, a hat ([[Judenhut]]), or a robe. In many localities, members of the medieval society wore badges to distinguish their social status. Some badges (such as [[guild]] members) were prestigious, while others ostracized outcasts such as [[leper]]s, reformed [[heretic]]s and [[prostitute]]s. Jews sought to evade the [[Jewish badge|badges]] by paying what amounted to bribes in the form of temporary &quot;exemptions&quot; to kings, which were revoked and re-paid whenever the king needed to raise funds.

=== The Crusades ===
The '''[[Crusade]]s''' were a series of several military campaigns sanctioned by the [[Papacy]] that took place during the [[11th century|11th]] through [[13th century|13th centuries]]. They began as [[Catholic]] endeavors to capture [[Jerusalem]] from the [[Islam|Muslims]] but developed into territorial wars. 

The mobs accompanying the first three Crusades attacked the Jewish communities in Germany, France, and England, and put many Jews to death.  Entire communities, like those of Treves, Speyer, Worms, Mayence, and Cologne, were slain during the first Crusade by a mob army. About 12,000 Jews are said to have perished in the Rhenish cities alone between May and July, 1096. Before the Crusades the Jews had practically a monopoly of trade in Eastern products, but the closer connection between Europe and the East brought about by the Crusades raised up a class of merchant traders among the Christians, and from this time onward restrictions on the sale of goods by Jews became frequent. The religious zeal fomented by the Crusades at times burned as fiercely against the Jews as against the Muslims, though attempts were made by bishops during the [[First crusade]] and the papacy during the [[Second Crusade]] to stop Jews from being attacked. Both economically and socially the Crusades were disastrous for European Jews. They prepared the way for the anti-Jewish legislation of [[Pope Innocent III]], and formed the turning-point in the medieval history of the Jews.

=== The expulsions from England, France, Germany, and Spain ===
''Only a few expulsions of the Jews are described in this section, for a more extended list see [[History of anti-Semitism]], and also the [[History of the Jews in England]], [[History of the Jews in Germany|Germany]], [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spain]], and [[History of the Jews in France|France]].''

The practice of expelling the Jews accompanied by confiscation of their property, followed by temporary readmissions for [[ransom]], was utilized to enrich the French crown during [[12th century|12th]]-[[14th century|14th]] centuries. The most notable such expulsions were: from [[Paris]] by [[Philip Augustus of France|Philip Augustus]] in 1182, from the entirety of France by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in 1254, by [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] in 1322, by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1359, by [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] in 1394.

To finance his war to conquer [[Wales]], [[Edward I of England]] taxed the Jewish moneylenders. When the Jews could no longer pay, they were accused of disloyalty. Already restricted to a limited number of occupations, the Jews saw Edward abolish their &quot;privilege&quot; to lend money, choke their movements and activities and were forced to wear a [[Yellow badge|yellow patch]]. The heads of Jewish households were then arrested, over 300 of them taken to the [[Tower of London]] and executed, while others killed in their homes. The complete banishment of all Jews from the country in 1290 led to thousands killed and drowned while fleeing and the absence of Jews from England for three and a half centuries, until 1655, when [[Oliver Cromwell]] reversed the policy.

In 1492, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella of Castile]] issued ''General Edict on the Expulsion of the Jews'' from [[Spain]] (''see also [[Spanish Inquisition]]'') and many [[Sephardi]] Jews fled to the [[Ottoman Empire]], some to the [[Land of Israel]]. 

In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] limited [[Breslau]] to only ten so-called &quot;protected&quot; Jewish families and encouraged similar practice in other [[Prussia]]n cities. In 1750 he issued ''Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft'': the &quot;protected&quot; Jews had an alternative to &quot;either abstain from marriage or leave Berlin&quot; (quoting [[Simon Dubnow]]). In the same year, Archduchess of [[Austria]] [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered Jews out of [[Bohemia]] but soon reversed her position, on condition that Jews pay for readmission every ten years. This [[extortion]] was known as ''malke-geld'' (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] abolished most of persecution practices in his ''Toleranzpatent'', on the condition that [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] are eliminated from public records and judicial autonomy is annulled. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] wrote that &quot;Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution&quot;.

=== Anti-Judaism and the Reformation ===
[[Image:1543 On the Jews and Their Lies by Martin Luther.jpg|thumb|180px|Luther's 1543 pamphlet ''On the Jews and Their Lies'']]
{{main|Christianity and anti-Semitism}}

[[Martin Luther]], an [[Augustinian]] [[monasticism|monk]] and an [[ecclesiastical]] reformer whose teachings inspired the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], wrote antagonistically about Jews in his book ''On the Jews and their Lies'', which describes the Jews in extremely harsh terms, excoriating them, and providing detailed recommendation for a [[pogrom]] against them and their permanent oppression and/or expulsion.  According to [[Paul Johnson (journalist)|Paul Johnson]], it &quot;may be termed the first work of modern anti-Semitism, and a giant step forward on the road to the Holocaust.&quot; (''A History of the Jews'', 1987, p.242) 
In his final sermon shortly before his death, however, Luther preached &quot;We want to treat them with Christian love and to pray for them, so that they might become converted and would receive the Lord&quot; (Weimar edition, Vol. 51, p. 195).  Still, Luther's harsh comments about the Jews are seen by many as a continuation of medieval Christian anti-Semitism.

===Anti-Semitism in 19th and 20th century Catholicism===
Throughout the 19th century and into the 20th, the Catholic Church still incorporated strong anti-Semitic elements, despite increasing attempts to separate anti-Judaism, the opposition to the Jewish religion on religious grounds, and racial anti-Semitism.  [[Pope Pius VII]] (1800-1823) had the walls of the Jewish [[Ghetto]] in Rome rebuilt after the Jews were [[Napoleon and the Jews|released by Napoleon]], and Jews were restricted to the Ghetto through the end of the papacy of [[Pope Pius IX]] (1846-1878), the last Pope to rule Rome. Additionally, official organizations such as the Jesuits banned candidates &quot;who are descended from the Jewish race unless it is clear that their father, grandfather, and great-grandfather have belonged to the Catholic Church&quot; until 1946.  Brown University historian [[David Kertzer]], working from the Vatican archive, has further argued in his book ''The Popes Against the Jews'' that in the 19th and 20th century the [[Roman Catholic Church]] adhered to a distinction between &quot;good anti-Semitism&quot; and &quot;bad anti-Semitism&quot;. The &quot;bad&quot; kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The &quot;good&quot; kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc. Many Catholic bishops wrote articles criticizing Jews on such grounds, and, when accused of promoting hatred of Jews, would remind people that they condemned the &quot;bad&quot; kind of anti-Semitism.  Kertzer's work is not, therefore, without critics; scholar of Jewish-Christian relations [[Rabbi David G. Dalin]], for example, criticized Kertzer in the [[Weekly Standard]] for using evidence selectively.  The [[Second Vatican Council]], the [[Nostra Aetate]] document, and the efforts of [[Pope John Paul II]] have helped reconcile Jews and Catholicism in recent decades, however.

=== Passion plays ===
[[Passion play]]s, dramatic stagings representing the trial and death of [[Jesus]], have historically been used in remembrance of Jesus' death during [[Lent]]. These plays historically blamed the Jews for [[deicide|the death of Jesus]] in a [[polemic]]al fashion, depicting a crowd of Jewish people condemning Jesus to [[crucifixion]] and a Jewish leader assuming eternal collective guilt for the crowd for the murder of Jesus, which, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' explains, &quot;for centuries prompted vicious attacks -- or [[pogrom]]s -- on Europe's Jewish communities&quot;.[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/04/10/in_poland_new_passion_plays_on_old_hatreds/] [[Time Magazine]] in its article ''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101030901-477956,00.html The Problem With Passion]'' explains that &quot;such passages (are) highly subject to interpretation&quot;.  Although modern scholars interpret the &quot;blood on our children&quot; (Matthew 27: 25) as &quot;a specific group's oath of responsibility&quot; some audiences have historically interpreted it as &quot;an assumption of eternal, racial guilt&quot;. This last interpretation has often incited violence against Jews; according to the [[Anti-Defamation League]], &quot;Passion plays historically unleashed the torrents of hatred aimed at the Jews, who always were depicted as being in partnership with the devil and the reason for Jesus' death&quot;.[http://www.adl.org/ADL_Opinions/Interfaith/oped_2004012_pbp.htm] The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', in its article ''[http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0710/p11s01-lire.html?entryBottomStory Capturing the Passion]'' explains that &quot;[h]istorically, productions have reflected negative images of Jews and the long-time church teaching that the Jewish people were collectively responsible for Jesus' death. Violence against Jews as 'Christ-killers' often flared in their wake.&quot; ''[[Christianity Today]]''  in ''[http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/newsletter/2004/feb20.html Why some Jews fear (Mel Gibson's) The Passion (of the Christ)]'' observed that &quot;Outbreaks of Christian anti-Semitism related to the Passion narrative have been...numerous and destructive.&quot;

In 2003 and 2004 some compared [[Mel Gibson]]'s recent film ''The Passion of the Christ'' to these kinds of passion plays, but this characterization is hotly disputed; an analysis of that topic is in the article on [[The Passion of the Christ]].  Despite such fears, there have been no publicized anti-Semitic incidents directly attributable to the movie's influence.

==Racial anti-Semitism ==
Racial anti-Semitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipation of the Jews]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility.  With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious anti-Semitism, a combination of growing nationalism, the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist anti-Semitism.

===Nationalism and Anti-Semitism===
Racial anti-Semitism was preceded, especially in Germany, by anti-Semitism arising from [[Romantic]] [[nationalism]]. As racial theories developed, especially from the mid nineteenth-century onwards, these nationalist ideas were subsumed within them. But their origins were quite distinct from racialism. On the one hand they derived from an exclusivist interpretation of the 'Volk' ideas of [[Herder]]. This led to anti-Semitic writing and journalism in the second quarter of the 19th century of which [[Richard Wagner]]'s  [[Das Judentum in der Musik]] (Jewry in Music) is perhaps the most notorious example. On the other hand, radical socialists such as [[Karl Marx]] identified Jews as being both victims and enforced perpetrators of the [[Capitalist]] system - e.g. in his article 'On the Jewish Question'. From sources such as these, and encouraged by the broad acceptance of racial theories as the century continued, anti-Semitism entered the vocabularies and policies of both the right and the left in political thought.

===The rise of racial anti-Semitism===
Modern European anti-Semitism has its origin in 19th century [[pseudo-science|pseudo-scientific]] theories that the Jewish people are a sub-group of Semitic peoples; Semitic people were thought by many Europeans to be entirely different from the [[Aryan]], or [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]], populations, and that they can never be amalgamated with them. In this view, Jews are not opposed on account of their [[religion]], but on account of their supposed hereditary or genetic [[racial characteristics]]: greed, a special aptitude for money-making, aversion to hard work, clannishness and obtrusiveness, lack of social tact, low cunning, and especially lack of [[patriotism]].

While enlightened European intellectual society of that period viewed prejudice against people on account of their religion to be declassé and a sign of ignorance, because of this supposed 'scientific' connection to [[genetics]] they felt fully justified in prejudice based on nationality or 'race'. In order to differentiate between the two practices, the term anti-Semitism was developed to refer to this 'acceptable' bias against Jews as a nationality, as distinct from the 'undesirable' prejudice against Judaism as a religion. Concurrently with this usage, [[Definitions of Palestine#Referring to Jews in a national rather than religious sense|some authors in Germany]] began to use the term 'Palestinians' when referring to Jews as a people, rather than as a religious group.

As further proof of its pseudo-scientific nature, it is questionable whether [[Jew]]s in general looked significantly different from the populations conducting &quot;racial&quot; anti-Semitism.  This was especially true in places like [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Austria]] where the Jewish population tended to be more secular (or at least less Orthodox) than that of Eastern Europe, and did not wear clothing (such as a [[yarmulke]]) that would particularly distinguish their appearance from the non-Jewish population.  Many anthropologists of the time such as [[Franz Boas]] tried to use complex physical measurements like the [[cephalic index]] and visual surveys of hair/eye color and skin tone of Jewish vs. non-Jewish European populations to prove that the notion of a separate &quot;Jewish race&quot; was a myth.  The 19th and early 20th century view of race should be distinguished from the efforts of modern population genetics to trace the ancestry of various Jewish groups, see [[Y-chromosomal Aaron]].

The advent of racial anti-Semitism was also linked to the growing sense of [[nationalism]] in many countries.  The nationalist context viewed Jews as a separate and often &quot;alien&quot; nation within the countries in which Jews resided, a prejudice exploited by the elites of many governments.

===Elites and the use of Anti-semitism===
[[Image:1889 French elections Poster for antisemitic candidate Adolf Willette.jpg|thumb|250px|1889 Paris, France elections poster for self-described &quot;candidat antisémite&quot; [[Adolphe Willette]]: &quot;The Jews are a different race, hostile to our own... Judaism, there is the enemy!&quot;]]
Many analysts of modern anti-Semitism have pointed out that its essence is [[scapegoat]]ing: features of modernity felt by some group to be undesirable (e.g. materialism, the power of money, economic fluctuations, war, secularism, socialism, Communism, movements for racial equality, social welfare policies, etc.) are believed to be caused by the machinations of a conspiratorial people whose full loyalties are not to the national group.  Traditionalists anguished at the supposedly decadent or defective nature of the modern world have sometimes been inclined to embrace such views.  Indeed, it is a matter of historical record that many of the conservative members of the [[WASP]] establishment of the [[United States]] as well as other comparable Western elites (e.g. the [[British Foreign Office]]) have harbored such attitudes, and in the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], some xenophobic anti-Semites have imagined world [[Communism]] to be a Jewish conspiracy (''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' [1980], p. 590).

The modern form of anti-Semitism is identified in the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 edition]] of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] as a conspiracy theory serving the self-understanding of the European [[aristocracy]], whose social power waned with the rise of bourgeois society. The Jews of Europe, then recently emancipated, were relatively literate, entrepreneurial and unentangled in aristocratic patronage systems, and were therefore disproportionately represented in the ascendant [[bourgeois]] class. As the [[aristocracy]] (and its hangers-on) lost out to this new center of power in society, they found their scapegoat - exemplified in the work of [[Arthur de Gobineau]]. That the Jews were singled out to embody the 'problem' was, by this theory, no more than a symptom of the [[nobility]]'s own prejudices concerning the importance of breeding (on which its own [[legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]] was founded).

===Dreyfus Affair===
[[Image:Degradation alfred dreyfus.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The treason conviction of [[Alfred Dreyfus]] demonstrated French anti-semitism.]]
The [[Dreyfus affair]] was a political scandal which divided [[France]] for many years during the late 19th century. It centered on the 1894 treason conviction of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish officer in the French army.  Dreyfus was, in fact, innocent: the conviction rested on false documents, and when high-ranking officers realized this they attempted to cover up the mistakes.  The writer [[Émile Zola]] exposed the affair to the general public in the literary newspaper ''L'Aurore'' (The Dawn) in a famous open letter to the [[President of France|Président de la République]] [[Félix Faure]], titled ''J'accuse !'' (I Accuse!) on  January 13, 1898.

The Dreyfus Affair split France between the ''Dreyfusards'' (those supporting Alfred Dreyfus) and the ''Antidreyfusards'' (those against him). The quarrel was especially violent since it involved many issues then highly [[controversial]] in a heated political climate.

Dreyfus was pardoned in 1899, readmitted into the army, and made a knight in the [[Légion d'Honneur|Legion of Honour]]. An Austrian Jewish journalist named [[Theodor Herzl]] was assigned to report on the trial and its aftermath. The injustice of the trial and the anti-Semitic passions it aroused in France and elsewhere turned him into a determined and leading [[Zionism|Zionist]]; ultimately turning the movement into an international one.  Also see [[Alfred Dreyfus]] and [[Dreyfus affair]].

===Pogroms===
[[Image:Ekaterinoslav1905.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The victims, mostly Jewish children, of a 1905 [[pogrom]] in [[Dnipropetrovsk]].]]
[[Pogrom]]s were a form of race riots, most commonly Russia and Eastern Europe, aimed specifically at Jews and often government sponsored.  Pogroms became endemic during a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots that swept southern [[Russia]] in 1881, after Jews were wrongly blamed for the assassination of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. In the 1881 outbreak, thousands of Jewish homes were destroyed, many families reduced to extremes of poverty; women sexually assaulted, and large numbers of men, women, and children killed or injured in 166 Russian towns.  The new czar, [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], blamed the Jews for the riots and issued a [[May Laws|series of harsh restrictions]] on Jews. Large numbers of pogroms continued until 1884, with at least tacit inactivity by the authorities. An even bloodier wave of pogroms broke out in 1903-1906, leaving an estimated 2,000 Jews dead, and many more wounded. A final large wave of 887 pogroms in Russia and Ukraine occurred during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], in which between 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews were killed by riots led by various sides.

During the early to mid-1900s, pogroms also occurred in Poland, Argentina, and throughout the Arab world.  Extremely deadly pogroms also occurred during [[World War II]], including the Romanian [[Iaşi pogrom]] in which 14,000 Jews were killed, and the [[Jedwabne massacre]] in Poland which killed between 380 and 1,600 Jews. The last mass pogrom in Europe was the post-war [[Kielce pogrom]] of 1946.

===Anti-Jewish Legislation===
[[Image:Nurembergracechart.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935 used a pseudo-scientific basis for racial discrimination against Jews. People with four German grandparents (white circles) were of &quot;German blood,&quot; while people were classified as Jews if they descended from three or more Jewish grandparents (black circles in top row right). One or more Jewish grandparents made someone &quot;mixed blood.&quot;  Since the racial differences between Jews and Germans are small, the Nazis used the religious observance of a person's grandparents to determine their &quot;race.&quot; (1935 Chart from [[Nazi Germany]] used to explain the [[Nuremberg Laws]])]]

Anti-semitism was officially adopted by the German Conservative Party at the [[Tivoli Congress]] in 1892, on the instigation of Dr. Klasing but in the teeth of opposition led by the moderate Werner [[von Blumenthal]].

Official [[anti-Semitic]] legislation was enacted in various countries, especially in Imperial Russia in the 19th century and in [[Nazi]] Germany and its Central European allies in the 1930s. These laws were passed against Jews as a group, regardless of their religious affiliation - in some cases, such as Nazi Germany, having a Jewish grandparent was enough to qualify someone as Jewish.

In Germany, for example, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935 prevented marriage between any Jew and non-Jew, and made it that all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews, were no longer citizens of their own country (their official title became &quot;[[subject of the state]]&quot;). This meant that they had no basic citizens' rights, e.g., to vote.  In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them having any influence in education, politics, higher education and industry.  On 15 November of 1938, Jewish children were banned from going to normal schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been persuaded to sell out to the Nazi government. This further reduced their rights as human beings; they were in many ways officially separated from the German populace.  Similar laws existed in [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and [[Austria]].

Even when anti-Semitism was not an official state policy, governments in the early to middle parts of the 20th century often adopted more subtle measures aimed at Jews.  For example, the [[Evian Conference]] of 1938 delegates from thirty-two countries neither condemned Hitler's treatment of the Jews nor allowed more Jewish refugees to flee to the West.

===The Holocaust and Holocaust Denial===
{{main|Holocaust}}
Racial anti-Semitism reached its most horrific manifestation in the [[Holocaust]] during [[World War II]], in which about 6 million [[Europe]]an [[Jew]]s, 1.5 million of them children, were systematically murdered.

[[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] often claim that &quot;the Jews&quot; or &quot;[[conspiracy theory|Zionist conspiracy]]&quot; are responsible for the exaggeration or wholesale fabrication of the events of the Holocaust. Critics of such revisionism point to an overwhelming amount of physical and historical evidence that supports the mainstream historical view of the Holocaust. Almost all academics agree that there is no evidence for any such conspiracy.

===Anti-Semitic conspiracy theories===
[[Image:Protocols of the Elders of Zion 2005 Syria al-Awael.jpg|thumb|2005 [[Syria]]n edition of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' includes a &quot;historical and contemporary investigative study&quot; that repeats the [[blood libel against Jews|blood libel]] and other anti-Semitic accusations, and argues that the Torah and Talmud encourage Jews &quot;to commit treason and to conspire, dominate, be arrogant and exploit other countries&quot;.]]
The rise of views of the Jews as a malevolent &quot;race&quot; generated anti-Semitic [[conspiracy theories]] that the Jews, as a group, were plotting to control or otherwise influence the world.  From the early infamous Russian literary [[hoax]], [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], published by the Tzar's secret police, a key element of anti-Semitic thought has been that Jews influence or control the world.

In a recent incarnation, extremist groups, such as [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] parties and [[Islamism|Islamist]] groups, claim that the aim of [[Zionism]] is [[global domination]]; they call this the ''Zionist [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]]'' and use it to support anti-Semitism. This position is associated with [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]], though increasingly, it is becoming a tendency within parts of the [[Left wing politics|left]] as well.

== Anti-Semitism and the Muslim world ==
''Anti-Semitism within Islam is discussed in the article on [[Islam and anti-Semitism]]. Anti-Semitism in the Arab World is discussed in the article on [[Arabs and anti-Semitism]]'' 

The [[Qur'an]], [[Islam]]'s holy book, accuses the [[Jew]]s of corrupting the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Muslims refer to Jews and [[Christian]]s as a &quot;[[People of the book]]&quot;; Islamic law demands that when under Muslim rule they should be treated as [[dhimmi|dhimmis]] - from the Arab term ''ahl adh-dhimma''. The writer [[Bat Ye'or]] introduced the modern word ''Dhimmitude'' as a generic indication of this Islamic attitude. Dhimmis were granted protection of life (including against other Muslim states), the right to residence, worship, and work or trade, and were exempted from military service, and Muslim religious duties, personal law and tax. They were obligated to pay other taxes ([[jizyah]] and land tax), and subject to various other restrictions regarding the contradiction of Islam, the Qur'an or [[Muhammad]], [[proselyte|proselytizing]], and at times a number of other restrictions on dress, riding horses or camels, carrying arms, holding public office, building or repairing places of worship, mourning loudly, wearing shoes outside a Jewish ghetto, etc.

Anti-Semitism in the [[Islamic world|Muslim world]] increased in the [[twentieth century]], as anti-Semitic motives and [[blood libel]]s were imported from [[Europe]] and as resentment against [[Zionism|Zionist]] efforts in [[British Mandate of Palestine]] spread. While anti-Semitism has certainly been heightened by the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], there were an increasing number of [[pogrom]]s against Jews prior to the foundation of [[Israel]], including [[Nazi]]-inspired pogroms in [[Algeria]] in the 1930s, and massive attacks on the Jews in [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] in the 1940s (see [[Farhud]]). George Gruen attributes the increased animosity towards Jews in the [[Arab world]] to several factors including: The breakdown of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and traditional [[Islamic]] society; domination by Western [[colonialism|colonial powers]] under which Jews gained a disproportionatly large role in the commercial, professional, and administrative life of the region; the rise of [[Arab nationalism]], whose proponents sought the wealth and positions of local Jews through government channels; resentment over Jewish [[nationalism]] and the Zionist movement; and the readiness of unpopular [[regime]]s to [[scapegoat]] local Jews for political purposes.[http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl102.htm]

[[Anti-Zionism|Anti-Zionist]] [[propaganda]] in the [[Middle East]] frequently adopts the terminology and symbols of [[the Holocaust]] to [[Demonization|demonize]] Israel and its leaders.  At the same time, [[Holocaust denial]] and Holocaust minimization efforts have found increasingly overt acceptance as sanctioned historical discourse in a number of Middle Eastern countries.

== Anti-semitism and specific countries ==
=== United States ===
[[Image:KKK holocaust a zionist hoax.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]]: Nazi salute and Holocaust denial]]
{{main|History of the Jews in the United States}}
Jews were often condemned by [[populist]] politicians alternately for their left-wing politics, or their perceived wealth, at the turn of the century. Anti-semitism grew in the years leading up to America's entry into World War II, Father [[Charles Coughlin]], an anti-Semitic radio preacher, as well as many other prominent public figures, condemned &quot;the Jews,&quot; and [[Henry Ford]] reprinted [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] in his newspaper.

In 1939 a [[Roper]] poll found that only thirty-nine percent of Americans felt that Jews should be treated like other people. Fifty-three percent believed that &quot;Jews are different and should be restricted&quot; and ten percent believed that Jews should be deported. [http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch22.htm]
It has been estimated that 190 000 - 200 000 Jews could have been saved during the [[Second World War]] had it not been 
for bureaucratic obstacles to immigration deliberately created by [[Breckinridge Long]] and others.[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/peopleevents/pandeAMEX90.html]

Unofficial antisemitism was also widespread in the first half of the century.  For example, to limit the growing number of Jewish students between 1919-1950s a number of private liberal arts universities and medical and dental schools employed [[Numerus clausus#Numerus clausus in the United States|Numerus clausus]]. These included [[Harvard University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Cornell University]], and [[Boston University]]. In 1925 [[Yale University]], which already had such admissions preferences as &quot;character&quot;, &quot;solidity&quot;, and &quot;physical characteristics&quot; added a  program of [[legacy preference]] admission spots for children of Yale alumni, in an explicit attempt to put the brakes on the rising percentage of Jews in the student body. This was soon copied by other Ivy League and other schools, and admissions of Jews were kept down to 10% through the 1950s. Such policies were for the most part discarded during the early 1960s.

American anti-Semitism underwent a modest revival in the late 20th century. The [[Nation of Islam]] under [[Louis Farrakhan]] claimed that Jews were responsible for slavery, economic exploitation of black labor, selling alcohol and drugs in their communities, and unfair domination of the economy.  Jesse Jackson issued his infamous &quot;Hymietown&quot; remarks during the 1984 Presidential primary campaign.  
According to ADL surveys begun in 1964, African-Americans are &quot;significantly more likely&quot; than white Americans to hold anti-Semitic beliefs, although there is a strong correlation between education level and the rejection of anti-Semitic stereotypes. [http://www.adl.org/antisemitism_survey/survey_print.asp].

=== Europe ===
The summary of a 2004 poll by the ''Pew Global Attitudes Project'' noted that &quot;Despite concerns about rising anti-Semitism in Europe, there are no indications that anti-Jewish sentiment has increased over the past decade. Favorable ratings of Jews are actually higher now in France, Germany and Russia than they were in 1991. Nonetheless, Jews are better liked in the U.S. than in Germany and Russia.&quot;[http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=206]

However, according to 2005 survey results by the ADL [http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASInt_13/4726_13.htm], anti-Semitic attitudes remain common in Europe.  Over 30% of those surveyed indicated that Jews have too much power in business, with responses ranging from lows of 11% in Denmark and 14% in England to highs of 66% in Hungary, and over 40% in Poland and Spain.  The results of religious anti-Semitism also linger and over 20% of European respondents agreed that Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus, with France having the lowest percentage at 13% and Poland having the highest number of those agreeing, at 39%. [http://www.philosophistry.com/specials/europe/question_1.html] 

The Vienna-based European Union Monitoring Center (EUMC), for 2002 and 2003, identified France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and The Netherlands as EU member countries with notable increases in incidents. As these nations keep reliable and comprehensive statistics on anti-Semitic acts, and are engaged in combating anti-Semitism, their data was readily available to the EUMC. Governments and leading public figures condemned the violence, passed new legislation, and mounted positive law enforcement and educational efforts.

In Western Europe, traditional far-right groups still account for a significant proportion of the attacks against Jews and Jewish properties; disadvantaged and disaffected Muslim youths increasingly were responsible for most of the other incidents. In Eastern Europe, with a much smaller Muslim population, skinheads and others members of the radical political fringe were responsible for most anti-Semitic incidents. Anti-Semitism remained a serious problem in Russia and Belarus, and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, with most incidents carried out by ultra-nationalist and other far-right elements. The stereotype of Jews as manipulators of the global economy continues to provide fertile ground for anti-Semitic aggression. 

==== France ====
[[Image:FrenchCemetery103004-01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Defacement of a Jewish cemetery in France, 2004.]]
{{main|History of the Jews in France}}

Anti-semitism was particularly virulent in [[Vichy France]] during [[World War II|WWII]] (1939 - 1945). The Vichy government openly collaborated with the Nazi occupiers to identify Jews for deportation and transportation to the death camps. 

Today, despite a steady trend of decreasing antisemitism among the population[http://www.tns-sofres.com/etudes/pol/080605_antisemitisme_r.htm], acts of antisemitism are a serious cause for concern [http://www.lexpress.fr/info/societe/dossier/juifsfr/dossier.asp], as is tension between the Jewish and Muslim populations of France, both the largest in Europe. According to the National Advisory Committee on human rights, antisemitic acts account for a majority (72% of all in 2003) of racist acts in France.  (''See also the official statement of the French ministry of interior about antisemitic acts''[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/rubriques/a/a5_communiques/2005_07_25_antisemite].)

In 2005 the Israeli newspaper the [[Maariv]] found that 82% of French people questioned had favourable attitudes towards Jews, the second highest percentage of the countries questioned. The Netherlands was highest at 85%. [http://superfrenchie.com/?p=125#comments]

==== Poland ====
''see [[History of the Jews in Poland]]''

In 1264, King [[Boleslaus V of Poland]] legislated a charter for Jewish residence and protection, hoping that Jewish settlement would contribute to the development of the Polish economy.  This charter, which encouraged money-lending, was a slight variation of the 1244 charter granted by the King of [[Austria]] to the Jews. By the sixteenth century, Poland had become the center of European Jewry and the most tolerant of all European countries regarding the matters of faith, although there were still occasionally violent anti-Semitic incidents.

At the onset of the seventeenth century, however, the tolerance began to give way to increased anti-Semitism. Elected to the Polish throne King [[Sigismund III]] of the Swedish [[House of Vasa]], a strong supporter of the [[counter-reformation]], began to undermine the principles of the [[Warsaw Confederation]] and the religious tolerance in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], revoking and limiting privileges of all non-Catholic faiths. In 1628 he banned publication of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] books, including the [[Talmud]] [http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/staff/Polcen16c.html]. Acclaimed twentieth century historian [[Simon Dubnow]], in his ''[[magnum opus]]'' ''History of the Jews in Poland and Russia'', detailed: 
:&quot;''At the end of the 16th century and thereafter, not one year passed without a blood libel trial against Jews in Poland, trials which always ended with the execution of Jewish victims in a heinous manner...&quot;'' (ibid., volume 6, chapter 4). 

In the 1650s the Swedish invasion of the Commonwealth ([[The Deluge]]) and the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] of the [[Cossack]]s resulted in vast depopulation of the Commonwealth, as over 30% of the ~10 million population has perished or emigrated. In the related 1648-55 pogroms led by the Ukrainian [[Haidamak]]s uprising against Polish nobility ([[szlachta]]), during which approximately 100,000 Jews were slaughtered, Polish and [[Ruthenian]] peasants often participated in killing Jews (''The Jews in Poland'', Ken Spiro, 2001). The besieged szlachta, who were also decimated in the territories where the uprising happened, typically abandoned the loyal peasantry, townsfolk, and the Jews renting their land, in violation of &quot;rental&quot; contracts.

In the aftermath of the Deluge and Chmielnicki Uprising, many Jews fled to the less turbulent [[Netherlands]], which had granted the Jews a protective charter in 1619. From then until the [[Nazi]] deportations in 1942, the Netherlands remained a remarkably tolerant haven for Jews in Europe, excedeeing the tolerance extant in all other European countries at the time, and becoming one of the few Jewish havens until nineteenth century social and political reforms throughout much of Europe. Many Jews also fled to England, open to Jews since the mid-seventeenth century, in which Jews were fundamentally ignored and not typically persecuted.
Historian Berel Wein notes:
:&quot;''In a reversal of roles that is common in Jewish history, the victorious Poles now vented their wrath upon the hapless Jews of the area, accusing them of collaborating with the [[Cossack]] invader!... The Jews, reeling from almost five years of constant hell, abandoned their Polish communities and institutions...&quot;'' (''Triumph of Survival'', 1990).

Throughout the sixteenth to eighteenth century, many of the szlachta mistreated peasantry, townsfolk and Jews. Threat of mob violence was a specter over the Jewish communities in [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] at the time. On one occasion in 1696, a mob threatened to massacre the Jewish community of Posin, [[Vitebsk]]. The mob accused the Jews of murdering a Pole. At the last moment, a peasant woman emerged with the victim's clothes and confessed to the murder. One notable example of actualized riots against Polish Jews is the rioting of 1716, during which many Jews lost their lives. Later, in 1723, the Bishop of [[Gdańsk]] instigated the massacre of hundreds of Jews. 

The legendary [[Abraham ben Abraham|Walentyn Potocki]], a Polish nobleman who converted to Judaism, is said to have been burned by [[auto da fe]] on May 24, 1749. In 1757, at the instigation of [[Jacob Frank]] and his followers, the Bishop of [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]] forced the Jewish rabbis to participate in a religious dispute with the quasi-Christian Frankists. Among the other charges, the Frankists claimed that the [[Talmud]] was full of heresy against Catholicism. The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] judges determined that the Frankists had won the debate, whereupon the Bishop levied heavy fines against the Jewish community and confiscated and burned all Jewish Talmuds. Polish anti-Semitism during the seventeenth and eighteenth century was summed up by Issac de Pinto as follows: &quot;''Polish Jews... who are deprived of all the privileges of society... who are despised and reviled on all sides, who are often persecuted, always insulted.... That contempt which is heaped on them chokes up all the seeds of virtue and honour....''&quot; ([[Issac de Pinto]], philosopher and economist, in a 1762 letter to [[Voltaire]]). 

On the other hand, it should be noted that despite the mentioned incidents, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was a relative haven for Jews when compared to the period of the [[partitions of Poland]] and the PLC's destruction in 1795 (see [[Anti-Semitism#Russia and the Soviet Union|Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union]], below).

Anti-Jewish sentiments continued to be present in Poland, even after the country regained its independence. One notable manifestation of these attitudes includes [[Numerus clausus#numerus clausus in Poland|numerus clausus]] rules imposed, by almost all Polish universities in the 1930's.  [[William W. Hagen]] in his ''Before the &quot;Final Solution&quot;: Toward a Comparative Analysis of Political Anti-Semitism in Interwar Germany and Poland'' article in ''Journal of Modern History (July, 1996): 1-31'', details:
:&quot;''In Poland, the semidictatorial government of [[Pilsudski]] and his successors, pressured by an increasingly vocal opposition on the radical and fascist right, implemented many anti-Semitic policies tending in a similar direction, while still others were on the official and semiofficial agenda when war descended in 1939.... In the 1930s the realm of official and semiofficial discrimination expanded to encompass limits on Jewish export firms... and, increasingly, on university admission itself. In 1921-22 some 25 percent of Polish university students were Jewish, but in 1938-39 their proportion had fallen to 8 percent.''&quot; 

While there are many examples of Polish support and help for the Jews during World War II and the Holocaust, there are also numerous examples of anti-Semitic incidents, and the Jewish population was certain of the indifference towards their fate from the Christian Poles. The Polish Institute for National Memory identified twenty-four [[pogroms]] against Jews during World War II, the largest occurring at the village of [[Jedwabne]] in 1941 (see [[massacre in Jedwabne]]).

After the end of World War II the remaining anti-Jewish sentiments were skillfully used at certain moments by communist party or individual politicians in order to achieve their assumed political goals, which pinnacled in the [[March 1968 events]]. These sentiments started to diminish only with the collapse of the [[communist]] rule in Poland in 1989, which has resulted in a re-examination of events between Jewish and Christian Poles, with a number of incidents, like the masscre at Jedwabne, being discussed openly for the first time. Violent anti-semitism in Poland in 21st century is marginal[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/graph-7.jpg] compared to elsewhere, but there are very few Jews remaining in Poland. Still, according to recent (June 7, 2005) results of research by [[B'nai Brith]]s [[Anti-Defamation League]], Poland remains among the European countries (with others being Italy, Spain and Germany) with the largest percentages of people holding anti-Semitic views.

Poland is actively trying to address concerns about anti-semitism.  In 2004, the Polish government approved a National Action Program against racism, including anti-semitism. Additionally the Polish Catholic Church has widely distributed materials promoting the need for respect and cooperation with Judaism.

==== Germany ====
[[Image:dstsatan.jpeg|thumb|200px|Der St&amp;uuml;rmer: &quot;Satan&quot;. The caption reads: &quot;The Jews are our misfortune.&quot;]]
''See main articles: [[History of the Jews in Germany]], [[Holocaust]]''

From the early Middle Ages to the 18th century, the Jews in Germany were subject to many persecutions as well as brief times of tolerance.  Though the 19th century began with a series of riots and pogroms against the Jews, [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] followed in 1848, so that, by the early 20th century, the Jews of Germany were the most integrated in Europe.  The situation changed in the early 1930's with the rise of the [[Nazi]]s and their explicity anti-Semitic program. [[Hate speech]] which referred to [[Jew]]ish citizens as &quot;dirty Jews&quot; became common in anti-Semitic pamphlets and [[newspaper]]s such as the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' and ''[[Der Stürmer]]''. Additionally, blame was laid on German Jews for having caused Germany's defeat in [[World War I]] (see ''[[Dolchstosslegende]]'').
[[Image:Der Giftpilz - Gott des Juden - Nazi propaganda.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Nazi propaganda for German children from [[Julius Streicher]]'s publication [http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/thumb.htm ''Der Giftpilz'' (Toadstool)], 1938. The caption reads: &quot;The God of the Jew is Money. And to gain money, he will commit the greatest crimes….&quot;]]

Anti-Jewish propaganda expanded rapidly.  Nazi cartoons depicting &quot;dirty Jews&quot; frequently portrayed a dirty, physically unattractive and badly dressed &quot;talmudic&quot; Jew in traditional religious garments similar to those worn by [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]]. Articles attacking Jewish Germans, while concentrating on commercial and political activities of prominent Jewish individuals, also frequently attacked them based on religious dogmas, such as [[blood libel]].

The Nazi anti-Semitic program quickly expanded beyond mere speech.  Starting in 1933, repressive laws were passed against Jews, culminating in the [[Nuremberg Laws]] which removed most of the rights of citizenship from Jews, using a racial definition based on descent, rather than any religious definition of who was a Jew.  Sporadic violence against the Jews became widespread with the [[Kristallnacht]] riots, which targeted Jewish homes, businesses and places of worship, killing hundreds across Germany and Austria.

The anti-Semitic agenda culminated in the [[genocide]] of the Jews of Europe, known as the [[Holocaust]].

==== Russia and the Soviet Union ====
[[Image:Iudaism bez prikras 63-7.gif|right|thumb|&quot;Judaism Without Embellishments&quot; by Trofim Kichko, published by the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR in 1963: &quot;It is in the teachings of Judaism, in the Old Testament, and in the Talmud, that the Israeli militarists find inspiration for their inhuman deeds, racist theories, and expansionist designs...&quot;]]
''Main articles: [[History of the Jews in Russia and Soviet Union]], [[Pogrom]]''

The [[Pale of Settlement]] was the Western region of [[Imperial Russia]] to which Jews were restricted by the Tsarist [[Ukase]] of 1792. It consisted of the territories of former [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], annexed with the existing numerous Jewish population, and the [[Crimea]] (which was later cut out from the Pale). 

During 1881-1884, 1903-1906 and 1914-1921, waves of anti-Semitic [[pogrom]]s swept Russian Jewish communities. At least some pogroms are believed to have been organized or supported by the Russian [[okhranka]]; although there is no hard evidence for this, the Russian police and army generally displayed indifference to the pogroms (e.g. during the three-day [[Kishinev pogrom|First Kishinev pogrom]] of 1903), as well as to anti-Jewish articles in newspapers which often instigated the pogroms.

During this period the [[May Laws]] policy was also put into effect, banning Jews from rural areas and towns, and placing strict quotas on the number of Jews allowed into higher education and many professions. The combination of the repressive legislation and pogroms propelled mass Jewish emigration, and by 1920 more than two million Russian Jews had emigrated, most to the [[United States]] while some made [[aliya]] to the [[Land of Israel]].

One of the most infamous anti-Semitic tractates was the Russian okhranka literary [[hoax]], ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', created in order to blame the Jews for Russia's problems during the period of revolutionary activity. 

Even though many [[Old Bolsheviks]] were ethnically Jewish, they sought to uproot Judaism and Zionism and established the [[Yevsektsiya]] to achieve this goal. By the end of the 1940s the Communist leadership of the former USSR had liquidated almost all Jewish organizations, including Yevsektsiya. 

The anti-Semitic campaign of 1948-1953 against so-called &quot;[[rootless cosmopolitans]],&quot; destruction of the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]], the fabrication of the &quot;[[Doctors' plot]],&quot; the rise of &quot;[[Zionology]]&quot; and subsequent activities of official organizations such as the [[Anti-Zionist committee of the Soviet public]] were officially carried out under the banner of &quot;anti-Zionism,&quot; but the use of this term could not obscure the anti-Semitic content of these campaigns, and by the mid-1950s the state persecution of Soviet Jews emerged as a major human rights issue in the West and domestically. See also: [[Jackson-Vanik amendment]], [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|Refusenik]], [[Pamyat]].

Today, anti-Semitic pronouncements, speeches and articles are common in Russia, and there are a large number of anti-Semitic neo-Nazi groups in the republics of the former Soviet Union, leading Pravda to declare in 2002 that &quot;Anti-semitism is booming in Russia&quot;[http://english.pravda.ru/main/2002/07/30/33489.html]. Over the past few years there have also been bombs attached to anti-Semitic signs, apparently aimed at Jews, and other violent incidents, including stabbings, have been recorded.

Though the government of [[Vladimir Putin]] takes an official stand against anti-semitism, some political parties and groups are explicitly anti-Semitic, in spite of a Russian law (Art. 282) against fomenting racial, ethnic or religious hatred.  In 2005, a group of 15 [[Duma]] members demanded that Judaism and Jewish organizations be banned from Russia.  In June, 500 prominent Russians, including some 20 members of the nationalist ''Rodina'' party, demanded that the state prosecutor investigate ancient Jewish texts as &quot;anti-Russian&quot; and ban Judaism &amp;mdash; the investigation was actually launched, but halted amid international outcry.

=== Asia ===
==== Japan ====
{{main|Antisemitism in Japan}}
Originally Japan, with no Jewish population, had no anti-Semitism but Nazi ideology and propaganda left an influence on Japan during World War II, and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion were translated into Japanese.  Today, anti-Semitism and belief in Jewish manipulation of Japan and the world remains despite the lack of any Jewish community in Japan.  Books about Jewish conspiracies are best sellers. According to a 1988 survey, 8% of Japanese had read one of these books.

== Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism ==
[[Anti-Zionism]] is a term that has been used to describe several very different political and religious points of view (both historically and in current debates) all expressing some form of opposition to [[Zionism]]. A large variety of commentators - politicians, journalists, academics and others - believe that criticisms of Israel and Zionism are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and attribute this to anti-Semitism. In turn, critics of this view believe that associating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism is intended to stifle debate, deflect attention from valid criticism, and taint anyone opposed to Israeli actions and policies. This subject is discussed in the main article on [[Anti-Zionism]].

[[Image:Tishreen-Apr-30-2000.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Cartoon from the Syrian Arab daily newspaper Tishreen (Apr 30, 2000). Negative [[zoomorphism]] is commonly used in anti-Semitic discourse.]]

=== New anti-Semitism ===
{{main|New anti-Semitism}}
In recent years some scholars of history, psychology, religion and representatives of Jewish groups, have noted what they describe as the ''new anti-Semitism'', which uses the language of anti-Zionism and criticism against Israel to attack the Jews more broadly.

The European Commission on Racism and Intolerance formally defined some of the ways in which anti-Zionism may cross the line to anti-Semitism: &quot;Examples of the ways in which anti-Semitism manifests itself with regard to the State of Israel taking into account the overall context could include: Denying the Jewish people right to [[self-determination]], e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor; applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation; using the symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism (e.g. claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis; drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis; and holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the State of Israel.&quot;

== Anti-Semitism in the 21st century ==
According to the 2005 U.S. State Department Report on Global Anti-Semitism, anti-Semitism in Europe has increased significantly in recent years. Beginning in 2000, verbal attacks directed against Jews increased while incidents of vandalism (e.g. graffiti, fire bombings of Jewish schools, desecration of synagogues and cemeteries) surged. Physical assaults including beatings, stabbings and other violence against Jews in Europe increased markedly, in a number of cases resulting in serious injury and even death.

On [[January 1]], [[2006]], Britain's chief [[rabbi]], Sir [[Jonathan Sacks]], warned that what he called a &quot;[[tsunami]] of anti-Semitism&quot; was spreading globally. In an interview with BBC's [[Radio Four]], Sacks said that anti-Semitism was on the rise in Europe, and that a number of his rabbinical colleagues had been assaulted, synagogues desecrated, and Jewish schools burned to the ground in France. He also said that: &quot;People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because ... British Jews see themselves as British citizens. So it's that kind of feeling that you don't know what's going to happen next that's making ... some European Jewish communities uncomfortable.&quot; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,2763,1676509,00.html]

Much of the new European anti-Semitic violence can actually be seen as a spill over from the long running Israeli-Arab conflict since the majority of the perpetrators are from the large immigrant Arab communities in European cities.  According to ''The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism'', most of the current anti-Semitism comes from militant Islamist and Muslim groups, and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside. [http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/general-analysis.htm] 

Similarly, in the Middle East, anti-Zionist propaganda frequently adopts the terminology and symbols of the Holocaust to demonize Israel and its leaders. This rhetoric often crosses the line separating the legitimate criticism of Israel and its policies to become anti-Semitic vilification posing as legitimate political commentary. At the same time, Holocaust denial and Holocaust minimization efforts find increasingly overt acceptance as sanctioned historical discourse in a number of Middle Eastern countries.

The problem of anti-Semitism is not only significant in Europe and in the Middle East, but there are also worrying expressions of it elsewhere. For example, in Pakistan, a country without a Jewish community, anti-Semitic sentiment fanned by anti-Semitic articles in the press is widespread. This reflects the more recent phenomenon of anti-Semitism appearing in countries where historically or currently there are few or even no Jews.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Economy - overview:'''
This is a traditional [[Polynesia]]n economy in which more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is strongly linked to the [[United States|US]], with which American Samoa conducts the great bulk of its foreign trade. [[Tuna]] [[fishing]] and tuna processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the primary export. Transfers from the [[US Government]] add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism, a developing sector, may be held back by the current financial difficulties in East Asia.

[[Image:ac.kimbeazleynew.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Kim Beazley]] MP, Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the [[Australian Labor Party]]]]

The '''[[politics]] of [[Australia]]''' take place within the framework of [[democracy|parliamentary democracy]]. The government of Australia is a [[federation]], and Australians elect state and territory legislatures as well as a [[bicameral]] [[Parliament of Australia]] based on the [[Westminster System]]. 

At the national level, elections are held at least once every three years. The [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] can advise the Governor-General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time, but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods prescribed in the [[Australian Constitution|Constitution]]. The last general election was in [[October]] [[2004]]. The [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia]] consists of two [[bicameralism|chambers]]:
* The [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] has 150 members, elected for a three year term in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] with a system of alternative vote known as [[instant-runoff voting | preferential voting]]. 
* The [[Australian Senate|Senate]] has 76 members, elected through a preferential system in 12-seat state [[constituency|constituencies]] and two-seat territorial [[constituency|constituencies]] with a system of single non-transferable vote. Electors choose territorial senators for a three-year term. The state senators serve for a six-year term, with half of the seats renewed every three years. 

==Political parties and elections==
{{elect|List of political parties in Australia|Elections in Australia}}
{{Australian legislative election, 2004}}
More info: [[Australian legislative election, 2004]]''

Three political parties dominate Australian politics. Of these, two govern together in a [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]]:
*The [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] is a party of the centre-right which broadly represents business, the suburban middle classes and many rural people.
*Its junior coalition partner is the [[National Party of Australia]], formerly the Country Party and now known for electoral purposes as &quot;The Nationals&quot;, a [[conservative]] party which represents rural interests.
*The [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) is a [[Social democracy|social democratic]] party founded by the [[trade union]] movement and broadly represents the urban working class, although it increasingly has a base of middle class support. 

Minor parties include:
*The [[Australian Democrats]], a party of middle-class [[liberals]]
*The [[Australian Greens]], a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] and [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] party
*The [[Country Liberal Party]], a party which only represents the Northern Territory. It is part of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]]
*The [[Family First Party]], a party appealing to conservative [[Christianity|Christian]]s.

The proportional representation system allows these parties to win seats in the [[Australian Senate]] and in the state upper houses, but they have usually been unable to win seats in the House of Representatives (the Greens won a House seat at a [[2002]] [[by-election]], but lost it in the [[Australian legislative election, 2004|2004 general election]]).

The Liberal/National coalition came to power in the March [[1996]] election, ending 13 years of Labor government and making [[John Howard]] Prime Minister. He was subsequently re-elected in October [[1998]], November [[2001]] and October [[2004]]. The coalition now holds a comfortable majority in the House of Representatives. In the Senate, the Liberal/National coalition was in a minority until the [[Australian legislative election, 2004|2004 election]], but from July [[2005]] it has a working majority there. Until [[2004]], lacking a majority in the Senate, the Liberal/National coalition relied on negotiations with the smaller parties and independents to secure the passage of legislation. 

Since its election, Howard's conservative coalition has moved to reduce the government's fiscal deficit and the influence of [[Australian labour movement|organised labour]], placing more emphasis on [[Enterprise Bargaining Agreement|workplace-based collective bargaining]] for wages. The Howard government also accelerated the pace of privatisation of government-owned enterprises that began with the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] Labor government. During its first two terms, the government's most sweeping change was  the introduction of a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]]. With the re-election of the Howard government in 2004, several significant and controversial bills have been passed, due to the government's newly-acquired Senate majority. These major changes have included a [[Australian industrial relations legislation, 2005|radical revamp of industrial relations laws]], an introduction of [[voluntary student unionism]], and the full privatisation of telecommunications company [[Telstra]]. These changes have sparked major debate within Australia, forcing many critics to question whether the Howard government has lived up to its promise to use its Senate majority wisely.

The Howard government has reversed the foreign policy of its predecessor, placing renewed emphasis on relations with Australia's traditional allies, the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and downgrading support for the [[United Nations]] in favour of bilateralism. Both major parties support maintaining good relations with regional powers such as [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Indonesia]], although issues such as the independence of [[East Timor]] have sometimes made this difficult. Australia has become increasingly involved in the internal difficulties of its smaller neighbours, such as [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Fiji]] and [[Nauru]].

The [[list of political parties in Australia]] comprises the names and federal leaders of significant political parties as well as the names of other parties, including formerly significant parties.

==Administrative divisions==
In the [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]], elections are held at least once every four years (except in [[Queensland]], which has three-year terms). In [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], election dates are fixed by legislation. However, the other [[Premiers of the Australian states|state premiers]] and territory Chief Ministers have the same discretion in calling elections as the Prime Minister at the national level. (See ''Main articles: [[Australian electoral system]], [[Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories]]'').  

Regional or local government within each state is handled by [[Local Government Area]]s and unlike other equivalent forms of local government such as those of the [[United States]], have relatively little power compared to the state governments (See ''Main article: [[Local government in Australia]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AvicennaPersian.jpg|thumb|The works of Avicenna, the greatest of the medieval Islamic physicians, played a crucial role in the [[European Renaissance]].]]
'''Abū ‘Alī al-Ḥusayn ibn ‘Abd Allāh ibn Sīnā''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''أبو علي الحسين بن عبد الله بن سينا''') often refered to by his [[Latinized]] name '''Avicenna''' was a [[Persian]] [[Muslim]] [[physician]], [[philosopher]], and [[scientist]] who was born in [[980]] in [[Kharmaithen]] near [[Bukhara]], now in [[Uzbekistan]] (then [[Iran]]), and died June [[1037]] in [[Hamadan]], [[Iran]].

He was the [[author]] of 450 books on a wide range of subjects. Many of these concentrated on [[philosophy]] and [[medicine]]. He is considered by many to be &quot;the father of modern medicine.&quot; [[George Sarton]] called Ibn Sina &quot;the most famous scientist of [[Islam]] and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times.&quot; His most famous works are ''[[The Book of Healing]]'' and ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', also known as the ''Qanun'' (full title: ''al-qanun fil-tibb'').

==Early life==
His life is known to us from authoritative sources. An autobiography covers his first thirty years, and the rest are documented by his disciple al-Juzajani, who was also his secretary and his friend.

He was born in 370 (AH) / 980 (AD) in Afshana, his mother's home, a small city now part of [[Uzbekistan]] (then part of the Islamic [[Caliphate]]) and his Father from [[Balkh]] now part of [[Afghanistan]] (then also part of the Islamic [[Caliphate]]). His native language was Persian. His father, an official of the Samanid administration, had him very carefully educated at Bukhara. Although traditionally influenced by the [[Ismaili]] branch of Islam, his independent thought was served by an extraordinary intelligence and memory, which allowed him to overtake his teachers at the age of fourteen. 

[[Ibn Sina]] was put under the charge of a tutor, and his precocity soon made him the marvel of his neighbours; he displayed exceptional [[intellect]]ual behaviour and was a [[Child prodigy|child prodigy]] who had memorized the [[Koran]] by the age of 10 and a great deal of [[Arabic poetry]] as well.  From a greengrocer he learned [[arithmetic]], and he began to learn more from a wandering scholar who gained a livelihood by curing the sick and teaching the young.  

However he was greatly troubled by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] problems and in particular the works of [[Aristotle]]. So, for the next year and a half, he also studied [[philosophy]], in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions, then go to the [[mosque]], and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night he would continue his studies, stimulating his senses by occasional cups of goat's milk, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the ''Metaphysics'' of [[Aristotle]], till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by [[Farabi]], which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhems. So great was his joy at the discovery, thus made by help of a work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed alms upon the poor. 

He turned to [[medicine]] at 16, and not only learned medical theory, but by gratuitous attendance on the sick had, according to his own account, discovered new methods of [[treatment]]. The teenager achieved full status as a physician at age 18 and found that &quot;Medicine is no hard and thorny science, like [[mathematics]] and [[metaphysics]], so I soon made great progress; I became an excellent doctor and began to treat patients, using approved remedies.&quot; The youthful physician's fame spread quickly, and he treated many patients without asking for payment. 

His first appointment was that of physician to the [[emir]], who owed him his recovery from a dangerous illness ([[997]]). Ibn Sina's chief reward for this service was access to the royal [[library]] of the [[Samanids]], well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Ibn Sina accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labours, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.

When Ibn Sina was 22 years old, he lost his father. The [[Samanid dynasty]] came to its end in December [[1004]]. Ibn Sina seems to have declined the offers of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], and Ibn Sina proceeded westwards to [[Urgench]] in the modern [[Uzbekistan]], where the [[vizier]], regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of [[Nishapur]] and [[Merv]] to the borders of [[Khorasan]], seeking an opening for his talents. [[Shams al-Ma'äli Qäbtis]], the generous ruler of [[Dailam]], himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find an asylum, was about that date ([[1052]]) starved to death by his own revolted soldiery. Ibn Sina himself was at this season stricken down by a severe illness. Finally, at [[Gorgan]], near the [[Caspian Sea]], Ibn Sina met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Ibn Sina lectured on [[logic]] and [[astronomy]]. For this patron, several of Ibn Sina's treatises were written; and the commencement of his ''Canon of Medicine'' also dates from his stay in [[Hyrcania]].

[[image:Avicenna2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Poland commemorated Avicenna's life and work in this postage stamp]]

Ibn Sina subsequently settled at [[Ray, Iran|Rai]], in the vicinity of the modern [[Tehran]], (present day capital of Iran), the home town of [[Rhazes]]; where [[Majd Addaula]], a son of the last [[emir]], was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ([[Seyyedeh Khatun]]). At Rai about thirty of his shorter works are said to have been composed. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, [[Amir Shamsud-Dawala]], compelling the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at [[Qazvin]], he passed southwards to Hamadãn, where that prince had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The amir consented that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in a [[shaikh|sheikh]]'s house, till a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina prosecuted his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the ''Canon'' and the ''Sanatio'', were dictated and explained to his pupils; among whom, when the lesson was over, he spent the rest of the night in festive enjoyment with a band of singers and players. On the death of the amir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an [[apothecary]], where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works. 

Meanwhile, he had written to [[Abu Ya'far]], the [[prefect]] of the dynamic city of [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], offering his services. The new emir of Hamadan, hearing of this correspondence and discovering where Ibn Sina's was hidden, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and Hamadãn; in [[1024]] the former captured Hamadan and its towns, expelling the Turkish [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. When the storm had passed, Ibn Sina returned with the amir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labours. Later, however, accompanied by his brother, a favourite pupil, and two slaves, Ibn Sina escaped out of the city in the dress of a [[Sufi|Sufite]] [[ascetic]]. After a perilous journey, they reached Isfahan, receiving an honourable welcome from the prince. Avicenna also introduced medical herbs.

==Late life==
The remaining ten or twelve years of Avicenna's life were spent in the service of [[Abu Ya'far 'Ala Addaula]], whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.  

During these years he began to study [[literature|literary]] matters and [[philology]], instigated, it is asserted, by criticisms on his style. But amid his restless study Ibn Sina never forgot his love of enjoyment. Unusual bodily vigour enabled him to combine severe devotion to work with facile indulgence in sensual pleasures. Versatile, lighthearted, boastful and pleasure-loving, he contrasts with the nobler and more intellectual character of [[Averroes]]. His bouts of pleasure gradually weakened his constitution; a severe [[colic]], which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadãn, was checked by remedies so violent that Ibn Sina could scarcely stand. On a similar occasion the disease returned; with difficulty he reached Hamadãn, where, finding the disease gaining ground, he refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned himself to his fate. 

His friends advised him to slow down and take life moderately. He refused, however, stating that: ''&quot;I prefer a short life with width to a narrow one with length&quot;''.  On his deathbed remorse seized him; he bestowed his goods on the poor, restored unjust gains, freed his slaves, and every third day till his death listened to the reading of the Qur'an. He died in June [[1037]], in his fifty-eighth year, and was buried in [[Hamedan]], [[Iran]].

==Works==
Ibn Sina is comparable to such greats as [[Abu Bakr Mohammad Ibn Zakariya al-Razi]]. However, despite such glorious tributes to his work, Ibn Sina is rarely remembered in the West today and his fundamental contributions to medicine and the European reawakening go largely unrecognised. 

Ibn Sina is usually considered as a great philosopher and physician. His philosophical disciple is not a live school in western philosophy today. Unfortunately, the West only pays attention to some portion of his philosophy, which is known as the ''Latin Avicennaian School,''  and his other significant philosophical contribution, which had been hailed by [[Suhrawardi]], is still unknown to West. This notable part is called '''حكمت مشرقيه''' (''hikmat-al-mashriqqiyya'') by him. In some of his writings, he mentions this to his disciples as his major achievement. Heavily influenced by Ibn Sina, [[Suhrawardi]] made philosophical contributions which have developed much from  Ibn Sina's work, later founding [[illuminationist philosophy]] and believing to have finished what Ibn Sina began.

Ibn Sina also wrote extensively on the subjects of [[philosophy]], [[logic]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]] and other disciplines.  All his works were written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] - which was the ''de facto'' scientific [[language]] of that time, and some were written in the Persian language. Of linguistic significance even to this day are a few books that he wrote in nearly pure Persian language[citation needed]. Unlike [[Aquinas]] who more or less sanctified Aristotle as church dogma, Ibn Sina corrected him often, encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of [[ijtihad]].  Accordingly he is one of the earliest pioneers of the scientific process of [[peer review]] as we know it today, his influence on that process being profound at least, and perhaps even decisive.

About 100 treatises were ascribed to Ibn Sina. Some of them are tracts of a few pages, others are works extending through several volumes. The best-known amongst them, and that to which Ibn Sina owed his European reputation, is his 14-volume ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', which was a standard medical text in Western Europe for seven centuries.  It classifies and describes diseases, and outlines their assumed causes.  [[Hygiene]], simple and complex medicines, and functions of parts of the body are also covered.  It asserts that [[tuberculosis]] was contagious, which was later disputed by Europeans, but turned out to be true.  It also describes the symptoms and complications of [[diabetes]].  An Arabic edition of the ''Canons'' appeared at Rome in [[1593]], and a Hebrew version at Naples in [[1491]]. Of the Latin version there were about thirty editions, founded on the original translation by [[Gerard of Cremona]]. The [[15th century]] has the honour of composing the great commentary on the text of the ''Canon'', grouping around it all that theory had imagined, and all that practice had observed. Other medical works translated into Latin are the ''Medicamenta Cordialia'', ''Canticum de Medicina'', and the ''Tractatus de Syrupo Acetoso''. 

It was mainly accident which determined that from the [[12th century|12th]] to the [[17th century]] Ibn Sina should be the guide of medical study in European universities, and eclipse the names of Rhazes, [[Ali ibn al-Abbas]] and [[Averroes]]. His work is not essentially different from that of his predecessor Rhazes, because he presented the doctrine of [[Galen]], and through Galen the doctrine of [[Hippocrates]], modified by the system of Aristotle. But the ''Canon'' of Avicenna is distinguished from the ''Al-Hawi'' (Continens) or ''Summary'' of Rhazes by its greater method, due perhaps to the logical studies of the former. The work has been variously appreciated in subsequent ages, some regarding it as a treasury of wisdom, and others, like [[Averroes]], holding it useful only as waste paper. In modern times it has been more criticized than read. The vice of the book is excessive classification of bodily faculties, and over-subtlety in the discrimination of diseases. It includes five books; of which the first and second treat of [[physiology]], [[pathology]] and [[hygiene]], the third and fourth deal with the methods of treating disease, and the fifth describes the composition and preparation of remedies. This last part contains some personal observations. He is, like all his countrymen, ample in the enumeration of symptoms, and is said to be inferior to Ali in practical medicine and [[surgery]]. He introduced into medical theory the four causes of the [[Peripatetic]] system. Of [[natural history]] and [[botany]] he pretended to no special knowledge. Up to the year [[1650]], or thereabouts, the ''Canon'' was still used as a textbook in the universities of [[Leuven]] and [[Montpellier]].

Scarcely any member of the Arabian circle of the sciences, including [[theology]], [[philology]], [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], and [[music]], was left untouched by the treatises of Ibn Sina, many of which probably varied little, except in being commissioned by a different patron and having a different form or extent. He wrote at least one treatise on [[alchemy]], but several others have been falsely attributed to him. His book on [[animal]]s was translated by [[Michael Scot]]. His ''Logic'', ''Metaphysics'', ''Physics'', and ''De Caelo'', are treatises giving a synoptic view of Aristotelian doctrine. The ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics'' have been printed more than once, the latter, e.g., at Venice in [[1493]], [[1495]], and [[1546]]. Some of his shorter essays on medicine, logic, &amp;c., take a poetical form (the poem on logic was published by Schmoelders in [[1836]]). Two encyclopaedic treatises, dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned. The larger, [[Al-Shifa']] (''Sanatio''), exists nearly complete in manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] and elsewhere; part of it on the ''De Anima'' appeared at Pavia ([[1490]]) as the ''Liber Sextus Naturalium'', and the long account of Ibn Sina's philosophy given by [[Shahrastani]] seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the Al-Shifa'. A shorter form of the work is known as the [[An-najat]] (''Liberatio''). The Latin editions of part of these works have been modified by the corrections which the monastic editors confess that they applied. There is also a ''Philosophia Orientalis'', mentioned by [[Roger Bacon]], and now lost, which according to Averroes was pantheistic in tone.

In the museum at [[Bukhara]], there are displays showing many of his writings, surgical instruments from the period and paintings of patients undergoing treatment. 

In Iran, he is considered a Persian hero. He is often regarded as one of the greatest Persians who have ever lived. Many of his portraits and statues remain in Iran today. An impressive monument to the life and works of the man who is known as the 'doctor of doctors' still stands outside the Bukhara museum and his portrait hangs in the Hall of the Faculty of Medicine in the [[University of Paris]].

Ibn Sina was interested in the effect of the [[mind]] on the [[body]], and wrote a great deal on [[psychology]], likely influencing [[Ibn Tufayl]] and [[Ibn Bajjah]].

Along with [[Rhazes]], [[Ibn Nafis]], [[Al-Zahra]] and [[Al-Ibadi]], he is considered an important compiler of [[Early Muslim medicine]].

There is a crater on the moon called [[Avicenna (crater)|Avicenna]] which was named after him.

[[Image:Ashes_urn.jpg|right|frame|The Ashes [[urn]] is reputed to contain a set of burnt [[bail (cricket)|bails]] symbolising the death of English cricket.]]
'''The Ashes''' is a [[biennial]] [[Test cricket]] contest played between [[English cricket team|England]] and [[Australian cricket team|Australia]].  The Ashes is one of cricket's fiercest and most celebrated rivalries, and certainly the oldest such in international cricket, dating back to 1882.  The [[The 2005 Ashes|2005 Ashes series]] was played in [[England]], and was won by England. Australia had held the Ashes for 16 years prior to that. The next Ashes series will be in [[Australia]] in 2006-07; the next series in England will be in 2009.

The series is named after a [[satire|satirical]] [[obituary]] published in ''The Sporting Times'' in 1882 following the match at [[The Oval]], in which Australia beat England in [[England]] for the first time.  The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and ''the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia''.  The English media dubbed the next English tour to [[Australia]] as ''the quest to regain The Ashes''. A small [[terra cotta|terracotta]] urn was presented to the [[English cricket captains|England captain]] [[Ivo Bligh]] by a group of [[Melbourne]] women after England's victory in the Test series.  The urn is reputed to contain a set of burnt [[bail (cricket)|bails]] symbolising &quot;the ashes of English cricket&quot;.  While the urn has come to symbolise the Ashes series, the name ''The Ashes'' predates the existence of the urn.  The urn is not used as a [[trophy]] for the Ashes series, and whichever side &quot;holds&quot; the Ashes, the urn remains in the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] Museum at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]].  Since the 1998-99 Ashes series, a [[Waterford crystal]] trophy has been presented to the winners.

Notable Ashes series took place in 1932-33 (the [[Bodyline]] tour), 1948 ([[Donald Bradman|Sir Donald Bradman's]] &quot;[[The Invincibles (cricket)|Invincibles]]&quot; Australian side), 1981 (in which an England team spearheaded by [[Ian Botham]] won a thrilling series), and 2005 (when England eventually won the Ashes back, after a 'drought' of 16 years).

==The obituary==
[[Image:DeathofEnglishCricket.jpg|250px|thumb|The obituary notice that appeared in ''The Sporting Times''.]] The first Test match between England and Australia had been played in 1877, but the Ashes legend dates back only to their ninth Test match, played in 1882. 

On the 1882 tour, the Australians played only one Test, at [[The Oval]] in [[London]]. It was a low-scoring game on a difficult [[Cricket pitch|pitch]]. Australia made only 63 runs in their first [[innings]], and England, led by [[Monkey Hornby]], took a 38-run lead with a total of 101. In the second innings, Australia made 122, leaving England to score only 85 [[The result in cricket|runs to win]]. Australian bowler [[Fred Spofforth]] refused to give in, declaring, &quot;This thing can be done&quot;. He devastated the English batting, taking the final four wickets while conceding only two runs, to leave England a mere seven runs short of victory in one of the closest and most nail-biting finishes in [[history of cricket|cricket history]].

When England's last batsman went in the team needed only 10 runs to win, but the final batsman Peate scored only 2 before being bowled by Boyle. The astonished crowd fell silent, not believing that England could possibly have lost by 7 runs. When what had happened had sunk in, the crowd cheered the Australians. 

When Peate returned to the Pavilion he was reprimanded by [[WG Grace]] for not allowing his partner at the wicket [[Charles Studd]] to get the runs. Despite Studd being one of the best batsman in England, Peate replied, &quot;I had no confidence in Mr Studd, sir, so thought I had better do my best.&quot; 

The defeat was widely recorded in the English press. The most notable report was a mock obituary, written by [[Reginald Shirley Brooks]], printed in ''[[The Sporting Times]]'' on the following Saturday, [[September 2]] [[1882]]. The obituary read as follows:

:&quot;In Affectionate Remembrance of ENGLISH CRICKET, which died at the Oval on 29th&amp;nbsp;AUGUST, 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances R.I.P.
:N.B. &amp;mdash; The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.&quot;

The English media played up the subsequent tour to Australia in 1882-83 (which had been arranged before this defeat) as a quest to &quot;regain the Ashes&quot;.

==The Ashes urn==
After the third game of the 1882-83 tour, the English team, led by [[Ivo Bligh]] were guests of Sir William Clarke, at his property &quot;[[Rupertswood]]&quot; at [[Sunbury, Victoria]].  A group of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n ladies headed by Lady Clarke burned what has variously been called a ball, bail or veil {{ref|Terminology}}, and presented the resulting ashes to Bligh in an [[urn]] together with a velvet bag, which was made by Mrs Ann Fletcher, the daughter of Joseph Hines Clarke and Marion Wright, both of [[Dublin]]. She said, &quot;What better way than to actually present the English captain with the very 'object' &amp;mdash; albeit mythical &amp;mdash; he had come to Australia to retrieve?&quot; Bligh later married another of these [[Melbourne|Melburnian]] ladies, Florence Morphy. When he died in 1927, his widow presented the urn to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]]. The urn itself is made of [[terracotta]] and is about four&amp;nbsp;[[inch]]es (10&amp;nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]]) tall.

A poem was presented to Bligh with the urn and appears on it {{ref|poem}}:
:''When [[Ivo Bligh|Ivo]] goes back with the urn, the urn;''
:''[[Studd brothers|Studds]], [[Allan Steel|Steel]], [[Walter Read|Read]] and [[Edward Tylecote|Tylecote]] return, return;''
:''The welkin will ring loud,''
:''The great crowd will feel proud,''
:''Seeing [[Dick Barlow|Barlow]] and [[Billy Bates|Bates]] with the urn, the urn;''
:''And the rest coming home with the urn.''

The Ashes urn itself is never physically awarded to either England or Australia, but is kept permanently in the MCC Cricket Museum at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]], where it can be seen together with a specially-made red and gold velvet bag and the scorecard of the 1882 match. 

The urn has been back to Australia once, in 1988 for a museum tour as part of Australia's [[Bicentennial]] celebrations. In the 1990s, given Australia's long dominance of the Ashes series, the idea was mooted that the victorious team in an Ashes series should be awarded the urn as a trophy and allowed to retain it until the next series. The MCC, considering the urn too fragile to transport to Australia, instead began commissioning a larger-scale replica trophy in [[Waterford Crystal]] to award to the winning team of each series.

In 2002, Bligh's great-great-grandson (Lord Clifton, the heir-apparent to the [[Earl of Darnley|Earldom of Darnley]]) argued that the Ashes urn should not be returned to Australia as it was essentially the property of his family and only given to the MCC for safe-keeping.

==The matches==
''See also: [[List of Ashes series]] for a full listing of all the Ashes series since 1882.''

===First Ashes quest===
''See also: [[History of Test cricket (to 1883)#The Ashes legend|History of Test cricket (to 1883): The Ashes legend]]''

The [[Honourable Ivo Bligh]] led the expedition to Australia to &quot;recover the Ashes&quot; against the side that had beaten England earlier in 1882. Publicity surrounding the series was intense, and it was at some time during this series that the Ashes urn was crafted. Australia won the first Test by [[The result in cricket|nine wickets]], but in the next two England were victorious. At the end of the third Test, the four-inch urn was presented to Bligh by some Melburnian ladies, England having been generally considered to have &quot;won back the Ashes&quot; 2&amp;ndash;1. A fourth match was in fact played, against a &quot;United Australian XI&quot;, which was stronger than the Australian side that had competed in the previous matches; this game, however, is not considered part of the Ashes series.

===English dominance ends===
After this series followed an extended period of English dominance. The tours were shorter in the 1880s and 1890s than people have grown accustomed to in more recent years, possibly owing to the extended travelling time (the sea journey between the two countries took at least a month). Thus, England only lost four Ashes Tests in the 1880s, out of 23 played, and they won all the seven series contested. There was also more chopping and changing in the teams, there was no official board of selectors for each country (at times, two competing sides toured a nation), and popularity with the fans varied. The 1890s games were more closely fought, Australia taking their first series win since the match that sparked the legend in 1891-92 with a 2&amp;ndash;1 victory. England still dominated, winning the next three series despite continued player disputes. Towards the end of the decade, though, the Australians got more of a foothold, winning four successive series from 1897-98 to 1902.

===Repopularising of the Ashes===
After what the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] saw as the problems of the earlier professional and amateur series, they decided to take control of organising tours themselves, and this led to the first MCC tour of Australia in 1903-1904. England won it against the odds, and [[Plum Warner]], the England captain, wrote up his version of the tour in his book ''How We Recovered The Ashes''. This book repopularised the Ashes myth in England, which continues to this day.

England and Australia shared the spoils for the next few years. The entrance of [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] onto the world cricketing scene meant less time for Ashes series, but even so there were four played after Plum Warner's series, each of the sides taking two victories. England won the last series in 1911-1912 by four matches to one, [[Jack Hobbs|Sir Jack Hobbs]] establishing himself as a regular with three centuries. England then retained the Ashes when they won the Triangular tournament, which also featured [[South African cricket team|South Africa]], in 1912. England looked as if they had established themselves as the dominating force by the time [[World War I]] intervened and brought a halt to all international cricket.

After the war, however, Australia took firm control of both the Ashes and world cricket. They recorded thumping victories both in England and on home soil, and England only won one Test out of fifteen from the end of the war until 1925. In a rain-hit series in 1926, however, England managed to eke out a 1&amp;ndash;0 victory with a win in the final Test at the Oval, and despite the appearance of Donald Bradman, Australia could not win the next series either, losing 4&amp;ndash;1. Bradman won the next series almost by himself, however, as one of the best batting line-ups of all time began to form in the early 1930s, including Bradman himself, [[Stan McCabe]] and [[Bill Ponsford]]. It was the prospect of bowling at this line-up that caused England's captain [[Douglas Jardine]] to think up the [[Bodyline]] tactic.

===Bodyline===
{{main|Bodyline}}
[[Image:4th Test Fingleton.jpg|220px|right|thumb| [[Bill Woodfull]] evades a ball from [[Harold Larwood]] with [[Bodyline]] field settings.]]
In 1932, after Bradman's routing of the English team in the previous series, [[Douglas Jardine]] developed a tactic of instructing his [[fast bowling|fast bowlers]] to bowl at the bodies of the Australian batsmen, with the goal of forcing them to defend their bodies with their bats, and provide easy catches to a stacked [[leg side]] field. The tactic was descriptively dubbed Bodyline. Although this won England the Ashes, it caused such a furore in Australia that diplomats had to intervene to prevent serious harm to Anglo-Australian relations, and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] eventually changed the [[laws of cricket]] to prevent anyone from using the tactic again.

Jardine's comments summed up England's views: &quot;I've not travelled 6,000&amp;nbsp;miles to make friends. I'm here to win the Ashes.&quot;

On the batting-friendly [[pitch|wickets]] that prevailed in the late 1930s, most Tests up to the war still gave results, although many batting records were set in this era. [[Len Hutton]] scored 364 at [[The Oval]] to save a draw in the 1938 series, a world record [[innings]], while [[Jack Fingleton]] and Bradman set a sixth-wicket [[partnership (cricket)|partnership]] record of 346 runs in the Third Test at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]] that stands to this day. The series were surprisingly competitive, though, considering England's desperation in the early 30s.

===''The Invincibles''===
{{main|The Invincibles (cricket)}}
Australia's first tour of England after [[World War II]], in 1948, was led by the 39-year-old Bradman in his last appearance representing Australia. His team has gone down in cricketing legend as ''[[The Invincibles (cricket)|The Invincibles]]'', as they played 36 matches including five Tests, and remained unbeaten on the tour. They won 27 matches, drawing only 9, including of course the 4&amp;ndash;0 Ashes series victory.

This series is also known for one of the most poignant moments in cricket history, as Bradman batted for Australia in the fifth Test at The Oval &amp;mdash; his last &amp;mdash; needing to score only 4 runs to maintain a career [[batting average]] of 100. [[Eric Hollies]] bowled him second ball for a duck, denying those 4 runs and sending Bradman into retirement with a career average of 99.94.

Australia gradually weakened after 1948, allowing England back into the fray in the early 1950s when they won three successive Ashes series, from 1953 to 1956 to be arguably the best Test side in the world at the time. A see-sawing series in 1956 also saw a record that will probably never be beaten:  the spinner [[Jim Laker|Jim Laker's]] monumental effort at [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]] when he bowled 68 of 191 overs to take nineteen out of twenty possible Australian wickets. Never has the phrase &quot;He won the match single-handedly&quot; been more appropriate. England's dominance was not to last, however. Australia thumped them 4&amp;ndash;0 when they next toured in 1958-59, having found a good bowler of their own in [[Richie Benaud]] who took 31 wickets in the 5-Test series. England failed to win any series during the 1960s, a period dominated by draws as teams found it more prudent to save face with a draw than risk losing. Of a total of 25 Ashes Tests playing during this decade, Australia won seven and England three.

In the first series of the 1970s, however, England managed to win 2&amp;ndash;0, much thanks to the efforts of [[Geoffrey Boycott]] who scored four fifties and three centuries in the series, but in the mid-1970s Australia regained ascendancy with fast bowler [[Dennis Lillee]] taking English wickets all too consistently. However, both teams had their victories, England enjoying an emphatic 5&amp;ndash;1 win in 1978-79 while Australia took a non-Ashes series (with the [[World Series Cricket|WSC]] players returning) 3&amp;ndash;0 a year later. Most would say that the two sides were evenly matched, but no one knew just how evenly they would be matched in the next one.

===Botham's Ashes===
Australia took a 1&amp;ndash;0 lead in the first two Tests of the 1981 series, and looked to make it 2&amp;ndash;0 in the third Test at Headingley when they forced England to follow-on 227 runs behind. Famously, an English bookmaker offered odds of 500&amp;ndash;1 for an English victory, and Australian players [[Dennis Lillee]] and [[Rod Marsh]] laid a small bet. This came back to haunt them as England, reduced to 135 for 7 wickets, produced a second innings of 356, [[Ian Botham]] scoring an unbeaten 149, and adding 221 for the last three wickets in partnerships with [[Graham Dilley]], [[Chris Old]] and their fast bowler [[Bob Willis]].  Chasing 130, Australia were dismissed for 111, with a devastating spell of 8&amp;ndash;43 by Willis giving England a miraculous victory by 18 runs.  Lillee and Marsh were reprimanded for betting on the outcome of a game, but not suspended.

The fourth Test at Edgbaston was a similarly inspired comeback victory for England. [[Ian Botham]] this time starred with the ball, taking five for 11, including a spell of five wickets for a solitary run, in Australia's second innings of 121 to give England victory by 29 runs. England also went on to win the fifth Test at Old Trafford to retain the Ashes&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the sixth Test at the Oval was drawn.

===Australian dominance===
England were the better team of the early 1980s, although it was close:  Australia won the 1982-83 series, but England then took two victories in 1985 and 1986-87. After those wins, however, a period of extended Australian dominance began, and England did not win an Ashes series again until 2005. Australia won the 1989 series 4&amp;ndash;0, and an England side weakened by Test bans following the [[Mike Gatting|Gatting]] tour to apartheid [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] lost 3&amp;ndash;0 in 1990-91. The Australians underlined their superiority in the contest by winning the 1993, 1994-95, 1997, 1998-99 and 2001 series &amp;mdash; all by convincing margins.

Australia's record since 1989 has impacted upon the overall statistics between the two sides. Before the 1989 series began, Australia had won 36.9% of all Tests played against England, England 33.5% with 29.7% of matches ending in draws. Previous to the 2005 series, Australia had won 40.8% of all Tests, England 31% with 28.1% drawn.{{Ref|stats1}}

In the period between 1989 and the beginning of the 2005 series, the two sides had played 43 times. Australia winning 28 times, England 7 times, with 8 draws.{{Ref|stats2}}

===Steve Waugh's last Ashes===
{{main|England in Australia in 2002-3}}

After playing in nine successive Ashes series, the 2002-03 rubber was to be Australian captain [[Steve Waugh|Steve Waugh's]] last against England, and was to prove one of the most emphatic victories he enjoyed against the English. The series began with what many regard in hindsight as one of the worst captaincy decisions of all time, as [[Nasser Hussain]] won the toss for England in the first Test and sent Australia in to bat. By the end of the first day, Australia had amassed a staggering 364/2, and placed a stamp of authority on the series that would not be undone as they raced to victory by 384 runs. This was followed by two innings victories to Australia, and a fairly comfortable five-wicket win. England only managed to save some face with a 225-run victory in the final Test. 

The series' most memorable moment came on the second day of the Fifth Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. Leading into the match Waugh had been heavily scrutinised by selectors and the media over his advancing age and lack of recent form, having not posted a Test century since 2001. As this was the last match of the series and last Test of the Australian summer, Waugh was likely to be dropped from the team if he failed again in this match. Asked before the match about the defining moment of a career likely to soon be over, Waugh predicted gamely &quot;It might be yet to come.&quot; In a stunning display of determination and defiance, he then fulfilled this prophesy by scoring a chanceless century on the second afternoon. He had entered the final over of the day on 95 not out, and hit a boundary off the last ball (bowled by English off spinner [[Richard Dawson (cricketer)|Richard Dawson]]) to bring up his ton. Waugh left the ground to an emotional standing ovation, his Test career saved. It came to be known as his 'Perfect Day'.

===The 2005 series===
{{main|The 2005 Ashes}}

England were undefeated in Test matches in the 2004 calendar year, which took the team to second in the [[LG ICC Test Championship]] and raised hopes that the [[The 2005 Ashes|2005 Ashes series]] would be closely fought. In fact, the series proved to be even more competitive than most commentators had predicted. 

The first Test was played at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] from [[21 July]] to [[24 July]], and was won convincingly by Australia by 239 runs. However, England fought back in the remaining four matches, which were all tense and closely fought.  The second Test, played at [[Edgbaston Stadium|Edgbaston]] from [[4 August]] to [[7 August]] was won by England by 2 runs, the smallest runs victory margin in Ashes history, and the second closest runs victory margin in all Tests.  The rain-affected third Test, played at [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]] from [[11 August]] to [[15 August]], ended with the final two Australian batsmen holding out to claim a draw. The fourth Test, played at [[Trent Bridge]] from [[25 August]] to [[28 August]], was won by England by three wickets after Australia was forced to [[follow on]] for the first time in 191 Tests.  England earned a draw at the fifth and final Test match, played at [[The Oval]] from [[8 September]] to [[12 September]], to win an Ashes series for the first time in 18 years.

From the start the 2005 Ashes series was played at a very high intensity and the tension did occasionally lead to mistakes on both sides with many dropped catches, run outs and other errors. Australia were unlucky with the injury to a key bowler [[Glenn McGrath]] (who missed the two matches when Australia was beaten) and the loss of form of others such as [[Jason Gillespie]], [[Adam Gilchrist]] and [[Matthew Hayden]], whereas England were able to pick the same eleven until [[Simon Jones (cricketer)|Simon Jones]] sustained an ankle injury midway through the Fourth Test, forcing him out of the series decider. However many consider the series to have been the most exciting in living memory, providing enthralling viewing to those lucky enough to get the very scarce tickets for the matches, or those watching on television. Respected commentator [[Richie Benaud]] is reported by BBC correspondent Bob Chaundry {{Ref|Benaud}} as having said: &quot;In the past two years, I've seen the best cricket I've ever watched. This current Ashes series shades even the great one of 1981.&quot;  

At the end of the series, [[Andrew Flintoff]] was awarded the inaugural [[Compton-Miller medal]] as the player of the series for his [[all-rounder|batting and bowling]] efforts. Flintoff was also chosen as &quot;Man of the Series&quot; by the Australian coach and his English counterpart chose [[Shane Warne]], who took 40 wickets in the five matches and batted skilfully down the order.

England will travel to Australia in the winter of 2006-2007 in the hope to retain the Ashes.

==Summary of results and statistics==
:''See also: [[List of Ashes series]] for a full listing of all the Ashes series since 1882.''
{{Ashes timeline}}
[[image:Ashesmatcheschart.png|thumb|200px|Chart of the matches won between the two sides.]]
A team must win a series to gain the right to hold the Ashes. A drawn series results in the previous holders retaining the Ashes. To date, a total of 62 Ashes series have been played with Australia winning 30, England winning 27. The remaining five series were drawn, with Australia retaining the Ashes four times and England retaining it once.

Ashes series have generally been played over five Test matches, although there have been four match series (1938; 1975) and six match series (1970-71; 1974-75; 1978-79; 1981; 1985; 1989; 1993 and 1997).  293 matches have been played, with Australia winning 115 times, England 92 times, and 86 draws.  Australians have made 264 [[century|centuries]] in Ashes Tests, twenty-three of them over 200, while Englishmen have scored 212 centuries, of which ten have been scores over 200. On 41 occasions, individual Australians have taken ten [[wicket]]s in a match. Englishmen have performed that feat 38 times.

==The Ashes today==
The Ashes is one of the most fiercely contested competitions in cricket today, rivalling the intensity of the other great international cricket rivalry between [[Indian cricket team|India]] and [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] . The failure of England to regain the Ashes for 16 years from 1989, coupled with the global dominance of the Australian team, had dulled the lustre of the series in recent years. But the close results in the [[The 2005 Ashes|2005 Ashes series]], and the overall high quality and competitiveness of the cricket, have boosted the popularity of the sport in Britain and considerably enhanced the profile of the Ashes around the world.  Whilst the tension of the matches has caused an occasional angry moment, the matches were generally played with good spirit, and [[sportsmanship]] of the players of both sides has been high, with commentators often highlighting [[Andrew Flintoff]] consoling [[Brett Lee]] at the end of the second Test as epitomising this. In interviews following the final match, players from both sides were quick to congratulate their opponents, both the individual players and the team as a whole.

==Match venues==
The series alternate between England and Australia, and within each country each of the (usually) five matches is held at a different [[List of Test cricket grounds|cricket ground]].

In '''Australia''', the grounds currently used are the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (first staged an England-Australia Test in the 1876-77 season), the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] (1881-82), [[Adelaide Oval]] (1884-85), [[Brisbane Cricket Ground|The Gabba]] (1932-33) and [[WACA|The WACA, Perth]] (1970-71). One Test was held at the [[Exhibition Ground|Brisbane Exhibition Ground]] in 1928-29.

In '''England''' the grounds used are [[The Oval]] (since 1880), [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]] (1884), [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] (1884), [[Trent Bridge]] (1899), [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] (1899) and [[Edgbaston Stadium|Edgbaston]] (1902). One Test was held at [[Bramall Lane|Bramall Lane, Sheffield]] in 1902.

==The Ashes outside cricket==
The popularity and reputation of the cricket series has led to many other events taking the name for England against Australia contests.  The best-known and longest-running of these events is the [[rugby league]] contest between [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] (see [[Rugby League Ashes]]).  The contest first started in 1908, the name being suggested by the touring Australians.  Another example is in the British television show ''[[Gladiators]]'', where two series were based around the Australia&amp;ndash;England contest.

The trophy is also featured in the [[science-fiction]] [[comedy]] [[novel]] ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'', the third &quot;[[Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy]]&quot; book by [[Douglas Adams]].

In the cinema, the Ashes featured in the [[film]] ''The Final Test'', released in 1953, based on a television play by [[Terence Rattigan]].  It stars [[Jack Warner]] as an England cricketer playing the last Test of his career, which is the last of an Ashes series; the film contains cameo appearances from prominent contemporary Ashes cricketers including [[Jim Laker]] and [[Denis Compton]].

==Notes==
# {{note|Terminology}} In 1998, Lord Darnley’s 82-year-old daughter-in-law said they were the remains of her mother-in-law’s veil, not a bail. Other evidence suggests a ball. The precise origin of the ashes, therefore, is the subject of some dispute.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AC LgPic Gen2.jpg|thumb|Anne Rice]]
'''Anne Rice''' (born [[October 4]], [[1941]]) is a best-selling [[United States|American]] author of horror/fantasy books. She was born '''Howard Allen O'Brien''', the second daughter in a Catholic Irish-American family. Rice's works have had a major influence on the &quot;[[Goth]]&quot; movement, and she has also published a number of works with [[sado-masochistic]] themes. She was married to the late poet [[Stan Rice]] and is the mother of novelist [[Christopher Rice]]. Her daughter, Michele, was born on [[September 21]], [[1966]] and died of [[leukemia]] on [[August 5]] [[1972]]. Anne's sister, [[Alice Borchardt]], is also a noted genre author.

Rice was born and spent most of her life in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], the city that forms the background against which most of her stories take place.  About her unusual given name, Rice said: &quot;My birth name is Howard Allen because apparently my mother thought it was a good idea to name me Howard. My father's name was Howard, she wanted to name me after Howard, and she thought it was a very interesting thing to do. She was a bit of a Bohemian, a bit of mad woman, a bit of a genius, and a great deal of a great teacher. And she had the idea that naming a woman Howard was going to give that woman an unusual advantage in the world. &quot;
 
Anne became &quot;Anne&quot; on her first day of school, when a nun asked her what her name was. She blurted out &quot;Anne&quot; immediately, and her mother, who was with her, let it go without correcting her, knowing how self-conscious her daughter was of her real name

Known for her avid interest in art and culture, Anne and her family occasionally took trips overseas to study the art later mentioned in her stories. More recently, following the death of her husband Stan Rice, she has relocated to the [[Coachella Valley]], California area to be nearer her son, Christopher.  After spending most of her adult life as a self described [[atheist]], Rice returned to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1998, and she is currently working on a trilogy about the life of [[Jesus]]. 

Rice has also published erotica under the [[pen name]]s '''Anne Rampling''' and '''A.N. Roquelaure''', the latter of which was used primarily for more adult-oriented material. Her fiction is often described as lush and descriptive, and her characters' sexuality is fluid, often displaying homoerotic feelings towards each other.  She also deals with philosophical and historic themes, weaving them in to the dense pattern of her books, and giving them a highly intellectual, if not highly literary, content.  To her admirers, Rice's books are among the best in modern [[popular fiction]], considered by some to possess those elements that create a lasting presence in the literary canon. To her critics, her novels are baroque, &quot;low-brow pulp&quot; and redundant.  

A critical analysis of Rice's work can be found in [[S. T. Joshi]]'s book ''The Modern Weird Tale'' (2001).

=== Conversion to a Christian Novelist===
In October of 2005, Rice announced in a [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9785289/site/newsweek/ Newsweek article] that she would &quot;write only for the Lord&quot;.  Her first novel in the genre is called ''[[Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt]]'' and is the first in a trilogy that will chronicle the life of Christ.

===The Vampire Chronicles===
She completed her first book, ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'', in 1973 and published it in 1976. 

''Interview with the Vampire'' can also be viewed as an example of [[psychedelic literature]]. Rice herself has denied ever having experimented with [[LSD]]. &quot;I'm a totally conservative person. In the middle of [[Haight-Ashbury]] in the 1960s, I was typing away while everybody was dropping acid and smoking grass. I was known as my own square.&quot; (''[[New York Times]]'', Nov 7, 1988) Her protagonist Louis, however, describes a heightened awareness after being transformed into a vampire which does mirror the LSD experience to some extent.

Rice has said that Claudia, the young girl in the book, was inspired by her late daughter.

===Film Adaptations===
In [[1994]], [[Neil Jordan]] directed a [[motion picture]] adaption of [[Interview with the Vampire]], based on the story, but with some minor changes. A second movie was later made, inspired by the second and third books in the original ''Vampire Chronicles'' series. The title was that of the third book, ''[[The Queen of the Damned]]''.  The storyline chosen by the producers of the second film is controversial among many fans of her books. Major plot points of both books were altered, and it has been rumoured that the second film's theatrical release was based solely on its producers' wish to capitalize on the death of [[Aaliyah]]. Another rumor being that [[Warner Bros.]] was already into its last year of owning motion picture rights to the first three [[The Vampire Chronicles|Vampire Chronicles]] books, which would then have transferred back to author Anne Rice once this period was over. Once back in her ownership, she could then sell the rights to another company of her choosing. Knowing what little time they had left, despite the fact they've had the rights and opportunity to make the latter two movies for over seven years, Warner Bros. hastily hired writers to condense the books &quot;''[[The Vampire Lestat]]''&quot; and &quot;''[[The Queen of the Damned]]''&quot; into one movie in order to profit from their initial rights purchase.

A film named ''Exit to Eden'' based loosely on Rice's book of the same name starred [[Rosie O'Donnell]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]].  The plot was seriously altered, with the work transformed from a love story into a police comedy, possibly due to the explicit [[S&amp;M]] nature of the book. 

===Health===
Rice has Type 1 [[diabetes]]. This was discovered when she went into a [[diabetic coma]] in December 1998. She is an advocate for people to get tested for diabetes. Because of a lifelong battle with her weight as well as depression due to the long illness and subsequent death of her husband, Rice's weight ballooned to 254 pounds. Tired of dealing with [[sleep apnea]], limited mobility, and other weight-related problems, she had [[gastric bypass]] surgery on [[January 15], [[2003]].

===Leaving New Orleans===

On [[ January 30]], [[2004]] Rice announced her plans to leave New Orleans to move the suburb of [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana]]. She had already put the largest of her three homes in [[Uptown New Orleans]] up for sale, and plans to sell the other two. She cited living alone since the death of her husband and her son's moving out of state as the reasons. &quot;Simplifying my life, not owning so much, that's the chief goal&quot;, said Rice. &quot;I'll no longer be a citizen of New Orleans in the true sense.&quot; 

In spring 2005 Anne Rice moved to [[La Jolla]], [[California]]. She calls her new home &quot;Paradise West&quot;. Some have speculated that Rice also wished for more privacy from the constant attentions of her fans, who were known to camp out in front of her house. Sometimes, up to 200 or more would gather to see her leave for [[church]] on Sundays. 

===Fanfiction Stance===

Rice is very adamant about preventing any [[fan fiction]] of her books-- on [[April 7]], [[2000]], she released a statement on her website that prohibited all fanfiction involving her work. This caused the removal of thousands of fanfics from the popular [[Fanfiction.Net]] website.

===Amazon incident===
On [[September 6]], [[2004]], Rice posted a reply to a number of negative reviews that had appeared on [[Amazon.com]] regarding ''[[Blood Canticle]]''. She titled her reply, [http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-content-search/document/102-0196178-4104136?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;documentId=R1FLRHCYSK13PB&amp;index=community-reviews-realtime&amp;query=ASIN%3A037541200X%20from%20the%20author%20to &quot;From the Author to the Some of the Negative Voices Here.&quot;]  This post generated a great deal of publicity online -- partly because authors rarely post or respond to reviews on Amazon, and partly because of the tone and nature of her text. Many previous reviews had criticized the quality of writing in ''Blood Canticle'' as lazy or shoddy; so when Rice replied by posting a 1,200-word paragraph wherein she proudly dismisses the utility of editors, the incident became fodder for [[weblog]]s and [[Internet]] sites.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AbnerDoubleday.jpeg|thumb|Abner Doubleday]]
'''Abner Doubleday''' ([[June 26]], [[1819]] &amp;ndash; [[January 26]], [[1893]]), was a career [[U.S. Army]] officer and [[Union army|Union]] general in the [[American Civil War]]. He fired the first shot in defense of [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], the opening battle of the war. Although he himself made no such claim, some believe he should be credited with the invention of [[baseball]].

==Early years==
Doubleday was born in [[Ballston Spa, New York]]. His grandfather had fought in the [[Revolutionary War]] and his father served four years in the [[U.S. Congress]]. Abner practiced as a civil engineer for two years before entering the [[U.S. Military Academy]], from which graduated in 1842 and was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in the 3rd U.S. Artillery.

==Military career==
Doubleday served in the [[Mexican-American War]] and [[Seminole Wars]]. At the start of the Civil War, he was a captain in the garrison at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston Harbor]], under [[Major Robert Anderson]]. He aimed the cannon that fired the first return shot in answer to the [[Confederate States Army | Confederate]] bombardment on [[April 12]], [[1861]], starting the war.

Doubleday served in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] from June to August, 1861. He was appointed [[brigadier general]] of volunteers on [[February 3]], [[1862]], and led the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, [[III Corps (ACW)|III Corps]] at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]]. He took command of the division on [[August 30]] when its commander was wounded. He again led the division at [[Battle of South Mountain|South Mountain]], [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] (where he was wounded by a shell exploding nearby), and [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] (where his division mostly sat idle).

Doubleday was promoted to [[major general]] of volunteers on [[November 9]], [[1862]], and commanded 3rd Division, [[I Corps (ACW)|I Corps]], at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], and took over corps command for a day when General [[John F. Reynolds]] was killed in opening of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], [[July 9]], [[1863]]. Army commander [[George G. Meade]] replaced Doubleday with [[John Newton (ACW) | John Newton]], a more junior major general from another corps, after the first day of battle, one in which the I Corps was overwhelmed by a Confederate assault. Meade had a long history of disdain for Doubleday's combat effectiveness, dating back to South Mountain. Doubleday was humiliated by this snub and held a lasting grudge against Meade. He was wounded in the neck on the second day of the battle and assumed mostly administrative duties in the defenses of [[Washington, D.C.]], including the attack by [[Jubal A. Early]] in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]].

==Later life==
After the Civil War, Doubleday retired from the Army in 1873 and moved to [[San Francisco]], where he obtained a charter for the [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] railway that still runs there. By 1878, he was living in [[Mendham, New Jersey]], from where, that year, he became a prominent member of the [[Theosophical Society]]. When two of the founders of that society, [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]], moved to India at the end of that year, he was constituted as the President of the American body.

Doubleday died in Mendham, and is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in Arlington, Virginia.

==Legacy==
Although Doubleday was a competent, if colorless, combat general with experience in many important Civil War battles, the lore of baseball credits Doubleday with inventing the game, supposedly in [[Elihu Phinney]]'s cow pasture in [[Cooperstown, New York]], in 1839. 

The Mills Commission was appointed in 1905 to determine the origin of baseball. The committee's final report, on [[December 30]], [[1907]], stated, in part, that &quot;the first scheme for playing baseball, according to the best evidence obtainable to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at [[Cooperstown, New York]], in 1839.&quot;

However, there is [[Origins of baseball#Did Abner Doubleday invent baseball?|considerable evidence]] to dispute this claim. At his death, Doubleday left many letters and papers, none of which describe baseball, or give any suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person in the evolution of the game. An encyclopedia article about Doubleday published in 1911 makes no mention of the game. He was a cadet at [[West Point]] in the year of the alleged invention and there is no record he requested leave to travel to Cooperstown.

Doubleday published two important works on the Civil War: ''Reminiscences of Forts Sumter and Moultrie'' (1876), and ''Chancellorsville and Gettysburg'' (1882), the latter being a volume of the series ''Campaigns of the Civil War''. 

Doubleday's indecision as a commander earned him the uncomplimentary nickname &quot;Forty-Eight Hours&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Americas National Game''''' is a book by [[Albert Spalding]], published in [[1911]] detailing the early history of the [[game]] of [[baseball]].  Much of the story is told first hand, since Spalding had been involved in the game, first as a player and later an administrator, since the 1850s. In addition to his personal recollections he had access to the records of [[Henry Chadwick]], the game's first statistician and archivist.  Spalding was, however, known to aggrandise his role in the major moments in baseball's history.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amplitude modulation''' ('''AM''') is a form of [[modulation]] in which the [[amplitude]] of a [[carrier wave]] is varied in direct proportion to that of a modulating signal.  (Contrast this with [[frequency modulation]], in which the [[frequency]] of the carrier is varied; and [[phase modulation]], in which the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] is varied.)

AM is commonly used at [[Radio frequency|radio frequencies]] and was the first method used to [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] commercial [[radio]].  The term &quot;AM&quot; is sometimes used generically to refer to the AM broadcast ([[mediumwave]]) [[Band (electronics)|band]] (see [[AM radio]]).

== Applications in radio ==
[[Image:Amplitude-modulation.png|right|frame|An example of amplitude modulation.  The top diagram shows the modulating signal superimposed on the carrier wave.  The bottom diagram shows the resulting amplitude-modulated signal.  Notice how the peaks of the modulated output follow the contour of the original, modulating signal.]]

A basic AM radio [[transmitter]] works by first [[Direct current|DC]]-shifting the modulating signal, then multiplying it with the [[carrier wave]] using a [[frequency mixer]].  The output of this process is a signal with the same frequency as the carrier but with peaks and troughs that vary in proportion to the strength of the modulating signal.  This is [[amplifier|amplified]] and fed to an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]].

===AM vs. FM===
AM radio's main limitation is its susceptibility to atmospheric [[interference]], which is heard as [[white noise|static]] from the receiver.  The narrow [[bandwidth]] traditionally used for AM broadcasts further limits the quality of sound that can be received.  Since the 1970s, [[wideband]] [[FM]] has been preferred for musical broadcasts, due to its higher audio fidelity and noise-suppression characteristics.

The fact that signals can be decoded using very simple equipment is one of the primary advantages of amplitude modulation.  This was especially important in the early days of commercial radio, when [[Electronics|electronic]] components were still quite expensive.  This simplicity and affordability helped make AM one of the most popular methods for sending voice and music over radio during the 20th century.

An AM [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] consists primarily of a tunable [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]] and an [[envelope detector]], which in simpler sets is a single [[diode]].  Its output is a signal at the carrier frequency, with peaks that trace the amplitude of the unmodulated signal. Unlike other modulation techniques, this is all that is needed to recover the original audio.  In practice, a [[capacitor]] is used to undo the DC shift introduced by the transmitter and to eliminate the carrier frequency by connecting the signal peaks.  The output is then fed to an [[audio amplifier]].

[[Image:Am_radio.png|thumb|left|A network [[schematic]] of a simple AM receiver.  A diode functions as the [[envelope detector]], with the recovered audio fed directly to an [[earphone]].]]

To make a good AM receiver an [[automatic gain control]] loop is essential; this requires good design. To make a good FM receiver a large number of [[Radio frequency|RF]] amps which are driven into limiting are required to create a receiver which can take advantage of the [[capture effect]], one of the biggest advantages of FM. With valved (tube) systems it is more expensive to make active stages than it is to make the same number of stages with solid state parts, so for a valved [[superhet]] it is simpler to make an AM receiver with the automatic gain control loop while for a solid state receiver it is simpler to make an FM unit. Hence even while the idea of FM was known before [[WWII]] its use was rare because of the cost of valves - in the UK the government had a [[valve holder tax]] {{fact}} which encouraged radio receiver designers to use as few active stages as possible, - but when solid state parts became available FM started to gain favour. &lt;!-- By Horst Rebein --&gt;

== Forms of AM ==
In its basic form, amplitude modulation produces a signal with power concentrated at the carrier frequency and in two adjacent [[sideband]]s.  Each sideband is equal in [[bandwidth]] to that of the modulating signal and is a mirror image of the other.  Thus, most of the power output by an AM transmitter is effectively wasted: half the power is concentrated at the carrier frequency, which carries no useful information (beyond the fact that a signal is present); the remaining power is split between two identical sidebands, only one of which is needed.

To increase transmitter efficiency, the carrier can be removed (suppressed) from the AM signal.  This produces a [[reduced-carrier transmission]] or ''double-sideband suppressed carrier'' (DSBSC) signal.  If the carrier is only partially suppressed, a '''double-sideband reduced carrier''' (DSBRC) signal results.  DSBSC and DSBRC signals need their carrier to be regenerated (by a [[beat frequency oscillator]], for instance) to be demodulated using conventional techniques.

Even greater efficiency is achieved&amp;mdash;at the expense of increased transmitter and receiver complexity&amp;mdash;by completely suppressing both the carrier and one of the sidebands.  This is [[single-sideband modulation]], widely used in [[amateur radio]] due to its efficient use of both power and bandwidth.

A simple form of AM often used for [[digital]] communications is ''[[on-off keying]]'', a type of ''[[amplitude-shift keying]]'' by which [[Binary numeral system|binary]] data is represented as the presence or absence of a carrier wave.  This is commonly used at radio frequencies to transmit [[Morse code]], referred to as [[continuous wave]] (CW) operation.

== Example ==
Suppose we wish to modulate a simple sine wave on a carrier wave. The equation for the carrier wave of frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_c&lt;/math&gt;, taking its phase to be a reference phase of zero, is

:&lt;math&gt;c(t) = C \sin(\omega_c t)&lt;/math&gt;.

The equation for the simple sine wave of frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_m&lt;/math&gt; (the signal we wish to broadcast) is

:&lt;math&gt;m(t) = M \sin(\omega_m t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;,
with &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; its phase offset relative to &lt;math&gt;c(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

Amplitude modulation is performed simply by adding &lt;math&gt;m(t)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.  The amplitude-modulated signal is then

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = (C + M \sin(\omega_m t + \phi)) \sin(\omega_c t)&lt;/math&gt;

The formula for &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; above may be written

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = C \sin(\omega_c t) + M \frac{\cos(\phi - (\omega_m - \omega_c) t)}{2} - M \frac{\cos(\phi + (\omega_m + \omega_c) t)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The broadcast signal consists of the carrier wave plus two sinusoidal waves each with a frequency slightly different from &lt;math&gt;\omega_c&lt;/math&gt;, known as sidebands. For the sinusoidal signals used here, these are at &lt;math&gt;\omega_c + \omega_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_c - \omega_m&lt;/math&gt;. As long as the broadcast (carrier wave) frequencies are sufficiently spaced out so that these side bands do not overlap, stations will not interfere with one another.

===A more general example===
:''This relies on knowledge of the [[Fourier Transform]]. The discussion of the figure may prove more useful for a quicker understanding.''

Consider a general modulating signal &lt;math&gt;m(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which can now be anything at all. The same basic rules apply:
:&lt;math&gt;\,y(t) = [C + m(t)]\cos(\omega_c t)&lt;/math&gt;.
Or, in [[complex]] form:
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = [C + m(t)]\frac{e^{j\omega_c t} + e^{-j\omega_c t}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking Fourier Transforms, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;|Y(\omega)| = \pi{}C\delta(\omega - \omega_c) + \frac{1}{2}M(\omega - \omega_c) + \pi{}C\delta(\omega + \omega_c) + \frac{1}{2}M(\omega + \omega_c)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\delta(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] [[delta function]] &amp;mdash; a unit impulse at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &amp;mdash; and capital functions indicate Fourier Transforms.

This has two components: one at positive [[frequency|frequencies]] (centered on &lt;math&gt;+\omega_c&lt;/math&gt;) and one at negative frequencies (centered on &lt;math&gt;-\omega_c&lt;/math&gt;). There is nothing mathematically wrong with negative frequencies, and they need to be considered here &amp;mdash; otherwise one of the sidebands will be missing. Shown below is a graphical representation of the above equation. It shows the modulating signal's [[spectral density|spectrum]] on top, followed by the full spectrum of the modulated signal.

[[Image:AM spectrum.png|thumb|center|500px|The (2-sided) spectrum of an AM signal.]]

This makes clear the two sidebands that this modulation method yields, as well as the carrier signals that go with them. The carrier signals are the impulses. Clearly, an AM signal's spectrum consists of its original (2-sided) spectrum shifted up to the carrier frequency. The negative frequencies are a mathematical nicety, but are essential since otherwise we would be missing the lower sideband in the original spectrum!

As already mentioned, if multiple signals are to be transmitted in this way (by [[frequency division multiplexing]]), then their carrier signals must be sufficiently separated that their spectra do not overlap. This analysis also shows that the transmission bandwidth of AM is twice the signal's original ([[baseband]]) bandwidth &amp;mdash; since both the positive and negative sidebands are 'copied' up to the carrier frequency, but only the positive sideband is present originally. Thus, double-sideband AM (DS-AM) is spectrally inefficient. The various suppression methods in [[#Forms of AM|Forms of AM]], can be seen clearly in the figure &amp;mdash; with the carrier suppressed there will be no impulses and with a sideband suppressed, the transmission bandwidth is reduced back to the original, baseband, bandwidth &amp;mdash; a significant improvement in spectrum usage.

An analysis of the power consumption of AM reveals that DS-AM with its carrier has an efficiency of about 33% &amp;mdash; very poor. The forms of AM with suppressed carriers are found to be 100% power efficient, since no power is wasted on the carrier signal which conveys no information.

==Modulation index==
As with other [[modulation index|modulation indices]], in AM, this quantity, also called ''modulation depth'', indicates by how much the modulated variable varies around its 'original' level. For AM, it relates to the variations in the carrier amplitude and is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;h = \frac{\mathrm{peak\ value\ of\ } m(t)}{C}&lt;/math&gt;.
So if &lt;math&gt;h=0.5&lt;/math&gt;, the carrier amplitude varies by 50% above and below its unmodulated level, and for &lt;math&gt;h=1.0&lt;/math&gt; it varies by 100%. Modulation depth greater than 100% is generally to be avoided - practical transmitter systems will usually incorporate some kind of limiter circuit, such as a [[VOGAD]], to ensure this.

Variations of modulated signal with percentage modulation are shown below.  In each image, the maximum amplitude is higher than in the previous image.  Note that the scale changes from one image to the next.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:AM signals.svg]]&lt;/center&gt;

== Amplitude modulator designs ==
===Circuits===
A wide range of different circuits have been used for AM, but one of the simplest circuits uses anode or collector modulation applied via a [[transformer]]. While it is perfectly possible to create good designs using solid-state electronics, [[thermionic valve|valved]] (tube) circuits are shown here. In general, valves are able to easily yield RF powers far in excess of what can be achieved using solid state. Most high-power broadcast stations still use valves.

[[Image:ammodstage.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Anode modulation using a transformer.  The [[tetrode]] is supplied with an anode supply (and screen grid supply) which is modulated via the transformer. The resistor R1 sets the grid bias, both the input and outputs are tuned [[LC circuit]]s which are tapped into by inductive coupling]]

Modulation circuit designs can be broadly divided into low and high level.

=== Low level ===
Here a small [[Sound|audio]] stage is used to [[modulation|modulate]] a low power stage, the output of this stage is then amplified using a [[Linear amplifier|linear]] RF amplifier.

* Advantages

The advantage of using a linear RF amplifier is that the smaller early stages can be modulated, which only requires a small [[audio amplifier]] to drive the modulator. 

* Disadvantages

The great disadvantage of this system is that the amplifer chain is less [[electrical efficiency|efficient]], because it has to be linear to preserve the modulation. Hence [[Electronic amplifier#Class C|Class C amplifiers]] cannot be employed.

An approach which marries the advantages of low-level modulation with the efficiency of a Class C power amplifier chain is to arrange a feedback system to compensate for the substantial distortion of the AM envelope. A simple detector at the transmitter output (which can be little more than a loosely coupled [[diode]]) recovers the audio signal, and this is used as [[negative feedback]] to the audio modulator stage. The overall chain then acts as a linear amplifier as far as the actual modulation is concerned, though the RF amplifier itself still retains the Class C efficiency. This approach is widely used in practical medium power transmitters, such as AM [[radiotelephone]]s.

=== High level ===
; Advantages 

One advantage of using class C amplifiers in a broadcast AM transmitter is that only the final stage needs to be modulated, and that all the earlier stages can be driven at a constant level. These class C stages will be able to generate the drive for the final stage for a smaller [[Direct current|DC]] power input. However in many designs in order to obtain better quality AM the penultimate RF stages will need to be subject to modulation as well as the final stage.

; Disadvantages

A large audio amplifer will be needed for the modulation stage, at least equal to the power of the transmitter output itself. Traditionally the modulation is applied using an audio transformer, and this can be bulky. Direct coupling from the audio amplifier is also possible (known as a [[cascode]] arrangement), though this usually requires quite a high DC supply voltage (say 30V or more), which is not suitable for mobile units.

[[Image:Afresnel.jpg|thumb|right|Augustin Fresnel]]


'''Augustin-Jean Fresnel''' (pronounced [{{IPA|fre&amp;#618; 'nel}}] in [[American English|AmE]], [{{IPA|f&amp;#641;&amp;#603; n&amp;#603;l}}] in [[French language|French]]) ([[May 10]], [[1788]] &amp;ndash; [[July 14]], [[1827]]), was a [[France|French]] [[physics|physicist]] who contributed significantly to the establishment of the theory of [[wave|wave optics]]. Fresnel studied the behaviour of light both theoretically and experimentally. 

==Biography==

Fresnel was the son of an architect, born at [[Broglie, Eure|Broglie]] ([[Eure]]). His early progress in learning was slow, and he still could not read when  he was eight years old. At thirteen he entered the École Centrale in [[Caen]], and at sixteen and a half the [[École Polytechnique]], where he acquitted himself with distinction. From there he went to the [[École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées|École des Ponts et Chaussées]]. He served as an engineer successively in the departments of [[Vendée]], [[Drôme]] and [[Ille-et-Vilaine]]; but having supported the [[Bourbon house|Bourbons]] in [[1814]] he lost his appointment on [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] return to power.

On the second restoration of the monarchy, he obtained a post as engineer in [[Paris]], where much of his life from that time was spent. His researches in optics, continued until his death, appear to have been begun about the year [[1814]], when he prepared a paper on the [[aberration of light]], which, however, was not published. In [[1818]] he wrote a memoir on [[diffraction]] for which in the ensuing year he received the prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des Sciences]] at Paris. He was in [[1823]] unanimously elected a member of the academy, and in [[1825]] he became a member of the [[Royal Society of London]], which in [[1827]], at the time of his last illness, awarded him the [[Rumford Medal]]. In [[1819]] he was nominated a commissioner of [[lighthouse]]s, for which he was the first to construct a special type of lens, now called a [[Fresnel lens]], as substitutes for mirrors. He died of [[tuberculosis]] at [[Ville-d'Avray]], near Paris.

His labours in the cause of optical science received during his lifetime only scant public recognition, and some of his papers were not printed by the Académie des Sciences till many years after his decease. But, as he wrote to Young in [[1824]], in him &quot;that sensibility, or that vanity, which people call love of glory&quot; had been blunted. &quot;All the compliments,&quot; he says, &quot;that I have received from Arago, [[Pierre Simon, Marquis de Laplace|Laplace]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Biot|Biot]] never gave me so much pleasure as the discovery of a theoretic truth, or the confirmation of a calculation by experiment.&quot;

==Researches== 

His discoveries and mathematical deductions, building on experimental work by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], extended the [[Huygens' principle|wave theory]] of [[light]] to a large class of [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]]. 

His use of two plane mirrors of metal, forming with each other an angle of nearly 180°, allowed him to avoid the diffraction effects caused (by the apertures) in the experiment of [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|FM Grimaldi]] on [[interference]]. This allowed him to conclusively account for the phenomena of interference in accordance with the wave theory.

With [[François Arago]] he studied the laws of the interference of [[polarization|polarized]] rays. He obtained circularly polarized light by means of a rhombus of glass, known as &quot;Fresnel's rhomb&quot;, having obtuse angles of 126° and acute angles of 54°. 

He is perhaps best known as the inventor of the [[Fresnel lens]], first adopted in [[lighthouse]]s while he was a French commissioner of lighthouses, and found in many applications today.

[[Image:Abbeville_Beffroi_2005-09-29.jpg|thumb|Beffroi]]

'''Abbeville''' is a city in the [[Picardie]] ''[[Région in France|région]]'', in the north of [[France]]. 
==Location==

Abbeville is located on the [[Somme River]], 12 m. from its modern mouth in the [[English Channel]], and 28 m. northwest of [[Amiens]]. In the medieval period, it was the lowest crossing point on the Somme and it was nearby that [[Edward III of England|Edward III's]] army crossed shortly before the [[Battle of Crécy]] in [[1346]].

==Administration==

Abbeville was the chief town of the [[Provinces of France|former province]] of [[Ponthieu]]. Today, it is one of the three ''[[sous-préfecture]]s'' of the [[Somme]] ''[[département in France|département]]''.

It is twinned with the town of [[Burgess Hill]] in [[West Sussex]].

==Prehistory ==

The name Abbeville has been adopted to name a category of early stone tools. These stone tools are also known as [[handaxes]]. Various handaxes were found near Abbeville by [[Jacques Boucher de Perthes]] during the 1830's and he was the first to desribe the stones in detail, pointing out in the first publication of its kind, that the stones were chipped deliberately by early man, so as to form a tool. These earliest stone tools found in Europe were chipped on both sides so as to form a sharp edge, are now known as [[Abbevillian]] handaxes or [[bifaces]] . The earlier form of stone tools, not found in Europe is known as [[Oldewan]] choppers . A more refined and later version of handax production was also found in the Abbeville/Somme River district. The more refined handax became known as the [[Acheulean]] industry, named after [[Saint Acheul]], today a suburb of [[Amiens]] .

==History==

Abbeville first appears in history during the [[9th century]]. At that time belonging to the [[abbey]] of [[St Riquier]], it was afterwards governed by the [[Ponthieu|Counts of Ponthieu]]. Together with that county, it came into the possession of the [[Alençon]] and other French families, and afterwards into that of the house of [[Castile]], from whom by marriage it fell in [[1272]] to King [[Edward I of England]]. French and English were its masters by turns till [[1435]] when, by the [[treaty of Arras]], it was ceded to the [[Duke of Burgundy]]. In [[1477]] it was annexed by King [[Louis XI of France]], and was held by two illegitimate branches of the royal family in the 16th and 17th centuries, being in [[1696]] reunited to the crown. In 1514, the town saw the marriage of [[Louis XII of France]] to [[Mary Tudor (queen consort of France)|Mary Tudor]], the daughter of [[Henry VII of England]].

Abbeville was fairly important in the [[18th century]], when the Van Robais Royal Manufacture (one of the first major factories in France) brought great prosperity (but some class controversy) to the town.  [[Voltaire]], among others, wrote about it. He also wrote about a major incident of intolerance in which a young impoverished lord, the [[Chevalier de la Barre]], was executed there for impiety (supposedly because he did not [[salute]] a procession for [[Corpus Christi]], though the story is far more complex than that and revolves around a mutilated cross.)

==Sights==

The city was very picturesque until the early days of [[World War II]], when it was bombed mostly to rubble in one night by the Germans. The town overall is now mostly modern and rebuilt. Several of the town's attractions remain, including:
* [[Saint Wulfram|St. Vulfran]]'s church, erected in the [[15th century|15th]], [[16th century|16th]] and [[17th century|17th]] centuries. The original design was not completed. The [[nave]] has only two bays and the choir is insignificant. The facade is a magnificent specimen of the flamboyant [[Gothic style]], flanked by two Gothic towers.

It lies in a pleasant and fertile valley, and is built partly on an island and partly on both sides of the river, which is canalized from this point to the estuary.  The streets are narrow, and the houses are mostly picturesque old structures, built of wood, with many quaint gables and dark archways.  The most remarkable building is the church of St Vulfran. Abbeville has several other old churches and an [[Hotel de Ville]], with a [[belfry (architecture)|belfry]] of the [[13th century]]. Among the numerous old houses, that known as the Maison de [[Francis I of France|Francois I]], which is the most remarkable, dates from the [[16th century]]. There is a statue of [[Admiral Courbet]] (d. [[1885]]) by [[Alexandre Falguière]] in the chief square.  The public institutions include tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a board of trade-arbitrators, and a communal college.  Abbeville is an important industrial centre; in addition to its old-established manufacture of cloth, hemp-spinning, sugar-making, ship-building and [[locksmithing|locksmith]]s' work are carried on; there is active commerce in grain, but the port has little trade.

[[Image:Prepozyt.png|right|300px|thumb|Abbot's coat of arms]]
The word abbot, meaning father, has been used as a Christian clerical title in various, mainly monastic, meanings.

==Origins==
The title had its origin in the [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[Syria]], spread through the eastern [[Mediterranean]], and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the designation of the head of a monastery. Originally, the word, meaning father, was applied to various priests, e.g. at the court of the Frankish monarchy the ''Abbas palatinus'' ('of the palace') and ''Abbas castrensis'' ('of the camp) were chaplains to the Merovingian/ Carolingian sovereign's court viz. to his army.  At first it was employed as a respectful title for any monk, but it was soon restricted by canon law to certain priestly superiors.  The name &quot;abbot&quot; came in fairly general use in western [[Christian monasticism|monastic]] [[order (religious)|orders]] whose members (or the 'full' level at least) are ordained priest.  However, various congregations chose other titles for their superiors, e.g. among the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Carmelites]], [[Augustinian]]s, etc., ''Praepositus'', ''Provost'', and ''Prior''; among the [[Franciscan]]s, ''Custos,''  &quot;guardian&quot;; and by the monks of [[Camaldolese|Camaldoli]], &quot;Major.&quot; 

==Monastic History==

An '''abbot''' (from the Hebrew ''ab,'' &quot;a father&quot;, through the Syriac ''abba,'' Latin ''abbas'' (genitive form, ''abbatis''), Old English ''abbad,'' ; German ''Abt;'' French ''abbé'') is the head and chief governor of a community of [[monk]]s, called also in the East ''hegumenos'' or ''archimandrite.''  The [[English language|English]] version for a female monastic head is '''[[abbess]]'''.

In [[Egypt]], the first home of monasticism, the jurisdiction of the abbot, or archimandrite, was but loosely defined. Sometimes he ruled over only one community, sometimes over several, each of which had its own abbot as well.  [[Cassian]] speaks of an abbot of the [[Thebaid]] who had 500 monks under him. By the [[Rule of St Benedict]], which, until the reform of [[Abbey of Cluny|Cluny]], was the norm in the West, the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community. The rule, as was inevitable, was subject to frequent violations; but it was not until the foundation of the [[Abbey of Cluny|Cluniac]] Order that the idea of a supreme abbot, exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order, was definitely recognized.  

Monks, as a rule, were laymen, nor at the outset was the abbot any exception.  For the reception of the [[sacraments]], and for other religious offices, the abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church. This rule proved inconvenient when a monastery was situated in a desert or at a distance from a city, and necessity compelled the [[ordination]] of some monks.  This innovation was not introduced without a struggle, [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher [[spirituality|spiritual]] life, but, before the close of the [[5th century]], at least in the East, abbots seem almost universally to have become [[deacon]]s, if not priests.  The change spread more slowly in the West, where the office of abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the [[7th century]]. The ecclesiastical leadership exercised by abbots despite their frequent lay status is proved by their attendance and votes at ecclesiastical councils.  Thus at the [[first Council of Constantinople]], AD [[448]], 23 [[archimandrite]]s or abbots sign, with 30 [[bishop]]s.  

The [[second Council of Nicaea]], AD [[787]], recognized the right of abbots to ordain their monks to the inferior orders below the [[deacon|diaconate]], a power usually reserved to bishops.

Abbots were originally subject to [[bishop|episcopal]] jurisdiction, and continued generally so, in fact, in the West till the 11th century.  The [[Code of Justinian]] (lib. i. tit. iii. de Ep. leg. xl.) expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight. The first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of Faustus, abbot of Lerins, at the council of Arles, AD [[456]]; but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops, to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced, far more than to the arrogance of abbots, rendered it increasingly frequent, and, in the 6th century, the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control, and making them responsible to the pope alone, received an impulse from [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]. These exceptions, introduced with a good object, had grown into a widespread evil by the 12th century, virtually creating an ''imperium in imperio,'' and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his [[diocese]]. In the 12th century the abbots of Fulda claimed precedence of the [[archbishopric of Cologne|archbishop of Cologne]].  Abbots more and more assumed almost episcopal state, and in defiance of the prohibition of early councils and the protests of St Bernard and others, adopted the episcopal insignia of [[mitre]], ring, gloves and sandals.  It has been maintained that the right to wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the 11th century, but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine (J. Braun, ''Liturgische Gewandung'', p. 453).  The first undoubted instance is the bull by which [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]] in [[1063]] granted the use of the mitre to Egelsinus, abbot of the monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury. The '''mitred abbots''' in England were those of [[Abingdon, England|Abingdon]], [[St Albans Abbey|St Alban's]], Bardney, Battle, [[Bury St. Edmunds Abbey|Bury St Edmund's]], St Augustine's Canterbury, Colchester, [[Croyland]], [[Evesham, Worcestershire|Evesham]], [[Glastonbury]], [[Gloucester]], St Benet's Hulme, Hyde, [[Malmesbury]], [[Peterborough]], [[Ramsey]], [[Reading Abbey|Reading]], [[Selby]], [[Shrewsbury]], [[Tavistock]], [[Thorney]], [[Westminster]], [[Winchcombe]], St Mary's [[York]].  Of these the precedence was originally yielded to the abbot of Glastonbury, until in AD [[1154]] [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]] (Nicholas Breakspear) granted it to the abbot of St Alban's, in which monastery he had been brought up.  Next after the abbot of St Alban's ranked the abbot of Westminster.  To distinguish abbots from bishops, it was ordained that their mitre should be made of less costly materials, and should not be ornamented with gold, a rule which was soon entirely disregarded, and that the crook of their [[crosier|pastoral staff]] should turn inwards instead of outwards, indicating that their jurisdiction was limited to their own house. 

The adoption of certain episcopal insignia ([[pontificalia]]) by abbots was followed by an encroachment on episcopal functions, which had to be specially but ineffectually guarded against by the [[First Council of the Lateran|Lateran council]], AD [[1123]].  In the East, abbots, if in priests' orders, with the consent of the bishop, were, as we have seen, permitted by the [[Second Council of Nicaea|second Nicene council]], AD [[787]], to confer the [[tonsure]] and admit to the order of reader; but gradually abbots, in the West also, advanced higher claims, until we find them in AD [[1489]] permitted by [[Pope Innocent IV|Innocent IV]] to confer both the subdiaconate and diaconate.  Of course, they always and everywhere had the power of admitting their own monks and vesting them with the religious habit.

When a vacancy occurred, the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the [[abbey|convent]], but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot.  In [[abbey]]s exempt from the (arch)bishop's diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and [[benediction]] had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot's journey to [[Rome]].  It was necessary that an abbot should be at least 25 years of age, of legitimate birth, a monk of the house, unless it furnished no suitable candidate, when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct others, one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience. In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor. Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later times we have another example in the case of St Bruno.  Popes and sovereigns gradually encroached on the rights of the monks, until in Italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontre and other houses, chiefs of their order.  The election was for life, unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the pope or the bishop.  

The ceremony of the formal admission of a [[Benedictine]] abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by the [[consuetudinary]] of Abingdon.  The newly elected abbot was to put off his shoes at the door of the church, and proceed barefoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a procession.  After proceeding up the [[nave]], he was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir, into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his [[commissary]], and placed in his stall.  The monks, then kneeling, gave him the kiss of peace on the hand, and rising, on the mouth, the abbot holding his [[staff of office]].  He then put on his shoes in the [[vestry]], and a [[chapter (religion)|chapter]] was held, and the bishop or his delegate preached a suitable sermon. 

The power of the abbot was paternal but absolute, limited, however, by the [[canon law]].  One of the main goals of monasticism was the purgation of self and selfishness, and obedience was seen as a path to that perfection.  It was sacred duty to execute the abbot's orders, and even to act without his orders was sometimes considered a transgression.  Examples among the Egyptian monks of this submission to the commands of the superiors, exalted into a virtue by those who regarded the entire crushing of the individual will as a goal, are detailed by Cassian and others, e.g. a monk watering a dry stick, day after day, for months, or endeavouring to remove a huge rock immensely exceeding his powers.

==General Information==

Before the late modern era, the abbot was treated with the utmost reverence by the brethren of his house.  When he appeared either in church or chapter all present rose and bowed.  His letters were received kneeling, as were those of the pope and the king.  No monk might sit in his presence, or leave it without his permission, reflecting the hierarchical etiquette of families and society.  The highest place was assigned to him, both in church and at table.  In the East he was commanded to eat with the other monks.  In the West the [[Rule of St Benedict]] appointed him a separate table, at which he might entertain guests and strangers.  This permission opening the door to luxurious living, the council of Aachen, AD [[817]], decreed that the abbot should dine in the [[refectory]], and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks, unless he had to entertain a guest. These ordinances proved, however, generally ineffectual to secure strictness of diet, and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots.  When the abbot condescended to dine in the refectory, his [[chaplain]]s waited upon him with the dishes, a servant, if necessary, assisting them. When abbots dined in their own private hall, the Rule of St Benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table, provided there was room, on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels, slanderous talk and idle gossiping. 

The ordinary attire of the abbot was according to rule to be the same as that of the monks. But by the 10th century the rule was commonly set aside, and we find frequent complaints of abbots dressing in silk, and adopting sumptuous attire.  They sometimes even laid aside the monastic habit altogether, and assumed a secular dress. With the increase of wealth and power, abbots had lost much of their special religious character, and become great lords, chiefly distinguished from lay lords by [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]].  Thus we hear of abbots going out to hunt, with their men carrying bows and arrows; keeping horses, dogs and huntsmen; and special mention is made of an abbot of [[Leicester]], c. [[1360]], who was the most skilled of all the nobility in hare hunting.  In magnificence of equipage and [[retinue]] the abbots vied with the first nobles of the realm.  They rode on mules with gilded bridles, rich saddles and housings, carrying hawks on their wrist, followed by an immense train of attendants.  The bells of the churches were rung as they passed.  They associated on equal terms with laymen of the highest distinction, and shared all their pleasures and pursuits.  This rank and power was, however, often used most beneficially.  For instance, we read of Whiting, the last abbot of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], judicially murdered by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], that his house was a kind of well-ordered court, where as many as 300 sons of noblemen and gentlemen, who had been sent to him for virtuous education, had been brought up, besides others of a lesser rank, whom he fitted for the universities. His table, attendance and officers were an honour to the nation. He would entertain as many as 500 persons of rank at one time, besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a week. He had his country houses and fisheries, and when he travelled to attend parliament his retinue amounted to upwards of 100 persons.  The abbots of [[Cluny]] and [[Vendome|Vendôme]] were, by virtue of their office, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s of the Roman church. 

In process of time the title abbot was extended to [[clergy#Catholic clergy|clerics]] who had no connection with the monastic system, as to the principal of a body of parochial clergy; and 
under the [[Charlemagne|Carolingians]] to the chief chaplain of the king, ''Abbas Curiae,'' or military chaplain of the emperor, ''Abbas Castrensis.'' It even came to be adopted by purely secular officials.  Thus the chief magistrate of the republic at [[Genoa]] was called ''Abbas Populi''.

[[Lay abbot]]s (M. Lat. ''defensores'', ''abbacomites'', ''abbates laici'', ''abbates milites'', ''abbates saeculares'' or ''irreligiosi'', ''abbatiarii'', or sometimes simply ''abbates'') were the outcome of the growth of the [[Feudalism | feudal]] system from the [[8th century]] onwards.  The practice of [[commendation]], by which--to meet a contemporary emergency--the revenues of the community were handed over to a lay lord, in return for his protection, 
early suggested to the emperors and kings the expedient of rewarding their warriors with rich abbeys held ''in [[commendam]].''

During the Carolingian epoch the custom grew up of granting these as regular heritable [[fiefdom|fiefs]] or [[benefice]]s, and by the [[10th century]], before the great [[Cluny | Cluniac]] reform, the system was firmly established. Even the [[Saint Denis Basilica|abbey of St Denis]] was held in commendam by [[Hugh Capet]]. The example of the kings was followed by the feudal nobles, sometimes by making a temporary concession permanent, sometimes without any form of commendation whatever.  In England the abuse was rife in the 8th century, as may be gathered from the acts of the council of Cloveshoe.  These lay abbacies were not merely a question of 
overlordship, but implied the concentration in lay hands of all the rights, immunities and jurisdiction of the foundations, i.e. the more or less complete secularization of spiritual institutions.  The lay abbot took his recognized rank in the feudal hierarchy, and was free to dispose of his fief as in the case of any other.  The enfeoffment of abbeys differed in form and degree.  Sometimes the monks were directly subject to the lay abbot; sometimes he appointed a 
substitute to perform the spiritual functions, known usually as [[dean (religion)|dean]] (decanus), but also as abbot (''abbas legitimas'', ''monasticus'', ''regularis''). When the great reform of the 11th century had put an end to the direct jurisdiction of the lay abbots, the honorary title of abbot continued to be held by certain of the great feudal famines, as late as the 13th century and later, the actual head of the community retaining that of dean.  The connection of the lesser lay abbots with the abbeys, especially in the south of France, lasted longer; and certain feudal families retained the title of abbes chevaliers (abbates milltes) for centuries, together with certain rights over the abbey lands or revenues. The abuse was not confined to the West.  John, [[patriarch of Antioch]], at the beginning of the 12th Century, informs us that in his time most monasteries had been handed over to laymen, ''bencficiarii,'' for life, or for part of their lives, by the emperors.

[[Giraldus Cambrensis]] reported (''Itinerary'', ii.iv) the common customs of lay abbots in the late 12th-century Church of Wales:
:&quot;for a bad custom has prevailed amongst the clergy, of appointing the most powerful people of a parish stewards, or, rather, patrons, of their churches; who, in process of time, from a desire of gain, have usurped the whole right, appropriating to their own use the possession of all the lands, leaving only to the clergy the altars, with their tenths and oblations, and assigning even these to their sons and relations in the church. Such defenders, or rather destroyers, of the church, have caused themselves to be called abbots, and presumed to attribute to themselves a title, as well as estates, to which they have no just claim.&quot;  

In conventual cathedrals, where the bishop occupied the place of the abbot, the functions usually devolving on the superior of the monastery were performed by a prior.

==Abbatial hierarchy==
In several orders, there exists a pyramidal relationship between a major abbey (often the old mother of several others, especially if it was the place from where a monastic reform was launched, which in other cases even lead to breaking away as a new order of congregation) and other ones (often younger daughters), even when these are not (or no longer) [[priories]] but have their own abbot. 
As a daughter could often become a mother in a next phase, the 'family tree' can become very complex, but often the grandmother remains the only one with acknowledged seniority.(because she is old ...)

Sometimes a very real hold was maintained, so the Abbot of [[Abbey of Cluny|Cluny]] had such vast income from the network of filial monasteries that he was one of the most powerful men in the church, and a real [[papabile]]. In other cases the precedence is little more than a honorary status.

In several cases, the senior abbot is entitled to '''a specific style''', such as [[Abbot general]], [[abbot president]], [[abbot primate]] and [[archabbot]]. 
Such titles may also apply to the presidents of federation of monasteries, not necessarily reserved for one abbey.

==Modern Abbots not as Superior== 
The title [[abbé]] (French; Ital. ''abbate''), as commonly used in the Catholic church on the European continent, is the equivalent of the English &quot;Father&quot; (parallel etymology), being loosely applied to all who have received the [[tonsure]].  This use of the title is said to have originated in the right conceded to the king of France, by the [[concordat]] between [[Pope Leo X]] and [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1516), to appoint ''abbes commendataires'' to most of the abbeys in France.  The expectation of obtaining these [[sinecure]]s drew young men towards the church in considerable numbers, and the class of abbés so formed--''abbes de cour'' they were sometimes called, and sometimes (ironically) ''abbes de sainte esperance'', abbés of St Hope--came to hold a recognized position.  The connection many of them had with the church was of the slenderest kind, consisting mainly in adopting the name of abbe, after a remarkably moderate course of theological study, practising [[celibacy]] and wearing a distinctive dress--a short dark-violet coat with narrow collar.  Being men of presumed learning and undoubted leisure, many of the class found admission to the houses of the French nobility as tutors or advisers. Nearly every great family had its abbé. The class did not survive the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]; but the [[courtesy title]] of abbé, having long lost all connection in people's minds with any special ecclesiastical function, remained as a convenient general term applicable to any clergyman. 

==Protestant abbots==
In the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|German Evangelical Church]] the German title of ''Abt'' (abbot) is sometimes bestowed, like the French ''abbé'', as an honorary distinction, and survives to designate the heads of some monasteries converted at the Reformation into collegiate foundations. 
Of these the most noteworthy is the abbey of Lokkum in [[Hanover]], founded as a [[Cistercian]] house in 1163 by Count Wilbrand of Hallermund, and reformed in 1593. The abbot of Lokkum, who still carries a pastoral staff, takes precedence of all the clergy of Hanover, and was ''ex officio'' a member of the [[consistory]] of the kingdom.  The governing body of the abbey consists of the abbot, prior and the &quot;convent&quot; of ''[[Stiftsherr]]en'' (canons).

In the [[Church of England]], the [[Bishop of Norwich]], by royal decree given by [[Henry VIII]], also holds the honorary title of &quot;Abbot of St. Benēt.&quot;  This title hails back to England's separation from Rome, when King Henry, as supreme head of the newly independent church, took over all of the monastaries, mainly for their possessions, except for St. Benēt, which he spared because the abbot and his monks possesed no wealth, and lived like simple beggers, disposing the incumbent Bishop of Norwich and seating the abbot in his place, thus the dual title still held to this day.

'''''Ardipithecus''''' is a very early [[hominin]] [[genus]] ([[subfamily]] [[Homininae]]). Because it shares several traits with the African [[great ape]]s (genus ''[[chimpanzee|Pan]]'' and genus ''[[Gorilla]]''), it is considered by some to be on the [[chimpanzee]] rather than [[human]] branch, but most consider it a [[proto-human]] because of a likeness in teeth with ''[[Australopithecus]]''. ''A. ramidus'' lived about 5.4 and 4.2 million years ago during the early [[Pliocene]].

Two [[species]] have been described, ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' and ''Ardipithecus kadabba''. The latter was initially described as a [[subspecies]] of ''A. ramidus'', but on the basis of teeth recently discovered in [[Ethiopia]] has been raised to species rank. ''A. kadabba'' is dated to have lived between 5.8 million to 5.2 million years ago. The [[canine teeth]] show primitive features that distinguish them from those of more recent hominines. ''A. kadabba'' is believed to be the earliest organism yet identified that lies in the human line following its split from the lineage that gave rise to the two modern chimpanzee species.

On the basis of bone sizes, ''Ardipithecus'' species are believed to have been about the size of a modern chimpanzee. The toe structure of ''A. ramidus'' suggests that the creature walked upright, and this poses problems for current theories of the origins of hominid [[bipedalism]]: ''Ardipithecus'' is believed to have lived in shady forests rather than on the savannah, where the faster running permitted by bipedalism would have been an advantage.

The forest lifestyle poses problems for the current theories regarding the development of bipedalism, most of which focus on the savanna. New thought will be necessary in order to reconcile these savanna theories with the current knowledge of early forest-dwelling hominids.

      <comment>/* History of the assembly line */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''assembly line''' is a [[manufacturing]] process in which interchangeable parts are added to a product in a sequential manner to create an end product.    

==History of the assembly line==   

Until the 19th century, a single craftsman or team of craftsmen would create each part of a product individually, and assemble them together into a single item, making changes in the parts so that they would fit together - the so-called [[English System]] of manufacture.

[[Eli Whitney]] developed the [[American system of manufacturing|American System]] of manufacturing in 1799, using the ideas of ''[[division of labor]]'' and of ''[[Tolerance (engineering)|engineering tolerance]]'', to create assemblies from parts in a repeatable manner.

[[Ransom Eli Olds]] patented the first assembly line concept which he put to work in his Olds Motor Vehicle Company factory in 1901, becoming the first company in America to mass-produce automobiles.

By contrast, [[Henry Ford]] is often credited with the invention of the assembly line but in actuality only applied the idea of using the [[conveyer belt]] to Olds' idea of the assembly line.

==Sociological problems with the assembly line==

In early industrial times, the assembly line ran smoothly, but as competition increased, the workers had to work faster and longer hours, therefore increasing the rate at which workplace injuries occurred.

Many workers were unhappy with the assembly line, because most never had the satisfaction of seeing the finished product (in [[Sociology|sociological]] terms, they felt [[Alienation|alienated]] from the product of their work), and they were also frustrated with the unsafe, exhausting working conditions. Because workers had to stand in the same place for hours and repeat the same motion hundreds of times per day, they often suffered from what are now called [[Repetitive strain injury|repetitive stress injuries]].

'''Adelaide''' is the [[List of Australian capital cities|capital]] and most populous city of the [[Australia]]n [[States and territories of Australia|state]] of [[South Australia]], and is the fifth largest city in Australia with a population of over 1.1 million. Adelaide is a coastal city beside the [[Southern Ocean]] and is situated on the [[Adelaide Plains]], north of the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]], between the [[Gulf Saint Vincent|Gulf St. Vincent]] and the low lying [[Mount Lofty Ranges]]. It is a roughly [[linear city]] 20 km from the coast to the foothills, but stretches 90 km from [[Gawler, South Australia|Gawler]] at its northern extent to [[Aldinga, South Australia|Aldinga]] in the south. 

Named in honour of [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]], the [[consort]] of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]], the city was founded in [[1836]] as the [[new town|planned capital]] for the only freely-settled British [[province]] established in Australia. [[William Light|Colonel William Light]], one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city and chose its location close to the [[River Torrens]]. Inspired by [[William Penn]] and the [[garden city movement]], Light's design set Adelaide out in a grid layout, interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by [[Adelaide Parklands|parkland]]. Early Adelaide was shaped by religious freedom and a commitment to political [[progressivism]] and civil liberties which led to world-first reforms. Adelaidean society remained largely [[puritan]] up until the 1970s, when a set of social reforms under the [[Premier of South Australia|premiership]] of [[Don Dunstan]] resulted in a cultural revival. Today Adelaide is known for its many [[:Category:Festivals in Adelaide|festivals]] as well as for its wine, arts and sports.

As South Australia's seat of government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the city centre along the cultural boulevard of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] and in various districts of the metropolitan area. 

==History==
{{Main|History of Adelaide}}

Prior to European settlement, the Adelaide area was inhabited by the [[Kaurna]] [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] tribe. Acknowledged Kaurna country comprised the Adelaide Plains and surrounding regions - from [[Cape Jervis]] in the south, and to [[Port Wakefield, South Australia|Port Wakefield]] in the north. Among their unique customs were burn-offs (controlled [[bushfires]]) in the Adelaide Hills which the early Europeans spotted before the Kaurna people were pushed out by settlement. By 1852, the total population (by census count) of the Kaurna was 650 in the Adelaide region and steadily decreasing. During the winter months, they moved into the [[Adelaide hills]] for better shelter and firewood. {{ref|cathuni}} {{ref|placenames}} 
[[Image:Adelaide North Tce 1839.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Adelaide in [[1839]], looking south-east from [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]]]]
South Australia was officially settled as a new [[United Kingdom|British]] [[province]] on [[December 28]], [[1836]]. This day is now commemorated as a [[public holiday]], [[Proclamation Day]] in South Australia.  The site of the colonies capital city was surveyed and laid-out by Colonel [[William Light]], the first Surveyor-General of South Australia. Light chose, not without opposition, a site on rising ground close to the [[River Torrens]], which became the chief early water supply for the fledgling colony. &quot;[[Light's Vision]]&quot;, as it has been termed, has meant that the initial design of Adelaide required little modification as the city grew and prospered.  Usually in an older city, it would be necessary to accommodate larger roads and add parks, whereas Adelaide had them from the start. Adelaide was established as the centre of a [[New town|planned colony]] of free immigrants, promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution and as such does not share the [[convict]] settlement history of other Australian cities, like [[Sydney]] and [[Hobart]].

Adelaide's early history was wrought by economic uncertainty and incompetent leadership. The first governor of South Australia, [[John Hindmarsh|Hindmarsh]], clashed frequently with Col Light. The rural area surrounding Adelaide city was surveyed by Light in preparation to sell, a total of over 405 km² of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from [[New South Wales]] and [[Tasmania]]. The wool industry served as a early basis for the South Australian economy. Light's survey was completed in this period, and land was promptly offered to sale to early colonists. Wheat farms ranged from [[Encounter Bay]] in the south to [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]] in the north by 1860. [[George Gawler|Governor Gawler]] took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, [[gaol]], police barracks, hospital, and customs house and a wharf at [[Port Adelaide]]. In addition houses for public officials and missionaries, and outstations for police and surveyors were also constructed during Gawler's governorship. Adelaide had also become economically self-sufficent during this period but at heavy cost: the colony was heavily in [[debt]] and relied on bail-outs from London to stay afloat. Gawler was recalled and replaced by [[George Edward Grey|Governor Grey]] in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, yet its impact was negligible at this point: Silver was discovered in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] that year, agricultural industries were well underway and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.
[[Image:Adelaide town hall 1950.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Adelaide General Post Office in 1950]]
Trade links with the rest of the Australian states were established with the navigation of the [[Murray River]] being successfully navigated in 1853 by Francis Cadell, an Adelaide resident. Adelaide saw South Australia become a [[Self-governing colony]] in 1856 with the [[ratification]] of a new [[constitution]] by the British parliament. [[Secret ballot]]s were introduced, and a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament was elected on 9 March 1857, by which time 109 917 people lived in the province. In 1860 the Thorndon Park reservoir was opened, finally providing an alternative water source to the [[Turbidity|turbid]] River Torrens. In 1867 gas [[street light]]ing was implemented, the [[University of Adelaide]] was founded in 1874, the [[South Australian Art Gallery]] opened in 1881 and the [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] opened in 1896. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]], ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in [[Melbourne]] and banks in [[Sydney]] closed. The national [[fertility rate]] fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. [[Drought]] and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems with some families leaving for [[Western Australia]]. Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and [[lead]] discoveries at [[Broken Hill]] provided some relief.
Only one year of [[deficit]] was recorded but the price paid was retrenchments and lean public spending. [[Wine]] and copper were the only industries not to suffer a downturn.

Electric street lighting was introduced in 1900 and electric [[tram]]s were transporting passengers in 1909. 28 000 men were sent to fight in [[World War I]]. Adelaide enjoyed a post-war boom but with the return of droughts, entered the [[Great Depression|depression]] of the 1930s, later returning to prosperity with strong government leadership. [[Secondary sector of industry|Secondary industries]] helped reduce the state's dependence on [[primary sector of industry|primary industries]]. The 1933 census recorded the state population at 580 949 which was less of an increase than other states due to the state's economic limitations. [[World War II]] brought industrial stimulus and diversification to Adelaide under the [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford]] Government, which advocated Adelaide as a safe place for manufacturing due to its less vulrenable location. 70 000 men and women enlisted and shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of [[Whyalla, South Australia|Whyalla]]. 

[[Image:Rundle Mall.jpg|280px|thumb|left|Rundle Mall circa 1988 with the famous ''Spheres'' sculpture (colloquially ''Mall's Balls'') clearly visible.]]
The South Australian Government in this period built on former wartime manufacturing industries. International manufacturers like General Motors [[Holden]] and Chrysler make use of these factories around Adelaide completing its transformation from an agricultural service centre to a twentieth century city. A pipeline from [[Mannum, South Australia|Mannum]] brought [[River Murray]] water to Adelaide in 1954 and an [[airport]] opened at [[West Beach, South Australia|West Beach]] in 1955. An assisted migration scheme brought 215,000 immigrants of all nationalities to South Australia between 1947 and 1973. The Dunstan Government in the 1970s saw something of an Adelaide 'cultural revival' - establishing a wide array of social reforms and overseeing the city becoming a centre of the arts. Adelaide hosted the [[Australian Grand Prix]] between 1985 and 1996 on a street circuit in the city's east parklands, before losing it in a controversial move to [[Melbourne]]. The 1992 [[State Bank of South Australia|State Bank]] collapse plunged both Adelaide and South Australia into economic recession, and its effects can still be felt today. Recent years have seen the [[Clipsal 500]] [[V8 Supercar]] race make use of the former Formula One circuit and renewed economic confidence under the [[Mike Rann|Rann]] Government.

==Geography==
[[Image:Satellite_image_of_Adelaide_South_Australia.jpg|right|frame|Satellite image of Adelaide]]
Adelaide is located north of the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]], on the Adelaide plains between the [[Gulf Saint Vincent|Gulf St Vincent]] and the low lying [[Mount Lofty Ranges]]. The city stretches from the town of [[Gawler, South Australia|Gawler]] at its most northern, to [[Aldinga, South Australia|Aldinga]] in the south. According to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], the Adelaide Metropolitan Region has a total land area of 870 km², which is at an average elevation of 50 metres above sea level. [[Mount Lofty]] is located east of the Adelaide metropolitan region in the [[Adelaide Hills]] at an elevation of 727 metres. It is the tallest point in its [[Mount Lofty Ranges|namesake]] range.

Much of Adelaide was originally bushland before European settlement, with some variation - swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast. However, much of the original vegetation has been cleared with the remainder remaining in reserves such as the [[Adelaide Parklands]], [[Cleland Conservation Park]] and [[Belair National Park]]. A number of creeks and rivers flow through the Adelaide region. The largest are the [[River Torrens|Torrens]] and [[Onkaparinga River National Park|Onkaparinga]] catchments. Adelaide  relies on its many reservoirs for water supply, with [[Mount Bold Reservoir]] and [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] together supplying around 50% of Adelaide's requirements.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Adelaide}}
Adelaide has a [[Mediterranean climate]], where most of the rain falls in the winter months. Of the Australian capital cities, Adelaide is the driest. Rainfall is unreliable, light and infrequent throughout summer. In contrast, the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80 mm. [[Frost]]s are rare, with the most notable occurrences having occurred in July 1908 and July 1982.  There is usually no appreciable [[snow|snowfall]], except at [[Mount Lofty]] and some places in the [[Adelaide Hills]].

===Urban Layout===
{{Main|Light's Vision}}
[[Image:Karte_Adelaide_MKL1888.png|thumb|136px|right|1888 Map of Adelaide, showing the gradual development of its urban layout]]
Adelaide is a planned city, designed by the first surveyor-general of South Australia, Colonel [[William Light]]. His plan, now known as '''Light's Vision''', arranged Adelaide in a grid, with five squares in the inner City of Adelaide and a ring of parks known as the [[Adelaide Parklands]] surrounding it. Light's design was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first Governor, [[John Hindmarsh]]. Light persisted with his design against this initial opposition. The benefits of Light's design are numerous; Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily-navigable grid layout and a beautiful green ring around the city center. There are two sets of 'ring roads' in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The inner ring route borders the parklands and the outer route completely bypasses the inner city through (in clockwise order) [[Grand Junction Road]], Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, [[Portrush Road]], Cross Road and [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]]. {{ref|ringroute}}

The inevitable urban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous satellite cities were built in the latter half of the 20th century notably [[Salisbury, South Australia|Salisbury]] and [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]] on the city's northern fringes, which have now been enveloped by its [[urban sprawl]]. New developments in the [[Adelaide Hills]] region facilitated the construction of the [[South Eastern Freeway]] to cope with growth. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's [[City of Onkaparinga|South]] made the construction of the [[Southern Expressway]] a necessity. New roads have not only been used to cope with the urban growth, however - the [[Adelaide O-Bahn]] is an example of a unique solution to [[Tea Tree Gully, South Australia|Tea Tree Gully's]] transport woes in the 1980's.{{ref|ozroads}} The development of the nearby suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]] in the late [[1980s]] is possibly an example of well-though-out urban planning. The newer urban areas as a whole, however, are not as integrated into the urban layout as much as older areas, and therefore place more stress on Adelaide's transportation system - although not on a level comparable with [[Melbourne]] or [[Sydney]].

The historic [[Adelaide Oval]] is visible in the centre foreground.&lt;/div&gt;]]

==Governance==
{{Main|Government of South Australia}}
[[Image:Adelaide_parliament_house.JPG|right|thumb|280px|[[Parliament House, Adelaide]] on [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] houses the [[Parliament of South Australia]].]]
The [[City of Adelaide]] is responsible only for the &quot;Square Mile&quot;, which is the [[central business district]] (CBD), [[North Adelaide]] and the surrounding [[Adelaide Parklands]]. It is the oldest [[municipal]] authority in Australia and was established in 1840, when Adelaide and Australia's first mayor, [[James Hurtle Fisher]], was elected. From 1919 onwards, the City has had a [[List of Mayors and Lord Mayors of Adelaide|Lord Mayor]], the current being Lord Mayor [[Michael Harbison]]. The City of Adelaide has a population of approximately 18,000 people in an area of 15.57 km². The population of the [[inner city]] has dwindled from its peak of about 250,000 as the metropolitan area has expanded. The entire metropolitan region, including the city proper, has a population of 1,080,990 people (2001 census) in an area of 870km², and is divided into 18 autonomous [[local government areas]]. However, as South Australia's capital and most populous city, the State Government co-operates extensively with the City of Adelaide - a relationship manifest in the Capital City Committee {{ref|capcity}}, which is primarily concerned with the planning of Adelaide's urban development and growth.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Rundle Mall.JPG|right|thumb|280px|Rundle Mall- Adelaide's main shopping street]]
[[Image:Adelaide City Torrens.JPG|right|thumb|280px|Adelaide skyline from the [[River Torrens]]]]
As of [[June 2004]], Adelaide had a metropolitan population of more than 1,124,315, making it Australia's fifth largest city. In the 2002-2003 period the population grew by 0.6%, while the national average was 1.2%. Some 70.3% of the population of South Australia is resident within the metropolitan area, making South Australia one of the most centralised states. Major areas of population growth in recent years were in outer suburbs such as [[Mawson Lakes, South Australia|Mawson Lakes]] and [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]]. Adelaide's inhabitants occupy 325,000 houses, 57,000 detached, row terrace or town houses and 49,000 flats, apartments and caravans.

Major areas of population growth in recent years were in outer suburbs such as [[Mawson Lakes, South Australia|Mawson Lakes]] and [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]].   Overseas born Adelaideans composed 24.6% (242, 092) of the total population. The North-Eastern Suburbs (such as Golden Grove and [[Salisbury, South Australia|Salisbury]]) and suburbs close to the CBD had a higher ratio of overseas born residents. Wealthier and more well-educated Adelaideans are concentrated on the coastal suburbs (such as [[Brighton, South Australia|Brighton]] and [[Hallett Cove, South Australia|Hallett Cove]]) and South-Eastern suburbs (such as [[Burnside, South Australia|Burnside]] and [[Waterfall Gully, South Australia|Waterfall Gully]]). Almost a fifth (17.9%) of the population had university qualifications. The number of Adelaideans with vocational qualifications (such as tradespersons) fell from 62.1% of the labour force in the 1991 census to 52.4% in the 2001 census.

Overall, Adelaide is ageing much more rapidly than other Australian capital cities. Just under a quarter (24.1%) of Adelaide's population is aged 55 years or older, in comparison to the national average of 19.9%. To further compound the situation, Adelaide has the lowest number of children (under-15 year olds), which composed 18.7% of the population, compared to the national average of 20.4%. In regards to three highest ancestries, 38% of the population identified themselves as [[English people|English]], 34% as Australian (which is most likely primarily of [[Anglo-Celtic]] background) and 8.4% as [[Irish people|Irish]]. The three most-spoken languages other than [[Australian English|English]] were: 3.5% for [[Italian Language|Italian]], 2.3% for [[Greek Language|Greek]] and 1.2% for [[Vietnamese Language|Vietnamese]]. {{ref|adelabsstats}}

==Economy==
Adelaide's economy is primarily based around manufacturing, defence technology and research, commodity export and corresponding service industries. It has large [[manufacturing]], [[Defense (military)|defence]] and [[research]] [[Zoning|zones]]. They contain car manufacturing plants for [[Holden|General Motors Holden]] and [[Mitsubishi Motors Corporation|Mitsubishi]], and plants for medical equipment and [[electronic component]] production. Almost half of all cars produced in Australia are made in Adelaide.{{ref|carmanufacture}} The global media conglomerate [[News Corporation]] was founded in and until 2004 incorporated in Adelaide and is still considered its 'spiritual' home by [[Rupert Murdoch]]. Australia's largest oil company, [[Santos Limited|Santos]] (South Australia Northern Territory Oil Search) and the prominent South Australian brewery, [[Coopers Brewery|Coopers]] calls Adelaide their home. The collapse of the [[State Bank of South Australia|State Bank]] in 1992 resulted in large levels of state [[Public debt|debt]] (as much as A$4 billion). The collapse had meant that successive governments had enacted lean budgets, cutting [[Public finance|spending]], which had been a setback to the further [[Economic development|development]] of the city and state. The debt has recently been reduced with the State Government once again receiving a AAA+ Credit Rating.{{ref|creditrating}} The South Australian economy (very closely tied to Adelaide's) still enjoys a trade surplus and has higher per capita growth than Australia as a whole. {{ref|growth}}
[[Image:HMAS Rankin SSK-78.jpg|left|thumb|280px|The Adelaide-built [[Collins class submarine|Collins Class]] submarine HMAS Rankin]]
Adelaide is home to a large proportion of Australia's defence industries which contribute over AUD$1 billion to South Australia's Gross State Product. 70% of Australian defence companies are located in Adelaide. The principal government military research institution, the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]], and other defence technology organisations such as [[Tenix Defence Systems|Tenix]] are located in [[Salisbury, South Australia|Salisbury]] near [[RAAF Base Edinburgh]] and others near [[Technology Park, Adelaide|Technology Park]]. The [[Australian Submarine Corporation]], based in the industrial suburb of [[Osborne, South Australia|Osborne]] was charged with constructing Australia's [[Collins class submarine|Collins Class]] [[Submarines]] and recently won a AUD$6 billion contract to construct the [[Royal Australian Navy|Royal Australian Navy's]] new air-warfare destroyers. {{ref|defencestate}}

There are 466 829 employed people in Adelaide, with 62.3% employed full-time and 35.1% employed part-time. In recent years there has been a growing trend towards part-time (which includes casual) employment, increasing from only 11.6% of the workplace in 1991, to over a third today. 15% of workers are employed in manufacturing, 5% in construction, 15% in retail trade, 11% in business services, 7% in education and 12% in health and community services. The median weekly individual income for people aged 15 years and over is $300-$399 per week. The median family income is $800-$999 per week.{{ref|adelabsstats}} Adelaide's housing and living costs are substantially lower than that of other Australian cities, with housing being notably cheaper.

==Education==

Adelaide is home to campuses of all three of South Australia's universities. The [[University of Adelaide]] is a member of the [[Group of Eight (Australian universities)|Group of Eight]] and was founded in 1874, making it the third oldest university in Australia. It has five campuses in the Adelaide area; one being its primary campus on [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] and another being the [[National Wine Centre of Australia|National Wine Centre]]. The [[University of South Australia]] was formed in 1991 from a merger between the South Australian Institute of Technology and the South Australian Colleges of Advanced Education. Four of its six campuses are located in Adelaide, with two in the CBD itself. [[Flinders University]], located in [[Bedford Park, South Australia|Bedford Park]] is named after British navigator and explorer [[Matthew Flinders]] and was founded in 1966. It is a mid-sized institution with a medical school at the adjacent [[Flinders Medical Centre]]. Leading US private university, [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]], is to establish two Adelaide campuses offering both Australian and US [[Academic degree|degrees]] in 2006. The Heinz School will specialise in [[Information technology|IT]] and government management and be based in [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]], while another campus at [[Light Square, Adelaide|Light Square]] will specialise in new media and entertainment . These institutions attract students from across Australia and around the world, earning Adelaide’s international recognition as a [http://www.adelaide.sa.gov.au/council/publications/Brochures/IAEC_Adelaide_brochure_web.pdf &amp;#8216;City of Education&amp;#8217;].

School education in Adelaide is provided by a variety of public and private schools, which are the responsibility of the State Government. These schools operate under the [[South Australian Certificate of Education]] (SACE), with [[International Baccalaureate]]s (IB) offered at many as well. The [[Tertiary education|Tertiary Education]] system in Adelaide is extensive, with five out of eight centres of [[TAFE South Australia]] in the city itself, including the Douglas Mawson institute of Technology. They specialise in non-university higher education offering a viable alternative.

==Culture==

Adelaide is sometimes referred to as the 'City of Churches', although this is a reflection more on Adelaide's past than its present. Rumour has it that for every church that was built in Adelaide, a [[public house|pub]] was also built to serve the less pious. From its earliest, Adelaide attracted [[immigrant|immigrants]] from many countries, particularly German migrants escaping religious persecution. They brought with them the [[vine]] cuttings that founded the acclaimed wineries of the [[Barossa Valley]]. After the [[World War II|Second World War]] Italians, Greeks, Dutch, Polish, and possibly every other European nationality came to make a new start. An influx of Asian immigrants following the Vietnam War added to the mix. These new arrivals have blended to form a rich and diverse cuisine and vibrant restaurant culture.

Adelaide's [[The Arts|arts]] scene flourished in the 1970's under the leadership of premier [[Don Dunstan]], removing some of the more [[puritan|puritanical]] restrictions on cultural activities then prevalent around Australia.  Now the city is home to events such as the Barossa Music Festival, the [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]], [[Adelaide Film Festival]], [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas]], [[Come Out]] youth arts festival, the [[Adelaide Fringe Festival|Fringe Festival]], among others. [[WOMADelaide]], Australia's premier [[world music]] event, is now annually held in the scenic surrounds of [[Adelaide Botanic Gardens|Botanic Park]], emphasising Adelaide's dedication to the arts which has prevailed since the days of Don Dunstan.

The annual [[Royal Adelaide Show]], first held in 1840, began as a simple event for the state's farmers to show off their produce. Over time, it grew into a more general commercial [[fair]] held in early September in the inner suburb of [[Wayville, South Australia|Wayville]], with [[amusement ride|carnival ride]]s, food and entertainment surrounding the more traditional agricultural exhibitions and competitions.

The [[music of Adelaide]] has produced various musicians who have achieved both national and worldwide fame. Notably the [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Adelaide Youth Orchestra]], [[The Mark of Cain]], [[The Superjesus]], [[Testeagles]], [[Cold Chisel]] and [[Eric Bogle]]. American artist [[Ben Folds]] considers Adelaide his second home, epitomised in his song &quot;Adelaide&quot; and resides here with his Adelaide-born wife for a number of months each year. The first [[Australian Idol]] winner, [[Guy Sebastian]] hails from the Adelaide suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]] and the popular Australian hip-hop outfit [[Hilltop Hoods]] reside in [[O'Halloran Hill, South Australia|O'Halloran Hill]].

===Media===
Newspapers in Adelaide are dominated by [[News Corp]] tabloid publications. The only South Australian daily newspaper is ''[[The Advertiser (Australia)|The Advertiser]]'', published by News six days per week, while the Sunday paper is the ''[[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|Sunday Mail]]''. There are eleven suburban community newspapers published weekly, known collectively as the ''[[Messenger Newspapers]]'', also published by a subsidiary of News Corp. A recent addition to the print medium in the city is &quot;[[The Independent Weekly]]&quot;, providing one alternative view. Two national daily newspapers are circulated in the city - ''[[The Australian]]'' (Monday&amp;ndash;Friday) and its weekend publication, ''The Weekend Australian'' (Saturday), also published by News Corp., and ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]'' published by [[John Fairfax Holdings|Fairfax]]. ''[[The Adelaide Review]]''  is a free paper published fortnightly and other independent magazine-style papers are published, but are not as widely available.

All of the five Australian national networks broadcast both [[Analog television|analogue]] [[PAL]] and [[widescreen]] [[Digital television|digital]] services in Adelaide. They share three transmission towers on the ridge near the summit of [[Mount Lofty]]. The two government-funded stations are ''[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'' and ''[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]''. The ''[[Seven Network]]'' and ''[[Network Ten]]'' both own their Adelaide stations ([[SAS-7]] and [[ADS-10]] respectively). Adelaide's [[NWS-9]] is affiliated with the ''[[Nine Network]]'' but is actually owned by [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]]. Adelaide also has a [[community television]] station, [[Channel 31]]. The [[Foxtel]] [[pay TV]] service is available as [[cable television]] in a few areas, as is [[satellite television]] to the entire metropolitan area. It is resold by a number of other brands, mostly telephone companies.

===Sport===
[[Image:Clipsal 500.jpg|280px|right|thumb|The annual Adelaide [[Clipsal 500]] race.]]
Adelaide hosted the [[Formula 1]] [[Australian Grand Prix]] from 1985 to 1995 on a [[Adelaide Street Circuit|street circuit]] in the city's eastern parklands. The Grand Prix became a source of pride and losing the Grand Prix to Melbourne in a surprise announcement left a void that has since been filled with the highly successful [[Adelaide 500|Clipsal 500]] [[V8 Supercar]] race event, held on a modified version of the same street circuit. 

Adelaide is the home of two [[Australian Football League]] teams: the [[Adelaide Crows]] and the [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide Football Club]]. A local [[Australian Rules Football]] league, the [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]], is made up of nine teams from around Adelaide. Adelaide's professional [[football (soccer)|soccer]] team [[Adelaide United]] play in the [[A-League]], at [[Hindmarsh Stadium]], one of the few purpose built football stadiums in Australia. The [[Adelaide 36ers]] and the [[Adelaide_Fellas | Adelaide Fellas]] play in national basketball competitions, with home games at the Distinctive Homes Dome and the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]] play in the national netball competition, with home games at [[ETSA Park]]. Most large sporting events take place at either [[AAMI Stadium]] (formerly Football Park) or the historic [[Adelaide Oval]], home of the [[Southern Redbacks]] Cricket Team. Adelaide hosts an international cricket test every summer, along with a number of [[one day international]] cricket matches. 

Adelaide has hosted the annual [[Tour Down Under]] bicycle race since 1999, an event which has gradually built an international reputation with each successive year it has been held. It is also host to the popular [[Bay to Birdwood]] run, featuring vintage and veteran cars from around the world.

==Infrastructure==
===Health===
Adelaide's first hospital was the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] (RAH), founded in [[1840]], it is one of the major hospitals in Adelaide and is a [[teaching hospital]] of the [[University of Adelaide]]. It has a capacity of 500 beds. Two other RAH campuses specialising in specific patient services located in the suburbs of Adelaide - the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre in [[Northfield, South Australia|Northfield]], and the [[Glenside, South Australia|Glenside]] Campus Mental Health Service. The other two largest hospitals in the Adelaide area are the [[Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide|The Women's and Children's Hospital]] (305 beds), which is located on King William Road in [[North Adelaide]] and the Flinders Medical Centre (500 beds), which is located in [[Bedford Park, South Australia|Bedford Park]], [[South Australia]]. These hospitals are also associated with medical schools - the Women and Children's with the [[University of South Australia]]'s Adelaide Campus and the Flinders Medical Centre with [[Flinders University]].

===Transport===
{{Main|Transport in Adelaide}}
[[Image:Mountosmondinterechange_sefreeway.JPG|right|280px|thumb|The [[Mount Osmond, South Australia|Mount Osmond]] Interchange on the [[South Eastern Freeway]].]]
Being centrally located on the Australian mainland, Adelaide forms something of a strategic transport hub for east-west and north-south routes. The city itself has a limited [[public transport]] system, which is managed by and known as the [[Adelaide Metro]]. The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the [[Adelaide O-Bahn]] (a [[guided busway]]), metropolitan railways, and the historic Adelaide-[[Glenelg Tram]]. Road transport in Adelaide has historically been comparatively easier than many of the other Australian cities, with a well-defined city layout and wide multiple-lane roads from the beginning of its development. Historically, Adelaide was known as a &quot;twenty-minute city&quot;, with commuters having being able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in roughly twenty minutes. However, these roads are now inadequate to cope with Adelaide's growing road traffic. {{ref|20mincity}}

The [[Adelaide International Airport]], located at [[West Beach, South Australia|West Beach]], is Australia's newest and most advanced airport terminal and is designed to serve in excess of 5.4 million passengers annually. The new dual international/domestic terminal was to replace the old and ageing terminals known locally as the 'tin sheds', and incorporates new state-of-the-art features, such as glass aerobridges and the ability to cater for the new Airbus A380. The airport is designed to handle 27 aircraft simultaneously and it is capable of processing 3,000 passengers per hour.

===Utilities===
Adelaide has three major energy companies, which provide gas and electricity to the population. ETSA Utilities is the former government-owned company (sold off by the [[John Olsen|Olsen]] Government in the 1990s) and the major player in the Adelaide electicity market. There are other smaller providers, [[AGL]], [[Energy Australia]] and [[Origin Energy]] who provide services in electricity and natural gas. There has been substantial criticism in recent years of the suburban electricity network due to its inability to cope with high-usage periods. Adelaide derives its electricity from a coal-fired plant at [[Torrens Island, South Australia|Torrens Island]] and connections to the national grid. Adelaide's water supply is gained from its reservoirs: [[Mount Bold Reservoir|Mount Bold]], [[Happy Valley Reservoir|Happy Valley]], Myponga, Millbrook, Hope Valley, Little Para and South Para. Further water demands result in the pumping of water from the [[River Murray]]. The provider of water services is by the government-owned [[SA Water]].

===Season/Tournaments===

====Toyota AFL Premiership Season====
The ''Toyota AFL Premiership Season'' lasts for 22 rounds and begins in late March, contested between 16 teams from around Australia. 

At the end of the 22 rounds, the top eight teams compete in the ''[[Toyota AFL Finals Series]]'', in which teams compete in a Qualifying Final or Elimination Final, depending on the teams ladder position. At this stage, only six teams remain, and the bottom four teams play in a Semi Final, in which two teams are eliminated. The remaining four teams play in one of two Preliminary Finals, and the last two teams standing play in the Grand Final. 

The winners of the Grand Final become the premiers of that year. 

The Grand Final is always held at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]],even if two non-[[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] teams are playing.The only recent exception was [[Waverley Park]] in 1991 while the MCG was undergoing redevelopment.

====NAB Cup====
Before the premiership season commences, a knock-out Cup competition is played. It has had several incarnations as the Escort Cup, the Fosters Cup, the [[Ansett Australia]] Cup, the [[Wizard Cup]], and as of the 2006 season it will be known as the [[NAB Cup]].

===AFL Strongholds===
Australian Rules Football is the dominant football code in every state and territory in Australia, except [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]], where [[Rugby League]] dominates, and in [[Australian Capital Territory|A.C.T.]], where [[Rugby Union]] dominates. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]], and [[Tasmania]] massive crowds attend many of the games and AFL is the dominant sport on television, print and radio news.
