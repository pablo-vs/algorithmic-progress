'''Anglesey''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Ynys Môn'', pronounced {{IPA|/ˌ&amp;#592;n&amp;#618;s'mo:n/}} ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]), roughly ''unniss mawn''), is an island and county at the northwestern extremity of [[north Wales]]. It is separated from the mainland by a narrow stretch of water known as the [[Menai Strait]]. It is connected to the mainland by two bridges, the original [[Menai Suspension Bridge]] (carrying the [[A5 road|A5]]), built by [[Thomas Telford]] in 1826 as a road link, and the newer, twice reconstructed [[Britannia Bridge]], carrying the [[A55 road|A55]] and the [[North Wales Coast Line|North Wales Coast Railway line]].  The county of Anglesey covers a number of islands apart from Anglesey itself, in particular [[Holy Island, Anglesey|Holy Island]].

==History==
Historically, Anglesey has long been associated with the [[Druidry|Druid]]s. In c. AD 60 the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] general [[Suetonius Paullinus]], determined to break the power of the druids, attacked the island, destroying the shrine and the sacred groves. The Romans called the island ''Mona''. After the Romans, the island was invaded by [[Vikings]], [[Saxons]], and [[Normans]] before falling to [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] of England, in the [[13th century]].

''Môn'' is the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name of Anglesey. The English name is a corrupted form of [[Old Norse]], meaning the 'Isle of Ongull'. [[Old Welsh]] names are ''Ynys Dywyll'' (&quot;Dark Isle&quot;) and ''Ynys y Cedairn'' (''cedyrn'' or ''kedyrn''; &quot;Isle of brave folk&quot;). It is the ''Mona'' of [[Tacitus]] (Ann. xiv. 29, Agr. xiv. 18), [[Pliny the Elder]] (iv. 16) and [[Dio Cassius]] (62). It is called ''Mam Cymru'' (&quot;Mother of Wales&quot;) by [[Giraldus Cambrensis]]. ''Clas Merddin'', and ''Y fêl Ynys'' (honey isle) are other names. According to the Triads (67), Anglesey was once part of the mainland, as geology proves. The island was the seat of the [[Druid]]s, of whom 28 [[cromlech]]s remain on uplands overlooking the sea; e.g. at [[Plâs Newydd]]. The Druids were attacked in [[61]] by [[Suetonius Paulinus]], and again in [[78]] by [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]]. The present road from [[Holyhead]] to [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]] was originally a Roman road. British and Roman camps, coins and ornaments have been dug up and discussed, especially by the Hon. Mr. Stanley of Penrhos. The foundations of [[Holyhead]] are [[Caer Gybi]] Roman. 

As an island ''Môn'' would usually be a good defensive position and because of this it was the site of the court or ''Llys'' of the kings and princes of Gwynedd at [[Aberffraw]]. Apart from a devastating [[Denmark|Danish]] raid in [[853]] this was to remain the case until the thirteenth century when improvements to the English navy made it indefensible.

==Geography==
Anglesey is a relatively low-lying island with slight risings such as [[Parys Mountain]],  Cadair Mynachdy (or Monachdy, i.e., &quot;chair of the monastery&quot;; there is a Nanner, &quot;convent&quot;, not far away), [[Mynydd Bodafon]] and [[Holyhead Mountain]]. It was known as the breadbasket of Wales, referred to during the Middle Ages as ''Anglesey, Mother of Wales'' (Welsh: ''Môn, Mam Cymru''). This gave it substantial strategic importance during the struggles between the English kings and the Welsh princes.

Anglesey has many small towns scattered all around the island, making it quite evenly populated. [[Beaumaris, Wales|Beaumaris]] (Welsh: ''Biwmares''), to the south of the island, features [[Beaumaris Castle]], built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] as part of his campaign in North Wales. The town of [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]] (Welsh: ''Niwbwrch''), created when the townfolk of Llanfaes were relocated to make way for the building of Beaumaris Castle, includes the site of [[Llys Rhosyr]], another of the courts of the mediaeval Welsh princes and which features one of the oldest courtrooms in the United Kingdom. Beaumaris acts as a [[yachting]] centre for the region with many boats mored in the bay or off Gallows point.  [[Llangefni]] is located in the centre of the island and is also the island's administrative centre. The town of [[Menai Bridge]] (Welsh: ''Porthaethwy'') expanded when the first bridge to the mainland was being built, in order to accommodate workers and construction. Up until that time Porthaethwy had been one of the principal ferry crossing points from the mainland. A short distance from this town lies [[Bryn Celli Ddu]], a [[Stone Age]] burial mound. The town of [[Amlwch]] is situated in the northeast of the island and was once largely industrialised, having grown during the 18th century supporting the [[copper]] mining industry at Parys Mountain.

The island also has the village with the longest official place name in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch]]. Other towns and settlements include [[Cemaes]], [[Benllech]], [[Pentraeth]], [[Gaerwen]], [[Dwyran]], [[Bodedern]] and [[Rhosneigr]]. The [[Anglesey Sea Zoo]] is a local tourist attraction, providing a look at and descriptions of local marine [[wildlife]] from [[European lobster|lobsters]] to [[conger eel]]s. All the [[fish]] and [[crustacean]]s on display are caught around the island and are placed in reconstructions of their natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. They also make [[salt]] (evaporated from the local sea water) and commercially breed lobsters, for food, and [[oyster]]s, for pearls, both from local stocks.

The island's entire rural coastline had been designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] and features many sandy beaches, especially along its eastern coast between the towns of Beaumaris and Amlwch and along the western coast from [[Ynys Llanddwyn]] through [[Rhosneiger]] to the little bays around Carmel Head. Tourism is now the most significant economic activity on the island.  Agriculture provides the secondary source of income for the island's economy, with the local dairies being amongst the most productive in the region. There is also a nuclear power station, at [[Wylfa]] Head on the north coast.

Major industries are restricted to Holyhead which supports an [[aluminium]] smelter and the [[Amlwch]] area where the [[Wylfa]] nuclear power station is located close to  a [[bromine]] extraction plant. There are a wide range of smaller industries, mostly located in industrial and business parks especially at [[Llangefni]] and [[Gaerwen]]. These industries include an [[Slaughterhouse|abbatoir]] and fine chemicals manufacture as well as factories for timber production, aluminium smelting, fish farming , and food processing.

The island is also on one of the major routes from the mainland of Great Britain to [[Ireland]], via [[ferry|ferries]] from [[Holyhead]], off the west of Anglesey on [[Holy Island, Anglesey|Holy Island]], to [[Dún Laoghaire]] and [[Dublin]] Port.

There are a few lakes mostly in the west, such as Cors cerrig y daran, but rivers are few and small. There are two large water supply reservoirs operated by Dwr Cymru . These are [[Llyn Cefni]] in the centre of the island, which is fed by the headwaters of the [[River Cefni|Afon Cefni]], and [[Llyn Alaw]] to the north of the island. [[Llyn Llywenan]] is  the largest natural lake on the island.

The climate is humid but generally equable due the effects of the [[gulf stream]] bathing the island. The land is of variable quality and it may have been more fertile in the past.

==Ecology and Conservation==
Much of Anglesey is covered with relatively intensive cattle and sheep farming aided by modern agro-chemicals. In these areas there is little of ecological conservation worth. However there are a number of important wet-land sites which have protected status. In addition the several lakes  all have significant ecological interest including their support for a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic bird species. In the west, the [[Malltraeth]] marshes are believed to be supporting an occasional visiting [[Bittern]] and the nearby estuary of the [[River Cefni|Afon Cefni]] supports a bird population made internationally famous by the paintings of [[Charles Tunnicliffe]].

The  sheer cliff faces at South Stack near Holyhead provide nesting sites for huge numbers of [[Auk|auks]] including [[Puffin]]s, [[Razorbill]]s and [[Guillemot]]s together with [[Chough]]s and [[peregrine_falcon|Peregrine falcons]].

Three sites on Anglesey are important for breeding terns - see [[Anglesey tern colonies]].

Almost the entire coastline of Anglesey is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty [http://www.sos.bangor.ac.uk/aerial/index.htm]

==Culture==
Anglesey hosted the [[National Eisteddfod]] in [[1999]].

==Geology==
The geology of Anglesey is notably complex and is frequently used for geology [[field trip]]s by schools and colleges. Younger strata in Anglesey rest upon a foundation of very old [[pre-Cambrian]] rocks that appear at the surface in four areas:
#a western region including Holyhead and [[Llanfaethlu]],
#a central area about [[Aberffraw]] and [[Trefdraeth]], 
#an eastern region which includes [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]], [[Caerwen]] and [[Pentraeth]] and
#a coastal region at [[Glyn Garth]] between [[Menai Bridge]] and [[Beaumaris]].
These [[pre-Cambrian]] rocks are [[schist|schists]] and [[slate|slates]], often much contorted and disturbed.  The general line of strike of the formations in the island is from north-east to south-west.  A belt of [[granitic|granitic rocks]] lies immediately north-west of the central pre-Cambrian mass, reaching from [[Llanfaelog]] near the coast to the vicinity of [[Llanerchymedd]].  Between this granite and the pre-Cambrian of Holyhead is a narrow tract of [[Ordovician]] slates and grits with Llandovery beds in places; this tract spreads out in the north of the island between [[Dulas Bay]] and Carmel Point.  A small patch of Ordovician strata lies on the northern side of Beaumaris.  In parts, these Ordovician rocks are much folded, crushed and metamorphosed, and they are associated with schists and altered volcanic rocks which are probably pre-Cambrian.  Between the eastern and central pre-Cambrian masses [[carboniferous]] rocks are found.  The carboniferous [[limestone]] occupies a broad area south of [[Lligwy Bay]] and [[Pentraeth]], and sends a narrow spur in a south-westerly direction by [[Llangefni]] to [[Malltraeth|Malltraeth sands]].  The limestone is underlain on the north-west by a red basement conglomerate and yellow [[sandstone]] (sometimes considered to be of Old Red Sandstone age).  Limestone occurs again on the north coast about [[Llanfihangel]] and [[Llangoed]]; and in the south-west round Llanidan on the border of the [[Menai Strait]]. [[Puffin Island]] is made of carboniferous limestone.  [[Malltraeth|Malltraeth marsh]] is occupied by coal measures, and a small patch of the same formation appears near [[Tall-y-foel]] Ferry on the [[Menai Strait]].  A patch of [[granite|granitic]] and [[felsite|felsitic]] rocks form [[Parys Mountain]], where copper and iron ochre have been worked.  [[Serpentine]] (Mona Marble) is found near [[Llanfairynneubwll]] and upon the opposite shore in [[Holyhead]]. There are abundant evidences of glaciation, and much boulder clay and drift sand covers the older rocks.  Patches of brown sand occur on the south-west coast.

==Politics==
Anglesey (together with Holy Island) is one of the thirteen [[traditional counties of Wales]]. In medieval times, before the conquest of Wales in [[1283]], ''Môn'' often had periods of temporary independence as it was frequently bequeathed to the heirs of kings as a [[sub kingdom]] of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]. The last times this occurred were for a few years after 1171 following the death of [[Owain Gwynedd]] when the island was inherited by [[Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd]] and again between 1246 - c.1255 when it was given to [[Owain Goch]] as his share of the kingdom. Following the conquest of Wales by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] it was created a county under the terms of the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] of 1284. Prior to this it had been divided into the ''[[cantref|cantrefi]]'' of:

* [[Cantref Aberffraw|Aberffraw]]
* [[Cantref Rhosyr|Rhosyr]]
* [[Cantref Cemais|Cemais]]

In 1974 it formed a district of the new large [[Administrative counties of Wales|administrative county]] of [[Gwynedd]], until in the 1996 reform of local government it was restored as an administrative county.  The county council is a [[unitary authority]] and is named &quot;Isle of Anglesey County Council / Cyngor Sir Ynys Môn&quot;.  While there is currently a majority of independent councillors, the council is under no overall control, as the members do not generally divide along party lines.  The only party group on the council is that of [[Plaid Cymru]].  There are five non-partisan groups on the council, containing a mix of party and independent candidates.  The largest of these groups is ''Môn Ymlaen''/''Anglesey Forward'', with 15 members out of the 40 in total.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aromatherapy''', commonly associated with [[complementary and alternative medicine]] (CAM), is the use of volatile liquid plant materials, known as [[essential oils]] (EOs), and other aromatic compounds from plants to affect someone's mood or health. The word was coined in the [[1920s]] by French chemist René Maurice Gattefossé. 

The main branches of aromatherapy include:
* Home aromatherapy (self treatment, perfume &amp; cosmetic use)
* Clinical aromatherapy (as part of [[pharmacology]] and [[pharmacotherapy]])
* [[Aromachology]] (the psychology of odors and their effects on the mind)


== Materials ==
Some of the materials employed include:
* [[Essential oil]]s from [[distillation]] (e.g. [[eucalyptus]] oil) or expression ([[grapefruit]] oil)
* [[Absolutes]], oils extracted by [[solvent]] or [[supercritical fluid]] extraction (e.g. [[rose]] absolute)
* [[Hydrosol]]s, aqueous [[by-product]]s of the distillation process (e.g. [[rosewater]])
* [[Infusion]]s, aqueous solutions of plant material (e.g. infusion of [[chamomile]])
* [[Phytoncide]]s, natural [[volatile organic compound]]s from plants
* [[Carrier oil]]s used to dilute essential oils for use on the skin (e.g. [[almond|sweet almond]] oil)

== Theory ==
When aromatherapy is used for the treatment or prevention of disease, a precise knowledge of the bioactivity and [[synergy]] of the essential oils used, knowledge of the dosage and duration of application, as well as, naturally, a medical diagnosis, are required.  In the Anglo-Saxon world, even among &quot;natural&quot; practitioners like herbalists or naturopaths, aromatherapy is regarded more as an art form than a valid healing science.  At best, it is viewed as a complementary and seldom the only treatment prescribed.   On the continent, especially in France, where it originated, aromatherapy is incorporated into mainstream medicine. There, the use of the anti-septic properties of oils in the control of infections is emphasized over the more &quot;touchy feely&quot; approaches familiar to English speakers. In France some essential oils are regulated as [[prescription drug]]s, and thus administered by a [[physician]]. In many countries they are included in the national [[pharmacopeia]], but up to the present moment aromatherapy as science has never been recognized as a valid branch of medicine in the United States, Russia or Germany.

Essential oils, phytoncides and other natural [[volatile organic compound|VOC]]s work in different ways. At the scent level they activate the limbic system and emotional centers of the brain. When applied to the skin (commonly in form of &quot;massage oils&quot; i.e. 1-10% solutions of EO in carrier oil) they activate thermal receptors, and kill microbes and fungi. Internal application of essential oil preparations (mainly in pharmacological drugs; generally not recommended for home use apart from dilution - 1-5% in fats or mineral oils, or hydrosoles) may stimulate the immune system, urine secretion, may have antiseptic activity etc. 
Different essential oils have very different activity; they are studied in [[pharmacology]] and [[aromachology]].   
 
It is significant to note the concept of [[chemotype]] in essential oil chemistry. Eucalyptus, for example, has many species, such as ''Eucalyptus globulus'' (main component is 1,8 cineole), ''Eucalyptus citriodora'' (citral), ''Eucalyptus menthol'', and others.  Properties of the essential oils of the same generic (common) name are not all the same; they can differ widely in their chemical components and in their therapeutic actions. Likewise, their chemical makeup depends on the method of extraction (e.g. pressed and distilled bergamot oil have different uses). The practitioner must be aware of these factors. 

For medicinal aromatherapy the essential oil specification must meet the following criteria:
* Full botanical name of the plant (e.g. ''[[Wild mint]] oil from Mentha arvensis'')
* Type of extraction method: ''essential oil'', ''absolute'', ''СО2-extract'', ''cold pressing'' (e.g. ''Rose oil—absolute'', or ''Rose—essential oil'')
* Chemotype of the plant—noting the species or cultivar of the raw material (e.g. ''[[Rosemary]] essential oil—[[camphor]] type'')
* Part of the plant used (e.g. ''[[Cinnamon]] essential oil—[[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] type from leaves'')
* Grade, if manufacturers traditionally use such gradation (e.g. ''[[Ylang-ylang]] essential oil, the premium grade''). Reputable aromatherapists insist on pharmaceutical grade that is a higher grade than oils suitable for perfumery or flavoring or other non-therapeutic use.
* Indication of any additional processing of the oil (e.g. ''[[Lemon]] essential oil, deterpenized'')
* Main chemical component, when standardized (e.g. ''[[Peppermint]] oil, rectific. 30/35''—meaning the menthol content is between 30-35%)
* Country of manufacture—frequently it is possible to deduce from this the composition of the oil  (e.g. a batch of ''[[sweet flag|Calamus]] essential oil, [[India]]'' tends to have high [[azaron]] content, while [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] samples of Calamus tend to be lower in azaron content)

== Application ==
While the practice of aromatherapy is sometimes thought to be confined to [[inhalation]], it may include various methods, including:
* Inhalation (directly or diffused into the air)
* Absorption through the skin (baths, massages, compresses)
* Absorption through the mucous membranes (oral rinses and gargles)
* Ingestion (occasionally prescribed, with caveats)

== Therapeutic effects ==
Aromatherapy is based mainly on the following therapeutic effects:
* [[Antiseptic]] effects: [[viricide|viricidial]], [[bactericide|bactericidal]], [[fungicide|fungicidal]]
* [[Anesthetic]] action (menthol, camphor)
* [[Central nervous system]] effects
* [[Metabolism|Metabolic ]] / [[Endocrine]] effects
* [[Psychology|Psychological]] effects
* [[Immunostimulator]]

Fragrances can have a relaxing effect measured as an increase in alpha [[brain wave]]s. 

One of the best known essential oils for aromatherapy is [[lavender]], which is recommended by practitioners for treating wounds, to enhance memory, and to aid sleep by combating [[anxiety]] and [[insomnia]].  Other popular scents include [[eucalyptus]], [[rose]], [[jasmine]] and [[bergamot]].

Aromatherapy is among the fastest growing fields in alternative and holistic medicine. Aromatherapy is sometimes used in clinics and hospitals for treatment of pain relief, for labor pain, for relieving pain caused by the side effects of the chemotherapy, and for the rehabilitation of cardiac patients.

== Criticism ==
Skeptics argue that while pleasant scents can be relaxing, lowering stress and related effects, there is currently insufficient scientific proof of the effectiveness of aromatherapy. Like many [[alternative medicine|alternative therapies]], few controlled, [[double-blind]] studies have been carried out&amp;mdash;a common explanation is that there is little incentive to do so if the results of the studies are not [[Patentability|patentable]].  There are some treatments generally accepted in [[Western medicine]] to give a form of relief for the airways in case of cold or flu, such as [[mint]] and [[eucalyptus]] essential oils. Skeptical literature often depicts aromatherapy as based on [[anecdotal evidence]] of its benefits rather than proof that aromatherapy can cure diseases. Some skeptics acknowledge that aromatherapy has limited scientific support but argue that its claims go beyond the data or that the studies are not adequately controlled and peer reviewed. If there can be positive effects, there can also be negative ones if used incorrectly or in bad combinations especially with traditional pharmacology.

The term &quot;aromatherapy&quot; has been applied to such a wide range of products that almost anything which contains essential oils is likely to be called an &quot;aromatherapy product&quot;, rendering the term somewhat meaningless in that context.

Some proponents of aromatherapy believe that the claimed effect of each type of oil is not caused by the chemicals in the oil interacting with the senses, but that the oil contains a distillation of the &quot;life force&quot; of the plant from which it is derived that will &quot;balance the energies&quot; of the body and promote healing or well-being by purging negative vibrations from the body's energy field. Arguing that there is little [[scientific method|scientific evidence]] that healing can be achieved, or that the claimed &quot;energies&quot; even exist, many [[scientific skepticism|skeptics]] reject this form of aromatherapy as [[pseudoscience]] or even [[quackery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:Aleksandr Fedorovich Kerensky.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Alexander Kerensky]]

'''Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Алекса́ндр Фёдорович Ке́ренский) ([[April 22]], [[1881]] ([[May 2]], [[New Style]]) - [[June 11]], [[1970]]) was a Russian revolutionary leader, who was instrumental in toppling the Russian [[Monarchy]].  He served as the second [[Prime Minister]] of the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Russian Provisional Government]], immediately before [[Lenin]] seized power in the [[October Revolution|October Revolution]].

==Early life and activism==
Kerensky was born in [[Simbirsk]] (now [[Ulyanovsk]]) the son of a headmaster. This was also Lenin's birthplace, and at one point Kerensky's father Fyodor taught the young [[Vladimir Ulyanov]] at [[Kazan State University|Kazan University]]. Kerensky graduated in law from [[Saint Petersburg University]] in 1904. He showed his political sympathies early on with his frequent defence of anti-Tsarist revolutionaries. He was elected to the Fourth [[Duma]] in 1912 as a member of the [[Trudoviks]] (a moderate [[Labour movement|labour party]]). A brilliant orator and skilled parliamentary leader, he became a member of the [[Provisional Committee of the Duma]] as a [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionary]] and a leader of the [[socialism|socialist]] opposition to the regime of the ruling [[tsar]], [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. 

==February Revolution of 1917==
When the [[February Revolution]] broke out in 1917 Kerensky was one of the revolution's most prominent leaders, and was elected vice-chairman of the [[Petrograd Soviet]] ([[soviet|workers' council]]). When the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]] was formed he was initially Minister of Justice, but he became Minister of War in May and Prime Minister in July 1917. Following the failed [[coup]] of General [[Lavr Kornilov]] in August and the resignation of the ministers, he appointed himself Supreme Commander-in-Chief as well. 

Kerensky's essential problem in office was that Russia was exhausted after three years of [[warfare]] and the Russian people wanted nothing but peace. Lenin and his [[Bolshevik]] party were promising &quot;peace, land, and bread&quot; under a [[communist]] system, and the army was disintegrating as the peasant and worker soldiers deserted. But Kerensky and the other political leaders felt obliged by their commitments to Russia's allies to continue the war, and also correctly feared that [[Germany]] would demand enormous territorial concessions as the price for peace. Kerensky's refusal to withdraw Russia from the war proved his undoing.

==October Revolution of 1917==
During the [[Kornilov Coup]] Kerensky had distributed arms to the [[Petrograd]] workers, and by October most of these armed workers had gone over to the Bolsheviks. Lenin was determined to overthrow Kerensky's [[government]] before it could be legitimised by the planned [[election]]s for a [[Russian Constituent Assembly]], and on [[October 25]] ([[November 7]] New Style), the Bolsheviks took power in what became known as the [[October Revolution]]. 

Kerensky escaped the Bolsheviks and went to [[Pskov]], where he rallied loyal troops for an attempt to retake the [[capital city|capital]]. His troops captured [[Tsarskoe Selo]] but were defeated the next day at [[Pulkovo]]. Kerensky narrowly escaped this defeat, and for the next few weeks he lived in hiding until he could leave the country, eventually arriving in [[France]]. During the [[Russian Civil War]] he supported neither side - he opposed both the Bolshevik regime and the reactionary [[White Movement]] generals trying to restore the monarchy.

==Life in exile==
Kerensky lived in [[Paris]] until 1940, engaged in the endless splits and quarrels of the exiled Russian democratic leaders. When the Germans overran France, he escaped to the [[United States]] in 1940.

In 1939 he had married former [[Australian]] [[journalism|journalist]] Lydia ‘Nell' Tritton.  In 1945 his wife became terminally ill.  He travelled with her to [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] and lived there with her family until her death in February 1946.  Thereafter he returned to the United States where he lived until his death. 

When [[Adolf Hitler]]'s forces invaded the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941, Kerensky offered his support to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], but received no reply. Instead he made broadcasts in [[Russian language|Russian]] in support of the war effort. After the war he organised a group called the [[Union for the Liberation of Russia]], but this achieved little.

[[Image:Kerenskygrave.jpg|thumb|left|Grave of Kerensky in London]]

Kerensky eventually settled in [[New York City]], but he spent much of his time at the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]] in [[California]], where he both used and contributed to the Institution's huge archive on [[Russian history]], and where he taught graduate courses.  He wrote and broadcast extensively on Russian [[politics]] and [[history]].

Kerensky's major works of writing include ''The Prelude to Bolshevism'' (1919), ''The Catastrophe'' (1927), ''The Crucifixion of Liberty'' (1934) and ''Russia and History's Turning Point'' (1966).

Kerensky died at his home in New York in 1970, one of the last surviving major participants in the turbulent events of 1917.  The local [[Russian Orthodox Church]]es in New York refused to grant Kerensky burial, seeing him as being largely responsible for Russia falling to the Bolsheviks. A [[Serbian Orthodox church]] also refused. Kerensky's body was then flown to [[London]] where he was buried at a non-denominational [[cemetery]].

Saint '''Ansgar''', '''Anskar''' or '''Oscar''', ([[September 8]]?, [[801]]&amp;ndash;[[February 3]], [[865]]) was an [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]]. The see of Hamburg was designated a &quot;Mission to bring Christianity to the [[Northern Europe|North]]&quot;, and Ansgar became known as the &quot;Apostle of the North&quot;.

Ansgar was born in [[Amiens]]. He had for a period resided with the baptized [[Denmark|Danish]] king [[Harald Klak]] and when [[Louis the Pious]] at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in [[829]] was requested by two representatives from [[Sweden]] and the Swedish king [[Björn at Hauge]], he appointed Ansgar missionary. The representatives had claimed that the several [[Swedes]] were willing to convert to Christendom. Ansgar arrived at [[Birka]] in 829, with his aide friar Witmar, and a small congregation was formed in [[831]], which included the king's own steward Hergeir, as the most prominent member.

He died 865 in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]. His life story was written by his successor as archbishop, [[Rimbert]], in [[Vita Ansgari]].

Statues dedicated to him stand in Hamburg and Copenhagen as well as a stone cross at Birka. A [[Impact crater|crater]] on the [[Moon]], [[Ansgarius (crater)|Ansgarius]], has been named for him. Ansgar is the patron saint of Denmark. His [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] is [[3 february]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Automated theorem proving''' (currently the most important subfield of  ''[[automated reasoning]]'') is the [[mathematical proof|proving]] of mathematical [[theorem]]s by a computer program. Depending on the underlying logic, the problem of deciding the validity of a theorem varies from trivial to impossible. For the frequent case of [[propositional logic]], the problem is decidable but [[NP-complete]], and hence only exponential-time algorithms are believed to exist for general proving tasks. For [[first-order logic]] it is [[recursively enumerable]], i.e., given unbounded resources, any valid theorem can eventually be proven. Invalid statements, i.e. formulas that are ''not'' entailed by a given theory, cannot always be recognized.  In these cases, a first-order theorem prover may fail to terminate while searching for a proof. Despite these theoretical limits, practical theorem provers can solve many hard problems in these logics.

A simpler, but related problem is [[proof verification]], where an existing proof for a theorem is certified valid. For this, it is generally required that each individual proof step can be verified by a [[primitive recursive function]] or program, and hence the problem is always decidable. 

''Interactive theorem provers'' require a human user to give hints to the system. Depending on the degree of automation, the prover can essentially be reduced to a proof checker, with the user providing the proof in a formal way, or significant proof tasks can be performed automatically. Interactive provers are used for a variety of tasks, but even fully automatic systems have by now proven a number of interesting and hard theorems, including some that have eluded human mathematicians for a long time. However, these successes are sporadic, and work on hard problems usually requires a proficient user.

Another distinction is sometimes drawn between theorem proving and other techniques, where a process is considered to be theorem proving if it consists of a traditional proof, starting with axioms and producing new inference steps using rules of inference.  
Other techniques would include [[model checking]], which is equivalent to brute-force enumeration of many possible states (although the actual implementation of model checkers requires much cleverness, and does not simply reduce to brute force).  
There are hybrid theorem proving systems which use model checking as an inference rule.
There are also programs which were written to prove a particular theorem, with a (usually informal) proof that if the program finishes with a certain result, then the theorem is true.
A good example of this was the machine-aided proof of the [[four color theorem]], which was very controversial as the first claimed mathematical proof which was essentially impossible to verify by humans due to the enormous size of the program's calculation (such proofs are called non-surveyable proofs). 
Another example would be the proof that the game [[Connect Four]] is a win for the first player.

Commercial use of automated theorem proving is mostly concentrated in integrated circuit design and verification.  Since the [[Pentium FDIV bug]], the complicated [[floating point unit]]s of modern microprocessors have been designed with extra scrutiny.  In the latest processors from [[AMD]], [[Intel]], and others, automated theorem proving has been used to verify that the divide and other operations are correct.

==First-order theorem proving==

[[First-order logic|First-order]] theorem proving is one of the most mature subfields of automated theorem proving. The logic is expressive enough to allow the specification of arbitrary problems, often in a reasonably natural and intuitive way. On the other hand, it is still semi-decidable, and a number of sound and complete calculi have been developed, enabling ''fully'' automated systems. The quality of implemented system  has benefited by the existence of a large library of standard benchmark examples (the [[TPTP]]), as well as by the [[Conference on Automated Deduction|CADE]] ATP System Competition (CASC), a yearly competition of first-order systems for many important classes of first-order problems.

[[Image:Agent Orange Cropdusting.jpg|thumb|right|250px|U.S. Military planes cropdusting in Vietnam during [[Operation Ranch Hand]]]]'''Agent Orange''' is the code name for a powerful [[herbicide]] and [[defoliant]] used by the [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] in its [[Herbicidal Warfare]] program during the [[Vietnam War]]. Agent Orange was used from 1961 to 1971, and was by far the most used of the so-called &quot;rainbow herbicides&quot; used during the program. Agent Orange (as well as [[Agent Purple|Agents Purple]], [[Agent Pink|Pink]], [[Agent Blue|Blue]] and [[Agent Green|Green]]) contained [[dioxin]]s which caused serious harm to the health of exposed Vietnamese, South Koreans, Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians and Americans, as well as their children and grandchildren. Dioxins are recognized as strong [[carcinogen]]s and [[Teratogenesis|teratogen]]s (literally, ''monster-making'') - which are persistent in the environment and in the human body. Since the [[1980s]], several lawsuits have been filed against the companies who produced Agent Orange, among them being [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemical]] and [[Monsanto]]. U.S. veterans obtained $180 million in compensation in 1984, while Australian, Canadian and New Zealand veterans also obtained compensation in an out-of-court settlement the same year. In 1999, 20,000 South Koreans filed a lawsuit in Korea; in January 2006, the Korean Appeal Court ordered Monsanto and Dow to pay $62 million in compensation to about 6,800 people. However, the Vietnamese victims, by far the most affected, haven't yet obtained compensation, and a U.S. Appeal Court is due to examine their appeal in March 2006.

== Description ==

Agent Orange is a roughly 1:1 mixture of two [[phenoxy herbicide]]s in [[ester]] form, [[2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D) and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T). These herbicides were developed during the 1940s by independent teams in [[England]] and the [[United States]] for use in controlling broad-leaf plants. Phenoxy agents work by mimicking a plant [[growth hormone]], [[indoleacetic acid]] (IAA). When sprayed on broad-leaf plants they induce rapid, uncontrolled growth, eventually killing them. When sprayed on crops such as [[wheat]] or [[maize|corn]], it selectively kills just the broad-leaf plants in the field - the weeds - leaving the crop relatively unaffected. First introduced in 1946, these herbicides were in widespread use in [[agriculture]] by the middle of the 1950s.

It was later learned that a dioxin, [[tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin]] (TCDD), is produced as a side effect of the manufacture of 2,4,5-T, and was thus present in any of the herbicides that used it. The '''National Toxicology Program''' has classified TCDD to be a known human carcinogen, frequently associated with soft-tissue sarcoma, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). 2,4,5-T has since been banned for use in the US and many other countries.

The herbicide 2,4-D does not contain dioxin, and remains one of the most used herbicides in the world today.

Diseases associated with dioxin exposure are [[chloracne]], [[Soft tissue sarcoma|soft tissue sarcomas]], [[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin's disease]], and [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma|non-Hodgkin's disease]]. Diseases with limited evidence of an association with Agent Orange are respiratory cancers, [[prostate cancer]], [[multiple myeloma]], [[Porphyria cutanea tarda]] (a type of skin disease), acute and subacute transient [[Peripheral neuropathy|peripheral neuropathy]], [[spina bifida]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes]], and [[Acute myelogenous leukemia|acute myelogenous leukemia]] found only in the second or third generation. Diseases with inadequate or insufficent evidence of an association are hepatobiliary cancers, nasal or [[nasophargyngeal cancer]]s, bone cancer, female reproductive cancers, [[renal cancer]], [[testicular cancer]], [[leukemia]], spontaneous abortion, [[birth defect]]s, neonatal or infant death and [[stillbirth]]s, low birth weight, childhood cancers, abnormal sperm parameters, cognitive neuropsychiatric disorders, [[ataxia]], peripheral nervous system disorders, circulatory disorders, respiratory disorders, skin cancers, urinary and bladder cancer. Diseases with limited or suggestive evidence of no association are gastrointestinal tumors such as stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, [[colon cancer]], and rectal cancer, and [[brain tumor]]s.

== Use in Vietnam (1961-1971) ==

:''This section covers the use of all of the &quot;rainbow&quot; herbicides.''

During the [[Vietnam War]], the US instituted a massive herbicidal program that ran from 1961 through 1971. The aim of the program was two-fold, one to destroy the &quot;cover&quot; provided by the jungle-like forest, and another to deny food to the enemy. First named [[Operation Trail Dust]], then [[Operation Hades]], it was finally renamed [[Operation Ranch Hand]].

A variety of chemicals, fifteen in total, were tested or used operationally during this program. The primary broad-leaf herbicides sprayed during the &quot;testing&quot; phase of the program between 1962 and 1964 were Agent Orange, [[Agent Purple]] and [[Agent White]]. The chemicals themselves had no color, the names refer to colored stripes painted on the 55 gallon barrels to identify their contents. Much smaller amounts of other herbicides were also tested, including [[Agent Pink]], [[Agent Green]], Dinoxol, Trinoxol, Bromacil, Diquat, Tandex, Monuron, Diuron and Dalapon. [[Agent Blue]] was an unrelated herbicide based primarily on [[arsenic]] used to kill [[rice]] plants which were not susceptible to the phenoxy-based agents. A variety of [[Paraquat]]-related chemicals were apparently also tested in this role. For spraying, the various agents were mixed with [[kerosene]] or [[diesel]] fuel.

By 1964 the testing phase had ended, and Agent Orange was selected as the most effective agent for &quot;territory denial&quot;. Operational use started in January 1965, increasing in breadth as [[logistics|logistical]] problems were solved. Most of Agent Orange sprayed during the program was delivered from modified [[US Air Force]] [[C-123 Provider|C-123K ''Provider'']] aircraft under a program known as [[Operation Ranch Hand]]. Other delivery methods included helicopters, truck and hand spraying, notably for the areas directly around US bases. From 1968 on, an improved version known as &quot;Orange II&quot; or &quot;Super Orange&quot; was used as well.

Spraying reached its maximum during the most intense period of the war, between 1967 and 1968. After that the program &quot;drew down&quot;, and ended in 1971. By this point an estimated '''19 million gallons''' of herbicide had been sprayed on [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Thailand]], somewhat more than half (55%) of that Agent Orange, between 1962 and 1971. Early estimates from 1974 had placed the amounts lower, between 12 and 14 million gallons. In total about six million acres were sprayed in Vietnam alone.

The military effectiveness of the program appears debatable. Many of the areas sprayed were not directly involved in later military actions. Of course, this could be considered as evidence ''for'' the effectiveness of the program. Nor does it appear there is any measurable effect on the warfighting abilities of the groups involved, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] were able to mount full scale assaults in 1972 with little US intervention prior, which suggests that the program was, militarily, a failure.

== Effects of the program ==

=== The New Jersey Agent Orange Commission ===

In 1980, [[New Jersey]] created the New Jersey Agent Orange Commission, the first state commission created to study its effects. The Commission's research project in association with Rutgers University was called &quot;The Pointman Project&quot;. It was disbanded by governor [[Christine Todd Whitman]] in 1996.

=== The National Academy of Science 2003 report ===

An April 2003 report paid for by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] concluded that during the [[Vietnam War]], '''3,181 villages''' were sprayed directly with herbicides. Between '''2.1 and 4.8 million people''' &quot;would have been present during the spraying.&quot; Furthermore, many US military personnel were also sprayed or came in contact with herbicides in recently sprayed areas. The study was originally undertaken for the US military to get a better count of how many veterans served in sprayed areas and researchers were given access to military records and Air Force operational folders previously not studied. The re-estimate made by the report places the volume of herbicides sprayed between 1962 and 1971 to a level 7,131,907 liters more than an uncorrected estimate published in 1974 and 9.4 million more liters than a 1974 corrected inventory. It was produced under contract for the Army by [[Diamond Shamrock]], [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow]], Hercules, [[Monsanto]], [[T-H Agricultural &amp; Nutrition]], [[Thompson Chemicals]], and [[United States Rubber Company|Uniroyal]].  

The National Academy of Sciences has also noted the harmful effects of the herbicides on US soldiers.

== Lawsuits ==

In 1984, Agent Orange manufacturers paid Australian, Canadian and New Zealand veterans in an out-of-court settlement {{ref|MercuryNews}}.

=== US Vietnamese victims class action lawsuit ===

On January 31, 2004, a [[victim's rights group]], the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/Dioxin (VAVA), filed a [[class action]] lawsuit in a US Federal [[District Court]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]], against several US companies, for liability in causing personal injury, by developing and producing the chemical. [[Dow Chemical]] and [[Monsanto]] were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the [[US military]], and were named in the suit along with eight other companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.). A number of lawsuits by American [[G.I.| GIs]] have been won in the years since the Vietnam War. 

On March 10, 2005, the District Court [[judge]] Jack Weinstein - who had defended the US veterans victims of Agent Orange - dismissed the suit, ruling that there was no legal basis for the [[plaintiff | plaintiffs']] claims. The judge concluded that Agent Orange was not considered a poison under [[international law]] at the time of its use by the US; that the US was not prohibited from using it as an herbicide; and that the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government. The US [[government]], which has [[sovereign immunity]], had not been a target of the lawsuit. However, in 1984, chemical companies that manufactured Agent Orange paid $180 million into a fund for United States veterans following a lawsuit.

In [[September 30]], [[2005]], the Vietnamese victims lodged an appeal; the Court of Appeal is due to examine it in [[March 2006]]. The funds gained should be used to finance the &quot;Peace villages&quot; in Vietnam, which each host between 50 to 100 victims, giving them medical and psychological help. As of 2006, they were 11 such Peace villages, thus granting some social protection to less than a thousand victims.

The VA &lt;!-- what is the VA? the Vietnam ASsociation? than it's VAVA... ---&gt; has listed prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, type II diabetes, Hodgkin’s disease, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, peripheral neuropathy, and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange as side effects of the herbicide.

=== South Korean lawsuit ===

In 1999,  about 20 000 [[South Korea]]ns filed two separated lawsuits against US companies, seeking more than $5 billion in damages. After losing a decision in 2002, they made [[appeal]].
In January 2006, the South Korean Appeal Court ordered Dow Chemical and Monsanto to pay '''$62 million''' in compensation to about '''6 800 people'''. The ruling acknowledged that &quot;the [[defendant]]s failed to ensure safety as the defoliants manufactured by the defendents had higher levels of dioxins than standard&quot;, and, quoting the U.S. National Academy of Science report, declared that there was a &quot;causal relationship&quot; between Agent Orange and 11 diseases, including cancers of the lung, larynx and prostate. However, the judges failed to acknowledge &quot;the relationship between the chemical and [[peripheral neuropathy]], the disease most widespread among Agent Orange victims&quot; according to the ''[[Mercury News]]''.
South Koreans was the largest foreign contingent of US allies in Vietnam, contributing some 320 000 troups. It lost 5 077 soldiers and suffered 10 962 wounded, according to the ''Mercury News''. {{ref label|MercuryNews|1|a}}

* The Uniroyal plant in [[Elmira,_Ontario|Elmira]], [[Ontario]] was one of seven suppliers producing Agent Orange for the U.S. military's use in Vietnam.

== Cultural references ==

Due to its politically sensitive nature, Agent Orange has become a common topic for reference in popular culture.

For example, the song &quot;Orange Crush&quot; by the group [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M]], and the [[punk rock|punk]] band [[Agent Orange (band)|Agent Orange]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Astronomical year numbering''' is based on [[Common Era|BCE/CE]] (or [[anno Domini|BC/AD]]) year numbering, but follows normal [[decimal]] [[integer]] numbering more strictly. Thus, it has a [[year zero|year 0]] and the years before that are designated with a minus sign '−'. The era designations BCE/CE or BC/AD are dropped. So the year 1 BCE is numbered 0, the year 2 BCE is numbered −1, and in general the year ''n'' BCE is numbered (1−''n''). The numbers of CE years are not changed, but CE (or AD) is not used, being replaced by either no sign or a positive sign. For normal calculation a [[0 (number)|number zero]] is often needed, here most notably when calculating the number of years in a period that spans the [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]; the end years need only be subtracted from each other.

The system is so named due to its use in [[astronomy]]. Few other sciences outside [[history]] deal with the time before year 1, exceptions being [[dendrochronology]], [[archaeology]] and [[geology]], the latter two of which use 'years before the present'. Although the absolute numerical values of astronomical and historical years only differ by one before year 1, this difference is critical when calculating astronomical events like eclipses or planetary conjunctions to determine when historical events which mention them occurred.

A zero year was first used by the [[eighteenth century]] [[France|French]] [[astronomer]]s [[Philippe de La Hire]] (1702) and [[Jacques Cassini]] (1740). However, both of these astronomers used the applicable BC/AD designations of [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]] with their year zero, thus near the epoch the years were designated 2 BC, 1 BC, 0, AD 1, AD 2, etc. They did not use −/0/+. During the [[nineteenth century]], astronomers designated years with either BC/0/AD or −/0/+. Astronomers did not exclusively use the −/0/+ system until the mid [[twentieth century]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Adam of Bremen''' (also: '''Adam Bremensis''') was one of the most important [[Germany|German]] [[medieval]] [[chronicler]]s. He lived and worked in the second half of the [[11th century]]. He is most famous for his chronicle ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'' (''Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church'').

==Background==

Little is known of his life other than hints from his own chronicles. He is believed to have come from [[Meissen]] ([[Latin]] ''Misnia'') in [[Saxony]]. The dates of his birth and death are uncertain, but he was probably born before 1050 and died on [[October 12]] of an unknown year (Possibly [[1081]], latest [[1085]]). Gathering from his chronicles, he was well familiar with a number of authors. The honorary name of ''Magister Adam'' shows that he has passed through all the stages of a higher education. It is probable that he was taught at the ''[[Magdeburg]]er Domschule''.

In 1066 or 1067 he was invited by archbishop [[Adalbert of Bremen]] to join the Church of Bremen, who Adalbert believed would improve the literary reputation of his see. Adam was accepted among the [[capitular]]s of Bremen, and by 1069 he appears as director of the cathedral's school. Soon thereafter he began to write the history of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]]/[[Hamburg]] and of the northern lands in his ''Gesta''.

Adam of Bremen benefited from his position and the missionary activity of the church of Bremen to gather all kind of information on the history and the geography of northern [[Germany]]. He benefited from a stay at the court of [[Svend Estridson]] to find informations about the history and geography of Denmark, and the Scandinavian countries.

Bremen was a major trading town, and ships, traders and missionaries went from there to many different locations. The earlier archbishopric seat in Hamburg had been attacked and destroyed several times, and thereafter the sees of Hamburg and Bremen were combined for protection. For three hundred years Hamburg, beginning with bishop [[Ansgar]], the Hamburg-Bremen archbishopric had been designated as the &quot;Mission of the North&quot; and had jurisdiction over all missions in [[Scandinavia]], North-Western [[Russia]], [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]]. Then the archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen had a falling-out with [[Pope Paschal II|the pope]] and in [[1105]] a separate archbishopric for the North was established in [[Lund]].

==Gesta==

Adam of Bremen's best-known work is the ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'' (''Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church''), which he began only after the death of the arch-bishop Adalbert. It consists of four volumes about the history of the archbishopry of Hamburg-Bremen, and the isles of the north. The first three mainly consist of [[history]] and the last one is mainly on [[geography]]. Adam based his works in part on [[Einhard]], [[Cassiodorus]] and other earlier historians' accounts, as he had the whole library of the church of Bremen at his hands. The first edition was completed in 1075/1076, of which he continued to revise and update until his death in the 1080s.

The first book gives a history from [[788]] onwards of the Church in Hamburg-Bremen, and the Christian mission in the North. This is the chief source of knowledge of the north until the 13th century. The second book continues the history, and further deals with German history between 940 and 1045. The third book is about the deeds of archbishop Adalbert and is considered a milestone in medieval biographical writing.

The fourth book, ''Descriptio insularum Aquilonis'', completed approximately in [[1075]], is about the geography, people and customs of Scandinavia, as well as updates of the progress of Christian missionaries there.  Adam was a proponent of his Churches role in Christianizing the northern people. Scandinavia had only just recently been explored by missionaries, and while perhaps created to inspire and guide future missionaries, its balanced and accurate descriptions make it one of the most important sources about pre-Christian Scandinavia. It is also the first known European record that mentions [[Vinland]], a land centuries later known as [[North America]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the book ''Ab Urbe Condita'' see ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)]]''.''

'''''Ab urbe condita''''' (AUC or a.u.c.) is [[Latin]] for &quot;from [[founding of Rome|the founding]] of the city&quot;{{Ref|numbering}} (of [[Rome]]), supposed to have happened in [[753 BC]]. It was one of several methods used for dating years in the Roman era, when the [[Roman calendar]] and the [[Julian calendar]] were in use. It appears to have  been widely replaced by the [[anno Diocletiani]] (A.D.) system which in turn was gradually superseded by the [[anno Domini]] (A.D.) system of [[Dionysius Exiguus]]. Some modern historians claim that an era ''ab urbe condita'' (from the founding of the city of Rome) did not, in reality, exist in the ancient world, and the method of reckoning the years in this way is modern.

==Significance==
[[Image:Antoninianus Philip the Arab - Seculum Novum.jpg|thumb|300px|A coin struck under [[Philip the Arab]] to celebrate ''Saeculum Novum''.]]
From emperor [[Claudius]] onwards [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]'s calculation (see below) superseded other contemporary calculations. Celebrating the anniversary of the city became part of imperial [[propaganda]]. Claudius was the first to hold magnificent celebrations in honor of the city's anniversary, in [[47]] AD, eight hundred years after the supposed founding of the city. In 147/8 [[Antoninus Pius]] held similar celebrations, and in [[248]] [[Philip the Arab]] celebrated Rome's first [[millennium]], together with [[Ludi saeculares]] for [[Rome]]'s alleged tenth [[saeculum]]. [[Coin]]s from his reign commemorate the celebrations. A coin by a contender for the imperial throne, [[Pacatianus]], explicitely states '1001', which is an indication that the citizens of the Empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a ''Saeculum Novum''. When the Roman Empire turned [[Christianity|Christian]] in the following century, this imagery came to be used in a more [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] sense.

==Calculation by Varro==
The traditional date for the [[founding of Rome]] of [[April 21]], [[753 BC]] was initiated by [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]. In practice the Romans typically dated events from the reign year of the current ruler (during the republic a [[consul]] had a term of a single year). Varro may have used the consular list with its mistakes, and called the year of the first consuls &quot;245 ''ab urbe condita''&quot; (a.u.c.), accepting the 244-year interval from [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] for the kings after the foundation of Rome. The correctness of Varro's calculation has not been proved scientifically but is still used worldwide.

==Alternative calculations==
According to [[Velleius Paterculus]] (VIII, 5) The foundation of Rome took place 437 years after the capture of Troy ([[1182 BC]]), It took place shortly before an [[eclipse]] of the Sun that was observed at Rome on [[June 25]], [[745 BC]] and had a magnitude of 50.3%. Its beginning occurred at 16:38, its middle at 17:28, and its end at 18:16.

However, according to Lucius Tarrutius of Firmum [[Romulus and Remus]] were conceived in the womb on the 23rd day of the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian month]] Choiac, at the time of a total [[eclipse]] of the [[Sun]]. (This eclipse occurred on [[June 15]], [[760s BC|763 BC]], with a magnitude of 62.5% at Rome. Its beginning took place at 6:49, its middle at 7:47 and its end at 8:51.) He was born on the 21st day of the month Thoth. The first day of Thoth fell on [[March 2]] in that year (Prof. E.J. Bickerman, [[1980]]: 115). It means that [[Rhea Silvia]]'s pregnancy lasted for 281 days. Rome was founded on the ninth day of the month Pharmuthi, which was the [[April 21|21st of April]], as universally agreed. The Romans add that about the time Romulus started to build the city, an eclipse of the Sun was observed by Antimachus, the Teian poet, on the 30th day of the lunar month. This eclipse on [[June 25]], [[745 BC]] (see above) had a magnitude of 54.6% at Teos, Asia Minor. It started at 17:49 it was still eclipsed at sunset, at 19:20. Romulus vanished in the 54th year of his life, on the Nones of Quintilis (July), on a day when the [[Sun]] was darkened. The day turned into night, which sudden darkness was believed to be an eclipse of the Sun. It occurred on [[July 17]], [[709 BC]], with a magnitude of 93.7%, beginning at 5:04 and ending at 6:57. (All these eclipse data have been calculated by Prof. Aurél Ponori-Thewrewk, retired director of the Planetarium of Budapest.) Plutarch placed it in the 37th year from the foundation of Rome, on the fifth of our [[July]], then called Quintilis, on &quot;Caprotine Nones,&quot; Livy (I, 21) also states that Romulus ruled for 37 years. He was slain by the senate or disappeared in the 38th year of his reign. Most of these have been recorded by [[Plutarch]] (''Lives'' of Romulus, Numa Pompilius and Camillus), Florus (Book I, I), Cicero (''The Republic'' VI, 22: ''Scipio's Dream''), Dio (Dion) Cassius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus (L. 2). Dio in his ''Roman History'' (Book I) confirms our data by telling that Romulus was in his 18th year of age whan he had founded Rome. Therefore, three eclipse records prove that Romulus reigned from [[746 BC]] to [[709 BC]], and Rome was founded in [[745 BC]].

[[Quintus Fabius Pictor|Q. Fabius Pictor]] (c. [[250 BC]]) tells that Roman consuls started for the first time 239 years after Rome's foundation (''Enciclopedia Italiana,'' XIV, [[1951]]: 173). Livy (I, 60) gives almost the same, 240 years for that interval. [[Polybius]], ''The Histories'' (III, 22. 1-2) tells that 28 years after the expulsion of the last Roman king (or, in the 28th year, we believe), [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] crossed over to [[Greece]], and that event is fixed to [[478 BC]] by two [[solar eclipse]]s. 

According to all these, the a.u.c. system should be handled accordingly, with due precaution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:NZ-Arapawa I.png|thumb|160px|right|Location of Arapawa Island]]
'''Arapawa Island''' is a small [[island]] located in the [[Marlborough Sounds]], at the north east tip of the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]].  
The island has a land area of 75 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (18500 acres). [[Queen Charlotte Sound, New Zealand|Queen Charlotte Sound]] defines its western side, while to the south lies [[Tory Channel]], which is on the sea route from [[Wellington]] in the [[North Island]] to [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]]).

It was from a hill on Arapawa Island in 1770 that Captain [[James Cook]] first saw the sea passage from the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the [[Tasman Sea]], which was named [[Cook Strait]].
This discovery banished the fond notion of geographers that there existed a great southern [[continent]].

From the late [[1820s]] until the mid [[1960s]], Arapawa Island was a base for [[whaling]] in the Sounds.
Perano Head on the east coast of the island was the principal whaling station for the area.
The houses built by the Perano family are now operated as tourist accommodation.

Arapawa Island is known for the breeds of pigs, sheep and goats found only on the island. The origin of these breeds is unknown, and is a matter of some speculation. Common suggestions are that they are old English breeds introduced by the early whalers, or by Captain Cook or other early explorers, which are now extinct in [[England]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Administrative law''' is the body of [[law]] that arises from the activities of [[government agency | administrative agencies]] of [[government]]. [[Government agency ]] action can include [[rulemaking]], [[adjudication]], or the [[enforcement]] of a specific [[regulation | regulatory]] agenda.  Administrative law is considered a branch of [[public law]].  As a body of law, administrative law deals with the decision-making of administrative units of government (e.g., [[tribunal]]s, [[board]]s or [[commission]]s) that are part of a state [[regulation |regulatory scheme]] in such areas as  [[international trade]], [[manufacturing]], the [[natural environment|environment]], [[tax|taxation]], [[broadcasting]], [[immigration]] and [[transport]]. Administrative law  expanded greatly during the [[twentieth century]], as legislative bodies world-wide created more [[government agency | government agencies]] to regulate the increasingly complex social, economic and political spheres of human interaction. 

==Administrative law in common law countries==

Generally speaking, most countries that follow the principles of [[common law]] have developed procedures for [[judicial review]] that limit the reviewability of decisions made by administrative law bodies.  Often these procedures are coupled with legislation or other [[common law]] doctrines that establish standards for proper [[rulemaking]].

Administrative law may also apply to review of decisions of so-called quasi-public bodies, such as non-profit corporations, disciplinary boards, and other decision-making bodies that effect the legal rights of members of a particular group or entity. 

While administrative decision-making bodies are often controlled by larger governmental units, their decisions could be reviewed by a [[court]] of general [[jurisdiction]] under some principle of [[judicial review]] based upon [[due process]] (United States) or [[fundamental justice]] (Canada). Judicial review of administrative decision, it must be noted, is different from an appeal. When sitting in review of a decision, the Court will only look at the method in which the decision was arrived at, whereas in appeal the correctness of the decision itself will be under question. This difference is vital in appreciating administrative law in common law countries.  

The scope of [[judicial review]] may be limited to certain questions of [[fairness]], or whether the administrative action is [[ultra vires]]. In terms of ultra vires actions in the broad sense, a reviewing court may set aside an administrative decision if it is [[patently unreasonable]] (under Canadian law), [[Wednesbury unreasonableness |'' Wednesbury '' unreasonable]] (under British law), or arbitrary and capricious under (U.S. [[Administrative Procedure Act]] and New York State law). Administrative law, as laid down by the Supreme Court in India, has also recognized two more grounds of judicial review which were recognized but not applied by English Courts viz. [[legitimate expectation]] and [[proportionality]]. 

The powers to review administrative decisions are usually established by statute, but were originally developed from the royal [[prerogative writ]]s of [[English law]], such as the writ of [[mandamus]] and the writ of [[certiorari]]. In certain [[Common Law]] jurisdictions, such as [[India]] or [[Pakistan]], the power to pass such writs is a Constitutionally guaranteed power. This power is seen as fundamental to the power of [[judicial review]] and an aspect of the independent [[judiciary]]. 

=== Administrative law in the United States===
''Main Article: [[American administrative law]]''

[[Image:250px-HQFTC.jpg|thumb|right|Administrative law in the United States often relates to, or arises from, so-called &quot;independent agencies&quot;- such as the Federal Trade Commission (&quot;FTC&quot;). Here is FTC's headquarters in Washington D.C.]]
In the [[United States]] legal system, many [[government agency | government agencies]] are organized under the [[executive branch]] of [[government]], rather than the [[judicial branch|judicial]] or [[legislative branch]]es. The [[United States Federal Executive Departments|departments]] under the control of the [[executive branch]], and their sub-units, are often referred to as [[government agency | executive agencies]]. The so-called [[government agency | executive agencies]] can be distinguished from the many important and powerful [[Independent Agencies of the United States Government|independent agencies]], that are created by [[statutes]] enacted by the [[U.S. Congress]].  Congress has also created [[Article I and Article III tribunals|Article I judicial tribunals]] to handle some areas of administrative law.  

The actions of [[government agency | executive agencies]] [[Independent Agencies of the United States Government|independent agencies]] are the main focus of American administrative law. In response to the rapid creation of new [[Independent Agencies of the United States Government|independent agencies]] in the early [[twentieth century]] (see discussion below),[[U.S. Congress | Congress]] enacted the [[Administrative Procedure Act]] (APA) in [[1946]]. Many of the [[Independent Agencies of the United States Government| independent agencies]] operate as miniature versions of the [[Federal Government of the United States | tripartite federal government]], with the authority to &quot;legislate&quot; (through [[rulemaking]]), [[adjudication | &quot;adjudicate&quot;]] (through administrative hearings), and to [[Executive (government)|&quot;execute&quot;]] administrative goals (through agency enforcement personnel). Because the [[United States Constitution]] sets no limits on this tripartite authority of [[government agency |administrative agencies]],[[U.S. Congress | Congress]] enacted the [[Administrative Procedure Act|APA]] to establish fair administrative law procedures to comply with the requirements of [[United States Constitution | Constitutional]] [[due process]].

The dominant [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case in the field of American administrative law is ''[[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.|Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council]]'', {{ussc|467|837|1984}}.

:''See also:'' [[Ranked list of Australian states]]

==Background and overview==

The states originated as separate British colonies prior to Federation (in 1901). Their powers are protected by the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]], and Commonwealth legislation only applies to the states where permitted by the constitution. The territories, by contrast, are from a constitutional perspective directly subject to the Commonwealth government. The Australian Parliament has powers to legislate in the territories that it does not possess in the states.

Most of the territories are directly administered by the Commonwealth government, while three (the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island) administer themselves. In the self-governing territories the Australian Parliament retains the full power to legislate, and can override laws made by the territorial institutions, which it has done on rare occasion. For the purposes of Australian (and joint Australia-New Zealand) intergovernmental bodies, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are treated as a state.

Furthermore, the distribution of powers between the Commonwealth and the territories is different from that between the Commonwealth and the states. In the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth retains the power to directly administer uranium mining and [[indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] lands, powers which it does not possess with respect to the states.

Each state has a Governor, appointed by the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]], which by convention she does on the advice of the state Premier. The Administrators of the Northern Territory and of Norfolk Island are, by contrast, appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]. The Australian Capital Territory has neither a Governor or Administrator, but the Governor-General exercises some powers that in other jurisdictions are exercised by the Governor of a state or Administrator of a territory, such as the power to dissolve the Legislative Assembly.

Each state has a [[bicameral]] [[Parliament]] except Queensland, which abolished its upper house in 1922. The lower house is called the Legislative Assembly, except in South Australia and Tasmania, where it is called the House of Assembly. Tasmania is the only state to use [[proportional representation]] for elections to its lower house; all others elect members from single member constituencies, using the
[[alternative vote]]. The upper house is called the Legislative Council, and
is generally elected from multi-member constituencies using proportional
representation. The three self-governing territories, the ACT, the Northern
Territory and Norfolk Island, have [[unicameral]] Legislative Assemblies.

The head of government of each state is called the Premier, appointed by the state's Governor. In normal circumstances the Governor will appoint as Premier whoever leads the party or coalition which exercises control of the lower house (in the case of Queensland, the only house) of the state Parliament. However, in times of constitutional crisis, the Governor can appoint someone else as Premier. The head of government of a self-governing territory is called the Chief Minister, and likewise they are appointed by the territory's Administrator, in normal circumstances to whoever controls the territory's Legislative Assembly.

[[Royal Navy|Admiral]] '''Arthur Phillip''' ([[11 October]] [[1738]] &amp;ndash; [[31 August]] [[1814]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy|naval]] officer and colonial administrator. Phillip was appointed [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] of the first European colony on the [[Australia|Australian]] continent - [[New South Wales]] - and was the founder of the city of [[Sydney]].

==Early life and naval career==

Arthur Phillip was born in [[London]] in 1738, the son of Jacob Phillip, a German-born language teacher, and his English wife, Elizabeth, who had remarried after the death of her previous husband, a Royal Navy captain. Phillip was educated at the school of the [[Greenwich Hospital]] and at the age of 13 was apprenticed to the [[merchant navy]].

Phillip joined the [[Royal Navy]] at fifteen, and saw action at the outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] at the [[Battle of Minorca]] in [[1756]]. In [[1762]] he was promoted to [[Lieutenant]], but was placed on half pay when the [[Seven Years War]] ended in [[1763]]. During this period he married, and farmed in [[Hampshire]].

In [[1774]] Phillip joined the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Navy as a captain, serving in the war against [[Spain]]. In [[1778]] England was again at war, and Phillip was recalled to active service, and in [[1779]] obtained his first command, the ''Basilisk''. He was promoted to captain in [[1781]], and was given command of the ''Europe'', but in [[1784]] he was back on half pay.

==Governor of New South Wales==

Then, in October [[1786]], Phillip was appointed captain of ''[[HMS Sirius (1786)|HMS Sirius]]'' and appointed Governor-designate of [[New South Wales]], the proposed British [[penal colony]] on the east coast of Australia. The appointment seems to have been the work of [[George Rose]], Under-Secretary of the Treasury and a neighbour of Phillip in Hampshire. He would have known of Phillip's experience in farming.

Phillip had a very difficult time assembling the fleet which was to make the eight-month sea voyage to Australia. Everything a new colony might need had to be taken, since Phillip had no real idea of what he might find when he got there. There were few funds available for equipping the expedition. His suggestion that people with experience in farming, building and crafts be included was rejected. Most of the 778 convicts were petty thieves from the London slums. Phillip was accompanied by a contingent of [[Royal Marines|marines]] and a handful of other officers who were to administer the colony.

The [[First Fleet]], of eleven ships, set sail on [[13 May]] [[1787]]. The leading ship reached [[Botany Bay]] on [[18 January]] [[1788]]. Phillip soon decided that this site, chosen on the recommendation of [[Sir Joseph Banks]], who had accompanied [[James Cook]] in [[1770]], was not suitable, since it offered no secure anchorage and had no reliable water source. After some exploration Phillip decided to go on to Port Jackson, and on [[26 January]] the marines and convicts were landed at [[Sydney Cove]], which Phillip named after [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney|Viscount Sydney]], the [[Home Secretary]].

The early days of the settlement were chaotic and difficult. With limited supplies, the cultivation of food was imperative, but the soils around Sydney were poor, the climate was unfamiliar, and moreover very few of the convicts had any knowledge of [[agriculture]]. Farming tools were scarce and the convicts were unwilling farm labourers. The colony was on the verge of outright [[starvation]] for an extended period. The marines, poorly disciplined themselves in many cases, were not interested in convict discipline. Almost at once, therefore, Phillip had to appoint overseers from among the ranks of the convicts to get the others working. This was the beginning of the process of convict emancipation which was to culminate in the reforms of [[Lachlan Macquarie]] after [[1811]].

Phillip showed in other ways that he recognised that [[New South Wales]] could not be run simply as a prison camp. Two convicts, Henry and Suzannah Kable, sought to sue the captain of one the transport ships for stealing their possessions during the voyage. Convicts in Britain had no right to sue. But Phillip not only allowed this, he found in their favour, and ordered the captain to make restitution. Phillip had said before leaving England: &quot;In a new country there will be no slavery and hence no slaves,&quot; and he meant what he said. Nevertheless, Phillip believed in discipline, and floggings and hangings were commonplace.

Phillip also had to adopt a policy towards the [[Iora]] [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal people]], who lived around the waters of [[Sydney Harbour]]. Phillip ordered that they must be well-treated, and that anyone killing Aboriginal people would be hanged. Phillip befriended an Iora man called [[Bennelong]], and later took him to England. On the beach at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], a misunderstanding arose and Phillip was speared in the shoulder: but he ordered his men not to retaliate. Phillip went some way towards winning the trust of the Iora, although the settlers were at all times treated extremely warily. Soon, [[smallpox]] and other European-introduced [[epidemic|epidemics]] ravaged the Iora population.

The Governor's main problem was with his own military officers, who wanted large grants of land, to which Phillip would not agree. The officers were expected to grow food, but they considered this beneath them. As a result [[scurvy]] broke out, and in October [[1788]] Phillip had to send ''Sirius'' to [[Cape Town]] for supplies, and strict rationing was introduced, with thefts of food punished by [[hanging]].

==Stabilising the colony==

By [[1790]] the situation had stabilised. The population of about 2,000 was adequately housed and fresh food was being grown. Phillip assigned a convict, [[James Ruse]], land at [[Rose Hill]] (now [[Parramatta]]) to establish proper farming, and when Ruse succeeded others followed. But in June [[1790]] the [[Second Fleet]] arrived with hundreds more convicts, most of them too sick to work. ''Sirius'' was wrecked in March [[1790]], depriving Phillip of vital supplies. In an attempt to relieve the overcrowding, Phillip established a satellite settlement at [[Norfolk Island]], which later developed a terrible reputation as a place of severe punishment.

By December [[1790]] Phillip was ready to return to England, but the colony had largely been forgotten in London and no instructions reached him, so he carried on. In [[1791]] he was advised that the government would send out two convoys of convicts annually, plus adequate supplies. But July, when the vessels of the [[Third Fleet]] began to arrive, with 2,000 more convicts, food again ran short, and he had to send a ship to [[Calcutta]] for supplies.

By [[1792]] the colony was well-established, though Sydney remained an unplanned huddle of wooden huts and tents. The [[whaling|whaling industry]] was established, ships were visiting Sydney to trade, and convicts whose sentences had expired were taking up farming. [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]] and other officers were importing sheep and beginning to grow wool. The colony was still very short of skilled farmers, craftsmen and tradesmen, and the convicts continued to work as little as possible, even though they were working mainly to grow their own food.

In late [[1792]] Phillip, whose health was suffering from the poor diet, at last received permission to leave, and on [[11 December]] [[1792]] he sailed in the ship ''Atlantic'', taking with him Bennelong and many specimens of plants and animals. The European population of New South Wales at his departure was 4,221, of whom 3,099 were convicts. The early years of the colony had been years of struggle and hardship, but the worst was over, and there were no further famines in New South Wales. Phillip arrived in London in May [[1793]]. He tendered his formal resignation and was granted a pension of 500 pounds a year.

==Later life==

Phillip's wife, Margaret, had died in [[1792]]. In [[1794]] he married [[Isabella Whitehead]], and lived for a time at [[Bath]]. His health gradually recovered and in [[1796]] he went back to sea, holding a series of commands and responsible posts in the wars against the French. In January [[1799]] he became a Rear-Admiral. In [[1805]], aged 67, he retired from the Navy with the rank of [[Admiral]], and spent most of the rest of his life at Bath. He continued to correspond with friends in New South Wales and to promote the colony's interests with government officials. He died at Bath in [[1814]].

Phillip was buried in St Nicholas's Church, [[Bathampton]]. Forgotten for many years, the grave was discovered in [[1897]] and the Premier of New South Wales, [[Henry Parkes|Sir Henry Parkes]], had it restored. A monument to Phillip in [[Bath Abbey]] Church was unveiled in [[1937]]. Another was unveiled at St Mildred's Church, Bread St, London, in 1932; that church was destroyed in the London Blitz in 1940, but the principal elements of the monument were re-erected at the west end of Watling Street, near [[Saint Paul's Cathedral]], in [[1968]]. There is a statue of him in the [[Royal Botanical Gardens, Sydney|Botanic Gardens, Sydney]]. There is an excellent portrait in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]. His name is commemorated in Australia by [[Port Phillip]], [[Phillip Island]] and many streets, parks and schools.

[[Alan Serle]] wrote of Phillip in the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'': &quot;Steadfast in mind, modest, without self seeking, Phillip had imagination enough to conceive what the settlement might become, and the common sense to realize what at the moment was possible and expedient. When almost everyone was complaining he never himself complained, when all feared disaster he could still hopefully go on with his work. He was sent out to found a convict settlement, he laid the foundations of a great dominion.&quot;

'''Angus''' (''Aonghas'' in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]) is one of the 32 [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] [[council areas]] of [[Scotland]], and a [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]]. The [[unitary council]] area borders onto [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Perth and Kinross]] and the [[City of Dundee]]. Main industries include [[agriculture]] and [[fishing]].

Angus was historically a [[Counties of Scotland|county]] (occasionally [[anglified]] to &quot;Forfarshire&quot;) until [[1975]] when it became a district of the [[Tayside]] [[Regions of Scotland|Region]]. In [[1996]] the region was abolished and Angus was established as a [[unitary authority]]. The former county had borders with [[Kincardineshire]] to the north-east, [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] to the north, [[Perthshire]] to the west.  Southwards, it faced [[Fife]] across the [[Firth of Tay]].

Areas similar to that of the former county are covered by the [[Angus (UK Parliament constituency)|Angus Westminster constituency]] and [[Angus (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Angus Holyrood constituency]].

The area can be split into three geographic areas. To the north and west, the topography is mountainous. This is the area of the five Angus Glens. The area is sparsely populated and the main industry is hill-farming. In the south and east, the topography consists of rolling hills bordering the sea. The area is fairly well populated with the larger towns and the City of Dundee on the coast. In between these two areas lies Strathmore, ''the Great Valley'', a fertile agricultural area, noted for potatoes, [[Angus cattle]], and soft fruit.

'''André the Giant''' ([[May 19]], [[1946]] &amp;ndash; [[January 27]], [[1993]]) was a [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and [[actor]], born '''André René Roussimoff''' in [[Molien]], [[France]].  His great size was a result of excessive [[growth hormone]], a condition known as [[pituitary gigantism]], and led to him being dubbed &quot;The Eighth Wonder of the World.&quot;  

==Career==
Born to French parents of [[Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] and [[Poland|Polish]] descent in a small farm near Ussy-sur-Marne, he left home in his adolescence to become a pro wrestler.  He was billed at a height of 7'4&quot; (2.24m) and sometimes 7'5&quot; (2.26m) with a weight which ranged from 380 to 525 pounds.  His correct height is contested but the last time he was legitimately measured at the age of 24, he was 6 feet and 9 3/4 inches tall (2.08m) &lt;sup&gt;[[#References|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;. The great exaggeration of his height probably comes from the fact that [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] was the tallest athlete in the world at the time at 7 feet and 2 inches (2.19m) and promoters wanted to bill Roussimoff as the biggest athlete in the world.  Nevertheless, the sight of him alone was enough to draw huge crowds in a day when there were only a handful of people over 6'6&quot; (1.98m). After touring the world with different promotions for many years (mostly in [[Montreal]] for Édouard Carpentier), he was signed by the World Wide Wrestling Federation (which would later change its name to the [[World Wrestling Federation]] in 1979, and is now known as [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]). On [[March 26]], [[1973]], Roussimoff made his WWF debut, defeating Buddy Wolfe in New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. He also dabbled in acting during [[1976]] and [[1977]], playing a [[Sasquatch]] (aka &quot;[[Bigfoot]]&quot;) on the television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''. By the time WWF chairman [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]] began to expand his promotion to the national level in the early [[1980s]], Roussimoff wrestled exclusively for the WWF. 

Roussimoff was a very imposing figure &amp;ndash; it is said that he never tested the full extent of his true strength because he was afraid of the damage it might cause. Despite the hype, many wrestlers have stated that while Andre might not know his full strength, he was always easy to work with in the ring, and always protected his opponents. It is also said that Roussimoff could drink an entire case of [[beer]] and not feel so much as a buzz. There were also stories of Andre drinking cases of wine until he would pass out as a way to numb the pain his condition caused him.  He would pass out in hotel lobbies, and a sheet would simply be thrown over him, as no one had the strength to move his massive body unaided.  However, there is no proof that any of these stories are true, and that while Andre was certainly a legendary drinker who loved to have a good time eating and drinking with friends, wrestling is famous for tall tales, and this could be simply another tall tale.  He was offered a professional [[American football]] contract with the [[Washington Redskins]] after a tryout in [[1974]] and seriously considered it before turning it down, reasoning that he could make far more money wrestling (which was probably true, especially at that time).

He was one of the WWF's most beloved &quot;[[face (professional wrestling)|babyfaces]]&quot; throughout the [[1970s]] and early '80s, although the legend that for 14 years never lost by pinfall or submission in a WWF ring before being pinned by [[Hulk Hogan]] on [[March 29]], [[1987]] at [[WrestleMania III]] is pure fiction, designed to hype the WrestleMania matchup to be bigger than it was.  Roussimoff had lost clean in matches outside of the parameters of the WWF; a pinfall loss in [[Mexico]] to El [[Canek]] in [[1984]], and in [[Japan]], a submission loss to [[Antonio Inoki]] in [[1986]], as well as a controversial no-contest finish against [[Akira Maeda]], who used heel shoot-style tactics to dominate the match.  He also went 60-minute time limit draws with the two other major world champions of the day, [[Harley Race]] and [[Nick Bockwinkel]].

Roussimoff had memorable clashes all over the world with a variety of tough, rugged opponents. Among his chief rivals in the ring: [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik]] (who gained a deathmatch win over the Frenchman in 1974 with the help of his fireball), [[Abdullah the Butcher]], [[Stan Hansen]], [[Ernie Ladd]], and a young [[Hulk Hogan]], who first met Roussimoff in 1978 during his rookie years in the deep South. Hogan and André would go on to have one of the great WWF feuds of 1980, peaking in front of 36,295 fans at the [[Showdown at Shea|Showdown At Shea]] event, on [[August 9]], [[1980]] in [[Flushing, New York]]'s [[Shea Stadium]]. 

One of André's most bitter feuds pitted him against the Mongolian terror Killer Khan, who was managed by the late [[Fred Blassie]]. According to the storyline, Khan had broken André's ankle during a match in [[Rochester, New York]], by leaping off the top rope and crashing down upon it with his kneedrop (actually, André had broken his ankle getting out of bed). After a stay at Beth-Israel Hospital in Boston, Roussimoff returned with payback on his mind. On [[November 14]], [[1981]] at the Philadelphia Spectrum, Roussimoff exacted revenge by destroying Killer Khan in what was billed as a &quot;Mongolian Stretcher Match&quot;, in which the loser must be taken to the dressing room on a stretcher.

Another memorable Roussimoff feud involved a man who considered himself to be &quot;the true giant&quot; of wrestling: the late 6'10&quot;, 364-pound [[John Minton (wrestler)|Big John Studd]]. Throughout the early to mid-1980s, Roussimoff and Studd fought all over the world, battling to try and determine who the real giant of wrestling was. In December 1984, Studd took the feud to a new level, when he and partner [[Ken Patera]] knocked out Roussimoff during a televised tag team match, and proceeded to cut off Roussimoff's famous long locks.  Roussimoff had the last laugh at the first [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]], on [[March 31]], [[1985]] at Madison Square Garden.  Roussimoff conquered Studd in a [[United States dollar|$]]15,000 Bodyslam Challenge.  After slamming Studd, he attempted to give the $15,000 prize to the fans, before having the bag stolen from him by his future manager Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan.

The following year, at [[WrestleMania 2]] ([[April 7]], [[1986]]), Roussimoff continued to display his dominance, by winning a 20-man battle royal that featured top NFL stars and wrestlers. Roussimoff eliminated future wrestling legend [[Bret Hart]] to win the contest.

Afterwards, Roussimoff continued his [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with Studd and [[Chris Pallies|King Kong Bundy]].  Roussimoff was suspended after a no-show; he returned under a mask as 'The Giant Machine' part of a team with 'Big Machine' ([[Robert Windham]]) and 'Super Machine' ([[Bill Eadie]]). (The 'Machines' gimmick was copied from [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] character 'Super Strong Machine', played by Japanese wrestler Junji Hirata.) Soon afterwards, Giant Machine disappeared and Roussimoff was reinstated, to the approval of [[Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan]].

Roussimoff was turned [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in [[1987]] so that he could face [[Hulk Hogan]] for the WWF Championship in the main event of [[WrestleMania III]]. In early 1987, Hogan was presented a trophy for being the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] for three years.  Roussimoff came out to congratulate him. Shortly afterwards, Roussimoff was presented a slightly smaller trophy for being &quot;undefeated in the WWF for 15 years.&quot; In actuality, Roussimoff had suffered a handful of countout and disqualification losses in the WWF, but had never been pinned or forced to submit in a WWF ring. Hogan came out to congratulate Roussimoff, and ended up being the focal point of the interview.  A visibly annoyed Roussimoff walked out in the midst of Hogan's speech. Then, on an edition of ''[[Piper's Pit]]'', Hogan was confronted by Heenan. Heenan announced that his new protege was Roussimoff.  Roussimoff then challenged Hogan to a title match at WrestleMania III, ripping the t-shirt and [[crucifix]] off of Hogan.

It was at WrestleMania III that the public first really saw the pain that Roussimoff was going through, by this stage his body was weighed in at about 525 pounds and his bones and joints were finding it hard supporting such a huge weight. Hogan won the match after dropping Roussimoff with a bodyslam, followed by Hogan's running legdrop finisher (years later, Hogan stated that Roussimoff was so heavy, he felt more like 700 pounds). Another famous tall tale about the match is that &quot;no one knew&quot; if Andre would lose the match.  In reality, Andre had agreed to the match a long time before, mostly for health reasons.  Before being signed to the WWF, Roussimoff had wrestled in Japan. It was here that a doctor diagnosed Roussimoff with his condition and told him that those with the same problem were generally lucky to reach forty. Roussimoff never told his family of the diagnosis and his closest friends believe that it was this motivation that led Roussimoff to live life to the fullest until he died. &lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Andre and hulk.jpg|frame|Hulk Hogan and André the Giant at Wrestlemania III]] --&gt;

The Hogan-André face off in WrestleMania III was likely the most highly anticipated professional wrestling matchup in history &amp;ndash; the apex of wrestling's most recent golden era. The event, held at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]], had millions watching on [[pay-per-view]], and established great permanent value in the WrestleMania franchise. Hogan defeated Roussimoff, in what some consider a passing of the torch from Roussimoff, wrestling's biggest star of the '70s, to Hogan, wrestling's biggest star of the '80s.  The [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between Roussimoff and Hogan simmered, even as Roussimoff's health declined.  Despite the main event, many feel that the undercard match of Ricky Steamboat challenging Randy Savage for the WWF Intercontinental Championship in retaliation for Savage &quot;crushing&quot; Steamboat's larynx months earlier after delivering his famous top rope elbowsmash on Steamboat, whom he draped over the steel guardrail designed to separate the ring area from the audience.  The commonly and frequently repeated figure of &quot;93, 173&quot; has been proven false many times over, another &quot;white lie&quot; designed to &quot;prove&quot; to the media how popular the WWF is.  In reality, the Silverdome can't handle that many people in any situation.  The real figure is somewhere in the 67,000-78,000 range, depending on the source asked.

Roussimoff won the WWF title from Hogan on [[February 5]], [[1988]] in a match where appointed [[referee]] Dave Hebner was &quot;detained backstage&quot; and a replacement, his &quot;evil&quot; twin brother Earl, made a three count on Hogan while his shoulders were off of the mat. Roussimoff then &quot;sold&quot; the title to &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; [[Ted DiBiase]] and the title was vacated.  This was shown on the WWF's NBC program &quot;The Main Event&quot; (usually seen Saturdays as &quot;Saturday Night's Main Event&quot;).  Andre famously mistakenly called the Federation's Championship the &quot;WWF Tag Team Championship&quot;, perhaps foreshadowing his regin with Haku. 

At [[WrestleMania IV]], Roussimoff and Hulk Hogan went to a double DQ in a WWF title tournament match.  Afterwards, Roussimoff and Hogan's feud died down after a brutal steel cage match held at ''WrestleFest'', on [[July 31]], [[1988]] in Milwaukee.

André won the World Tag Team Championship with his partner [[Uliuli Fitita|Haku]] from [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]], on [[December 13]], [[1989]]. Managed by Bobby Heenan, André and Haku were known as The Colossal Connection. They lost their titles at [[WrestleMania VI]] back to [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]], on [[April 1]], [[1990]].  Roussimoff had a falling out with Heenan and soon left the WWF altogether.  He went back to Japan, this time for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]], where he briefly teamed with owner [[Giant Baba]], who despite his name was only a giant when compared to the average Japanese.

André starred in several [[film|movies]] towards the end of his career, most notably as Fezzik in 1987's ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.  He had a [[cameo appearance]] in [[1984]]'s ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' as Dagoth, the resurrected horned giant beast, which is killed by Conan, the character portrayed by  [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].  In his final film, he appeared in something of a cameo role as a [[circus]] giant in the [[comedy]] ''[[Trading Mom]]'', which was not released until the year after his death.

The disease that granted him his immense size also began to take its toll on his body.  By the late 1980s André was in constant, near-crippling pain and his heart struggled to pump blood throughout his massive body. When he was not in front of a camera, he was usually in a wheelchair.

He stopped competing entirely in the very early [[1990s]] due to the increasing pain his illness was causing him, retiring to his [[winery]] in [[France]].  His heart finally failed him in [[1993]], and Roussimoff passed away in his sleep at a [[hotel]] in [[Paris]] while in town for his father's funeral.  He was cremated and his ashes were spread over his ranch in [[Ellerbe, North Carolina]].

== Legacy ==

To honor André the Giant, the WWF created the [[WWF Hall of Fame]] in 1993 and made him their first inductee.

André was the inspiration for the 1998 movie ''[[My Giant]]'', written by his friend [[Billy Crystal]], whom he had met during the filming of ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.

Even in death, Andre was memorable.  Due to his immense size, no crematorium in France could accommodate his final wishes to be cremated within 48 hours of his passing.  Instead, Andre would lie in state for nearly a week while preparations were made, to include a custom casket.  Andre's body was to be flown to North Carolina, and airlines had to reshuffle some schedules and cargo to be able to be under the weight limit with Andre on board.  Even his ashes weighed nearly twice that of a normal-sized human's ashes.

In the early '90s, shortly after his death, Andre The Giant became somewhat of a figure of social commentary, thanks in part to the [[Andre The Giant Has A Posse]] (Later known as the OBEY) sticker campaign.

==Personal Life==
While always being referred to as a &quot;bachelor for life,&quot; Roussimoff did have a daughter, Robin Christensen, born in [[1979]], who stands at around 6 feet tall herself, which has been mentioned in some biographies of André. WWE referee Tim White mentioned in the A&amp;E biography of &quot;Andre the Giant&quot; that she lives somewhere in the Seattle, Washington area. Andre also has 2 nephews, Boris and Godefroy.

'''Adrastea''' ''(ad'-rə-stee'-ə,'' {{IPA2|ˌædrəˈstiə}}, Greek ''Αδράστεια),'' or '''Jupiter&amp;nbsp;XV''', is the second of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]'s known [[natural satellite|moon]]s (counting outward from the planet). It was discovered on [[Voyager 2]] probe photographs taken in [[1979]] and received the designation '''S/1979&amp;nbsp;J&amp;nbsp;1''' ([http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/03400/03454.html IAUC 3454]) after the discovery had been announced in ''Science'' (vol. 206, p. 951, November 23, 1979). In [[1983]] it was officially named after the mythological [[Adrastea (mythology)|Adrastea]], daughter of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] and [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]]. 

It is the smallest of the [[inner satellites of Jupiter]].

Adrastea is the first natural satellite to be discovered through the use of images taken by an interplanetary spacecraft, rather than through telescopic photography.

Adrastea is inside Jupiter's [[planetary ring]] and may be the source of some of its material. Its orbit lies inside Jupiter's synchronous orbit radius, and as a result tidal forces are slowly causing its orbit to decay. It is also within Jupiter's [[Roche limit]], but is small enough to avoid tidal disruption.

'''Apache HTTP Server''' is a  [[free software]]/[[open-source software|open source]] [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] [[web server]] for [[Unix]]-like systems ([[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], [[Linux]], and [[Unix|UNIX systems]]), [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Novell NetWare]] and other platforms. Apache is notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of the [[World Wide Web]], and continues to be the most popular web server in use, serving as the reference platform against which other web servers are designed and judged.

Apache features highly configurable error messages, [[Database management system|DBMS]]-based authentication databases, and [[content negotiation]]. It is also supported by several [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) which permit easier, more intuitive configuration of the server.

The Apache HTTP Server is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the [[Apache Software Foundation]].

==History==
Apache web server was originally created by [[Robert McCool|Rob McCool]], who was heavily involved with the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] web server, known simply as [[NCSA HTTPd]]. When Rob left NCSA in mid-1994, the development of httpd stalled, leaving a variety of patches for improvements circulating through e-mails.

Rob McCool was not alone in his efforts. Several other developers helped form the original &quot;Apache Group&quot;: [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Roy Fielding|Roy T. Fielding]], [[Rob Hartill]], David Robinson, Cliff Skolnick, Randy Terbush, Robert S. Thau, Andrew Wilson, Eric Hagberg, Frank Peters, and Nicolas Pioch.

The author claims the name was initially chosen as a catchy name in order to be original, but the most widespread interpretation (which almost immediately surfaced) is that the name comes from the fact that when it was developed in early [[1995]], it consisted of changes in the code to the most popular HTTP server of the time, [[NCSA HTTPd]] 1.3 and was therefore &quot;a patchy&quot; server. However, in the FAQ on the server's official site, it is stated: &quot;The name 'Apache' was chosen from respect for the Native American Indian tribe of [[Apache]] (Indé), well-known for their superior skills in warfare strategy and their inexhaustible endurance&quot;.

At the time, Apache was the only viable [[open source]] alternative to the [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] web server (currently known as [[Sun Java System Web Server]]). It has since evolved to rival other [[Unix]]-based [[HTTP]] servers in terms of functionality and performance. Since April [[1996]] Apache has been the most popular HTTP server on the [[Internet]]. By May [[1999]] Apache installations served 57% of all [[web site]]s. Its popularity continued to rise, and in February 2006 Apache served 68% of all [[web site]]s ([http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2006/02/02/february_2006_web_server_survey.html Netcraft Web Server Survey, February 2006]). [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Information Services]] (IIS) is the main competitor to Apache, trailed by Sun Microsystem's [[Sun Java Web Server]] and a host of other applications such as [[Zeus Web Server|Zeus]].

==License==
{{main|Apache License}}

The [[Open-source license|License]] under which software from the Apache Foundation is distributed is a distinctive part of the Apache HTTP Server's history and presense in the open source software environment. The Apache License is atypical in that it allows for the distribution of both open- and closed-source [[Fork (software development)|derivations]] of the source code.

Furthermore, it is perhaps surprising that the [[Free Software Foundation]] does not consider the Apache License to be &quot;compatible&quot; with the [[GPL]], meaning that software licensed under the Apache License cannot be integrated with software that is distributed under the GPL. Here is what the FSF says about the Apache License:

:This is a free software license but it is incompatible with the GPL. The Apache Software License is incompatible with the GPL because it has a specific requirement that is not in the GPL: it has certain patent termination cases that the GPL does not require. (We don't think those patent termination cases are inherently a bad idea, but nonetheless they are incompatible with the GNU GPL.)

==Usage==
Apache is primarily used to serve static and [[Dynamic Web page|dynamic]] content on the World Wide Web. Many [[Web application|web applications]] are designed expecting the environment and features that Apache provides.

Apache is the web server component of the popular [[web server application stack]] called [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]] ([[Linux]], Apache, [[MySQL]], [[PHP]]/[[Perl]]/[[Python programming language|Python]]).

Apache is redistributed as part of various [[proprietary software|proprietary]] packages,for example: the [[Oracle database]] or the [[International Business Machines|IBM]] [[WebSphere]] [[application server]]. [[Mac OS X]] integrates Apache as its built-in web server. It is also supported in some way by [[Borland]] in the [[Kylix programming tool|Kylix]] and [[Delphi programming language|Delphi]] development tools. Apache is included with [[Novell Netware]] 6.5, where it is the default web server.

Apache is used for many other tasks where content needs to be made available in a secure and reliable way. One example is sharing files off of a personal computer over the Internet. A user who has Apache installed on their desktop can put arbitrary files in the Apache's document root which can then be shared.

Programmers developing web applications often use a locally installed version of Apache in order to preview and test code as it is being developed.

==Features==
Apache supports a variety of features, many implemented as compiled modules which extend the core functionality.  These can range from server-side programming language support to authentication schemes.  Some common language interfaces support [[mod_perl|Perl]], [[mod_python|Python]], [[Apache Rivet|Tcl]], and [[PHP]].  Popular authentication modules include mod_access, mod_auth, and mod_digest.  A sample of other features include [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] support (mod_ssl), a [[proxy server|proxy]] module, a useful URL rewriter (also known as a [[rewrite engine]], implemented under mod_rewrite), custom log files (mod_log_config), and filtering support (mod_include and mod_ext_filter).  Apache logs can be analysed through a web browser using free scripts such as [[AWStats]] or [[Visitors]].

==Apache 2==
Version 2 of the Apache server was written from scratch and contains no code from NCSA. The Apache 2.x core has several major enhancements over Apache 1.x. These include [[Thread (computer science)|UNIX threading]], better support for non-Unix platforms (such as Windows), a new Apache [[application programming interface|API]], and [[IPv6]] support.

Version 2.2 introduced a new auth API that allows for more flexibility, it also features improved cache modules and proxy modules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Arbroath_Abbey1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Arbroath Abbey, showing distinctive [[sandstone]] colouring.]]
'''Arbroath Abbey''' was founded in [[1178]] by [[William I of Scotland|King William the Lion]] for a group of [[Tironesian]] [[Benedictine]] monks from [[Kelso Abbey]].  It was [[consecration|consecrated]] in [[1197]] with a dedication to the deceased [[Thomas Becket|Saint Thomas Becket]], whom the king had met at the [[England|English]] court.  It was William's only personal foundation &amp;mdash; he was buried within its precincts in [[1214]].

The last Abbot was [[Cardinal]] [[David Beaton]], who in [[1522]] succeeded his uncle James to become Archbishop of [[St Andrews]].  The Abbey is cared for by [[Historic Scotland]] and is open to the public throughout the year.  The distinctive red [[sandstone]] ruins stand at the top of the High Street in Arbroath.

==History==

King William gave the Abbey independence from its [[mother church]] and endowed it generously, including income from 24 parishes, land in every royal burgh and more.  The Abbey's monks were allowed to run a market and build a harbour.  King [[John of England]] gave the Abbey permission to buy and sell goods anywhere in [[England]] (except [[London]]) toll-free.

The Abbey, which was the richest in [[Scotland]], is most famous for its association with the [[1320]] [[Declaration of Arbroath]], believed to have been drafted by Abbot [[Bernard de Linton]], who was the Chancellor of Scotland under King [[Robert I]].

Since [[1947]], a pageant commemorating the Declaration's signing has been held within the roofless remains of the Abbey church.  The celebration is run by the local [[Arbroath Abbey Pageant Society]], and tells the story of the events which led up to the signing.  The Pageant is not an annual event (most recent performance 2005).

The Abbey fell into ruin after the [[Reformation]].  From [[1590]] onward, its stones were raided for buildings in the town of [[Arbroath]].  This continued until [[1815]] when steps were taken to preserve the remaining ruins.  

On [[Christmas]] Day [[1950]], the [[Stone of Destiny]] was stolen from [[Westminster Abbey]]. On [[April 11]], [[1951]], the missing stone was found lying on the site of the Abbey's altar.

==Architectural Description==
[[Image:Arbroath_Abbey2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Arbroath Abbey, showing The Round 'O'.]]
The Abbey was built over some sixty years using local red sandstone, but gives the impression of a single coherent, mainly '[[Early English]]' architectural design, though the round-arched processional doorway in the western front looks back to late [[Normans|Norman]] or transitional work.  The [[triforium]] (open arcade) above the door is unique in Scottish medieval architecture.  It is flanked by twin towers decorated with blind arcading.  The [[cruciform]] church measured 276 feet long by 160 feet wide.  What remains of it today are the [[sacristy]], added by Abbot Paniter in the 15th century, the southern [[transept]], which features Scotland's largest lancet windows, part of the [[choir]] and [[presbytery]], the southern half of the [[nave]], parts of the western towers and the western doorway.
The church originally had a central tower and (probably) a spire.  These would once have been visible for many miles over the surrounding countryside, and no doubt once acted as a sea-mark for ships.  The soft sandstone of the walls was originally protected by plaster internally and render externally.  These coatings are long gone and much of the architectural detail is sadly eroded, though detached fragments found in the ruins during consolidation give an impression of the original refined, rather austere, architectural effect.

The distinctive round window high in the south transept was originally lit up at night as a [[beacon]] for mariners.  It is known locally as the 'Round O', and from this tradition inhabitants of [[Arbroath]] are colloquially known as 'Reid Lichties' (Scots reid = red).

Little remains of the claustral buildings of the Abbey except for the impressive gatehouse, which stretches between the south-west corner of the church and a defensive tower on the High Street, and the still complete Abbot's House, a building of the 13th, 15th and 16th centuries, which is the best-preserved of its type in [[Scotland]].

In the summer of [[2001]] a new visitors' centre was opened to the public beside the Abbey's west front.  This red sandstone-clad building, with its distinctive 'wave-shaped' organic roof, planted with sedum, houses displays on the history of the Abbey and some of the best surviving stonework and other relics.  The upper storey features a scale model of the Abbey complex, a computer-generated 'fly-through' reconstruction of the church as it was when complete, and a viewing gallery with excellent views of the ruins.  The centre won the [[2002]] Angus Design Award.  An archaeological investigation of the site of the visitors' centre before building started revealed the foundations of the medieval precinct wall, with a gateway, and stonework discarded during manufacture, showing that the area was the site of the masons' yard while the Abbey was being built.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Atlas Computer''' of the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]]  became operational in [[1962]], as a joint development between the University, [[Ferranti]] and [[Plessey]]. It was arguably the fastest computer in the world until the release of the [[CDC 6600]]. It was    said at the time that whenever it went offline half of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] computer capacity was lost.  It was a second-generation computer, using [[transistor]]s.

Two other Atlas machines were built: one for [[BP|British Petroleum]] and the [[University of London]] and one for the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] at Chilton near [[Oxford]]. A derivative system was built by Ferranti for [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], called the [[Titan (computer)|Titan]], which had a different memory organisation, and ran a [[time-sharing]] operating system developed by Cambridge Computer Laboratory.

The University of Manchester's Atlas system was eventually decommissioned in [[1971]].

==Technical description==

===Hardware===

The machine had many innovative features but the key operating parameters were:
* 48-bit [[word size]]
* 24-bit [[address space]]
* 16[[Kilo|K]] words of [[magnetic core memory|core store]] (equivalent to 96 [[kilobyte|KB]]), featuring interleaving of odd/even addresses
* 96K words of [[drum memory|drum store]] (eqv. to 576 KB), split across four drums but integrated with the core store using [[virtual memory]] and [[paging]] techniques
* Capability for the addition of (for the time) sophisticated new [[peripheral]]s such as [[magnetic tape]]
* Addressing of peripherals through Vstore addresses and [[extracode]] routines

It did not use a synchronous clocking mechanism so performance measurements were not easy but as an example:
* [[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] [[processor register|register]] add &amp;mdash; 1.59 [[microsecond]]s
* [[Floating-point]] add, no modification &amp;mdash; 1.61 microseconds
* Floating-point add, double modify &amp;mdash; 2.61 microseconds
* Floating-point multiply, double modify &amp;mdash; 4.97 microseconds 

===Extracode===

One interesting feature of the Atlas was '''extracode''', a system that allowed new instructions to be added in software.

The uppermost ten [[bit]]s of an Atlas machine instruction denoted which operation should be performed. If the [[most significant bit]] was set to [[0 (number)|zero]], this was an ordinary machine instruction executed directly by the hardware.

If the uppermost bit was set to [[1 (number)|one]], this was an Extracode and was implemented as a special kind of [[subroutine]] jump to an [[memory address|address]] in the fixed store ([[Read-only memory|ROM]]) where that address was determined by the other nine bits. Extracode mode had its own [[program counter|program address counter]].

Many of the extracodes were what we would probably call [[microcode]]s nowadays; they were simple arithmetic [[procedures]] which would have been too inefficient to implement in [[computer hardware|hardware]]. However, about half of the codes were designated as Supervisor functions which invoked [[operating system]] procedures. Typical examples would be &quot;Print the character specified on the stream specified&quot; or &quot;Read a block of 512 words from logical tape N&quot;. 

Extracodes were the only means that a [[computer program|program]] could communicate with the Supervisor program.

Modern Intel-type CPUs have a mechanism which is similar in principle but termed 'interrupts'. This is a bad and unhelpful name, as it leads to confusion with [[interrupt|hardware interrupt]]s.

===Software===

A unique [[Supervisor]] software system managed the computer's processing time (as such it qualifies in modern terminology as an advanced [[scheduling|job scheduler]], or a simple [[operating system]]).

One of the first [[high level language]]s available on Atlas was named [[Atlas Autocode]], which was contemporary to Algol60 and created specifically to address what Tony Brooker perceived to be some defects in that language. The Atlas did however support [[Algol 60]], as well as [[Fortran]] and [[COBOL]]. Being a university machine it was patronised by a large number of the student population who even had access to a protected [[machine code]] development environment.

&lt;!-- What other [[operating system]]s and [[programming language]]s were available on the Atlas? [[CPL]] was intended to be made available. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Accountancy''' ([[profession]]) or '''accounting''' (methodology) is the measurement, disclosure or provision of assurance about information that helps managers and other decision makers make resource allocation decisions.  [[Financial accountancy | Financial accounting]] is one branch of accounting and historically has involved processes by which financial information about a business is recorded, classified, summarized, interpreted, and communicated.  [[Financial audit|Auditing]], a related but separate discipline, is the process whereby an independent auditor examines an organization's financial statements in order to express an opinion -- that conveys reasonable but not absolute assurance -- as to the fairness and adherence to [[generally accepted accounting principles]], in all material respects.

Practitioners of accountancy are known as '''accountants'''. Officially [[license]]d accountants are recognized by titles such as ''[[Chartered Accountant]]'' (UK, Canada, India), ''[[Certified Public Accountant]]'' (US), ''[[Certified Management Accountant]]'' (Canada),   or ''[[Certified General Accountant]]'' (Canada). The majority of &quot;public&quot; accountants in Canada are Chartered Accountants; however, Certified General Accountants are also authorized by legislation to practise public accounting and auditing in all Canadian provinces, except Ontario and Quebec, as of 2005.

Accountancy attempts to create accurate [[financial statement|financial reports]] that are useful to managers, regulators, and other [[stakeholder]]s such as [[shareholder]]s, [[creditor]]s, or owners. The day-to-day record-keeping involved in this process is known as bookkeeping.

At the heart of modern financial accounting is the [[double-entry book-keeping]] system.
This system involves making at least two entries for every transaction: a debit in one account, and a corresponding credit in another account. The sum of all debits should always equal the sum of all credits. This provides an easy way to check for errors. This system was first used in medieval [[Europe]], although claims have been made that the system dates back to [[Ancient Greece]].

According to critics of [[standard accounting practices]], it has changed little since. [[Accounting reform]] measures of some kind have been taken in each generation to attempt to keep bookkeeping relevant to capital assets or production capacity. However, these have not changed the basic principles, which are supposed to be independent of [[economics]] as such.

==History==
Accountancy's infancy dates back to the earliest days of [[human]] [[agriculture]] and [[civilization]] (the [[Sumerians]] in [[Mesopotamia]]), when the need to maintain accurate records of the quantities and relative values of agricultural products first arose.

The art of accountancy based upon a [[logic]]al [[mathematic]] [[system]] ([[double-entry book-keeping]]) must certainly have been understood in [[Italy]] before 1495, when [[Luca Pacioli]] (1445 - 1517), also known as Friar Luca dal Borgo, published at [[Venice]] his treatise on book-keeping.

The first known [[English language|English]] book on the science was published in [[London]] by John Gouge or Gough in 1543. It is described as ''A Profitable Treatyce called the Instrument or Boke to learn to knowe the good order of the kepyng of the famouse reconynge, called in Latin, Dare and Habere, and, in English, Debitor and Creditor''.

A short book of instructions were also published in 1588 by [[John Mellis]] of [[Southwark]], in which he says, &quot;I am but the renuer and reviver of an ancient old copie printed here in London the 14 of August 1543: collected, published, made, and set forth by one Hugh Oldcastle, Scholemaster, who, as appeareth by his treatise, then taught Arithmetics, and this booke in Saint Ollaves parish in Marko Lane.&quot; John Mellis refers to the fact that the principle of accounts he explains (which is a simple system of double entry) is &quot;after the forme of Venice&quot;.

The very interesting and able book described as ''The Merchants Mirrour, or directions for the perfect ordering and keeping of his accounts formed by way of Debitor and Creditor'', after the (so termed) Italian manner, by Richard Dafforne, accountant, published in 1635, contains many references to early books on the science of accountancy.  In a chapter in this book, headed &quot;Opinion of Book-keeping's Antiquity,&quot; the author states, on the authority of another writer, that the form of book-keeping referred to had then been in use in Italy about two hundred years, &quot;but that the same, or one in many parts very like this, was used in the time of Julius Caesar, and in Rome long before.&quot; He gives quotations of Latin book-keeping terms in use in ancient times, and refers to &quot;ex Oratione Ciceronis pro Roscio Comaedo&quot;; and he adds: 

:&quot;That the one side of their booke was used for Debitor, the other for Creditor, is manifest in a certain place, ''Naturalis Historiae Plinii'', lib. 2, cap. 7, where hee, speaking of Fortune, saith thus: 

: ''Huic Omnia Expensa.''
: ''Huic Omnia Feruntur accepta et in tota Ratione mortalium sola ''
: ''Utramque Paginam facit.&quot;''

An early Dutch writer appears to have suggested that double-entry book-keeping was even in existence among the Greeks, pointing to scientific accountancy having been invented in remote times.

There were several editions of Richard Dafforne's book printed---the second edition having been published in 1636, the third in 1656, and another was issued in 1684. The book is a very complete treatise on scientific accountancy, it was beautifully prepared and contains elaborate explanations; the numerous editions tend to prove that the science was highly appreciated in the 17th century. From this time there has been a continuous supply of literature on the subject, many of the authors styling themselves accountants and teachers of the art, and thus proving that the professional accountant was then known and employed.

Very early in the 18th century, the services of an accountant practising in the city of [[London]] were made use of in the course of an investigation into the transactions of a director of the [[South Sea Bubble|South Sea Company]], who had been dealing in the company's stock. During this investigation the accountant appears to have examined the books of at least two firms of merchants. His report is described Observations made upon examining the books of Sawbridge and Company, by Charles Snell, Writing Master and Accountant in Foster Lane, London. The United States owes the concept of the Certified Public Accountant designation to England which had coined the Chartered Accountant designation in the 19th century.

==Accountancy qualifications and regulation==
The requirements for entry in the profession of accounting vary from country to country.

=== Commonwealth of Nations ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and several other [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries, the equivalents of Certified Public Accountant (CPA) include [[Chartered Accountant]] (CA - in UK, Commonwealth and former British states), Chartered Certified Accountant (ACCA - United Kingdom), International Accountant (AIA - United Kingdom), Certified Public Accountant (CPA - Ireland and CPA - Hong Kong), Certified General Accountant (CGA - Canada), and Certified Practising Accountant (CPA - Australia). 

Please refer to the latest statutory auditing rights of above accounting bodies in individual jurisdictions and distinction from non-audit bodies for various consumers. In UK, only 3 chartered accountants (England &amp; Wales, Scottish and Irish)and their equivalents (AIA and ACCA) are &quot;Registered Auditors&quot; under Companies Act.

ACA is the best known and most respected qualification in the UK, equivalent of a CA but handled by a different board ICAEW.

====Canada====
In Canada, there are three recognized accounting bodies: the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CA) and the provincial and territorial CA Institutes, the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada (CGA)]], and the Society of Management Accountants of Canada (CMA). CA and CGA were created by Acts of Parliament in 1902 and 1913 respectively and CMA was established in 1920.

The CA program focuses on public accounting and candidates must obtain auditing experience from public accounting firms; the CGA program takes a general approach allowing candidates to focus in their own financial career choices; the CMA program focuses in management accounting.  Both the CA and the CMA programs require a candidate to obtain a degree as a program entry requirement. The CGA program only requires a degree as an exit requirement prior to certification.

Auditing and Public Accounting are regulated by the provinces. Historically, only CAs can perform audits in [[Ontario]]. In 2004, the provincial government of [[Ontario]] passed a new Public Accounting Act that would allow qualified CGAs and CMAs to perform audits, conditional on their organizations being able to demonstrate that their qualification and regulatory programs are equivalent in rigour to that of the CA program. As of March 2006, this process of evaluation had not yet begun.  In [[Quebec]] as well, CAs still have exclusive public company audit rights by statute. In [[British Columbia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], CAs and CGAs have equal status regarding public accounting and auditing; In the rest of [[Canada]], CAs, CGAs, and CMAs are considered equivalents pursuant to provincial and territorial legislation.

===United States of America===
In the [[United States]], practicing accountants include [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPAs), [[Certified Internal Auditor]]s (CIAs), [[Certified Management Accountant]]s (CMAs) and [[Accredited Business Accountant]]s (ABAs).  The difference between these certifications is primarily the types of services provided, although individuals may earn more than one certification.  Additionally, much accounting work is performed by uncertified individuals, who may be working under the supervision of a certified accountant.

A CPA is licensed by the state of his/her residence to provide auditing services to the public, although most CPA firms also offer accounting, tax, litigation support, and other financial advisory services.  The requirements for receiving the CPA license varies from state to state, although the passage of the Uniform Certified Public Accountant examination is required by all states. This examination is designed and graded by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]].

A CIA is granted a certificate from the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), provided that the candidate passed a rigorous examination of four parts. A CIA mostly provides his/her services directly to his/her employer rather than the public.

A CMA is granted a certificate from the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA), provided that the candidate passed a rigorous examination of four parts and meet the practical experience requirement from the IMA.  A CMA mostly provides his/her services directly to his/her employers rather than the public.  A CMA can also provide his services to the public, but to an extent much lesser than that of a CPA.

An ABA is granted accreditation from the Accreditation Council for Accountancy and Taxation (ACAT), provided that the candidate passed the eight-hour Comprehensive Examination for Accreditation in Accounting which tests proficiency in financial accounting, reporting, statement preparation, taxation, business consulting services, business law, and ethics. An ABA specializes in the needs of small-to-mid-size businesses and in financial services to individuals and families. In states where use of the word &quot;accountant” is not permitted, the practitioner may use Accredited Business Advisor.

The [[United States Department of Labor]]'s [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] estimates that there are about one million persons [http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes132011.htm] employed as accountants and auditors in the U.S.

U.S. [[tax law]] grants accountants a limited form of [[accountant-client privilege]].

==The &quot;Big Four&quot; accountancy firms==
The &quot;[[Big 4 accountancy firm|Big Four auditor]]s&quot; are the largest [[multinational]] accountancy firms.  
*[[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]
*[[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu]]
*[[Ernst &amp; Young]]
*[[KPMG]] 

The Big 4 accountancy firms can all trace their history back to firms in Europe, from which they have descended through a long line of mergers.  Many of the originating firms were from the [[United Kingdom]].   As British trade interests expanded, correspondent firms were established throughout the world by the organisations.  These firms are associations of the  partnerships in each country rather than having the classical structure of holding company and subsidiaries, but each has an international 'umbrella' organisation for co-ordination.  However, due to the dominant size of the [[Economy of the United States|United States' economy]], the offices of the Big 4 accountancy firms based in the United States have always generated more revenue than the rest of the Big 4 accountancy firms' offices in the world combined. 

Before the Enron and other [[accounting scandals]], there were five large firms and were called the Big Five. Since [[Arthur Andersen]]'s [[Assurance services|assurance]] practice split, with a plurality joining KPMG in the US and Deloitte &amp; Touche outside of the US, Arthur Andersen left from the group.  Previous to this there were also groupings referred to as the &quot;Big Six&quot; and the &quot;Big Eight&quot;.

Enron turned out to be only the first of a series of accounting scandals that enveloped the accounting industry in 2002.

This is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. accounting industry. Application of [[International Accounting Standards]] originating in [[International Accounting Standards Board]] headquartered in [[London]] and bearing more resemblance to UK than current [[US GAAP|US practices]] is often advocated by those who note the relative stability of the U.K. accounting system (which reformed itself after scandals in the late 1980s and early 1990s). [[Accounting reform]] of a far more comprehensive sort is advocated by those who see issues with [[capitalism]] or [[economics]], and seek ecological or social accountability.

'''Ants''' are one of the most successful groups of [[insect]]s in the [[animal kingdom]] and are of particular interest because they are a [[Eusociality|social insect]] and form highly organized [[ant colony|colonies]] or nests, sometimes consisting of millions of individuals. Colonies of invasive ant species will sometimes work together and form supercolonies, spanning a very wide area of land. Ant colonies are sometimes described as [[superorganism]]s because they appear to operate as a single entity. 

Ants have colonized almost every landmass on [[Earth]] and can constitute up to 15% of the total animal [[biomass]] of a [[tropical rainforest]]. [[As of 2006]], there are 11,844 known ant species, most of which reside in hot climates.

==Ancestry==
Ants are classified as a family, [[Formicidae]], belonging to the order [[Hymenoptera]] which also includes [[sawflies]], [[bees]] and [[wasp]]s. Ants are a lineage derived from within the [[Vespoidea|vespoid]] [[wasp]]s.  Estimates of the age of the ants derived from genetic data indicate that ants evolved from other groups of wasps in the [[Cretaceous]] period about 120 to 140 million years ago. Several fossils from the Cretaceous are intermediate in form between wasps and ants, further confirming the wasp ancestry of ants. Like other Hymenoptera, the genetic system employed by ants is [[Haplodiploidy]].

{{Sectstub}}

== Morphology ==
Ants are distinguished from other insects by the combination of elbowed [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], a strongly constricted second [[abdominal]] segment forming a distinct node-like [[petiole]], a wingless worker caste, and the presence of a [[metapleural gland]].

They can sense with [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s located on the antennae, which can detect [[pheromones]] (single compounds) and hydrocarbons on the outer layer of the body (a set of different compounds). The latter is highly important for the recognition of nestmates from non-nestmates. Also, they communicate with sound in the form of vibrations moving through the ground

Most [[Queen (insect)|queens]] and male ants have [[wing]]s, which they eat after [[nuptial flight]]; however wingless queens (ergatoids) and males can occur.

==Development==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Ants evacuating larvae.jpg|thumb|left|Ants recovering larvae after a disturbance of the nest]] --&gt;

Ants are [[Holometabolism|holometabolous]], and develop by complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]], passing through [[larva|larval]] and [[pupa|pupal]] stages before they become adults.  The larval stage is particularly helpless - for instance it lacks legs entirely - because it does not need to care for itself.  The difference between queens and workers, and between different castes of workers when they exist, is determined by feeding in the larval stage. Food is given to the larvae by a process called [[trophallaxis]] in which an ant [[Regurgitation|regurgitates]] food previously held in its crop for communal storage.  This is also how adults distribute food amongst themselves. Larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper development, and so are often moved around various brood chambers within the colony.

A new worker spends the first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young.  After that it graduates to digging and other nest work, and then to foraging and defense of the nest. These changes are fairly abrupt and define what are called temporal [[caste]]s. One theory of why this occurs is because foraging has a high death rate, so ants only participate in it when they are older and closer to death anyway.  In a few ants there are also physical castes - workers come in a spectrum of sizes, called minor, median, and major workers, the latter beginning foraging sooner.  Often the larger ants will have disproportionately larger heads, and so stronger [[mandible]]s.  Such individuals are sometimes called &quot;soldier&quot; ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting other creatures, although they are still in fact worker ants and their &quot;duties&quot; typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species the median workers have disappeared, creating a sharp divide and clear physical difference between the minors and majors.

Most of the common ant species breed in the same way. All ants in the colonies are females to begin with, but only the Queen and breeding females have the ability to mate. Contrary to popular belief, some ant nests have multiple queens.  The male ants, called drones, along with the breeding females are born with wings, and do nothing throughout their life except eat, at least until the time for mating comes. At this time, all the breeding ants in the colony are carried outside (save for the queen) where other colonies of similar species are doing the same. Then, all the winged breeding ants take flight. Mating occurs in flight and the males die shortly afterward. The females that survive land and seek a suitable place to begin a colony. There, they break off their own wings and begin to lay eggs, which they care for. Sperm obtained during their nuptial flight is stored and used to fertilise all future eggs produced. The first workers to hatch are weak and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food and care for the other eggs. This is how a new colony starts.

==Communication and behavior==
[[Image:Acrobat.ant1web..jpg|thumb|left|200px|Acrobat ant (''Crematogaster'' - Myrmecidinae)]]
[[Image:Ant mound.jpg|thumb|250px|Ant mound hole - preventing water coming into nest during rain]]
Ant communication is primarily through chemicals called [[pheromone]]s. Because most ants spend their time in direct contact with the ground, these chemical messages are more developed than in other [[Hymenopterans]]. So, for instance, when a forager finds food on its way home (found typically through remembered landmarks and the position of the [[sun]]), it will leave a trail along the ground, which in a short time other ants will follow. When they return home they will reinforce the trail, bringing other ants, until the food is exhausted, after which the trail is not reinforced and so slowly dissipates. A crushed ant will emit an alarm pheromone, that in high concentration sends other ants nearby into an attack frenzy, and in lower concentration attracts them, while a few ants use what are called propaganda pheromones to confuse their enemies.

Ant trails have no intrinsic [[polarity]]; that is to say, an ant walking on a straight non-branching trail cannot tell whether it is walking to or from the nest.  Trails always divide as a &quot;Y&quot;, with the two secondary trails at a 60 degree angle to each other, and it is the geometry at trail junctions that give ant trails polarity. (Jackson &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;, 2004)

Like other insects, ants smell with their antennae, which are long and thin. These are fairly mobile, having a distinct elbow joint after an elongated first segment, and since they come in pairs they provide information about direction as well as intensity. Pheromones are also exchanged as compounds mixed in with the food interchanged in [[trophallaxis]], giving the ants information about one another's health and nutrition. Ants can also detect what task group (e.g. foraging or nest maintenance) other ants belong to. Of special note, the queen produces a special pheromone without which the workers will begin raising new queens.

Ants attack and defend themselves by biting, and in many species, stinging, in both cases sometimes injecting chemicals into the target. Of special note here is [[formic acid]].

While many types of animals can [[learning|learn]] behaviors by [[imitation|imitating]] other animals, ants may be the only group of animals besides [[human|humans]] in which interactive [[teacher|teaching]] behavior has been observed.  Knowledgeable forager ants of the species ''Temnothorax albipennis'' directly lead naive nestmates to newly discovered food sources by an excruciatingly slow (and time-costly), process of 'tandem running'. The follower thereby obtains knowledge that it would not have, had it not been tutored, and this is at the expense of its nestmate teacher. Both leader and follower are acutely sensitive to the progress of their partner. For example, the leader slows down when the follower lags too far behind, and speeds up when the follower gets too close, whereas the follower does the opposite (Franks and Richardson, 2006).

==Ant cooperation and competition==

Some species of ant are known for attacking and taking over the colonies of others ant species. Others are less expansionist but nonetheless just as aggressive; they attack colonies to steal eggs or larvae, which they either eat or raise as workers. &lt;!-- SOURCES NEEDED: In some rare cases two species of ants have been observed working in the same colony.--&gt;

==Types==
{{commons|Ant}}
There is a great diversity among ants and their behaviors. They range in size from 2 to about 25 millimetres (about 0.08 to 1 inch). Their colour may vary, most are red or black, but other colours can also be seen. A few types, such as the genus ''Pheidole'' of [[North America]], have a metallic lustre.

See ''[[list of ant genera (alphabetical)]]'' for an alphabetical compendium of worldwide ant genera, and ''[http://atbi.biosci.ohio-state.edu:210/hymenoptera/nomenclator.name_entry?text_entry=formicidae&amp;Submit=Submit+Query antbase.org/Hymenoptera Name Server]''for a complete catalogue of all the currently known ant species of the world and their synonyms.
Antbase.org/Hymenoptera Name Server is providing an [http://atbi.biosci.ohio-state.edu:210/hymenoptera/tsa.sppcount?the_taxon=Formicidae up to date record of the actual number of species], and allows to follow [http://atbi.biosci.ohio-state.edu:210/hymenoptera/manage_lit.new_taxa_by_year?tnuid=152&amp;the_year=2005 the description of new taxa].

Of special note:
*Some of the more advanced ants are the [[army ant]]s and [[driver ant]]s, from [[South America]] and [[Africa]] respectively. Unlike most species which have permanent nests, army and driver ants do not form permanent nests, but instead alternate between nomadic stages and stages where the workers form a temporary nest ([[bivouac]]) out of their own bodies. Colonies reproduce either through nuptial flights as described above, or by fission, where a group of workers simply dig a new hole and raise new queens.  Colony members are distinguished by smell, and other intruders are usually attacked, with notable exceptions.
* Some ants will raid the colonies of other ants, taking the [[pupa|pupae]] with them, which once hatched act as workers in the raider's colonies despite not being genetically related to the queen. A few species, such as the Amazon ants (e.g. ''[[Polyergus]] rufescens''), have become utterly dependent on such slaves, to the point of being otherwise unable to feed themselves.

* Some ants, called [[honeypot ant]]s, have special workers called ''[[replete|repletes]]'' who simply store food for the rest of the colony, generally becoming immobile with greatly enlarged abdomens. In hot, dry places, even deserts, in Africa, North America and Australia where they live they are considered a great delicacy.
* [[Weaver ant]]s (''[[Oecophylla]]'') build nest in trees by attaching leaves together, first pulling them together with bridges of workers and then sewing them together by pressing silk-producing larvae against them in alternation.
* [[Leafcutter ant]]s (''[[Atta]]'' and ''[[Acromyrmex]]'') feed exclusively on a special [[fungus]] that lives only within their colonies.  They continually collect [[leaf|leaves]] which they cut into tiny pieces for the fungus to grow on. These ants have several differently sized castes especially for cutting up the pieces they are supplied with into even smaller pieces. Leaf cutter ants are sensitive enough to adapt to the fungi's reaction to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is toxic to the fungus the colony will no longer collect it. The ants grow the fungus because it produces special structures called gongylidia which are fed on by the ants.
* [[Fire ant]]s are unique by having a poison sac where the contents consists largely of piperidine alkaloids.
* [[Silver ant]]s navigate by using their eyes instead of pheromones to find their way back home.
* Some ants are equipped with mandibles called trap-jaws. This snap-jaw mechanism, or catapult mechanism, is possible because energy is stored in the large closing muscles. The blow is incredibly fast, about 0.5 ms in the genus Mystrium. Before the strike, the mandibles opens wide and are locked in the open position by the labrum, which functions as a latch. The attack is triggered by stimulation of sensory hairs at the side of the mandibles. The mandibles are also able to function as a tool for more finely adjusted tasks. Other groups other than Mystrium are Odontomachus and  Dacetini, examples on convergent evolution.
* Australian green ants are eaten by the aboriginals.Their abdomen tastes like lemon sherbet, are high in vitamin C and have antibiotic properties. Squashed green ants mashed in water makes up an excellent lemon-lime flavored drink. The Amazon is also said to have lemon ants.[http://www.sptimes.com/2002/03/03/Travel/Tracking_the_lemon_an.shtml]
* The Australian [[bulldog ant]] Myrmecia pilosula has only a single pair of chromosomes. Males have just one chromosome since they, like all male [[Hymenoptera]]ns, are haploid.

==Relationships between ants and other species==

* [[Aphid]]s secrete a sweet liquid called [[honeydew]].  Normally this is allowed to fall to the ground, but around ants it is kept for them to collect.  The ants in turn keep predators away and will move the aphids around to better feeding locations.
* [[Myrmecophile|Myrmecophilous]] or ant-loving [[caterpillar]]s (blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding areas in the daytime and brought inside the ants nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew if the ants massage them.
* Some myrmecophagous (ant-eating) caterpillars secrete a pheromone which makes the ants think the larva is one of their own. The caterpillars will then be taken into the ants' nest where they can feed on the ant larvae.
* [[Allomerus decemarticulatus]] has developed a tripartite association with their host plant and a fungus in order to ambush their prey.
* [[Fungus-growing ants]] that make up the tribe [[attini]], including [[Leafcutter ant]]s, actively cultivate certain species of fungus in the ''[[Leucoagaricus]]'' or ''[[Leucocoprinus]]'' genera of the [[Agaricaceae]] family. In this [[ant-fungus mutualism]], both species depend on each other for survival.
*[[Myrmelachista schumanni|Lemon Ant]]s make [[Devil's garden]]s by killing all surrounding plants besides lemon ant trees.
*Many trees have extra floral nectaries that provide food for ants and the ants in turn protect the plant from herbivorous insects. Some species like the bullhorn acacia (''[[Acacia cornigera]]'') in Central America have hollow thorns that serve to house colonies of stinging ants (''[[Pseudomyrmex ferruginea]]'') that defend the tree against insects, browsing mammals and epiphytic vines. In return the ants obtain  food from protein-lipid Beltian bodies.

==Humans and ants==

Ants are useful for clearing out insect pests and aerating the soil.  On the other hand, they can become annoyances when they invade homes, yards, gardens and fields.  [[Carpenter ant]]s damage [[wood]] by hollowing it out for nesting.
Nests may be destroyed by tracing the ants' trails back to the nest, then pouring boiling water into it to kill the queen. (Killing individual ants is less than effective due to the secretion of pheromones mentioned above).
Ordinary [[chalk]] can be used to keep ants at bay; drawing a line or circle around the protected area may prevent them from entering.

Some species, called ''[[killer ant]]s'', have a tendency to attack much larger animals during foraging or in defending their nests.  Human attacks are rare, but the stings and bites can be quite painful and in large enough numbers can be disabling.

Ants have often been used in fables and children's stories to represent industriousness and cooperative effort, as well as aggressiveness and vindictiveness. In parts of Africa, ants are the messengers of the gods. Ant bites are often said to have curative properties. Some [[Native American mythology|Native American religions]], such as [[Hopi mythology]], recognize ants as the very first animals. Others use ant bites in [[initiation]] ceremonies as a test of endurance.

[[Termite]]s, sometimes called &quot;white ants,&quot; are in fact not closely related to ants, though they have a somewhat similar social structure. They comprise the order [[Isoptera]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arbitration'''           is a form of [[mediation]] or [[conciliation]], where the mediating party is given power by the disputant parties to settle the dispute by making a finding.  In practice arbitration is generally used as a substitute for judicial systems, particularly when the judicial processes are viewed as too slow, expensive or biased.  Arbitration is also used by communities which lack formal law, as a substitute for formal law.

==Arbitration in the United States of America==
'''Arbitration''', in the context of United States [[law]], is a form of [[alternative dispute resolution]] &amp;mdash; specifically, a legal alternative to [[litigation]] whereby the parties to a dispute agree to submit their respective positions (through agreement or hearing) to a neutral third party (the arbitrator(s) or arbiter(s)) for resolution.

Arbitration may also serve a distinct purpose: as an alternative to strikes and lockouts as a means of resolving labor disputes. Labor arbitration comes in two varieties:  '''interest arbitration''', which provides a method for resolving disputes about the terms to be included in a new contract when the parties are unable to agree, and '''grievance arbitration''', which provides a method for resolving disputes over the interpretation and application of a [[collective bargaining agreement]].

===Commercial and other forms of contract arbitration===
Agreements to arbitrate were not enforceable at common law, though an arbitrator's judgment was usually enforceable (once the parties had already submitted the case to him or her).  During the [[Industrial Revolution]], this situation became intolerable for large [[corporations]]. They argued that too many valuable [[business]] relationships were being destroyed through years of expensive adversarial [[litigation]], in courts whose strange rules differed significantly from the informal norms and [[convention]]s of businesspeople (the private law of [[commerce]], or ''jus merchant''). Arbitration appeared to be faster, less adversarial, and cheaper.

The result was the [[New York Arbitration Act]] of [[1920]], followed by the [[United States Arbitration Act]] of [[1925]].  The USAA is now known as the [[Federal Arbitration Act]].  Thanks to the subsequent judicial expansion of the meaning of [[interstate commerce]], the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] reinterpreted the FAA in a series of cases in the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]] to cover the full scope of interstate commerce. In the process, the Court held that the FAA preempted many state laws covering arbitration, some of which had been passed by state [[legislature]]s to protect their [[consumer]]s against powerful corporations.

Since commercial arbitration is based upon either contract law or the [[law of treaties]], the agreement between the parties to submit their dispute to arbitration is a legally binding [[contract]].  All arbitral decisions are considered to be &quot;final and binding.&quot; This does not, however, void the requirements of law. Any dispute not excluded from arbitration by virtue of law (e.g. criminal proceedings) may be submitted to arbitration.

===Other forms of contract arbitration===
Arbitration can be carried out between private individuals, between states, or between states and private individuals. In the case of arbitration between states, or between states and individuals, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] and the [[International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID) are the predominant organizations. 

Arbitration is also used as part of the dispute settlement process under the [[World Trade Organization| WTO]] [[Dispute Settlement Understanding]]. International arbitral bodies for cases between private persons also exist, the [[International Chamber of Commerce Court of Arbitration]] being the most important. The [[American Arbitration Association]] is a popular arbitral body in the United States.  The [[National Arbitration Forum]] is another leading arbitration provider in the United States.  Arbitration also exists in international sport through the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]].

A growing trend among employers whose employees are not represented by a [[labor union]] is to establish an organizational problem-solving process, the final step of which consists of arbitration of the issue at point by an independent arbitrator, to resolve employee complaints concerning application of employer policies or claims of employee misconduct. Employers in the United States have also embraced arbitration as an alternative to litigation of employees' statutory claims, e.g., claims of discrimination, and common law claims, e.g., claims of defamation.

===Labor arbitration===
Arbitration has also been used as a means of resolving labor disputes for more than a century. Labor organizations in the [[United States]], such as the [[National Labor Union]], called for arbitration as early as [[1866]] as an alternative to strikes to resolve disputes over the wages, benefits and other rights that workers would enjoy. Governments have also relied on arbitration to resolve particularly large labor disputes, such as the [[Coal Strike of 1902]]. 

This type of arbitration is commonly known as interest arbitration, since it involves the mediation of the disputing parties' demands, rather than the disposition of a claim in the manner a court would act. Interest arbitration is still frequently used in the construction industry to resolve collective bargaining disputes. The [[United Steelworkers of America]] adopted an elaborate form of interest arbitration, known as the Experimental Negotiating Agreement, in the 1970s as a means of avoiding the long and costly strikes that had made the industry vulnerable to foreign competition. [[Major League Baseball]] uses a variant of interest arbitration, in which an arbitrator chooses between the two sides' final offers, to set the terms for contracts for players who are not eligible for free agency.

Unions and employers have also employed arbitration to resolve employee grievances arising under a collective bargaining agreement. The [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]] made arbitration a central element of the ''Protocol of Peace'' it negotiated with garment manufacturers in the second decade of the twentieth century. Grievance arbitration became even more popular during [[World War II]], when most unions had adopted a no-strike pledge. The [[War Labor Board]], which attempted to mediate disputes over contract terms, pressed for inclusion of grievance arbitration in collective bargaining agreements. The Supreme Court subsequently made labor arbitration a key aspect of federal labor policy.

===Securities Arbitration===
In the United States securities industry, arbitration has long been the preferred method of resolving disputes between brokerage firms, and between firms and their customers. The securities industry uses a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, where the parties agree to arbitrate their disputes before any such dispute arises. Those agreements were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Shearson v. MacMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) and today nearly all disputes involving brokerage firms are resolved in arbitration.

The process operates under its own rules, and is described in an article [http://www.seclaw.com/arbover.htm Introduction to Securities Arbitration]. Securities arbitrations are held primarily by the [http://www.nasdadr.com NASD Dispute Resolution] program and the [http://www.nyse.com New York Stock Exchange]. 

===Judicial arbitration===
Some state court systems have promulgated court-ordered arbitration; family law (particularly child custody) is the most prominent example. Judicial arbitration is often merely advisory dispute resolution technique, serving as the first step toward resolution, but not binding either side and allowing for trial de novo.   Litigation attorneys present their side of the case to an independent teritary lawyer, who issues an opinion on settlement.  Should the parties in question decide to continue to dispute resolution process, there can be some sanctions imposed from the initial arbitration per terms of the contract.

==Proceedings==
Various bodies of rules have been developed that can be used for arbitration proceedings. The two most important are the [[UNCITRAL]] rules and the ICSID rules. The rules to be followed by the arbitrator are specified by the agreement establishing the arbitration.

The [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards]] (Done at New York, [[10 June]] [[1958]]; Entered into force, [[7 June]] [[1959]]; 330 U.N.T.S. 38, 1959) provides for the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards on the territory of the contracting parties. Similar provisions are contained in the earlier [[Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards]] (Done at Geneva, [[26 September]] [[1927]]; Entered into force, [[25 July]] [[1929]]; L.N.T.S. ???).

Some jurisdictions have instituted a limited grace period during which an arbitral decision may be appealed against, but after which there can be no appeal. In the case of arbitration under international law, a right of appeal does not in general exist, although one may be provided for by the arbitration agreement, provided a court exists capable of hearing the appeal. 

When arbitration occurs under U.S. law, either party to an arbitration may appeal from the arbitrator's decision to a court, however the court will generally not change the arbitrator's findings of fact but will decide only whether the arbitrator was guilty of malfeasance, or whether the arbitrator exceeded the limits of his or her authority in the arbitral award or whether the award conflicts with positive law.  The Supreme Court has described the standard of review as one of the narrowest known to Western jurisprudence.

==Arbitrators==
Arbitrators are not bound by [[precedent]] and have great leeway in such matters as active participation in the proceedings, accepting [[evidence (law)|evidence]], questioning witnesses, and deciding appropriate remedies. Arbitrators may visit sites outside the hearing room, call [[expert witnesses]], seek out additional evidence, decide whether the parties may be represented by legal counsel, and perform many other actions not normally within the purview of a court. It is this great flexibility of action, combined with costs usually far below those of traditional litigation, which makes arbitration so attractive.

Arbitrators have wide latitude in crafting remedies in the arbitral decision, with the only real limitation being that they may not exceed the limits of their authority in their award. An example of exceeding arbitral authority might be awarding one party to a dispute the personal automobile of the other party when the dispute concerns the specific performance of a business-related contract.

It is open to the parties to restrict the possible awards that the abitrator can make. If this restriction requires a straight choice between the position of one party or the position of the other, then it is known as ''pendulum arbitration'' or ''final offer arbitration''. It is designed to encourage the parties to moderate their initial positions so as to make it more likely they receive a favourable decision.

No definitive statement can be made concerning the credentials or experience levels of arbitrators, although some jurisdictions have elected to establish standards for arbitrators in certain fields. Several independent organizations, such as the [[American Arbitration Association]], offer arbitrator training programs and thus in effect, credentials. Generally speaking, however, the credibility of an arbitrator rests upon reputation, experience level in arbitrating particular issues, or expertise/experience in a particular field. Arbitrators are generally not required to be members of the legal profession.

To ensure effective arbitration and to increase the general credibility of the arbitral process, arbitrators will sometimes sit as a panel, usually consisting of three arbitrators.  Often the three consist of an expert in the legal area within which the dispute falls (such as contract law in the case of a dispute over the terms and conditions of a contract), an expert in the industry within which the dispute falls (such as the construction industry, in the case of a dispute between a homeowner and his general contractor), and an experienced arbitrator.

==Critics==
Critics of arbitration argue that contractual requirements to arbitrate can be unfair to employees or consumers who have no power to negotiate what is often a form contract. In these cases, the choice of arbiter may be spelled out in a contract. The arbitration panel may contain industry experts who may be more sympathetic to the industry than to the individual. Also, some have argued that the fact that an arbitration company may handle many cases for a corporation while an individual rarely goes through arbitration twice may bias the arbitrators in favor of the company. On this note, many arbitration companies have these corporations as their sole source of income, further biasing their judgments. The fact that most arbitral procedures are not public, and that there may be no provision for an individual to be represented by counsel, may also work to the disadvantage of the individual. These potential disadvantages make the ethics and professionalism of arbitrators even more important.

Arbitration in the U.S. has also been criticized because of the unavailability of appellate review. Although the New York and federal arbitration laws were based on the English arbitration law of 1898, they omitted the English provision permitting for de novo review of questions of law. Thus, American courts can overturn arbitral rulings only for extremely gross procedural errors that violate [[due process]], but cannot reverse most substantive errors.

Unlike judicial opinions, arbitration opinions are often confidential. As a result, the law relating to activities (such as reinsurance contracts and certain types of securities industry disputes) where contracts to arbitrate are widespread may develop more slowly because the usual process of creating [[precedent]] is not available.

==Arbitration on TV==
The &quot;judge shows&quot; that have become popular in many countries, especially the [[United States]], are actually binding arbitration.  The most famous example is ''[[The People's Court]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{CrimPro}}
The '''adversarial system''' (or '''adversary system''') of law is the system of law, generally adopted in [[common law]] countries, that relies on the skill of the different [[jurist|advocate]]s representing their party's positions and not on some neutral party, usually the [[judge]], trying to ascertain the truth of the case. The [[inquisitorial system]] that is usually found on the continent of Europe among [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems (ie. those deriving from the Roman or [[Napoleonic Code]]s) has a judge or a group of judges who work together whose task is to investigate the case before them.   

Judges in an adversarial system tend to be more interested in ensuring the fair play of [[due process]], or [[fundamental justice]]. Such judges decide, often when called upon by counsel rather than of their own motion, what [[evidence (law)|evidence]] is to be admitted when there is a dispute; though in some common law jurisdictions judges play more of a role in deciding what evidence to admit into the record or reject. At worst, abusing [[judicial discretion]] would actually pave the way to a biased decision rendering obsolete the judicial process in question &amp;mdash; [[rule of law]] being illicitly subordinated by [[rule of man]] under such discriminating circumstances.   

The rules of evidence are also developed based upon the system of objections of adversaries and on what basis it may tend to prejudice the [[trier of fact]] which may be the judge or the jury. In a way the rules of evidence can function to give a judge limited inquisitorial powers as the judge may exclude evidence he/she believes is not trustworthy or irrelevant to the legal issue at hand.   

Peter Murphy in his [[Practical Guide to Evidence]] recounts an instructive example.  A frustrated judge in an English (adversarial) court finally asked a barrister after witnesses had produced conflicting accounts, 'Am I never to hear the truth?' 'No, my lord, merely the evidence', replied counsel.   

The name adversary system may be misleading in that it implies it is only within this type of system in which there are opposing prosecution and defense. This is not the case, and both modern adversary and inquisitiorial systems have the powers of the state separated between a prosecutor and the judge and allow the defendant the right to counsel. Indeed, the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] in Article 6 requires these features in the legal systems of its signatory states.   

The right to counsel in criminal trials was initially not accepted in some adversarial systems. It was believed that the facts should speak for themselves, and that lawyers would just blur the matters. As a consequence, it was only in [[1836]] that England allowed suspects of felonies to have legal counsel (the ''Prisoners' Counsel Act''), and it was not until [[1963]] that the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] declared that legal counsel was a fundamental right of felony defendants in state courts.  See ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', {{ussc|372|335|[[1963]]}}.

One of the most significant differences between the adversary system and the inquisitional system occurs when a criminal defendant admits to the crime. In an adversary system, there is no more controversy and the case proceeds to sentencing; though in many jurisdictions the defendant must have [[allocute|allocution]] of her or his crime, a false confession will not be accepted even in common law courts. By contrast, in an inquisitional system, the fact that the defendant has confessed is merely one more fact that is entered into evidence, and a confession by the defendant does not remove the requirement that the prosecution present a full case. This allows for [[plea bargain]]ing in adversary systems in a way that is difficult or impossible in inquisitional system, and many felony cases in the United States are handled without trial through such plea bargains.   

Another difference is in the rules of evidence. Because the adversarial system assumes that the evidence is to be presented to laymen rather than to jurists, the rules of evidence are considerably more strict. Rules on [[hearsay]] are much stricter in most adversarial systems than in inquisitorial systems; though often lower tribunals are allowed some flexibility in applying the strict rules of common law evidence such as in domestic relations courts or in small claims proceedings where the parties are often unrepresented by lawyers and the judge functions as more of an inquisitor to protect the interests of children than a neutral arbiter of justice.   

==History of the adversarial process==   

Some writers trace the adversarial process to the medieval mode of [[trial by combat]], in which some litigants, notably women, were allowed a champion to represent them. Certainly the use of the [[jury]] in the common law system seems to have fostered the adversarial system, and there are many today who believe that it remains the best way of providing for the determination of a disputed issue. On the other hand, the new British Civil Justice reforms initiated by Lord Woolf (the Civil Procedure Rules or CPR) are prefaced with a case management system controlled by the judge rather than by the lawyers representing the different parties; similar case management systems are coming into use in the United States. 

The adversarial system also disposes of the canard whereby lawyers are often asked how they can represent someone if they believe that person to be guilty (or innocent for that matter, although this might be a more difficult position): counsel must not deceive the court but his client is entitled to have the best presentation of the case laid before the tribunal and to have the evidence fully tested.

==Basic features of the adversarial system==   

As an accused is not compelled to give evidence in a [[crime|criminal]] adversarial proceeding, he may not be questioned by prosecutor or judge unless he chooses to do so. However, should he decide to testify, he is subject to [[cross-examination]] and can be found guilty of [[perjury]]. As the election to maintain an accused person's 'right to silence' prevents any examination or cross-examination of that person's position, it follows that the decision of counsel as to what evidence will be called is a crucial tactic in any case in the adversarial system and hence it might be said that it is a lawyer's manipulation of the truth.  Certainly, it requires the skills of counsel on both sides to be fairly equally pitted and subjected to an impartial judge.    

By contrast, while defendants in most civil law systems can be compelled to give a statement, this statement is not subject to cross-examination and not given under oath. This allows the defendant to explain his side of the case without being subject to cross-examination by a skilled opposition.   

The passive role of the judge in the adversarial system also allows for [[plea bargain| plea bargaining]] in which the defendant agrees to plead guilty in exchange for a lesser sentence by the prosecution, or for out of court settlements in civil cases. In practice, most cases in the United States are disposed of in this manner. In the [[inquisitional system]], plea bargaining is impossible because there is no concept of a plea, and any attempt for the prosecution and defense to negotiate a sentence without the involvement of the judge would be considered highly unethical.

In some adversarial legislative systems, the court is permitted to make inferences on an accused's failure to face [[cross-examination]] or to answer a particular question.  This obviously limits the usefulness of silence as a tactic by the defence. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 allowed such inferences to be made for the first time. This change was disparaged by critics as an end to the 'right to silence', though in fact an accused still has the right to remain silent and cannot be compelled to take the stand. In the [[United States]], the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] has been interpreted to prohibit a jury from drawing a negative inference based on the defendant's invocation of his right not to testify, and the jury must be so instructed if the defendant requests.

==Comparisons with the inquisitorial approach==   

In many jurisdictions the approaches of each system are often formal differences in the way cases are reviewed. It is questionable that the results would be different if cases were conducted under the differing approaches; in fact no statistics exist that can show that these systems do not come to the same result. However, these approaches are often a matter of national pride and there are opinions amongst jurists about the merits of the differing approaches and their drawbacks as well.   

Proponents of the adversarial system often argue that the system is more fair and less prone to abuse than the inquisitional approach, because it allows less room for the state to be biased against the defendant. It also allows most private litigants to settle their disputes in an amicable manner through discovery and pre-trial settlements in which non-contested facts are agreed upon and not dealt with during the trial process.   

In addition, adversarial procedure defenders argue that the inquisitorial court systems are overly institutionalized and removed from the average citizen. The common law trial lawyer has ample opportunity to uncover the truth in a laboratory called the courtroom. Most cases that go to trial are carefully prepared through a discovery process that aids in the review of evidence and testimony before it is presented to judge or jury.  The lawyers involved have a very good idea of the scope of agreement and disagreement of the issues to present at trial which develops much in the same way as the role of investigative judges. It has also been argued that a trial by a jury of one's peers may be more impartial than any government paid inquisitor and a panel of his peers. In the United States the right to a trial by a jury of one's peers who are common citizens is guaranteed by the United States Constitution.  

Proponents of inquisitorial justice dispute these points. They point out that most cases in adversarial systems are actually resolved by [[plea bargain]] and [[Settlement (law)|settlement]].  Most legal cases in these systems do not go to trial; this can lead to great injustice when the defendant has an unskilled or overworked attorney, which is likely to be the case when the defendant is poor. In addition, proponents of inquisitorial systems argue that the plea bargain system causes the participants within the system to act in perverse ways, in that it encourages prosecutors to bring charges far in excess of what is warranted and defendants to plead guilty even when they believe that they are not. Furthermore, proponents of inquisitorial systems also argue that the power of the judge is limited by the use of lay assessors and that a panel of judges may not necessarily be more biased than a jury.   

Furthermore, some countries with an [[inquisitorial system]] do use [[jury trial]]s for some categories of [[crime]]. Interestingly, some countries such as [[Japan]] before 1943 which used to have a right to jury trial, rarely used them, as there is a popular belief that any defendant who requests a jury trial has a case that is so weak that they are willing to risk pleading their case before strangers rather than professional judges.  Hence, jurors in those countries are very unsympathetic toward defendants. (Jury system in Japan was suspended in 1943. In 2004, whole new lay-judge system was enacted in Japan and will be installed in 2009. In this system, 6 jurors and 3 judges will discuss and judge a case together.)

==Criticisms of the adversarial system==
Critics of this system suggest that the ability of a party to obtain a favorable result may hinge more upon the quality of their lawyers than on the facts of the case. An uncharismatic lawyer may fail to sway the jury with the plain facts of the case, whereas a highly charismatic lawyer may find favor with the jury by relating a narrative that seems to have little to do with the facts. This perception has been highlighted in popular culture - a classic example being the [[South Park]] episode in which [[Johnnie Cochran]] is portrayed as winning the jury over with his absurd and meaningless [[Chewbacca defense]].

The system is also criticized for the lucrative advantages it appears to present to the lawyer. Although both civil and criminal defendants are generally permitted to represent themselves ''pro se'', the complexity of the legal system means that the civil defendant is often forced to either pay whatever it takes to defend himself, or enter into a settlement with the opposing party. This is typified in [[Danny Devito]]'s famous quote in ''[[Other People's Money]]'' that &quot;lawyers are like nuclear weapons, you have yours, I have mine, and when we use them they %^%$ everything up&quot; applies here.  Contrary to popular belief, however, trial lawyers are not the wealthiest members of the profession - the lawyers who make the most money are often never involved in litigation at all, but rather in the structuring of mergers and similar relationships between corporations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abano Terme''' (town changed its name from ''Abano Bagni'' in [[1930]]) is a town in the province of [[Padua]], in the [[Veneto]] region, [[Italy]], on the eastern slope of the [[Colli Euganei]]; it is 6 miles (10 kilometers) southwest by rail from Padua. Abano Terme's population is 18,232 ([[2001]]) (in [[1901]] it was only 4,556). 

The town's hot springs and mud baths are much resorted to, and were known to the Romans as Aponi fons or Aquae Patavinae. A description of them is given in a letter of [[Theodoric_the_Great|Theodoric]], the king of the [[Ostrogoths]]. Some remains of the ancient baths have been discovered (S. Mandruzzato, ''Trattato dei Bagni d'Abano,'' Padua, 1789).  An oracle of [[Geryon]] lay near, and the so-called ''sortes Praenestinae'' (C.I.L. i., Berlin, 1863; 1438-1454), small bronze cylinders inscribed, and used as oracles, were perhaps found here in the 16th century. 

The waters were hot, sometimes as high as 180 to 187 degrees Fahrenheit. When applied to the surface of the body, either by bathing or by means of the ''mud'' application or process, they were said to be efficacious in the cure of rheumatism, gout, and diseases of the skin.tructures

The spa resorts of Abano Terme have modern hotels and facilities and is one of Europe's most important spas.

'''Abatis''', '''Abattis''' or '''Abbattis''' (a [[French language|French]] word meaning a heap of material thrown), a term in field [[fortification]] for an obstacle formed of the branches of trees laid in a row, with the tops directed towards the enemy and interlaced or tied with [[wire]].  The abatis is used alone or in combination with [[wire entanglement]]s and other obstacles.

Although used since at least [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial]] times, abatis is rarely seen nowadays, having been largely replaced by [[wire obstacle]]s. However it may be used as a supplement when [[barbed wire]] is in short supply. Also, a form of giant abatis, using whole trees instead of branches, can be used as an anti-[[tank]] obstacle.

An important weakness of abatis - in comparison to [[barbed wire]] - is that if time allows, it can be destroyed by [[fire]]. Also if it is laced together with [[rope]] instead of [[wire]], the rope can be very quickly destroyed by fire, after which the abatis can be quickly pulled apart by [[grappling hook]]s thrown from a safe distance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Antoine Thomson d'Abbadie''' ([[January 3]], [[1810]] &amp;ndash; [[March 19]], [[1897]]), was a [[France|French]] [[geographer]], notable for his travels in [[Ethiopia]] during the first half of the [[19th century]]. He was the older brother of [[Arnaud Michel d'Abbadie]].

They were both born in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] of a [[France|French]] father and an Irish mother. The family moved to [[France]] in 1818, and there the brothers received a careful scientific education.

In 1835 the [[French Academy]] sent Antoine on a scientific mission to [[Brazil]], the results being published at a later date (1873) under the title of ''Observations relatives à la physique du globe faites au Bresil et en Ethiopie''. The younger Abbadie spent some time in [[Algeria]] before, in 1837, the two brothers started for Ethiopia, landing at [[Massawa]] in February 1838. They visited various parts of Ethiopia, including the then little-known districts of [[Ennarea]] and [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]], sometimes together and sometimes separately. They met with many difficulties and many adventures, and became involved in political intrigues, Antoine especially exercising such influence as he possessed in favour of France and the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] missionaries. After collecting much valuable information concerning the geography, geology, archaeology and natural history of Ethiopia, the brothers returned to France in 1848 and began to prepare their materials for publication.

The more distinguished brother, Antoine, became involved in various controversies relating both to his geographical results and his political intrigues. He was especially attacked by [[Charles Tilstone Beke]], who impugned his veracity, especially with reference to the journey to [[Kana, Ethiopia|Kana]]. But time and the investigations of subsequent explorers have shown that Abbadie was quite trustworthy as to his facts, though wrong in his contention -- hotly contested by Beke -- that the [[Blue Nile]] was the main stream. The topographical results of his explorations were published in [[Paris]] between 1860 and 1873 in ''Geodesie d'Ethiopie'', full of the most valuable information and illustrated by ten maps. Of the ''Geographie de l'Ethiopie'' (Paris, 1890) only one volume has been published. In ''Un Catalogue raisonné de manuscrits ethiopiens'' (Paris, 1859) is a description of 234 Ethiopian [[manuscript]]s collected by Antoine. He also compiled various vocabularies, including a ''Dictionnaire de la langue amarinna'' (Paris, 1881), and prepared an edition of the ''[[Shepherd of Hermas]]'', with the Latin version, in 1860. He published numerous papers dealing with the geography of Ethiopia, Ethiopian coins and ancient inscriptions. Under the title of ''Reconnaissances magnetiques'' he published in 1890 an account of the [[magnetic]] observations made by him in the course of several journeys to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Levant]]. The general account of the travels of the two brothers was published by Arnaud in 1868 under the title of ''Douze ans dans la Haute Ethiopie''.

Both brothers received the grand medal of the [[Paris Geographical Society]] in 1850. Antoine was a knight of the [[Légion d’honneur|Legion of Honour]] and a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He died in 1897, and bequeathed an estate in the [[Pyrenees]], yielding 40,000 francs a year, to the Academy of Sciences, on condition of its producing within fifty years a catalogue of half-a-million stars. His brother Arnaud died in 1893.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abba Mari''' (in full, '''Abba Mari ben Moses ben Joseph'''), [[France|French]] [[rabbi]], was born at [[Lunel]], near [[Montpellier]], towards the end of the [[13th century]]. He is also known as '''Yarhi''' from his birthplace ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Yerah'', i.e. [[moon]], lune), and he further took the name '''Astruc''', '''Don Astruc''' or '''En Astruc of Lunel'''.

The descendant of men learned in [[rabbinic]] lore, Abba Mari devoted himself to the study of [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], and made himself acquainted with the writings of [[Maimonides|Moses Maimonides]] and [[Nachmanides]] as well as with the ''[[Talmud]]''.

In Montpellier, where he lived from 1303 to 1306, he was much distressed by the prevalence of [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[rationalism]], which in his opinion, through the medium of the works of Maimonides, threatened the authority of the [[Old Testament]], obedience to the law, and the belief in [[miracle]]s and [[revelation]]. He therefore, in a series of letters (afterwards collected under the title ''Minhat Kenaot'', i.e., &quot;Jealousy Offering&quot;) called upon the famous rabbi [[Solomon ben Adret]] of [[Barcelona]] to come to the aid of orthodoxy. Ben Adret, with the approval of other prominent Spanish rabbis, sent a letter to the community at Montpellier proposing to forbid the study of philosophy to those who were less than thirty years of age, and, in spite of keen opposition from the liberal section, a decree in this sense was issued by Ben Adret in 1305.  The result was a great schism among the [[Jew]]s of [[Spain]] and southern [[France]], and a new impulse was given to the study of philosophy by the unauthorized interference of the Spanish rabbis.

On the expulsion of the Jews from France by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] in 1306, Abba Mari settled at [[Perpignan]], where he published the letters connected with the controversy. His subsequent history is unknown.  Beside the letters, he was the author of liturgical poetry and works on civil law.

==Defender of Law and Tradition==

(Graetz and others have, incorrectly, En Duran): Leader of the opposition to the [[rationalism]] of the Maimonists in the Montpellier controversy of 1303-1306; born at Lunel—hence his name, Yarḥi (from Yeraḥ = Moon = Lune). He was a descendant of [[Meshullam ben Jacob]] of Lunel, one of whose five sons was Joseph, the grandfather of Abba Mari, who, like his son Moses, the father of Abba Mari, was highly respected for both his rabbinical learning and his general erudition. Abba Mari moved to Montpellier, where, to his chagrin, he found the study of rabbinical lore greatly neglected by the young, who devoted all of their time and zeal to [[science]] and [[philosophy]]. The rationalistic method pursued by the new school of Maimonists (including [[Levi ben Abraham ben Chayyim]] of [[Villefranche]], near the town of [[Perpignan]], and [[Jacob Anatolio]]) especially provoked his indignation; for the sermons preached and the works published by them seemed to resolve the entire [[Scripture]]s into [[allegory]] and threatened to undermine the Jewish faith and the observance of the Law and tradition. He was not without some philosophical training. He mentions even with reverence the name of Maimonides, whose work he possessed and studied; but he was more inclined toward the mysticism of Nachmanides. Above all, he was a thorough believer in [[revelation]] and in a [[divine providence]], and was a sincere, law-observing follower of rabbinical Judaism. He would not allow Aristotle, &quot;the searcher after God among the heathen,&quot; to be ranked with Moses.

==Opponent of Rationalism==

Abba Mari possessed considerable Talmudic knowledge and some poetical talent; but his zeal for the Law made him an agitator and a persecutor of all the advocates of liberal thought. Being himself without sufficient authority, he appealed in a number of letters, afterward published under the title of ''Minḥat Ḳenaot'' (''Jealousy Offering''), to [[Solomon ben Adret]] of [[Barcelona]], the most influential rabbi of the time, to use his powerful authority to check the source of evil by hurling his [[anathema]] against both the study of philosophy and the allegorical interpretations of the Bible, which did away with all belief in miracles. Ben Adret, while reluctant to interfere in the affairs of other congregations, was in perfect accord with Abba Mari as to the danger of the new rationalistic systems, and advised him to organize the conservative forces in defense of the Law. Abba Mari, through Ben Adret's aid, obtained allies eager to take up his cause, among whom were Don [[Bonafoux Vidal]] of Barcelona and his brother, Don [[Crescas Vidal]], then in Perpignan. The proposition of the latter to prohibit, under penalty of [[excommunication]], the study of philosophy and any of the sciences except [[medicine]], by one under thirty years of age, met with the approval of Ben Adret. Accordingly, Ben Adret addressed to the congregation of Montpellier a letter, signed by fifteen other rabbis, proposing to issue a decree pronouncing the anathema against all those who should pursue the study of philosophy and science before due maturity in age and in rabbinical knowledge. On a Sabbath in September, 1304, the letter was to be read before the congregation, when [[Jacob Machir Don Profiat Tibbon]], the renowned astronomical and mathematical writer, entered his protest against such unlawful interference by the Barcelona rabbis, and a [[schism]] ensued. Twenty-eight members signed Abba Mari's letter of approval; the others, under Tibbon's leadership, addressed another letter to Ben Adret, rebuking him and his colleagues for condemning a whole community without knowledge of the local conditions. Finally, the agitation for and against the liberal ideas brought about a schism in the entire Jewish population in southern [[France]] and [[Spain]].

Encouraged, however, by letters signed by the rabbis of [[Argentière]] and Lunel, and particularly by the support of [[Kalonymus ben Todros]], the ''[[nasi]]'' of [[Narbonne]], and of the eminent Talmudist [[Asheri of Toledo]], Ben Adret issued a decree, signed by thirty-three rabbis of Barcelona, excommunicating those who should, within the next fifty years, study [[physics]] or [[metaphysics]] before their thirtieth year of age (basing his action on the principle laid down by Maimonides, ''Moreh,'' i. 34), and had the order promulgated in the synagogue on Sabbath, [[July 26]], [[1305]]. When this [[heresy]]-decree, to be made effective, was forwarded to other congregations for approval, the friends of liberal thought, under the leadership of the Tibbonites, issued a counter-ban, and the conflict threatened to assume a serious character, as blind party zeal (this time on the liberal side) did not shrink from asking the civil powers to intervene. But an unlooked-for calamity brought the warfare to an end. The expulsion of the Jews from France by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] (&quot;the Fair&quot;), in 1306, caused the Jews of Montpellier to take refuge, partly in [[Provence]], partly in Perpignan and partly in [[Majorca]]. Consequently, Abba Mari removed first to [[Arles]], and, within the same year, to Perpignan, where he finally settled and disappeared from public view. There he published his correspondence with Ben Adret and his colleagues.

==His Works==

Abba Mari collected the correspondence and added to each letter a few explanatory notes. Of this collection, called ''Minḥat Ḳenaot,'' there are several manuscript copies extant; namely, at [[Oxford]] (Neubauer, ''Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS.,'' Nos. 2182 and 2221); [[Paris]], Bibl. Nat. No. 976; Günzburg Libr., [[St. Petersburg]]; [[Parma]]; [[Ramsgate]] [[Montefiore College]] Library (formerly Halberstam, No. 192); and [[Turin]]. Some of these (Oxford, No. 2221, and Paris, Bibl. Nat.) are mere fragments. The printed edition (Presburg, 1838), prepared by M. L. Bislichis, contains: (1) Preface; (2) a treatise of eighteen chapters on the [[incorporeality]] of [[God]]; (3) correspondence; (4) a treatise, called ''Sefer ha-Yarḥi,'' included also in letter 58; (5) a defense of ''The Guide'' and its author by [[Shem-Tob Palquera]] (Grätz, ''Gesch. d. Juden,'' vii. 173). As the three cardinal doctrines of Judaism, Abba Mari accentuates: (1) That of the recognition of God's existence and of His absolute sovereignty, eternity, unity, and incorporeality, as taught in revelation, especially in the ''[[Decalogue]]''; (2) that of the world's creation by Him out of nothing, as evidenced particularly by the Sabbath; (3) that of the special [[Divine providence|providence]] of God, as manifested in the Biblical [[miracle]]s. In the preface, Abba Mari explains his object in collecting the correspondence; and in the treatise which follows he shows that the study of philosophy, useful in itself as a help toward the acquisition of the knowledge of God, requires great caution, lest we be misled by the Aristotelian philosophy or its false interpretation, as regards the principles of creatiom ''[[ex nihilo]]'' and divine individual providence. The manuscripts include twelve letters which are not included in the printed edition of ''Minḥat Ḳenaot.''

==Contents of the Minḥat Ḳenaot==

The correspondence refers mainly to the proposed restriction of the study of the Aristotelian philosophy. Casually, other theological questions are discussed. For example, letters 1, 5, and 8 contain a discussion on the question, whether the use of a piece of metal with the figure of a lion, as a [[talisman]], is permitted by Jewish law for medicinal purposes, or is prohibited as [[idolatry|idolatrous]]. In letter 131, Abba Mari mourns the death of Ben Adret, and in letter 132 he sends words of sympathy to the congregation of Perpignan, on the death of Don [[Solomon Vidal]] and Rabbi Meshullam. Letter 33 contains the statement of Abba Mari that two letters which he desired to insert could not be discovered by him. MS. Ramsgate, No. 52, has the same statement, but also the two letters missing in the printed copies. In the ''Sefer ha-Yarḥi'', Abba Mari refers to the great caution shown by the rabbis of old as regards the teaching of the mysteries of philosophy, and recommended by men like the [[Hai Gaon]], Maimonides, and [[David Kimhi]]. A responsum of Abba Mari on a ritual question is contained in MS. Ramsgate, No. 136; and Zunz (''Literaturgeschichte der Synagogalen Poesie,'' p. 498), mentions a ''ḳinah'' composed by Abba Mari.

The ''Minḥat Ḳenaot'' is instructive reading for the historian because it throws much light upon the deeper problems which agitated Judaism, the question of the relation of religion to the philosophy of the age, which neither the zeal of the fanatic nor the bold attitude of the liberal-minded could solve in any fixed dogmatic form or by any anathema, as the independent spirit of the congregations refused to accord to the rabbis the power possessed by the [[Church]] of dictating to the people what they should believe or respect. At the close of the work are added several eulogies written by Abba Mari on Ben Adret (who died in 1310), and on Don Vidal, [[Solomon of Perpignan]], and Don [[Bonet Crescas]] of Lunel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Abbas Helmi.jpg|right]]'''Abbas Hilmi Pasha''' or '''Abbas II''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: عباس حلمي باشا) ([[July 14]], [[1874]] &amp;ndash; [[1944]]) was the last ''[[khedive]]'' of [[Egypt]] ([[January 8]], [[1892]] &amp;ndash; [[1914]]).

Abbas Hilmi Pasha was the great-great-grandson of [[Mehemet Ali (Egypt)|Mehmet Ali]]. He succeeded his father, [[Tewfik Pasha]], as ''khedive'' of Egypt. When a boy he visited [[England]], and he had an English tutor for some time in [[Cairo]]. He then went to school in [[Lausanne]], and from there passed on to the [[Theresianum]] in [[Vienna]]. In addition to [[Turkish language|Turkish]], his [[mother tongue]], he acquired fluency in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and a good conversational knowledge of [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]].

He was still at college in Vienna when the sudden death of his father raised him to the ''Khedivate''; and he was barely of age according to [[Turkey|Turkish]] law, which fixes majority at eighteen in cases of succession to the throne. For some time he did not cooperate very cordially with [[Great Britain]]. He was young and eager to exercise his new power. His throne and life had not been saved for him by the British, as was the case with his father. He was surrounded by intriguers who were playing a game of their own, and for some time he appeared almost disposed to be as reactionary as his great-uncle [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]].

But in process of time he learnt to understand the importance of [[United Kingdom|British]] counsels. He paid a second visit to England in 1900, during which he frankly acknowledged the great good the British had done in Egypt, and declared himself ready to follow their advice and to cooperate with the British officials administering Egyptian affairs. The establishment of a sound system of native justice, the great remission of taxation, the reconquest of the [[Sudan]], the inauguration of the substantial irrigation works at [[Aswan]], and the increase of cheap, sound education, each received his approval and all the assistance he could give. He displayed more interest in [[agriculture]] than in statecraft, and his farm of cattle and horses at [[Koubah]], near Cairo, would have done credit to any agricultural show in England; at [[Montaza]], near [[Alexandria]], he created a similar establishment. He married the Princess [[Ikbal Hanem]] and had several children. [[Prince Muhammad Abdul Moneim|Muhammad Abdul Moneim]], the heir-apparent, was born on [[February 20]], [[1899]].

When the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], Britain declared Egypt a British [[protectorate]] and deposed Abbas. He retired to [[Switzerland]], where he died.

'''Abbas Mirza ''' (&amp;#1593;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1587; &amp;#1605;&amp;#1740;&amp;#1585;&amp;#1586;&amp;#1575; in [[Persian language|Persian]]) &amp;lrm;([[August 26]], [[1789]]-[[October 25]], [[1833]]), was a [[crown prince]] of [[Iran|Persia]], known because of his wars with [[Russia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], and his death before his father, the [[shah]]. Abbas was an intelligent prince, possessed some literary taste, and is noteworthy on account of the comparative simplicity of his life.

He was a younger son of [[Fath Ali Shah]], but on account of his mother's royal birth was destined by his father to succeed him. Entrusted with the government of a part of Persia, he sought to rule it in European fashion, and employed officers to reorganize his army. He was soon at war with Russia, and his aid was eagerly solicited by both [[England]] and [[Napoleon]], anxious to checkmate one another in the East. Preferring the friendship of [[France]], Abbas Mirza continued the war against Russia's [[General Kotlyarevsky]], but his new ally could give him very little assistance, and in October, [[1813]], Persia was compelled to make a disadvantageous peace, ceding some territory in the [[Caucasus]] (present-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dagestan]], and most of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]).

He gained some successes during a war between the Ottoman Empire and Persia which broke out in [[1821]], but a peace treaty was signed in [[1823]] at [[Erzurum]], after failed attacks from both sides. His second war with Russia, which began in [[1826]], succeeded as little as the first one, and Persia was forced to cede nearly all of its [[Armenia]]n territories and [[Nakhchivan]]. When peace was made in February, [[1828]], Abbas Mirza then sought to restore order in the province of [[Khorasan]], which was nominally under Persian supremacy, and while engaged in the task died at [[Meshed]] in [[1833]]. In [[1834]] his eldest son, [[Mohammed Mirza]], succeeded Fath Ali as shah.

He is most remembered for his valor in battle and his attempts to modernize the Persian army, unsuccessful due to the lack of government centralization in Iran during the era.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:abp-g-abbot.jpg|frame|Archbishop George Abbot by an unknown artist, in the collection of Balliol College.]]

'''George Abbot''' ([[October 19]], [[1562]] &amp;ndash; [[August 5]], [[1633]]) was an [[England|English]] divine, [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], born at [[Guildford]] in Surrey, where his father was a cloth-worker.  He studied, and then taught, at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], was chosen Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]] in [[1597]], and appointed [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[Winchester Cathedral|Winchester]] in [[1600]].  He was three times [[Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of Oxford|university]], and took a leading part in preparing the authorized version of the [[New Testament]].

In [[1608]] he went to [[Scotland]] with [[George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar]] to arrange for a union between the churches of [[England]] and Scotland.  He so pleased [[James I of England|King James]] in this affair that he was made [[Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry]] in [[1609]], was translated to the See of [[Bishop of London|London]] a month afterwards, and in less than a year was raised to that of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]].  His [[puritan]] instincts frequently led him not only into harsh treatment of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]s, but also into courageous resistance to the royal will, e.g. when he opposed the scandalous divorce suit of the Lady Frances Howard against the [[Earl of Essex]], and again in 1618 when, at [[Croydon]], he forbade the reading of the declaration permitting [[Sunday sports]].  He was naturally, therefore, a promoter of the match between the [[elector palatine]] and the Princess Elizabeth, and a firm opponent of the projected marriage of the Prince of [[Wales]] with the Infanta of Spain.  This policy brought upon him the hatred of [[William Laud]] (with whom he had previously come into collision at Oxford) and the court, though the King himself never forsook him.

In [[1622]], while hunting in [[Lord Zouch]]'s park at [[Bramshill]] in [[Hampshire]], a bolt from his cross-bow aimed at a deer happened to strike one of the keepers, who died within an hour, and Abbot was so greatly distressed by the event that he fell into a state of settled [[melancholia]].  His enemies maintained that the fatal issue of this accident disqualified him for his office, and argued that, though the homicide was involuntary, the sport of [[hunting]] which had led to it was one in which no clerical person could lawfully indulge.  The King had to refer the matter to a commission of ten, though he said that &quot;an angel might have miscarried after this sort.&quot; The commission was equally divided, and the King gave a casting vote in the Archbishop's favour, though signing also a formal pardon or dispensation.

After this the Archbishop seldom appeared at the Council, chiefly on account of his infirmities. He attended the King constantly, however, in his last illness, and performed the ceremony of the coronation of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. His refusal to license the [[assize sermon]] preached by Dr [[Robert Sibthorp]] at Northampton on [[February 22]] 1627, in which cheerful obedience was urged to the king's demand for a general loan, and the duty proclaimed of absolute non-resistance even to the most arbitrary royal commands, led Charles to deprive him of his functions as Primate, putting them in commission. The need of summoning parliament, however, soon brought about a nominal restoration of the Archbishop's powers.  His presence being unwelcome at court, he lived from that time in retirement, leaving Laud and his party in undisputed ascendancy.  He died at Croydon on the [[August 5]] 1633, and was buried at Guildford, his native place, where he had endowed a hospital with lands to the value of £300 a year.

Abbot was a conscientious prelate, though narrow in view and often harsh towards both separatists and Roman Catholics.  He wrote a large number of works, the most interesting being his discursive ''Exposition on the Prophet Jonah'' (1600), which was reprinted in 1845.  His ''Geography, or a Brief Description of the Whole World'' (1599), passed through numerous editions. 

The best account of him is in [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner|S. R.  Gardiner]]'s ''History of England''.

Guildford remembers the Archbishop with a statue in the High Street, a pub and also a secondary school([[George Abbot School]] named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Adware''' or '''advertising-supported software''' is any [[Computer software|software]] package which automatically plays, displays, or downloads advertising material to a computer after the software is installed on it or while the application is being used.

== Application ==
Adware is software integrated into or bundled with a program. It is usually seen by the [[programmer]] as a way to recover programming development costs, and in some cases it may allow the program to be provided to the user free of charge or at a reduced price. The advertising income may allow or motivate the programmer to continue to write, maintain and upgrade the software product.

Some adware is also [[shareware]], and so the word may be used as term of distinction to differentiate between types of shareware software.  What differentiates adware from other shareware is that it is primarily advertising-supported. Users may also be given the option to pay for a &quot;registered&quot; or &quot;licensed&quot; copy to do away with the advertisements.

== Controversy ==
There are concerns about adware because it often takes the form of [[spyware]], in which information about the user's activity is tracked, reported, and often re-sold, often without the knowledge or consent of the user.  Of even greater concern is [[malware]], which may interfere with the function of other software applications, in order to force users to visit a particular web site.

It is not uncommon for people to confuse &quot;adware&quot; with &quot;spyware&quot; and &quot;malware&quot;, especially since these concepts overlap.  For example, if one user installs &quot;adware&quot; on a computer, and consents to a tracking feature, the &quot;adware&quot; becomes &quot;spyware&quot; when another user visits that computer, and interacts with and is tracked by the &quot;adware&quot; without their consent.

Spyware has prompted an outcry from [[computer security]] and [[privacy]] advocates, including the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] [http://www.epic.org]. Often, spyware applications send the user's browsing habits to an adserving company, which then targets adverts at the user based on their interests. [[Kazaa]] and [[eXeem]] are popular programs which incorporate software of this type.

Adware programs other than spyware do not invisibly collect and upload this activity record 
or personal information when the user of the computer has not expected
or approved of the transfer, but some vendors of adware maintain that their application which
does this is not also spyware, due to disclosure of program activities: for example, a 
product vendor may indicate that since somewhere in the product's [[Terms of Use]] there is a clause 
that third-party software will be included that may collect and may report on computer use, that 
this Terms of Use disclosure means the product is just adware.

A number of software applications are available to help computer users search for and modify adware programs to block the presentation of advertisements and to remove spyware modules. To avoid a backlash, as with the advertising industry in general, creators of adware must balance their attempts to generate revenue with users' desire to be left alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Greek mythology]], '''Aeacus''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: '''Aiakos''', &quot;bewailing&quot; or &quot;earth borne&quot;) was king in the island of [[Aegina]] in the [[Saronic Gulf]]. He was far-famed for the righteous sense of piety and justice with which he ruled over his people and his judgment was sought all over Hellas, so much so that, after his death, he was appointed one of the judges of the shades in [[Erebus]], with Cretan [[Minos]] and [[Rhadamanthus]]. Rhadamanthus judged the souls of easterners, Aeacus judged [[Hellenes]] and Minos had the deciding vote, a later elaboration of the myth tells. 

Aeacus was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]], daughter of the river-god [[Asopus]].  Thus in his birthright he linked the Olympians with the immemorial [[chthonic]] water spirits of the land. His mother was carried off by Zeus to the island of [[Oenone]], which was afterwards called by her name.

When Aeacus' kingdom had a horrific plague, he prayed to his father Zeus for help.  The king of the gods changed the local ants into people ([[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' vii. 520), who were called [[Myrmidones]]. Aeacus was the ancestor of the [[Aeacidae]].

By his wife [[Endeis]] he was the father of [[Telamon]] and [[Peleus]] (the father of [[Achilles]]).  By [[Psamathe]], he fathered [[Phocus]].

His successful prayer to Zeus for rain at a time of drought (Isocrates, Evagoras, 14) was commemorated by a temple at Aegina ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] ii. 29). He himself erected a temple to [[Zeus]] and helped [[Poseidon]] and [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] to build the walls of [[Troy]].

No other of the archaic priest-kings who ruled Aegina are remembered by the mythographers, for the grandsons of Aeacus, Phocus' sons Panopeus and Crisus left Aegina to settle in [[Phocis]], a region bordering the Gulf of Corinth west of Boeotia.

[[Alexander the Great]] traced his ancestry (through his mother) to Aeacus.

In [[Masami Kurumada]]'s anime [[Saint Seiya]], Aeacus is one of the three Generals of the Underworld, and wears the surplice of Garuda, Celestial Superior Star.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aeclanum''' was an ancient town of [[Samnium]], [[Italy]], 15 m.  E.S.E. of [[Beneventum]], on the [[Via Appia]] (near the modern [[Mirabella Eclano]]).

It became the chief town of the [[Hirpini]] after [[Benevento|Beneventum]] had become a [[Rome|Roman]] [[colony]].

[[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] captured it in [[89 BC]] by setting on fire the wooden breastwork by which it was defended, and new fortifications were erected.

[[Hadrian]], who repaired the Via Appia from Beneventum to this point, made it a colony; it has ruins of the city walls, of an [[aqueduct (Roman)|aqueduct]], baths and an [[amphitheatre]]; nearly 400 inscriptions have also been discovered.

Two different routes to [[Apulia]] diverged at this point, one (Via Aurelia Aeclanensis) leading through the modern [[Ariano]] to [[Herdoniae]], the other (the Via Appia of the Empire) passing the [[Lacus Ampsanctus]] and going on to [[Aquilonia]] and [[Venusia]]; while the road from Aeclanum to [[Abellinum]] (mod.  [[Avellino]]) may also follow an ancient line.

H. Nissen (''Italische Landeskunde,'' [[Berlin]], [[1902]], ii. 819) speaks of another road, which he believes to have been that followed by [[Horace]], from Aeclanum to [[Trevicum]] and thence to [[Ausculum]]; but Th. [[Mommsen]] (''Corpus Inscrip. Lat.,'' Berlin, [[1883]], ix. 602) is more likely to be right in supposing that the road taken by Horace ran directly from Beneventum to Trevicum and thence to Aquilonia (though the course of this road is not yet determined in detail), and that the easier, though somewhat longer, road by Aeclanum was of later date.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Roman religion]], an '''aedicula''' (pl. ''aediculae'') is a small [[shrine]]. The word ''aedicula'' is the [[diminutive]] of the [[Latin]] ''aedis'' or ''[[aedes (Roman)|aedes]]'', a temple or house; thus, an aedicula is literally a small house or [[temple]].

Many aediculae were household [[shrine]]s that held small [[altar]]s or [[statue]]s of the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]]. The Lares were [[Roman religion|Roman deities]] protecting the house and the family household gods. The Penates were originally patron gods (really [[genius (mythology)|genii]]) of the storeroom, later becoming household gods guarding the entire house.
[[image:Ephesus_library-650px.jpg|thumb|250px|[[front]] of [[Celsus]]-Library with Aediculae]]
Other aediculae were small shrines within larger [[temple]]s, usually set on a base, surmounted by a pediment and surrounded by columns. In the Roman architecture the aedicula has except this a representiv funcion in the society. They're applied at public buildings like the [[Triumphal arch]] or [[City gate]] or [[Therm]]es. The [[Celsus]]-Library in [[Ephesus]] (2. c. AD) is their a good example.

In the [[Greek religion]] is a similar small shrine the [[Naiskos]]. But it's determineted exclusively religious.

In the [[Cemeteries]] as a part of the funeral architecture the aedicula exists today yet. The aedicula is to meet in  public buildings like  the Entrance to the subway.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Map Gaul.gif|thumb|A map of [[Gaul]] showing the relative position of the [[Aedui]] tribe.]]

'''Aedui''', Haedui  or Hedui (Gr. ''Aidouoi''), are [[Gallic]] people of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]], who inhabited the country between the Arar ([[Saone]]) and Liger ([[Loire]]), in today's [[France]].

The statement in [[Strabo]] (ii. 3. 192) that they dwelt between the Arar and Dubis ([[Doubs]]) is incorrect.  Their territory thus included the greater part of the modern departments of [[Saône-et-Loire]], [[Côte-d'Or]] and [[Nièvre]].  According to [[Livy]] (v. 34), they took part in the expedition of [[Bellovesus]] into [[Italy]] in the [[6th century BC]].

Before [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s time they had attached themselves to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and were honoured with the title of brothers and kinsmen of the Roman people.  When the [[Sequani]], their neighbours on the other side of the [[Arar]], with whom they were continually quarrelling, invaded their country and subjugated them with the assistance of a [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] chieftain named [[Ariovistus]], the Aedui sent [[Divitiacus]], the [[Druidry|druid]], to [[Rome]] to appeal to the [[Roman Senate|senate]] for help, but his mission was unsuccessful.

On his arrival in [[Gaul]] ([[58 BC]]), Caesar restored their independence.  In spite of this, the Aedui joined the Gallic coalition against Caesar (''B. G.'' vii. 42), but after the surrender of [[Vercingetorix]] at [[Alesia]] were glad to return to their allegiance.  [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] dismantled their native capital [[Bibracte]] on [[Mont Beuvray]], and substituted a new town with a half-Roman, half-Gaulish name, Augustodunum (modern [[Autun]]).

In [[21]], during the reign of [[Tiberius]], they revolted under [[Julius Sacrovir]], and seized [[Augustudunum]], but were soon put down by Gaius Silius ([[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann.]]'' iii. 43-46).  The Aedui were the first of the Gauls to receive from the emperor [[Claudius]] the distinction of ''[[jus honorum]]''.  The oration of [[Eumenius]], in which he pleaded for the restoration of the schools of his native place Augustodunum, shows that the district was neglected.  The chief magistrate of the Aedui in Caesar's time was called [[Vergobretus]] (according to [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], &quot;judgment-worker&quot;), who was elected annually, possessed powers of life and death, but was forbidden to go beyond the frontier. Certain clientes, or small communities, were also dependent upon the Aedui.

The '''Aegadian Islands ''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Isole Egadi''; [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Aegates Insulae''), are a group of small mountainous islands in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] off the northwest coast of [[Sicily]], [[Italy]], near the city of [[Trapani]], with a total area of 37,45 km².  

[[Favignana]] (''Aegusa''), the largest, lies 10 miles south west of [[Trapani]]; [[Levanzo]] (''Phorbantia'') 8 miles west; while [[Marettimo]], the ancient ''Iera Nesos'', 15 miles west of Trapani, is now reckoned as a part of the group. There are also some minor islands between Favignana and Sicily.  

The overall population in 1987 was estimated at about 5,000. The main occupation of the islanders is fishing and this is where the largest [[tuna]] fishery in Sicily can be found.

There is evidence of [[Neolithic]] and even [[Paleolithic]] paintings in caves on Favigana and on Levanzo.

They are the scene of the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands|defeat]] of the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] fleet by [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus|C. Lutatius Catulus]] in [[241 BC]], which ended the [[First Punic War]].

They belonged to the Pallavicini family of [[Genoa]] until [[1874]], when they were bought by [[Florio]] family of [[Palermo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{History of Greece}}
'''Aegean civilization''' is the general term for the prehistoric [[civilization]]s in [[Greece]] and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. It was formerly called &quot;Mycenaean&quot; because its existence was first brought to popular notice by [[Heinrich Schliemann]]'s excavations at [[Mycenae]] starting in [[1876]]. However, subsequent discoveries have made it clear that Mycenae was not the chief center of Aegean civilization in its earlier stages (or perhaps at any period), and accordingly it is more usual now to use the more general geographical title. 

==Distinctive features==
The uniqueness of Aegean civilization has never been in doubt, since its remains came to be studied seriously.
For a time the surviving remains were thought to have originated with Egyptians or Phoenicians, but with more remains uncovered this was shown to be untrue. The Aegean civilization developed three distinctive features. 

===Art===
Aegean Art is distinguishable from those of other early periods and areas.  Its borrowings from other contemporary arts are clear, especially in its later stages, but received an essential modification at the hands of the Aegean craftsman, and the product is stamped with a new character, namely [[realism (arts)|realism]] and is a precursor of Hellenic art. The fresco-paintings, ceramic motifs, reliefs, free sculpture and toreutic handiwork of [[Crete]] have supplied the clearest proof of it, confirming the impression already created by the goldsmiths' and painters' work of the Greek mainland ([[Mycenae]], [[Vaphio]], [[Tiryns]]).

===Architecture===
The arrangement of Aegean palaces is of two main types. 

First (and perhaps earliest in time), the chambers are grouped around a central court, being linked one with the other in a labyrinthine complexity, and the greater oblongs are entered from a long side and divided longitudinally by pillars. 

Second, the main chamber is of what is known as the [[megaron]] type, i.e. it stands free, isolated from the rest of the plan by corridors, is entered from a vestibule on a short side, and has a central hearth, surrounded by pillars and perhaps open to the sky; there is no central court, and other apartments form distinct blocks.  For possible geographical reasons for this duality of type see [[Crete]]. In spite of many comparisons made with [[Ancient Egyptian|Egyptian]], [[Babylonian]] and [[Hittites|Hittite]] plans, both these arrangements remain out of keeping with any remains of earlier or contemporary structures elsewhere.  

A type of tomb, the dome or &quot;bee-hive,&quot; of which the grandest examples known are at Mycenae. The Cretan 'larnax' coffins, also, have no parallels outside the Aegean.

==History of Aegean Civilization==
In the absence of written records, only a summary history can be derived from monuments and archaeological remains. But the decipherment of writings in recent times has added much new knowledge.

===Origin and continuity===
A great deal of evidence has been uncovered by archaeology which answers the question how much the Aegean civilization, which existed for at least three thousand years, can be regarded as continuous. Aegean civilization had its roots in a long-lasting primitive [[Neolithic]] period.  This period is represented by a [[stratum]], at [[Knossos]] in places nearly 20 ft (6 m) thick, which contains stone implements and shards of handmade and hand-polished vessels, showing a progressive development in technique from bottom to top.

This [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] stratum is seemingly earlier than the lowest layer at [[Hissarlik]]. It closes with the introduction of incised, white-filled decoration on pottery, whose motifs are found reproduced in [[monochrome]] [[pigment]]. Following the end of this period was the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]], and the first of the Minoan periods (see [[Crete]]). Thereafter, by exact observation of [[stratification]], eight more periods have been distinguished, each marked by some important development in pottery. These periods fill the whole Bronze Age, with whose close, by the introduction of the superior metal, iron, the Aegean Age is conventionally held to end.

[[Iron]] came into general Aegean use about 1000 B.C., and possibly was the means by which a body of northern invaders established their power on the ruins of the earlier dominion. Throughout the nine Knossian periods, following the Neolithic period, there is evidence of a perfectly orderly and continuous evolution in, at any rate, ceramic art. From one stage to another, fabrics, forms and motifs of decoration develop gradually; so that, at the close of a span of more than two thousand years, at the least, the influences of the beginning can still be clearly seen and no trace of violent change can be detected. This fact would go far to prove that the civilization continued fundamentally and essentially the same throughout.

It is supported by less abundant remains of other arts. That of painting in fresco, for instance, shows the same orderly development for the later part of the period. In religion, it can at least be said that there is no trace of sharp change; beginning with a uniform [[nature worship]] passing through all the normal stages down to the [[anthropomorphism]] in the latest period.  There is no appearance of intrusive [[deities]] or [[cult]]-ideas.

The Aegean civilization was indigenous, firmly rooted and strong enough to persist essentially unchanged and dominant in its own geographical area throughout the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]]s.

There is slight evidence of such changes as might be due to the intrusion of small conquering tribes, which adopted the superior civilization of the conquered people and became assimilated by them. The various rebuildings of the palace at [[Knossos]] give credence to this. A similar rebuilding took place at the same period at [[Phaestus]], and possibly at [[Hagia Triada]].  

The [[megaron]] arrangement, which we find in the palaces discovered in the north of the Aegean area, at [[Mycenae]], [[Tiryns]] and [[Hissarlik]], indicate they were from a later date, for none of them display the designs so characteristic of Crete.

===Chronology===
The Chronology was originally based on linking archaeological remains with known Egyptian remains which can be dated to Dynasties.

The first was inferred from a similarity between early Minoan vases and others found in Egypt and dated to the 1st Dynasty [[4000BC]].

Other remains found at [[Knossos]] are similar to the 12th Dynasty c[[2500BC]] Egyptian remains.

A [[diorite]] statuette, referable by its style and inscription to the 13th Dynasty, was discovered in deposit  in the Central Court,of [[Knossos]] and a [[cartouche]] of the &quot;Shepherd King,&quot; [[Khyan]], was also found there. He is usually dated about 1900 B.C.

Discoveries of [[scarab]]s and other Egyptian objects made at [[Mycenae]], [[Ialysus]], [[Vaphio]], and others. with the 18th Dynasty (ca. 1600-1400 BC). While in Egypt itself, Refti tributaries, bearing vases of Aegean form, and themselves similar in fashion of dress and arrangement of hair to figures on Cretan [[fresco]]es and gems, are depicted under this and the succeeding Dynasties (e.g. Rekhmara tomb at Thebes).

Actual vases of late Minoan style have been found with remains of the 18th Dynasty, while in the Aegean area itself was evidence of a great wave of Egyptian influence beginning with this same Dynasty, such as the [[Nilotic]] scenes depicted on the [[Mycenae]] daggers, on [[fresco]] and other artefacts.

The end of Aegean civilisation is less certain -- iron does not begin to be used for weapons in the Aegean until about [[1000 BC]], perhaps coinciding with the incursion of northern tribes remembered by the classical Greeks as the [[Dorian Invasion]]. This incursion did not altogether stamp out Aegean civilization, at least in the southern part of its area. But it finally destroyed the palace at [[Knossos]] and initiated the [[Geometric Age]], with which the history of Aegean civilization proper can be said to have closed.

===Annals===
From anthropological data based on skull shapes, a people, similar to the Mediterranean race of North Africa, was settled in the Aegean area from a remote Neolithic antiquity, but, except in Crete, where insular security was combined with great natural fertility, remained in an undeveloped state until far into the [[4th millennium BC|4th millennium B.C.]].

In Crete, however, it had long been developing a certain civilization, and at a period more or less contemporary with Egyptian Dynasties 11 and 12. (2500 B.C.?) the scattered communities of the center of the island coalesced into a strong monarchical state, the [[Minoan civilization]], whose capital was at [[Knossos]]. There the king, probably also high priest of the prevailing nature-cult, built a great stone palace, and received the tribute of lesser communities, likely of whom the prince of [[Phaestus]], who commanded the [[Messara]] plain, was chief. The Minoan monarch had maritime relations with Egypt, and presently sent his wares all over the south Aegean (e.g. to [[Melos]] in the earlier Second City Period of [[Phylakope]]) and to [[Cyprus]], receiving in return such commodities as Melian [[obsidian]] knives. A system of [[pictographic writing]] came into use early in this Minoan period, but only a few documents made of durable material have survived.  Pictorial art of a purely indigenous character, whether on ceramic material or plaster, made great strides, and from ceramic forms we may infer also a high skill in [[metallurgy]].

The absence of fortifications both at Knossos and Phaestus suggest that at this time Crete was internally peaceful and externally secure. Small settlements, in very close relation with the capital, were founded in the east of the island to command fertile districts and assist maritime commerce.  [[Gournia]] and [[Palaikastro]] fulfilled both these ends: [[Zakros]] must have had mainly a commercial purpose, as the starting-point for the African coast. The peak of this dominion was reached about the end of the [[3rd millennium BC|3rd millennium B.C.]], and thereafter there ensued a certain, though not very serious, decline.

Meanwhile, at other favourable spots in the Aegean, but chiefly on sites in easy relation to maritime commerce, e.g. [[Tiryns]] and [[Hissarlik]], other communities of the early race began to arrive at civilization, but were naturally influenced by the more advanced culture of Crete in proportion to their nearness or vicinity. Early [[Hissarlik]] shows less Cretan influence and more external (i.e. Asiatic) than early [[Melos]]. The inner Greek mainland remained still in a backward state.

Five hundred years later -- about 1600 B.C. -- certain striking changes have taken place. The Aegean remains have become astonishingly uniform over the whole area; the local ceramic developments have almost ceased and been replaced by ware of one general type both of fabric and decoration. The Cretans have avoided their previous decadence and are once more possessors of a progressive civilization. They have developed a more convenient and expressive written language by stages, which is best represented by the tablets of [[Hagia Triada]]. The art of the entire area gives evidence of one spirit and common models. In religious representations it shows the same anthropomorphic personification and the same ritual furniture. Objects produced in one locality are found in others. The area of Aegean influence has widened and become more busy. Commerce with Egypt, for example, has increased in a marked degree, and Aegean objects or imitations of them are found to have begun to penetrate into [[Syria]], inland [[Asia Minor]], and the central and western Mediterranean lands, e.g. [[Sicily]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Spain]]. There can be little doubt that a strong power was now fixed in one Aegean center, and that all the area had come under its political, social and artistic influence.

The seat of power was in Crete, but envigorated by an influx of new blood from the north, large enough to instil fresh vigour, but too small to change the civilization in its essential character.

This Cretan dominance was short-lived. The security of the island was apparently violated not long after 1500 BC, when the palace at Knossos was sacked and burned, and Cretan art suffered an irreparable blow, due to the invasion of all the Aegean lands (or at least the Greek mainland and isles) by some less civilized conquerors, who remained politically dominant, but, like their forerunners, having no culture of their own, adopted, while they spoiled, that which they found. Who these invaders were we cannot say, but the probability is that they too came from the north and were precursors of the later &quot;Hellenes.&quot; Under their rule peace was re-established, and art production, though of inferior quality, became abundant again among the subject population. The northern part of the palace at Knossos was re-occupied by chieftains who have left numerous rich graves, and general commercial activity must have been resumed because the uniformity of the decadent Aegean products and their wide distribution become more marked than ever.

About [[1000 BC]] a final catastrophe took place. The palace at [[Knossos]] was once more destroyed, never to be rebuilt or re-inhabited. Iron took the place of bronze, and Aegean art ceased on the Greek mainland and in the Aegean isles, including Crete, together with Aegean writing. In Cyprus and perhaps on the south-west [[Anatolia]]n coasts, there is some reason to think that the cataclysm was less complete, and Aegean art continued to languish, cut off from its fountain-head. Such artistic faculty that survived elsewhere was made in the lifeless geometric style that is reminiscent of the later Aegean, but wholly unworthy of it. Also, [[cremation]] took the place of burial of the dead.

This great disaster, which cleared the ground for a new growth of local art, was probably due to yet another incursion of northern tribes, more barbarous than their predecessors, but possessed of superior iron weapons -- those tribes which later Greek tradition and Homer knew as the [[Dorian]]s. They crushed a civilization already hard hit, and it took two or three centuries for the Aegean artistic spirit, probably preserved in suspended animation by the survival of Aegean racial elements, to blossom anew. On this conquest seems to have ensued a long period of unrest and popular movements, known to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] tradition as the [[Ionian Migration]] and the Aeolic and Dorian &quot;colonizations&quot;. When once more we see the Aegean area clearly, it is dominated by the Hellenes, though it has not lost all memory of its earlier culture.

==Political Organization==
Evidence of monarchy at all periods on Crete can be found by the great [[Crete|Cretan]] palaces and the fortified citadels of [[Mycenae]], [[Tiryns]] and [[Hissarlik]], each containing little more than one great residence, surrounded by smaller buildings for the townsfolk. Pockets of local developments of art before the middle of the [[2nd millennium BC]] suggest the early existence of separate traditions, of which the strongest was the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]. After that date the evidence strongly suggests that one political dominion was spread for a brief period, or for two brief periods, over almost all the area. The great number of tribute-tallies found at [[Knossos]] perhaps indicates that the center of power was always there.

==Religion==
The fact that shrines have so far been found within palaces and not certainly anywhere else indicates that the kings kept religious power in their own hands. Perhaps they were themselves high-priests. [[Religion]] in the area seems to have been essentially the same everywhere from the earliest period, consisting of features like the cult of a [[Divine Principle]], resident in dominant features of nature (sun, stars, mountains, trees, etc.) and of controlling [[fertility]]. This cult passed through an [[aniconic]] stage, from which [[fetish]]es survived to the last, these being rocks or pillars, trees, weapons (e.g. [[bipennis]], or double [[war-axe]], [[shield]]), etc. When the [[iconic]] stage was reached, about [[2000 BC]], we find the Divine Spirit represented as a [[goddess]] with a subordinate young [[deity|god]], as in many other east [[Mediterranean]] lands. The god was probably son and mate of the goddess, and the divine pair represented the genius of [[Reproductive Fertility]] in its relations with humanity. The goddess sometimes appears with [[dove]]s, as [[uranic]] (heavenly), at others with [[snake]]s, as [[chthonic]] (earthly). In the ritual, fetishes, often of miniature form, played a great part: all sorts of plants and animals were [[sacred]]: sacrifice (not burnt, and not human), dedication of all sorts of offerings and [[simulacra]], [[invocation]], etc., were practised. The dead, who returned to the [[Great Mother]], were objects of a sort of [[hero]]-worship. This early nature-cult explains many anomalous features of [[Hellenic]] religion, especially in the cults of [[Artemis]] and [[Aphrodite]].

==Social Organization==
There is a possibility that features of a [[primeval]] [[matriarch]]ate long survived; but there is no certain evidence.  Of the organization of the people under the monarch we are ignorant. There are so few representations of armed men that it seems doubtful if there can have been any professional military class. Theatre-like structures found at [[Knossos]] and [[Phaestus]], within the precincts of the palaces, were perhaps used for shows or for sittings of a royal [[assize]], rather than for popular assemblies. The Minoan remains contain evidence of an elaborate system of registration, account-keeping and other secretarial work, which perhaps indicates a considerable body of law. The life of the ruling class was comfortable and even luxurious from early times. This can be seen by the fine stone palaces, richly decorated, with separate sleeping apartments, large halls, ingenious devices for admitting light and air, sanitary conveniences and marvellously modern arrangements for supply of water and for drainage. Even the smaller houses, after the [[Neolithic]] period, seem also to have been of stone, plastered within. After 1600 B.C. the palaces in Crete had more than one story, fine stairways, bath-chambers, windows, folding and sliding doors, etc. In this later period, the distinction of blocks of apartments in some palaces has been held to indicate the seclusion of women in [[Harem (household)|harem]]s, at least among the ruling caste. [[Minoa]]n [[fresco]]es show women grouped apart, and they appear alone on gems. Flesh and fish and many kinds of vegetables were evidently eaten, and [[wine]] and [[beer]] were drunk. Vessels for culinary, table, and luxurious uses show an infinite variety of form and purpose. Craftsmen's tools of many kinds were in use, [[bronze]] succeeding [[obsidian]] and other hard stones as the material. Seats are found carefully shaped to the human form. At least on Crete there was evidently a large-scale [[olive]]- and vine-culture. [[Chariot]]s were in use in the later period, as is proved by the pictures of them on Cretan tablets, and therefore, probably, the [[horse]] also was known. Indeed a horse appears on a gem impression. Main pathways were paved. [[Sport]]s, probably more or less religious, are often represented, e.g. bullfighting, dancing, boxing, armed combats.

==Commerce==
Commerce was practised to some extent in very early times, as is proved by the distribution of [[Melian]] [[obsidian]] over all the Aegean area and by the [[Nilotic]] influence on early Minoan art. We find Cretan vessels exported to [[Melos]], [[Egypt]] and the [[Greece|Greek]] mainland. Melian vases came in their turn to Crete. After 1600 B.C. there is very close commerce with Egypt, and Aegean things had their way to all coasts of the Mediterranean. No traces of [[currency]] have come to light, unless certain axeheads, too slight for practical use, had that character. Standard weights have been found, as well as representations of ingots. The Aegean written documents have not yet proved (by being found outside the area) to be [[epistolary]] (letter writing) correspondence with other countries. Representations of ships are not common, but several have been observed on Aegean gems, gem-sealings and vases. They are vessels of low free-board, with [[mast (sailing)|mast]]s. Familiarity with the sea is proved by the free use of marine motives in decoration.

Discoveries, later in the twentieth century, of sunken trading vesels round the coasts of the region have brought forth an enormous amount of new information about those times.

==Treatment of the Dead==
The dead in the earlier period were laid (so far as we know at present) within cysts constructed of upright stones. These were sometimes inside [[cave]]s. After the burial the cyst was covered in with earth. A little later, in Crete, bone-pits seem to have come into use, containing the remains of many burials. Possibly the flesh was boiled off the bones at once (&quot;scarification&quot;) or left to rot in separate cysts a while. Afterwards the skeletons would be collected and the cysts re-used. Coffins are of small size, contain corpses with the knees drawn up to the chin. They are found in excavated chambers or pits. In the later period, a peculiar [[Beehive tombs|&quot;bee-hive&quot; or &quot;tholos&quot; tomb]]s became common, sometimes wholly or partly excavated, sometimes (as in the magnificent Mycenaean &quot;treasuries&quot;) constructed domewise. The shaft-graves in the Mycenae circle are also a late type, paralleled in the later Minoan cemetery. The latest type of tomb is a flatly vaulted chamber approached by a horizontal or slightly inclined way, whose sides converge above. At no period do the Aegean dead seem to have been burned. Weapons, food, water, cosmetics  and various trinkets were laid with the corpse at all periods. In the Mycenae circle an altar seems to have been erected over the graves, and perhaps slaves were killed to bear the dead chiefs company. A painted [[sarcophagus]], found at [[Hagia Triada]], also possibly shows a hero-cult of the dead.

==Artistic Production==
Ceramic art reached a specially high standard in technique, form and decoration by the middle of the [[3rd millennium BC]] on Crete. The products of that period compare favorably with any potters' work in the world. The same may be said of fresco-painting, and probably of metal work. Modelling in [[terra cotta]], [[sculpture]] in stone and ivory, [[engraving]] on gems, were following it closely by the beginning of the 2nd millennium. After [[2000 BC]] all these arts revived, and sculpture, as evidenced by relief work, both on a large and on a small scale, carved stone vessels, [[metallurgy]] in [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[bronze]], advanced farther. This art and those of fresco- and vase-painting and of gem-engraving stood higher about the [[15th century BC|15th century B.C.]] than at any subsequent period before the 6th century. The manufacture, modelling and painting of [[faience]] objects, and the making of inlays in many materials were also familiar to Aegean craftsmen, who show in all their best work a strong sense of natural form and an appreciation of ideal balance and decorative effect, such as are seen in the best products of later [[Hellenic art]]. Architectural ornament was also highly developed. The richness of the Aegean capitals and columns may be judged by those from the &quot;Treasury of Atreus&quot; now set up in the [[British Museum]]; and of the [[frieze]]s we have examples in Mycenaean and Minoan fragments, and Minoan paintings. The magnificent gold work of the later period, preserved to us at [[Mycenae]] and [[Vaphio]], needs only to be mentioned. It should be compared with stone work in Crete, especially the [[steatite]] vases with reliefs found at [[Hagia Triada]]. On the whole, Aegean art at its two great periods, in the middle of the 3rd and 2nd millennia respectively, will bear comparison with any contemporary arts.

==Evidence of Aegean civilization==
For details of monumental evidence the articles on [[Crete]], [[Mycenae]], [[Tiryns]], [[Troad]], [[Cyprus]], etc., must be consulted. The most representative site explored up to now is [[Knossus|Cnossus]] (see [[Crete]]) which has yielded not only the most various but the most continuous evidence from the [[Neolithic age]] to the twilight of classical civilization. Next in importance come [[Hissarlik]], Mycenae, [[Phaestus]], [[Hagia Triada]], Tiryns, [[Phylakope]], [[Palaikastro]] and [[Gournia]]. 

'''A. INTERNAL EVIDENCE''' 
*'''Structures''';  [[Ruin]]s of [[palace]]s, palatial [[villa]]s, houses, built dome- or cist-graves and [[fortification]]s ([[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands, [[Greece|Greek]] mainland and northwestern [[Anatolia]]), but not distinct [[temple (Greek)|temples]]; small [[shrine]]s, however, and temene (religious enclosures, remains of one of which were probably found at [[Petsofa]] near Palaikastro by J. L. Myres in [[1904]]) are represented on [[intaglio]]s and [[fresco]]es.  From the sources and from inlay-work we have also representations of palaces and houses. 
*'''Structural Decoration''';  Architectural features, such as [[column]]s, [[frieze]]s and various [[molding|mouldings]]; [[mural]] decoration, such as fresco-paintings, coloured [[relief]]s and [[mosaic]] inlay. 
*'''[[Furniture]]''';  (a) Domestic furniture, such as [[vessel]]s of all sorts and in many materials, from huge store jars down to tiny [[unguent]] pots; culinary and other implements; [[throne]]s, [[chair|seats]], [[Furniture#Table|tables]], etc., these all in stone or plastered [[Terra cotta|terra-cotta]]. (b) Sacred furniture, such as models or actual examples of [[ritual]] objects; of these we have also numerous pictorial representations. (c) [[Funeral|Funerary]] furniture, e.g. [[coffin]]s in painted terra-cotta. 
*'''Art products''';  E.g. plastic objects, carved in [[Rock (geology)|stone]] or [[ivory]], cast or beaten in metals ([[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]] and [[bronze]]), or modelled in [[clay]], [[faience]], [[paste]], etc. Very little trace has yet been found of large free-standing [[sculpture]], but many examples exist of sculptors' smaller work.  [[Vase]]s of all kinds, carved in [[marble]] or other stones, cast or beaten in metals or fashioned in [[clay]], the latter in enormous number and variety, richly ornamented with coloured schemes, and sometimes bearing moulded decoration. Examples of painting on stone, opaque and transparent. Engraved objects in great number e.g. ring-bezels and [[gem]]s; and an immense quantity of clay impressions, taken from these. 
*'''[[Weapon]]s, [[tool]]s and implements''';  In stone, clay and bronze, and at the last [[iron]], sometimes richly ornamented or inlaid.  Numerous representations also of the same.  No actual body-[[armour]], except such as was ceremonial and buried with the dead, like the gold breastplates in the circle-graves at Mycenae. 
*'''Articles of personal use''';  E.g. [[brooch]]es (fibulae), [[pin]]s, [[razor]]s, [[tweezers]], etc., often found as dedications to a deity, e.g. in the Dictaean Cavern of Crete.  No [[textile]]s have survived. 
*'''Written documents''';  E.g. clay tablets and discs (so far in Crete only), but nothing of more perishable nature, such as skin, [[papyrus]], etc.; engraved gems and gem impressions; [[legend]]s written with [[pigment]] on [[pottery]] (rare); characters incised on stone or pottery.  These show two main systems of script (see [[Crete]]). 
*'''Excavated [[tomb]]s''';  Of either the pit or the [[grotto]] kind, in which the dead were laid, together with various objects of use and luxury, without cremation, and in either coffins or loculi or simple wrappings. 
*'''Public works''';  Such as paved and stepped roadways, bridges, systems of drainage, etc. 

'''B. EXTERNAL EVIDENCE'''
*'''Monuments and records of other contemporary civilizations''';  E.g. representations of alien peoples in Egyptian frescoes; imitation of Aegean fabrics and style in non-Aegean lands; allusions to [[Mediterranean]] peoples in [[Egypt]]ian, [[Semitic]] or [[Babylon]]ian records. 
*'''Literary traditions of subsequent civilizations''';  Especially the Hellenic; such as, e.g., those embodied in the [[Homer]]ic poems, the legenda concerning Crete, Mycenae, etc.; statements as to the origin of [[deity|god]]s, [[cult]]s and so forth, transmitted to us by Hellenic antiquarians such as [[Strabo]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], etc.

There are also possible [[linguistics|linguistic]] and even physical survivals to be considered.
[[Mycenae]] and [[Tiryns]] are the two principal sites on which evidence of a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] [[Civilization|civilization]] was remarked long ago by the [[Classical antiquity|classical Greeks]].

==The discovery of Aegean civiliation==
The curtain-wall and towers of the Mycenaean [[citadel]], its gate with heraldic lions, and the great &quot;Treasury of [[Atreus]]&quot; had borne silent witness for ages before [[Heinrich Schliemann]]'s time; but they were supposed only to speak to the [[Homer|Homeric]], or at farthest a rude Heroic beginning of purely [[History of Greece|Hellenic]], civilization. It was not until Schliemann exposed the contents of the graves which lay just inside the gate, that scholars recognized the advanced stage of [[art]] to which prehistoric dwellers in the Mycenaean citadel had attained. 

There had been, however, a good deal of other evidence available before [[1876]], which, had it been collated and seriously studied, might have discounted the sensation that the discovery of the citadel graves eventually made. Although it was recognized that certain tributaries, represented e.g. in the XVIIIth Dynasty tomb of Rekhmara at [[Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as bearing vases of peculiar forms, were of some [[Mediterranean]] race, neither their precise habitat nor the degree of their civilization could be determined while so few actual prehistoric remains were known in the [[Mediterranean]] lands.  Nor did the [[Aegean Sea |Aegean]] objects which were lying obscurely in museums in [[1870]], or thereabouts, provide a sufficient test of the real basis underlying the Hellenic myths of the [[Argos|Argolid]], the [[Troad]] and [[Crete]], to cause these to he taken seriously.  Aegean vases have been exhibited both at [[Sèvres|Sevres]] and [[Neuchâtel|Neuchatel]] since about [[1840]], the provenience (i.e. source or origin) being in the one case Phylakope in [[Milos|Melos]], in the other [[Kefallinia|Cephalonia]].  

Ludwig Ross, the [[Germany|German]] [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] appointed Curator of the Antiquities of [[History of Athens|Athens]] at the time of the establishment of the Kingdom of [[Greece]], by his explorations in the Greek islands from 1835 onwards, called attention to certain early [[intaglio]]s, since known as Inselsteine; but it was not until [[1878]] that C. T. Newton demonstrated these to be no strayed [[Phoenicia|Phoenician]] products. In [[1866]] primitive structures were discovered on the island of Therasia by quarrymen extracting pozzolana, a [[Silicon dioxide|siliceous]] [[Volcanic ash|volcanic ash]], for the [[Suez Canal]] works.  When this discovery was followed up in [[1870]], on the neighbouring [[Santorini|Santorin (Thera)]], by representatives of the French School at [[Athens]], much pottery of a class now known immediately to precede the typical late Aegean ware, and many stone and metal objects, were found.  These were dated by the [[geologist]] Ferdinand A. Fouqué, somewhat arbitrarily, to 2000 B.C., by consideration of the superincumbent eruptive stratum.  

Meanwhile, in [[1868]], tombs at Ialysus in [[Rhodes]] had yielded to Alfred  Biliotti many fine painted vases of styles which were called later the third and fourth &quot;Mycenaean&quot;; but these, bought by [[John Ruskin]], and presented to the [[British Museum]], excited less attention than they deserved, being supposed to be of some local Asiatic fabric of uncertain date.  Nor was a connection immediately detected between them and the objects found four years later in a tomb at Menidi in [[Attica]] and a rock-cut &quot;bee-hive&quot; grave near the Argive Heraeum. 

Even Schliemann's first [[excavation]]s at Hissarlik in the [[Troad]] did not excite surprise.  But the &quot;Burnt City&quot; of his second stratum, revealed in [[1873]], with its fortifications and vases, and a hoard of [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[bronze]] objects, which the discoverer connected with it, began to arouse a curiosity which was destined presently to spread far outside the narrow circle of scholars. As soon as Schliemann came on the Mycenae graves three years later, light poured from all sides on the prehistoric period of [[Greece]].  It was recognized that the character of both the fabric and the decoration of the Mycenaean objects was not that of any well-known art. A wide range in space was proved by the identification of the Inselsteine and the Ialysus vases with the new style, and a wide range in time by collation of the earlier Theraean and Hissarlik discoveries. A relationship between objects of art described by [[Homer]] and the Mycenaean treasure was generally allowed, and a correct opinion prevailed that, while certainly posterior, the civilization of the [[Iliad]] was reminiscent of the Mycenaean. 

Schliemann got to work again at Hissarlik in [[1878]], and greatly increased our knowledge of the lower strata, but did not recognize the Aegean remains in his &quot;Lydian&quot; city of the sixth stratum.  These were not to be fully revealed until Dr. Wilhelm Dorpfeld, who had become Schliemann's assistant in [[1879]], resumed the work at Hissarlik in [[1892]] after the first explorer's death. But by laying bare in [[1884]] the upper stratum of remains on the rock of [[Tiryns]], Schliemann made a contribution to our knowledge of prehistoric domestic life which was amplified two years later by Christos Tsountas's discovery of the Mycenae palace. Schliemann's work at Tiryns was not resumed till 1905, when it was proved, as had long been suspected, that an earlier palace underlies the one he had exposed. 

From 1886 dates the finding of Mycenaean [[sepulchre]]s outside the Argolid, from which, and from the continuation of Tsountas's exploration of the buildings and lesser graves at Mycenae, a large treasure, independent of Schliemann's princely gift, has been gathered into the National Museum at [[Athens]]. In that year dome-tombs, most already rifled but retaining some of their furniture, were excavated at Arkina and [[Eleusis]] in Attica, at Dimini near Volo in [[Thessaly]], at Kampos on the west of Mount Taygetus, and at Maskarata in [[Kefallinia|Cephalonia]]. The richest grave of all was explored at Vaphio in [[Laconia]] in [[1889]], and yielded, besides many gems and miscellaneous goldsmiths' work, two golden goblets chased with scenes of bull-hunting, and certain broken vases painted in a large bold style which remained an enigma until the excavation of [[Knossos|Cnossus]]. 

In [[1890]] and [[1893]] Staes cleared out certain, less rich dome-tombs at Thoricus in [[Attica]]; and other graves, either rock-cut &quot;bee-hives&quot; or chambers, were found at Spata and Aphidna in Attica, in [[Aegina]] and [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], at the Heraeum (see [[Argos]]) and Nauplia in the Argolid, near [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Delphi]], and not far from the [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] [[Larissa]].  During the [[Acropolis]] excavations in [[Athens]], which terminated in [[1888]], many potsherds of the Mycenaean style were found; but Olympia had yielded either none, or such as had not been recognized before being thrown away, and the temple site at [[Delphi]] produced nothing distinctively Aegean. The [[United States|American]] explorations of the Argive Heraeum, concluded in [[1895]], also failed to prove that site to have been important in the prehistoric time, though, as was to be expected from its neighbourhood to Mycenae itself, there were traces of occupation in the later Aegean periods.  

Prehistoric research had now begun to extend beyond the Greek mainland.  Certain central Aegean islands, Antiparos, [[Ios]], Amorgos, Syros and Siphnos, were all found to be singularly rich in evidence of the middle-Aegean period. The series of Syran built graves, containing crouching corpses, is the best and most representative that is known in the Legean.  Melos, long marked as a source of early objects but not systematically excavated until taken in hand by the [[United Kingdom|British]] School at [[Athens]] in [[1896]], yielded at Phylakope remains of all the Aegean periods, except the [[Neolithic]]. 

A map of [[Cyprus]] in the later [[Bronze Age]] (such as is given by J. L. Myres and M. O. Richter in Catalogue of the [[Cyprus]] Museum) shows more than twenty-five settlements in and about the Mesaorea district alone, of which one, that at Enkomi, near the site of Salamis, has yielded the richest Aegean treasure in precious metal found outside Mycenae.  E. Chantre in [[1894]] picked up lustreless ware, like that of Hissariik, in central Phtygia and at Pteria (q.v.), and the [[England|English]] archaeological expeditions, sent subsequently into north-western [[Anatolia]], have never failed to bring back ceramic specimens of Aegean appearance from the valleys of the Rhyndncus, Sangarius and Halys. 

In [[Egypt]] in [[1887]] W. M. F. Petrie found painted sherds of Cretan style at [[Kahun]] in the [[Al Fayyum|Fayum]], and farther up the [[Nile]], at [[Amarna|Tell el-Amarna]], chanced on bits of no fewer than 800 Aegean vases in [[1889]]. There have now been recognized in the collections at [[Cairo]], [[Florence]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Bologna]] several Egyptian imitations of the Aegean style which can be set off against the many debts which the centres of Aegean culture owed to Egypt.  Two Aegean vases were found at [[Sidon]] in [[1885]], and many fragments of Aegean and especially Cypriote pottery have been turned up during recent excavations of sites in [[Philistines|Philistia]] by the [[Palestine Fund]].  

Southeastern [[Sicily]], ever since P. Orsi excavated the Sicel cemetery near Lentini in [[1877]], has proved a mine of early remains, among which appear in regular succession Aegean fabrics and motives of decoration from the period of the second stratum at Hissarlik. Sardinia has Aegean sites, e.g. at Abini near Teti; and [[Spain]] has yielded objects recognized as Aegean from tombs near [[Cádiz|Cadiz]] and from [[Zaragoza, Spain|Saragossa]]. 

One land, however, has eclipsed all others in the Aegean by the wealth of its remains of all the prehistoric ages&amp;mdash; Crete; and so much so that, for the present, we must regard it as the fountainhead of Aegean civilization, and probably for long its political and social centre. The island first attracted the notice of archaeologists by the remarkable archaic Greek bronzes found in a cave on [[Mount Ida]] in [[1885]], as well as by [[Epigraph|epigraphic]] [[monument]]s such as the famous law of Gortyna.  But the first undoubted Aegean remains reported from it were a few objects extracted from Cnossus by Minos Kalokhairinos of Candia in [[1878]]. These were followed by certain discoveries made in the S. plain Messara by F. Halbherr.  Unsuccessful attempts at Cnossus were made by both W. J. Stillman and H. Schliemann, and A. J. Evans, coming on the scene in [[1893]], travelled in succeeding years about the island picking up trifles of unconsidered evidence, which gradually convinced him that greater things would eventually be found. He obtained enough to enable him to forecast the discovery of written characters, till then not suspected in Aegean civilization. The revolution of [[1897]]-98 opened the door to wider knowledge, and much exploration has ensued, for which see [[Crete]]. 

Thus the &quot;Aegean Area&quot; has now come to mean the [[Archipelago]] with Crete and [[Cyprus]], the Hellenic peninsula with the [[Ionian Islands|Ionian islands]], and Western [[Anatolia]].  Evidence is still wanting for the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian]] and [[Thrace|Thracian]] coasts. Offshoots are found in the western [[Mediterranean]] area, in [[Sicily]], [[Italy]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Spain]], and in the eastern Mediterranean area in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]].  About the [[Cyrenaica]] we are still insufficiently informed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Greek mythology]], '''Aegeus''', also '''Aigeus''', '''Aegeas''' or '''Aigeas''', was the father of [[Theseus]] and an [[Kings of Athens|Athenian King]].  He was the son of [[Pandion II]] and a brother of [[Pallas]], [[Nisos]], and [[Lykos]].

Upon the death of Pandion, Aegeus and his brothers took control of [[Athens]] from [[Metion]], who had seized the throne from Pandion.  They divided the government in four but Aegeas became king.  His first wife was [[Meta]] and the second was [[Chalciope]].

Still without a male heir, Aegeus asked the [[Delphic Sibyl|Oracle]] at [[Delphi]] for advice.  Her cryptic words were &quot;Do not loosen the bulging mouth of the wineskin until you have reached the height of Athens, lest you die of grief.&quot; 

Aegeus (king of Athens) went to [[Troezen|Troezena]] and met with [[Aethra]], daughter of Troezena's king [[Pittheus]]. Pittheus understood the prophesy and introduced Aegeas to his daughter, Aethra, when he was drunk.  They had sex and then, in some versions, Aethra waded out to the sea to [[Sphairia]] and had sex with [[Poseidon]].  When she fell pregnant, Aegeus decided to go back to Athens. Before leaving, he covered his sandals, shield and sword under a huge rock and told her that when their son grew up, he should move the rock and bring the weapons back.  Upon his return to Athens, Aegeus married [[Medea]] who had fled from [[Corinth]] and the wrath of [[Jason]].  Aegeus and Medea had one son together named [[Medus]]. 

In Troezen, Theseus grew up and became a brave young man.  He managed to move the rock and took his father's arms.  His mother then told him the truth about who his father was and how he should take the weapons back to him.  Theseus decided to go to Athens and had the choice of going by sea, which was the safe way or by land, following a dangerous path with thieves and bandits all the way.  Young, brave and ambitious, Theseus decided to go to Athens by land.

When Theseus arrived, he did not reveal his true identity.  He was welcomed by Aegeas, who was suspicious about the stranger who came to Athens.  Medea  tried to have Aegeas kill Theseus by asking him to capture the [[Marathonian Bull]], but Theseus succeeded.  She tried to poison him but at the last second, Aegeas recognized the sandals, shield and sword and knocked the wine glass out of Theseus' hand.  Father and son were reunited.

While visiting in Athens, King [[Minos]]' son, [[Androgeus]], managed to defeat Aegeus in every contest during a feast. Out of jealousy, Aegeus killed him.  Minos was angry and declared war on Athens.  He offered the Athenians peace, however, under the condition that Athens would send seven young men and seven young women every year to [[Crete]] to be fed to the [[Minotaur]], a vicious monster.  This continued until Theseus killed the Minotaur with the help of Ariadne, Minos' daughter.

Aegeus had told Theseus, before he left, to put up the white sails when he left Crete, if he had been successful in killing the Minotaur.  Theseus forgot (deliberately, according to some accounts) and Aegeus jumped into the sea when he saw the black sails coming into Athens, in the mistaken belief that his son had been slain, thus fulfilling the prophecy.  Henceforth, this sea was known as the [[Aegean Sea]].

'''Aegina ''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Αίγινα ''Egina''), one of the [[Greek islands|Saronic Islands]] of [[Greece]] in the [[Saronic Gulf]], 31 miles (50 km)  from [[Athens]]. [[Tradition]] derives the name from Aegina, the mother of [[Aeacus]], who was born in and ruled the island.  In shape Aegina is triangular, eight miles (13 km) long from northwest to southeast, and six miles (15 km) broad, with an area of about 41 square miles (106 km²).  Two thirds of Aegina constitute an extinct volcano. The northern and western side consist of stony but fertile plains, which are well cultivated and produce luxuriant crops of grain, with some [[cotton]], vines, [[almond]]s, olives and [[fig]]s, but the most characteristic crop of today (1990s) Aegina is the [[pistachio]]. The southern volcanic part of the island is rugged and mountainous, and largely barren.  Its highest rise is the conical Mount Oros in the south, and the Panhellenian ridge stretches northward with narrow fertile valleys on either side.  From the absence of marshes the climate is the most healthy in Greece.

The island forms part of the modern Uomos of Attica and Boeotia, of which it forms an eparchy. The sponge fisheries are of considerable importance.  The capital is the town of Aegina, situated at the northwestern end of the island, the summer residence of many Athenian merchants.  [[Capo d'Istria]] (1776-1831) had a large building erected intended for a barracks, which was subsequently used as a museum, a library and a school.  The museum was the first institution of its kind in Greece, but the collection was transferred to [[Athens]] in [[1834]]. A statue in the principal square comemorates him.  

== Antiquities ==
[[Image:Glypto aegina.JPG|thumb|[[Athena]] from the east pediment of the Aphaea temple in Aegina]]
The archaeological interest of Aegina is centred in the well-known temple on the ridge near the northern corner of the island.  Excavations were made on its site in [[1811]] by Baron [[Haller von Hallerstein]] and the English architect C. R. Cockerell, who discovered a considerable number of the sculptures from the pediment, which was bought in [[1812]] by the crown prince Louis of Bavaria; the groups were set up in the [[Glyptothek]] at [[Munich]] after the figures had been restored by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. His restoration was somewhat drastic, the ancient parts being cut away to allow of additions in marble, and the new parts treated in imitation of the ancient weathering.

Various conjectures were made as to the arrangement of the figures.  That according to which they were set up at Munich was in the main suggested by Cockerell; in the middle of each pediment was a figure of Athena, set well back, and a fallen warrior at her feet; on each side were standing spearmen, kneel ing spearmen and bowmen, all facing towards the centre of the composition; the corners were filled with fallen warriors.  In [[1901]] Professor [[Adolf Furtwängler]] began a more systematic excavation of the site, and the new discoveries he then made, together with a fresh and complete study of the figures and fragments in Munich, have led to a rearrangement of the whole, which, if not certain in all details, may be regarded as approaching finality.  According to this the figures of combatants do not all face towards the centre, but are broken up, as in other early compositions, into a series of groups of two or three figures each.

A figure of Athena still occupies the centre of each pediment, but is set farther forward than in the old reconstruction.  On each side of this, in the western pediment, is a group of two combatants over a fallen warrior; in the eastern pediment, a warrior whose opponent is falling into the arms of a supporting figure; other figures also &amp;ndash; the bowmen especially &amp;ndash; face towards the angles, and so give more variety to the composition.  The western pediment, which is more conservative in type, represents the earlier expedition of Heracles and Telamon against Troy; the eastern, which is bolder and more advanced, probably refers to episodes in the Trojan war.  There are also remains of a third pediment, which may have been produced in competition, but never placed on the temple.  For the character of the sculptures see [[Greek Art]]. The plan of the temple is chiefly remarkable for the unsymmetrically placed door leading from the back of the [[cella]] into the [[opisthodomus]].  This opisthodomus was completely fenced in with bronze gratings; and the excavators believe it to have been adapted for use as an adytum (shrine).  It was disputed in earlier times whether the temple was dedicated to Zeus or Athena.  Inscriptions found by the recent excavations seem to prove that it must be identified as the shrine of the local goddess Aphaea, identified by Pausanias with Britomartis and Dictynna. 

These and further German-Greek excavations in the 1960's and 1970's have laid bare several other buildings, including an altar, early propylaea, houses for the priests and remains of two earlier temples.  The present temple probably dates from the time of the [[Persian Wars]].  In the town of Aegina itself are the remains of another temple, dedicated to Aphrodite; one column of this still remains standing, and its foundations are fairly preserved. The fundaments of another two temples are known on the island, one of which is on the northern flank of Mt. Oros, today topped by a church.

== Ancient History ==
Aegina, according to [[Herodotus]] (v. 83), was a [[colony]] of [[Epidaurus]], to which state it was originally subject.  The discovery in the island of a number of gold ornaments belonging to the latest period of [[Mycenaean]] art suggests the inference that the Mycenaean culture held its own in Aegina for some generations after the [[Dorian]] conquest of Argos and Lacedaemon (see A. J. Evans, in Journal of Hellenic Studies, vol. xiii. p. 195).  It is probable that the island was not dorized before the [[9th century BC]] One of the earliest facts known to us in its history is its membership in the League of [[Calauria]], which included, besides Aegina, Athens, the Minyan (Boeotian) Orchomenos, Troezen, Hermione, Nauplia and Prasiae, and was probably an organization of states which were still Mycenaean, for the oppression of the piracy which had sprung up in the Aegean as a result of the decay of the naval supremacy of the Mycenaean princes.

It follows, therefore, that the maritime importance of the island dates back to pre-Dorian times.  It is usually stated on the authority of Ephorus, that [[Pheidon]] of Argos established a mint in Aegina.  Though this statement is probably to be rejected, it may be regarded as certain that Aegina was the first state of European Greece to coin money.  Thus it was the Aeginetes who, within thirty or forty years of the invention of coinage by the [[Lydians]] (c. [[700 BC]]), introduced to the western world a system of such incalculable value to trade.  The fact that the Aeginetan scale of coins, weights and measures was one of the two scales in general use in the Greek world is sufficient evidence of the early commercial importance of the island.  
It appears to have belonged to the [[Eretrian]] league during the [[Lelante War]]; hence, perhaps, we may explain the war with [[Samos Island|Samos]], a leading member of the rival Chalcidian league in the reign of King [[Amphicrates]] (Herod. iii. 59), i.e. not later than the earlier half of the 7th century B.C. 
In the next century Aegina is one of the three principal states trading at the emporium of [[Naucratis]], and it is the only state of European Greece that has a share in this factory (Herod. ii. 178).  
At the beginning of the [[5th century]] it seems to have been an entrepot of the Pontic grain trade, at a later date an Athenian monopoly (Herod. vii. 147).  Unlike the other commercial states of the 7th and 6th centuries B.C., e.g. Corinth, Chalcis, Eretria and Miletus, Aegina founded no colonies.  
The settlements to which Strabo refers (viii. 376) cannot be regarded as any real exceptions to this statement. 

The history of Aegina, as it has come down to us, is almost exclusively a history of its relations with the neighbouring state of Athens.  The history of these relations, as recorded by Herodotus (v. 79-89; vi. 49-51, 73, 85-94), involve critical problems of some difficulty and interest.  He traces back the hostility of the two states to a dispute about the images of the goddesses Damia and Auxesia, which the Aeginetes had carried off from [[Epidaurus|Epidauros]], their parent state.  The Epidaurians had been accustomed to make annual offerings to the Athenian deities Athena and Erechtheus in payment for the Athenian olive-wood of which the statues were made.  Upon the refusal of the Aeginetes to continue these offerings, the [[Athenians]] endeavoured to carry away the images.  Their design was miraculously frustrated &amp;ndash; according to the Aeginetan version, the statues fell upon their knees &amp;ndash; and only a single survivor returned to Athens, there to fall a victim to the fury of his comrades' widows, who pierced him with their brooch-pins.  No date is assigned by Herodotus for this ''old feud''; recent writers, e.g. [[J. B. Bury]] and R. W. Macan, suggest the period between Solon and Peisistratus, circa [[570 BC]]. 
It may be questioned, however, whether the whole episode is not mythical.  A critical analysis of the narrative seems to reveal little else than a series of aetiological traditions (explanatory of cults and customs, e.g. of the kneeling posture of the images of Damia and Auxesia, of the use of native ware instead of Athenian in their worship, and of the change in women's dress at Athens from the Dorian to the [[Ionia|Ionian]] style.  

The account which Herodotus gives of the hostilities between the two states in the early years of the [[5th century BC]] is to the following effect.  Thebes, after the defeat by Athens about [[507 BC]], appealed to Aegina for assistance.  The Aeginetans at first contented themselves with sending the images of the Aeacidae, the [[tutelary]] heroes of their island.  Subsequently, however, they entered into an alliance, and ravaged the sea-board of Attica.  The Athenians were preparing to make reprisals, in spite of the advice of the [[Delphic oracle]] that they should desist from attacking Aegina for thirty years, and content themselves meanwhile with dedicating a precinct to Aeacus, when their projects were interrupted by the Spartan intrigues for the restoration of [[Hippias]].  In [[401 BC]] Aegina was one of the states which gave the symbols of submission (''earth and water'') to Persia.  Athens at once appealed to Sparta to punish this act of medism, and [[Cleomenes I]], one of the Spartan kings, crossed over to the island, to arrest those who were responsible for it.  His attempt was at first unsuccessful; but, after the deposition of [[Demaratus]], he visited the island a second time, accompanied by his new colleague Leotychides, seized ten of the leading citizens and deposited them at Athens as hostages.

After the death of Cleomenes and the refusal of the Athenians to restore the hostages to Leotychides, the Aeginetans retaliated by seizing a number of Athenians at a festival at Sunium.  Thereupon the Athenians concerted a plot with Nicodromus, the leader of the democratic party in the island, for the betrayal of Aegina.  He was to seize the old city, and they were to come to his aid on the same day with seventy vessels.  The plot failed owing to the late arrival of the Athenian force, when [[Nicodromus]] had already fled the island.  An engagement followed in which the Aeginetans were defeated.  Subsequently, however, they succeeded in winning a victory over the Athenian fleet.  Alf the incidents subsequent to the appeal of Athens to Sparta are expressly referred by Herodotus to the interval between the sending of the heralds in [[491 BC]] and the invasion of Datis and Artaphernes in [[490 BC]] (cf. Herod. vi. 49 with 94). There are difficulties in this story, of which the following are the principal: &amp;ndash; (i.) Herodotus nowhere states or implies that peace was concluded between the two states before [[481 BC]], nor does he distinguish between different wars during this period.  Hence it would follow that the war lasted from shortly after [[507 BC]] down to the congress at the Isthmus of Corinth in [[481 BC]] (ii.) It is only for two years ([[490 BX|490]] and [[491 BC|491]]) out of the twenty-five that any details are given.  It is the more remarkable that no incidents are recorded in the period between [[battle of Marathon|Marathon]] and [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], seeing that at the time of the Isthmian Congress the war is described as the most important one then being waged in Greece (Herod. vii. 145). (iii.) It is improbable that Athens would have sent twenty vessels to the aid of the Ionians in [[499 BC]] if at the time she was at war with Aegina. (iv.) There is an incidental indication of time, which points to the period after Marathon as the true date for the events which are referred by Herodotus to the year before Marathon, viz. the thirty years that were to elapse between the dedication of the precinct to Aeacus and the final victory of Athens (Herod. v. 89).

As the final victory of Athens over Aegina was in 458 B.C., the thirty years of the oracle would carry us back to the year [[488 BC]] as the date of the dedication of the precinct and the outbreak of hostilities.  This inference is supported by the date of the building of the 200 triremes ''for the war against Aegina'' on the advice of [[Themistocles]], which is given in the Constitutiom of Athens as 483-482 B.C. (Herod. vii. 144; Ath. Pol. r2. 7). It is probable, therefore, that Herodotus is in error both in tracing back the beginning of hostilities to an alliance between Thebes and Aegina (c. 507 BC) and in putting the episode of Nicodromus before Marathon.  Overtures were unquestionably made by Thebes for an alliance with Aegina c. [[507 BC]], but they came to nothing.  The refusal of Aegina was veiled under the diplomatic form of ''sending the Aeacidae.'' The real occasion of the outbreak of the war was the refusal of Athens to restore the hostages some twenty years later.  There was but one war, and it lasted from 488 to 481. That Athens had the worst of it in this war is certain. Herodotus had no Athenian victories to record after the initial success, and the fact that Themistocles was able to carry his proposal to devote the surplus funds of the state to the building of so large a fleet seems to imply that the Athenians were themselves convinced that a supreme effort was necessary.  It may be noted, in confirmation of this view, that the naval supremacy of Aegina is assigned by the ancient writers on chronology to precisely this period, i.e. the years 490-480 ([[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], Chron.  Can. p. 337). 

In the repulse of [[Xerxes I]] it is possible that the Aeginetans played a larger part than is conceded to them by Herodotus.  The Athenian tradition, which he follows in the main, would naturally seek to obscure their services.  It was to Aegina rather than Athens that the prize of valour at Salamis was awarded, and the destruction of the Persian fleet appears to have been as much the work of the Aeginetan contingent as of the Athenian (Herod. viii. 91). There are other indications, too, of the importance of the Aeginetan fleet in the Greek scheme of defence.  In view of these considerations it becomes difficult to credit the number of the vessels that is assigned to them by Herodotus (30 as against 180 Athenian vessels, cf. [[Greek History]], sect. Authorities).  During the next twenty years the Philo-laconian policy of [[Cimon]] secured Aegina, as a member of the Spartan league, from attack.  The change in Athenian foreign policy, which was consequent upon the ostracism of Cimon in 461, led to what is sometimes called the First Peloponnesian War, in which the brunt of the fighting fell upon Corinth and Aegina.  The latter state was forced to surrender to Athens after a siege, and to accept the position of a subject-ally (c. 456 B.C.).  The tribute was fixed at 30 talents.  

By the terms of the Thirty Years' Truce ([[445 BC]]) Athens covenanted to restore to Aegina her autonomy, but the clause remained a dead letter.  In the first winter of the [[Peloponnesian War]] ([[431 BC]]) Athens expelled the Aeginetans, and established a cleruchy in their island.  The exiles were settled by Sparta in Thyreatis, on the frontiers of Laconia and Argolis.  Even in their new home they were not safe from Athenian rancour.1 A force landed under Nicias in [[424 BC|424]], and put most of them to the sword.  At the end of the Peloponnesian War Lysander restored the scattered remnants of the old inhabitants to the island, which was used by the Spartans as a base for operations against Athens in the Corinthian War. Its greatness, however, was at an end.  The part which it plays henceforward is insignificant. 

It would be a mistake to attribute the fall of Aegina solely to the development of the Athenian navy.  It is probable that the powor of Aegina had steadily declined during the twenty years after Sabamis, and that it had declined absolutely, as well as relatively, to that of Athens.  Commerce was the source of Aegina's greatness, and her trade, which appears to have been principally with the Levant, must have suffered seriously from the war with [[Iran|Persia]].  Her medism in [[491 BC|491]] is to be explained by her commercial relations with the Persian Empire.  She was forced into patriotism in spite of herself, and the glory won by [[Salamis]] was paid for by the loss of her trade and the decay of her marine.  The completeness of the ruin of so powerful a state &amp;ndash; we should look in vain for an analogous case in the history of the modern world &amp;ndash; finds an explanation in the economic conditions of the island, the prosperity of which rested upon a basis of slave-labour.  It is impossible, indeed, to accept Aristotle's (cf. Athenaeus vi. 272) estimate of 470,000 as the number of the slave-population; it is clear, however, that the number must have been out of all proportion to that of the free inhabitants.  In this respect the history of Aegina does but anticipate the history of Greece as a whole.  The constitutional history of Aegina is unusually simple.  So long as the island retained its independence the government was an oligarchy.  There is no trace of the heroic monarchy and no tradition of a tyrannis. The story of Nicodromus, while it proves the existence of a democratic party, suggests, at the same time, that it could count upon little support.

Pericles called Aegina the ''eye-sore'' (leme) of the Peiraeus. The physician [[Paul of Aegina]] came from here, and was the most respected medical scholar of the [[Byzantine Empire]] for many years.

== Modern  History ==
Aegina passed with the rest of Greece under the successive dominations of Macedon, the Aetolians, Attalus of Pergamum and [[Roman empire|Rome]].  In [[1537]] the island, then a prosperous Venetian colony, was overrun and ruined by the pirate Barbarossa (Khair-ed-Din).  One of the last Venetian strongholds in the Levant, it was ceded by the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] ([[1718]]) to the Turks.  In [[1826]]-[[1828]] the town became for two years (Jan. 1828 - Dec. 1829) the first capital of Modern Greece. Today Aegina is a famous tourist destination. It takes about 35 minutes to arrive in Aegina from the Piraus port.

When Zeus abducted Aegina, he took her to [[Oenone]], an island close to [[Attica]]. This island would later be called Aegina. Here, Aegina gave birth to Aeacus, who would later become king of Oenone; henceforth, Aegina.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{otheruses}}

'''Aegis ''' (Gr. ''&amp;#913;&amp;#953;&amp;#947;&amp;#943;&amp;#962;''), in [[Homer]], is the [[shield]] or buckler of [[Zeus]], fashioned for him by [[Hephaestus]], furnished with tassels and bearing the [[Gorgon]]'s head in the centre.  Originally symbolic of the storm-cloud, it is probably derived from ''aisso'', signifying rapid, violent motion.  Another possible etymology is from the root ''&amp;#913;&amp;#953;&amp;#947;-'' (Aeg-) meaning wave, as per ''&amp;#913;&amp;#953;&amp;#947;&amp;#945;&amp;#943;&amp;#959;&amp;#957;'' (Aegean) = wavy sea. When the god shakes it, [[Mount Ida]] is wrapped in clouds, the thunder rolls and men are smitten with fear.  He sometimes lends it to [[Athena]] and (rarely) to [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]. According to Part One, Section One of [[Edith Hamilton]]'s &quot;Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes&quot; (Warner Books' United States Paperback Edition), the Aegis is [[Zeus]]' [[breastplate]], and was &quot;awful to behold.&quot;

In a later story ([[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], Poet.  Astronom. ii. 13) Zeus is said to have used the skin of the [[goat]] [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]] (aigis=goat-skin) which suckled him in [[Crete]], as a buckler when he went forth to do battle against the giants.  There is also the legend which represents the aegis as a fire-breathing monster like the [[Chimera (creature)|Chimera]], which was slain by Athena, who afterwards wore its skin as a [[cuirass]] ([[Diodorus Siculus]] iii. 70).  Still others say it was the skin of the monstrous giant [[Pallas (disambiguation)|Pallas]].

Another version describes it to have been really the goat's skin used as a belt to support the shield.  When so used it would generally be fastened on the right shoulder, and would partially envelop the chest as it passed obliquely round in front and behind to be attached to the shield under the left arm.  Hence, by [[metonymy]], it would be employed to denote at times the shield which it supported, and at other times a cuirass, the purpose of which it in part served.  In accordance with this double meaning, the aegis appears in works of art sometimes as an animal's skin thrown over the shoulders and arms, and sometimes as a cuirass, with a border of snakes corresponding to the tassels of Homer, usually with the Gorgon's head in the centre.  It is often represented on the statues of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperors, heroes, and warriors, and on cameos and vases. 

The aegis also appears in [[Egyptian Mythology]].  The goddess [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]] was sometimes depicted holding a ceremonial [[sistrum]] in one hand and an aegis in the other -- the aegis usually resembling a collar or [[gorget]] embellished with a lion's head.

Also, in [[Norse Mythology]], the dwarf [[Fafnir]] wears a helmet named Aegis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Greek mythology]], '''Aegisthus''' (&quot;goat strength&quot;, also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Aegisthos''' or '''Aigísthos''') was the son of [[Thyestes]] and his daughter, [[Pelopia]].

Thyestes felt he had been deprived of the [[Mycenae|Mycenean]] throne unfairly by his brother, [[Atreus]].  The two battled back and forth several times.  In addition, Thyestes had an affair with Atreus' wife, [[Aerope]].  In revenge, Atreus killed Thyestes' sons and served them to him unknowingly.  After eating his own sons' corpses, Thyestes asked an [[oracle]] how best to gain revenge.  The advice was to father a son with his own daughter, Pelopia, and that son would kill Atreus.

When Aegisthus was born, his mother was ashamed of her incestuous act.  She abandoned him and he was raised by shepherds and suckled by a goat.  Atreus, not knowing the baby's origin, took Aegisthus in and raised him as his own.  When Aegisthus reached adulthood, Thyestes revealed his true parentage, that he was both father and grandfather to Aegisthus, who then killed Atreus and seized the throne.

Aegisthus and Thyestes ruled over [[Mycenae]] jointly, exiling Atreus' sons, [[Agamemnon]] and [[Menelaus]] to [[Sparta]], where King [[Tyndareus]] gave the pair his daughters, [[Clytemnestra]] and [[Helen]], to take as wives. At his death, Tyndareus gave his throne to Menelaus, who then helped Agamemnon overthrow Aegisthus and Thyestes.

After Agamemnon left Mycenae for the [[Trojan War]], Aegisthus wanted to seduce his wife, Clytemnestra (mother of [[Erigone]]). Agamemnon had left Clytemnestra with a singer; as long as the singer was present, Clytemnestra resisted Aegisthus. Aegisthus then took the singer to a deserted island, and Clytemnestra was seduced. On the kings' return after the ten-year war, Aegisthus helped Clytemnestra kill Agamemnon (and his new concubine, [[Cassandra]]); they subsequently ruled Mycenae for seven years.

Eight years later, Agamemnon's son, Orestes, and his daughter, [[Electra]], returned to Mycenae and killed both Clytemnestra, and Aegisthus.

[[Homer]], ''Od.'' iii. 263, iv. 517; [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fab.'' 87.

Much later, when Orestes was visiting [[Iphigenia]] in [[Crimea]], Aegisthus' son, [[Alete]], took over [[Mycenae]].  Orestes killed him upon his return.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Madaba map.jpg|thumb|150px|The Madaba Map depiction of sixth-century [[Jerusalem]] has the ''[[Cardo]] Maximus'', the town’s main street, beginning at the northern gate, today's [[Gates in Jerusalem's Old City Walls|Damascus Gate]], and traversing the city in a straight line from north to south to [[Nea Church]].]]

'''''Aelia Capitolina''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] in full: ''Colonia Aelia Capitolina'') was a city built by the emperor [[Hadrian]] in the year [[131]], and occupied by a [[Roman colony]], on the site of [[Jerusalem]], which was in ruins when he visited his dominion known as [[Syria Palæstina]].

&quot;Aelia&quot; came from Hadrian's ''[[Roman naming convention|nomen gentile]]'', ''[[Aelius]]'', while &quot;Capitolina&quot; meant that the new city was dedicated to ''[[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] [[Capitoline Hill|Capitolinus]]'', to whom a temple was built on the site of the [[Jewish temple]]. The establishment of ''Aelia Capitolina'' resulted in the failed [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] of [[132]]-[[135]].  Jews were forbidden to live in the city.  Roman enforcement of this prohibition continued through the fourth century. The city was without walls, protected by a light garrison of the Tenth legion, during the Late Roman Period. The detachment at [[Jerusalem]], which apparently encamped all over the city’s western hill, was responsible for preventing [[Jew]]s from returning to the city.

The urban plan of Aelia Capitolina was that of a typical [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town wherein main thoroughfares crisscrossed the [[Urban planning|urban grid]] lengthwise and widthwise. 

The original thoroughfare, flanked by rows of columns and shops, was about 73 feet wide (roughly the equivalent of a present-day six lane highway). The Hadrianic Cardo Maximus of Aelia terminated somewhere in the area of the present David Street.

The Latin name &quot;Aelia&quot; is the source of the Arabic term Iliya (إلياء), an early Islamic name for Jerusalem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aelian''' (Aelianus Tacticus) was a [[Hellenism|Greek]] [[military]] writer of the [[2nd century]] [[Anno domini|AD]], resident at [[Rome]]. He is sometimes confused with the Roman writer [[Claudius Aelianus]].

Aelian's military treatise, ''Taktike Theoria'', is dedicated to [[Hadrian]], though this is probably a mistake for [[Trajan]], and the date AD [[106]] has been assigned to it. It is a handbook of Greek, i.e. [[Macedon]]ian, [[parade (military)|drill]] and [[tactics]] as practised by the [[Hellenistic]] successors of [[Alexander the Great]]. The author claims to have consulted all the best authorities, the chief of which was a lost treatise on the subject by [[Polybius]]. Perhaps the chief value of Aelian's work lies in his critical account of preceding works on the art of [[war]], and in the fulness of his technical details in matters of drill.  

Critics of the [[18th century]]&amp;mdash;[[Guichard Folard]] and the [[Prince de Ligne]]&amp;mdash;were unanimous in thinking Aelian greatly inferior to [[Arrian]], but both on his immediate successors, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s, and later on the [[Arab]]s, (who translated the text for their own use), Aelian exercised a great influence. The emperor [[Leo VI]] incorporated much of Aelian's text in his own work on the military art.  The Arabic version of Aelian was made about [[1350]].  

In spite of its academic nature, the copious details to be found in the treatise rendered it of the highest value to the army organizers of the [[16th century]], who were engaged in fashioning a regular military system out of the semi-[[feudal]] systems of previous generations.  The [[Macedonian phalanx]] of Aelian had many points of resemblance to the solid masses of [[pikemen]] and the [[squadrons]] of [[cavalry]] of the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] systems, and the translations made in the 16th century formed the groundwork of numerous books on drill and tactics.  

Moreover, his works, with those of [[Xenophon]], Polybius, [[Aeneas Tacticus]] and Arrian, were minutely studied by every soldier of the 16th and [[17th century|17th centuries]] who wished to be master of his profession. It has been suggested that Aelian was the real author of most of Arrian's ''Tactica'', and that the ''Taktike Theoria'' is a later revision of this original, but the theory is not generally accepted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''agarose''' is a [[polysaccharide]] [[polymer]] material, generally extracted from [[seaweed]]. The molecules are extremely water-soluble due to their large number of [[hydroxyl]] groups, and the solutions tend to be low-melting point aqueous [[gel|gels]]. Sheets of agarose gels are readily prepared by pouring the warm, liquid solution into a mould, and are frequently used in [[molecular biology]] for the separation of large molecules by [[Agarose gel electrophoresis|electrophoresis]]. A wide range of different agaroses, of varying molecular weights and properties are commercially available for this purpose.

'''Atomic absorption spectroscopy''' in [[analytical chemistry]] is a technique for determining the concentration of a particular metal [[chemical element|element]] within a sample.  Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy can be used to analyse the concentration of over 62 different metals in a solution.

Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy was first developed during the 1950's by a team of Australian chemists, lead by [[Alan Walsh]], working at the [[CSIRO]] (Commonwealth Science and Industry Research Organisation) Division of Chemical Physics, in Melbourne Australia.  Typicaly, the technique makes use of a flame to atomize the sample, but other atomizers such as a graphite furnace are also used.  Three steps are involved in turning a liquid sample into an atomic gas:

#Desolvation &amp;#8211; the liquid [[solvent]] is [[evaporation|evaporated]], and the dry sample remains
#Vaporisation &amp;#8211; the solid sample vaporises to a gas
#Volatilisation &amp;#8211; the compounds making up the sample are broken into free [[atoms]].

The flame is arranged such that it is laterally long (usually 10cm) and not deep. The height of the flame must also be controlled by controlling the flow of the fuel mixture. A beam of [[light]] is focused through this flame at its longest axis (the lateral axis) onto a detector past the flame.  

The light that is focused into the flame is produced by a hollow cathode lamp.  Inside the lamp is a cylindrical metal cathode containing the metal for excitation, and an anode.  When a high voltage is applied across the anode and cathode, the metal atoms in the cathode are excited into producing light with a certain [[emission spectra]].  The type of hollow cathode tube depends on the metal being analysed.  For analysing the concentration of copper in an ore, a copper cathode tube would be used, and likewise for any other metal being analysed.  The [[electron]]s of the atoms in the flame can be promoted to higher orbitals for an instant by absorbing a set quantity of [[energy]] (a quantum). This amount of energy is specific to a particular electron transition in a particular element.  As the quantity of energy put into the flame is known, and the quantity remaining at the other side (at the detector) can be measured, it is possible to calculate how many of these transitions took place, and thus get a signal that is proportional to the concentration of the element being measured.

=== Fuel / oxidant mixtures ===

For a low temperature flame, [[acetylene]] and air is used. A hotter flame can be produced using acetylene and pure [[oxygen]], and an even hotter flame can be attained using [[nitrous oxide]] and acetylene, although this mixture is explosive.

[[Category:Spectroscopy]][[Category:Analytical chemistry]]

=== Background correction methods ===

The narrow linewidths of hollow cathode lamps make spectral overlap rare.  That is, it is unlikely that an absorption line from one element will overlap with another.  Molecular emission is much broader, so it is more likely that some molecular absorption band with overlap with an atomic line.  This can result in artificially high absorption and an improperly high calculation for the concentration in the solution.  Three methods are typically used to correct for this:
* Zeeman correction - A magnetic field is used to split the atomic line into two sidebands (see [[Zeeman effect]]).  These sidebands are close enough to the original wavelenth to still overlap with molecular bands, but are far enough not to overlap with the atomic bands.  The absorption in the presence and absence of a magnetic field can be compare, the difference being the atomic absorption or interest.
* Smith-Hieftje correction (invented by Stanley B. Smith and Gary M. Hieftje) - The hollow cathode lamp is pulsed with high current, causing a larger atom population and self-absorption during the pulses.  This self-absorption causes a broadening of the line and a reduction of the line intensity at the original wavelength.  
* Deuterium lamp correction - In this case, a separate source (a deuterium lamp) with broad emission is used to measure the backround emission.  The use of a separate lamp makes this method the least accurate, but its relative simplicity (and the fact that it is the oldest of the three) makes it the most commonly used method.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arthur St. Clair''' ([[March 23]], [[1734]]-[[1736]]?&amp;ndash;[[August 31]] [[1818]]) was the ninth [[President of the Continental Congress]] under the [[Articles of Confederation]], holding office from [[February 2]], [[1787]] to [[October 29]], [[1787]]. He was preceded in office by [[Nathaniel Gorham]] and succeeded by [[Cyrus Griffin]].  He was also a general in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolution]], and the only territorial governor of [[Ohio]].
[[Image:ArthurStClair.jpeg|left|Portrait of St. Clair]]
St. Clair was born [[Thurso]], [[Caithness]], [[Scotland]] on [[March 23]], sometime between [[1734]] and [[1736]].  He attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] and studied [[medicine]] under the renowned [[anatomy|anatomist]] [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]]. In [[1757]], St. Clair purchased a commission in the [[British Army]] and came to America with Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]]'s fleet for the [[French and Indian War]]. He served under General [[Jeffrey Amherst]] at the capture of [[Fortress Louisbourg|Louisburg, Nova Scotia]] on [[July 26]], [[1758]].  On [[April 17]], [[1759]] he received a lieutenant's commission and was assigned to the command of General [[James Wolfe]], under whom he served at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]].

On [[April 16]], [[1762]], he resigned his commission, and in [[1764]] he settled in Ligonier Valley, [[Pennsylvania]], where he purchased land, and erected mills. He was the largest landowner in western Pennsylvania.

In [[1770]] St. Clair became a justice of the court, of quarter sessions and of common pleas, a member of the proprietary council, a justice, recorder, and clerk of the orphans' court, and prothonotary of [[Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Bedford]] and [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]] counties.

In [[1774]], the colony of [[Virginia]] took claim of the area around [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and some residents of western Pennsylvania took up arms to reject them.  St. Clair issued an order for the arrest of the officer leading the Virginia troops. [[Lord Dunmore's War]] eventually settled the boundary dispute. 
==Revolutionary War==
After this event St. Clair broke with the British government and, in January, [[1776]], took a commission in the [[Continental Army]], as a Colonel of Pennsylvania militia ([[3rd Pennsylvania Regiment]]). He was appointed a Brigadier General in August of 1776, and was sent by [[George Washington]] to help organize the [[New Jersey]] militia.  He took part in Washington's crossing of the [[Delaware River]] on [[Christmas]] night [[1776]] before the [[Battle of Trenton]].  Many biographers credit St. Clair with the strategy which led to Washington's capture of [[Princeton, New Jersey]] in the following days.

In April of the same year, St. Clair was sent to defend [[Fort Ticonderoga]].  Unfortunately, his small garrison, could not resist [[John Burgoyne]]'s force in  the [[Saratoga Campaign]].  He was foced to withdraw at the [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1777)|Battle of Ticonderoga]] on [[July 5]], [[1777]]. He was able to withdraw his foces and continue resisting the advance. In [[1778]] he was court martialed for the loss of Ticonderoga. The court exonerated him, and he was returned to duty. St. Clair was at [[Yorktown, Virginia]] when [[Charles Cornwallis]] surrendered.

St. Clair was a member of the Pennsylvania council of censors in [[1783]] and was elected a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] from [[November 2]], [[1785]] until [[November 28]], [[1787]].  He was President of the United States in Congress assembled when [[Shays' Rebellion]] took place.

==Northwest Territory==
Under the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of [[1787]] which created the [[United States Northwest Territory|Northwest Territory]], General St. Clair was appointed governor of what is now [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], along with parts of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Minnesota]].  He named [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] after the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], and it was there that he made his seat. When the territory was divided in [[1800]], he served as governor of the [[Ohio Territory]].  

As Governor he formulated Maxwell's Code, the first laws of the territory.  He also sought to end Native American claims to Ohio land and clear the way for white settlement.  In [[1789]] he succeeded in getting certain Indians to sign the [[Treaty of Fort Harmar]], but many Native leaders had not been invited to participate in the negotiations, or had refused to do so.  Rather than settling the Indian's claims, the treaty provoked them to further resistance in what is sometimes known as the &quot;[[Northwest Indian War]]&quot; (or &quot;Little Turtle's War&quot;). Mutual hostilites led to a campaign by General [[Josiah Harmar]], whose 1,500 militiamen were defeated by the Indians in October [[1790]].

In [[1791]], St. Clair personally led a punitive expedition comprised of militia and two Regular Army regiments.  This force advanced to the location of Indian settlements on the [[Wabash River]], but on [[November 4]] they were routed in battle by a tribal confederation led by [[Miami tribe|Miami]] Chief [[Michikinikwa|Little Turtle]] and Shawnee chief [[Blue Jacket]]. More than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in the battle, called [[St. Clair's Defeat]], the &quot;Columbia Massacre,&quot; or the &quot;Battle of the Wabash.&quot; It was the greatest defeat of the American army by Native Americans in history. After this debacle, he resigned from the Army at the demand of President George Washington, but he continued to serve as Governor of the Northwest Territory.  

A [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]], he hoped to see two states made of the Ohio Territory in order to increase Federalist power in Congress. In [[1802]], his partisan opposition to plans for Ohio statehood led President Thomas Jefferson to remove him from office as territorial governor.  He thus played no part in the organizing of the state of Ohio in [[1803]].

St. Clair died in [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]] on [[August 31]], [[1818]], in poverty, his vast wealth dissipated by liberal gifts and loans, and by business reverses.

A portion of the ''Hermitage'', St. Clair's home in [[Youngstown, Pennsylvania]] was later moved to [[Ligonier, Pennsylvania]] where it is now preserved as a museum.   [[Upper St. Clair, Pennsylvania]], [[St. Clair County, Illinois]] and [[St. Clair County, Missouri]] are named in his honor.

'''Ajaccio''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Ajaccio''; [[Corsican language|Corsican]]: ''Aiacciu''), pronounced &quot;ah-YAH-cho&quot;, is a city ([[commune in France|commune]]) of [[France]]. It is the [[capital]] of the territorial collectivity of [[Corsica]] and the ''[[préfecture]]'' (capital) of the ''[[département in France|département]]'' of [[Corse-du-Sud]].

==Geography==

Ajaccio is located on the west coast of the island of Corsica, 210 m. southeast of [[Marseille]]. It occupies a sheltered position at the foot of wooded hills on the northern shore of the [[Gulf of Ajaccio]]. The harbour lies to the east of the town and is protected on the south by a [[peninsula]].

==History==

The present town of Ajaccio lies about two miles to the south of its original site, from which it was transferred by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] indf [[1492]]. Occupied from [[1553]] to [[1559]] by the French, it again fell to the Genoese after the [[Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis]] in the later year.  The town finally passed to the [[France|French]] in [[1768]].

==Sights==

The peninsula carries the [[citadel]] and terminates in the Citadel jetty. To the south-west of this peninsula lies the Place Bonaparte, a quarter frequented chiefly by winter visitors attracted by the mild climate of the town. Apart from one or two fine thoroughfares converging on the Place Bonaparte, the streets are mean and narrow and the town has a deserted appearance.

The house in which [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] was born in [[1769]] is preserved, and his associations with the town are everywhere emphasized by street-names and statues.

==Economy==

Ajaccio has a small manufacturing economy of [[cigar]]s, [[macaroni]], and similar products, and carries on [[shipbuilding]], [[sardine]]-fishing and [[coral]]-fishing. Its exports include timber, citrons, skins, chestnuts and gallic acid.

The port is accessible by the largest ships, but its accommodation is indifferent. In [[1904]] there entered 603 vessels with a tonnage of 202,980, and cleared 608 vessels with a tonnage of 202,502.

==Miscellaneous==

The town is the seat of a [[bishop|bishopric]] dating at least from the [[7th century]]. It has tribunals of first instance and of commerce, training colleges, a communal college, a museum and a library; the three latter are established in the Palais Fesch, founded by [[Cardinal Fesch]], who was born at Ajaccio in [[1763]].

Ajaccio was the birthplace of:
* [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] ([[1769]]–[[1821]]), Emperor of France
* [[Joseph Fesch]] (1763-[[1839]]), [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]
* [[Tino Rossi]] ([[1907]]-[[1983]]), singer, actor
* [[Fred Scamaroni]] ([[1914]]-[[1943]]), WW II Resistance hero
* [[Alizée]] (born [[1984]]), pop singer
* [[Irène Bordoni]] (1895-1953), singer, [[Broadway theatre]] &amp; [[film]] actress


The local football club is [[AC Ajaccio]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ajaigarh''', or '''Adjygurh''', is town in [[Panna District]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]] state in central [[India]].

==History==
Ajaigarh was the capital of a [[princely state]] of the same name in [[British India]]. Ajaigarh was founded in [[1765]] by Guman Singh, a [[Bundela]] [[Rajput]] who was the nephew of Raja Pahar Singh of [[Jaitpur]]. Ajaigarh was captured by the British in [[1809]], and became a princely state in the [[Bundelkhand]] Agency of the [[Central India Agency]]. It had an area of 771 mile&amp;sup2; (1997 km&amp;sup2;), and a population of 78,236 in [[1901]]. The rulers bore the title of ''sawai maharaja''. He commanded an estimated annual revenue of about £15,000/-, and paid a tribute of £460/-.  The chief resided at the town of [[Nowgong]], at the foot of the hill-fortress of Ajaigarh, from which the state took its name. This fort, situated on a steep hill, towers more than 800 ft (244 m) above the eponymous township, and contains the ruins of several temples adorned with elaborately carved sculptures. The town was often afflicted by [[malaria]], and suffered severely from famine in [[1868]]-[[1869]] and [[1896]]-[[1897]].

The state acceded to the [[Government of India]] on [[January 1]] [[1950]]; the ruling chief was granted a Privy purse of Rs. 74,700/-, and the courtesy use of his styles and titles. All of these were revoked by the government of [[India]] in [[1971]], at the time when these privileges were revoked from all erstwhile princes. The former princely state became part of the new Indian state of [[Vindhya Pradesh]], and most of the territory of the former state, including the town of Ajaigarh, became part of Panna District, with a smaller portion going to [[Chhatarpur District]]. Vindhya Pradesh was merged into Madhya Pradesh on [[November 1]] [[1956]].
