      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ásatrú''' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] &quot;[[Æsir]] faith&quot;) is a [[new religious movement]]  which is attempting to revive the pre-[[Christianization|Christian]] ([[Viking Age]]) [[Norse mythology|Nordic religion]] as described in the [[Edda|Eddas]]. 

Ásatrú was established in the [[1960s]] and early [[1970s]] in [[Iceland]], by the ''[[Íslenska Ásatrúarfélagið]]'' an organization founded by [[Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson]]. Ásatrú was recognized as an official religion by the governments of [[Iceland]] (in 1973), [[Denmark]] (in 2003) and [[Norway]]. The [[United States]] government does not officially endorse or recognize any religious group; however, numerous Ásatrú groups have been granted [[Non-profit corporation|nonprofit religious]] status going back to the [[1970s]].

While the term ''Ásatrú'' originally referred specifically to the Icelandic adherents of the religion, Germanic [[neopagan]] and [[reconstructionism|reconstructionist]] groups widely identify themselves as Ásatrú, particularly in the [[United States|USA]]. In this wider sense, the term ''Ásatrú'' is used synonymously with '''[[Germanic Neopaganism]]''' or  '''[[Germanic paganism|Germanic Paganism]]''', along with the terms '''Forn Sed''', '''Odinism''',  '''Heithni''', '''[[Heathenry]]''' and others.

==Terminology==
'''Ásatrú''' is an [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] term consisting of two parts. The first is ''Ása'' (genitive of [[Æsir|Áss]]) referring to one of two families of gods in the myths. The second part, trú, literally  means &quot;troth&quot; or &quot;faith&quot;.  Thus, Ásatrú means &quot;faith in the Æsir.&quot;  The term is the Old Norse/Icelandic translation of ''Asetro'', [[neologism]] coined in the context of  [[19th century]] [[romantic nationalism]], first used by [[Edvard Grieg]] in his [[1870]] opera ''[[Olaf Trygvason]]''.  The use of the term ''Ásatrú'' for Germanic paganism preceding 19th century revivalist movements is an anachronism. Likewise, use of ''Ásatrú'' as a synonym of Germanic Neopaganism, while widespread in the USA, can be misleading. Groups identifying themselves as Ásatrú cover a wide political spectrum, ranging from left-wing [[Environmental movement|environmentalist]] groups, [[New Age|New Agers]], [[universalism|universalists]], [[Neo-Tribalism|tribalists]], [[Polytheistic_reconstructionism|reconstructionists]], [[folkish|folkish groups]] and even [[neonazi]] (e.g. ''[[Artgemeinschaft]]'') movements. 

Members of the ''Íslenska Ásatrúarfélagið'' are somewhat unhappy with the semantic widening of the Icelandic term ''Ásatrú'', and would prefer its usage to specifically apply only to reconstructed medieval Norse paganism. 

''Ásatrúar'', sometimes used as a plural in English, is properly the [[genitive]] of Ásatrú.

==History==
'''Ásatrú''' originated as a second (or third) revival of Germanic paganism in the 1960s and early 1970s. The ''Íslenska Ásatrúarfélagið'' was founded on summer solstice, 1972,  and was recognized as an official religion by the Icelandic government in 1973, largely due to the efforts of Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson. At about this time, in the United States, [[Stephen McNallen]], a former [[U.S. Army]] [[Airborne_forces|Airborne]] [[U.S. Army Ranger|Ranger]], began publishing a newsletter titled ''The Runestone''. He also formed an organization called the ''Asatru Free Assembly'', later renamed the [[Ásatrú Folk Assembly]] which is still extant. [[Else Christensen|Else Christensen's]] ''Odinism'', which sometimes identified with the term ''Asatru'', originated around the same period. An offshoot of McNallen's group is the ''Asatru Alliance'', headed by Valgard Murray, publisher of the &quot;Vor Tru&quot; newsletter. The ''Asatru Alliance'' held its 25th annual &quot;[[Althing]]&quot; gathering in 2005.

==Politics==
'''Ásatrú''' organizations have memberships which span the entire political and spiritual spectrum. Many adherents are solitary practitioners who practice their religion alone with their family or a small local community, and are not involved with organized ''Ásatrú''. Despite the wide divergance of beliefs and politics, the sole common denominator amongst adherents of ''Ásatrú'' is the goal of reconstructing and practicing the historical pre-Christian religion of the [[Poetic Edda|Eddas]].

While ''Ásatrú'' is generally a tolerant religion, in the USA neo-nazis and advocates of [[white power]] are ostracized and shunned by most organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Matthias | last =Gardell | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =2003 | month = | title =Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | pages =269-283 | publisher =Duke University Press | location = | id =ISBN 0822330717 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three largest American ''Ásatrú'' organizations specifically have denounced association with racist groups.&lt;ref&gt;The positions of the AA, the AFA and the Troth:
:&lt;small&gt;'''From the ''Asatru Alliance's'' Bylaws:''' &quot;The Alliance is apolitical; it is not a front for, nor shall it promote any political views of the 'Right' or 'Left'. Our Sacred temples, groves and Moots shall remain free of any political manifestations.&quot;&lt;/small&gt; [http://asatru.org/bylaws.html]
:&lt;small&gt;'''From the ''Asatru Folk Assembly's'' Bylaws:''' &quot;The belief that spirituality and ancestral heritage are related has nothing to do with notions of superiority. Asatru is not an excuse to look down on, much less to hate, members of any other race. On the contrary, we recognize the uniqueness and the value of all the different pieces that make up the human mosaic.&quot;&lt;/small&gt; [http://runestone.org/flash/home.html]
:&lt;small&gt;'''From the ''Troth's'' Bylaws:''' &quot;Discrimination on the basis of race, gender, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation shall not be practiced by the Troth or any affiliated group, whether in membership decisions or in conducting any of its activities.&quot;&lt;/small&gt; [http://www.thetroth.org/organization/bylaws.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
There is actually an antagonistic relationship between many neo-nazis and the membership of most ''Ásatrú'' organizations in the USA, who view ''&quot;national socialism as an unwanted totalitarian philosophy incompatible with freedom-loving Norse paganism&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Gardell, p.276. Referring to Stephen McNallen, Valgard Murray and Edred Thorsson; the respective founders of the AFA, the AA and the Troth, which are the three largest Ásatrú groups in the USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term '''ansible''' is used in [[science fiction]] literature to describe a hypothetical [[superluminal communication|faster-than-light]] communication device.  It was coined by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] in her [[1966]] novel, ''[[Rocannon's World]]''. She derived the name from &quot;answerable&quot;, as the device would allow its users to receive answers to their messages in a reasonable amount of time, even over interstellar distances.  Her award-winning [[1974]] novel ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' tells of the invention of the ansible within her [[Ekumen]] milieu. 

The name and basic function of the device have since been borrowed by authors such as [[Frank Herbert]], [[Orson Scott Card]], [[Elizabeth Moon]], [[Vernor Vinge]], [[L.A. Graf]], [[Dan Simmons]], and [[Philip Pullman]] (though his was called a &quot;lodestone resonator&quot;).  Other science fiction stories have devices with similar effects that are not called ansibles; perhaps the best known is [[Star Trek]]'s &quot;subspace radio&quot;.  One ansible-like device which predates Le Guin's usage is the &quot;Dirac communicator&quot; in [[James Blish]]'s [[1954]] short story &quot;Beep&quot;.

Le Guin's ansible communicated instantaneously, and so do most other authors'.  A notable exception is the ansible in the Vinge short story &quot;The Blabber&quot;, which merely communicates faster than light &amp;mdash; in a universe where that is believed impossible.  

There is no known way to build an ansible.  While current theories of physics do not absolutely rule out the possibility, the theory of [[special relativity]] predicts that any such device would allow communication from the future to the past, which raises problems of [[causality]].  For this reason, most physicists believe that they will eventually be proven impossible.  [[Quantum entanglement]] is often proposed as a mechanism for superluminal communication, but our current understanding of that phenomenon is that it cannot be used for ''any'' sort of communication, superluminal or otherwise.  See [[time travel]] and [[faster-than-light]] for more discussion of these issues.

Orson Scott Card's [[Ender's Game series]] is probably the most widely read work to use an ansible (&quot;The official name is Philotic Parallax Instantaneous Communicator,&quot; explains Col. [[Hyrum Graff|Graff]] in ''[[Ender's Game]]'', &quot;but somebody dredged the name ''ansible'' out of an old book somewhere&quot;).  His description of ansible functions in ''[[Xenocide]]'' involve a fictional subatomic particle, the [[philote]], and contradicts not only standard physical theory but the results of empirical [[particle accelerator]] experiments.  In the &quot;Enderverse&quot;, the two [[quark]]s inside a [[pion|pi meson]] can be separated by an arbitrary distance while remaining connected by &quot;philotic rays&quot;.  In the real world, [[quark confinement]] prevents one from separating quarks by more than microscopic distances.  Most writers deliberately avoid explaining how their ansibles work; Card elaborated only because [[philotics]] became important to later volumes of the series.

'''''Ansible''''' is also a [[science fiction]] [[fanzine]] published by [[Dave Langford]], named after the faster-than-light communicator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Adalbert of Prague.jpg|thumb|right|Adalbert, part of the Wenceslas Monument on the [[Wenceslas Square]] in [[Prague]]]]

'''Adalbert''' ([[Czech language|Czech]]: {{Audio|Cs-svaty_Vojtech.ogg|''Vojtěch''}}, [[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Wojciech'', Germanic: ''Adalbert'') (c. [[956]] - [[April 23]], [[997]]) was a bishop of Prague who was martyred in his efforts to convert the Baltic Prussians.  He was later made the [[patron saint]] of [[Bohemia]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], and [[Prussia (province)|Prussia]].

== Birth and youth ==

Vojtěch was born of a noble family of prince [[Slavnik]] in [[Libice nad Cidlinou]], [[Bohemia]]. His father was a rich and independent ruler of [[Zlicans|Zličan]] princedom that rivaled Prague (see [[Slavník's dynasty]]). According to [[Cosmas of Prague|Cosmas']] chronicle, Slavnik was a happy man all his lifetime. Vojtěch had six brothers: Soběbor (Slavnik's heir), Spytimir, Pobraslav, Porej, Caslav and Radim (Gaudentius). The latter chose clerical path as well as Vojtěch did.

Vojtěch was a well-educated man. He studied for about ten years (970-80) in [[Magdeburg]] under Saint [[Adalbert of Magdeburg|Adalbert]]. When Adalbert died, Vojtěch took on the name Adalbert Vojtěch. His another preceptor was Otterich from st. Maurice school. Being gifted and industrious, Adalbert Vojtěch soon became well-known all over Europe.

== Religious acts ==
[[Image:Bishopcoa.png|170px|right]]
In 980 Adalbert finished his studies at Magdeburg school and returned to Prague where he became a priest.
In 981 his father, prince Slavnik, and both his mentors died.

In [[982]] Adalbert became the [[Bishop of Prague]]. However, he strongly resented the participation of formally Christian inhabitants in the [[slavery|slave]] trade. Although Adalbert descended from a rich family and could afford comfort and luxury, he lived poorly of his own free will. He was noted for charity, austerity, and zealous service to the Church. His duty was hard even in baptized Bohemia, as pagan creed was deeply embedded in peoples' mind. Adalbert complained of poligamy and idolatry that still were not unusual among the Czech.

In 989 he resigned from his bishop's cloth and leaved Prague. He went to Rome and lived as a hermit in st. Alexis benedictine monastery.

Four years later, in 993 the [[Pope]] sent him back to [[Bohemia]]. Adalbert became the Bishop again. That time he founded a monastery in Břevnov, near Prague. This was was the first monastery in Czechia. According to Cosmas' chronicle, high clerical office was a burden to Adalbert, and in 994 he offered it to [[Strachkvas]] who was Přemyslid and Duke Boleslav's brother. Strachkvas, nevertheless, rejected.

In 995 Slavniks' rivalry with Přemyslids resulted in a storm of Libice and a cruel murder of four (or five) Adalbert's brothers. All this was done by will of [[Boleslav II of Bohemia|Boleslav II]], and the key executors were his confederates from a powerful clan of Vrśovci. Thus Zličan princedom became part of Přemyslids' estate.

Adalbert damned Vrśovci in church and predicted that they would be severely persecuted. After the tragedy he could not stay in Bohemia any longer and escaped from Prague, despite the Pope's call for him to return to his episcopal see. Strachkvas was appointed to be his successor. However, when he was going to assume the Bishop office in Prague, he suddenly died during the ceremony itself. Circumstances of his death are still unclear.

As for Adalbert, he went to Hungary and baptized [[Geza of Hungary]] and his son [[Stephen of Hungary|Stephen]]. Then he went to Poland where he was cordially welcomed by [[Bolesław I the Brave]]. After the short visit Adalbert went to Prussia with a Christian mission.

== Mission and martyrdom in Prussia ==
[[Image:Adalb.jpg|right|frame|Saint-Adalbert is being killed by [[Prussians]], part of [[Gniezno Doors]]]]
Adalbert Vojtěch of [[Prague]] had already in [[977]] entertained the idea of becoming a [[missionary]] in [[Prussia (Baltic)|Prussia]]. After he had converted [[Hungary]], he was sent by the [[Pope]] to convert the heathen [[Prussia (Baltic)|Prussians]].  [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boleslaus the Brave]], duke of [[Poland]], sent [[soldiers]] with Adalbert. The bishop and his followers entered [[Prussia (Baltic)|Prussian]] territory near [[Gdańsk]] and went along the [[Baltic Sea]] coast.  

It was a standard procedure of Christian missionaries to try to chop down sacred oak trees (see [[Iconoclasm]]), which they had done in many other places, including [[Saxony]]. Because the trees were worshipped and the spirits who were believed to inhabit the trees were feared for their powers, this was done to demonstrate to the non-Christians that no supernatural powers protected the trees from the Christians.

When they did not heed warnings to stay away from the sacred oak groves, Adalbert was [[martyr|martyred]] in April [[997]] on the [[Baltic Sea]] coast near Truso (currently [[Elbląg]]). It is recorded that his body was bought back for its weight in [[gold]] by [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boleslaus the Brave]].

== Canonization and memory ==

A few years later Adalbert was [[canonization|canonized]] as '''Saint Adalbert of Prague.''' His life has been written about in ''Vita Sancti Adalberti'' by various writers, the earliest was traced to imperial [[Aachen]] and [[Liège (city)|Liège]], although it was assumed for many years that the [[Rome|Roman]] monk [[John Canaparius]] had written the first ''Vita'' in 999. Another famous biographer of Adalbert was st. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] who wrote his hagiography in 1001-1004.

Notably, Bohemian rulers (i.e. Přemyslids) initially refused to ransom st. Adalbert's body from Prussians who murdered him, so it was purchased by Poles. This fact may be explained by st. Adalbert's belonging to Slavniks family; it highlights two clans' conflict strength. Thus Saint Adalbert's bones were stored in [[Gniezno]] and helped [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boleslaus the Brave]] to improve Poland's position in Europe. 

There is an opinion that in 1039 [[Bohemia]]n duke [[Bretislav I]] retrieved the bones of Saint Adalbert from Gniezno and moved them to [[Prague]]. By other version, he took only part of bones, while rest of St. Adalbert's relics were hidden by Poles. Today Saint Adalbert has two graves, and which bones are authentic is still not clear. For example, the saint has two skulls - one in Prague, other in Gniezno (stolen in 1923).

In June, 1997 was a thousandth anniversary of st. Adalbert's martyrdom. It was commemorated in Poland, Germany, Czechia, Russia and other countries. Representatives of Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Evangelical churches pilgrimaged to Gniezno, to the saint's tomb. [[John Paul II]] visited Gniezno and held a ceremonial divine service which heads of seven European states and about a million of believers took part in. In [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], near Beregovoe village (former Tenkitten), where Adalbert's death hypothetically took place, a ten-meter cross was established.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Saint Alphege''' '''(Ælfheah)''' ([[954]] - [[April 19]] [[1012]]), [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], came of a noble family, but in early life gave up everything to devote himself to his faith.

Having assumed the monastic habit in the monastery of [[Deerhurst]], he passed thence to [[Bath]], where he became an anchorite and ultimately [[abbot]], distinguishing himself by his piety and the austerity of his life. In [[984]] he 
was appointed through [[Dunstan]]'s influence to the [[Bishop of Winchester|bishopric of Winchester]], and in 1006 he succeeded [[Aelfric]] as Archbishop of Canterbury.

At the sack of Canterbury by the [[Denmark|Danes]] in [[1011]] Ælfheah was captured and kept in prison for seven months. Refusing to pay a ransom, he was murdered at [[Greenwich, London]] on April 19, [[1012]] ([[St Alfege's Church]] reputedly marks the place he died). 

An account of his death appears in The [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;. . . for there was wine brought them from the south. Then took they the bishop . . . on the eve of the Sunday after Easter . . . They overwhelmed him with bones and horns of oxen; and one of them smote him with an axe-iron on the head; so that he sunk downwards with the blow; and his holy blood fell on the earth, whilst his sacred soul was sent to the realm of God.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Some sources record the final blow, with the back of an axe, being dealt by one 'Thrum' as an act of kindness by a Christian convert.

He was buried in [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]], whence his body was removed by [[Canute the Great|Canute]] to Canterbury with all the ceremony of a great act of state in [[1023]]. Alphege was canonised in [[1078]]. An incised paving slab to the north of the present High Altar of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] marks the place where the mediaeval shrine is believed to have stood.

===Dedications===
Dedications include: St. Alphege the Martyr, Canterbury (now used as an urban studies centre), [[St Alfege's Church]], Greenwich, the twin churches of St. Alphege Whitstable and St. Alphege Seasalter (chancel only surviving) and St Alphege in [[Solihull]], the main town of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Solihull]].

===Feast day===
Feast Day: April 19th.

==Accounts==
''Lives of St. Alphege'' in prose - which survives - and in verse were written by command of [[Lanfranc]] by the Canterbury monk [[Osborn]] (d. c. [[1090]]), who says that his account of the solemn translation to Canterbury in 1023 was received 
from the dean, Godric, one of Alphege's own scholars.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about a particular kind of [[vector space]]. For other uses of the term &quot;algebra&quot; see [[algebra (disambiguation)]].''
In [[mathematics]], an '''associative algebra''' is a [[vector space]] (or more generally, a [[module (mathematics)|module]]) which also allows the multiplication of vectors in a [[distributivity|distributive]] and [[associativity|associative]] manner. They are thus special [[algebra over a field|algebras]].

== Definition ==

An associative algebra ''A'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is defined to be a vector space over ''K'' together with a ''K''-[[bilinear operator|bilinear multiplication]] ''A'' x ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''A'' (where the image of (''x'',''y'') is written as ''xy'') such that the associative law holds:
* (''x y'') ''z'' = ''x'' (''y z'') for all ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' in ''A''. 
The bilinearity of the multiplication can be expressed as
* (''x'' + ''y'') ''z'' = ''x z'' + ''y z'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''A'',
* ''x'' (''y'' + ''z'') = ''x y'' + ''x z''  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''A'',
* ''a'' (''x y'') = (''a'' ''x'') ''y'' = ''x'' (''a'' ''y'') &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''A'' and ''a'' in ''K''.
If ''A'' contains an identity element, i.e. an element 1 such that 1''x'' = ''x''1 = ''x'' for all ''x'' in ''A'', then we call ''A'' an ''associative algebra with one'' or a '''[[unital]]''' (or '''unitary''') '''associative algebra'''.
Such an algebra is a [[ring (algebra)|ring]], and contains all elements ''a'' of the field ''K'' by identification with ''a''1.

The preceding definition generalizes without any change to an algebra over a [[commutative ring]] ''K'' (except that a ''K''-linear space is then called a [[module (mathematics)|module]] and not a vector space). See [[algebra (ring theory)]] for more.

The ''dimension'' of the associative algebra ''A'' over the field ''K'' is its [[Hamel dimension|dimension]] as a ''K''-vector space.

== Examples ==

* The square ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix_(mathematics)|matrices]] with entries from the field ''K'' form a unitary associative algebra over ''K''.
* The [[complex number|complex numbers]] form a 2-dimensional unitary associative algebra over the [[real number|real numbers]].
* The [[quaternions]] form a 4-dimensional unitary associative algebra over the reals (but not an algebra over the complex numbers, since complex numbers don't commute with quaternions).
* The [[polynomial|polynomials]] with real coefficients form a unitary associative algebra over the reals.
* Given any [[Banach space]] ''X'', the [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear operator|linear operators]] ''A'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X'' form a unitary associative algebra (using composition of operators as multiplication); this is in fact a [[Banach algebra]].
* Given any [[topology|topological space]] ''X'', the continuous real- (or complex-) valued functions on ''X'' form a real (or complex) unitary associative algebra; here we add and multiply functions pointwise.
* An example of a non-unitary associative algebra is given by the set of all functions ''f'': '''R''' &amp;rarr; '''R''' whose [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] as ''x'' nears infinity is zero. 
* The [[Clifford algebra]]s are useful in [[geometry]] and [[physics]].
* [[Incidence algebra]]s of locally finite [[partially ordered set]]s are unitary associative algebras considered in [[combinatorics]].

== Algebra homomorphisms ==

If ''A'' and ''B'' are associative algebras over the same field ''K'', an ''algebra homomorphism'' ''h'': ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' is a ''K''-[[linear transformation|linear map]] which is also multiplicative in the sense that ''h''(''xy'') = ''h''(''x'') ''h''(''y'') for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''A''. With this notion of morphism, the class of all associative algebras over ''K'' becomes a [[category theory|category]].

Take for example the algebra ''A'' of all real-valued continuous functions '''R''' &amp;rarr; '''R''', and ''B'' = '''R'''. Both are algebras over '''R''', and the map which assigns to every continuous function ''f'' the number ''f''(0) is an algebra homomorphism from ''A'' to ''B''.

== Index-free notation ==
In the above definition of an associative algebra, the definition of associativity was made with regard to all of the elements of ''A''. It is sometimes more convenient to have a definition of associativity that does not need to refer to the elements of ''A''.
This can be done as follows. An algebra is defined as a map ''M'' (multiplication) on a vector space ''A'':
:&lt;math&gt;M: A \times A \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;
An associative algebra is an algebra where the map ''M'' has the property
:&lt;math&gt;M \circ (\mbox {Id} \times M) = M \circ (M \times \mbox {Id})&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the symbol &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; refers to functional composition, and Id is the identity map: &lt;math&gt;Id(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' in ''A''.  To see the equivalence of the definitions, we need only understand that each side of the above equation is a function that takes three arguments. For example, the left-hand side acts as
:&lt;math&gt;( M \circ (\mbox {Id} \times M)) (x,y,z) = M (x, M(y,z))&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, a unital associative algebra can be defined in terms of a unit map
:&lt;math&gt;\eta: K \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;
which has the property
:&lt;math&gt;M \circ (\mbox {Id} \times \eta ) = s = M \circ (\eta \times \mbox {Id})&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the unit map &amp;eta; takes an element ''k'' in ''K'' to the element ''k1'' in ''A'', where ''1'' is the unit element of ''A''.  The map ''s'' is just plain-old scalar multiplication: &lt;math&gt;s:K\times A \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;; thus, the above identity is sometimes written with Id standing in the place of ''s'', with scalar multiplication being implicitly understood.

== Generalizations ==

One may consider associative algebras over a commutative ring ''R'': these are [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over ''R'' together with a ''R''-bilinear map which yields an associative multiplication. In this case, a unital ''R''-algebra ''A'' can equivalently be defined as a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] ''A'' with a ring homomorphism ''R''&amp;rarr;''A''.

The ''n''-by-''n'' matrices with [[integer]] entries form an associative algebra over the integers and the polynomials with coefficients in the ring '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' (see [[modular arithmetic]]) form an associative algebra over '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''.

== Coalgebras == 

An associative unitary algebra over ''K'' is based on a [[morphism]] ''A''&amp;times;''A''&amp;rarr;''A'' having 2 inputs (multiplicator and multiplicand) and one output (product), as well as a morphism ''K''&amp;rarr;''A'' identifying the scalar multiples of the multiplicative identity. These two morphisms can be dualized using [[categorial duality]] by reversing all arrows in the [[commutative diagram]]s which describe the algebra [[axiom|axioms]]; this defines the structure of a [[coalgebra]].

There is also an abstract notion of [[F-coalgebra]].

== Representations == 
A [[group representation|representation]] of an algebra is a linear map &lt;math&gt;\rho:A\rightarrow gl(V)&lt;/math&gt; from ''A'' to the general linear algebra of some vector space (or module) ''V'' that preserves the multiplicative operation: that is, &lt;math&gt;\rho(xy)=\rho(x)\rho(y)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Note, however, that there is no natural way of defining a [[tensor product]] of representations of associative algebras, without somehow imposing additional conditions.   Here, by ''tensor product of representations'',  the usual meaning is intended: the result should be a linear representation on the product vector space.
Imposing such additional structure typically leads to the idea of a [[Hopf algebra]] or a [[Lie algebra]], as demonstrated below.

===Motivation for a Hopf algebra===
Consider, for example, two representations &lt;math&gt;\sigma:A\rightarrow gl(V)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau:A\rightarrow gl(W)&lt;/math&gt;.  One might try to form a tensor product representation &lt;math&gt;\rho: x \mapsto \rho(x) = \sigma(x) \otimes \tau(x)&lt;/math&gt; according to how it acts on the product vector space, so that 

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x)(v \otimes w) = (\sigma(x)(v)) \otimes (\tau(x)(w))&lt;/math&gt;. 

However, such a map would not be linear, since one would have 

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(kx) = \sigma(kx) \otimes \tau(kx) = k\sigma(x) \otimes k\tau(x) = k^2 (\sigma(x) \otimes \tau(x)) = k^2 \rho(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;k \in  K&lt;/math&gt;. One can rescue this attempt and restore linearity by imposing additional structure, by defining a map &lt;math&gt;\Delta:A \rightarrow A \times A&lt;/math&gt;, and defining the tensor product representation as 
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = (\sigma\otimes \tau) \circ \Delta&lt;/math&gt;. 
Here, &amp;Delta; is a [[comultiplication]].  The resulting structure is called a [[bialgebra]].  To be consistent with the definitions of the associative algebra, the coalgebra must be co-associative, and, if the algebra is unital, then the co-algebra must be unital as well.  Note that bialgebras leave  multiplication and co-multiplication unrelated; thus it is common to relate the two (by defining an antipode), thus creating a [[Hopf algebra]].

===Motivation for a Lie algebra ===
One can try to be more clever in defining a tensor product. Consider, for example,
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto \rho (x) = \sigma(x) \otimes \mbox{Id}_W + \mbox{Id}_V \otimes \tau(x)&lt;/math&gt; 
so that the action on the tensor product space is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x) (v \otimes w) = (\sigma(x) v)\otimes w + v \otimes (\tau(x) w)&lt;/math&gt;. 
This map is clearly linear in ''x'', and so it does not have the problem of the earlier definition.  However, it fails to preserve multiplication:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(xy) = \sigma(x) \sigma(y) \otimes \mbox{Id}_W + \mbox{Id}_V \otimes \tau(x) \tau(y)&lt;/math&gt;.
But, in general, this does not equal
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x)\rho(y) = 
\sigma(x) \sigma(y) \otimes \mbox{Id}_W + 
\sigma(x) \otimes \tau(y) +
\sigma(y) \otimes \tau(x) +
\mbox{Id}_V \otimes \tau(x) \tau(y)&lt;/math&gt;.
Equality would hold if the product ''xy'' were antisymmetric (if the product were the [[Lie bracket]], that is, &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv M(x,y) = [x,y]&lt;/math&gt;), thus turning the associative algebra into a [[Lie algebra]].

      <comment>/* Elementary implications */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''axiom of regularity''' (also known as the '''axiom of foundation''') is one of the axioms of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]].  In [[first-order logic]] the axiom reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A: A \neq \{\} \implies \exists B: B \in A \land \lnot \exist C: C \in A \land C \in B&lt;/math&gt;
Or in prose:
:Every non-empty [[set]] ''A'' contains an element ''B'' which is disjoint from ''A''. 

Two results which follow from the axiom are that &quot;no set is an element of itself&quot;, and that &quot;there is no infinite [[sequence]] (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') such that ''a&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an element of ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all ''i''&quot;.

With the [[axiom of choice]], this result can be reversed: if there are no such infinite sequences, then the axiom of regularity is true. Hence the two statements are equivalent.

The axiom of regularity is arguably the least useful ingredient of  [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]], since virtually all results in the branches of mathematics based on set theory hold even in the absence of regularity.  In addition to omitting the axiom of regularity, non-standard set theories have indeed postulated the existence of sets that are elements of themselves.  See [[Axiomatic set theory#Well-foundedness and hypersets|&quot;Well-foundedness and hypersets&quot;]] in the article [[Axiomatic set theory]].

== Elementary implications ==

''Axiom of regularity implies that no set is an element of itself''

Let ''A'' be a set such that ''A'' is an element of itself and define ''B'' = {''A''}, which is a set by the [[axiom of pairing]]. Applying the axiom of regularity to ''B'', we see that the only element of ''B'', namely, ''A'', must be disjoint from ''B''. But the intersection of ''A'' and ''B'' is just ''A''. Thus ''B'' does not satisfy the axiom of regularity and we have a contradiction, proving that ''A'' cannot exist.

''Axiom of regularity implies that no infinite descending sequence of sets exists''

Let ''f'' be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the natural numbers with ''f''(''n''+1) an element of ''f''(''n'') for each ''n''. Define ''S'' = {''f''(''n''): ''n'' a natural number}, the range of ''f'', which can be seen to be a set from the formal definition of a function. Applying the axiom of regularity to ''S'', let ''f''(''k'') be an element of ''S'' which is disjoint from ''S''. But by the definitions of ''f'' and ''S'', ''f''(''k'') and ''S'' have an element in common (namely ''f''(''k''+1)). This is a contradiction, hence no such ''f'' exists.

''Assuming the axiom of choice, no infinite descending sequence of sets implies the axiom of regularity''

Let the non-empty set ''S'' be a counter-example to the axiom of regularity; that is, every element of ''S'' has a non-empty intersection with ''S''. Let ''g'' be a [[Axiom of choice|choice function]] for ''S'', that is, a map such that ''g''(''s'') is an element of ''s'' for each non-empty subset ''s'' of ''S''. Now define the function ''f'' on the non-negative integers recursively as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;f(0) = g(S)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(n+1) = g(f(n) \cap S).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then for each ''n'', ''f''(''n'') is an element of ''S'' and so its intersection with ''S'' is non-empty, so ''f''(''n''+1) is well-defined and is an element of ''f''(''n''). So ''f'' is an infinite descending chain. This is a contradiction, hence no such ''S'' exists.

== Common misconception: Russell's paradox and the axiom of regularity ==

[[Russell's paradox]] is the [[paradox]] whereby consideration of &quot;the set
of all sets that do not contain themselves as members&quot; leads to a contradiction
in [[naive set theory]].  Since the axiom of regularity implies that no set contains
itself as a member, it can be tempting for the non-expert to think that the
presence of the axiom of regularity in [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF) has
something to do with the way in which ZF
resolves Russell's paradox.  (For example, this misconception is perpetuated in
[[David Foster Wallace]]'s ''[[Everything and More]]''.)  In fact, the contradiction
of Russell's paradox is avoided because the
[[axiom schema of specification|separation axioms]] in ZF are of limited power (as
compared with naive set theory).  Indeed, a contradiction can only be eliminated from
a theory by
weakening or removing axioms;
adding the axiom of regularity (or any other axiom) to a theory
only makes it ''more'' likely that a contradiction will be encountered.
The axiom of regularity is irrelevant to the resolution of Russell's paradox.

'''AIX''' ('''Advanced Interactive eXecutive''') is a [[proprietary]] [[operating system]] developed by [[IBM]] based on [[UNIX System V]]. Before the product was ever marketed, the [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] ''AIX'' originally stood for '''Advanced IBM Unix'''.

AIX has pioneered numerous [[network operating system]] enhancements, introducing new innovations later adopted by [[Unix-like]] operating systems; it is often one of the first operating systems to implement a new innovation in [[software architecture]] as a sophisticated software technology.

The [[Scalability|scalable]] AIX 5L 5.3 supports up to 64 [[central processing unit]]s and two [[terabyte]]s (TB) of [[random access memory]]. The [[JFS#History|JFS2]] [[file system]]&amp;mdash;first introduced by IBM as part of AIX&amp;mdash;supports [[computer file]]s and [[Partition (computing)|partition]]s up to 16 TB in size.

==Development==
AIX V1, introduced in 1986, was based on [[System V]] Release 3. IBM later ported AIX to the [[RS/6000]] platform as '''AIX/6000'''; since [[1989]], AIX has served as the RS/6000's primary operating system. In developing AIX, IBM and [[Interactive Systems Corporation|INTERACTIVE Systems Corporation]] (whom IBM contracted) also incorporated source code from [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] 4.2 and 4.3.

In the [[SCO v. IBM]] [[lawsuit]] filed in 2003, the [[SCO Group]] alleged that (among other infractions) IBM misappropriated licensed [[source code]] from [[UNIX System V]] Release 4 for incorporation into AIX. IBM maintains that their license was irrevocable.

==Supported architectures==
* AIX v1 supported IBM [[PS/2]] [[Micro Channel architecture]] PCs and the [[IBM RT]].
* AIX v2 supported 6150-series IBM RT systems.
* AIX v3 introduced support for the [[IBM POWER]] architecture.
* AIX v4 introduced support for the [[PowerPC]] architecture and the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus.
* AIX v5 introduced support for the [[IA64]] architecture.
* AIX v5.1 was the last version to support the [[Micro Channel architecture]].

===AIX on IBM Mainframes===
In 1988, IBM announced AIX/370. AIX/370 was IBM's first attempt to offer Unix-like functionality for their mainframe line, specifically the [[System/370]]. AIX/370 was released in 1990 with functional equivalence to System V Release 2 and 4.3BSD as well as IBM enhancements. With the introduction of the [[ESA/390]] architecture, AIX/370 was rebranded as AIX/ESA in 1991 and ran on the [[System/390]] platform. Unlike AIX on its other platforms, AIX on the mainframe never ran as the host operating system, but rather as a guest under [[VM (Operating system)|VM]]. AIX on the mainframe had little success and UNIX functionality was instead added as an option with the existing mainframe operating system, [[MVS]], which became [[MVS/ESA|MVS/ESA OpenEdition]] in 1993.

==Interfaces==
===Graphical===
The [[Common Desktop Environment]] (CDE) is AIX's default [[graphical user interface]]. As part of Linux Affinity and the free AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications (ATLA), open-source [[KDE]] and [[GNOME]] desktop are also available.

===Text-based console===
[[SMIT]], also known as smitty, is a text based System Management Interface Tool for AIX. It allows a user to navigate a menu hierarchy of commands, rather than using the command line. Experienced system administrators make use of the F6 command which generates the command line needed for complex tasks.

SMIT and smitty are the same program, however smitty is the text-based version, and SMIT is a graphical version which runs under the X Window System. If you are on a text based terminal, running the smit program will invoke the text-based version.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:The_Apple_II.jpg|thumb|400px|The 1977 Apple II, complete with integrated keyboard, color high-resolution graphics, sound, a sleek plastic case, and eight expansion slots.]] The '''Apple II''' was the first [[microcomputer]] manufactured by [[Apple Computer]]. Its direct ancestor was the [[Apple I]], a circuit board computer for hobbyists that was never produced in quantity but which pioneeered many of the features that made the Apple II a success. Introduced at the [[West Coast Computer Faire]] in 1977, the Apple II was one of the very first (and most successful) [[personal computers]]. A number of different models were sold, and the most popular model was manufactured, with relatively minor changes, into the 1990s.

Unlike any other machine before it, the Apple II looked more like an appliance than a piece of electronic test equipment. This was a computer that would not seem out of place in the home, on a manager's desk, or in a classroom. The lid popped easily off the sleek beige plastic case, allowing access to the entire motherboard and inviting users to look inside and tinker with the computer's eight expansion slots and its bounty of empty RAM sockets, which could hold up to 48 kilobytes of memory.

Also unique for its time were the machine's color and high-resolution graphics modes (which could be used on an ordinary television), its sound capbilities, and its built-in BASIC programming language. Compared to earlier machines, these features were well-documented and easy to learn. The Apple II thus marked the beginning of the personal computer revolution: it was a machine for the masses, not just hobbyists, scientists, and engineers. The Apple II's influence was widespread; most of the machines that followed imitated many aspects of the successful machine.

Throughout the 1980s and much of the 1990s, the Apple II was the ''de facto'' standard computer in [[United States|American]] [[K-12]] schools and even some colleges and universities. Some of these machines are still operational in classrooms today. The Apple II was popular with business users as well as with families and schools, particularly after the release of the first-ever computer [[spreadsheet]], ''[[VisiCalc]]'', which initially ran only on the Apple II.

See the [[computing timeline]] for dates of Apple II family model releases &amp;ndash; the 1977 Apple II and its younger siblings, the II Plus, [[Apple IIe|IIe]], [[Apple IIc|IIc]], [[Apple IIc Plus|IIc Plus]] and [[Apple IIgs|II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;]].

== History ==
=== The original Apple II ===
The first Apple II computers went on sale on [[June 5]], [[1977]] with a [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] microprocessor running at 1 MHz, 4 [[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], an [[compact audio cassette|audio cassette]] interface for loading programs and storing data, and the [[Integer BASIC]] programming language built into the [[Read-only memory|ROMs]]. The video controller displayed 24 lines by 40 columns of upper-case-only text on the screen, with [[NTSC]] [[composite video]] output suitable for display on a monitor, or on a TV set by way of an [[RF modulator]]. The original retail price of the computer was $1298 with 4KB of RAM and $2638 with 48KB of RAM, the maximum amount of memory supported on the original motherboard.

To reflect the machine's then-unique color graphics capability, the Apple logo on the computer's case was made up of rainbow stripes, and these remained a part of the logo until early 2000.

Later, an external 5&amp;frac14;-inch [[floppy disk]] drive, the '''Disk II''',  attached via a controller card that plugged into one of the computer's expansion slots (usually slot 6), gave users much more convenient data storage and retrieval. The Disk II interface, created by [[Steve Wozniak]] (&quot;Woz&quot;), is still regarded as an engineering masterpiece. Where other controllers had dozens of chips for synchronizing data I/O with disk rotation, seeking the head to the appropriate track, and encoding the data into magnetic pulses, Woz's controller card had few chips; instead, the Apple DOS used software to perform these functions. The [[Group Code Recording]] used by the controller was simpler and easier to implement in software than the more common [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]]. According to legend, Woz laid out the circuit board several times as he realized that moving one more function to software would allow him to remove yet another chip. In the end, the low chip count of the controller contributed to making Apple's Disk II the first affordable floppy drive system for personal computers. As a side effect, Woz's scheme also made it easy for [[proprietary software]] developers to [[copy protection|copy-protect]] the media on which their software shipped by changing the low-level sector format or stepping the drive's head between the tracks; naturally, other companies eventually sold software to foil such protection.

The approach taken in the Disk II controller was typical of Woz's design sensibility. The Apple II is full of clever engineering tricks to save hardware and reduce costs. For example, by interleaving the video generation circuitry's memory access with the CPU's, a feature unique to the 6502, Woz eliminated the need for a separate refresh circuit for the DRAM chips. Rather than using a complex analog-to-digital circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Woz used a simple timer circuit whose period was proportional to the resistance of the game controller, then used a software loop to measure the timer. The text and graphics screens had a frankly Byzantine arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which reputedly was due to Woz's realization that doing it that way would save a chip; it was less expensive to have software calculate or look up the address of the needed scanline than to include the extra hardware. 

The epitome of the Apple II design philosophy was the Apple II sound circuitry. Rather than having a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II had a toggle circuit that could only emit a click through a built-in speaker; all other sounds (including two, three, and eventually four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) were generated entirely by clever software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Not for nearly a decade would an Apple II be released with a dedicated sound chip. Similar techniques were used for cassette storage; the cassette output worked the same as the speaker, and the input was a simple zero-crossing detector that served as a very crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM were used to encode and decode data in [[frequency shift keying]] for the cassette. These brilliant quirks served as a gauntlet that drew scores of equally quirky and brilliant programmers to the platform, and these became the Apple II's lifeblood. 

Wozniak's open design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices to expand the capabilities of the machine.  Serial controllers, improved display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, and networking components were available for this system in its day.  There were also emulator cards, such as the Z80 card which permitted the Apple to switch to the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor and run a multitude of programs developed under the [[CPM operating system|CP/M operating system]], including the [[DBASE|dBase II]] database and the [[WordStar]] word processor. There was also a third-party [[Motorola 6809|6809]] card with which one could run [[OS-9]] Level One. The [[Mockingboard]] sound card greatly improved the audio capabilities of the Apple with simple music synthesis and text to speech.  Eventually ''accelerator boards'' were  created to double or quadruple the computer's speed.

==The family grows==
===Apple II Plus===
[[Image:Apple_II_Plus.jpg|thumb|right|375px|The Apple II Plus with a pair of Disk II drives. The Disk II was the first microcomputer floppy drive.]] 
The Apple II was eventually superseded by the '''Apple II Plus''', which included the [[Applesoft BASIC]] programming language in ROM. This Microsoft-authored dialect of BASIC, which was previously available as an upgrade, supported floating-point arithmetic (albeit at a slower speed than Steve Wozniak's Integer BASIC) and became the standard BASIC dialect on the Apple. 

The Apple II Plus had a total of 48 kilobytes of RAM, expandable to 64 KB by means of the ''language card,'' an expansion card that could be installed in the computer's slot 0. The Apple's 6502 microprocessor could support a maximum of 64 KB of memory, and a machine with 48 KB RAM reached this limit because of the additional 16 KB of read-only memory and I/O addresses. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was bank-switched over the machine's built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft dialects of BASIC with DOS 3.3's INT and FP commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card. The language card was also required to use the [[UCSD Pascal]] and [[FORTRAN|FORTRAN 77]] compilers, which were released by Apple at about the same time. These ran under a non-DOS operating system called the UCSD P-System, which had its own disk format and included a &quot;virtual machine&quot; that allowed it to run on many different types of hardware.

Like the Apple II, the Apple II Plus had no [[lowercase]] functionality. All letter keys on the keyboard would type uppercase letters, and there were no lowercase letters in the text-mode [[font]] stored in the computer's [[Read-Only Memory|ROM]]. (Note the lack of a [[caps lock]] key on the keyboard.) To display lowercase letters, some applications would run in the slower ''hi-res graphics mode'' and use a custom font, rather than running in the fast ''text mode'' using the font in ROM. Alternatively, users could install a custom ROM chip that contained lowercase letters in the font; or purchase an ''80-column card'' that enabled a text mode that could display 80-column, upper- and lower-case text. For lowercase input, since it was not possible to detect whether the keyboard's Shift keys were in use, a modification called the &quot;one-wire shift key mod&quot; wired the Shift keys to one of the pins on the motherboard's joystick connector. Compatible applications, including nearly all [[word processor]]s, could then detect whether the Shift key was being pressed. This modification, however, involved [[soldering]], and was therefore only popular among hobbyists.

===Apple IIe===
[[Image:290px-Apple IIe middle age.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A typical Apple IIe system. Seen here with DuoDisk 5&amp;frac14;&quot; floppy drive unit that sat sandwiched between case and monitor.]] 
The Apple II Plus was followed in 1983 by the '''[[Apple IIe]]''', a cost-reduced yet more powerful machine that used newer chips to reduce the component count and add new features, such as the display of upper and lowercase letters and a standard 64 KB of RAM. The IIe RAM was configured as if it were a 48K Apple II Plus with a language card; the machine had no slot 0, but instead had an auxiliary slot that for all practical purposes took the place of slot 3. The auxiliary slot could accept a 1K memory card to enable the 80-column display (the card contained only RAM; the hardware and firmware for the 80-column display was built into the Apple IIe). An &quot;extended 80-column card&quot; with more memory expanded the machine's RAM to 128 KB. As with the language card, the memory in the 80-column card was bank-switched over the machine's main RAM; this made the memory better suited to data storage than to running software, and in fact the [[ProDOS]] operating system, which was introduced with the Apple IIe, would automatically configure this memory as a [[RAM disk]] upon booting. Third-party aux-slot memory cards later allowed expansion up to 1 MB. The extended 80-column card also enabled two new graphics modes, Double Hi-Res and Double Lo-Res, which doubled the horizontal resolution and, in the case of Double Hi-Res, doubled the number of available colors as well over the standard hi-res mode.

Introduced with the IIe was the DuoDisk, essentially two Disk II 5&amp;frac14;&quot; drives in a single enclosure designed to stack between the computer and the monitor, and a new controller card to run it. This controller was functionally identical to the original Disk II controller but used a different connector, allowing a single cable to control both drives in the DuoDisk.

The IIe was the most popular Apple II ever built and was widely considered the &quot;workhorse&quot; of the line. It also has the distinction of being the longest-lived Apple computer of all time -- it was manufactured and sold with only minor changes for nearly eleven years. In that time, following the original, two important variations came to pass known as the [[Apple IIe#The Enhanced IIe|Enhanced IIe]] (four new replacement chips to give it the same features as the later model [[Apple IIc|Apple IIc]]) and [[Apple IIe#The Platinum IIe| Platinum IIe]] (a modernized new look for the case color to match other Apple products of the era, along with the addition of a built-in numeric keypad).

Two and a half years before the Apple IIe, Apple had produced and marketed a computer called the ''[[Apple III]]'' for business users. This product was not a success, and Steve Wozniak has been quoted as saying that the Apple III had a 100% failure rate -- every single machine manufactured had some kind of fault. Many of its features were carried over in the design of the Apple IIe, though, including the ProDOS operating system, which was based on Apple III SOS.

===Apple IIc===
[[Image:Apple_IIc.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Apple IIc was Apple's first compact and portable computer. Pictured here with a very early and extremely rare [[LCD]] display.]] 
Apple released the '''[[Apple IIc]]''' in April 1984, billing it as a portable Apple II. (By portable it was meant that the computer could be easily carried from place to place; lacking battery power and a built-in display, it was not a true portable as the term is used today.) The IIc even sported a carrying handle that folded down to prop the machine up in a typing position. It was the first of three Apple II models to be made in the [[Snow White design language]] -- and the only one that was actually white. (The other machines, the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; and the IIc Plus, were actually light gray, or as Apple had it, &quot;platinum.&quot;)

The Apple IIc was the first Apple II to use the updated [[65C02 Microprocessor|65C02]] processor, and featured a built-in floppy drive and 128K RAM, with a built-in disk controller that could control external drives, composite video (NTSC or PAL), serial interfaces for modem and printer, and a joystick/mouse port. Unlike previous Apple II models, the IIc had no internal expansion slots at all, this being the means by which its compact size was attained. Third parties did eventually figure out how to wedge up to 1 MB of additional memory and a real-time clock into the machine, and a later revision of the motherboard provided an expansion slot that could accept an Apple memory card bearing up to 1 megabyte of RAM. The disk port, originally intended for a second 5&amp;frac14;&quot; floppy drive, eventually was able to interface to 3&amp;frac12;&quot; disk drives and (via third parties) even hard disks.

To play up the portability, two different monochrome [[LCD]] displays were sold for use with the IIc's video expansion port, although both were short-lived due to high cost and poor legibility. (A IIc with the smaller of these displays appeared briefly in the film [[2010: The Year We Make Contact|2010]].) The IIc had an external power supply that converted AC power to 12V DC, allowing third parties to offer battery packs and automobile power adapters that connected in place of the supplied AC adapter.

The Apple IIc was the first microcomputer to include support for the [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard]], which was activated using a switch above the keyboard. This feature was also later found in late-model Apple IIe computers (though the switch was inside the computer) and in the Apple IIgs (accessible via the built-in control panel).

===Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;===
[[image:Apple_IIGS.jpg|right|frame|px300|The Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;, the most powerful Apple II, featuring a true 16-bit CPU, 4096 colors, Ensoniq synthesizer, a Mac-like GUI -- and a mouse]]
The next member of the line was the '''[[Apple IIgs|Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;]]''' computer, released in 1986. A radical departure from the existing Apple II line, the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; featured a true [[16-bit]] microprocessor, the [[65816 Microprocessor|65C816]], operating at 2.8 MHz with 24-bit addressing, allowing expansion up to 8 MB of RAM without the bank-switching hassles of the earlier machines. It introduced two completely new graphic modes sporting higher resolutions and a palette of 4,096 colors; however, only 4, 16, or 256 colors could be used at a time, depending on the mode and other restrictions. 

In a welcome departure from earlier Apple II graphics modes, the new modes laid out the scanlines sequentially in memory. However, programmers in search of a graphics challenge could always turn to 3200-color mode, which involved precisely swapping out the color palettes as the monitor's electron beam traced the screen, allowing up to sixteen different colors for each of 200 scanlines. This technique did not leave many CPU cycles available for other processing, so this &quot;mode&quot; was best suited to displaying static images.

The Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; stood out from any previous (or future) Apple II models, evolving and advancing the platform into the next generation of computing while still maintaining near-complete backward compatibility. The secret of the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;'s compatibility was a single chip called the Mega II, which contained the functional equivalent of an entire Apple IIe computer (sans processor), which, combined with the flawless 65C02 emulation mode of the 65C816 processor, provided full support for legacy software.

The computer also included a 32-voice [[Ensoniq]] [[wavetable]] music synthesizer with 64K dedicated RAM, 256K of standard RAM, built-in peripheral ports (switchable between IIe-style card slots and IIc-style onboard controllers for disk drives, mouse, RGB video, and serial devices), built-in [[AppleTalk]] networking, and a ROM toolbox that supported a graphical user interface derived from the Macintosh toolbox. The computer could run existing 8-bit Apple II software (including software written for the very first Apple II in Integer BASIC), but also supported 16-bit software running under a new OS first called ProDOS 16 and later called GS/OS. The new OS eventually included a Finder that could be used for managing disks and files and opening documents and applications, along with desk accessories -- just like the Macintosh. The 16-bit operating system would automatically switch to the text display and downshift to 8-bit mode to run legacy software, while offering a consistent, Macintosh-like graphical interface for native 16-bit applications. Eventually the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; gained the ability to read and write Macintosh disks and, through third-party software, even multitasking (both cooperative and preemptive, the latter in the form of a Unix-type shell), outline TrueType font support, and in one case, even real-time 3D gaming using texture mapping.

The first 50,000 Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; computers came with Steve Wozniak's &quot;Woz&quot; signature silkscreened on the front and were referred to as the &quot;Woz Limited Edition.&quot; These machines are not functionally different from machines from the same time period without the signature.

The Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; with 1 Megabyte of built-in RAM (better known as the &quot;ROM 3&quot;), was introduced in late 1989.  Along with the additional built-in memory, the ROM 3 contained improvements to the firmware and cleaner sound output. Connector locations that had enabled the previous II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; motherboard to be installed in an Apple IIe case were eliminated to save costs. Most users considered the ROM 3 a minor maintenance update rather than a new model.

===Apple IIc Plus===
[[Image:Apple_IIc_Plus.jpg|thumb|right|The Apple IIc Plus, an 8-bit redux of the original portable but with faster CPU, 3&amp;frac12;&quot; floppy and built-in power supply. It was the last of the Apple II line.]]
The final Apple II model was the '''[[Apple IIc Plus]]''' introduced in 1988. It was the same size and shape as the IIc that came before it, but the 5&amp;frac14;&quot; floppy drive had been replaced with a 3&amp;frac12;&quot; drive, the power supply was moved inside (gone was the IIc's &quot;brick on a leash&quot; power supply), and the processor was a fast 4MHz 65C02 processor that actually ran 8-bit Apple II software faster than the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. (Third-party accelerators for other models could, however, go as fast as 10MHz, and II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; accelerators would eventually reach 16MHz.) The IIc Plus's accelerator was derived from a design licensed from Zip Technologies, a third-party maker of accelerators for the Apple II, though Apple used separate chips instead of combining the processor, cache, and supporting logic on a multi-chip module as did Zip. Like later models of the original Apple IIc, the IIc Plus included a memory expansion slot that would accept a daughtercard carrying up to a megabyte of RAM. The IIc Plus also featured a new keyboard layout that matched the Platinum IIe and II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. 

Many perceived the IIc Plus as Apple's attempt to compete with the Laser 128EX/2, a popular third party Apple-compatible machine that also had an accelerated processor and a built-in 3&amp;frac12;&quot; drive. There were few other rational explanations for Apple expending resources on the continued development of a new 8-bit Apple II model rather than furthering the 16-bit Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. However, with its 3&amp;frac12;&quot; drive and speedy processor, it was an excellent, compact machine for running the AppleWorks integrated productivity package, especially with the 1 megabyte memory upgrade.

===Apple IIe Card===
Although not an extension of the Apple II line, in 1990 the '''[[Apple IIe Card]]''', an expansion card for the [[Macintosh LC|LC]] line of [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers, was released.  Essentially a miniaturized Apple IIe computer on a card (utilizing the Mega II chip from the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;), it allowed the Macintosh to run 8-bit Apple IIe software through hardware emulation (although video was emulated in software and was slower at times than a IIe). Many of the LC's built-in Macintosh peripherals could be &quot;borrowed&quot; by the card when in Apple II mode (i.e. extra RAM, 3&amp;frac12;&quot; floppy, AppleTalk networking, hard disk). The IIe card could not, however, run software intended for the 16-bit Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. The Macintosh LC with IIe Card was intended to replace the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; in schools and homes and was presumably the reason a new model Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; that was confirmed by insiders to be in development at one point was cancelled and never released.

===The Final Years===
Apple's Macintosh product line finally eclipsed the Apple II in the early '90s. Even after the introduction of the Macintosh, the Apple II had remained Apple's primary source of revenue for years: the Apple II and its associated community of third-party developers and retailers was once a billion-dollar-a-year industry. The computer was the first to attract a loyal user community, and many outspoken Apple II fans were bitter that the company had invested its Apple II profits into the Macintosh rather than using them to further the Apple II series. 

Despite a lack of advertising and little corporate support, Apple continued to sell the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; through the end of 1992. Apple brought an era to a close when the IIe was removed from the product line on [[October 15]], [[1993]].

==Clones==
[[Image:Taiwanese Apple II clone Cosmo.jpg|thumb|The Jiama (嘉馬) SPS-109, a [[Taiwan]]ese clone of the Apple II, looks almost identical to the Apple II and II+, including an identical [[computer case|case]], color and [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] layout.  The only noticeable physical difference is the label above the keyboard.]]
Like the IBM PC, the Apple II was frequently cloned, both in the [[United States]] and abroad. According to some sources (see below), more than 190 different models of Apple II clones were manufactured. Many of these had &quot;fruit&quot; names (e.g. &quot;Pineapple&quot;) to indicate to the initiated that they were Apple II clones. For many years the most widely-used microcomputer in the [[Soviet Bloc]] was the [[Agat_computer|Agat]], an over-sized Russian Apple II clone with a [[Cyrillic]] character set.

An [[Australia|Australian]]-produced clone of the Apple II was the [[Medfly_computer|Medfly]], named after the [[Mediterranean fruit fly]] that attacks apples. The Medfly computer featured a faster processor, more memory, detached keyboard, lower and upper case characters and a built-in disk controller.

The Ace clones from [[Franklin Computer Corporation]] are the best known and had the most lasting impact, as Franklin copied Apple's ROMs and software and freely admitted to doing so. Franklin's argument: a computer's ROM was simply a pattern of switches locked into a fixed position, and one cannot copyright a pattern of switches. Apple fought Franklin in court for about five years to get its clones off the market, and was ultimately successful when a court ruled that software stored in ROM was in fact copyrightable. Franklin later released non-infringing but less-compatible clones; these could run ProDOS and AppleWorks and had an Applesoft-like BASIC, but compatibility with other software was hit-or-miss.

Apple also challenged [[VTech]]'s [[Laser 128]], an enhanced clone of the Apple IIc first released in 1984, in court. This suit proved less fruitful for Apple, because VTech had [[reverse-engineer]]ed the Monitor ROM rather than copying it and had licensed Applesoft BASIC from its creator, [[Microsoft]]. Incredibly, Apple had neglected to obtain exclusive rights to the Applesoft dialect of BASIC from Microsoft; just as incredibly, VTech was the first cloner to bother licensing it. The Laser 128 proved popular and remained on the market for many years, both in its original form and in enhanced versions that ran faster than 1 MHz. Although it wasn't 100% compatible with the Apple II, it was close, and its popularity ensured that most major developers tested their software on a Laser as well on as genuine Apple machines. Because it was frequently sold via mail order and mass-market retailers such as [[Sears]], the Laser 128 may have cut into the sales of low-cost competitors such as [[Commodore Business Machines]] as much as it did Apple's.

While the first Apple II clones were generally exact copies of their Apple counterparts that competed mainly on price, many clones had extra capabilities too. A Franklin model, the Ace 1000, sported a numeric keypad and lower-case long before these features were added to the Apple II line. The Laser 128 series is sometimes credited with spurring Apple to release the Apple IIc Plus; the built-in 3&amp;frac12;&quot; drive and accelerated processor were features Laser had pioneered. The Laser 128 also had a IIe-style expansion slot on the side that could be used to add peripheral cards.

[[Böwe Bell &amp; Howell|Bell &amp; Howell]], an audiovisual equipment manufacturer whose products (particularly film projectors) were ubiquitous in American schools, offered what appeared at first glance to be an Apple II Plus clone in a distinctive black plastic case. However, these were in fact real Apple II Pluses manufactured by Apple for B&amp;H for a brief period of time. Many schools had a few of these &quot;black Apples&quot; in their labs.

==General==
===Apple II media===
Originally the Apple II used audio cassette tapes for program and data storage. Apple and many third-party developers made software available on tape until the introduction of the Disk II.

The Disk II floppy drive used 5&amp;frac14;-inch [[floppy disk]]s. The first [[disk operating system]]s for the Apple II were [[Apple DOS|DOS 3.1]] and DOS 3.2, which stored 113.75 [[Kibibyte|KiB]] on each disk, organized into thirty-five tracks of thirteen 256-byte sectors each.  After about two years, DOS 3.3 was introduced, storing 140 KiB thanks to a minor hardware change on the disk controller that allowed it to store 16 sectors per track. (This upgrade was user-installable on older controllers.) After the release of DOS 3.3, the user community discontinued use of DOS 3.2 except for running legacy software. Programs that required DOS 3.2 were fairly rare, however, as DOS 3.3 was not a major architectural change aside from the number of sectors per track. A program called MUFFIN was provided with DOS 3.3 to allow users to copy files from DOS 3.2 disks to DOS 3.3 disks.

On a DOS 3.x disk, tracks 0, 1, and most of track 2 were reserved to store the operating system. A short ROM program on the disk controller had the ability to seek to track zero -- which it did without regard for the read/write head's current position, resulting in the characteristic &quot;chattering&quot; sound of a Disk II boot, which was the read/write head hitting the rubber stop block at the end of the rail -- and read and execute code from sector 0.  The disk's directory was stored on track 17, smack in the middle of the 35-track disks, in order to reduce the average [[seek time]] to the frequently-used directory track. The directory was fixed in size and could hold a maximum of 105 files. Subdirectories were not supported.

Most game publishers did not include DOS on their floppy disks, since they needed the memory it occupied more than its capabilities; instead, they often wrote their own boot loaders and read-only file systems. This also served to discourage &quot;crackers&quot; from snooping around in the game's copy-protection code, since the data on the disk wasn't in files that could be accessed easily.

Some third-party manufacturers produced floppy drives that could write 40 tracks to most 5&amp;frac14;-inch disks, yielding 160 KiB of storage per disk, but the format did not catch on widely, and no known software was published on 40-track media. Most drives, even Disk IIs, could write 36 tracks; simple modifications to DOS for formatting the extra track were common.

Later, Apple IIs were able to use 3&amp;frac12;-inch disks with a total capacity of 800 KB and hard disks. DOS 3.3 did not support these drives natively; third-party software was required, and disks larger than about 400 KB had to be split up into multiple &quot;virtual disk volumes.&quot; [[ProDOS]], a 1983 descendent of the Apple ///'s SOS, became the Apple II operating system of choice for users with these larger disks thanks to its native support of volumes up to 32 [[Megabyte|MB]] in size (and the fact that AppleWorks required it).

===Renditions of the &quot;II&quot; name===
The &quot;II&quot; portion of the Apple II name was rendered in a variety of creative ways using punctuation symbols on the front lids of the computers, and most printed material followed this lead. For example, the II and the &quot;unenhanced&quot; IIe was most commonly written &lt;nowiki&gt;][ and ][e,&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the IIc and enhanced and platinum IIe models were written as //c and //e. Finally, the IIgs and IIc Plus were rendered in the forms used in this article. To match the silkscreening on the front of the computer, [[small caps]] were often used for the &quot;gs&quot; in &quot;IIgs&quot; if available, otherwise lowercase was usually used for the &quot;gs&quot;.

===Life after death===
[[Image:Apple2_BSOD.jpg|thumb|250px|&quot;BSOD&quot; XScreensaver module showing a crashed Apple II]]
[[Image:Apple2_Screensaver.jpg|thumb|250px|&quot;Apple2&quot; XScreensaver module typing a BASIC program]]

Today, [[emulator|emulators]] for various Apple II models are available to run Apple II software on the Macintosh, Linux, Microsoft Windows, and other operating systems. Numerous [[disk image]]s of Apple II software are available free over the [[Internet]] for use with these emulators. However, emulators cannot run software on copy-protected media unless somebody &quot;cracks&quot; (removes the copy restrictions from) the software. The Lost Classics Project had as its goal convincing copyright holders of classic Apple II software to officially allow unrestricted free distribution of their software and has &quot;freed&quot; a number of programs.

One unusual homage to the Apple II is an [[XScreenSaver]] &quot;hack&quot; named ''bsod''.  The bsod [[screensaver]] duplicates the appearance of [[computer crash]] screens for various operating systems (including the Windows [[Blue Screen of Death]], after which it is named).  In the case of the Apple II, the screensaver actually emulates the [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] display typically used with the computer, so the screen will appear to twitch as text blocks turn on and off, a common quirk of analog NTSC displays. Another module called &quot;Apple2&quot; shows a working Apple II being used to type and run three different [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] programs, also with glitch-complete CRT emulation and even typos (or &quot;syntax errors&quot;).

===Industry impact===
It is difficult to estimate the enormous impact that the Apple II family of computers has had on world business and, especially, the technology industry. The Apple II was the first computer many people ever saw, and it was affordable enough for middle-class families. Its popularity bootstrapped the entire [[computer game]] and the [[educational software]] markets and began a boom in the [[word processor]] and [[computer printer]] markets. The first microcomputer &quot;[[killer app]]&quot; for business was ''[[VisiCalc]]'', the first [[spreadsheet]], and it ran first on the Apple II; many businesses bought Apple IIs just to run VisiCalc. Apple's success in the home market inspired competitive [[home computer]]s such as the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] (1980) and [[Commodore 64]] (1982), which through their significantly lower price point introduced computers to several million more home users -- grabbing some of Apple's market share in the process.

The success of the Apple II in business spurred [[IBM]] to create the [[IBM PC]], which was then purchased by middle managers in all lines of business in order to run [[spreadsheet]] and [[word processor]] software, at first ported from Apple II versions; later, whole new application software dynasties would be founded on the PC. The popularity of these PCs and their [[IBM PC compatible|clones]] then transformed business again with [[local area network|LAN]] applications such as [[e-mail]] and later Internet applications such as [[Usenet]] and the [[World Wide Web|WWW]].

One valuable lesson from the Apple II was the importance of an open architecture to the success of a computer platform. The first Apple IIs shipped with a schematic of the entire computer's circuitry and a complete source listing of the &quot;Monitor&quot; ROM software that served as the machine's BIOS, along with a detailed technical manual. The Apple II's slots, allowing any peripheral card to take control of the bus, enabled an independent industry of card manufacturers who together created a flood of hardware products that let users build systems that were far more powerful and useful (at a lower cost) than any competing system, most of which were not nearly as expandable and were universally proprietary. Even the game port was unusually powerful and could be used for digital and analog input and output; one hacker used it to drive a [[LaserWriter]] printer.

Apple decided not to create an open architecture with the initial [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] models, and this is widely seen as having hobbled its success. Meanwhile, IBM had created its [[IBM PC]] with an open architecture, which resulted in the near-universal adoption of the platform but led to a [[Pyrrhic victory]] for IBM itself. In the end, its off-the-shelf, open architecture allowed [[IBM PC compatible|clones]] to be manufactured by startup competitors such as [[Compaq]], [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], [[Gateway Computers|Gateway]], and countless others, leading eventually to IBM's abandonment of the personal computer business in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div&gt;[[image:Apple3.jpg|thumb|right|325px|The Apple III, an early business machine predating the IBM PC]]&lt;/div&gt;

The '''Apple III''', or '''Apple ///''' as it was sometimes styled, was the first completely new computer designed by [[Apple Computer]], Inc. Its predecessor, the better-known [[Apple II]], was designed by Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] prior to the company's incorporation in [[1976]]. Design work on the Apple III started in late [[1978]] under the guidance of Dr. [[Wendell Sander]]. It had the internal code name of &quot;Sara&quot;, named after Sander's daughter. The Apple III was introduced in May [[1980]].

The Apple III was designed to be a business computer. It featured an advanced [[operating system]] called [[SOS (operating system)|SOS]] (the '''S'''ophisticated '''O'''perating '''S'''ystem) and a new [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], &quot;Apple /// Business BASIC&quot; (an implementation of UCSD [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] was also offered for more structured programming). Other features included an 80-column display with upper and lowercase characters, a numeric keypad, support for a real-time clock, 6-bit (DAC) audio, 16-color graphics, hierarchical level file support, and the ability to emulate a 48[[kilobyte|KB]] Apple II+. There was a built-in 140K 5.25&quot; [[floppy disk]] drive, with up to three additional external &quot;Disk ///&quot; floppy disk drives and a [[Apple ProFile|ProFile]] 5 [[megabyte]] [[hard disk]] drive available as options. Microsoft developed an add-in &quot;Softcard&quot; that allowed the Apple III to run [[CP/M]], which was actually sold as an Apple product.

The Apple III was powered by a 1.8 [[megahertz|MHz]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502B]] [[8-bit]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] and, like some of the more advanced machines in the Apple II family, used [[bank switching]] techniques to address up to 256K of memory (512K with a third-party upgrade).

For a variety of reasons, the Apple III was a commercial failure. With a starting price of about $3,500 US, it was more expensive than many of the CP/M-based business computers that were available at the time. The Apple III's software library was very limited, and whilst sold as an Apple II compatible, the emulation that made this possible was intentionally hobbled, thus it could not make use of the advanced III features (specifically 64K RAM or higher, required by a large number of Apple II software titles based on PASCAL) which limited its usefulness. Far more importantly, the machine was plagued by numerous hardware and software [[computer bug|bug]]s. The real time clock, the first in an Apple computer, would fail after prolonged use. At Steve Jobs' insistence, the machine did not include a cooling fan—the metal case was supposed to act as a [[heat sink]], despite not being designed for this purpose. Furthermore, the case itself was too small to properly accommodate the III's internals, and Apple skimped on gold-plating the electrical contacts. The result was an unmitigated disaster. The system would overheat so severly that the motherboard would warp in its tight confines, and thermal expansion would actually push the [[dual in-line package|DIP]] chips out of their sockets. One popular anecdote about the Apple III is probably better remembered than the machine itself: in a technical bulletin, customers were actually instructed to lift the machine three inches (76 mm) and drop it in order to reseat the chips.

An improved version, the '''Apple III Plus''', was introduced in December [[1983]]. The III Plus fixed the hardware problems of the original III, included 256KB RAM, built-in clock, video interlacing, and featured a keyboard in the style of the [[Apple IIe]]. However, not even the new &quot;allow me to reintroduce myself&quot; campaign could salvage the III's reputation. Possibly more relevant in the long run was the fact that the III was essentially an enhanced Apple II—newest heir to a line of [[8-bit]] machines dating back to [[1976]]. The year after the III was originally released, [[IBM]] unveiled its [[IBM PC|PC]]—a completely new [[16-bit]] design soon available in a wide range of inexpensive clones. The business market moved rapidly towards the IBM machines and, in September 1985, the Apple III line was discontinued, having sold only about 65,000 systems.

Some of the features and codebase of the Sophisticated Operating System made their way into the Apple II's [[ProDOS]] and [[GS/OS]] operating systems, as well as those of the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]].

Although the Apple III shares much of the same technology and traits found in the Apple II series, it is not part of the Apple II family line. Not being a direct Apple II compatible, a special boot disk was required to put it into II emulation mode, much like the [[Apple Lisa]] in how it emulated the Macintosh. For this and other reasons, the Apple III can be considered a cousin of the Apple II rather than a member of its family line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Non-AVLtree.png|thumb|right|251px|An example of a '''non-AVL''' tree]]

In [[computer science]], an '''AVL tree''' is the first-invented [[self-balancing binary search tree]]. In an AVL tree the heights of the two [[child node|child]] subtrees of any node differ by at most one, therefore it is also known as [[height-balanced tree|height-balanced]]. Lookup, insertion, and deletion are all [[big O notation|O]](log ''n'') in both the average and worst cases. Additions and deletions may require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more [[tree rotation]]s.

The AVL tree is named after its two inventors, [[Georgii Adelson-Velsky|G.M. Adelson-Velsky]] and [[Yevgeniy Landis|E.M. Landis]], who published it in their [[1962]] paper &quot;An algorithm for the organization of information.&quot;

The '''balance factor''' of a node is the height of its right subtree minus the height of its left subtree. A node with balance factor 1, 0, or -1 is considered balanced. A node with any other balance factor is considered unbalanced and requires rebalancing the tree. The balance factor is either stored directly at each node or computed from the heights of the subtrees. 

[[Image:AVLtree.png|thumb|right|251px|The same tree after being height-balanced]]


==Operations==
The basic operations of an AVL tree generally involve carrying out the same algorithms as would be carried out on an unbalanced [[binary search tree]], but preceded or followed by one or more of the so-called &quot;AVL rotations.&quot;

===Insertion===
Insertion into an AVL tree may be carried out by inserting the given value into the tree as if it were an unbalanced binary search tree, and then retracing one's steps toward the root, rotating about any nodes which have become unbalanced during the insertion (see ''[[tree rotation]]''). Since at most 1.5 times [[binary logarithm|lg&amp;nbsp;''n'']] nodes are retraced on the journey back to the root, and each AVL rotation takes constant time, the insertion process in total takes O(log&amp;nbsp;''n'')&amp;nbsp;time.

===Deletion===
Deletion from an AVL tree may be carried out by rotating the node to be deleted down into a leaf node, and then pruning off that leaf node directly. Since at most log&amp;nbsp;''n'' nodes are rotated during the rotation into the leaf, and each AVL rotation takes constant time, the deletion process in total takes O(log&amp;nbsp;''n'')&amp;nbsp;time...

===Lookup===
Lookup in an AVL tree is performed exactly as in an unbalanced binary search tree, and thus takes O(log ''n'') time, since an AVL tree is always kept balanced. No special provisions need to be taken, and the tree's structure is not modified by lookups. (This is in contrast to [[splay tree]] lookups, which do modify their tree's structure.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[chemistry]], '''aliphatic compounds''' are non-[[aromatic]] [[organic compound]]s.  They include not only the [[fatty acid]]s and other derivatives of the [[paraffin]] [[hydrocarbon]]s ([[alkane]]), but also unsaturated compounds, such as the [[ethylene]] ([[alkene]]) and [[acetylene]] ([[alkyne]]) series.  Aliphatic [[molecule]]s consist, in general, of a backbone of [[carbon]] [[atom]]s and other atoms bound to this carbon chain &amp;mdash; most frequently [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], and various [[halide]]s.  The simplest aliphatic compound is [[methane]] ([[Carbon|C]][[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

      <comment>/* History of astrology */  typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Astrology''' refers to any of several systems, [[tradition]]s or [[belief]]s in which knowledge of the apparent positions of [[celestial bodies]] is held to be useful in understanding, interpreting, and organizing knowledge about human affairs and events on earth. A practitioner of astrology is called an '''astrologer''' or, less often, an '''astrologist'''.

The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] αστρολογία = άστρον, ''astron'', &quot;star&quot; and the [[English language|English]] [[suffix]], ''[[-ology]]'', &quot;study or discipline&quot;.  -ology is in turn derived from the Greek λόγος, ''[[logos]]'', which has a variety of meanings in English but generally related to &quot;[[system]]atic thought or speech&quot;.

Although the two fields share a common origin, modern [[astronomy]] as practiced is not to be confused with astrology. While astronomy is the study and observation of celestial objects and their movements through space, astrology is the study of the supposed correlation of those objects with earthly affairs. There is as yet no accepted evidence that astrology has a [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]], scientific basis.
[[Image:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|375px|The [[Flammarion Woodcut]], an enigmatic [[woodcut]] by an unknown artist.]]
==Description==
[[Image:Astrological Glyphs.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Astrological [[glyph]]s representing the planets.]]
The core principles of astrology reflect a general principle, which was accepted throughout most of the ancient world, that events in the heavens should have analogies on Earth.  Such ancient beliefs are epitomized in the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] [[proverb|maxim]]: ''As Above, So Below''. The famous [[astronomer]]/[[astrologer]] [[Tycho Brahe]] also used a similar phrase to justify his studies in astrology: ''Suspiciendo despicio'' &amp;mdash; &quot;By looking up I see downward.&quot;  Although the principle that events in the heavens are mirrored by those on Earth was one generally held in most traditions of astrology across the world, historically in the West there has been a debate over the nature of the mechanism behind astrology and whether or not celestial bodies are only signs or [[portent]]s of events, or if they are actual causes of events through some sort of force or mechanism.  

Many of those who practice astrology believe the positions of certain celestial bodies either influences or correlates with people's [[personality]] traits, important events in their lives, physical characteristics, and to some extent their [[destiny]]. 

All astrological traditions are based on the relative positions and movements of various real and construed [[celestial body|celestial bodies]] as seen at the time and place of the event being studied.  These are chiefly the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[planet]]s, and the [[lunar node]]s.  The calculations performed in astrology involve arithmetic and simple geometry and serve to locate the apparent position of heavenly bodies on desired dates and times based on astronomical tables.

In past centuries astrology often relied on close observation of celestial objects, and the charting of their movements, and might be considered a [[protoscience]] in this regard. In modern times astrologers have tended to rely on data drawn up by [[astronomers]] and set out in a set of tables called an [[ephemeris]], which shows the changing positions of the heavenly bodies through time. It is the interpretation of these science-based tables that makes astrology a target for the label [[pseudoscience]].

== Traditions ==
There are many different traditions of astrology, some of which share similar features due to the transmission of astrological doctrines from one culture to another.  Other traditions developed in isolation and hold completely different doctrines, although they too share some similar features due to the fact that they are drawing on similar astronomical sources, i.e. planets, stars, etc.

== Horoscopic astrology ==
Horoscopic astrology is a very specific and complex system of astrology that was developed in the [[Mediterranean]] region and specifically [[Hellenistic]] [[Egypt]] sometime around the late 2nd or early 1st century BCE{{ref|Pingree}} that deals largely with astrological charts cast for specific moments in time in order to interpret the inherent meaning underlying the alignment of the planets at that moment based on specific sets of rules and guidelines. One of the defining characteristics of this form of astrology that makes it distinct from other traditions is the computation of the degree of the Eastern horizon rising against the backdrop of the [[ecliptic]] at the specific moment under examination, otherwise known as the [[ascendant]].  This has been the most influential and widespread form of astrology accross the world, especially in [[India]], [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], and there are several major traditions of horoscopic astrology including [[Jyotish|Indian]], Hellenistic, Medieval, and most other modern western traditions of astrology.  

=== The Horoscope ===
[[Image:Natal Chart -- Adam.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A Western [[natal chart]].]]
Central to horoscopic astrology is the calculation of a [[horoscope]], or astrological chart. This is a diagrammatic representation in two dimensions of the celestial bodies' apparent positions in the heavens from the vantage of a location on [[Earth]] at a given time and place. The horoscope of an individual's birth is called a [[natal chart]]. In ancient Hellenistic astrology the rising sign or [[Ascendant]] demarcated the first celestial house of a chart, and the word for the ascendant in Greek was ''horoskopos''. This is the word that the term &quot;horoscope&quot; derives from and in modern times it has come to be used as a general term for an astrological chart, or to denote the birth chart of an individual as a whole. Other commonly used names for the horoscope/natal chart in English include natus, birth-chart, astrological chart, astro-chart, celestial map, sky-map, star-chart, nativity, cosmogram, vitasphere, soulprint, radical chart, radix, or simply ''chart'', among others.

=== Zodiac ===
The path of the sun across the heavens as seen from Earth during a full year is called the [[ecliptic]] by astronomers. This, and the nearby band of sky followed by the visible planets is called the [[zodiac]] by astrologers. A few Western and all [[Jyotish]] ([[Hindu]]) astrologers use the [[sidereal zodiac]], which uses the true astronomical positions of the stars and constellations which lie on the ecliptic. The majority of Western astrologers base their work on the [[tropical zodiac]], which aligns with the seasons in the Northern hemisphere but not with the actual positions of the sidereal zodiac.

=== Branches of Horoscopic Astrology ===
Every tradition of horoscopic astrology can be divided up into four specific branches which are directed towards specific subjects or used for specific purposes.  Often this involves using a unique set of techniques or a different application of the core principles of the system to a different area.  

The branches of horoscopic astrology are:
:*[[natal astrology|Genethliacal astrology/natal astrology/Jataka]] (the study of a person's [[natal chart]]) 
:*[[electional astrology|Katarchic Astrology/electional astrology/Muhurta]] (the act of chosing a chart ahead of time to determine the most auspicious moment to begin an enterprise or undertaking)
:*[[horary astrology|Interrogational astrology/horary astrology/Prasna]] (a chart drawn up in order to answer a specific question which is posed to the astrologer)
:*[[Mundane astrology]] (the study of large groups of people such as cities and nations, as well events both natural and man made)

==History of astrology==
{{main|History of astrology}}
The origins much of the astrology that would later develop in [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] are found among the ancient [[Babylonians]] and their system of celestial omens that began to be compiled around the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE. This system of celestial omens later spread either directly or indirectly through the Babylonians to other areas such as [[India]], [[China]] and [[Greece]] where it merged with preexisting indigenous forms of astrology. This Babylonian astrology came to Greece initially as early as the middle of the [[4th century BCE]], and then around the late 2nd or early 1st century BCE after the [[Alexander the Great#Period of conquests|Alexandrian conquests]], this Babylonian astrology was mixed with the Egyptian tradition of Decanic astrology to create [[Horoscopic astrology]]. This new form of astrology, which appears to have originated in [[Alexandria|Alexandrian Egypt]], quickly spread across the ancient world into Europe, the Middle East and India.  For a detailed description, including astrology in other cultures, see the [[History of astrology|main article]].

==The validity of astrology==
[[Image:Cellarius ptolemaic system.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Ptolemaic system]] depicted by [[Andreas Cellarius]], 1660/61 ]]
{{main|Validity of astrology}}
Astrology is a very [[controversy|controversial]] subject. The case ''for'' and the case ''against'' astrology's [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] validity are discussed in more detail in the main article. 

Few astrologers today believe that a causal relationship exists between heavenly bodies and earthly events, but there are a number who have called for better statistical studies (for example, Mark McDonough, the President of Astrodatabank [http://www.astrodatabank.com]) and several individuals (most notably [[Michel Gauquelin]]) who have found correlations between some planetary positions and certain vocations.  Many astrologers have posited [[acausal]] relationships between astrological observations and events, such as the theory of [[synchronicity]] {{ref|Maggie}} proposed by [[Jung]].  Many others have assumed there was a  [[religious]] mechanism in operation, from the original Mediterranean astrologers through [[Guido Bonatti]] from [[Forlì]] ([[Italy]]), [[William Lilly]], and to some extent, [[Geoffrey Cornelius]].{{ref|TMoA_op}} 

[[Skepticism|Skeptic]]s see astrology as repeatedly failing to demonstrate its effectiveness in [[Empiricism|controlled studies]], one prominent group saying those who &quot;continue to have faith in astrology do so in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary.&quot; and have gone so far as to call astrology &quot;the pretentious claims of astrological charlatans.&quot;  {{ref|Bok_op}}

==Effects on world culture==
[[Image:Beit Alpha.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Zodiac]] in a [[6th century]] [[synagogue]] at Beit Alpha, [[Israel]].]]
Astrology has had a profound influence over the past few thousand years on Western and Eastern cultures, along with the [[English language]]. [[Influenza]] was so named because [[physician|doctors]] once believed it to be caused by unfavorable planetary and stellar influences. The word &quot;''disaster''&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;''dis-aster''&quot; meaning &quot;''bad star''&quot;. Also, the adjectives &quot;lunatic&quot; (Moon), &quot;mercurial&quot; (Mercury), &quot;martial&quot; (Mars), &quot;jovial&quot; (Jupiter/Jove), and &quot;saturnine&quot; (Saturn) are all old words used to describe personal qualities said to resemble or be highly influenced by the astrological characteristics of the planet, some of which are derived from the attributes of the ancient Roman gods they are named after.

There are many Astrological references in the Old and New Testament.

===Astrology as a descriptive language for the mind===
Many writers, notably [[William Shakespeare]] [http://www.chartplanet.com/html/shakespeare.html], used astrological symbolism to add subtlety and nuance to the description of his characters' motivation(s). An understanding of astrological principles is needed to fully appreciate such literature, along with the work of many other writers and poets of this and many other eras. Some modern thinkers, notably [[Carl Jung]], have acknowledged its descriptive powers of the mind without necessarily subscribing to its predictive claims.

Astrological interpretation is dependent on the particular culture's prevailing mythology.  Most classicists think that Western astrology is dependent on Greek mythology.  But the Greeks never claimed to have their own mythology.  The Greeks claimed that half of their mythology was borrowed from the Egyptians and the other half borrowed from the Hebrew.  But where did the myths of the Egyptians and Hebrew come from?  The upper Nile River - Ethiopia. (See &quot;Black Athena&quot;, Rutgers University Press)  The research of the Gauquelin's, which resulted into Neo-Astrology, has modified, updated, but mainly reinforced the Ethiopian/Greek/Roman word association of behavioral characteristics with the particular planets.

==Western Astrology and the classical elements==
{{main|Astrology and the classical elements}}
Astrology has used the concept of classical elements from antiquity up until the present. Most modern [[astrologers]] use the four classical elements extensively, and indeed it is still viewed as a critical part of interpreting the [[natal chart|astrological chart]].

==Western Astrology and alchemy==
[[Image:Alchemy-Digby-RareSecrets.png|thumb|right|300px|Extract and symbol key from 17th century [[alchemy]] text.]]
{{main|Astrology and alchemy}}
[[Alchemy]] in the [[Western World]] and other locations where it was widely practiced was (and in many cases still is) closely allied and intertwined with traditional [[Babylon]]ian-Greek style astrology; in numerous ways they were built to complement each other in the search for [[occult|hidden knowledge]]. Traditionally, each of the seven [[planet]]s in the [[solar system]] as known to the ancients was associated with, held dominion over, and ''[[astrological sign|ruled]]'' a certain [[metal]].

A separate article also exists on [[astrology and numerology]].

==The seven liberal arts and Western astrology==
[[Image:Anatomical Man.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The anatomical-astrological human in [[medical astrology]].]]
[[Image:Astrological_remedies.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Table from [[18th century]] [[Iceland]]ic manuscript linking astrological dates with preparation of medicine.]]
In [[medieval Europe]], a [[university education]] was divided into seven distinct areas, each represented by a particular [[planet]] and known as the Seven [[Liberal Arts]]. 

They were seen as operating in ascending order, beginning with [[Grammar]] which was assigned to the quickest moving [[celestial body]] (the [[Moon]]) and culminating in [[Astrology and astronomy|Astronomia]] which was thought to be [[Astrological sign|astrologically ruled]] by [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]], the slowest moving and furthest out planet known at the time. After this sequence [[wisdom]] was supposed to have been achieved by the [[medieval]] [[College student|university student]].

[[Dante|Dante Alighieri]] used the following associations of the seven [[liberal arts]] to the seven traditional astrological planets in the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' and ''[[Convivio]]''.

*[[Astrology and astronomy|Astronomia]] — [[Saturn (astrology)|Saturn]]
*[[Geometry]] — [[Jupiter (astrology)|Jupiter ]]
*[[Arithmetic]] — [[Mars (astrology)|Mars]]
*[[Music]] — [[Sun (astrology)|Sun]]
*[[Rhetoric]] — [[Venus (astrology)|Venus]]
*[[Dialectic]] — [[Mercury (astrology)|Mercury]]
*[[Grammar]] — [[Moon (astrology)|Moon]]

== Astrology and the days of the week ==

Seven days of the week are created on the basis of 24 (''Hora'') divisions of the day and heliocentric order of the planets. In Hindu system of astrology, a weekday starts from local Sunrise &amp; ends at the following Sunrise, which is distinct from the Georgian calendar in which a weekday along with date starts at expiry of 1200 a.m. of the Zonal Standard Time. Julian day begins at noon, whereas the Julian calendar begins at preceding midnight. Georgian calendar is worldwide used for civil purpose. 

A day is divided in 24 divisions called “''Hora''” in Hindu system. The order of Hora is based on heliocentric order of the planets which is; Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, (Earth), Venus, Mercury, &amp; Moon. It is said that the world started on Sunday. And the first Hora of the Sunday is ruled by the Sun. Second Hora of Sunday is ruled by Venus, followed by Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter &amp; Mars. Thus Sunday has three cycles of the above Horas &amp; its 25th Hora is of Moon. Thus at the next Sunrise time Hora of Moon shall prevail. Therefore, the following day is ruled by the Moon. Similarly 25th Hora of Monday shall be of Mars,  &amp; the day shall be ruled by Mars. In the same way following days shall be ruled by Mercury, Jupiter, Venus &amp; Saturn. Thus order of the weekdays are ruled by Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus &amp; Saturn. This logic has already been mentioned in Hindu astrology treatises. 

In Hindu system the Sun is called ''Ravi''; The Moon – ''Soma''; Mars – ''Mangal''; Mercury- ''Budh''; Jupiter – ''Brishapati''; Venus – ''Shukar''; &amp; Saturn –'' Shani''. The day is called “Vaar”. Thus weekdays in order have been named as ''Ravi Vaar, Soma Vaar, Mangal Vaar, Budh Vaar, Brihaspati Vaar, Shukar Vaar, and Shani Vaar.''

In Latin the Sun is called Solis; &amp; the Moon – Lunae; Mars- Martis; Mercury – Mercurri; Jupiter – Jovis; Venus- Veneris; Saturn – Saturni. Thus names of the weekday are derived from the planetary names. 

In electional astrology, weekday &amp; Hora of the specific planet has special significance. Hora is also used in calculation of planetary strength in a nativity. In general, a work which fructifies in a particular weekday, also can be performed during Hora of the weekday lord falling in another weekday. For example, it is recommended to solemnize marriage on Thursday, also can be done during Hora of Jupiter falling in Friday (a weekday ruled by a benefic planet). This usage of Hora in electional astrology is also applied by western astrologers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[abstract algebra]], a [[field extension]] ''L'' /''K'' is called '''algebraic''' if every element of ''L'' is [[algebraic element|algebraic]] over ''K'', i.e. if every element of ''L'' is a [[root (mathematics)|root]] of some non-zero [[polynomial]] with coefficients in ''K''. 
Field extensions which are not algebraic, i.e. which contain [[transcendental element]]s, are called '''transcendental'''.

For example, the field extension [[real number|'''R''']]/[[rational number|'''Q''']] is transcendental, while the field extensions [[complex number|'''C''']]/'''R''' and '''Q'''(&amp;radic;2)/'''Q''' are algebraic.

If ''L'' is regarded as a [[vector space]] over ''K'', one can consider its [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] as such. This dimension is also called the '''degree''' of the extension. The extension ''L/K'' can then be further classified as a '''finite''' or '''infinite''' extension according to this dimension. All transcendental extensions are of infinite degree. This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic. 

The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic. For instance, the field of all [[algebraic number]]s is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers.

If ''a'' is algebraic over ''K'', then ''K''[''a''], the set of all polynomials in ''a'' with coefficients in ''K'', is a field. It is an algebraic field extension of ''K'' which has finite degree over ''K''. In the special case where ''K''='''Q''' is the [[rational number|field of rational numbers]], '''Q'''[''a''] is an example of an [[algebraic number field]].

A field with no proper algebraic extensions is called
[[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. An example is the field of [[complex number]]s.
Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its [[algebraic closure]]), but proving this in general requires
some form of the [[axiom of choice]].

==Generalizations==

[[Model theory]] generalizes the notion of algebraic extension to arbitrary
theories: an embedding of M into N is called an '''algebraic extension''' if for 
every ''x'' in N there is a formula ''p'' with parameters in M, such that
''p''(''x'') is true and the set 

:{''y'' in ''N'' | ''p''(''y'')}

is finite. It turns
out that applying this definition to the theory of fields gives the
usual definition of algebraic extension. The [[Galois group]] of N
over M can again be defined as the group of automorphisms, and it turns out
that most of the theory of Galois groups can be developed for 
the general case.

'''Ani DiFranco''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: ɑ-ni) (born '''Angela Marie Difranco''' on [[September 23]], [[1970]]) is a [[singer]], [[guitarist]], and [[songwriter]]. DiFranco is prolific, having produced three studio albums of new material and one remix album just in 1999 (see list below). She has released at least one album every year since 1990, with the exception of 2000 (perhaps because she released three albums in 1999 and a double album in 2001.) 

==Biography==

Born in [[Buffalo, New York]] to a [[Jewish American]] mother and an [[Italian-American]] father, DiFranco, the daughter of two folk music loving parents, started playing Beatles' covers at local bars with her guitar teacher ([http://www.righteousbabe.com/store/prod_albums.asp?id=473 Michael Meldrum]) at the age of nine,  and built her career from there. 

By the time she was fifteen, her family life imploded.  At this time, she moved out on her own, supporting herself mainly by her vocal performances, but still managed to graduate from [[The Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts]] school.

In 1989, at the age of eighteen, DiFranco started her own record company, [[Righteous Babe Records]], with just $50, and recorded ''[[Ani DiFranco (album)|Ani DiFranco]]'', issued in the winter of 1990. Later on she relocated to [[New York, New York|New York City]] and [[tour]]ed vigorously. 

She is openly [[bisexuality|bisexual]] and, in 1998, [[marriage|married]] [[sound engineer]] Andrew Gilchrist. They separated five years later but remain friends.  

DiFranco is currently taking time off from touring due to [[tendonitis]].

DiFranco's father died early in the summer of 2005; however she continued her summer tour as a legacy to him.

==Musical style and the &quot;folk&quot; label==

Many have noted a signature [[staccato]] style to DiFranco's work [http://folkmusic.about.com/od/artistsaz/p/AniD_profile.htm], [http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1997/06.11/revani.html]. Another important aspect is her skill in rapid [[fingerpicking]] and generally high ability on the acoustic guitar&amp;mdash;notably in the song &quot;Out of Range&quot;, appearing on the [[eponym]]ous [[Out of Range|album]]. Her lyrics have also received praise for their sophistication: [[alliteration]] (and wordplay in general) is an important component, and a more or less gentle [[irony]] fills many of her songs&amp;mdash;especially those that deal with the intersection of the [[personal]] and [[Politics|political]]. She is known for her descriptive use of [[metaphors]].  She delivers many of her lines in a speaking style notable for its rhythmic variation. The song &quot;Talkin' Ani DiFranco's Mom Blues,&quot; a [[talking blues]] song by [[Dan Bern]], strings together some of the most memorable lines from DiFranco's early career for comic effect.

DiFranco's music has been classified as [[folk rock]] and [[alternative rock]], but since her early albums she has reached across genres, having collaborated with a wide range of artists including the [[pop music]]ian [[Prince (artist)|Prince]], the folk musician [[Utah Phillips]], and both [[Maceo Parker|Maceo]] and [[Corey Parker]]. In various songs and albums, she has used a variety of [[musical instrument|instrument]]s as well as styles&amp;mdash;from [[brass instrument|brass]], notably in 1998's ''[[Little Plastic Castle]]'', and [[string instrument|strings]], particularly noticeable on the live album ''[[Living in Clip]]'' and her latest studio recording, ''[[Knuckle Down]]''. 

Regarding the &quot;folk&quot; label often applied, sometimes in qualified form, to her music, DiFranco has noted (in an interview with ''Pavement Magazine'') that &quot;folk music is not an acoustic guitar--that's not where the heart of it is. I use the word 'folk' in reference to punk music and rap music. It's an attitude, it's an awareness of one's heritage, and it's a community. It's subcorporate music that gives voice to different communities and their struggle against authority.&quot;

==Lyrics and politics==

Much of DiFranco's material is autobiographical, in the personal lyric tradition of the singer-songwriter. Much of her material is also strongly political, concerned with contemporary social issues such as [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[sexual abuse]], [[homophobia]], [[reproductive rights]], [[poverty]], and [[war]]. The combination of these two characteristics is partially responsible for the early popularity DiFranco enjoyed among politically active college students, some of whom set up [[Fan (aficionado)|fan pages]] on the [[World Wide Web|web]] to document her career as early as 1994. Because of DiFranco's rapid rise in popularity in the mid-1990s&amp;mdash;a rise that, with little [[Mainstream media|mainstream press]], was fueled by personal contact and word of mouth&amp;mdash;fans often expressed a feeling of community with each other.

DiFranco has expressed political views outside of her music. During the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]], she encouraged voting for [[Ralph Nader]] in non-[[swing state|battleground states]]. She supported [[Dennis Kucinich]] in the 2004 Democratic primaries.

==Label independence==

The success of her [[record label]], [[Righteous Babe Records]] (RBR), is also notable. Ownership of RBR allows DiFranco a great deal of artistic freedom, including the ability to release as much, and as often, as she has, and to include controversial material and language. References to her independence from major labels appear occasionally in her songs, most notably in &quot;The Million You Never Made,&quot; which discusses the act of turning down a lucrative contract, &quot;The Next Big Thing&quot;, a song from the early [[Not So Soft|''Not So Soft'']] album which describes an imagined meeting with a label headhunter who evaluates the singer based on her looks, and &quot;Napoleon,&quot; on the album ''[[Dilate|Dilate]]'', which sympathises sarcastically with an unnamed friend who did sign with a label. A longstanding rumor, apparently begun by [[Spin Magazine]] in 1997, suggests that the friend addressed in &quot;Napoleon&quot; is the musician [[Suzanne Vega]]; Vega herself has denied this [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/rec.music.artists.ani-difranco/msg/f8cf4eef04c30307?dmode=source&amp;hl=en].

DiFranco has occasionally joined with [[Prince (artist)|Prince]] in discussing publicly the problems associated with major record companies. DiFranco is proud of her label, which employs a number of people in her hometown of Buffalo.  In a 1997 open letter to [[Ms. magazine]] [http://www.columbia.edu/~marg/ani/letter.html] she expressed displeasure that what she sees as a way to ensure her own artistic freedom, was seen by others solely in terms of its financial success.

==Recent work==

''[[Educated Guess]]'', was released on [[January 20]], [[2004]]. According to the Righteous Babe website, &quot;not since the release of her second album back in 1991 has Ani been quite as much a solo act as she is on ''[[Educated Guess]]''.&quot;[http://www.righteousbabe.com/ani/educated_guess/more_info.asp] The only other person involved in the record was Greg Calbi, who mastered it.  DiFranco did all the performance and recording herself at home, and was involved in much of the artwork and design for the packaging.

A new album, ''[[Knuckle Down]]'', was released on [[January 25]], [[2005]]. On [[July 22]], [[2005]], Righteous Babe announced by e-mail that DiFranco has developed a case of [[tendonitis]] and will take a one-year hiatus from touring, returning to the road in the summer of 2006. DiFranco had toured almost continuously in the preceding fifteen years, taking brief breaks to record studio albums. Her 2005 tour concluded with an appearance at the [[FloydFest]] [[World Music]] and genre [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] festival in [[Floyd, Virginia]].

DiFranco's former drummer, [[Andy Stochansky]], has pursued a solo career as a singer-songwriter since leaving DiFranco's band.

DiFranco performed with [[Cyndi Lauper]] on Lauper's latest collection, ''The Body Acoustic''.  She also performed with fellow folk singer [[Dar Williams]] on her recent album, &quot;My Better Self&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ANA_487.jpg|right|250px|Anaheim Angels logo]]
&quot;'''Anaheim Angels'''&quot; was the former name of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], a [[Major League Baseball]] franchise based in [[Anaheim, California]], and aligned in the Western Division of the [[American League]]. The team, originally based in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and known as the '''Los Angeles Angels''', began play in 1961.  During the 1965 season, the club changed its name to the '''California Angels'''.  The team moved to Anaheim in 1966.  The team changed its name again in 1997, to the '''Anaheim Angels''', to comply with a clause in the team's stadium lease requiring that the team name &quot;include the name Anaheim therein.&quot;

On [[January 3]], [[2005]] Angels Baseball, L.P. announced that it would change the name of the club from the Anaheim Angels to the '''Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim'''. As stated in the club's 2005 media guide: &quot;The inclusion of Los Angeles reflects the original expansion name and returns the Angels as Major League Baseball's American League representative in the [[Greater Los Angeles]] territory.&quot; The change, Angels officials claimed, was compliant to the lease agreement.  

The City of Anaheim, the owner of [[Angel Stadium]], felt the new name to be a violation of the intent, if not the precise letter, of the naming clause of the lease agreement by club ownership.  Infuriated Anaheim city leaders filed suit against Angels Baseball, L.P. in [[Orange County, California|Orange County Superior Court]], claiming the team violated its lease with the City of Anaheim.  The city asked that the team name revert to Anaheim Angels and requested monetary damages for lost revenues to the city as a result of the name change.  The trial, initially set for [[November 7]], [[2005]], was postponed until [[January 9]], [[2006]].

On [[February 9]], [[2006]], the jury in the case found in favor of the team, allowing it to keep the name &quot;Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim,&quot; and denied the city any monetary compensation.  Although a final decision has not yet been made, Anaheim city officials have indicated that it is unlikely that the city will attempt to [[appeal]] the decision.

The '''Arizona Diamondbacks''' are a [[Major League Baseball]] team based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. They are in the  [[National League]] West division. They are popularly referred in the local press as the '''D-Backs''' or the '''Snakes'''.

== Franchise history ==

'''The desire for baseball in the desert'''

In the fall of 1993, [[Jerry Colangelo]], owner of the [[Phoenix Suns]], the area's wildly popular and successful [[NBA]] franchise, announced he was assembling an ownership group to apply for a Major League Baseball expansion team. This was after a great deal of lobbying by the [[Maricopa County Sports Authority]], a local group formed to preserve spring training in Arizona and eventually secure a Major League franchise for the state. This group was headed at the time by sports attorney [[Joe Garagiola, Jr.]] (Garagiola would go on to become the team's first general manager). Maricopa County superviors [[Jim Bruner]] and [[Mary Rose Wilcox]] were also key proponents of baseball in Phoenix, aligning themselves with Garagiola's group. A firestorm of local controversy was the result. Many area residents did not want public tax money used for a sports team. However, just as many residents felt that by the early 1990's, Phoenix had finally &quot;arrived&quot; as a major American city and deserved a Major League Baseball team.

All this was after a previous attempt was mounted by [[Martin Stone]], owner of the [[Phoenix Firebirds]], the city's [[Triple-A]] minor league baseball team and an affiliate of the [[San Francisco Giants]]. In the late 1980's Stone approached [[Arizona Cardinals|St. Louis (football) Cardinals]] owner Bill Bidwill about sharing a proposed 70,000 seat domed stadium in Phoenix; Bidwill, with plans already in the works to leave St. Louis, opted instead to sign a long term lease with [[Arizona State University]] to use its [[Sun Devil Stadium]] as the home of his soon-to-be Arizona based NFL franchise, thus ending Stone's bid.

Colangelo's group was ultimately successful. On March 9, 1995, the city of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] was awarded the Arizona Diamondbacks franchise for play beginning in the 1998 season, along with plans for a new retractable-roof ballpark, Bank One Ballpark (renamed in 2005 to [[Chase Field]]) to be built in an industrial/warehouse district on the southern edge of downtown Phoenix.

The name &quot;Diamondbacks&quot; was the winning choice in a name-the-team contest sponsored by Colangelo's group, which took out a full page ad promoting the contest in the sports section of the Feburary 13, 1995 edition of the [[Arizona Republic]]. (The group was known as &quot;Arizona Baseball, Inc.&quot; and seemed reasonably confident that a franchise would be awarded.) First prize was a pair of lifetime season tickets awarded to the person who submitted the winning entry.

As noted above, there was some controversy over public financing of a new stadium, but in the spring of 1994, the [[Maricopa County]] Board of Supervisors approved a quarter-cent increase in the county sales tax to pay for their portion of the stadium funding.

The Diamondbacks replaced the [[Phoenix Firebirds|Firebirds]], as that team was obligated to leave Phoenix soon after the Diamondbacks announcement, and is now the [[San Francisco Giants]] AAA affiliate, the [[Fresno Grizzlies]]. 

Two seasons before their first opening day, Colangelo hired [[Buck Showalter]], the American League Manager of the Year in 1994 with the [[New York Yankees]].

Their lower level minor league teams began play in 1997; the expansion draft was held that year as well. 



'''Early success and a World Series championship'''

The Diamondbacks' first major league game was played against the [[Colorado Rockies]] on [[March 31]], [[1998]], at [[Chase Field]] (then known as Bank One Ballpark). The Rockies won, 9-2, with [[Andy Benes]] on the mound for the Diamondbacks, and [[Travis Lee]] being the first player to hit, score, homer and drive in a run. Over 50,000 fans were in attendance.

In their first five seasons of existence, the Diamondbacks won three division titles (1999, [[2001]], &amp; 2002) and one [[World Series]]. In 1999, Arizona won over 100 games in only its second season to win the [[National League]] West division. They lost to the [[New York Mets]] in the first round of playoffs.

Colangelo fired Showalter after a relatively disappointing 2000 season, and replaced him with [[Bob Brenly]], the former Giants catcher and coach, who had up to that point been working as a color analyst on Diamondbacks television broadcasts.

In 2001, the team was led by two of the most dominant pitchers in all of baseball: [[Randy Johnson]] and [[Curt Schilling]]. Arizona had postseason victories over the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (3-2 in the [[National League Division Series|NLDS]]) and the [[Atlanta Braves]] (4-1 in the [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]]) to advance to the World Series where, in one of the most exciting series ever, they beat the reigning champions, the [[New York Yankees]], 4 to 3, to become the youngest expansion franchise to win the championship. 

An estimated crowd of 300,000 celebrated at the Diamondbacks victory parade, held at Bank One Ballpark and the surrounding downtown Phoenix streets on November 7, 2001. This was the first major professional sports championship for the state of Arizona and the first for a team (in the four major North American professional sports leagues) owned or controlled by Colangelo, whose basketball Suns made it to the [[NBA Finals]] in [[1976 NBA Finals|1976]] and [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]] but lost both times. (Colangelo's [[Arizona Rattlers]] won the [[Arena Football League]] championship in 1994 and 1997.)

For a detailed look at the 2001 series please see [[2001 World Series]].



'''Tough times and the end of the Colangelo era'''

By the 2004 season, however, the Diamondbacks had dropped to a dismal 51-111 record, the worst in [[Major League Baseball]] that year, despite [[Randy Johnson|Johnson]] pitching a [[perfect game]] on [[May 18]] of that season. [[Bob Brenly|Brenly]] was fired partway through the season and was replaced on an interim basis by coach [[Al Pedrique]].  

By this time Colangelo and the other partners were embroiled in a dispute over the financial health and direction of the Diamondbacks. He resigned his managing general partner post in the late summer of 2004.

Colangelo sold his controlling interest in the Arizona Diamondbacks team to a new group of investors lead by [[Jeff Moorad]], a former sports agent with several MLB players as clients, including key members of the Diamondbacks. Moorad was subsequently named CEO of the team and became its primary public face.

Following the 2004 season, the Diamondbacks also hired [[Wally Backman]] to be the team's manager.  Backman was formerly manager of the Class A [[California League]] [[Lancaster JetHawks]], one of the Diamondbacks' [[minor-league baseball|minor-league]] affilliates. Backman was fired after management learned of legal troubles and improprieties in Backman's past, and former [[Seattle Mariners]] manager and Giants catcher [[Bob Melvin]] became the new manager after a ten-day tenure for Backman.

Following the Backman incident, the Diamondbacks spent heavily on free agents in order to build a contender.  The club signed 3B [[Troy Glaus]], P [[Russ Ortiz]], SS [[Royce Clayton]], and 2B [[Craig Counsell]], among others. Then, they traded [[Randy Johnson]] to the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]], while acquiring [[Javier Vazquez]], [[Brad Halsey]] and [[Shawn Green]] in a three-team trade that included the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]], and sent [[Shea Hillenbrand]] to the [[Toronto Blue Jays|Blue Jays]].  Finally, they traded [[Casey Fossum]] to the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays|Devil Rays]] for [[José Cruz, Jr.]].

The Diamondbacks, led by Melvin, finished the 2005 season with a disappointing record of 77 wins and 85 losses. However, this was actually good enough for second place in the woefully weak NL West, five games behind the [[San Diego Padres]]. 

The Diamondbacks were considered by some to be the favorite to win the division after spending big money on the aforementioned free agents; however, injuries hurt the team's chances of reaching its expected potential.

Starting pitcher [[Russ Ortiz|Ortiz]] was out for some time which really hurt the pitching staff. [[Troy Glaus|Glaus]] played with a hurt knee all season. Of all the free agents that signed before the season, no one had a better season than first baseman [[Tony Clark]]. Clark started the season as a bench player and ended the season starting and being an important part of the team. Clark was rewarded with a new contract at the end of the season.

In [[October]] [[2005]] the Diamondbacks hired 35 year old [[Josh Byrnes]] to replace the out-going Joe Garagiola, Jr. as [[General Manager]]. Garagiola took a position in [[Major League Baseball]]'s main offices in New York City.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aesthetics''' is the study or philosophy of beauty. 

==Definition==
The noun ''aesthetic'' means &quot;that which appeals to the senses&quot;. Thus, the aesthetics of mathematics are the properties of mathematics that appeal to the senses, as opposed to the content, structures, and utility of the science itself.

Aesthetics is also the domain of philosophy that ponders beauty and art. An aesthetic (also ''esthetic'' or ''æsthetic'') is the concept of a particular school of philosophy that appraises beauty and art by certain standards, e.g. ''the aesthetic of minimalism''.

The adverb ''aesthetically'' signifies a sensory effect. Aesthetically pleasing sculptures, therefore, are scupltures that please the senses. 

''Aesthetics'' derives from the German ''Ästhetik'' or French ''esthétique'', both from the Greek ''αἰσθητική'', meaning a perceiver or a sensitive person. The word ''Aesthetics'' was not widely used in English until the beginning of the 19th Century, as referenced by J. H. Bernard's 1892 translation of Immanuel Kant's ''the Critique of the Power of Judgment''.

==Aesthetics in history and philosophy==
{{main|History of aesthetics (pre-20th-century)}}

Although thinkers and sages have pondered beauty and art for thousands of years, the subject of Aesthetics wasn’t set apart as an independent philosophical discipline until the 18th Century by German philosophers. Before this period authors viewed the study as inseparable from other main topics, such as ethics in the Western tradition and religion in the Eastern tradition.

===Ancient Greece===
Greek philosophers initially felt that aesthetically appealing objects were beautiful in and of themselves. [[Plato]] felt that beautiful objects incorporated proportion, harmony and unity among their parts.  Similarly in the &quot;Metaphysics&quot; [[Aristotle]] found that the universal elements of beauty were order, symmetry, and definiteness.

===18th and 19th Century Europe===
In 1750 the German philosopher [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] published the book &quot;Aesthetica&quot; in which he took the term to mean &quot;criticism of taste&quot;. Baumgarten reduced taste to an intellectual act, ignoring the element of feeling. Baumgarten concluded that nature is the highest embodiment of beauty, and that art must seek its supreme function in the strictest possible imitation of nature.  Despite interpretations by later philosophers to approach sensuality and feeling, Baumgarten's definition has survived as an important part of [[critical theory]].[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=aesthetic] 

In his 1790 book &quot;Critique of Judgment,&quot; [[Immanuel Kant]] called Aesthetics &quot;the science which treats of the conditions of sensuous perception&quot;.  Kant emphasized beauty, taste, transcendence, and the sublime. Beautiful art might fall into the category of what we think of today as pretty, pleasant, or pleasing to the eye. Sublime images on the other hand were awe-inspiring. Dramatic scenes from nature such as vast mountainscapes, the dazzling sea, or light shining through forested trees might produce an experience of the sublime. Kant insisted that aesthetic judgment is always singular, of the form &quot;This rose is beautiful.&quot; He denied that we can reach a valid universal aesthetic judgment of the form &quot;All objects possessing such and such qualities are beautiful.&quot; 

The German [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel]] and later French philosophers J. Cousin and Jean Charles Leveque developed an elaborate system of aesthetics regarding it as spiritual in nature. The several beautiful characteristics of an organic body (the principal ones of magnitude, unity and variety of parts, intensity of color, grace or flexibility, and correspondence to the environment) may be brought under the ideal grandeur and order of the species. These are perceived by reason to be the manifestations of an invisible vital force. Similarly the beauties of inorganic nature were to be viewed as the grand and orderly displays of an immaterial physical force. Thus all beauty was in its objective essence either spirit or unconscious force acting with fullness and in order.

===Modern Philosophy===
The field of aesthetics has enjoyed a rebirth in recent years. Post-WWII Modern art -- particularly up through the 1980s -- strongly reacted against notions of beauty. Some theorists (Hal Foster) have described this as an &quot;anti-aesthetic.&quot; Since artistic media were deconstructed and explored to their very foundational or essential elements, creating an aesthetically beautiful work was no longer the key. Instead, artists focused on conceptual questions such as 'what is art?' or 'who defines art?' For instance, the artist Joseph Beuys used materials such as heavy dark felt, dirt, logs, bones and sticks, all of which might be considered to be quite &quot;ugly&quot; by traditional understandings of beauty and aesthetics.

Art today might be said to be more embracing, or at least better engaged with current notions of the beautiful or sublime. Theorists such as Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe have discussed how the intensification of capitalism and new technologies might be developing a new notion of sublimity. Visual culture theorist Johanna Drucker proposed that contemporary artists recognize their complicity with the dominant ideologies of beauty and aesthetics, and may both critique and embrace these aesthetics simultaneously.

==Aesthetics in the arts==
===Visual arts===
Aesthetic considerations within the visual arts are usually associated with the sense of vision. A painting or sculpture however is also perceived spatially by recognized associations and context, and even to some extent by the senses of smell, hearing, and touch. The form of the work can be subject to an aesthetic as much as the content.

In painting, the aesthetic convention that we see a three-dimensional representation rather than a two-dimensional canvas is so well understood that most people do not realize that they are making an aesthetic interpretation. This notion is the basis of [[abstract impressionism]].

Some aesthetic effects available in visual arts include variation, juxtaposition, repetition, field effects, symmetry/asymmetry, perceived mass, subliminal structure, linear dynamics, tension and repose, pattern, contrast, perspective, 3 dimensionality, movement, rhythm, unity/Gestalt, matrixiality and proportion.

===Music===
{{main|Aesthetics of music}}

[[Music]] can affect our emotions, our intellect, our body and our psychology; lyrics can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. As such, music is a powerful art form with an aesthetic appeal that is highly dependent upon the culture in which it is practiced.

Some of the aesthetic elements expressed in music include lyricism, harmony, hypnotism, emotiveness, temporal dynamics, volume dynamics, resonance, playfulness, color, subtlety, depth, and mood (see [[Musical development]]).  Aesthetics in music are highly sensitive to their context: what sounds good in modern American rock would sound terrible in the context of the early baroque age.

===Performing arts===
[[Theater|Performing arts]] appeal to our aesthetics of storytelling, grace, balance, class, timing, strength, shock, humor, costume, irony, beauty, drama, suspense, and sensuality. Whereas live stage performance is usually constrained by the physical reality at hand, film performance can further add the aesthetic elements of large-scale action, fantasy, and a complex interwoven musical [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|score]].

===Literature===
Encompassing [[poetry]], [[Short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s and [[non-fiction]], authors use a variety of techniques to appeal to our aesthetic values. Depending on the type of writing an author may employ rhythm, illustrations, structure, time shifting, juxtaposition, dualism, imagery, fantasy, suspense, analysis, humor/cynicism, and thinking aloud.

In literary aesthetics, the study of &quot;affect&quot; illuminates the deep structures of reading and receiving literary works. These affects may be broadly grouped by their mode of writing and the relationship that the reader assumes with time. Catharsis is the affect of dramatic completion of action in time. Kairosis is the affect of novels whose characters become integrated in time. Kenosis is the affect of lyric poetry which creates a sense of emptiness and timelessness.

===Gastronomy===
Although [[Culinary|food]] is a basic and frequently experienced commodity, careful attention to the aesthetic possibilities of foodstuffs can turn eating into gastronomy. Chefs inspire our aesthetic enjoyment through the visual sense using color and arrangement; they inspire our senses of taste and smell using [[spices]], diversity/contrast, anticipation, seduction, and decoration/garnishes.

==Aesthetics in the sciences==
===Information technology===
Aesthetics in information technology has focused upon the study of human-computer interaction and creating user-friendly devices and software applications; aesthetically pleasing &quot;graphical user interfaces&quot; have been shown to improve productivity. Software itself has aesthetic dimensions (&quot;software aesthetics&quot;), as do information-technology-mediated processes and experiences such as computer video games and virtual reality simulations. [[Digital culture]] is a distinct aesthetic to judge the appeal of digital environments such as browsers, websites, and icons, as well as visual and aural art produced exclusively with digital technologies.  

===Mathematics===
{{main|Mathematical beauty}}

The aesthetics of [[mathematics]] are often compared with music and poetry. Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] expressed his views on the indescribable beauty of mathematics when he said &quot;Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony beautiful.&quot; Math appeals to the &quot;senses&quot; of logic, order, novelty, elegance, and discovery.  Some concepts in math with specific aesthetic application include sacred ratios in Geometry, the intuitiveness of axioms, the complexity and intrigue of fractals, the solidness and regularity of polyhedra, and the serendipity of relating theorems across disciplines.

===Neuroesthetics===
[[Cognitive science]] has also considered aesthetics, with the advent of [[neuroesthetics]], pioneered by [[Semir Zeki]], which seeks to explain the prominence of great art as an embodiment of biological principles of the brain, namely that great works of art capture the essence of things just as vision and the brain capture the essentials of the world from the ever-changing stream of sensory input.

==Aesthetics in engineering==
===Industrial design===
Beyond providing functional characteristics, designers heed many aesthetic qualities to improve the marketability of manufactured products: smoothness, shininess/reflectivity, texture, pattern, curviness, color, simplicity (or usability), velocity, symmetry, naturalness, and modernism.

===Architecture and Interior Design===
Although structural integrity, cost, the nature of building materials, and the functional utility of the building contribute heavily to the design process, architects can still apply aesthetic considerations to buildings and related [[architecture|architectural]] structures.  Common aesthetic design principles include ornamentation, edge delineation, texture, flow, solemnity, symmetry, color, granularity, the interaction of sunlight and shadows, transcendence, and harmony.

Interior Designers, being less constrained by structural concerns, have a wider variety of applications to appeal to aesthetics.  They may employ color, color harmony, wallpaper, ornamentation, furnishings, fabrics, textures, lighting, various floor treatments, as well as adhere to aesthetic concepts such as feng-shui.

===Urban life===
Nearly half of mankind lives in cities; although it represents a lofty goal, [[Urban planning|planning]] and achieving urban aesthetics ([[beautification]]) involves a good deal of historical luck, happenstance, and indirect gestalt. Nevertheless aesthetically pleasing cities share certain traits: ethnic and cultural variety, numerous microclimates that promote a diversity of vegetation, sufficient public transportation, a range of build-out (or zoning) that creates both densely and sparsely populated areas, sanitation to foster clean streets and graffiti removal, scenic neighboring geography (oceans or mountains), public spaces and events such as parks and parades, musical variety through local radio or street musicians, and enforcement of laws that abate noise, crime, and pollution.

===Landscape design===
[[Landscape architecture|Landscape designers]] draw upon design elements such as axis, line, landform, horizontal and vertical planes, texture, and scale to create aesthetic variation within the landscape. They may additionally make use of aesthetic elements such as pools or fountains of water, plants, seasonal variance, stonework, fragrance, exterior lighting, statues, and lawns.

==Schools of aesthetics==
Different schools of philosophy have different aesthetics from each other.  Some of them are:
* [[Cool (African philosophy)]]
* Japanese [[Iki (aesthetic ideal)]]
*[[Humanistic Aestheticism]]

The '''Ark of the Covenant''' (ארון הברית in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''aron habrit'') is described in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as a sacred container built at the command of [[Moses]], wherein rested the [[stone tablets]] containing the [[Ten Commandments]]. The Ark and its sanctuary were &quot;the beauty of Israel&quot; ([[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 2:1). 

During the journeys of the Israelites, the Ark was carried by the priests in advance of the host ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 4:5, 6; 10:33-36; [[Psalms]] 68:1; 132:8). The Ark was borne by priests into the bed of the [[Jordan River|Jordan]], which separated, opening a pathway for the whole of the host to pass over ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 3:15, 16; 4:7, 10, 11, 17, 18). The Ark was moreover borne in the procession round [[Jericho]] (Josh. 6:4, 6, 8, 11, 12). When carried, the Ark was always wrapped in a veil, in badger skins, a blue cloth, and was carefully concealed, even from the eyes of the [[Levite]]s who carried it.

==Terminology==

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''aron'' is used in the Bible to designate any type of ark, chest or coffer, for any purpose ([[Genesis]] 50:26; [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 12:9, 10). The Ark of the Covenant is distinguished from all others by such titles as &quot;Ark of God&quot; ([[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 3:3), &quot;Ark of the Covenant&quot; (Josh. 3:6; [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 9:4), &quot;Ark of the Testimony&quot; (Ex. 25:22).

The Ark is referred to by several names in the Bible. The following is a list of common references to the Ark:
*The Ark 
*The Ark of the [[Testimony]]
*The Ark of the [[Covenant (Israel)|Covenant]]
*The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord
*The Ark wherein is the Covenant of the Lord, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the [[Egypt|Land of Egypt]] 
*The Ark wherein is the Covenant of the Lord, that he made with the [[Children of Israel]]
*The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth
*The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of Hosts, who dwelleth between the [[cherubim]]
*The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God
*The Ark of the Covenant of God
*The Ark of the Lord 
*The Ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the Earth
*The Ark of the Lord God 
*The Ark of the Lord God of Israel
*The Ark of the Lord your God
*The Ark of God
*The Ark of our God
*The Ark of the God of Israel
*The Ark of God which is called by the Name, the name of the Lord of hosts who dwelleth between the cherubim
*The Ark of God, the Lord, who dwelleth between the cherubim, which is called the Name
*The Holy Ark 
*The Ark of thy God's strength

==Description==
[[Image:arkofthecovenantatkingtutstomb.jpg|thumb|191px|The ''Ark of the Covenant'' may have looked similar to this chest (found in the [[Tutankhamun|Tomb of Tutankhamun]]).]] 

The Bible describes the Ark as made of [[acacia]] or [[shittah-tree]] wood. It was a [[cubit]] and a half broad and high and two cubits long (about 130 × 80 × 80 cm). The Ark was covered all over with the purest [[gold]]. Its upper surface or lid, the [[mercy seat]], was surrounded with a rim of gold. 

On each of the two sides were two gold rings, wherein were placed [[Staff (stick)|two wooden poles]] (with a decorative sheathing of gold), with which the ark could be carried (Num. 7:9; 10:21; 4:5,19, 20; 1 Kings 8:3, 6). Over the Ark, at the two extremities, were two [[cherubim]], with their faces turned toward one another ([[Leviticus]] 16:2; Num. 7:89). Their outspread wings over the top of the ark formed the throne of God, while the ark itself was his footstool (Ex. 25:10-22; 37:1-9). The Ark was deposited in the &quot;[[Most Holy Place|Holy of Holies]],&quot; and was placed so that one end of the carrying poles  touched the veil separating the two compartments of the tabernacle (1 Kings 8:8). 

===Contents===

According to the Bible, the two tablets of stone constituting the &quot;testimony&quot; or evidence of God's [[covenant]] with the people ([[Deuteronomy]] 31:26) were kept within the Ark itself. The [[Tanakh]] states in I Kings 8:9 that there &quot;was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone&quot;. Some see this as contradictory with other verses, claiming the presence of the &quot;pot of manna&quot; (Ex. 16:34), and &quot;[[Aaron]]'s rod that budded&quot; before the Ark (Heb. 9:4 - in the Ark). The items were placed &quot;before the Ark with the testimony&quot;; the correct meaning of that phrase is open to interpretation.

===Sanctity and consecration===

Even Aaron, brother of Moses and the [[High Priest]], was forbidden to enter the place of the Ark too often. He was enjoined to enter the [[Holy of Holies]] only once per year on a designated day, and to perform certain ceremonies there (Lev. 16). Moses was directed to consecrate the Ark, when completed, with the oil of holy ointment (Ex. 30:23-26); and he was also directed to have the Ark made by [[Bezaleel]], son of [[Uri_%28Bible%29|Uri]] of the [[tribe of Judah]], and by [[Aholiab]], the son of [[Ahisamach]] of the [[tribe of Dan]] (Ex. 31:2-7). These instructions Moses carried out, calling upon &quot;every wisehearted&quot; one among the people to assist in the work (Ex. 35:10-12). Bezaleel the artist made the Ark (Ex. 37:1); and Moses approved the work, put the testimony in the Ark, and installed it.

In Deut. 10:1-5 a different account of the making of the Ark is given. Moses is made to say that he constructed the Ark before going upon [[Mount Sinai]] to receive the second set of tablets. The charge of carrying the Ark and the rest of the holy implements was given to the family of [[Kohath]] (of the [[tribe of Levi]]). They, though, were not to touch any of the holy things that were still uncovered by Aaron (Num. 4:2-15).

==Prophets' mentions==

The Ark of the Covenant is mentioned by [[prophet]]s in both the Bible and the [[Qur'an]].

===In the Bible===
[[Image:Folio_29r_-_The_Ark_of_God_Carried_into_the_Temple.jpg|180px|thumb|The Ark carried into the Temple]]
The only mention of the Ark in the books of the prophets is the reference to it by [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]], who, speaking in the days of [[Josiah]] (Jer. 3:16), prophesies a time when the Ark will no longer be needed because of the righteousness of the people. In the [[Psalms]], the Ark is twice referred to. In Ps. 78:61 its capture by the Philistines is spoken of, and the Ark is called &quot;the strength and glory of God&quot;; and in Ps. 132:8, it is spoken of as &quot;the ark of the strength of the Lord.&quot; 

The Ark is mentioned in one passage in the [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] 2 Maccabees 2:4-10, which contains a reference to a document saying that the prophet Jeremiah, &quot;being warned of God,&quot; took the Ark, and the tabernacle, and the altar of incense, and buried them in a cave on Mount Nebo (Deut 34:1), informing those of his followers who wished to find the place that it should remain unknown &quot;until the time that God should gather His people again together, and receive them unto mercy.&quot; Hebrews 9:4 states that the Ark contained &quot;the golden pot that had ''[[manna]]'', and [[Aaron's rod]] that budded, and the tables of the covenant.&quot; Finally, in Revelation 11:19, the Ark is described as being in heaven, just before the woman clothed with the sun appears ([[Book of Revelation]] 12).

===In the Qur'an===

There is only a brief mention of the Ark of the Covenant in the [[Qur'an]]:
: ''Their prophet said to them, &quot;The sign of his kingship is that the Ark of the Covenant will be restored to you, bringing assurances from your Lord, and relics left by the people of Moses and the people of Aaron. It will be carried by the angels. This should be a convincing sign for you, if you are really believers.&quot;''&lt;br /&gt;''[[wikisource:The_Holy_Qur%27an/Al-Baqara|002:248]]''
According to some Muslim scholars, the Ark of the Covenant does not have a religious basis in [[Islam]] and Islam does not give it any special significance while others believe that it will be found by [[Mahdi]] near the [[Qiyamah|end of times]]. These Islamic scholars believe inside there will be relics left by the people of [[Moses]] and the people of [[Aaron]]. There might be the [[sceptre]]s of Moses (eg., [[Nehushtan]]), Aaron's rod, Plates of the [[Torah]], and Aaron's turban.

==History==

===Mobile vanguard===
In the march from Sinai, and at the crossing of the [[Jordan river|Jordan]], the Ark preceded the people, and was the signal for their advance (Num. 10:33; Josh. 3:3, 6). The Ark of the Covenant burned the thorns and other obstructions in the wilderness roads. According to tradition, [[spark]]s from between the two cherubim killed [[snake|serpent]]s and [[scorpion]]s. (Canticles iii) {{ref|JewishEncyclopedia}} During the crossing of the Jordan, the river grew dry as soon as the feet of the priests carrying the Ark touched its waters; and remained so until the priests -- with the Ark -- left the river, after the people had passed over (Josh. 3:15-17; 4:10, 11, 18). As memorials, [[twelve stones]] were taken from the Jordan at the place where the priests had stood (Josh. 4:1-9).

The Ark was carried into battle, such as in the [[Midian war]] (Num. 31). During the ceremonies preceding the capture of [[Jericho]], the Ark was carried round the city in the daily procession, preceded by the armed men and by seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns (Josh. 6:6-15). After the defeat at [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]], [[Joshua]] lamented before the Ark (Josh. 7:6-9). When Joshua read the Law to the people between [[Mount Gerizim]] and [[Mount Ebal]], they stood on each side of the Ark. The Ark was again set up by Joshua at [[Shiloh (Biblical)|Shiloh]]; but when the Israelites fought against Benjamin at [[Gibeah]], they had the Ark with them, and consulted it after their defeat.

===Captured by the Philistines===

The Ark is next spoken of as being in the [[tabernacle]] at [[Shiloh (Biblical)|Shiloh]] during Samuel's apprenticeship (1 Sam. 3:3). After the settlement of the [[Israelites]] in [[Canaan]], the ark remained in the tabernacle at [[Gilgal]] for a season, then was removed to Shiloh until the time of [[Eli (Judges)|Eli]], between 300 and 400 years ([[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 7:12), when it was carried into the field of battle, so as to secure, as they supposed, victory to the Hebrews; and it was taken by the [[Philistines]] (1 Sam. 4:3-11), who sent it back after retaining it seven months (1 Sam. 5:7, 8) because of the events said to have transpired.  After their first defeat at [[Eben-ezer]], the Israelites had the Ark brought from Shiloh, and welcomed its coming with great rejoicing. 

In the second battle, the Israelites were again defeated, and the Philistines captured the Ark (1 Sam. 4:3-5, 10, 11). The news of its capture was at once taken to Shiloh by a messenger &quot;with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.&quot; The old priest, Eli, fell dead when he heard it; and his daughter-in-law, bearing a son at the time the news of the capture of the Ark was received, named him [[Ichabod]]&amp;#8212;explained as &quot;Where is glory?&quot; in reference to the loss of the Ark (1 Sam. 4:12-22).

The Philistines took the Ark to several places in their country, and at each place misfortune resulted to them (1 Sam. 5:1-6). At [[Ashdod]] it was placed in the temple of [[Dagon]]. The next morning Dagon was found prostrate, bowed down, before it; and on being restored to his place, he was on the following morning again found prostrate and broken. The people of Ashdod were smitten with boils; a plague of mice was sent over the land (1 Sam. 6:5). The affliction of boils was also visited upon the people of [[Gath]] and of [[Ekron]], whither the Ark was successively removed (1 Sam. 5:8-12).

After the Ark had been among them seven months, the Philistines, on the advice of their diviners, returned it to the Israelites, accompanying its return with an offering consisting of golden images of the boils and mice wherewith they had been afflicted. The Ark was set in the field of Joshua the [[Beth-shemite]], and the Beth-shemites offered sacrifices and burnt offerings (1 Sam. 6:1-15). Out of curiosity the men of [[Beth-shemesh]] gazed at the Ark; and as a punishment over fifty thousand of them were smitten by the Lord (1 Sam. 6:19). The Bethshemites sent to [[Kirjath-jearim]], or Baal-Judah, to have the Ark removed (1 Sam. 6:21); and it was taken to the house of [[Abinadab]], whose son [[Eleazar]] was sanctified to keep it. Kirjath-jearim was the abode of the Ark for twenty years. Under Saul, the Ark was with the army before he first met the Philistines, but the king was too impatient to consult it before engaging in battle. In [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 13:3 it is stated that the people were not accustomed to consult the Ark in the days of [[Saul]].

===In the days of King David===

At the very beginning of his reign, [[David]] removed the Ark from Kirjath-jearim amid great rejoicing. On the way to [[Zion]], [[Uzzah]], one of the drivers of the cart whereon the Ark was carried, put out his hand to steady the Ark, and was smitten by the Lord for touching it. David, in fear, carried the Ark aside into the house of [[Obed-edom]] the [[Gittite]], instead of carrying it on to Zion, and here it stayed three months (2 Sam. 6:1-11; 1 Chron. 13:1-13).

On hearing that the Lord had blessed Obed-edom because of the presence of the Ark in his house, David had the Ark brought to Zion by the Levites, while he himself, &quot;girded with a linen [[ephod]],&quot; &quot;danced before the Lord with all his might&quot;&amp;#8212;a performance for which he was despised and scornfully rebuked by Saul's daughter [[Michal]] (2 Sam. 6:12-16, 20-22; 1 Chron. 15). This unjustified derision on her part resulted in the permanent loss of her fertility.  In Zion, David put the Ark in the tabernacle he had prepared for it, offered sacrifices, distributed food, and blessed the people and his own household (2 Sam. 6:17-20; 1 Chron. 16:1-3; 2 Chron. 1:4).

Levites were appointed to minister before the Ark (1 Chron. 16:4). David's plan of building a temple for the Ark was stopped at the advice of God (2 Sam. 7:1-17; 1 Chron. 17:1-15; 28:2, 3). The Ark was with the army during the siege of [[Rabbah]] (2 Sam. 11:11); and when David fled from Jerusalem at the time of [[Absalom]]'s conspiracy, the Ark was carried along with him until he ordered [[Zadok]] the priest to return it to Jerusalem (2 Sam. 15:24-29).

===In Solomon's Temple===

When [[Abiathar]] was dismissed from the priesthood by Solomon for having taken part in [[Adonijah]]'s [[conspiracy]] against David, his life was spared because he had formerly borne the Ark (1 Kings 2:26). It was afterwards placed by [[Solomon]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|temple]] (1 Kings 8:6-9). Solomon worshiped before the Ark after his dream in which the Lord promised him wisdom (1 Kings 3:15). In [[Solomon's Temple]], a Holy of Holies was prepared to receive the Ark (1 Kings 6:19); and when the Temple was dedicated, the Ark -- containing nothing but the two Mosaic tables of stone -- was placed therein. When the priests emerged from the holy place after placing the Ark there, the Temple was filled with a cloud, &quot;for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord&quot; (1 Kings 8:10-11; 2 Chron. 5:13, 14). 

When Solomon married Pharaoh's daughter, he caused her to dwell in a house outside Zion, as Zion was consecrated because of its containing the Ark (2 Chron. 8:11). King Josiah had the Ark put into the Temple (2 Chron. 35:3), whence it appears to have again been removed by one of his successors.

===The Babylonians and afterwards===

When the [[Babylonia]]ns destroyed Jerusalem and plundered the temple, the Ark entered the domain of legend. Many historians suppose that the ark was probably taken away by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]] and destroyed.  The absence of the ark from the [[Second Temple]] was acknowledged.

==Fate of the Ark==

In contrast to the general consensus of historians (that supposes that the ark was taken away and destroyed), variant traditions about the ultimate fate of the Ark include the intentional concealing of the Ark under the [[Temple Mount]], the removal of the Ark from Jerusalem in advance of the Babylonians (this variant usually ends up with the Ark in [[Ethiopia]]), the removal of the Ark by the Ethiopian prince [[Menelik I]] (purported son of [[King Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]]), removal by Jewish priests during the reign of [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh of Judah]], possibly taken to a Jewish temple on Elephantine in Egypt, and the miraculous removal of the Ark by divine intervention (C.f. 2 Chronicles).

===Concealment===

Some believe that the Ark of the Covenant and the Tabernacle of the Lord was hidden. This is referenced by four separate sources:
# the Mishnayot of Rabbi Hertz
# the Marble Tablets of Beirut
# the Copper Scroll
# the ancient Ben Ezra Synagogue sacred texts.

====Mishnayot====
The Mishnayot introduction included ancient records that Rabbi Hertz called the &quot;''[[Mishnayot]]''&quot;. Hertz used the term &quot;Mishnayot&quot;, since the text of the ''Mishnayot'' is missing from the [[Mishnah]] (''Mishna''), which is the first section of the [[Talmud]], a collection of ancient [[Rabbinic]] writings including also the [[Gemara]], &quot;the summary&quot;, and containing the [[Jewish]] [[religious law]].  {{ref|Mock}}

The &quot;missing&quot; [[Mishnaic]] text in the Mishnayot is called the ''[[Massakhet Keilim]]'', written in twelve chapters. Each chapter of the Mishnayot describes vessels which were hidden under the direction of [[Jeremiah]] the Prophet by five holy men ([[Shimor HaLevi]], [[Chizkiah]], [[Tzidkiyahu]], [[Haggai]] the Prophet and [[Zechariah]] the Prophet), seven years prior to the destruction of Solomon's First Temple, because the dangers of Babylonian conquest were imminent. The Mishnayot describing this hiding was then written in Babylon during the Babylonian Captivity.

The first chapter of the Mishnayot describes the vessels that were hidden - including the ''Ark of the Covenant'' and the Tabernacle of the Lord, i.e. the Mishkan, the Tablets of [[Moses]], the altar (with cherubim) for the daily and seasonal sacrifices (the ushebtis), the [[Menorah]] (candelabra), the [[Qalal]] (copper urn) containing the Ashes of the [[Red Heifer]] (ashes from a red cow sacrificed under Moses, necessary for ritual purification of the priests), and numerous vessels of the [[Kohanim]] (priests).

The second chapter of the Mishnayot states that a list of these treasures was inscribed upon a copper tablet. This is the Copper Scroll found at Qumran.

====Marble Tablets of Beirut====

In 1952 two large marble tablets were found in the basement of a museum in [[Beirut]], stating they were the words of Shimor HaLevi, the servant of HaShem, and the writing on the tablets is the entire missing text of &quot;Massakhet Keilim&quot; (''Mishnayot'') including reference to the Copper Scroll. 

====Copper Scroll====

The first of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] was discovered in 1947, and the famed [[Copper Scroll]] - made of pure copper - was found at [[Qumran]] in 1952. The Copper Scroll is an inventory - written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] - of treasures, thought by some to be from [[Solomon]]'s First Temple, hidden before the destruction of that temple by the [[Babylonians]] and treasures which have not been seen since. 

The Copper Scroll states that a silver [or alabaster?] chest, the vestments of the [[Cohen Gadol]] ([[Hebrews|Hebrew]] [[High Priest]]), gold and silver in great quantities, the [[Tabernacle|Tabernacle of the Lord]] (perhaps the [[Mishkan]]) and many treasures were hidden in a desolate valley - under a hill - on its east side, forty stones deep. The Mishkan was a &quot;portable&quot; Temple for the ''Ark of the Covenant''. The writings in the Copper Scroll were confirmed 40 years later in the 1990s through an ancient text found in the introduction to ''Emeq HaMelekh'' (&quot;Valley of the King(s)&quot;) -- a book published in 1648 in Amsterdam, Holland, by [[Rabbi Naftali Hertz Ben Ya’acov Elchanon]] (Rabbi Hertz).

====Ben Ezra synagogue texts====

Work in the 1990s showed that in 1896, almost one hundred years previous, [[Solomon Schechter]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in [[England]] had acquired 100,000 pages of ancient Hebrew texts from the [[Genizah]] (repository for aged sacred Jewish texts) of the Ben [[Ezra]] [[Synagogue]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. A copy of the &quot;[[Tosefta]]&quot; (supplement to the Mishnah) was found in these texts, included among the text on [[Keilim]] (vessels). This &quot;Tosefta&quot; is the same text as cited by Rabbi Hertz as his source for the Mishnayot.

== Where is it now? ==
Some have claimed to have possession or discovered the Ark.
===Middle East===
In 1989, the late [[Ron Wyatt]] claimed to have broken into a chamber while digging underground beneath Mount Moriah, also known as The Temple Mount. He claimed to have seen the ark and taken photographs. All photos came out blurry (leading to skepticism of the claim). According to Wyatt the excavations were closed off (because of private property concerns) and, to the extent of knowledge, no one has seen the ark since. Ron Wyatt was widely seen in the Biblical archeology community as an attention seeker, often announcing he had found Biblically important objects with little or no hard evidence to back up his claims.

[[Vendyl Jones]] claimed to have found the entrance to the chamber in the cave of the Column - Qumran. Here, he stated, is where the Ark was hidden prior to the destruction of the First Temple. Arutz Sheva quoted Jones stating he would reveal the ark on [[Tisha B'Av]] ([[August 14]], [[2005]]), the anniversary of the destruction of both the First and Second Temples. {{ref|Robins}} However, this did not occur. On Jones' website he states that he was misquoted and actually said it would be appropriate if he discovered the ark on Tisha B'Av. Jones is waiting for funding to explore the cave.

Modern excavations near the Temple Mount in Jerusalem have found tunnels, but digging beneath the Temple Mount is somewhat restricted. One of the most important Islamic shrines, the [[Dome of the Rock]], sits in the location where the Temple Mount in Jerusalem once stood. [[Ron Wyatt]] claimed he felt it unwise to fully excavate the Ark for a variety of reasons, including bloody ownership disputes and divine inspiration.

===Africa===
Some sources suggest that during the reign of King Manasseh (2 Chron 33) the Ark was smuggled from the temple by way of the [[Well of souls]] and taken to Egypt, eventually ending up in Ethiopia.  There are some carvings on the [[Cathedral of Chartres]] that may refer to this. 
[[Image:Ark_of_the_Covenant_church_in_Axum_Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Chapel of the Tablet at the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] allegedly houses the original ''Ark of the Covenant''.]]
====Ethiopian Orthodox Church====
The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] in [[Axum, Ethiopia]] claims to still possess the Ark of the Covenant. Local tradition maintains that it was brought to [[Ethiopia]] by [[Menelik I]] following a visit to his father King Solomon. Although it was once paraded before the town once each year, it is now kept under constant guard in a &quot;treasury&quot; near the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]], and only the head priest of the church is allowed to view it. Most Western historians are skeptical of this claim.

Dr Bernard Leeman, in his 2005 book &quot;Queen of Sheba and Biblical Scholarship&quot; (Queensland Academic Press) accepts the Ethiopian traditions. He argues that the Ge'ez narrative of the Sheba-Menelik Cycle of the Kebra Nagast supports the case that ancient Judah was in west Arabia not Palestine and that Menelik's escape with the Ark follows landmarks and place names in Asir,Yemen, and Eritrea. Secondly Leeman draws attention to the Ark culture of Arabia (detailed in Munro-Hay and Grierson's works), the &quot;Hebrewisms&quot; in the Ancient West Arabian language, the word for Ark in Ge'ez (which is taken from pre-Babylonian captivity Hebrew), inscriptions in Sabaean near Mekele that speak of Hebrew resident there ca. 800 BCE ruled by three queens of Sheba, and the continued presence in the region of a Hebraic remnant group, the Ibro (or Yibir) of northern Somalia.

====Valley of Kings====
[[Andis Kaulins]] claims that the hiding place of the ark, said specifically by ancient sources (such as the [[Mishnayot]]), to be
: &quot;''a desolate valley under a hill - on its east side, forty stones deep''&quot;.
Today, it is believed by some that this refers to the Tomb of Tutankhamun (east side of the Valley of Kings, ca. forty stones deep).  Some believe that what was found there are the described treasures, including the Mishkan and the Ark of the Covenant.{{ref|Kaulins}}

==Media references==
The Ark of the Covenant was the focus of the highly popular 1981 adventure film, ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''. The plot suggests that [[Adolf Hitler]], deeply interested in supernatural power and the [[occult]], wants to acquire the Ark in order to rule the world. Intrepid archaeologist [[Indiana Jones]] opposes the Nazis and succeeds in keeping it from them. The Ark is shown to be extremely powerful, and dangerous to those who do not understand it. Jones wants to study the Ark, but it is last seen being boxed up and stored in a vast U.S. [[Government Warehouse|government warehouse]] - presumably never to be seen again.

A first season episode of the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' uses the Ark as a [[plot device]]. In &quot;The Royal Couple of Thieves&quot;, Xena recruits the [[Autolycus|King Of Thieves]] to assist her in stealing the Ark from a profiteering warlord.  Xena returns it to its rightful people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Otheruses|Germanic people}}

'''Angles''' (German: ''Angeln'', Old English: ''Englas'', Latin: singular ''Anglus'', plural ''Anglii'') were [[Germanic people]], from [[Angeln]] in [[Schleswig]], who settled in [[East Anglia]], [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]] in the [[5th century]].  Southern and eastern [[Great Britain]] was later called ''Engla-lond'' (in [[Old English language|Old English]], &quot;Land of the Angles&quot;), thus [[England]]. For the rulers of the Angles prior to their migration to Great Britain, see [[List of kings of the Angles]].

== Early history  ==
Possibly the first instance of the Angles in recorded history is in [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', chapter 40, in which the ''Anglii'' are mentioned in passing in a list of Germanic tribes.  He gives no precise indication of their geographical position, but states that, together with six other tribes, including the Varini (the [[Warni]] of later times), they worshipped a goddess named [[Nerthus]], whose sanctuary was situated on &quot;an island in the Ocean.&quot;  [[Ptolemy]] in his ''Geography'' (ii. 11. § 15), half a century later, locates them with more precision between the [[Rhine]], or rather perhaps the [[Ems]], and the [[Elbe]], and speaks of them as one of the chief tribes of the interior.  Unfortunately, however, it is clear from a comparison of his map with the evidence furnished by Tacitus and other Roman writers that the indications which he gives cannot be correct.  Owing to the uncertainty of these passages there has been much speculation regarding the original home of the Angli.  One theory, which however has little to recommend it, is that they dwelt in the basin of the [[Saale]] (in the neighbourhood of the canton [[Engilin]]), from which region the ''Lex Angliorum et Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum'' is believed by  many to have come.  At the present time the majority of scholars believe that the Angli had lived from the beginning on the coasts of the Baltic, probably in the southern part of the Jutish peninsula.  The evidence for this view is derived partly from English and Danish traditions dealing with persons and events of the [[4th century]] (see below), and partly from the fact that striking affinities to the cult of [[Nerthus]] as described by Tacitus are to be found in Scandinavian, especially Swedish and Danish, religion.  Investigations in this subject have rendered it very probable that the island of Nerthus was Sjælland ([[Zealand]]), and it is further to be observed that the kings of Wessex traced their ancestry ultimately to a certain [[Scyld]], who is clearly to be identified with [[Skiöldr]], the mythical founder of the Danish royal family ([[Skiöldungar]]).  In English tradition this person is connected with &quot;Scedeland&quot; (pl.), i.e. [[Scandinavia]], while in Scandinavian tradition he is specially associated with the ancient royal residence at Leire in Sjælland.

There is a theory that the name of the Angles came from [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] words for &quot;narrow&quot; (compare [[German language|German]] ''eng'' = &quot;narrow&quot;), and meant &quot;the people who live beside the Narrow [Water]&quot;, i.e. beside the [[Schlei]] estuary.

[[Bede]] states that the Angli before they came to Great Britain dwelt in a land called Angulus, and similar evidence is given by the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''. King [[Alfred the Great]] and the chronicler [[Aethelweard|Æthelweard]] identified this place with the district which is now called Angel in the province of [[Schleswig]] (Slesvig), though it may then have been of greater extent, and this identification agrees very well with the indications given by Bede. Full confirmation is afforded by English and Danish traditions relating to two kings named [[Wermund]] and [[Offa]], from whom the Mercian royal family were descended, and whose exploits are connected with Angel, Schleswig and Rendsburg. Danish tradition has preserved record of two governors of Schleswig, father and son, in their service, [[Frowinus]] ([[Freawine]]) and [[Wigo]] ([[Wig]]), from whom the royal family of [[Wessex]] claimed descent. During the [[5th century]] the Angli invaded Great Britain, after which time their name does not recur on the continent except in the title of the code mentioned above.

The province of Schleswig has proved exceptionally rich in prehistoric antiquities which date apparently from the 4th and 5th centuries. Among the places where these have been found, special mention should be made of the large cremation cemetery at Borgstedterfeld, between Rendsburg and Eckernförde, which has yielded many urns and brooches closely resembling those found in heathen graves in England. Of still greater importance are the great deposits at Thorsbjaerg (in Angel) and Nydam, which contained large quantities of arms, ornaments, articles of clothing, agricultural implements, &amp;c., and in the latter case even ships. By the help of these discoveries we are able to reconstruct a fairly detailed picture of Angle civilization in the age preceding the invasion of Great Britain.

== Angle influence in Great Britain ==
According to sources such as the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]], after the invasion of Great Britain the Angles split up and founded the kingdoms of the ''Nord Angelnen'' ([[Northumbria]]), ''Ost Angelnen'' ([[East Anglia]]), and the ''Mittlere Angelnen'' ([[Mercia]]). Thanks to the major influence of the [[Saxons]], the tribes were collectively called [[Anglo-Saxon]]s by the [[Normans]].  A region of the [[United Kingdom]] is still known by the name East Anglia. 

The center of the Angle homeland in the north-eastern portion of the modern German bundesland of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], itself on the [[Jutland Peninsula]], is where the rest of that people stayed, a small peninsular form still called ''[[Angeln]]'' today and is formed as a triangle drawn roughly from modern [[Flensburg]] on the Flensburger Fjord to the [[City of Schleswig]] and then to Maasholm on the [[Schlei]] inlet.  

In any case, this small and relatively easterly geographic localisation of the original Angeln tribal group has led to one of the [[Anglo-Saxon Invasion]]'s enduring mysteries: how it is possible that the Anglo-Saxons were so frequently mentioned as colonisers of ancient Great Britain in all the ancient and medieval written sources, while evidence of the neighbouring and much more powerful Frisians' concurrent colonising activities in Great Britain has been so limited to discoveries in archeological science, and more often to logical deductions and inferences alone?  Of course, ethnic Frisians are known to have inhabited the land directly in the path of any migration route from Angeln to Great Britain (except for the long and difficult route by sea around the northern tip of Denmark), and, in fact, they also inhabited lands between the ancient Saxon domain and Great Britain; yet they are rarely mentioned as having taken part in the vast migration.

The Angles are the subject of a legend about [[Pope Gregory I]] (ca. 540–604).  As an abbreviated version of the story goes, Gregory happened to see a group of Angle children from [[Deira]] for sale as slaves in the Roman market.  Struck by the beauty of their fair-skinned complexions and bright blue eyes, Gregory inquired about their background.  When  told they were Angles, he replied with a Latin pun that translates well into English: “Non Angli, sed angeli”(&quot;Not Angles, but angels&quot;).  Supposedly, he thereafter resolved to convert their pagan homeland to Christianity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Aster CT-80''', an early [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]] developed by the small [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company MCP (later renamed to '''Aster Computers'''), was sold in its first incarnation as a kit for hobbyists. Later it was sold ready to use. It consisted of several [[Eurocard]] [[Printed circuit board|PCB]]'s and a [[backplane]]. 

Three models were sold. The first model looked like the later [[IBM PC]], a rectangular base unit with two [[floppy]] drives on the front, and a monitor on top with a separate keyboard. The second incarnation was a much smaller unit the width of two 5 1/4&quot; floppy drives stacked on top of each other, and the third incarnation looked like a flattened [[Apple II|Apple]] with a built-in keyboard.

All units ran much faster than the original [[TRS-80]], at 4 [[Megahertz|MHz]], and the display supported upper and lower case, and hardware snow suppression (video ram bus arbitration logic). The floppy disk interface supported dual density, and disk capacities up to 800 [[Kilobyte|KB]]. 

The Aster also had the unique feature of supporting two fundamentally different internal architectures: when turned on without a boot floppy, or with a TRS-DOS floppy the Aster would be fully TRS-80 compatible. But when the boot loader detected a [[CP/M]] floppy the Aster would reconfigure its internal architecture on the fly to optimally support CP/M with 60 KB free [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], and a 80 x 25 display, a capability it only shared with the [[LOBO Max-80]] another TRS-80 clone.

With a special configuration tool it could reconfigure its floppy drivers to read and write the floppies of about 80 other CP/M systems.

Most Aster CT-80's (about 10 thousand) were sold to schools for computer education, in a project first known as the &quot;honderd scholen project&quot; (one hundred schools project), but which later involved many more than just one hundred schools. MCP received this order from the Dutch government because their computer met all the demands, including the demand that the computers should be of Dutch origin and should be built in the Netherlands. Later however the Government turned around and gave 50% of the order to [[Philips]] and their [[Philips P2000|P2000]] homecomputer even though the P2000 did not meet all the demands and was made in [[Austria]].

Aster computers was based in the small town of [[Arkel]] near the town of [[Gorinchem]].
Initially Aster computer b.v. was called MCP (Music print Computer Product) and was specialised in producing computer assisted printing of sheet music. They started selling electronic kits to hobbyists. Among those kits were alternative floppy disk drives for TRS-80 computers. Because the infamous [[TRS-80 expansion interface]] was very expensive they also developed their own alternative in the form of a floppy disk controller and printer interface that could be built right into the floppy disk enclosure. The lack of RAM expansion was solved by a service in which the 16 KB RAM chips would be replaced by 64 KB ram chips.
While this went on MCP renamed itself to ''MCP CHIP'' but ran into problems with the German computer magazine CHIP, and had to return to its former name. At that time MCP did also sell imported home computers like the TRS-80, and the Apple.

After designing their own fully functional replacement for the TRS-80 expansion interface (which was never commercialised) the company decided that the TRS-80 was a great computer but it lacked in several areas. The display logic and resulting display 'snow' was bothersome, the CPU speed could be improved, and the floppy disk capacity and reliability was low. Also the more interesting software offered for CP/M systems was lacking. So they decided they could do better and designed the Aster CT-80.

Soon the little shop became too small and they moved to a much larger factory building nearby, and started mass producing the Aster for a period of a few years. 

To enhance and modernise the Aster CT-80 the company also designed three alternative video display adapters to supplement or replace the TRS-80 compatible video card.
* A very High resolution monochrome video card with [[blitter]] and hardware line drawing capability.
* A colour video card with [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] capability based on the same video chip (the [[Texas Instruments TMS9918|TMS9918]]) as the [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI99/4]] and [[MSX]] computers.
* A color video card that had high resolution capability because it could reprogram the [[character set]] of the 80 x 24 display and could provide a separate programmable character for all of the 1920 (80 x 24) characters on the screen. Because the characters were 8 x 12 pixels this would allow for a resolution of 640 x 288 pixels, which was quite high for the time. This video card also supported 16 foreground and 16 background colors per character (one byte per character position).

A hard disk interface was also in the works.

Finally a replacement for the aging [[Z80]] processor was also being developed in the form of an [[Intel 8086]] board, and 16 bit memory boards.

Such replacements of main system components were possible because the Aster CT-80 was designed to use a backplane that supported 8 and 16 bit processors, and used the modular Eurocard design.

Unfortunately none of these extensions to the system became available because the company folded before they came to fruition.

Perhaps the Aster computer inspired another [[Netherlands|Dutch]] computer firm to name their computer after another typical Dutch flower &amp;mdash; the [[Tulip Computers NV|Tulip]].

An '''animated series''' or '''cartoon series''' is a [[television series]] produced by means of [[animation]]. 

A note on usage: The duration of an individual episode varies from series to series.  While some series may be produced as complete half hour programs, many cartoons are produced as short subjects of 15 minutes or less.  These cartoons are grouped and mixed together according to network programming demands.  Thus a particular animated series may appear in a number of formats, often anonymously, e.g. ''The Cartoon Hour''.

Below is a sample list of animated series (the list omits most animated series from [[Japan]], also known as [[anime]], which number in the thousands[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?list=9]):

The '''Atlanta Braves''' are a [[Major League Baseball]] team based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].  They are in the [[National League East|Eastern Division of the National League]]. They are most recently known for their ongoing record of 11 consecutive division championships from [[1995]] to [[2005]] and 14 out of 15 (except the strike-shortened 1994 season), the most in any professional North American sport. However, they have not been as successful in the World Series, having won only one and losing four during that time.  The Braves have won 16 divisional titles, 17 National League pennants, and 3 World Series championships ([[1914 World Series|1914]], [[1957 World Series|1957]], and [[1995 World Series|1995]]).  

== Franchise history ==
===The Boston years===
The Boston franchise that became known as the Braves took part in some of baseball's most memorable moments, achievements, and pennant races. None were more remarkable than the mid-season last-to-first transformation of the 1914 &quot;Miracle&quot; Braves. After a dismal 4-18 start  to the season, the fanbase was turned off, as it looked like the Braves were headed for another bottom-feeder season. Everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong. After losing both games of a doubleheader to the visiting [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] on July 4, Boston's record stood at 26-40, 15 games behind the league-leading [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]].  The only man left believing was the team's manager, &quot;Miracle Man&quot; [[George Stallings]]. Slowly, the team began to turn itself around. It had solidified around the phenomenal double-play tandem of [[Rabbit Maranville]] and [[Johnny Evers]] (of &quot;Tinker to Evers to Chance&quot; fame), and a strong starting rotation led by [[Lefty Tyler]], [[Dick Rudolph]], and [[Bill James (baseball player)|Bill James]]. When the team rallied to sweep the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in a doubleheader on July 19, Stallings declared that the team was playing ball better than any other in the league, and was ready to catch New York. From there came a romp unmatched in baseball history. When the Giants came to Boston for a three-game series on September 7-8, the Braves had won 41 of 53 games since July 4.  Boston won two of the three contests to take sole possession of first place. From that point, the Braves won 25 of their final 31 games, while the Giants went 16-16. The Braves went 68-19 after July 4; not only did they finish first, but they ended up 10.5 games ahead of the second place Giants.
The team entered the World Series as a heavy underdog to [[Connie Mack (baseball)|Connie Mack]]'s [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia A's]]. Nevertheless, the Braves dominated the series in every phase, and swept away the favored Athletics. They were now World Champions. The turnaround was complete. The team was at the top of the league in both pitching, and hitting, and its leader, Evers, won the Chalmers Award, which is equivalent to today's MVP. A miraculous season of these proportions has never been seen since in professional sports.

In 1948 the team won the pennant, behind the pitching of [[Warren Spahn]] and [[Johnny Sain]] who won 39 games between them. The remainder of the rotation was so thin that in September the Boston Post journalist Gerald Hern characterized them by the poem
:''First we'll use Spahn''
:''then we'll use Sain''
:''Then an off day''
:''followed by rain''
:''Back will come Spahn''
:''followed by Sain''
:''And followed''
:''we hope''
:''by two days of rain.''
The poem received such a wide audience that the sentiment, usually now paraphrased as ''&quot;Spahn and Sain and pray for rain&quot;'', entered the baseball vocabulary. Ironically, in the 1948 season, the Braves actually had a better record in games that Spahn and Sain ''did not'' start than in games they did.

===The Milwaukee years===
Their two pennants notwithstanding, the Braves term in Boston was not a successful time.  Attendances steadily dwindled until, on [[March 13]] [[1953]], then-owner [[Lou Perini]] announced he was moving the team to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], where the Braves had their top farm club, the [[Milwaukee Brewers minor league|Brewers]].  Milwaukee had long been a possible target for relocation - [[Bill Veeck]] had tried to move his [[St. Louis Browns]] there years earlier but was voted down by the other [[American League]] owners.

As the [[1950s]] progressed the reinvigorated Braves became increasingly competitive.  Sluggers [[Eddie Mathews]] and [[Hank Aaron]] drove the offense (they would hit a combined 863 home runs as Braves), whilst Spahn, [[Lew Burdette]] and [[Bob Buhl]] anchored the rotation.  In 1957, the Braves celebrated their first pennant in nine years led by Aaron's [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP season,]] leading the National League in home runs and RBIs.  The postseason culminated in the Braves' first [[World Series]] win in over 40 years, defeating the [[New York Yankees]] of [[Yogi Berra|Berra]], [[Mickey Mantle|Mantle]] and [[Whitey Ford|Ford]] in seven games.  Burdette, the Series MVP, threw three complete game victories, giving up only two earned runs.

In 1958, the Braves again won the National League pennant and jumped out to a three games to one lead in the World Series against New York once more, thanks in part to the strength of Spahn's and Burdette's pitching.  But the Yankees stormed back to take the last three games, in large part to World Series MVP [[Bob Turley|Bob Turley's]] pitching.  The 1959 season saw the Braves finish the season in a tie with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], but Milwaukee fell in a three-game playoff with two straight losses to Los Angeles.  The Dodgers would go on to defeat the [[Chicago White Sox]] in the World Series. Many residents of Chicago and Milwaukee had been hoping for a Sox-Braves Series, as the cities are only about 75 miles apart, but it was not to be.

The next six years were the very definition of up-and-down for the Braves.  The 1960 season featured two no-hitters by Burdette and Spahn, and Milwaukee finished seven games behind the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in second place.  The 1961 season saw a drop in the standings for the Braves (fourth), despite Warren Spahn recording his 300th victory and pitching another no-hitter that year.

Hank Aaron hit 45 home runs in 1962, a Milwaukee career high for him, but that didn't translate in wins for the Braves as they finished fifth.  In 1963, Aaron led the league with 44 home runs and Spahn was once again the ace of the staff, going 23-7.  However, none of the other Braves produced at that level, and the team finished in the lower half of the league, or the &quot;second division&quot;, for the first time in its short history in Milwaukee.

The Milwaukee Braves have the distinction of being the only Major League club to never suffer a losing season.

===The Atlanta years===
By the early [[1960s]], a new group of owners (based out of Chicago) sought relocation to a larger television market.  Keen to attract them, the City of Atlanta constructed a new ballpark, Atlanta Stadium, which was officially opened in 1965.  The Braves announced their intention to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season, but a lawsuit filed in Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year.  In 1966, the Braves completed the move to Atlanta.  A .500 baseball team in the first few years (85-77, 77-85 and 81-81 respectively), they won the 1969 NL West pennant, before being swept by the &quot;Miracle [[New York Mets|Mets]]&quot; in the NLCS. They would not win it again until [[1982]], under [[Joe Torre]].

In the meantime, fans had to be satisfied with the achievements of [[Hank Aaron]].  In the relatively hitter friendly confines of Atlanta Stadium (&quot;The Launching Pad&quot;), he actually increased his offensive production, and by the end of the 1973 season had hit 713 home runs, one short of [[Babe Ruth]]'s record.  Throughout the winter he received racially motivated death threats, but stood up well under the pressure.  The next season, it was only a matter of time before he set a new record.  On [[April 4]] he hit #714 in [[Cincinnati Reds|Cincinnati]], and on [[April 8]], in front of his home fans, he finally beat Ruth's mark.

In 1976 the team was purchased by media magnate [[Ted Turner]], owner of [[superstation]] [[WTBS]]. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was re-named [[Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium]]. Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner. On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself manager, but was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the Braves lost 2-1 to the Pirates to bring their losing streak to 17 games).  This is because MLB has not allowed owners to manage their teams since Connie Mack of the A's died.

After three straight losing seasons, [[Bobby Cox]] was hired for his first stint as manager of the franchise for the 1978 season. Cox promoted a 22-year-old slugger named [[Dale Murphy]] into the starting lineup. Murphy hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons, but struggled on defense, positioned at either catcher or first base while being unable to adeptly play either. However, in 1980, Murphy was moved to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability, while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974. Cox was fired after the 1981 season and replaced with [[Joe Torre]], under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969. Strong performances from [[Bob Horner]], [[Chris Chambliss]], pitcher [[Phil Niekro]], and short relief pitcher [[Gene Garber]] helped the Braves, but no Brave was more acclaimed than Murphy, who won both a [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player]] and a [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]] award. Murphy also won a Most Valuable Player award the following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s. Murphy, excelling in defense, hitting, and running, was consistently recognized as one of the league's best players, but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985-1990.  The 1986 season saw the return of Bobby Cox to the Braves organization as general manager.

Cox was promoted to manager in the middle of the 1990 season, replacing Russ Nixon.  Not only was this season a losing effort, the Braves traded Dale Murphy to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player. However, pitching coach [[Leo Mazzone]] began training young pitchers [[Tom Glavine]], [[Steve Avery]], and [[John Smoltz]]. Perhaps the Braves' most important move, however, was not on the field, but in the front office. Immediately after the season, [[John Schuerholz]] was hired as general manager.

The following season, Glavine, Avery, and Smoltz would be recognized as the best young pitchers in the league, winning 52 games between them. Meanwhile, behind position players [[David Justice|Dave Justice]], [[Ron Gant]] and unexpected league Most Valuable Player and batting-average leader [[Terry Pendleton]], the Braves overcame a slow start to go 47-22 over the last three months of the season and win 8 of their last 9, edging the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] by one game in one of baseball history's more memorable playoff races. They defeated the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in a tightly contested seven-game [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]] only to lose the [[World Series]], also in seven games, to the [[Minnesota Twins]]. Despite the loss, the Braves' success would continue. In the 1992 season, the Braves would reach the NLCS again and defeat, once again, in seven games, the Pirates, only to lose in the World Series to a dominating [[Toronto Blue Jays]] team. In 1993, the Braves signed [[Cy Young Award]] winning pitcher [[Greg Maddux]], leading many baseball insiders to declare the pitching staff the best of all-time. The Braves would win a World Series in 1995, defeating the [[Cleveland Indians]] in six games. With this World Series victory, the Braves became the first team in Major League Baseball to win world championships in three different cities. With their strong pitching being a constant, the Braves would also appear in the 1996 and 1999 World Series, and have an ongoing streak of 14 straight division titles. Pitching is not the only constant in the Braves organization. At present, Cox is still the Braves' manager, and Schuerholz remains the team's GM, though Mazzone moved on to become the pitching coach of the Baltimore Orioles shortly after the 2005 season. Pendleton did not finish his playing career in Atlanta, but has returned to the Braves system as the hitting coach.

During the Braves' rise to prominence in the early [[1990s]], their long-standing ethnic nickname came under much closer scrutiny. The team was especially criticized for selling plastic and foam tomahawks, encouraging the so-called &quot;tomahawk chop&quot; and the accompanying war cry emitted by the fans. Ironically, many of those tomahawks were made by [[Cherokee]] manufacturers in [[North Carolina]]. Their response to the criticism was the pragmatic answer, &quot;As long as they keep buying them, we'll keep making them.&quot;

In 2001, Atlanta won the [[National League]] East division, swept the [[National League Division Series|NLDS]] against the [[Houston Astros]], then lost to the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in the [[NLCS]]. In 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Braves won their division again, but lost in the NLDS in all three years 3 games to 2 to the [[San Francisco Giants]], [[Chicago Cubs]], and [[Houston Astros]], respectively. In 2005, the Braves won their 11th consecutive division title. This pennant marked the first time any MLB team made the postseason with more than 4 rookies who each had more than 100 ABs.  However, they lost the National League Division series to the Astros in 4 games with the final game being the longest game in playoffs history at 18 innings and 5 hours 50 minutes (it ended with a walk-off home run by [[Chris Burke]]).

==Quick facts==
:'''Founded:''' [[1871 in sports|1871]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] as the [[Boston Red Stockings]] of the [[National Association of Professional Baseball Players|National Association]].  The club became a charter member of the [[National League]] in [[1876 in sports|1876]] and has remained in the league without a break since then. The Braves are the oldest continuously operating sports franchise in North American sports. Arguably, they can trace their ancestry to the original [[Cincinnati Reds|Cincinnati Red Stockings]] of 1869-1870, baseball's first openly professional team.  When the N.A. formed, Cincinnati's backers declined to field a team in the new league, and Red Stockings player-manager [[Harry Wright]] along with three of the best players from that team moved collectively to Boston and took the nickname with them.
:'''Formerly known as:''' [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston Braves]] ([[1912 in sports|1912]]-[[1952 in sports|1952]]), and [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee Braves]] ([[1953 in sports|1953]]-[[1965 in sports|1965]]). Prior to 1912, the Boston team had several unofficial nicknames:  &quot;Red Stockings&quot; in the [[1870s]] and [[1880s]]; &quot;Beaneaters&quot; in the [[1890s]] and early [[1900s]]; &quot;Doves&quot; (when the Dovey family owned the franchise, [[1907 in sports|1907]]-[[1910 in sports|1910]]) and &quot;Rustlers&quot; (when [[William Russell (lawyer)|William Russell]] owned the franchise, [[1911 in sports|1911]]).  Following the [[1935 in sports|1935]] season, after enduring bankruptcy and a series of poor seasons, new owner [[Bob Quinn (baseball)|Bob Quinn]] asked a team of sportswriters to choose a new nickname, to change the team's luck.  The sportswriters chose &quot;Bees&quot;, which was adopted in [[1936 in sports|1936]], though it never really caught on, with Quinn even refusing to use it, although their home uniforms in this interval were changed to feature a large block letter B (&quot;bee&quot;).  The team dropped the nickname in [[1941 in sports|1941]], using only the official name &quot;Braves&quot; from 1941 on.

The '''Atari ST''' is a [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]] that was commercially popular from 1985 to the early 1990s. It was released by [[Atari]] in [[1985]]. The &quot;ST&quot; allegedly stood for &quot;Sixteen/Thirty-two&quot;, which referred to the [[Motorola 68000]]'s 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals.
&lt;!-- Commenting out; please see the talk page:Another theory is that ST really stood for &quot;Sam Tramiel&quot;, [[Jack Tramiel]]'s eldest son.--&gt;
&lt;!-- Commenting out; please see talk page:This is a plausible explanation, since the Atari ST also used a [[bumblebee]] as the busy mouse pointer image, which might be a reference to Jack's birth name (although the phrase &quot;busy as a bee&quot; was probably the more likely inspiration).--&gt;

==Overview==

The Atari ST was a notable [[home computer]], based on the [[Motorola 68000]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], with 512&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]] of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] or more, and 3½&quot; [[floppy disk]]s as storage. It was similar to other contemporary machines which used the Motorola 68000, the [[Apple Macintosh]] and the [[Commodore Amiga]]. Although the Macintosh was the first widely available computer with a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), it was however limited to a lower-resolution monochromatic display on a smaller built-in monitor. The Atari ST was the first computer with a fully bit-mapped color GUI. It had an innovative single-chip graphics subsystem (designed by Shiraz Shivji) which shared the full amount of system memory, in alternating clock cycles, with the processor, similar to the earlier [[BBC Micro]] and the Unified Memory systems that have become common today.  It was also the first home computer with integral [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] support.

The ST was primarily a competitor to the [[Commodore Amiga]] systems. This platform rivalry was often reflected by the owners and was most prominent in the [[Demo Scene]]. Where the Amiga had custom hardware which gave it the edge in the [[computer game|games]] and videowork market, the ST was generally cheaper and slightly faster at basic operation. Thanks to its built-in [[MIDI]] ports it enjoyed success as a [[music sequencer]] and [[controller]] of [[musical instrument]]s among amateurs and professionals alike, being used in concert by bands such as [[Tangerine Dream]] and 90's UK dance act [[808 State]]. In some markets, particularly [[Germany]], the machine gained a strong foothold as a [[small business]] machine for [[CAD]] and [[Desktop publishing]] work.

The ST was later superseded by the [[Atari TT]] and [[Atari Falcon|Falcon]] computers, and ST technology was used in the creation of the [[Atari Jaguar]] video game console.

Since Atari pulled out of the computer market there has been a market for powerful [[Atari TOS|TOS]]-based machines (clones). Like most &quot;retro&quot; computers the Atari enjoys support in the [[emulator]] scene.

== Origins ==

Atari had created two released machines in the form of the [[Atari 2600]] console (also known as ''VCS'') and the various [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit]] based home computers. Both of these lines were created around the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] and included a number of additional chips assisting this rather basic, but cost-effective CPU in providing graphics and sound. In fact the 8-bit machines had originally intended to be the replacement for the 2600, but they were later reengineered as home computers.

As Atari grew and the management was shuffled by [[Time Warner|Warner]] (their parent company), the creators of the 2600 and 8-bit machines eventually got fed up and left. A group of them led by [[Jay Miner]] formed a small [[think tank]] called '''Amiga''' in [[1982]] and set about creating the third generation machine, this time based on the much more powerful 68000 CPU.

During this time, the [[home computer]] market started to slow down, and the video game market underwent the great [[video game crash of 1983]]. Warner management decided to &quot;get out&quot; and started looking to sell Atari outright. Meanwhile many of the same effects were in the process of decimating [[Commodore International]]. An argument involving Commodore's chairman and largest shareholder Irving Gould, and [[Jack Tramiel]] ensued over development of a new 68000 system, resulting in Tramiel's immediate departure from Commodore in January of [[1984]].

Tramiel immediately formed a [[holding company]], '''Tramiel Technology''', and brought in a number of ex-Commodore staff to continue his project to develop a new, high-performance home computer. While this team, led by Shiraz Shivji, worked on the design, Tramiel discovered that Warner Communications wanted to sell Atari Corp. Tramiel purchased Atari Corp, mainly for the overseas manufacturing and dealer network. The design team considered &quot;one-upping&quot; the Macintosh by using a full [[32-bit]] chip, namely the [[NS32032]], but in talks, [[National Semiconductor]] couldn't supply the numbers, or price, the project needed. In retrospect this proved to be lucky, as a prototype built on the NS32032 benchmarked slower than the 16-bit 68000.

The basic hardware design quickly &quot;gelled&quot; into a form that was almost identical to the ST that eventually shipped. The design used off-the-shelf parts where possible. Disk drive support was provided by the [[WD1772]], a standard [[Western Digital]] chip, and sound from a [[General Instruments AY-3-8912|Yamaha YM2149]]. Serial, MIDI, and other I/O functions were provided by standard [[Motorola]] chips. The custom chips included a memory controller, the simple &quot;Shifter&quot; graphics chip, a [[Direct memory access|DMA]] controller, and the &quot;GLUE&quot; interrupt handler.

At about the same time, Amiga were desperate for a buyer or investor, and the &quot;Warner owned&quot; Atari had paid Amiga for development work (''see: [http://www.atarimuseum.com/articles/mickey.html &quot;TOP SECRET: Confidential Atari-Amiga Agreement&quot;]''). In return Atari was to get one-year exclusive use of the design. Atari was also working on a &quot;high-end&quot; 68000 based machine at the time, so it is not clear what their intentions for the Amiga design were.

By May Tramiel had secured his funding, bought the remains of Atari from Warner for a very low price, and set about re-creating his empire. One of his first acts was to fire practically all of Atari's highly respected engineering staff, and cancel almost all ongoing development. The Amiga crew was upset, and soon entered discussions with Commodore that led to them purchasing Amiga, and quickly cancelling Atari's license. Tramiel was furious, and the resulting court case lasted for years. Finally, it settled out of court, the details of which remain secret.

Work thus continued with the design started at Tramiel Technology. With the basic design complete, the team started looking at solutions for the [[operating system]]. Soon after the buyout [[Microsoft]] approached Tramiel with the suggestion that they port [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] to the platform, but the delivery date was out about two years, far too long for their needs. Another possibility was [[Digital Research]], who were working on a new GUI-based system then known as Crystal, soon to become [[Graphical Environment Manager|GEM]]. A final possibility was to write a new system in-house, but this was eventually rejected due to risk.

DR seemed generally uninterested in porting the system, so a team from Atari was sent to the DR Monterey headquarters to do it themselves. They were given the latest versions of the [[Intel 8086]] code from their DR counterparts, and would port it to the 68000 as quickly as possible. A version, running on top of [[CP/M|CP/M-68K]], was available just in time for the January 1985 [[CES]], where the ST was introduced.

[[Image:Atari_TOS_1_0.png|right|TOS 1.0 with the GEM user interface]]CP/M-68K was essentially a direct port of CP/M's original, and very old, operating system. By 'modern' standards of 1985, it was rather outdated both in terms of command structure, and that it didn't support hierarchical file systems. DR was also in the process of building a new [[DOS]]-like operating system specifically for GEM, '''GEMDOS''', and there was some discussion of whether or not a port of GEMDOS could be complete in time for product delivery in June. The decision was eventually taken to port it, resulting in a GEM/GEMDOS system Atari referred to as [[Atari TOS|TOS]] (officially '''The Operating System''', unofficially re-extrapolated as '''Tramiel Operating System''' by sceners). This was beneficial to the system, as it allowed the ST to read and write standard [[IBM PC]] disks.
 
The design shipped in June 1985 as the '''520ST'''. The machine had gone from concept to store shelves in a little under a year. Atari had originally intended to release versions with 128&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]] and 256&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM as the '''130ST''' and '''260ST''' respectively, but the rapidly falling prices of RAM at the time led them to cancel these versions and it was released with 512&amp;nbsp;kB only. In [[1986]] the '''1040ST&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;''' (also written '''STF''') shipped with 1&amp;nbsp;[[mebibyte|MiB]] of RAM and featured an integral [[power supply]] and double sided floppy-disk drive. The '''1040ST''' was the first personal computer shipped with a base RAM configuration of 1&amp;nbsp;MiB, and when the list price was reduced to $999 in the U.S. it became the first computer to break the $1000/MiB price barrier. However, the ST remained generally the same internally over the majority of its several-year lifespan. The choice of model numbers was inherited from the model-numbers of the ''XE series'' of the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers.

==Description==

The 520ST was an all-in-one unit, similar to earlier home computers like the [[Commodore 64]]. However, by this time the market demanded a &quot;full sized&quot; keyboard, including cursor keys and a numeric keypad. For this reason the 520ST was fairly &quot;boxy&quot;, generally oversized for a machine that one had to move around to adjust the keyboard position. Adding to this problem was the number of large cables needed to connect to the peripherals. This problem was addressed to some degree in the follow-on models which included a built-in floppy disk, though this addition resulted in a notoriously bad repositioning of the mouse and joystick sockets to a cramped niche ''underneath'' the keyboard (as the mouse shared a socket with the second joystick, any user wanting to both use the GUI and play games against a friend would find themselves regularly going through the frustrating and painful ritual of lifting the entire machine up at 45 degrees, before eking out one plug and struggling the other one in - whilst trying not to break anything).

Following most machines of the era, and thus differing greatly from earlier Atari designs, the ST used a large number of one-off ports mounted on the rear of the machine. In addition to power and monitor connections (plus TV-out where fitted), the ST included an [[RS-232]] serial port, a [[Centronics]] parallel printer connection, two Atari-standard [[joystick]]/mouse ports (relocated on the more integrated machines - see above), an ACSI (not [[SCSI]]) [[hard drive]] connector, the floppy disk connector (retained on later machines to allow a two-disc setup), a rarely-used cartridge port, and two MIDI ports. An interesting feature of the Centronics port as supplied was that it could also be used for joystick input (a distinctly off-spec alteration of the standard), and several games made use of available adaptors that plugged into the printer socket and provided two additional 9-pin joystick ports - notably classics Gauntlet and Gauntlet II, and Dynablaster (UK release name for Bomberman - also allowing one player to enter the fray using keyboard control for a frenetic 5-way battle)... even without an army of friends this was useful on games that supported it, to allow a 2-player match without having to undergo the tiresome mouse/joystick swapping ritual.

The case followed the Tramiel-Atari design of the era, being basically wedge shaped, with a series of grilles cut into the rear for airflow. The original 520ST design used an external floppy drive, the 1040ST-style case featured a built-in floppy drive. The power supply for the early 520ST was a large external brick while the 1040ST's was inside the machine. In addition the majority of the machines had keyboards with a very soft tactile feedback, not as good as those on the IBM PC, with unique and strange rhomboid function keys across the top edge. The design was much improved with the '''Mega ST''' series which included a detached high-quality keyboard and stronger case, but this apparently cost too much to produce and the design was not used widely.

Atari initially used single-sided [[floppy disk|disk drives]] that could store up to 360&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]]. Later drives were double-sided versions that stored 720&amp;nbsp;kB. Due to the early sales of so many of the single-sided drives, almost all software would ship on two single-sided disks instead of a single double-sided one, in fear of cutting off all the other owners. The situation was complicated by the single sided drives somehow having their read/write head mounted on the 'wrong' side of the disc, compared to most other single sided drives, and the 'first' head of double sided drives - ST magazines wishing to cater for the entire audience whilst still supplying a large amount of material on a single cover disc had to adopt innovative custom formats to work around this problem. Another sticking point was that the Atari double-sided drive could read IBM formatted disks, but IBM PCs could not read Atari disks. This was a 'minor' formatting issue that was later resolved by third-party software formatters and TOS upgrades.

Additionally they had originally intended to include GEM's GDOS hardware abstraction layer, which allowed programs to draw (display, print, etc.) graphics to any supported device with no changes. This allowed developers to write a program for display to the screen, and get high quality printing &quot;for free&quot;. However GDOS was not ready at the time the ST started shipping, and while Atari promised to include it as soon as possible, it was not released until much later. This left printing support up to the developers, who had to create their own engines for every possible printer.

Similarly the custom &quot;[[BLiTTER]]&quot; was to be included to speed the performance of graphics operations on the screen, but this was isolated to their higher-end machines (e.g. later 1MiB 1040STFM models with TOS v1.04) and the enhanced '''STE''' models when it was eventually released. As a result, even when the BLiTTER eventually shipped, it was ignored by game developers because it was not present on all machines. However, properly written GEM programs could use the BLiTTER seamlessly since the GEM [[Application programming interface|API]] had always supported it.

On the plus side the ST was less expensive than most machines, including [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh Plus]], and tended to be faster than most (''external link:'' [http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/3015/16bit.html price comparison]). Largely as a result of the price/performance factor, the ST would go on to be a fairly big seller, notably in markets where the foreign exchange rates amplified prices. Indeed, the company's English advertising strapline of the era was 'power without the price'.

For this reason the ST was most popular in Europe, especially in Germany.  Also, the famously very crisp, 640 by 400 pixels picture of its [[monochrome|black &amp; white]] monitor (and unusually steady/easy on the eyes - for the time - 70 Hz refresh rate) made it popular for small-office applications. In fact, an Atari ST and reasonable [[terminal emulation]] software was much cheaper than a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital]] [[VT220]] terminal, which was normally needed by offices with central computers.

== The enhanced STs ==

For about the first four years, nothing much had changed in the capabilities of the ST [[platform (computing)|platform]], except for new machines being released with greater RAM, and quietly introduced upgrades to the built-in TOS ROMs ('quietly', as they resolved various bugs or added 'missing' features that Atari didn't exactly wish to shout about), from the basic but functional v1.00 of 1985 through to the 'final' (for non-STE or Mega models) and much improved v1.04 'Rainbow TOS' of 1989 (named for the VCS-like scrolling colour bars in the Atari logo found in the top corner of the desktop and in the 'About' screen). In late [[1989]], [[Atari]] released the '''ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;''' (also written '''STE''') &amp;mdash; a version of the ST with improvements to the multimedia hardware and operating system. 

The STE featured an increased colour palette of 4096 colours from the ST's 512 (though the maximum displayable palette of these without programming tricks was still limited to 16 in the lowest 320x200 resolution), and a new graphics accelerator hardware [[Blitter]] which could quickly move large blocks of data (most particularly, graphics sprites) around in RAM. It also included a new 2-channel digital sound-chip that, like the Amiga, could play 8-bit stereo samples in hardware at up to 50 kHz (the [[General Instruments AY-3-8912|Yamaha YM2149]] could only be coaxed into playing samples by means of software trickery, and then only low-quality 4-bit mono at low sample rates). Two analogue joystick-ports were added (two normal joysticks could be plugged into each port with an adaptor), with all four connectors now being relocated to more easily accessed locations on the side of the case, and RAM was now much more simply upgradable via [[SIMM]]s (previous upgrades requiring soldering new circuit boards or tricky snap-on &quot;piggyback&quot; chips). Despite all of this, it still ran at 8&amp;nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]], and the enhanced hardware was clearly designed to catch up with, rather than improve upon the standard of the Amiga.

The '''STE''' models initially had serious operating system and hardware addressing conflicts resulting in many [[Application software|application]]s and [[computer game|games]] written for the ST line being unstable or even completely unusable (sometimes, this could be solved by expanding the RAM). To make matters worse, the built in floppy disk drives could not read as many tracks on a floppy disk as the built in floppy disk drives on older models. While this was not a problem for most users, some games used the extra tracks as a crude form of copy protection and as a means of cramming more data on the disk, and formatting as many as 86 tracks on an '80 track' disc was a common space-expanding option in custom formatting utilities. Furthermore, even having a joystick plugged in would sometimes cause strange behaviour with a few applications (such as ''[[First Word Plus]]'').

Very little use was made of the extra features of the STE: STE-enhanced and STE-only software was rare, generally being limited to serious art, CAD or music applications, with few enough even semi-major games taking advantage that they could be counted on your fingers. Quality did, however, seem to substitute for quantity, as the coders who took advantage of the new abilities used them to their fullest (STE-only is as common as STE-enhanced, representing software that would have taken enough of a hit being 'downgraded' to a vanilla machine as to not be worth using). Look in external links for Atari STE fanpage, there you will find what software uses special Atari STE features.

Atari went on to release the [[Atari MEGA STE|Mega STE]], an STE in a grey TT case that ran at a switchable 16&amp;nbsp;MHz, with extended video modes similar to some of those available on the TT or Falcon, high density (1.44 MB) floppy disc drive, and an optional built-in 3.5-inch hard disc. It also shipped with TOS v2.06, that offered some basic cosmetic tweaks to the desktop environment that seemed mainly in order to show off the new capabilities (coloured window elements, program icons as well as drives being placable on the desktop, desktop backgrounds, speed switch), no doubt with a good deal of less obvious tweaking to solve continuing compatibility issues.

At some time during the early '90s, the development of the ST-type computer line forked. On one branch was the high-end workstation-oriented [[Atari TT|TT]] (including the classic 32 MHz, 68030-based TT030 and the newer, less popular 40 MHz TT040), and on the other was the entertainment-oriented [[Atari Falcon|Falcon]] (also 68030-based, operating at only 16 MHz, but with improved video modes and extensive custom chip provision, particularly high quality audio DSPs) &amp;mdash; both of which were supposed to be ST compatible, but not particularly compatible with each other. By then, the Atari ST platform was dying and neither of these two machines took off in anything like the quantities that were hoped. Atari's legendarily bad development and marketing strategies did little to help matters, effectively condemning numerous very technically accomplished but commercially stillborn computers to a premature demise.

Following the implosion of Atari Corp and its dissolution as a going concern in the hardware manufacturing field (the name - along with debts and warehouses of increasingly obsolete stock - being sold on to many holders before ending up in the hands of Mattel), [[Medusa Computer Systems]] manufactured some powerful 3rd-party Atari Falcon/TT-compatible machines that used [[68040]] and [[68060]] processors, based around multimedia (particularly audio but also video), CAD and office uses. Similarly to Amiga, various hardware revivals along similar lines have been mooted, since by other manufacturers, then abandoned.

== Future of the platform ==

Despite the lack of a hardware supplier and commercial software vendors, there is a small active community dedicated to keeping the ST platform alive. There have been advancements in the operating system, software emulators (for Windows, Mac &amp; Linux), and some hardware developments. There are accelerator cards, such as the CT60 &amp; CT63, which is a (much needed) [[68060]] based accelerator card for the Falcon, and there is the [[Atari Coldfire Project]], which aims at developing an Atari-clone based on the [[Coldfire]] processor.

== Software ==

The ST was the first [[home computer]] with built-in MIDI ports, and there was plenty of MIDI-related software for use professionally in music studios, or by amateur enthusiasts. The popular Windows/Macintosh application ''[[Cubase]]'' originated on the Atari ST.

Music [[tracker]] software was popular on the ST, such as the ''[[The Carebears Demo Crew|TCB]] Tracker'', aiding the production of both surprisingly high quality music from the Yamaha synthesizer ('chiptunes') and Amiga-aping (if scratchy-sounding on non-STEs) 'module'-type sample driven pieces.

An innovative music composition program that combined the sample playing abilities of a tracker with conventional music notation (which was usually only found in MIDI software) was called ''Quartet'' (after it's 4-note polyphonic tracker, which displayed one monophonic stave at a time on colour screens).

Also popular on the ST was professional [[Desktop publishing]] software, such as ''Calamus''; office tools such as word processors and spreadsheets; and various CAD and CAM tools from amateur hobbyist to professional grade, all being largely targeted or even limited to high resolution monochrome-monitor owners. Several art programs were available for the system, despite its relatively limited abilities (Neopaint, Degas &amp; Degas Elite, Canvas, Deluxe Paint, Cyberpaint, etc), many featuring surprisingly advanced features such as 3D design, animation, and palette switching tricks for extra on-screen colours (most especially Spectrum512, which boasted an ability to allow every single available colour to be on-screen at once, and up to 46 in each scan line - the STE never had a Spectrum4096, but other more minor applications filled this speciality niche, one even going so far as to trick the shifter into displaying a maximum 19200 colours).

Some arguably over-ambitious (but ultimately functional) arts software was available for the machine, including dedicated 3D modellers, several raytracers (full screen, true colour renders of complex scenes could literally take days to compute for a single frame, and were only viewable with the aforementioned special packages), and even video capture and editing applications using special video capture 'dongles' connected using the cartridge port - low frame rate, mainly silent and monochrome, but progressing to sound and basic colour (in still frames) by the end of the machine's life.

There were many software development tools available for the Atari ST: 68000 assemblers, Pascal and C compilers, and novelty tools such as ''[[Shoot'Em-Up Construction Kit|SEUCK]]''. The ST came bundled with a disk that contained amongst other things ''[[ST BASIC]]'', the first BASIC for the ST. However, due to its poor quality, it was eventually replaced by other BASICs, such as ''[[GFA BASIC]]'', FaST BASIC (notable for being one of the few programs to actually be supplied as a ROM cartridge instead of on disc) and the relatively famous ''[[STOS BASIC programming language|STOS]]'', a cousin of AMOS on the Amiga, and powerful enough that it was used (with a compiler, opposed to its usual runtime interpreter) for the production of at least two commercial titles and an innumerable host of good quality shareware and public domain games.

The ST was one of the leading platforms for computer games from 1986 to 1988, inclusive, and continued as a mainstay of the scene for many years later, until succumbing to the greater success of the Amiga, and the rise of consoles and IBM PCs in the early-mid 90s, with some of the very best games not being released until 1992 or 1993.

Notable individuals who developed games on the ST include [[Peter Molyneux]], [[Doug Bell]], [[Jeff Minter]], [[Jeremy San]], [[James Hutchby]], [[Dimitri Koveos]] and [[David Braben]]. The first real-time 3D role-playing computer game, ''[[Dungeon Master (computer game)|Dungeon Master]]'', was first developed and released on the ST, and was the best-selling software ever produced for the platform. In the early [[1990s]] the software houses gradually stopped producing ST versions of their games as demand dried up, and the games' technical requirements increasingly outpaced what even a master programmer could achieve with the system (it is puzzling as to why so few Sega Genesis games were ported to either the ST or Amiga, as they shared the same CPU and much in the way of graphics and sound capability, even down to the Yamaha synth chip - the gamut of 90s ST games might otherwise have been much larger). The final 'big' game which was reputedly in development but didn't quite make it to publication was a port of 'Monkey Island II - LeChuck's Revenge' from LucasArts. An Amiga version had already made it to market, so an almost straight translation should have been easy from this existing 68000 code - however the small potential market must not have seemed worth the amount of work down-converting a (then-) record-breaking (and expensive to manufacture) seven floppy discs' worth of graphics, animation, sound and custom chip code would have represented. See ''[[List of Atari ST games]]'' and ''[[:Category:Atari ST games]]''.

Utility software was available to drive hardware add-ons such as video digitisers. Office Productivity and graphics software was also bundled with the ST ([[HyperPaint II]] by [[Dimitri Koveos]], [[HyperDraw]] by [[David Farmborough]], [[3D-Calc]] spreadsheet by Frank Schoonjans, and several others commissioned by [[Bob Katz]], later of [[Electronic Arts]]).

There was a thriving output of [[public domain]] and [[shareware]] software which was distributed by, in the days long before public internet access, [[public domain software library|public domain software libraries]] that advertised in magazines and on popular dial-up Bulletin Board Systems.

Remarkably, a modest core fanbase for the system, supporting a dwindling number of good quality print magazines, survived to the mid 90s and the birth of the modern, publicly accessible internet as we know it. Despite the limited graphics, memory, and temporary hard storage capabilities of the system, several email, FTP, telnet, IRC, and even full-blown graphical world wide web browser applications are available and usable on the ST.

== Technical specifications ==

===ST/ST&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;/ST&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;/ST&lt;sup&gt;FM&lt;/sup&gt;===

As originally released in the '''520ST''':

*CPU: [[Motorola 68000]] @ 8&amp;nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]]
*RAM: 512&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]] to a maximum of 4 MiB (depending on system purchased - later 3rd party upgrades extended this to 14 MiB by replacing the original limited capability MMU)
*Display modes: 320×200 (16 colour), 640×200 (4 colour), 640×400 (mono), palette of 512 colours (all resolutions and palettes extendible to some extent with software tricks)
*Sound: [[General Instruments AY-3-8912|Yamaha YM2149]] 3-voice squarewave plus 1-voice white noise mono soundchip (4-bit sample capable with software tricks)
*Drive: Single-sided 3½&quot; [[floppy disk]] drive, 360 kB capacity when formatted to standard 9 sector, 80 track layout.
*Ports: TV out (on ST-M and ST-FM models, NTSC or PAL standard RF modulated), [[MIDI]] in/out (with 'out-thru'), [[RS-232]] serial, [[Centronics]] parallel (printer), monitor ([[RGB]] or Composite Video colour and [[monochrome|mono]], 13-pin DIN), extra disk drive port (15 pin DIN), [[Direct memory access|DMA]] port (ACSI port, Atari Computer System Interface) for [[hard disk]]s and Atari Laser Printer (sharing RAM with computer system), joystick and mouse ports (9-pin MSX standard)
*[[Operating System]]: [[Atari TOS|TOS]] v1.00 ('''''T'''he '''O'''perating '''S'''ystem''/'Tramiel Operating System') with the [[Graphical Environment Manager]] (GEM) WiMP (Windows, Mouse, Pointer) GUI

Very early machines included the OS on a floppy disk (bootstrapped from a very small core boot ROM), but this was quickly replaced with (expanded capacity) [[Read-only memory|ROM]] versions of TOS 1.0 instead (this change also removed any possibility for memory specifications below 512 kB, as GEM loaded it's entire 192 kB code into faster RAM when booting the desktop). Soon after this change, most production models became ST&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;s, with an integrated single (520STF / 512 kB RAM) or double (1040STF / 1024 kB RAM) sided double density drive built-in, but no other changes. The next later models used an upgraded version of TOS - 1.02 (also known as TOS 1.2). Another early addition (after about 6 months) was an [[RF Modulator]] that allowed the machine to be hooked to a colour TV when run in its low or medium resolution (525/625 line 60/50 Hz interlace, even on RGB monitors) modes, greatly enhancing the machine's saleability and perceived value (no need to buy a prohibitively expensive, even if exceptionally crisp and clear, monitor). These models were known as the '''520ST&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;''' (or '''520STM'''). Later '''F''' and '''FM''' models of the 520 had a built in double-sided disk drive instead of a single-sided one. 

===ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;===

As originally released in the '''520ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;''':

*All of the features of the 520STFM
*Drive: Double-sided 3½&quot; [[floppy disk]] drive, 720 kB when formatted to standard 9-sector, 80-track parameters (over 900 kB with certain extended-sector and -track formats)
*Built in RF Modulator
*Extended palette of 4,096 available colours to choose from
*[[BLiTTER]] chip for fast movement of large data blocks around memory
*Hardware-support for horizontal and vertical fine scrolling (using BLiTTER)
*Sound: Additional [[National LMC 1992]] [[sound chip]] with 2-channel stereo 8-bit [[PCM]] sound at up to 50 kHz, with adjustable Bass and Treble EQ (output only).
*Memory: 30-pin SIMM memory slots allowing upgrades up to 4&amp;nbsp;[[mebibyte|MiB]] (allowable: 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and 4.0 MiB due to configuration restraints - later 3rd party upgrade kits allowing a maximum of 14mb, bypassing stock MMU)
*Ability to synchronise the video-timings with an external device so that a video [[Genlock]] device can be used without having to make any modifications to computer's hardware
*Additional ports: Stereo RCA jacks and two analogue joystick ports (with support for analogue devices such as paddles and light pens - no record of these ever being used! Two normal digital joysticks could be plugged into each analogue port with an adaptor). Standard mouse and joystick ports also moved to more accessible positions.
* [[Atari TOS|TOS]] 1.06 (also known as TOS 1.6) on ROM.

Later ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt; models had TOS 1.62 that fixed some major backwards-compatibility bugs in TOS 1.6.

== Models ==

A number of machines were released in the ST family. 
Here they are, in rough chronological order after the original 520ST:

* 520ST+ - Name for early 520STs with 1&amp;nbsp;MiB of RAM, but without floppy disk
* 260ST - European name for the 520ST with 512&amp;nbsp;kB. Used after the release of the 520ST+ to differentiate the cheaper 512&amp;nbsp;kB models from the 1&amp;nbsp;MiB models
* 520ST&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt; - a 520ST with a built-in modulator for TV output
* 520ST&lt;sup&gt;FM&lt;/sup&gt; - a 520STM with a newly redesigned motherboard in a larger case with a built-in floppy disk drive
* 1040ST&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt; - a 520STFM with 1&amp;nbsp;MiB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk, but without modulator
* 1040ST&lt;sup&gt;FM&lt;/sup&gt; - a 520STFM with 1&amp;nbsp;MiB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk
* Mega ST (MEGA2, MEGA4) - 1040 with 2 or 4&amp;nbsp;MiB of RAM, respectively, in a much improved &quot;[[pizza box]]&quot; case with a detached keyboard. These models included the BLiTTER chip, but the OS ROM was not upgraded and the extra GEM functionality needed to be booted from disk.
* 520ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt; and 1040ST&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt; - a 520STFM/1040STFM with enhanced sound, the BLiTTER chip, and a 4096-color palette, in the older 1040 style all-in-one case
* [[Atari MEGA STE|Mega STE]] - same hardware as 1040STE except for a faster 16-MHz processor, in the TT case
* STacy - A [[portable computer|portable]] (but definitely not [[laptop]]) version of the ST. Originally designed to operate on 12 standard [[C cell]] flashlight batteries for portability, when Atari finally realized how quickly the machine would use up a set of batteries (especially when rechargeable batteries of the time supplied insufficient power compared to the intended alkalines), they simply glued the lid of the battery compartment shut, and soon discontinued the machine.
* ST Book (later version portable ST), vastly more portable than the STacy, but sacrificing several features in order to achieve this - notably the backlight, and internal floppy disc drive. Files were meant to be stored on a small amount (1 MiB - though you could fit a lot into 1 and a half floppies back then) of internal flash memory 'on the road' and transferred using serial or parallel links, memory flashcards or external (and externally powered) floppy disc to a 'real' desktop ST once back indoors. The screen is highly reflective for the time, but still hard to use indoors or in low light (the idea of a switchable green LED backlight seeming not to have inspired the Atari technical department as it did many wristwatch manufacturers), it is fixed to the 640x400 1-bit mono mode (not even greyscale emulation of colour in low res is offered), and no external video port was provided. For its limitations, it gained some popularity as being the most utterly portable 'real' computer of the day (slim, light, quiet, reliable, and with a long battery life, even by today's standards for all 5), particularly amongst musicians already used to using the original computer and perhaps having lugged a STacy or even a full ST + Monitor + accessories rig on tour.

== Other models ==

* [[Atari TT|Atari TT030]] &amp;mdash; new machine based on the [[Motorola 68030]] processor running at 32 MHz, in yet another new case design with a detached keyboard. Capable of high screen resolutions with better colour palletes and addressing more memory, with optional onboard hard drive (slotting onto the base as a second, smaller box). Popular with CAD and DTP communities of the time for its sheer graphical capability (it's high resolution only recently having become a common size on modern PCs) and processing speed.
* [[Atari Falcon|Atari Falcon 030]] &amp;mdash; another 68030 based (albeit only 16 MHz) machine like the TT, but in the 1040-style case (yet again) with further upgrades to the graphics and sound, a [[Motorola 56000]] [[digital signal processor|DSP]] for CD-quality sound recording and processing, multitasking OS (on disk) and a [[LocalTalk]] port for networking.
* Medusa 040, Medusa 060, Hades 040, Hades 060 &amp;mdash; 3rd-party Falcon/TT compatible machines manufactured by [[Medusa Computer Systems]].
* Atari ABAQ, or [[Atari Transputer Workstation]] &amp;mdash; A standalone machine containing modified ST hardware and up to 17 transputers capable of massively parallel operations for tasks such as ray tracing.
* Atari Portfolio, a pocket-calculator sized PC XT (as seen being used by John Connor in the film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''), and forerunner to modern PDAs. Designed to easily link up and transfer data with STs using a parallel cable and simple software.
(Also: several Atari PCs - though there was talk of it, none were released with dual PC and ST operating capability onboard, possibly because the ST would have embarrassed the outdated hardware Atari chose to put in their budget IBM clones)

There were also some unreleased prototypes: [http://www.atari-explorer.com/protos-falcon040.html Falcon 040] (''external link'') (based on a [[Motorola 68040]], new case and slots), ST Pad (A4 (Letter paper) sized pen-operated portable ST computer, handheld and with an unlit monochrome LCD screen derived from the ST Book, forerunner of modern tablet PCs), and the STylus (Apple Newton-style palmtop).

== Trivia ==

The standard 8x8 pixel graphical character set for the ST (the main in-ROM &quot;font&quot; for GEM, and text-mode TOS operations) contains, following all the standard numbers, letters, symbols and accented characters, four unusual characters. These can be placed together in a square, forming a basic but recognisable facsimile of the face of [[J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs]], the supposed founder of the [[Church of the Subgenius]].

Jack Tramiel chose to include the [[Hebrew alphabet]] with ST's ROM character set because of his Jewish heritage.

[[Image:Aaliyah-one-in-a-million.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Aaliyah on the cover of her most successful album, ''[[One in a Million (album)|One in a Million]]''.]]
'''Aaliyah Dana Haughton''' ([[January 16]], [[1979]] &amp;ndash; [[August 25]], [[2001]]), better known simply as her [[stage name]] '''Aaliyah''', was an [[United States|American]] [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] [[singer]], [[dancer]], [[Model (person)|fashion model]] and [[Actor|actress]]. Introduced to audiences by R&amp;B singer [[R. Kelly]], Aaliyah became famous in her own right during the mid-1990s with several hit records from the songwriting/production team of [[Missy Elliott|Missy &quot;Misdemeanor&quot; Elliott]] and [[Timbaland]], and their associate [[Steve &quot;Static&quot; Garrett]]. 

Notable for recording several hit records, including five number one [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] hits, one number one pop hit, and seven top 10 singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], Aaliyah sold over 24 million records worldwide during her career. The singer also modeled for [[Tommy Hilfiger]] and starred in two [[Film|motion pictures]] before her death in a [[Accidents and incidents in aviation|plane crash]] in 2001 at the age of 22.

==Life and career==
[[Image:Aaliyah-age-aint-94.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Aaliyah and [[R. Kelly]] on the cover of the 1994 album ''[[Age Ain't Nothing but a Number]]''.]]

===Childhood and early career===
Aaliyah (Ah-Lee-Yah) was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] to Michael and Diane Haughton. Her name is Arabic for the highest, most exalted one, the best. She grew up in [[Detroit, Michigan]] where she attended various schools including the Detroit High School for Fine and Performing Arts. Aaliyah signed with her uncle [[Barry Hankerson]]'s [[Blackground]] label in 1993 and released her debut album, titled ''[[Age Ain't Nothing but a Number]],'' in 1994. The album reached [[Platinum record|platinum status]] within months, and featured the gold-selling singles &quot;Back and Forth&quot; (number one U.S. R&amp;B, 3 weeks), and &quot;At Your Best (You Are Love)&quot; (number two U.S. R&amp;B), a cover of the 1976 [[Isley Brothers]] single. The album went on to reach double platinum status with sales of over two million copies in the U.S. and five million worldwide.

It was revealed that in 1994, when she was 15, she was married to [[R&amp;B]] singer/songwriter R. Kelly, the producer of ''Age Ain't Nothing but a Number''. [[Vibe magazine|''VIBE'' magazine]] in 1995 published a copy of their marriage certificate and claimed Aaliyah had falsified her age as 18 so she and Kelly could be married. Neither agreed or denied the accusations.  Both parties had the marriage quickly annulled when the press found out about the union. R. Kelly did not work on any of Aaliyah's future recordings.

===''One in a Million'' (1996)===
''[[One in a Million (album)|One in a Million]]'', Aaliyah's sophomore album, was chiefly written and produced by then unknowns [[Missy Elliott]] and Tim &quot;Timbaland&quot; Mosley and released on [[August 27]] 1996. The album was a landmark in Aaliyah's career, garnering her mass critical acclaim and introducing Aaliyah's more mature side. It embarked the newfound chemistry of Aaliyah and Timbaland. The album was certified double-platinum within a year, making Aaliyah a major R&amp;B star and igniting the successful careers of Missy Elliott and Timbaland. ''One in a Million'' featured the international smash hit &quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot; (number one U.S. R&amp;B, 2 weeks), &quot;One in a Million,&quot; (number one U.S. R&amp;B airplay, six weeks) and the top 10 U.S. R&amp;B single &quot;The One I Gave My Heart To,&quot; a ballad written by [[Diane Warren]]. The album also included &quot;4 Page Letter&quot; which also received significant airplay on U.S. pop and R&amp;B radio.

Tommy Hilfiger took notice of Aaliyah's &quot;street but sweet&quot; image and gave Aaliyah her first endorsement deal. He immediately signed Aaliyah onto print campaigns, runway shows, and a commercial.  During this period, Aaliyah would also make guest appearances on albums by artists such as Missy Elliott, [[Timbaland &amp; Magoo]], [[Ginuwine]] and [[Playa (band)|Playa]]. Timbaland and Playa's frontman [[Steve &quot;Static&quot; Garrett]] would remain Aaliyah's principal collaborators for the duration of her career. To date, ''One in a Million'' has sold over 3 million copies in the U.S. and eight million worldwide.

[[Image:romeo_must_die_dvd.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Romeo Must Die]]'' DVD cover]]

===Movie roles and soundtracks===
In 1997, Aaliyah appeared on the soundtrack album for the [[Fox Animation Studios]] animated feature ''[[Anastasia (1997 movie)|Anastasia]]'', singing the pop version of &quot;Journey to the Past&quot;. The song was nominated for an [[Academy Award]], and Aaliyah performed the song at the 1997 Academy Awards ceremony, making history. Aaliyah became the youngest female recording artist to perform at the ceremony.

Aaliyah had a huge hit in 1998 with &quot;Are You that Somebody&quot; (number one U.S. R&amp;B airplay, eight weeks), the main single from the ''[[Doctor Dolittle (movie)|Doctor Doolittle]]'' soundtrack. Its video was the third most-played on [[MTV]] that year, and the song's success helped make Aaliyah a household name. The single was a Top 10 hit on the Billboard [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart.

In 2000, she co-starred with [[Jet Li]] in the [[martial-arts]] film ''[[Romeo Must Die]]'', which debuted at number two at the box office.  Aaliyah and Timbaland executive produced the film's soundtrack album and Aaliyah contributed four songs: &quot;Are you Feelin' Me?,&quot; &quot;I Don't Wanna,&quot; &quot;Back in One Piece,&quot; a duet with [[DMX_(rapper)|DMX]], and the international number one hit &quot;Try Again.&quot;  Aaliyah made history once again with her hit single &quot;Try Again.&quot; It became the first song in history to ever reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 based solely on the strength of its radio airplay, without any single sales factored.  After the huge success of &quot;[[Try Again]]&quot; at radio, a [[12 inch single|12&quot; maxi single]] was released for consumer purchase. The radio-only single, &quot;I Don't Wanna&quot;,  peaked at  number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number five on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart. 

In 2001, Aaliyah went to [[Australia]] to co-star with [[Stuart Townsend]] in the film ''[[Queen of the Damned]]'', an adaptation of the [[Anne Rice]] novel of the same name.  While filming ''Queen of the Damned'', Aaliyah also recorded most of her third studio album, ''[[Aaliyah (album)|Aaliyah]]''.

===''Aaliyah'' (2001)===
[[Image:Aaliyah001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Aaliyah in the video for the 2001 single &quot;We Need a Resolution&quot;]]
&quot;We Need a Resolution,&quot; the first single from Aaliyah's highly-anticipated third studio album, was released in April of 2001. The self-titled ''Aaliyah'' was released four months later on [[July 17]], 2001. The album was a critical success, introducing a darker and edgier side to Aaliyah's music, and was noted as having showcased her growth as an artist. The album debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200]] chart, selling over 187,000 copies in its first week, and was certified gold (500,000 copies sold) within four weeks, before her death.

In the summer of 2001, Aaliyah filmed the video for ''Aaliyah's'' intended second single, &quot;More than a Woman&quot;.  After the video was completed, however, it was decided &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; should be the second single instead, and the &quot;More than a Woman&quot; video was temporarily shelved.

===Death===
Aaliyah traveled to the [[Bahamas]] in August 2001 to film the &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; video with director [[Hype Williams]]. On [[August 25]], [[2001]], at 6:45 pm, just after filming was completed, Aaliyah and 7 friends boarded a [[Cessna 402]] small aircraft en route to [[Miami, Florida]]. The journey would have taken approximately 1 hour travel time. Instead, as the plane was lifting off the runway nosedived and impacted in a marsh on the south side of the departure end runway 27. All nine people aboard, including Aaliyah, the pilot and the other seven passengers, were killed. 

Investigators determined the plane was over its total gross weight by several hundred pounds. Although those responsible claimed that the passengers had been asked to leave some luggage behind and had refused, it was later discovered that the passengers, including Aaliyah, had not been informed of the excess weight. Furthermore, an [[autopsy]] of the pilot revealed [[cocaine]] and [[alcoholic_beverage| alcohol]] in his blood. Reports have also suggested the pilot of the plane falsely obtained his licence from Black Hawk Airways by showing hundreds of hours never flown, suggesting he was not qualified to pilot the plane to begin with.

As a result of the accident, Barry &amp; Sons, Inc., a [[corporation]] formed in 1992 to develop, promote and capitalize on the musical talents of Aaliyah, and to oversee the production and distribution of her records, tapes and music videos, brought an unsuccessful lawsuit against Instinct Productions LLC, (a company hired by Barry &amp; Sons, Inc. in August, 2001 to produce a music video entitled &quot;Rock the Boat&quot;) in [[New York Supreme Court|the Supreme Court of the State of New York]].  The case was dismissed since New York State's [[wrongful death]] statute only permits certain people to recover damages for wrongful death.

==Legacy==
&quot;Rock the Boat&quot; went on to become a posthumous hit on radio (reaching number two on Billboard's Hot R&amp;B Singles charts and number 14 on the Hot 100) and video channels, and the news of Aaliyah's death gave her album a notable sales boost, pushing it to number one on the Billboard 200.  The album's two subsequent singles, &quot;More than A Woman&quot; reached number seven on Billboard's Hot R&amp;B singles chart and  number 25 on Hot 100.  &quot;I Care 4 U&quot; reached number three on Billboard's Hot R&amp;B singles chart and number 13 on the Hot 100, the latter attaining success even without the promotional push of a [[music video]]. the ''Aaliyah'' album went on to reach 3X platinum status, with sales of 3.0 million in the U.S. and six million worldwide.

''Queen of the Damned'' was released in early 2002. Before its release, Aaliyah's brother Rashad was called upon to re-dub several of his sister's lines during the post-production [[dubbing|ADR]] process.  Upon its release, the film debuted at number one.

In 2002, a posthumous greatest hits collection, ''[[I Care 4 You]]'', was released in Aaliyah's name.  In addition to well-known hits, it also included six previously unreleased songs from the [[Blackground]] vaults Aaliyah had recorded over the course of her career, including &quot;Miss You,&quot; which became the album's lead single. Its video features Missy Elliott, [[Lil Kim]], [[Toni Braxton]], AJ, Free, Tweet, U-God (of the ''[[Wu-Tang Clan]]'') and DMX, among others, paying tribute to Aaliyah.

Aaliyah was to have had a supporting role as the wife of [[Harold Perrineau Jr.]]'s character, Link, in the two sequels to ''[[The Matrix]]''; her role was ultimately filled by [[Nona Gaye]].  Other films in which Aaliyah was signed to star in were ''[[Honey (movie)|Honey]]'' (which instead was filmed with [[Jessica Alba]] as the star), and a [[Whitney Houston]]-produced remake of the 1976 film ''[[Sparkle (1976 film)|Sparkle]]''. In addition, Aaliyah and one of her agents had pitched and inked a deal with [[Fox Searchlight]] Pictures for her to star in a film based upon a true story about interracial love.

Aaliyah is interred in the [[Ferncliff Cemetery|Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum]] in [[Hartsdale, New York]].

==Trivia==
*Aaliyah and former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]] made UK Chart History in January 2002 when they scored the first, and to this date only, back-to-back posthumous number one hits.

*Aaliyah's maternal grandmother, Mintis L. Hicks Hankerson, was a [[Native American]]
*Aaliyah was considered for the role of Alex in the 2000 film ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]'', but was too young at the time.
*On February 1, 2006, [[Mary J. Blige]] insinuated on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' that although her and Aaliyah were not close friends, She had claimed that Aaliyah had been involved in the same cycle of drug and alcohol abuse that lead to her demise and made Blige relate to the events in her life to break free of her depression.
&lt;!---commented out b/c Kelly and Aaliyah were indeed married. In February 2006, a DVD surfaced in which [[R. Kelly]]'s brother Carey Kelly claims that Aaliyah did in fact have a sexual relationship with R. Kelly.--&gt;
* The song [[Take Away]] is dedicated to her.

'''Albigensians''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Albigeois'') literally means the inhabitants of [[Albi]], a city in southern [[France]].  However, the term was used to refer to the later followers of [[Cathar]]ism, a [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]]-like religious movement of southern France in the [[12th century|12th]] and [[13th century]].  The name originates from the end of the [[12th century]], and was used in [[1181]] by the chronicler [[Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois]]. The name is somewhat misleading as the center of the religious movement was really [[Toulouse]]. 

Early Catharism was much more associated with Gnostic theologies that it inherited from its association with the Paulicianism and Bogomils. However, as one historian phrased it, as time proceeded they became more and more like orthodox Christians. When the term &quot;Albigensians&quot; or &quot;Albigensian Crusades&quot; are used they are usually referring to these later Cathars which were a branch of the earlier sect.

They believed that the principles of good and evil continually oppose each other in the world. The Albigenses opposed marriage, bearing children (because they thought bringing life into the world to be a sin), and eating meat. Their enemies claimed they  advocated suicide,when in reality they only advocated the voluntary cessation of food by those already close to death  (so that when they died, they would have little taint on them and free of Earthly desires). 

In the [[14th century]] the church declared them [[heretics]]. In the years that followed the [[Crusades]] and [[Inquisitions]] against them, they slowly dissolved, and by the 15th century they had completely disappeared as a sect. By the time [[Pope Innocent III]] came to power in 1198, he had resolved to suppress the Cathari. There followed over forty years of war against the indigenous population. During this period some 500,000 Languedoc men women and children were massacred. [http://www.languedoc-france.info/12_cathars.htm] However many of the Albigensians, who as previously stated came closer and closer to identifying with orthodox Christianity, merged with the Waldensians prior to their sect being wiped out in the inquisitions. The Albigensians left their mark on the Waldensian movement which is evident in the Waldensian theology and customs. The Waldensian movement was opposed to the early Cathar movement but was known to work side by side with the Albigensians.

There exists today a modern sect that claims to be Cathars which received its consolamentum from survivers of the original sect. This however is difficult if not impossible to prove.

[[Image:Greek Hoplite.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[hoplite]] wearing (only) a [[helmet]], [[breastplate]] [[greave]]s and a [[shield]].]]

'''Armour''' ([[Commonwealth English]]) or '''armor''' ([[American English]]), is protective clothing intended to defend its wearer from intentional harm in [[combat]] and [[military]] engagements, typically associated with soldiers.  Armour has been used throughout [[recorded history]], beginning with [[hide]]s, [[leather]], and [[bone]], before progressing to [[bronze]], then [[steel]] during the [[middle ages]], to modern fabrics such as [[kevlar]], [[Dyneema]] and [[ceramic]]s. 

Armour was also commonly used to protect [[war animal]]s, such as [[war horse]]s and [[war elephant |elephants]]. Armour for war horses was called &quot;barding&quot;. Armour has also been produced for [[hunting dog]]s that hunt dangerous game, such as [[boar]]s. Since [[World War I]], [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s are protected by [[vehicle armour]].

'''Armour''', or ''[[the armoured]]'' is also a heavily armoured military force or organization, such as heavy [[infantry]] or heavy [[cavalry]] (as opposed to [[light infantry]] or cavalry).  In modern [[armoured warfare]], '''armoured units''' equipped with [[tank]]s serve the historic role of heavy cavalry, and belong to the '''armoured branch''' in a national [[army]]'s organization (sometimes, the ''armoured corps'').  Heavy infantry have been replaced by [[mechanized infantry]].

==History==
[[Image:SamuraiArmor.jpg|thumb|200px|Japanese [[Samurai]] [[Odoshi]] Armor.]] 

Throughout human history, the development of armor has always run parallel to the development of increasingly more efficient weaponry on the battlefield, creating an [[arms race]] of sorts across multiple [[civilization]]s to create better protection without sacrificing mobility.

In [[European history]], well-known armor types include the [[lorica segmentata]] of the [[Roman legions]], the [[chainmail]] [[hauberk]] of the early medieval age, and the full steel [[plate armor]] worn by later medieval [[knight]]s, and a few key parts, ( breast and back plates) by heavy cavalry in several European countries right up to the first year of World War 1. (1914-15).
In East Asian history, [[lamellar armour]] and [[brigandine]] was popular. In pre-Qin dynasty times, leather armor was made out of exotic animals such as rhinoceros. Chinese influence in Japan would result in the Japanese adopting Chinese styles, their famous 'samurai armor' being a result of this influence.

=== European Medieval Armour: Steel cap, or helmet with linked chain mail 950 A.D. to 1300 ===
The early middle ages saw the gradual adoption of coats of chain mail, that offered protection from arrows and edged  weapons. The mail was made of individually forged steel links, which formed a flexible protective coat for the warrior.
A steel helmet fit over the head, usually conforming to the shape of the upper head in a  rounded fashion. A nose guard was
frequently fitted to the helmet, It could best be described as a steel skull cap. Otherwise, the mail, which usually conformed to cover the neck, legs, arms and hands, offering overall  body protection. A medium sized shield was usually carried in the non-weapon bearing hand. This simple combination carried the European combatant through the 3 centuries that included, the [[Norman Conquest]] of England, and the several [[Crusades]] to the &quot;Holy Land&quot;.

=== Transitional period, the 1300s ===
Little by little, small additional plates or disks of steel were added to the mail to protect vulnerable areas. The knees
were capped with steel, and two circular disks were fitted to protect the underarms, by the late 1200s. The small skull 
cap evolved into a bigger true helmet, as it was lengthened downward to protect the back of the neck and the sides of the head. This evolutionary process proceeded to add steel plate elements to protect the shins, feet, throat and upper chest.
and soon (mid to late 1300s) most of the mail was covered by these protective plates. The next phase saw the plate cover
almost all parts of the mail, and several forms of closed-helmets were introduced in the late 1300s.

=== Plate armour, 1400 and later ===
{{main |plate armour}}
[[image:Joan d'Arc.jpg|thumb|200px|St.Joan mounted in armour {{3d_glasses}}]] 

Probably the most recognised style of armour in the world, associated with the [[knight]]s of  Late Medieval Europe,  but continuing later through the 1500 &amp; 1600s in all European countries. Heavy cavalry continued to use breast &amp; back plates into the early 20th century in elite cuirassier units.

=== Musket ball stopping armour ===
[[Image:Zbroja Batorego.jpg|200px|thumb|Armour of King [[Stefan Batory]] of [[Poland]], painted by [[Jan Matejko]].]]

Conventional wisdom says that plate armour faded away on the battlefild soon after firearms were introduced. This is very much not the case. Crude cannon were being used before plate armour became the norm. Soon, in the 1400s a small, mobile &quot;[[gonne|hand cannon]]&quot; was being used by horsemen. Improved cross bows, and the first pistols and pre-musket long arms, began to take a heavy toll on the mail clad, and partially plated knights and foot soldiers. Rather than dooming the use of body armour, the threat of small firearms intensified the use and further refinement of plate armour. There was a 150 year period, that more and better metallurgically advanced steel armour was being used, precisely because of the danger posed by the gun. 
In the early years of pistol and muskets, fire arms were relatively low velocity,the full suits of armor, or breast plates actually stopped bullets fired from a modest distance. The front breast plates were, in fact, commonly shot as a test. The impact point would be encircled with ingraving to point it out. This was called the &quot;proof&quot; . It was not uncommon for a man in armour, mounted on a horse, to ride up closer to the enemy, in a tactical maneuver called &quot;The wheel&quot;, and discharge his hand-cannon or later, pistols, right into the faces of the adversary at close range. Cross-bow arrows, if still used, would seldom penetrate good plate, nor would any bullet but one fired from close range. In effect, (and this has long been misunderstood), plate armour actually came to replace chain mail because it was relatively, &quot;musket ball proof&quot;. Plate would stop all of these at a distance. Hence, guns and cavalry in plate armour were &quot;threat and remedy&quot; together on the battlefield for almost 400 years. For most of that period, it allowed horsemen to fight while being the targets of defending musketeers without being easily killed. Full suits of armour were actually worn by generals and princely commanders right up to the second decade of the 1700s. It was the only  way they could be mounted &amp; survey the overall battlefield with safety from distant musket fire.
The armour shown here of the Polish King, Stefan Batory, is an early example of the &quot;field-marshall style&quot; battle armour.

=== Plate Armour &quot;Barding&quot; for Horses ===
It should be noted that the horse was afforded protection from gunfire, and lances by steel plate &quot;barding&quot;. This gave the horse  protection and added a certain &quot;heroic quality&quot; to the appearance. Fanciful &quot;unicorn spike horns&quot; were frequently added to the protective steel mask. Body areas were protected as well.

=== Characteristics of armour ===
Going back to the heyday of armour in the 1400s,most parts of the [[human body]] have been fitted with specialised steel pieces, typically worn over linen or woollen underclothes and attached to the body via leather straps and buckles, with mail (maille) protecting those areas that could not be fitted with plate (the backs of the knee for instance). Well-known constituent parts of plate-armour include the [[helmet|helm]], [[Gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]]s, [[gorget]] or 'neckguard', [[breastplate]], and [[greaves]] worn on the lower legs.

Typically, full-body plate armour was custom-made for the individual. This was understandably a very time-consuming and expensive undertaking, costing as much as a family house or high-powered car in today's money. As such, it was almost exclusively the luxury of the noble and landed classes, with soldiers of lower standing generally wearing cheaper armour (if at all) typically limited to a helm and a breastplate. Armour often bore an insignia in the interior, that was only visible to the wearer upon removal. Full plate armour made the wearer virtually impervious to sword blows as well as providing some protection against arrows, bludgeons and even early musket shot. Although sword edges could not penetrate the relatively thin (as little as 2 mm) plate, they ''could'' cause serious concussive damage via the impact. Also, although arrows shot from bows could often pierce early plate at close range, later improvements in the steel forging techniques and armour design made even this line of attack increasingly difficult. By its apex, toughened steel plate was almost impregnable on the battlefield.  Knights were instead increasingly felled by ''blunt'' weapons like [[mace]]s or [[warhammer]]s that could send concussive force ''through'' the plate armour resulting in injuries such as broken bones, organ [[haemorrhage]] and/or head trauma. Another tactic was to attempt to strike though the gaps between the armour pieces, using daggers to attack the Knight's eyes or joints.

[[image:etched armour.jpg|thumb|200px|etched plate armour 1560 {{3d_glasses}}]]

Contrary to common misconceptions, a well-made suit of medieval 'battle' armour (as opposed to the primarily ceremonial 'parade' and 'tournament' armours popular with kings and nobility of later years) hindered its wearer no more than the equipment carried by soldiers today. An armoured Knight (trained since his teens in its wearing) could comfortably run, crawl, climb ladders, as well as mount and dismount his horse without recourse to a crane (a myth originating from [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]''). A full suit of medieval plate is thought to have weighed little more than 60 lb (27 kg) on average, considerably ''lighter'' than the equipment often carried by the elite of today&amp;#8217;s armies (e.g., SAS patrols have been known to carry equipment weighing well over 200 lb (91 kg) for many miles).

===Plate Armour slowly discarded===
Gradually starting in the mid 1500s, one plate element after another was discarded to save weight for foot soldiers, but breast and back plates continued to be used though the entire period of the 1700s through Napoleonic times in many (heavy) european cavalry units, all the way to the early 20th Century. Rifled muskets from about 1750 and later, could pierce plate, so cavalry had to be far more mindful of the fire. At the start of World War 1 the French Cuirassiers, in the thousands, rode out to engage the German Cavalry who likewise used helmets and armour. By that period, the shiny armour plate was covered in dark paint and a canvas wrap covered their elaborate Napoleonic style helmets. Their armour was meant to protect only against sabres and light lances. The cavalry had to beware of high velocity rifles and machine guns like the foot soldiers, who at least had a trench to protect them. Machine gunners in that war also occasionally wore a crude type of heavy armour.

===Modern personal armour===
[[Image:Bodyarmor.jpg|thumb|200px|A modern ballistic vest.]]

Today, [[bullet proof vest]]s made of ballistic cloth (e.g [[Kevlar]] or [[Dyneema]]) and ceramic or metal plates are common among [[police force]]s, [[security guard|security staff]] and in some branches of the military. For [[infantry]] applications, lighter protection (historically known as a [[flak jacket]]) is often used to protect [[soldier]]s from [[grenade]] fragments and indirect effects of [[bombardment]], but usually not [[small arms]] fire. This is because [[assault rifle]]s usually fire harder, higher-energy [[armor piercing bullet|bullets]] than [[pistol]]s, and the increased protection needed to stop these would be too cumbersome and heavy to use in [[combat]].

The US Army has adopted Interceptor Ballistic Armor, however, which uses ceramic plates in the chest and back of the armor.  Each plate is rated to stop 3 hits from a 7.62 round at a range of 10m, though accounts in Iraq and Afghanistan tell of soldiers shot as much as seven times in the chest without penetration.

However, as the name implies, modern ballistic armor is much less impervious to close combat weapons such as knives, due to the fact that they were not made to withstand such weapons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''armoured fighting vehicle''' (AFV) is a military [[vehicle]], equipped with protection against hostile attacks and often mounted [[weapon]]s. Most AFVs are equipped for driving in rugged [[terrain]].

Armoured fighting vehicles are classified according to their intended role on the battlefield and characteristics. This classification is not absolute; at different times different countries will classify the same vehicle in different roles. For example, ''[[armoured personnel carrier]]s'' were generally replaced by ''[[infantry fighting vehicle]]s'' in a very similar role, but the latter has some capabilities lacking in the former.

Successful general-purpose armoured fighting vehicles often also serve as the base of a whole family of specialised vehicles, for example, the [[M113]] and [[MT-LB]] tracked carriers, and the [[Mowag Piranha]] wheeled AFV.

== Types of AFVs ==
* [[Tank]] (main battle tank, MBT)
* [[Armoured personnel carrier]] (APC) 
* [[Infantry fighting vehicle]] (IFV) 
* [[Self-propelled gun]]s:
** [[Self-propelled artillery]]
** [[Assault gun]]
** [[Tank Destroyer]]
* [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft]]
* [[Armoured car]]
* [[Tankette]]
* [[Armoured train]]
* [[Aerosan]]

Not AFVs, but often considered together with them:
* Support vehicles (not strictly ''fighting'' vehicles):
** [[Combat engineering vehicle]] (CEV) 
** [[Armoured recovery vehicle]] (ARV)
* Unarmoured fighting vehicles:
** ''[[Technical (fighting vehicle)|Technical]]'', a civilian truck mounting a support weapon
** ''[[Tachanka]]'', a horse-drawn machine gun carrier used in the [[Russian Civil War]]
** [[Katyusha]], a series of truck-mounted [[multiple rocket launcher]]s

=== Tank ===

[[Image:T72 Georgia.jpg |thumb|right|A [[T-72]] main battle tank clad in reactive armour bricks, in [[Georgia (country) |Georgian]] service.]]
{{main | tank}}

A '''tank''' is a [[Caterpillar track|tracked]], armoured combat vehicle ([[armoured fighting vehicle]]), designed primarily to engage enemy forces by the use of [[indirect fire|direct fire]]. A modern [[main battle tank]] is distinguished by its high level of firepower, mobility and armour protection relative to other vehicles of its era.  It can cross comparatively rough terrain at high speeds, but is fuel, maintenance, and ammunition-hungry and is [[Military logistics|logistically]] demanding.  It has the heaviest [[Vehicle armour |armour]] of any vehicle on the battlefield, and carries a powerful weapon that may be able to engage a wide variety of ground targets.  It is among the most versatile and fearsome weapons on the battlefield, valued for its [[fear |shock action]] against other troops and high survivability. 

See also: [[Tank classification]].

=== Armoured personnel carrier ===

[[Image:M113.jpg|thumb|right|The [[M113]], one of the most common tracked APCs, on duty during the [[Vietnam War]]]]
{{main | Armoured personnel carrier}}

'''Armoured personnel carriers''' (APCs) are light [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s for the transport of [[infantry]].  They usually have only a [[machine gun]] although variants carry [[recoilless rifle]]s, [[anti-tank guided missile]]s (ATGMs), or [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s.  They are not really designed to take part in a direct-fire battle, but to carry the troops to the battlefield safe from [[shrapnel]] and [[ambush]]. They may have [[wheel]]s or [[Caterpillar track|tracks]]. Examples include the American [[M113]] (tracked), the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[FV 432 AFV|FV 432]] (tracked) the [[France|French]] [[Véhicule de l'Avant Blindé|VAB]] (wheeled) and the Soviet [[BTR-60 |BTR]] (wheeled). The concept was fully realized by the Canadian Army in Normandy in 1944 with the invention of the Kangaroo.  Previous APCs were either semi-tracked (halftracks) or too small to effectively move a section/squad of infantry (such as the Universal Carrier).

=== Infantry fighting vehicle ===
{{main |infantry fighting vehicle}}

The first attempt to carry troops in an armoured tracked vehicle was made by the British in the First World War, a lengthened [[Mark I (tank)#Mark V|Mark V]] that could house a squad of infantry while still armed as a tank. Post-war, the idea was largely dropped in favour of trucks and lightly-armoured half-tracks, which were widely used during the Second World War. During WWII there were some experiments into heavily armoured carriers, such as the [[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroo]]s, converted by stripping turrets from tanks.  After the war, there was a shift away from half-tracks to tracked or wheeled armoured personnel carriers (APCs), usually armed with a machine gun for self-defence.

[[Image:Cv90 8.jpg|thumb|left|Swedish [[Combat Vehicle 90]], a modern IFV.]]

Modern IFVs are well-armed infantry carriers that allow the infantry inside to fight from within the vehicle.  They are different from earlier APCs by their heavier armament allowing them to give direct-fire support during an [[attack |assault]], firing ports allowing the infantry to fire [[firearms |personal weapons]] while mounted, and improved [[vehicle armour |armour]].  They are typically armed with a twenty-millimetre or larger [[autocannon]], and possibly with [[ATGM]]s.  IFVs are usually [[Caterpillar track|tracked]], but some wheeled vehicles fall into this category, too.  

Specially-equipped IFVs have taken on some of the roles of light tanks; they are used by reconnaissance organizations, and light IFVs are used by airborne units which must be able to fight without the heavy firepower of tanks.

By comparison the Israeli [[Merkava]] is a main battle tank with the ability to carry a section of infantry.

=== Self-propelled artillery and assault gun ===
{{main articles|[[self-propelled artillery]], [[assault gun]]}}

[[Image:Su152 2.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet [[SU-152]] assault gun, mounting a 152-mm gun.]]

Various types of [[artillery]] pieces have been given their own integral transport by mounting them on armoured, [[caterpillar track |tracked]] or wheeled chassis.  This lets them keep up with the pace of [[armoured warfare]], and gives them nominal protection from [[counter-battery]] or [[small arms]] fire.  Like towed artillery, a battery of [[self-propelled artillery|self-propelled guns]] must still set up in a relatively safe area to perform [[fire mission]]s, but they are able to relocate more quickly.

[[Assault gun]]s are self-propelled artillery pieces intended support [[infantry]] in the direct-fire role. They usually have a large-calibre gun capable of firing a heavy high-explosive [[shell (projectile) |shell]], effective against dug-in troops and fortifications.

=== Tank destroyer ===
{{main|tank destroyer}}
[[Image:JPz IV-70.jpg|thumb|left|German [[Jagdpanzer IV |Jagdpanzer IV/70 (V)]], mounting the Panther tank's 75-mm gun on a Panzer IV chassis.]]
Self-propelled anti-tank guns, or ''tank destroyers'', are used primarily to provide [[antitank]] support for [[infantry]] or [[tank]] units, in [[defence (military) | defensive]] or [[withdrawal (military) |withdrawal]] operations. They may mount a high-velocity anti-tank gun or sometimes an [[antitank guided missile]] launcher, or ATGM.

Tank destroyers cannot fulfil the many roles of tanks; they are much less flexible, and usually lacking in anti-infantry capability.  But they are much less expensive to manufacture, maintain, and resupply than tanks.

Gun-armed tank destroyers have been largely supplanted by the more general-purpose tanks since Second World War, but lightly-armoured ATGM carriers are used for supplementary long-range antitank capabilities, and to replace tanks in light or [[airborne forces|airborne]] forces.

=== Tankette ===

[[Image:TKS.jpg |thumb|right|Polish [[TKS]] tankette, armed with a single 7.92-mm machine gun.]]
{{main |tankette}}

A tankette is a small armoured fighting vehicle with a crew of one or two, similar to a tank, intended for infantry support or reconnaissance.  Most had no [[turret]] and were armed with one or two [[machine gun]]s, or rarely with a heavier gun or grenade launcher. Tankettes were produced between about [[1930]] and [[1935]], but the concept was abandonded because of its limited utility and vulnerability to antitank weapons. Their role was largely taken over by armoured cars.  

A classic design was the British [[Carden Loyd Tankette]]—many others were modelled after it.  Japan was among the most prolific users of tankettes, producing a number of designs, which they found useful for [[jungle warfare]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anton Drexler''' ([[June 13]], [[1884]] - [[February 24]], [[1942]]) was a machine-fitter before becoming a [[railway]] [[locksmith]] in [[Berlin]] in [[1902]]. He joined the Fatherland Party during [[World War I]]. He was a [[poet]] and a member of the [[Volk|völkisch]] agitators who, together with journalist [[Karl Harrer]], founded the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) in [[Munich]] with [[Gottfried Feder]] and [[Dietrich Eckart]] in [[1919]]. At the behest of [[Adolf Hitler]], who had joined the party shortly afterwards, Drexler changed the name to the National Socialist German Workers' Party ([[NSDAP]]) early in 1920. When Hitler finally wrested control of the party from Drexler in the autumn of 1921, Drexler had to content himself with the post of honorary chairman.

Drexler was also a member of a ''völkisch'' political club for affluent members of Munich society known as the [[Thule Society]].  His membership in the NSDAP ended when it was temporarily outlawed in 1923 following the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], in which Drexler had not taken part; he was elected to the Bavarian state parliament for another party in 1924 and had no part in the NSDAP's refounding in 1925. He rejoined only after Hitler had come to power in 1933. He received the party's &quot;blood badge&quot; in 1934 and was still occasionally used as a propaganda tool until about 1937, but was never again allowed any real power. He was largely forgotten by the time of his death.

      <comment>/* The horror of war */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''All Quiet on the Western Front''''' is a [[novel]] by [[Erich Maria Remarque]], a [[Germany|German]] veteran of [[World War I]], about the horrors of that war and also the deep detachment from German civilian life felt by many men returning from the front. The book was first published in German as ''Im Westen nichts Neues'' in January 1929. It sold a million copies within a year in Germany and a further million abroad. In 1930 the book was turned into an Oscar-winning [[Film|movie]] of the same name, directed by [[Lewis Milestone]]. In a usage unrelated to the novel, the phrase &quot;all quiet on the western front&quot; has become popular slang for a lack of action (in reference to the [[Phony War]] in [[World War II]]'s [[Western Front (WWII)|Western Front]]).

== Plot ==
{{spoiler}} 

The story follows the experiences of Paul Bäumer: a [[soldier]] who joined the [[Reichswehr|German army]] shortly after the start of the war. He arrives on the western front with his friends (Tjaden, Müller, and a number of other characters) and meets Stanislaus Katczinsky. Kat soon becomes Paul's [[mentor]] and teaches him about the realities of war. Paul and Kat swiftly became almost brothers, bonded by the hardships of the war.

Paul and his friends have to endure day after day of non-stop [[bombardment]]. Eventually it all becomes clear to him: war is entirely pointless. All his friends say that they are fighting the war for a few persons whom they have never met and most likely never will. They are the only people that can gain anything from this war, not Paul and his friends.

The book focuses not on [[hero|heroic]] stories of [[bravery]] as do so many other war stories, but rather gives a realistic view of the hell in which the soldiers found themselves. The [[monotony]], the constant [[artillery]] fire, the struggle to find food, and the overarching role of chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers, all are described in detail. Remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead, emotionally depleted and hardened. &quot;We are not youth any longer. We don't want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing from ourselves, from our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces.&quot;

Paul receives a period of leave from the army, and returns home temporarily. He finds it difficult to understand people at home anymore. While all the soldiers at the front wish for nothing more than peace, knowing that they are losing the war, people back home talk about marching on [[Paris]]. He is also indifferent to the significance of any of the battles. Battles have no names. Rather, one after another they offer a chance for him to be killed. Battle seems to be waged only to gain pitifully small pieces of land.

== Themes ==
There are many central themes in the book. Among them is that war is total nonsense. For example, none of the characters have ever seen a Frenchman before the war, much less have reason to kill them, but that is now what they are doing. Some of the soldiers ponder how the war was started, what is it for, and who it benefits. Nobody has any answers.

=== The horror of war ===
The main theme in ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' is the brutality of war. The archetypical war novel romanticizes war and extolls the heroes of the story, however this book shows a vivid, realistic, and horrible portrait of war. [[World War I]] saw the development of many new horrible innovations such as [[poison gas]], [[machine guns]], and [[tanks]]; all of which made killing easier and even more impersonal. The novel shows these weapons being used for butchery on a grand scale; for instance, battles lasting for four months. 

Paul describes the horrors of war throughout the book. The trenches and fortifications are shelled continually, poison gas blankets the [[battlefield]], [[snipers]] shoot at anyone with their head above ground. Finally, the French troops come and the German lines disintegrate. Vivid descriptions are presented throughout the book. Nothing short of being there could show the sheer numbers of dead and wounded every day in the war. 

The day Paul is killed was otherwise militarily uneventful, with the German army despatches merely noting ''Im Westen nichts Neues'' - &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; in the original, evocative translation (by A. W. Wheen in 1929). However, a literal translation reveals a different kind of irony - the dispatches on the day of Paul's death read &quot;Nothing New on the Western Front&quot;.

=== Effect on soldiers ===
Another of the central themes is how war completely ruins soldiers. Physically, they are in constant danger of being shot and bombed. The never-ending attacks and counter-attacks destroy their nerves. They live in unending fear and in atrocious conditions: inhabiting muddy earthen dug-outs infested with rats, alongside rotting corpses, having no food or water for days on end. They are forced to deal with the emotional shock of watching the violent deaths of their friends. If war does not actually kill the soldiers fighting it, the physical and mental anguish of war destroys them. Paul finds much to his horror when he returns home that he can no longer feel [[joy]], even in simple acts of pleasure like reading. The soldiers metaphorically change from humans into animals.

=== Nature ===
The landscape on the front is barren, but when Paul goes on leave, he sees nature. Nature represents escape, it is beautiful and pure. When traveling by train, Paul describes the beautiful mountains and plains of Germany. He wonders why this nature is being destroyed on the front, he wants to preserve this beauty not destroy it. Also, when he sees the French countryside, he sees it is not different from the German countryside, why should he destroy this either? When wanting to change the tone of the book to a nice tone, the author uses nature as a tool to achieve that.

Paul and his comrades from the trenches cross a river to get together with some young French women who live in a farm house away from the front. For a short period of time, the soldiers are taken away from the war, the trenches, and the destruction and death that has been part of their lives for many months.

==Adaptations==
=== Film ===
In [[1930]], an [[United States|American]] film of the novel was made, directed by [[Lewis Milestone]]. The screenplay was by [[Maxwell Anderson]], [[George Abbott]], [[Del Andrews]], [[C. Gardner Sullivan]], with uncredited work by [[Walter Anthony]] and Milestone. It stars [[Louis Wolheim]], [[Lew Ayres]], [[John Wray (actor)|John Wray]], [[Arnold Lucy]] and [[Ben Alexander]].

The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in [[1930]] for its producer [[Carl Laemmle Jr.]], and an [[Academy Award for Directing]] for [[Lewis Milestone]]. It also received two further nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], for [[Arthur Edeson]], and [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Writing Achievement]] for Abbott, Anderson and Andrews.

For many viewers, the film remains harrowing today, and its battle scenes are often considered extremely realistic even by contemporary standards.  

The film has been selected for preservation by the United States [[National Film Registry]]. In the late 20th Century and early 21st the United States Library of Congress undertook an exhaustive restoration of the film, which is vastly superior in sound and picture quality to most other extant prints. 

===TV film===
In [[1979]], the film was remade for television by [[Delbert Mann]]. The remake is generally considered less successful than the original and received little acclaim.

===Stage===
A 2 hour stage adaptation by [[Robin Kingsland]] was at the [[Nottingham Playhouse]] 11th to 25th [[February]] [[2006]] [http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2006/02/15/all_quiet_playhouse_review_event_feature.shtml].

== Sequel ==
{{main|The Road Back}}

''[[The Road Back]]'', another book written by Erich Maria Remarque, is about a different group of soldiers trying to cope with postwar Germany: dealing with the defeated German society after the war, trying to go to school, and trying to live a normal life.

The book and film were both banned during [[Nazi]] rule, and Remarque was stripped of his German citizenship in 1938.

[[Academic]] institutions often face the charge of '''academic elitism''', sometimes called the [[Ivory Tower]]. It is often used in parallel with [[Ivy League]] institutions.

== Description ==

'''Academic elitism''' suggests that in highly competitive academic environments only those individuals who have engaged in [[scholarly method|scholarship]] are deemed to have anything worthwhile to say, or do.
It suggests that individuals who have not engaged in  such scholarship are [[Crank (person)|cranks]]. It is possible, though, to value serious scholarship without being an academic elitist, of course. A lesser and broader form of this, [[intellectual elitism]], exists in non-academic circles, so academic elitism might also be viewed as a further extreme of intellectual elitism, depending upon one's perspective. 

The tendency towards academic elitism is most pronounced in highly competitive and highly regarded environments. The [[peer review]] of academia process is ocassionaly cited as suppressing dissent against &quot;[[mainstream]]'&quot; theories (part of an overall system of ''[[suppression of dissent|suppression of intellectual dissent]]''). Some [[Science and technology studies|sociologists of science]] argue that peer review makes the ability to publish susceptible to control by [[elite]]s and to personal jealousy. Reviewers tend to be especially critical of [[conclusion]]s that contradict their own [[view]]s, and lenient towards those that accord with them. At the same time, elite scientists are more likely than less established ones to be sought out as referees, particularly by high-prestige journals or [[publisher]]s. As a result, it has been argued, ideas that harmonize with the elite's are more likely to see print and to appear in premier journals than are iconoclastic or revolutionary ones, which accords with [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well-known observations regarding scientific revolutions.

The tendency towards academic elitism is noticable in some [[education system]]s (particularly in developed countries). More attention and resources are afforded to students who are deemed most intelligent at an early age. This inequality tends to further separate the elite from the remainder of society. [[Streaming]] systems include branded institutions, gifted classes, and other elite student groups. Countries with extensive private school systems also exemplify this trend.

=== Arguments against ===

* It is an inherently exclusionary process
* It serves to hamper the advancement of human knowledge by ignoring potentially valid ideas
* It encourages waste through the development of a winner-takes-all mentality
* Academic institutions are unreasonably shielded from [[economic competition]] by government funding programs
* Selection processes are unfairly biased towards certain groups
* It alienates those who are not of the elite and discourages them from participating in decision-making

=== Arguments for ===

* [[Elitism]] is an illusion which masks an inherent human tendency to group by abilities and interests
* Human societies are best advanced by those who are most willing and able to participate in academic study
* Human societies require a vetting process that leads people to roles that will yield the most efficient management of societal resources.

== Writings, authors, and books==

Authors &amp;mdash; including (but not limited to) ''[[Aldous Huxley]]'', ''[[George Orwell]]'' ([[Social Democrat]]), and ''[[Ayn Rand]]'' &amp;mdash;  have explored both sides of [[Social Elitism]] through [[Academia]]/[[Intelligentsia]]. They present theoretical examples of the [[Dystopian]] societies which might result from either extreme support or extreme undermining of elitism. For example, George Orwell has written several books on the subject, such as [[Nineteen_Eighty-Four|1984]] and [[Animal Farm]], where there are characters who take the role of a '[[Vanguard]]', acting FOR&amp;mdash;or on the behalf OF&amp;mdash;their society, who turn to them for everything, or rely on them. It usually ends up with them making some mistakes or abusing their trust, while going straight at a task they cannot comprehend, because they are stubbornly believing in themselves.

An '''African American''' (also '''Afro-American''', '''Black American''', '''American-African, is a member of an [[ethnic group]] in the [[United States]] whose ancestors, usually in predominant part, were indigenous to [[Africa]]. Many African Americans have [[European]] and/or [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ancestry as well. Some have [[Asian]] ancestry too. The term refers specifically to black African ancestry; not, for example, to white or Arab African ancestry, such as Moroccan or white South African ancestry. Blacks from non-African countries such as [[Haiti]], [[Cuba]], or [[Australia]] are theoretically referred to by their nation of origin and not African American, but in general the cultural assumption in the U.S. is that if a person is black, he or she is &quot;African American.&quot;

==Nomenclature==
The term &quot;African American&quot; has been in common usage in the United States since the late [[1980s]], when greater numbers of African Americans began to adopt the term self-referentially. [[Malcolm X]] favored the term &quot;African American&quot; over &quot;Negro&quot; and used the term at an [[OAAU]] (Organization of Afro American Unity) meeting in the early [[1960s]], saying, &quot;Twenty-two million African-Americans - that's what we are - Africans who are in America.&quot; Former NBA player/coach [[Lenny Wilkens]] is another who used the term as a teenager when filling a job application. Many blacks began to abandon the term &quot;Afro-American&quot;, which had become popular in the [[1960s]] and [[1970s|'70s]], for &quot;African-American,&quot; because they desired an unabbreviated expression of their African heritage that could not be mistaken or derided as an allusion to the [[afro]] hairstyle.  The term became increasingly popular, and by the 1980s, [[Jesse Jackson]] and others pressed for its adoption and acceptance.  Users of the term argued that &quot;African-American&quot; was more in keeping with the nation's immigrant tradition of so-called &quot;hyphenated Americans&quot;, who were known by terms like &quot;[[Irish-American]]&quot;, or &quot;[[Chinese-American]]&quot;, &quot;[[Polish-American]]&quot;), which link people with their, or their ancestors', geographic points of origin. 

Terms used at various points in American history include ''[[Negro]]es'', ''[[colored]]'', ''[[blacks]]'' and ''Afro-Americans''. ''Negro'' and ''colored'' were common until the late  [[1960s]], but are now less commonly used and considered derogatory. ''African American'', ''black'' and, to a lesser extent, ''Afro-American'' are used interchangeably today, but their precise meanings and connotations are in dispute.  

The term ''African American'' is sometimes problematic because of its imprecise [[cultural]] and geographic meaning. It also means that the people it is refering to are black. The term as originally applied refers to only those descended from a small number of colonial [[indentured servitude|indentured servants]] and the estimated 500,000 Africans taken to the U.S. as slaves (of approximately 11 million Africans taken to the western hemisphere in general). In slightly broader usage, the term can include Indians and Afro-Latino [[immigrants]] whose African ancestors also survived the Middle Passage, recent African immigrants, children of immigrants, with American citizenship, but these groups tend to use the ethnic terms ''Latino'' or ''Hispanic'', or identify themselves by their countries of origin (i.e., as [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] or [[Jamaican]] instead of African American). The term does not include white, Indian or Arab immigrants from the African continent, as they are not generally considered 'Africans'. Racial identification has always been somewhat arbitary, depending less on ancestry and more on community membership. Thus large numbers of African Americans &quot;passed&quot; into the white community and they and their descendants are not considered African American. The father of Senator [[Barak Obama]] was a man from Kenya, his mother was of European descent; he was raised in Hawaii and Indonesia and eventually chose to identify with the African American community, and has become an important leader.  Many other political leaders, especially in New York City, are descended from West Indians, including [[Colin Powell]] and [[Shirley Chisholm]]. [[Walter White]], longtime NAACP leader, appeared white, a point he emphasized in his autobiography ''A Man Called White'' (p. 3): &quot;I am a Negro. My skin is white, my eyes are blue, my hair is blond. The traits of my race are nowhere visible upon me.&quot;[http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0820316989&amp;id=bbMKSGD_TpUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=Walter+White+NAACP&amp;sig=LIfEA99_uvt-pOy5yXKb1Q2Ey-s] 

In some contexts, the term ''African American'' has been used to refer to people such as the [[black Loyalist]]s who never gave their allegance to the USA - in this context &quot;American&quot; refers to the American continents.

==Current Demographics==
[[Image:USA 2000 black density.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Population density of African Americans in 2000]]
According to [[2003]] U.S. [[Census]] figures, some 37.1 million African Americans live in the United States, comprising 12.9 percent of the total population. At the time of the [[2000]] Census, 54.8 percent of African Americans lived in the [[Southern United States|South]]. In that year, 17.6 percent of African Americans lived in the Northeast and 18.7 percent in the Midwest, while only 8.9 percent lived in the western states. Almost 88 percent of African Americans lived in metropolitan areas in 2000. With over 2 million black residents, [[New York City]] had the largest black urban population in the United States in 2000. Among cities of 100,000 or more, [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], [[Indiana]], had the highest percentage of black residents of any U.S. city in 2000, with 85 percent, followed closely by [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Michigan]], with 83 percent. [[Atlanta, Georgia]], has a large African-American population of about 65 percent.  The nation's capital, [[Washington, D.C.]], had a 60 percent black population.

==African American history==
''Main article: [[African American history]]''
  
Blacks in America, like their White counterparts, are composed of many diverse ethnic groups.  Over 40 identifiable ethnic groups from 25 different kingdoms were sold to the United States during the Atlantic Slave trade.  These people came from an area spanning from present day [[Senegal]] all the way to [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] as well as the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[colonies]] of [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]].  Over time, Africans in America formed a new and common identity focused on their mutual condition in America as opposed to cultural and historic ties to Africa.  Africans were sold and traded into bondage and shipped to the American South from [[1619]].  In [[1807]], the importation of slaves by U.S. citizens became illegal, yet the practice continued. By [[1860]], there were 3.5 million enslaved Africans in the [[Southern United States]], and another 500,000 Africans lived free across the country. [[Slavery]] was a controversial issue in American society and politics. The growth of [[abolitionism]], which opposed the institution of slavery, culminated in the [[1860]] election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as [[President of the United States]], and was one reason for the secession of the [[Confederate States of America]], which lead to the [[American Civil War]] ([[1861]] - [[1865]]).
  
The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of [[1863]] declared all slaves in the Confederacy free under U.S. law.  It did not, however, apply to people enslaved in territories that were still in the Union, and thus did not immediately free a single enslaved person, since U.S. law held no sway over the Confederacy at the time. The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1865, freed all enslaved people, including those in states that had not seceded. During [[Reconstruction]], African Americans in the South obtained the right to vote and to hold public office, as well as a number of other civil rights they previously had been denied. However, when [[Reconstruction]] ended in [[1877]], southern, European American landowners reinstituted a regime of [[Disenfranchising|disenfranchisement]] and [[racial segregation]], and with it a wave of terrorism and repression, including [[lynchings]] and other [[vigilante]] violence.

The desperate conditions of African Americans in the South that sparked the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of the early [[20th century]], combined with a growing African American intellectual and cultural elite in the [[Northern United States]], led to a movement to fight violence and [[discrimination]] against African Americans that, like [[abolitionism]] before it, crossed racial lines. One of the most prominent of these groups, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], galvanized by outspoken journalist and activist [[Ida B. Wells Barnett]], led an anti-lynching crusade. In the 1950s, the organization mounted a series of calculated legal challenges to overturn [[Jim Crow]] segregation, culminating in the landmark ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]] of Topeka, Kansas'' decision.

The [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''Brown v. Board'' was one of defining moments of the modern-day [[Civil Rights Movement]].  It was part of a long-term strategy to strike down Jim Crow segregation in public education, the hospitality industry, public transportation, employment and housing, granting equal access to African Americans and ensuring their right to vote.  The movement reached its peak in the [[1960s]] under leaders such as Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Whitney Young]], and [[Roy Wilkins]], Sr. At the same time, [[Nation of Islam]] spokesman [[Malcolm X]] and, later, [[Stokely Carmichael]], the [[Black Panther Party]], and the [[Republic of New Africa]] called for African Americans to embrace [[black nationalism]] and black self-empowerment, propounding ideas of African (black) unity and solidarity and [[pan-Africanism]].

==Contemporary issues==
{{NPOV-section}}
{{cleanup-date|November 2005}}

''Main article: [[African American contemporary issues]]''
  
African Americans significantly have improved their social and economic standing since the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and recent [[decade]]s have witnessed the expansion of a robust, African American [[middle class]] across the United States.  African Americans as a group remain at a pronounced economic, educational, and social disadvantage relative to whites. Economically, the median income of African Americans is roughly 55 percent of that of European Americans{{fact}}. Persistent social, economic, and political issues for many African Americans include inadequate [[health care]] access and delivery; housing{{fact}}, [[education]], policing, [[criminal justice]] and [[employment]]; [[crime]]; [[poverty]]; and [[substance abuse]]. They are also more likely to be [[prison|incarcerated]]. African Americans also have higher prevalence of some chronic [[health]] conditions and out-of-wedlock births relative to the general population. These problems and potential remedies have been the subject of intense [[public policy]] debate in the United States in general, and within the African American community in particular.

==Culture==
''Main article: [[African American culture]]''
 
African American culture is an amalgam of influences, including [[African]], [[Caribbean]], [[European]], and [[Latino]] cultures. From its music and dance, to speech, demeanor, and foodways, African American culture bears the strong imprint of West Africa, particularly in rural portions of the [[Deep South]] and [[Sea Islands]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]].
 
[[African American music]] is one of the most pervasive African American cultural influences in the United States today. [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[R&amp;B]], [[funk]], and other contemporary American musical forms evolved from [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[gospel music]]. [[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) is a dialect of English spoken by many African Americans to varying degrees.
 
Many African American authors have written stories, poems, and essays influenced by their experiences as African Americans, and [[African American literature]] is a major genre in American literature. Famous examples include [[Langston Hughes]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Ralph Ellison]], [[Toni Morrison]], and [[Maya Angelou]].

==The term ''African American''==
  
===Political overtones===

The term ''African American'' carries important political overtones. Previous terms used to identify Americans of African ancestry were conferred upon the group by whites and were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which became tools of white supremacy and oppression. There developed among blacks in America a growing desire for a term of their own choosing.
  
With the political consciousness that emerged from the political and social ferment of the late [[1960s]] and early [[1970s]], ''Negro'' fell into disfavor among many African Americans. It had taken on a moderate, accommodationist, even [[Uncle Tom]]&lt;nowiki&gt;ish&lt;/nowiki&gt;, connotation. In this period, a growing number of blacks in the U.S., particularly African American youth, celebrated their [[blackness]] and their historical and cultural ties with the African continent. The [[Black_nationalism#Black_Power|Black Power]] movement defiantly embraced ''black'' as a group identifier&amp;mdash;a term they themselves had repudiated only two decades earlier&amp;mdash;a term often associated in English with things negative and undesirable, proclaiming, &quot;Black is beautiful.&quot; 
  
In this same period, others favored the term ''Afro-American''; this particular term never gained much traction, but by the [[1990s]], the term ''African American'' had emerged as the leading choice of self-referential term. Just as other ethnic groups in American society historically had adopted names descriptive of their families' geographical points of origin (such as ''[[Italian-American]]'', ''[[Irish-American]]'', ''[[Polish-American]]''), many blacks in America expressed a preference for a similar term. Because of the historical circumstances surrounding the capture, enslavement and systematic attempts to de-Africanize blacks in the U.S. under chattel slavery, most African Americans are unable to trace their ancestry to a specific African nation; hence, the entire continent serves as a geographic marker.

For many, ''African American'' is more than a name expressive of cultural and historical roots. The term expresses African pride and a sense of kinship and solidarity with others of the African [[diaspora]]&amp;mdash;an embracing of the notion of pan-Africanism earlier enunciated by prominent African thinkers such as [[Marcus Garvey]], [[W.E.B. Dubois]] and, later, [[George Padmore]].  
  
A discussion of the term ''African American'' and related terms can be found in the journal article &quot;The Politicization of Changing Terms of Self Reference Among American Slave Descendants&quot; in ''American Speech'' v 66 is 2 Summer 1991 p. 133-46.

===Who is African American?===
To be considered African American in the [[United States|United States of America]], not even half of one's ancestry need to be black African. The nation's answer to the question &quot;Who is black?&quot; long has been that a &quot;black&quot; is any person with any known African ancestry. This definition reflects the long experience with [[racism]], [[white supremacy]], [[slavery]], and, later, with [[Jim Crow laws]].
  
In the [[Southern United States]], it became known as the ''[[one-drop rule]]'', meaning that a single drop of &quot;black blood&quot; makes a person &quot;black&quot;. Some courts have called it the ''traceable amount rule'', and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] call it the ''hypo-descent rule'', meaning that racially mixed persons are assigned the status of the subordinate group. This definition emerged from the American South to become America's national definition, generally accepted by whites and blacks -- but for different reasons. White supremacists, whose motivation was [[racism|racist]], considered anyone with African ancestry tainted, inherently inferior morally and intellectually and, thus, subordinate. During slavery, there was also a strong economic incentive to maximize the number of individuals who could be owned, bred, worked, traded and sold outright as human chattel. The designation of anyone possessing any trace of African ancestry as &quot;black&quot;, and, therefore, of subordinate status to whites, guaranteed a source of cheap labor during slavery and for decades afterward. For African Americans, the one-drop system of racial designation was a significant factor in ethnic solidarity. African Americans generally shared a common lot in society and, therefore, common cause -- regardless of their ethnic admixture and social and economic stratification. 
  
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] formalized the legal status of this rule in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' ([[1896]]), where the Court affirmed the legality of [[racial segregation]] and upheld the State of [[Louisiana]]'s ruling that, despite being 7/8 white, [[Homer Plessy]]'s one black great-grandparent rendered him legally non-white and, therefore, subject to being barred from whites-only railway carriages.

[[Caucasoid]] peoples, [[India|Indians]], [[Asians]] and [[Arab]]s are traditionally not considered African American, though they or their [[ancestor]]s may have [[emigrate|emigrated]] from the African continent after generations of residence. In relatively rare cases when [[South Africa|South African]] whites, Caucasoid [[North Africa|North African]]s or [[Asia]]n immigrants from Africa living in America have self-identified as African American in an attempt to benefit  from [[Affirmative Action]] or other entitlement programs, their claims generally have not been upheld.
  
In the [[1980s]], parents of mixed-race children began to organize and lobby for the addition of a more inclusive term of racial designation that would reflect the heritage of their offspring.  As a result, the term ''[[biracial]]'' has become more widely used and accepted to classify people of mixed race.

===Terms no longer in common use===
  
The term ''[[Negro]]'', which was widely used until the [[1960s]], today increasingly is considered passé and inappropriate or derogatory. It is still fairly commonly used by older individuals, in the Deep South, and by medical/anthropological texts. Once widely considered acceptable, ''Negro'' fell into disfavor for reasons already herein stated. The self-referential term of preference for ''Negro'' became ''black''.
  
''Negroid'' is a term used by European anthropologists first in the [[18th century]] to describe indigenous Africans and their descendants throughout the African diaspora. As with most descriptors of [[race]] based on inconsistent, unscientific phenotypical standards, the term is controversial and imprecise.  Because of its similarity to ''Negro'', growing numbers of blacks have substituted the term ''Africoid'' which, unlike ''Negroid'', encompasses the phenotypes of all indigenous African peoples.
  
Other largely defunct, seldom used terms to refer to African Americans are ''[[mulatto]]'' and ''[[colored]]''. Even so, the use of the word &quot;colored&quot; can still be found today in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or [[NAACP]].  The American use of the term ''mulatto'' originally was used to mean the offspring of a &quot;pure African black&quot; and a &quot;pure European white&quot;. The Latin root of the word is ''mulo'', as in &quot;[[mule]]&quot;, implying incorrectly that, like mules, which are [[horse]]-[[donkey]] [[hybrid]]s, mulattoes are sterile crosses of two different species. For example, in the early [[20th century]], African American leaders such as [[Booker T. Washington]] and [[Frederick Douglass]], who had enslaved blacks as mothers and white fathers, were referred to as mulattoes. While not as common as &quot;mixed&quot; or &quot;biracial,&quot; or even &quot;multiracial,&quot; ''mulatto'' is still sometimes used to refer to people of mixed parentage and, despite its origin, is not considered inherently derogatory.
  
The term ''quadroon'' referred to a person of one-fourth African descent, for example, someone born to a [[Whites|Caucasian]] father and a mulatto mother. Someone of one-eighth African descent technically was an ''octoroon'', although the term often was used to refer to any white person with even a hint of black ancestry.
  
''Mulatto'' and terms with the ''-roon'' suffix persisted in a social context for a number of decades, but by the mid twentieth century, they no longer were in common use. With the end of slavery, there was no longer a strong commercial incentive to classify blacks by their African-European ancestral admixture. The occasional use of these terms, however, does still persist in electronic media, literature and in some social settings.

===Criticisms of the Term===

Some criticism has arisen with the use of the term &quot;African American&quot;. To be African-American, some would argue that an individual would have to be born in Africa and then immigrate to U.S. and obtain citizenship. So an overwhelming majority of Black Americans would not be African-American, but of  African American descent. Some inaccuracies also exist with the term. It is associated with black people however one could be completely white and still technically be &quot;African American&quot; if they were born in Africa and immigrated to the U.S.

However, some counter that the &quot;hyphenated American&quot; is used to describe one's national origin, so any person born in Africa would take on the name of their country.  For example, indivuals from Nigeria would be called Nigerian-American as it describes their national origin as opposed to African-American.  The term African-American is preferred among many because although the regional/national origin of black Americans in Africa is not traceable, due to slavery, the continent of Africa provides a descriptive term of themselves.

[[Image:Annunciation.jpg|right|250px|thumbnail|The Annunciation - the Angel [[Gabriel]] announces to [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] that she will bear [[Jesus]] ([[El Greco]], [[1575]])]] 
An '''angel''' is ethereal being found in many [[religion]]s, whose duties are to assist and serve [[God]]. They typically act as messengers, as believed in the main three monotheistic religions.  Some scholars now believe that the introduction to angelology as well as demonology may have been through the [[Iranian]] ([[Persian]]) prophet [[Zoroaster]], via the [[Persian Empire]] who had come in contact with Babylonian [[Jew]]s[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=147&amp;letter=Z&amp;search=zoroaster]. 

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] word originated from [[Latin]], ''angelus'', which is itself derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄγγελος, ''ángelos'', meaning &quot;messenger&quot; (double gamma &quot;γγ&quot; is pronounced &quot;ng&quot; in Greek). The closest [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for angel is מלאך, ''mal'ach'' {{strong|4397}}, also meaning &quot;messenger&quot;. &quot;Angel&quot; is also used in the English Version of the [[Bible]] for the following three Hebrew words:
* אביר, ''abbir'' {{strong|47}}, [[Psalms]] 78:25 (lit. &quot;mighty&quot;)
* אלהים, ''[[Elohim]]'' {{strong|430}}, Psalms 8:5
* the obscure שנאן,  ''shin'an'' {{strong|8136}}, in Psalms 68:17

== Angels in the [[Tanakh]] ==
[[Image:Statue at Metairie Cemetery.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Statue]] of an angel at a [[cemetery]] in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]], [[Louisiana]].]]
The Biblical name for angel, מלאך ('malakh&quot;), obtained the further signification of &quot;angel&quot; only through the addition of God's name, as &quot;angel of the Lord,&quot; or &quot;angel of God&quot; (Zech. xii. 8). Other appellations are &quot;Sons of God&quot;, ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] vi. 4; [[Book of Job|Job]], i. 6 [R. V. v. 1]) and &quot;the Holy Ones&quot; (Psalms lxxxix. 6, 8).

According to [[Judaism|Jewish]] interpretation, '''Elohim'' is almost entirely reserved for the one true God; but at times '' '[[Elohim]]'' (powers), ''bnē 'Elohim'', ''bnē Elim'' (sons of gods)(i.e. members of the class of divine beings) were general terms for beings with great power (i.e. judges or alternately, some kind of super powerful human beings). Hence they came to be used collectively of super-human beings, distinct from [[Yahweh]] and, therefore, inferior and ultimately subordinate (e.g. Genesis 6:2; Job 1:6; Psalms 8:5).
''See also:'' [[Names of God in Judaism]]

Angels are referred to as &quot;holy ones&quot; ([[Zechariah]] 14:5) and &quot;watchers&quot; ([[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 4:13). They are spoken of as the &quot;host of [[heaven]]&quot; ([[Deuteronomy]] 17:3) or of &quot;Yahweh&quot; ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 5:14). The &quot;hosts,&quot; צבאות ''Sebaoth'' in the title ''Yahweh Sebaoth'' (alternatively, ''Adonai Tzivo'ot''), Lord of Hosts, were probably at one time identified with the angels. The identification of the &quot;hosts&quot; with the [[stars]] comes to the same thing; the stars were thought of as being closely connected with angels. However, YHWH is very jealous of the distinction between Himself and angels, and consequently, the Hebrews were forbidden by Moses to worship the &quot;host of heaven&quot;. It is probable that the &quot;hosts&quot; were also identified with the armies of Israel, whether this army is human, or angelic. The New Testament often speaks of &quot;spirits,&quot; πνεύματα ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 1:4).

Prior to the emergence of [[monotheism]] in [[Israel]] the idea of an angel was the ''Mal'akh Yahweh'', Angel of the Lord, or ''Mal'akh Elohim'', Angel of God. The ''Mal'akh Yahweh'' is an appearance or manifestation of Yahweh in the form of a man, and the term ''Mal'akh Yahweh'' is used interchangeably with Yahweh ([[cf.]] [[Exodus]] 3:2, with 3:4; 13:21 with 14:19). Those who see the ''Mal'akh Yahweh'' say they have seen God (Genesis 32:30; [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 13:22). The ''Mal'akh Yahweh'' (or ''Elohim'') appears to [[Abraham]], [[Hagar]], [[Moses]], [[Gideon (Judges)|Gideon]], &amp;c., and leads the Israelites in the ''Pillar of Cloud'' (Exodus 3:2). The phrase ''Mal'akh Yahweh'' may have been originally a courtly circumlocution for the Divine King; but it readily became a means of avoiding [[anthropomorphism]], and later on, when angels were classified, the ''Mal'akh Yahweh'' meant an angel of distinguished rank. The identification of the ''Mal'akh Yahweh'' with the ''[[Logos]]'', or [[Christology|Second Person]] of the [[Trinity]], is not indicated by the references in the Hebrew scriptures; but the idea of a Being partly identified with God, and yet in some sense distinct from him, illustrates a tendency of Jewish religious thought to distinguish persons within the unity of the deity. Christians think that this foreshadows the doctrine of the Trinity, whereas Kabbalist Jews would show how it developed into [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] theological thought and imagery.

In earlier literature the ''Mal'akh Yahweh'' or ''Elohim'' is almost the only angel mentioned. However, there are a few passages which speak of subordinate superhuman beings other than the ''Mal'akh Yahweh'' or ''Elohim''. There are the ''[[Cherub|cherubim]]'' who guard [[Garden of Eden]]. In Genesis 18, 19. (J) the appearance of Yahweh to Abraham and [[Lot (biblical)|Lot]] is connected with three, afterwards two, men or messengers; but possibly in the original form of the story Yahweh appeared alone (Cf. 18:1 with 18:2, and note change of number in 19:17). At [[Bethel (Israel)|Bethel]], [[Jacob]] sees the angels of God on the [[Jacob's Ladder (Bible)|ladder]] (Genesis 28:12), and later on they appear to him at [[Mahanaim]] (Genesis 32:1). In all these cases the angels, like the ''Mal'akh Yahweh'', are connected with or represent a [[theophany]]. Similarly the &quot;man&quot; who wrestles with Jacob at [[Peniel]] is identified with God (Genesis 32:24, 30). In [[Isaiah]] 6 the [[Seraph|seraphim]], superhuman beings with six wings, appear as the attendants of Yahweh. Thus, the pre-exilic literature rarely mentions angels, or other superhuman beings other than Yahweh and manifestations of Yahweh; the pre-exilic [[prophet]]s hardly mention angels. An angel of [[Books of Kings|I Kings]] 13:18 might be the ''Mal'akh Yahweh'', as in 19:5, cf. 7, or the passage, at any rate in its present form, may be exilic or post-exilic. Nevertheless we may well suppose that [[polytheist]]s in [[ancient Israel]] believed in superhuman beings other than Yahweh, but that the [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] writers have mostly suppressed references to them as unedifying.

Once the doctrine of monotheism was formally expressed, in the period immediately before and during the Exile (Deuteronomy 6:4-5 and Isaiah 43:10), we find angels prominent in the [[Book of Ezekiel]]. [[Ezekiel]], as a prophet of the Exile, may have been influenced by the hierarchy of supernatural beings in the [[Babylonian and Assyrian religion|Babylonian religion]], and perhaps even by the [[angelology]] of [[Zoroastrianism]] (it is not, however, certain that these doctrines of Zoroastrianism were developed at so early a date). Ezekiel 9 gives elaborate descriptions of cherubim (a class, or type of angels); and in one of his visions, he sees seven angels execute the judgment of God upon Jerusalem. As in Genesis, they are styled &quot;men&quot;; ''mal'akh'', for &quot;angel&quot;, does not occur in Ezekiel. Somewhat later, in the visions of [[Zechariah]], angels play a great part; they are sometimes spoken of as &quot;men&quot;, sometimes as ''mal'akh'', and the ''Mal'akh Yahweh'' seems to hold a certain primacy among them (Zecharias 1:11). The [[Satan]] also appears to prosecute (so to speak) the High Priest before the divine tribunal (Zecharias 3:1). Similarly in the [[Book of Job|Job]] the ''bne Elohim'', sons of God, appear as attendants of God, and amongst them, Satan (Hebrew ''ha satan''), again in the role of public prosecutor, the defendant being Job (Job 1, 2. Cf. [[Books of Chronicles|I Chronicles]] 21:1). Occasional references to &quot;angels&quot; occur in the Psalter (Pss. 91:11, 103:20 &amp;c.); they appear as ministers of God.

In Psalms 78:49 the &quot;evil angels&quot; of the [[Authorized Version]] conveys a false impression; it should be &quot;angels of evil&quot;, ''i.e.'' angels who inflict chastisement as ministers of God.

The seven angels of Ezekiel may be compared with the seven eyes of Yahweh in Zecharias 3:9, 4:10. The latter have been connected by Ewald and others with the later doctrine of seven chief angels (Tobit 12:15; Revelations 8:2), parallel to and influenced by the Ameshaspentas ([[Amesha Spenta]]), or seven great spirits of the [[Persian mythology]].

In the Priestly Code, c. [[400 BC]], there is no reference to angels, apart from the possible suggestion in the plural in Genesis 1:26.

During the [[Persian Empire|Persia]]n and Greek periods, the doctrine of angels underwent a great development, partly, at any rate, under foreign influences. In Daniel, c. [[160 BC]], 71 angels, usually spoken of as &quot;men&quot; or &quot;'''Angel-princes'''&quot;, appear as guardians or champions of the individual nations, defending them as God sits in council with them over the world; grades are implied, there are &quot;princes&quot; and &quot;chief&quot; or &quot;great princes&quot;; and the names of some angels are known, [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]], [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]; the latter is pre-eminent (Dan. 8:16; 10:13, 20-21), he is the guardian of Israel's leading [[Kingdom of Judah]]. Again in [[Tobit]] a leading part is played by [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], &quot;one of the seven holy angels&quot;. (Tob. 12:15.)

In Tobit, too, we find the idea of the [[demon]] or evil angel. In the canonical Hebrew/[[Aramaic]] scriptures, angels may inflict suffering as ministers of God, and Satan may act as accuser or tempter; but they appear as subordinates to God, fulfilling His will, and not as independent, morally evil agents. The statement (Job 4:18) that God &quot;charged his angels with folly&quot; applies to all angels. In Daniel, the princes, or guardian angels, of the heathen nations oppose Michael, the guardian angel of Judah. But in Tobit, we find [[Asmodeus]] the evil demon, τὸ πονηρὸν δαιμόνιον, who strangles Sarah's husbands, and also a general reference to &quot;a [[devil]] or evil spirit&quot;, πνεῦμα (Tobit 3:8, 17; 6:7).  

The Fall of the Angels is not properly a scriptural doctrine, though it is based on Gen. 6:2, as interpreted by the [[Book of Enoch]]. It is true that the ''bnē Elohim'' of that chapter are subordinate superhuman beings (cf. above), but they belong to a different order of thought from the angels of Judaism and of Christian doctrine; and the passage in no way suggests that the ''bne Elohim'' suffered any loss of status through their act.

The guardian angels of the nations in Daniel probably represent the gods of the heathen, and we have there the first step of the process by which these gods became evil angels, an idea expanded by [[John Milton|Milton]] in ''[[Paradise Lost]]''. The development of the doctrine of an organized hierarchy of angels belongs to the Jewish literature of the period [[200 BC]] to A.D. [[100]]. In Jewish apocalypses especially, the imagination ran riot on the rank, classes and names of angels; and such works as the various books of [[Enoch]] and  the [[Ascension of Isaiah]] supply much information on this subject.

=== Appearance of angels ===
In the [[Hebrew Bible]], angels often appear to people in the shape of humans of extraordinary beauty, and often are not immediately recognized as angels (Gen. xviii. 2, xix. 5; Judges, vi. 17, xiii. 6; II Sam. xxix. 9);  some fly through the air; some become invisible; sacrifices touched by them are consumed by fire; and they may disappear in sacrificial fire, like [[Elijah (prophet)|Elijah]], who rode to heaven in a fiery chariot. Angels, or the Angel, appeared in the flames of the [[Burning bush|thorn bush]] (Gen. xvi. 13; Judges, vi. 21, 22; II Kings, ii. 11; Ex. iii. 2). They are described as pure and bright as Heaven; consequently, they are said to be formed of fire, and encompassed by light (Job, xv. 15), as the Psalmist said (Ps. civ. 4, R. V.): &quot;Who makes winds his messengers; his ministers a flaming fire.&quot; Some verses in the
[[Apocrypha]] depict angels wearing blue or red robes but no such reference occurs in the
Protestant books.

Though superhuman, angels can assume human form; this is the earliest conception. Gradually, and especially in post-Biblical times, angels came to be bodied forth in a form corresponding to the nature of the mission to be fulfilled—generally, however, the human form. Angels bear drawn [[sword]]s or other destroying weapons in their hands—one carries an ink-horn by his side—and ride on horses (Num. xxii. 23, Josh. v. 13, Ezek. ix. 2, Zech. i. 8 et seq.). It is worth noting that these angels carry items that are contempory to the time in which they visit (perhaps angels are bound by the technology which humans have achieved). A terrible angel is the one mentioned in I Chron. xxi. 16, 30, as standing &quot;between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand&quot;. In the [[Book of Daniel]], reference is made to an angel &quot;clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz: his body also was like the [[beryl]], and his face as the appearance of [[lightning]], and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished [[brass]], and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude&quot; (Dan. x. 5, 6). This imagery is very similar to the description of Jesus in the book of Revelation.  Angels are thought to possess wings (Dan. ix. 21), as they are described in the Bible, and depicted in Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian art.  They are commonly depicted with [[halo (religious symbol)|halo]]s.

In [[Christian iconography]], the use of wings is an iconographic convention that is intended to denote the figure as a [[spirit]]. Depictions of angels in Christian art as winged human forms, unlike classical pagan depictions of the major deities, follow the iconic conventions of lesser winged gods, such as [[Eos]], [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]], [[Thanatos]] and [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]].   

Angels are portrayed as powerful and dreadful, endowed with wisdom and with knowledge of all earthly events, correct in their judgment, holy, but not infallible: they strive against each other, and God has to make peace between them. When their duties are not punitive, angels are beneficent to man (Ps. ciii. 20, lxxviii. 25; II Sam. xiv. 17, 20, xix. 28; Zech. xiv. 5; Job, iv. 18, xxv. 2).

The number of angels is enormous. [[Jacob]] meets a host of angels; [[Joshua]] sees the &quot;captain of the host of the Lord&quot;; God sits on His throne, &quot;all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on his left&quot;; the sons of God come &quot;to present themselves before the Lord&quot; (Gen. xxxii. 2; Josh. v. 14, 15; I Kings, xxii. 19; Job, i. 6, ii. 1; Ps. lxxxix. 6; Job, xxxiii. 23). The general conception is the one of [[Book of Job|Job]] (xxv. 3): &quot;Is there any number of his armies?&quot; In the book of Revelation, the number is &quot;a thousand thousands, and many tens of thousands&quot;.

Though the older writings usually mention one angel of the Lord, embassies to men as a rule comprised several messengers. The inference, however, is not to be drawn that God Himself or one particular angel was designated: the expression was given simply to God's power to accomplish through but one angel any deed, however wonderful.

Angels are referred to in connection with their special missions as, for instance, the &quot;angel which hath redeemed,&quot; &quot;an interpreter,&quot; &quot;the angel that destroyed,&quot; &quot;messenger of the covenant,&quot; &quot;angel of his presence,&quot; and &quot;a band of angels of evil&quot; (Gen. xlviii. 16; Job, xxxiii. 23; II Sam. xxiv. 16; Mal. iii. 1; Isa. lxiii. 9; Ps. lxxviii. 49, R. V.). When, however, the heavenly host is regarded in its most comprehensive aspect, a distinction may be made between [[cherub]]im, [[seraph]]im, ḥayyot (&quot;living creatures&quot;), ofanim (&quot;wheels&quot;), and arelim (another name for Thrones). God is described as riding on the cherubim and as &quot;the Lord of hosts, who dwelleth between the cherubim&quot;; while the latter guard the way of the [[Tree of Life]] (I Sam. iv. 4, Ps. lxxx. 2, Gen. iii. 24). The seraphim are described by [[Isaiah]] (vi. 2) as having six wings; and [[Ezekiel]] describes the ḥayyot (Ezek. i. 5 et seq.) and ''ofanim'' as heavenly beings who carry God's throne.

In post-Biblical times, the heavenly hosts became more highly organized (possibly as early as Zechariah [iii. 9, iv. 10]; certainly in Daniel), and there came to be various kinds of angels; some even being provided with names, as will be shown below.

=== Purpose ===
In the Bible, angels are a medium of God's power; they exist to execute God's will. Angels reveal themselves to individuals as well as to the whole nation, in order to announce events, either good or bad, affecting humans. Angels foretold to [[Abraham]] the birth of [[Isaac]], to [[Manoah]] the birth of [[Samson]], and to Abraham the destruction of [[Sodom]]. Guardian angels were mentioned, but not, as was later the case, as guardian spirits of individuals and nations. God sent an angel to protect the [[Hebrews|Hebrew people]] after their [[exodus]] from [[Egypt]], to lead them to the [[promised land]], and to destroy the hostile tribes in their way (Ex. 23.20, Num. 20.16).

In Judges (ii. 1) an angel of the Lord—unless here and in the preceding instances (compare Isa. xlii. 19, Ḥag. i. 13, Mal. iii. 1), a human messenger of God is meant—addressed the whole people, swearing to bring them to the promised land. An angel brought [[Elijah (prophet)|Elijah]] meat and drink (I Kings, xix. 5); and as God watched over [[Jacob]], so is every [[piety|pious]] person protected by an angel, who cares for him in all his ways (Ps. xxxiv. 7, xci. 11). There are angels militant, one of whom smites in one night the whole [[Assyria]]n army of 185,000 men (II Kings, xix. 35); messengers go forth from God &quot;in ships to make the careless [[Ethiopia]]ns afraid&quot; (Ezek. xxx. 9); the enemy is scattered before the angel like chaff (Ps. xxxv. 5, 6).

Avenging angels are mentioned, such as the one in II Sam. xxiv. 15, who annihilates thousands. It would seem that the pestilence was personified, and that the &quot;evil angels&quot; mentioned in Ps. lxxviii. 49 are to be regarded as personifications of this kind. &quot;Evil&quot; is here to be taken in the causative sense, as &quot;producing evil&quot;; for, as stated above, angels are generally considered to be by nature beneficent to man. They glorify God, whence the term &quot;glorifying angels&quot; comes (Ps. xxix. 1, ciii. 20, cxlviii. 2; compare Isa. vi. 2 et seq.).

They constitute God's court, sitting in council with Him (I Kings, xxii. 19; Job, i. 6, ii. 1); hence they are called His &quot;council of the holy ones&quot; (Ps. lxxxix. 7, R. V.; A. V. &quot;assembly of the saints&quot;). They accompany God as His attendants, when He appears to man (Deut. xxxiii. 2; Job, xxxviii. 7). This conception was developed after the Exile; and in the [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]], angels of various shapes are delegated &quot;to walk to and fro through the earth&quot; in order to find out and report what happens (Zech. vi. 7).

In the prophetic books, angels appear as representatives of the prophetic spirit, and bring to the prophets God's word. Thus the prophet [[Haggai]] was called God's messenger (angel); and it is known that &quot;Malachi&quot; is not a real name, but means &quot;messenger&quot; or &quot;angel&quot;. In I Kings, xiii. 18, an angel brought the divine word to the prophet.

In some places, it is implied that angels existed before the Creation (Gen. i. 26; Job, xxxviii. 7). The earlier Biblical writings did not speculate about them; simply regarding them, in their relations to man, as God's agents. Consequently, they did not individualize or denominate them; and in Judges, xiii. 18, and Gen. xxxii. 30, the angels, when questioned, refuse to give their names. In Daniel, however, there occur the names Michael and Gabriel. Michael is [[Israel]]'s representative in Heaven, where other nations—the [[Iran|Persia]]ns, for instance—were also represented by angelic princes. More than three hundred years before the Book of Daniel was written, Zechariah graded the angels according to their rank, but did not name them. The notion of the seven eyes (Zech. iii. 9, iv. 10) may have been affected by the representation of the seven archangels and also possibly by the  seven ''amesha spentas'' of Zoroastrianism (compare Ezek. ix. 2).

== Jewish views ==
Angels appear in several [[Tanakh|Old Testament]] (Hebrew Bible) stories, in addition to the ones previously mentioned above.  These include the warning to [[Lot (biblical)|Lot]] of the imminent destruction of [[Sodom]]. Many Bible chapters mention an &quot;angry God&quot; who sends His angel to smite the enemies of the Israelites. Traditional Jewish biblical commentators have a variety of ways of explaining what an angel is.  The earliest Biblical books present angels as heavenly beings created by God, some of whom apparently are endowed with free will. Later biblical books in the Tanakh present a stunningly different view of angels, as the Jewish beliefs about such things developed over the many years covered in the Bible.  Such a differing perspective on angels is discovered in the [[Book of Ezekiel]], where these angels bear no relation whatsoever to the former understanding of what an angel was.

The [[archangel (beings)|archangel]]s named in post-exile Judaism are [[Gabriel]], [[Michael]], [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], [[Uriel (archangel)|Uriel]], [[Raguel (archangel)|Raguel]], [[Sariel (archangel)|Sariel]], and [[Jerahmeel (archangel)|Jerahmeel]]. Gabriel and Michael are mentioned in the book of [[Daniel]], Raphael in the [[book of Tobit]] (from the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Apocrypha]] or [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanon]]) and the remaining four in the [[book of Enoch]] from the [[Old Testament]] [[Pseudepigrapha]] (considered canonical by the [[Ethiopian Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]]).

===Maimonides and rationalism===
In the [[Middle Ages]], some Jews developed a [[rationalism|rationalist]] view of angels that is still accepted by many Jews today. The rationalist view of angels, as held by [[Maimonides]], [[Gersonides]], [[Samuel Ibn Tibbon]], etc., states that God's actions are never mediated by a violation of the laws of nature. Rather, all such interactions are by way of angels. Even this can be highly misleading: Maimonides harshly states that the average person's understanding of the term &quot;angel&quot; is ignorant in the extreme. Instead, he says, the wise man sees that what the [[Bible]] and [[Talmud]] refer to as &quot;angels&quot; are actually metaphors for the various laws of nature, or the principles by which the physical universe operates, or kinds of platonic eternal forms. This is explained in his ''Guide of the Perplexed'' II:4 and II:6.
&lt;small&gt;

:II:4

:: ''&quot;...This leads [[Aristotle]] in turn to the demonstrated fact that God, glory and majesty to Him, does not do things by direct contact. God burns things by means of fire; fire is moved by the motion of the sphere; the sphere is moved by means of a disembodied intellect, these intellects being the 'angels which are near to Him', through whose mediation the spheres [planets] move....thus totally disembodied minds exist which emanate from God and are the intermediaries between God and all the bodies [objects] here in this world.&quot;''

:II:6

:: ''&quot;...Aristotle's doctrine that these disembodied spheres serve as the nexus between God and existence, by whose mediation the sphere are brought into motion, which is the cause of all becoming, is the express import of all the Scriptures. For you will never in Scripture any activity done by God except through an angel. And &quot;angel&quot;, as you know, means messenger. Thus anything which executes a command is an angel. So the motions of living beings, even those that are inarticulate, are said explicitly by [[Scripture]] to be due to angels.''

::''...Our argument here is concerned solely with those &quot;angels&quot; which are disembodied intellects. For our Bible is not unaware that God governs this existence through the mediation of angels...(Maimonides then quotes discussions of angels from [[Genesis]], [[Plato]], and [[Midrash]] Bereshit Rabbah)...the import in all these texts is not—as a primitive mentality would suppose—to suggest any discussion or planning or seeking of advice on God's part. How could the Creator receive aid from the object of his creation? The real import of all is to proclaim that existence—including particular individuals and even the formation of the parts of animals such as they are—is brought about entirely through the mediation of angels.''

::''For all forces are angels! How blind, how perniciously blind are the naïve?! If you told someone who purports to be a sage of Israel that the Deity sends an angel who enters a woman's womb and there forms an embryo, he would think this a miracle and accept it as a mark of the majesty and power of the Deity—despite the fact that he believes an angel to be a body of fire one third the size of the entire world. All this, he thinks, is possible for God. But if you tell him that God placed in the sperm the power of forming and demarcating these organs, and that this is the angel, or that all forms are produced by the Active Intellect—that here is the angel, the &quot;vice-regent of the world&quot; constantly mentioned by the sages—then he will recoil. For he [the naïve person] does not understand that the true majesty and power are in the bringing into being of forces which are active in a thing although they cannot be perceived by the senses.''

::''The sages of blessed memory state clearly—to those who are wise themselves—that every bodily power (not to mention forces at large in the world) is an angel and that a given power has one effect and no more. It says in Midrash Bereshit Rabbah &quot;We are given to understand that no angel performs two missions, nor do two angels perform one mission.&quot;—which is just the case with all forces. To confirm the conclusion that individual physical and psychological forces are called &quot;angels&quot;, there is the dictum of the sages, in a number of places, ultimately derived from Bereshit Rabbah, &quot;Each day the Holy One creates a band of angels who sing their song before him and go their way.&quot; Midrash Bereshit Rabbah, LXXVIII. When this midrash was countered with another which suggests that angels are permanent...the answer given was that some are permanent and other perish. And this is in fact the case. Particular forces come to be and pass away in constant succession; the species of such forces, however, are stable and enduring....[Giving a few more examples of the mention of angels in rabbinic writings, Maimonides says] Thus the Sages reveal to the aware that the imaginative faculty is also called an angel; and the mind is called a cherub. How beautiful this will appear to the sophisticated mind—and how disturbing to the primitive.&quot;''

&lt;/small&gt;

One can perhaps say that Maimonides thus presents a virtual rejection of the &quot;classical&quot; Jewish view of [[miracle]]s; he and others substitute a rationalism that seems more appropriate for 20th and 21st century religious rationalists.

Others might perhaps view Maimonides's statements as being perfectly in keeping with the continued evolvement of [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish thought]] over a period of several [[Millennium|millennia]].

== Christian views ==
[[Image:Jacob-angel.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|[[Jacob Wrestling with the Angel]] - [[Gustave Doré]], [[1855|(1855)]]]]

In the [[New Testament]] angels appear frequently as the ministers of God and the agents of revelation (''E.g.'' [[Matthew]] 1:20 (to Joseph), 4:11. (to Jesus), [[Luke]] 1:26 (to Mary), [[Acts]] 12:7 (to Peter)); and Jesus speaks of angels as fulfilling such functions (''E.g.'' [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 8:38, 13:27), implying in one saying that they neither marry nor are given in marriage (Mark 12:25). Naturally angels are most prominent in the Apocalypse. The New Testament takes little interest in the idea of the angelic hierarchy, but there are traces of the doctrine. The distinction of good and bad angels is recognized; [[Gabriel]] (Luke 1:19), [[Metatron]] (Rev. 10:1), and [[Michael]] (Daniel 12:1), and the evil angels [[Beelzebub]], (Mark 3:22) [[Satan]] (Mark 1:13), and[[Apollyon]] (Rev. 9:11); ranks are implied, archangels (Michael, Jude 9), principalities and powers (Rom. 8:38; Col. 2:10), thrones and dominions (Col 1:16). Angels occur in groups of four or seven (Rev 7:1). In Rev. 1-3. we meet with the Angels of the Seven Churches of Asia Minor. These are probably guardian angels, standing to the churches in the same relation that the angel-princes in Daniel stand to the nations; practically the angels are personifications of the churches.

The archangel Gabriel appeared to [[The Virgin Mary|Mary]] in the traditional role of messenger to inform her that her child would be the [[Messiah]], and other angels were present to herald his birth. In Matt. 28:2, an angel appeared at [[Jesus]]' tomb, frightened the Roman guards, rolled away the stone from the tomb, and later told the [[myrrh]]-bearing women of Jesus' [[resurrection]]. Alternately, in Mark 16:5 the angel is not seen until the women enter the already-opened tomb, and he is described simply as &quot;a young man.&quot; In Luke's version of the resurrection tale (Luke 24:4), two angels suddenly apparate next to the women within the tomb; they are described as being clothed in &quot;shining apparel.&quot; This is most similar to the version in John 20:12, where Mary alone speaks to &quot;two angels in white&quot; within the tomb of Jesus.

Two angels witnessed Jesus' ascent into [[Heaven]] and prophesied his return. When [[Saint Peter|Peter]] was imprisoned, an angel put his guards to sleep, released him from his chains, and led him out of the prison. Angels fill a number of different roles in the Book of Revelation. Among other things, they are seen gathered around the Throne of the Triple-God singing the thrice-holy [[hymn]].

Angels are frequently depicted as human in appearance, though many [[theology|theologian]]s have argued that they have no physical existence, but can incarnate.[[Seraphim]] are often depicted as six wings radiating from a center concealing a body, as depicted in the Bible. Starting with the end of the [[4th century]], angels were depicted with wings, presumably to give an easy explanation for them travelling to and from heaven. This is also heavily implied by the Scriptures. Scholastic theologians teach that angels are able to reason instantly, and to move instantly. They also teach that angels are intermediaries to some forces that would otherwise be natural forces of the universe, such as the rotation of planets and the motion of stars. Angels possess the beatific vision, or the unencumbered understanding of God (the essence of the pleasure of heaven). Furthermore, there are more angels than there are anything else in the universe (although when first written this would have probably not included atoms since atomic structure was not known). 

Religious thought about the angels during the middle ages was much influenced by the theory of the angelic hierarchy set forth in ''[[The Celestial Hierarchy]]'', a work of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], an unknown [[5th century]] [[author]] or authors writing in the style of [[Dionysius the Areopagite]]. The creeds and confessions do not formulate any authoritative doctrine of angels; and agnostics have tended to deny the existence of such beings, or to regard the subject as one on which we can have no certain knowledge. The principle of continuity, however, seems to require the existence of beings intermediate between man and God.

Some [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions hold that angels are organized into three major [[Hierarchy of angels|hierarchies]] which are subdivided into orders called Choirs, and list as many as ten orders of angels. ''The Celestial Hierarchy'' is the source of the names that have become part of tradition:  ''Angels'', ''Archangels'', ''Principalities'', ''Powers'', ''Virtues'', ''Dominions'', ''Thrones'', ''Cherubim'', and ''Seraphim''. In this hierarchy, the Cherubim and Seraphim are typically closest to God, while the Angels and Archangels are most active in human affairs. Many of these names come from verses in the Bible which would appear at first to be referencing a literal thing, although retroactively suggesting that they really mention angels can also make sense in the context. For example the verse in Paul &quot;our struggle is not with earthly things but with principalities and powers&quot; (meaning according to most theologians the [[fallen angel]]s of those choirs, used as an example of all the fallen angels).

Some Christian traditions also hold that angels play a variety of specific roles in the lives of believers. For instance, each Christian may be assigned a guardian angel at their baptism (although never defined by the Anglican, Catholic, or Orthodox churches, nevertheless it is personally held by many church members and most theologians). Each consecrated altar has at least one angel always present offering up prayers, and a number of angels join the congregation when they meet to pray. In the story of the 40 martyrs of Sebaste, in which 40 Christian Roman soldiers were made to stand [[nudity|naked]] on a frozen lake in the snow until they renounced their faith, angels were seen descending from Heaven placing the crowns of martyrs on their heads.

Certain Christian traditions, especially the [[Reformed]] tradition within [[Protestantism]] and the Anglican Church hold that references to the &quot;Angel of the Lord&quot; are references to pre-[[Incarnation]] appearances of Jesus. 

Some medieval Christian philosophers were influenced by the views of Maimonides, and accepted his view of angels. Today, these views of angels are still technically acceptable within many mainstream Christian denominations.

Satan, Beelzebul, and the rest of the demons are thought by Christians to be angels who rebelled against God and were expelled from Heaven. Christianity also considers other religions' gods as rebellious celestial spirits who oppose the Triple-God, the Trinity.

In many informal [[folklore|folk beliefs]] among Christians concerning the [[afterlife]], the souls of the virtuous dead ascend into Heaven to be converted into angel-like beings.  The [[Bible]] does state that at the resurrection, people will be like the angels with regard to marriage and immortality (Luke 20:35-36), and teaches such a transformation for instance at 1Cor 15:51; it states that the saints will judge angels (1 Cor 6:3). Flavius Josephus (Discourse to the Greeks concerning Hades, VI) teaches of ressurected men and woman, i.e. male and female. (Zechariah 5,9) could be interpreted, that there are also female angels. The statement of 1Cor 11:10 could be interpreted, as if male angels could be vulnerable to the female attractiveness by raping woman-- which would produce a giant (Gen. 6) or bring about the end of the world by conceiving the Antichrist. Official doctrines of most Christian churches teach that the virtuous are resurrected in the [[End times|end of times]], having a physical body again, unlike angels (see [[Swedenborgianism]] for a church that does officially and systematically teach that people enter heaven immediately after death).

==Islamic views==
:''Main article: [[Angels in Islam]]''
The belief in angels is central to the religion of [[Islam]], beginning with the belief that the [[Qur'an]] was dictated to the Prophet [[Muhammad]] by the chief of all angels, the archangel [[Jibril]] (Gabriel).  Angels are thus the ministers of God, as well as the agents of revelation in Islam.

In Islam, angels are benevolent beings created from light and do not possess free will. They are completely devoted to the worship of God ([[Allah]]) and carry out certain functions on His command, such as recording every human being's actions, placing a soul in a newborn child, maintaining certain environmental conditions of the planet (such as nurturing vegetation and distributing the rain) and taking the soul at the time of death. Angels are described as being excessively beautiful and have different numbers of wings (for example, Gabriel is attributed as having six-hundred wings in his natural form). They can take on human form, but only in appearance. As such, angels do not eat, procreate or commit sin as humans do.

According to the majority of [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]], angels are incapable of commiting sin, and therefore cannot fall from grace, excluding [[Iblis]] who chose to do evil because he had free-will and is not considered as a fallen angel, but a separate entity made of fire called [[jinn]]. Scholars cite the following Quranic [[ayat]] (verse), &quot;And when We said to the Angels; &quot;Prostrate yourselves unto Adam.&quot; So they prostrated themselves except Iblis. He was one of the jinn...&quot; ([[Sura]]t [[Al-Kahf]], 18:50). Angels, unlike the fiery nature of jinn, are beings of goodness and cannot choose to disobey God, nor do they possess the ability to do evil.

The archangel Jibril is attributed with sending the message of Allah to all the [[Prophets of Islam|Prophet]]s (including the [[Psalms]], [[Torah]], [[Bible]] and [[Qur'an]]. Other angels include Michael (Mikaeel) who discharges control of vegetation and rain, Sarafiel (Israfil) who will blow the trumpet on [[Qiyamah|Yaum al Qiyamah]] (the day of resurrection), and Azrael (Izra'il), the angel of death. The angels [[Nakir and Munkar]] are assigned to interrogate the dead before judgement day; and there are nineteen angels over-seeing the punishments of hell unflinchingly (Surat [[Al-Muddaththir]], 74:30). There are eight massive angels that support the Throne of God (Surat [[Al-Haaqqa]], 69:17). Every human being is assigned two angels to scribe a record of all actions done by the individual throughout their life, which will be used in evidence for or against the person by Allah on the day of judgement.

Humans do not turn into angels upon death, rather they are physically ressurected in body and soul and judged by God on judgement day (and that should they end up in [[Jannah]] (heaven), they are given perfect bodies).

==Latter-Day Saint views==
[[Image:Engel Moroni Bern Tempel.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Bern Switzerland Temple Statue of Angel Moroni]]
[[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] ([[Mormonism]]), and several of his associates, claimed that they were visited by angels on multiple occasions and for a variety of purposes in conjunction with the restoration of the gospel of Jesus.

According to the official doctrine of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]], (Bible Dictionary entry on &quot;Angels&quot;):

&lt;small&gt;
:: ''&quot;These are the messengers of the Lord, and are spoken of in the epistle to the Hebrews as 'ministering spirits'. We learn from latter-day revelation that there are two classes of heavenly beings who minister for the Lord: those who are spirits and those who have bodies of flesh and bone. Spirits are those beings who either have not yet obtained a body of flesh and bone (unembodied), or who have once had a mortal body and have died, and are awaiting the resurrection (disembodied). Ordinarily the word 'angel' means those ministering persons who have a body of flesh and bone, being either resurrected from the dead (reembodied), or else translated, as were Enoch, Elijah, etc. (D&amp;C 129).''&quot;
&lt;/small&gt;

[[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] described his first angelic encounter thus (Joseph Smith History 1:31-33):

&lt;small&gt;
:: ''&quot;While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.''

:: ''&quot;He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and neck were also bare. I could discover that he had no other clothing on but this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his bosom.''

:: ''&quot;Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked upon him, I was afraid; but the fear soon left me.&quot;''
&lt;/small&gt;

People who claimed to have received a visit by an angel include [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], [[Oliver Cowdery]], [[David Whitmer]], [[Martin Harris]]. Although Cowdery, Whitmer, and Harris all eventually became disaffected with Smith and left the church, none of them retracted their statement that they had seen and conversed with an angel of the Lord, and indeed, even defended their claim of angelic visitation to their deaths.

Names of some known angels who appeared are [[Moroni (Mormonism)|Moroni]], [[Nephi]], Peter, [[Saint James|James]], [[John the Apostle|John]], [[John the Baptist]].

Michael the archangel was [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] (the first man) when he was mortal, and Gabriel lived on the earth as [[Noah]] (the one who built the ark).

== Other religions ==
Angels are also a part of [[New Age]] beliefs. In [[Zoroastrianism]], the [[Amesha Spentas]] have often been regarded as angels, but this is not strictly correct since they don´t convey messages, but are rather emanations of [[Ahura Mazda]] (&quot;Wise Lord&quot;, God); they appear in an abstract fashion in the religious thought of [[Zarathustra]] and then later (during the [[Achaemenid]] period of Zoroastrianism) became personalized, associated with an aspect of the divine creation (fire, plants, water...). 

Also, angel-like beings called [[Tennin]] and [[Tenshi]] appear in [[Japanese mythology]]

===Hinduism===
In English, the Sanskrit word [[Deva (deity)|Deva]] is exclusively translated as &quot;god&quot;, which certainly gives a polytheistic appearance to Hinduism. Many Hindus now say that this is a poor practice, because the best word for God in Sanskrit is [[Ishvara]] (the Supreme Lord). The Devas may be better translated as angels or demigods. They are celestial beings with supernatural powers, but also weaknesses. They grant material benefits to humans upon praying and sacrificing to them, though they don't carry the message of Ishvara to the humans as in Abrahamic religions (a category of such beings also exist, called &quot;devaduta&quot; or &quot;duta&quot;). Buddhism and Jainism also believe in the existance of such devas. Examples of such devas are [[Indra]], [[Mitra]], [[Ashvins]], [[Varuna]], etc. Note that if a particular deva has a widespread cult, like [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]], he is believed not to be an ordinary deva but equated to Ishvara by his followers.

===Thelema===
[[Aleister Crowley]] tried to teach people to attain what he called &quot;the Knowledge and Conversation of the [[Holy Guardian Angel]]&quot;. Within the system of [[Thelema]], the Holy Guardian Angel is representative of one’s truest divine nature. Citing Crowley, people have linked the term with the Genius of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]], the [[Augoeides]] of [[Iamblichus (philosopher)|Iamblichus]], the [[Atman]] of [[Hinduism]], and the [[Daemon (mythology)|Daemon]] of the [[gnostic]]s.

According to most Thelemites, the single most important goal is to consciously connect with one’s HGA, a process termed &quot;Knowledge and Conversation.&quot; By doing so, the magician becomes fully aware of his own [[True Will]]. For Crowley, this event was the single most important goal of any adept:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It should never be forgotten for a single moment that the central and essential work of the Magician is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Once he has achieved this he must of course be left entirely in the hands of that Angel, who can be invariably and inevitably [be] relied upon to lead him to the further great step—crossing of the Abyss and the attainment of the grade of Master of the Temple. (''Magick Without Tears'', Ch.83) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crowley felt that attaining Knowledge and Conversation was so important, that he staked the claim that any other magical operation was, in a sense, evil.

==Angels as a development step of the soul==
Some [[mystics]] believe, that a [[soul]] is growing in steps from minerals, plants and animals to men. When the human body dies, a soul could become an angel. The Persian [[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic poet [[Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi]] wrote in his poem [[Masnavi]]:

The Christian mystic [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] has a similar imagination. In his late work ''Conjugal Love'' he describes, that a soul of a man and a soul of a woman are united by the marriage in heaven to become an angel.

The '''Allied Control Council''' or '''Allied Control Authority''', known in [[German language|German]] as the ''Alliierter Kontrollrat'', was a military occupation governing body of [[History of Germany|Germany]] after [[the end of World War II in Europe]]; the members were the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Soviet Union]]. [[France]] was later added with a vote but had no duties. The Allied Control Council was based in [[Schöneberg|Berlin-Schöneberg]].

== Creation ==

After the death of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Karl Dönitz]] became [[Reichspräsident|president of Germany]] in accordance with [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's last political testament]]. He authorised the signing, at [[Rheims]], of the unconditional surrender of all German forces, which took effect on [[8 May]] [[1945]], and tried to establish a government under [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Ludwig Graf Schwerin von Krosigk|von Krosigk]]. This government was not recognised by the Allies, however, and Dönitz and the other members were arrested on [[23 May]] by British forces.

The surrender document used by [[SHAEF]] at Rheims, was modelled on the one used a few days earlier to allow the German forces in Italy to surrender{{ref|page_256}}. They did not use the one which had been drafted for the surrender of Germany by the &quot;[[European Advisory Commission]]&quot; (EAC). This created a legal problem for the Allies, because although the German armed forces had surrendered unconditionally, the ''civilian'' German government had not been included in the surrender. This was considered a very important issue, given that Hitler had used the surrender of the civilian government, but ''not'' of the military, in [[1918]], to create the &quot;stab in the back&quot; argument{{ref|page_109}}. The Allies understandably did not want to give any future hostile German regime any kind of legal argument to resurrect an old quarrel. Eventually they decided not to recognise Dönitz, but to sign a four power document instead, creating the Allied Control Council. On [[5 July]] [[1945]], in [[Berlin]], the supreme commanders of the four occupying powers signed a common [[Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany]] (the so-called Berlin Declaration), which formally abolished any German governance over the nation:
:''The Governments of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom, and the Provisional Government of the French Republic, hereby assume supreme authority with respect to Germany, including all the powers possessed by the German Government, the High Command and any state, municipal, or local government or authority. The assumption, for the purposes stated above, of the said authority and powers does not affect the annexation of Germany.'' [US Department of State, Treaties and Other International Acts Series, No. 1520.]
In reality, of course, all German central civilian authority had ceased to exist with the death of Hitler and the fall of Berlin at the latest. These parts of the Berlin declaration, therefore, merely formalised the ''[[de facto]]'' status and placed the Allied military rule over Germany on a solid legal basis.

The actual exertion of power was carried out according to the model first laid out in the &quot;Agreement on Control Machinery in Germany&quot; that had been signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union on [[25 November]] [[1944]] in [[London]] based on the work of the [[European Advisory Commission]]. Germany was divided into three zones of occupation, an American, a British, and a Soviet one, and each zone was ruled by the Commander-in-Chief of the respective occupational forces. (Later a French zone was added.) &quot;Matters that affect Germany as a whole,&quot; however, would have to be decided jointly by all three Commanders-in-Chief, who for this purpose would form a single organ of control. This authority was called the Control Council.

The purpose of the Allied Control Council was to deal with the German central administration, an idea that hardly materialised as that administration totally broke down with the end of the war, and to assure that the military administration was carried out with a certain uniformity throughout all of Germany. The [[Potsdam Agreement]] of [[2 August]] [[1945]] further specified the tasks of the Control Council.

== Operation ==

On [[30 August]] [[1945]] the Control Council constituted itself and issued its first proclamation, which informed the German people of the Council's existence and asserted that the commands and directives issued by the Commanders-in-Chief in their respective zones were not affected by the establishment of the Council. The initial members of the Control Council were as follows: Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] for the Soviet Union, Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] for the United Kingdom, General [[Dwight Eisenhower]] for the United States, and General [[Jean Joseph-Marie Gabriel Lattre de Tassigny]] for France.

In the following time, the Allied Control Council issued a substantial number of laws, directives, orders, and proclamations. They dealt with the abolishment of [[Nazi]] laws and organisations, [[demilitarisation]], [[denazification]], but also with such comparatively pedestrian matters as telephone tariffs or the combat of venereal diseases. However, relations between the Western Allies (especially the United States and the United Kingdom) and the Soviet Union quickly deteriorated, and so did their cooperation in the administration of occupied Germany. Against Soviet protests, the two Anglo-Saxon powers pushed for a heightened economic collaboration between the different zones, and on [[1 January]] [[1947]] the British and American zones merged to form the [[Bizone]]. Over the course of 1947 and early [[1948]], they began to prepare the currency reform that would introduce the [[Deutsche Mark]], and ultimately the creation of an independent West German state. When the Soviets learnt about this, they claimed that such plans were in violation of the Potsdam Agreement, that obviously the Western powers were not interested in further regular four-power control of Germany, and that under such circumstances the Control Council had no purpose anymore. On [[20 March]] [[1948]], Marshal Sokolovsky, the Soviet representative, walked out of the meeting of the Council, never to attend one again.

==After the breakdown==
As the Control Council could only act with the agreement of all four members, this move basically shut down the institution, while the [[Cold War]] reached an early high point during the [[Berlin Blockade|Soviet blockade of Berlin]]. The Allied Control Council was not formally dissolved, but ceased all activity except the operations of the [[Four-Power Authorities]], namely the mangement  of the [[Spandau Prison]] where persons convicted at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] were held until [[1987]], and the [[Berlin Air Safety Center]]

The Western powers instituted the [[Allied High Commission]] by September of 1949 which remained in operation until 1955. In Eastern Germany, the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet administration]] with its representative of the ACC was the highest authority, later this position was converted to a High Commissioner as well, until the [[German Democratic Republic]] gained sovereignty. 

Germany remained under nominal military occupation until [[12 September]] [[1990]], when the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]], the final [[peace treaty]], was signed by the four powers and the two German governments, restoring German sovereignty. This meant the official end of the Allied Control Council, insofar as it still existed at all.

== The building ==

During its short active life, the Allied Control Council was housed in and operated from the former building of the [[Kammergericht]], the supreme court of the state of [[Prussia]], which is situated in Berlin's [[Schöneberg]] borough in the American sector. The building itself had suffered some battle damage, losing a central tower, but had remained mostly usable. After the cessation of most Council activity in 1948, all occupying powers quickly withdrew from the building to their respective sectors of the city, leaving the facility cold, empty and dark.

Only one [[four-power organization|four-power organisation]], the [[Berlin Air Safety Center]] (BASC), remained in the building from 1945 until the fall of the wall in [[1989]].  As a symbol of the BASC's continued presence, the four national flags of the occupying powers still flew over the large front doors every day. The only other signs of occupancy were the few, sparse office lights that emanated from a small corner room of the building &amp;mdash; the BASC Operations Room &amp;mdash; in the evenings.  Of the 550 rooms in the building, the BASC office complex and guards' quarters occupied fewer than forty. 

Because of the BASC's presence, the building remained closely guarded by United States [[Embassy]] guards, with access granted only to select members of the four powers.  This led to mysterious legends and ghost stories about the eerie, dark facility with its grand, granite statuary overlooking the beautiful park.   

After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], and after the Soviet troops left Berlin in [[1994]], the building was returned to the German government. In [[1997]], its erstwhile occupant, the [[Kammergericht]], moved in. It now functions as the supreme court of the state of [[Berlin]].
