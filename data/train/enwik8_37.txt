'''Alkaline [[earth (chemistry)|earth]]''' contains or consits of an [[oxides]] of [[alkaline earth metals]], such as lime, magnesia, strontia, and baryta. The alkaline earth metals are among the most electropositive of all metals, second only to the Group 1 or Alkali metals. Consequently, most of their compounds have a high degree of ionic character. This confers a high degree of basic nature to the oxides. On reacting with water, the corresponding hydroxides are obtained (in solution) which are strong bases. Although highly corrosive, they are used as antacids for their strongly basic nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Otherusesabout|an incantational word}}
'''''Abracadabra''''' is a word used as an [[incantation]], considered by some to be the phrase that is pronounced most universally in other languages without translation.

The word is now commonly used as an [[incantation]] by [[stage magic|stage magicians]]. In ancient times, however, it was taken much more seriously as an incantation to be used as a cure against fevers and inflammations. The first known mention was in ''De Medicina Praecepta'' by [[Serenus Sammonicus]], [[physician]] to the [[Roman emperor]] [[Caracalla]], who prescribed that the sufferer from the disease wear an [[amulet]] containing the word written in the form of an inverted cone:

&lt;center&gt;
A B R A C A D A B R A&lt;br /&gt;
A B R A C A D A B R&lt;br /&gt;
A B R A C A D A B&lt;br /&gt;
A B R A C A D A&lt;br /&gt;
A B R A C A D&lt;br /&gt;
A B R A C A&lt;br /&gt;
A B R A C&lt;br /&gt;
A B R A&lt;br /&gt;
A B R&lt;br /&gt;
A B&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;/center&gt;

This, he explained, diminishes the hold of the spirit of the disease over the patient. Other [[Roman emperor]]s, including [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] and [[Alexander Severus]], were followers of the medical teachings of Serenus Sammonicus and are likely to have used the incantation as well. 

==Etymology==
Theories about the source of the word are:-

===''&quot;I create as I speak&quot;''===
A possible source is [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]: אברא כדברא ''avra kehdabra'' which means &quot;I will create as I speak&quot;.

===The curse and the pestilence===
There is the view that Abracadabra derives from the Hebrew, ''ha-brachah'', meaning &quot;the blessing&quot; (used in this sense as a euphemism for &quot;the curse&quot;) and ''dabra'', an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] form of the Hebrew word ''dever'', meaning &quot;pestilence.&quot; They point to a similar kabbalistic cure for blindness, in which the name of [[Shabriri]], the [[demon]] of blindness, is similarly diminished. Other scholars are skeptical of this origin and claim that the idea of diminishing the power of demons was common throughout the ancient world, and that Abracadabra was simply the name of one such demon.

===Father, Son, Holy Spirit===
Some point to the Hebrew words  ''av'' (&quot;father&quot;),  ''ben'' (&quot;son&quot;), and ''ruakh hakodesh'' (&quot;the holy spirit&quot;).

===Disappear like this word===
Some have argued that the term may come from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''abhadda kedhabhra'', meaning 'disappear like this word'. Rather than being used as a curse, the Aramaic phrase is believed to have been used as a means of treating illness.

===Abraxas===
It has also been claimed that the word comes from [[Abraxas]], a [[Gnostic]] word for God (the source of [[365]] emanations, apparently the Greek letters for Abraxas add up to 365 when deciphered according to [[numerology|numerological methods]]). It has also been claimed to come from Abracalan (or Aracalan), said to have been both a [[Syria]]n god and a Jewish magical symbol.

==Thelema==
The religion of [[Thelema]] spells the word &quot;Abrahadabra&quot;, and considers it the magical formula of the current Aeon. The religion's founder, [[Aleister Crowley]], explains in his essay &lt;i&gt;Gematria&lt;/i&gt; that he discovered the word (and his spelling) by [[cabala|cabalistic]] methods. He appears to say that this happened before his January 1901 meeting with [[Oscar Eckenstein]], one of his teachers. (At this meeting, Eckenstein ordered him to abandon magick for the moment and practice meditation or concentration.) The Word Abrahadabra appears repeatedly in the 1904 invocation of [[Horus]] that led to the founding of [[Thelema]]. (&lt;i&gt;The Equinox&lt;/i&gt; I, no. 7. 1912) It also appears in a 1901 diary that Crowley published in &lt;i&gt;The Equinox&lt;/i&gt;.

The essay &lt;i&gt;Gematria&lt;/i&gt; gives Hindu, Christian, and &quot;Unsectarian&quot; versions of the problem that Crowley intended this magick word to answer. He also gives a [[cabala|qabalistic]] equivalent for each phrasing, and a brief symbolic answer for each. The unsectarian version reads, &quot;I am the finite square; I wish to be one with the infinite circle.&quot; Its equivalent refers to &quot;the Cross of Extension&quot; and &quot;the infinite Rose.&quot; Crowley's numerological explanation of ABRAHADABRA focuses mainly on this last formulation and the answer to it.

==Avada Kedavra in Harry Potter==
The &quot;Killing Curse&quot; in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' stories may have been taken by [[J. K. Rowling]] from an Aramaic form &quot;avada kedavra&quot; or similar, which roughly means &quot;what I speak is destroyed,&quot; influenced by the [[Latin]] word ''cadaver'', meaning &quot;corpse&quot;. This form differs from the &quot;I create as I speak&quot; form (&quot;Avara Kedavra&quot;) by a single letter in the English transliteration; it is one of the few spells in ''Harry Potter'' not derived from Latin.

The '''Acts of Union''' were twin Acts of Parliament passed in [[1707]] (taking effect on [[26 March]]) by the [[Parliament of England]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]].  The acts were the implementation of the Treaty of Union, negotiated between the two kingdoms.  The effect of the Acts was twofold:

* to create a new state: the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], although the name had been used on occasion since [[1603]] when speaking of the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] together, which had shared a monarch from that date but retained [[sovereignty | sovereign]] parliaments. [[Wales]] was also part of this Great Britain since it had been absorbed by England by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542]].
* to dissolve both parliaments and replace them with a new [[Parliament of Great Britain]] (this event is known as the '''Union of the Parliaments'''). The new parliament was to be based in the former home of the English Parliament.

[[Image:ActsOfUnion1707-Painting.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Walter Thomas Monnington's 1925 painting called ''Parliamentary Union of England and Scotland 1707'' hangs in the Palace of Westminster depicting the official presentation of the law that formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain.]]

While there had been three earlier attempts (in [[1606]], [[1667]] and [[1689]]) to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, these were the first Acts which had the will of both political establishments behind them, albeit for rather different reasons. In the English case, the purpose was to establish the Royal succession along [[Protestant]] lines in the same manner as provided for by the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]] rather than that of the Scottish [[Act of Security]].  The two countries had shared a king for much of the previous century.  The English were now concerned that an independent Scotland with a different king, even if he were a Protestant, might make alliances against England.

In the Scottish case, the purpose was partly to use English subsidies to recover from the financial problems caused by the failure of the [[Darién scheme]] and partly to remove English trade sanctions put in place through the [[Alien Act]] to force the Scottish Parliament into compliance with the Act of Settlement.

The treaty consisted of 25 articles, 15 of which were economic in character. In Scotland, each article was voted on separately and several clauses in articles were delegated to specialised subcommittees. Article 1 of the treaty was based on the political principle of an incorporating union and this was secured by a majority of 115 votes to 83 on [[4 November]], [[1706]]. In order to minimalise the opposition of the [[Church of Scotland]], an act was also passed in order to secure the Presbyterian establishment of the Church after which the Church stopped its open opposition, although hostility remained at lower levels of the clergy. The treaty as a whole was finally ratified on [[16 January]], [[1707]] by a majority of 110 votes to 67.

The ultimate securing of the treaty in the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish Parliament]] can be attributed more to the weakness and lack of cohesion between the various opposition groups in the House as opposed to the strength of pro-incorporationists. The combined votes of the Court party with a majority of the Squadrone Volante were sufficient to ensure the final passage of the treaty through the House. Many members had invested heavily in the Darién Scheme and they believed that they would receive compensation for their losses; Article 14, the Eqivalent granted [[£]]398 085 10[[Shilling|s]] to Scotland to offset future liability towards the English national debt. In essence, it was also used a means of compensation for investors in Darién.

Bribery and financial persuasion were also prevalent. £20 000 (£240 000 [[Pound Scots|Scots]]) being despatched to Scotland for distribution by the Earl of Glasgow. James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry, the Queen's Commissioner in Parliament received £12 325 sterling, the majority of the funding. The bulk of this funding was used in the payment of [[Espionage|spies]] and agent provocateurs. 

The Acts of Union were far from universally popular in Scotland, particularly amongst the general population.  Many petitions were sent to the Scottish Parliament against union, and there were massive protests in [[Edinburgh]] and several other Scottish towns on the day it as threat of widespread civil unrest resulted in the imposition of martial law by the Parliament. [[George Lockhart|Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath]], a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] and the only member of the Scottish negotiating team who was not pro-incorporation, noted that `The whole nation appears against the Union'. [[John Clerk of Penicuik|Sir John Clerk of Penicuik]], an ardent pro-unionist and Union negotiator, observed that the treaty was `contrary to the inclinations of at least three-fourths of the Kingdom'. [[Daniel Defoe]] first reports were of vivid descriptions of violent demonstrations against the Union. ''&quot;A Scots rabble is the worst of its kind,&quot;'' he later reported ''&quot;for every Scot in favour there is 99 against&quot;''. Public opinion against the Treaty as it passed through the Scottish Parliament was voiced through petitions from the Scottish localities. Anti-union petitions were received from shires, burghs, presbyteries and parishes. The Convention of Royal Burghs also petitioned against the Union and not one petition in favour of an incorporating union was received by Parliament. 

The twin Acts incorporated provisions for Scotland to send [[Peers and Parliament|representative peer]]s from the [[Peerage of Scotland]] to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. It guaranteed that the [[Church of Scotland]] would remain the established church in Scotland, that the [[Court of Session]] would &quot;remain in all time coming within Scotland&quot; and that [[Scots law]] would &quot;remain in the same force as before&quot;.

Other provisions included the restatement of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the ban on [[Roman Catholics]] from taking the throne. It also created a [[customs union]] and [[monetary union]]. Scotland kept its independence with respect to its legal (Article 19), religious and education systems.

The Act provided that any &quot;laws and statutes&quot; that were &quot;contrary to or inconsistent with the terms&quot; of the Act would &quot;cease and become void.&quot;

{{Royal Navy}}

The '''Admiralty''' was formerly the authority in the [[United Kingdom]] responsible for the command of the [[Royal Navy]]. Originally exercised by a single person, the office of '''Lord High Admiral''' was from the [[18th century]] invariably put &quot;in commission&quot;, and was exercised by a '''Board of Admiralty''', officially known as '''The Commissioners for Exercising the Office of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, &amp;c.''' (alternatively of '''[[Kingdom of England|England]]''', '''[[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]''' or the '''[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]''' depending on the period).

In [[1964]] the functions of the Admiralty were transferred to a new [[Admiralty Board]], which is a committee of the tri-service [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom]] and part of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. The new Admiralty Board meets only twice a year, and the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy is controlled by a [[Navy Board]] (not to be confused with the historical Navy Board described later in this article). It is now uncommon for the various authorities now in charge of the Royal Navy to be referred to simply as &quot;The Admiralty.&quot;

The title of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom is now vested in the [[British monarch|Sovereign]]. However, there continues to be a [[Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom]] and a [[Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom]], both of which are honorary offices.

For information on the administration of the Royal Admiralty, with specific information regarding each of the separate officers and branches see: [[Admiralty administration]].

==History==
[[Image:Admiralty_Flag.gif|thumb|right|Flag of the Lord High Admiral or the Admiralty]]
The office of ''Admiral of England'', or ''Lord Admiral'' and later ''Lord High Admiral'' was created in around [[1400]]. In [[1546]] King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] established the ''Council of the Marine'', later to became the ''Navy Board'', to oversee administrative affairs of the naval service. Operational control of the Navy remained the responsibility of the Lord High Admiral, who was one of the nine [[Great Officers of State]].

In [[1628]], [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] put the office of Lord High Admiral into commission and control of the Royal Navy passed to a committee in the form of the ''Board of the Admiralty''. The office of Lord High Admiral passed a number of times in and out of commission until [[1709]], after which the office was almost permanently in commission (the last Lord High Admiral being the future [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] in the early [[19th century]]). .

The members of the Board of Admiralty were known as the '''Lords Commissioners of Admiralty'''. The Lords Commissioners were always a mixture of [[admirals]], known as Naval Lords or Sea Lords, and civilian lords, normally politicians. The president of the Board was known as the '''First Lord of the Admiralty''', who was a member of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]].

After [[1806]], the First Lord of the Admiralty was always a civilian, while the professional head of the navy came to be (and is still today) known as the [[First Sea Lord]].

In [[1831]] the Navy Board was abolished as a separate entity and its duties and responsibilities were given over to the Board of Admiralty.

In [[1964]] the Admiralty was subsumed into the Ministry of Defence along with the [[War Office]] and the [[Air Ministry]]. Within the expanded Ministry of Defence are the new ''Admiralty Board'', ''Army Board'' and ''Air Force Board'', each headed by the [[Secretary of State for Defence]]. As mentioned above, there is also a Navy Board in charge of the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy.

==The buildings==
[[Image:The Admiralty (now the Ripley Buidling) by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd, 1830..jpg|thumb|250px|The Old Admiralty or Ripley Building.]]
[[Image:Admiralty 1794 Draughtsman; Chawner, Thomas.jpg|thumb|250px|The Admiralty in 1794. The different colours indicate different departments or residences for the several Lords of the Admiralty. The pale coloured extension behind the small courtyard on the left is Admiralty House.]]
The Admiralty complex lies between [[Whitehall]], [[Horse Guards Parade]] and [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] and includes five buildings. As the Admiralty no longer exists as a department, these are now used as an &quot;office bank&quot; by the government:
*The oldest building was long known simply as The Admiralty, and is now referred to popularly as the '''Old Admiralty''' and officially as the '''Ripley Building'''. It was designed and built by [[Thomas Ripley (architect)|Thomas Ripley]], a former carpenter and protegé of Sir [[Robert Walpole]], whose creation provoked the scorn of [[Alexander Pope]]:
:''See under Ripley rise a new [[Banqueting House at Whitehall|White-hall]]'',
:''While [[Inigo Jones|Jones']] and [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Boyle's]] united labours fall''.
:::&amp;mdash; ''The Dunciad'' (1743), book III, ii, 327-8

It is a three storey u-shaped brick building, and completed in 1726. As Pope implied the architecture is rather dull, lacking either the vigour of the [[baroque]] style which was fading from fashion at the time, or the austere grandeur of the [[Palladian]] style which was just coming into vogue. It is mainly notable for being perhaps the first purpose built office building in Great Britain. It contained a board room, other state rooms and offices and apartments for the Lords of the Admiralty. [[Robert Adam]] designed the screen which was added to the entrance front in 1788. Nowadays the Ripley Building is allocated to the [[Cabinet Office]] and contains government function rooms.

*'''[[Admiralty House (London)|Admiralty House]]''': This is a moderately proportioned mansion to the south of the Ripley Building, which was built in the late 18th century as the residence of the First Lord of the Admiralty, and served that purpose until 1964. [[Winston Churchill]] was one of its occupants. It lacks its own entrance from Whitehall, and is entered through the Ripley Building. It is a three storey building in yellow brick with [[neo-classical]] interiors. Its rear facade faces directly onto Horse Guards Parade. The architect was [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]]. There are now three ministerial flats in the building [http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03367.pdf].
[[Image:Old_admiralty.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Admiralty Extension dates from the turn of the 20th century]]
*The '''Admiralty Extension'''. This is the largest of the Admiralty Buildings. It was begun in the late 19th century and redesigned while the construction was in progress to accommodate the extra offices needed due to the naval arms race with the [[German Empire]]. It is red brick building with white stone detailing in the [[Queen Anne]] style with French influences.
*'''[[Admiralty Arch]]''' is linked to the Admiralty extension by a bridge. In architectural terms it is part of the ceremonial route from Trafalgar Square to [[Buckingham Palace]]. It contains further offices. 
*The '''Admiralty Citadel''' is a squat windowless [[World War II]] fortress at the north east corner of Horse Guards Parade. See [[Military citadels under London]] for further details.

The '''Advertising Standards Authority''' (ASA) is an independent [[United Kingdom|British]] regulatory body set up by the [[advertising]] industry to monitor advertisements in print and broadcast media. The central tenets of its [[Advertising Code]] are that adverts must be &quot;legal, decent, honest, and truthful&quot;.

As it is not a government body, it has no statutory authority. However, as its rulings are poor publicity for advertisers in breach of the Code, it is usually able to enforce correct observance in Britain. It can also refer some forms of breach - for instance, where breach persists despite warnings, consumer safety is an issue, or there is evidence of [[fraud]] - to the government [[Office of Fair Trading]], which does have legal powers to invoke [[consumer protection]] laws.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Amputee.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Partial hand amputation]]

'''Amputation''' is the removal of a body extremity by [[Physical trauma|trauma]] or [[surgery]]. As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as [[cancer|malignancy]] or [[gangrene]].  In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventative surgery for such problems.  In [[Islam|Islamic]] countries, amputation of the hands or feet is sometimes used as a form of [[punishment]] for criminals.

==Types==
[[Image:Three-legged-dog 7th day past amputation.jpg|thumb|right|100px|dog on seventh day past amputation]]
[[Image:Three-legged-dog_sheila_32nd_day2.jpg|thumb|right|100px|dog on 32nd day past amputation]]
[[Image:Three-legged-dog_sheila1.jpg|thumb|right|100px|dog three months past amputation]]
Types of amputation include:
* [[leg]]
** amputation of digits
** partial foot amputation (Chopart, Lisfranc)
** ankle disarticulation (Syme, Pyrogoff)
** below-knee amputation (transtibial)
** knee-bearing amputation (knee disarticulation)
** above knee amputation (transfemoral)
** Van-ness rotation (Foot being turned around and reattached to allow the ankle joint to be used as a knee.)
** hip disarticulation
** [[hemipelvectomy]]
* [[arm]]
** amputation of digits
** metacarpal amputation
** wrist disarticulation
** forearm amputation (transradial)
** elbow disarticulation
** above-elbow amputation (transhumeral)
** shoulder disarticulation and forequarter amputation

[[Hemicorporectomy]], or amputation at the waist, is the most radical amputation. 

[[Genital modification and mutilation]] may involve amputating tissue, although not necessarily as a result of injury or disease.

As a rule, partial amputations are preferred to preserve joint function, but in oncological surgery, disarticulation is favored.

==Method==
[[Image:Curvy amputation knife DSC09451.jpg|thumb|200px|Curved knives such as this one were used, in the past, for some kinds of amputations.]]
The first step is ligating the supplying [[artery]] and [[vein]], to prevent [[hemorrhage]]. The muscles are transsected, and finally the [[bone]] is sawed through with an oscillating saw. Skin and muscle flaps are then transposed over the [[stump]], occasionally with the insertion of elements to attach a [[prosthesis]].  In a disarticulation amputation, the bone is removed at the joint.

==Complications==
Some amputees experience the phenomenon of [[phantom limb]]s; they feel body parts that are no longer there. These limbs can itch, ache, and feel as if they are moving. Some scientists believe it has to do with a kind of neural map that the brain has of the body, which sends information to the rest of the brain about limbs regardless of their existence.

In many cases, the phantom limb aids in adaptation to a prosthesis, as it permits the person to experience [[proprioception]] of the prosthetic limb.

==Self-amputation==
In some rare cases when a person has become trapped (on account of getting a limb stuck) in a deserted place, with no means of communication or hope of rescue, the victim has amputated his own limb:
* In 2003, 27-year old [[Aron Ralston]] amputated his [[forearm]] using his [[pocketknife]] and breaking and tearing the two [[bone]]s, after the arm got stuck under a boulder when hiking in [[Utah]].
* Also in 2003, an Australian coal miner amputated his own arm with a [[Stanley knife]] after it became trapped when the [[front-end loader]] he was driving overturned three kilometers underground. [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/29/1056825279321.html]

The wire (4 conductors running inside a shield) runs along the rightmost leg of the 3 legged &quot;tripod&quot; mount that's attached to the rigging that runs around the perimeter of the roof.]]

An '''anemometer''' is a device for measuring the [[wind speed|velocity]] or the [[pressure]] of the [[wind]], and is one instrument used in a [[weather station]]. The term is derived from the Greek word &quot;anemos&quot; meaning wind.

Anemometers may be divided into two classes, (1) those that measure the [[velocity]], (2) those that measure the [[pressure]] of the wind, but inasmuch as there is a close connection between the pressure and the velocity, a suitable anemometer of either class will give information about both these quantities.

The First anemometer was invented by Leon Battista Alberti in the 1400's.

==Velocity anemometers==
Velocity anemometers may again be subdivided into two classes, (1) those which do not require a [[wind vane]] or [[weathercock]], (2) those which do. 

===Cup anemometers===
The familiar cup-anemometer, invented ([[1846]]) by Dr. [[John Thomas Romney Robinson]], of [[Armagh Observatory]], is the best-known and most generally used instrument, and belongs to the first of these. It consists of four hemispherical cups, mounted one on each end of a pair of horizontal arms, which lie at right angles to each other and form a cross. A vertical axis round which the cups turn passes through the centre of the cross; a train of wheel-work counts up the number of turns which this axis makes, and from the number of turns made in any given time the velocity of the wind during that time is calculated. The cups are placed symmetrically on the end of the arms, so it is easy to see that the wind always has the hollow of one cup presented to it; the back of the cup on the opposite end of the cross also faces the wind, but the pressure on it is naturally less, and hence a continual rotation is produced; each cup in turn as it comes round providing the necessary force. The two great merits of this anemometer are its simplicity and the absence of a wind vane; on the other hand it is not well adapted to leaving a record on paper of the actual velocity at any definite instant, and hence it leaves a short but violent gust unrecorded. Unfortunately, when Dr. Robinson first designed his anemometer, he stated that no matter what the size of the cups or the length of the arms, the cups always moved with one-third of the velocity of the wind. This result was apparently confirmed by some independent experiments, but it is very far from the truth, for it is now known that the actual ratio, or factor as it is commonly called, of the velocity of the wind to that of the cups depends very largely on the dimensions of the cups and arms, and may have almost any value between two and a little over three. The result has been that wind velocities published in many official publications have often been in error by nearly 50%.

=== Windmill anemometers ===
[[Image:Wind speed and direction instrument - NOAA.jpg|right|200px|thumb|An aerovane]]
The other forms of velocity anemometer may be described as belonging to the [[windmill]] type. In the Robinson anemometer the axis of rotation is vertical, but with this subdivision the axis of rotation must be parallel to the direction of the wind and therefore horizontal. Furthermore, since the wind varies in direction and the axis has to follow its changes, a [[weather vane|wind vane]] or some other contrivance to fulfill the same purpose must be employed. An [[aerovane]] combines a propeller and a tail on the same axis to obtain accurate and precise wind speed and direction measurements from the same instrument. In cases where the direction of the air motion is always the same, as in the ventilating shafts of mines and buildings for instance, wind vanes, known as air meters are employed, and give most satisfactory results.

==Pressure anemometers==
Anemometers which measure the pressure may be divided into the plate and tube classes, but the former term must be taken as including a good many miscellaneous forms. 

===Plate anemometers===
The simplest type of this form consists of a flat plate, which is usually square or circular, while a wind vane keeps this exposed normally to the wind, and the pressure of the wind on its face is balanced by a spring. The distortion of the spring determines the actual force which the wind is exerting on the plate, and this is either read off on a suitable gauge, or leaves a record in the ordinary way by means of a pen writing on a sheet of paper moved by clockwork. Instruments of this kind have been in use for a long series of years, and have recorded pressures up to and even exceeding 60 lbf/ft&amp;sup2; (2.9 kPa), but it is now fairly certain that these high values are erroneous, and due, not to the wind, but to faulty design of the anemometer.

The fact is that the wind is continually varying in force, and while the ordinary pressure plate is admirably adapted for measuring the force of a steady and uniform wind, it is entirely unsuitable for following the rapid fluctuations of the natural wind. To make matters worse, the pen which records the motion of the plate is often connected with it by an extensive system of chains and levers. A violent gust strikes the plate, which is driven back and carried by its own momentum far past the position in which a steady wind of the same force would place it; by the time the motion has reached the pen it has been greatly exaggerated by the springiness of the connection, and not only is the plate itself driven too far back, but also its position is wrongly recorded by the pen; the combined errors act the same way, and more than double the real maximum pressure may be indicated on the chart.

A modification of the ordinary pressure-plate has recently been designed. In this arrangement a catch is provided so that the plate being once driven back by the wind cannot return until released by hand; but the catch does not prevent the plate being driven back farther by a gust stronger than the last one that moved it. Examples of these plates are erected on the west coast of England, where in the winter fierce gales often occur; a pressure of 30 lbf/ft&amp;sup2; (1.5 kPa) has not been shown by them, and instances exceeding 20 lbf/ft&amp;sup2; (1 kPa) are extremely rare.

Many other modifications have been used and suggested. Probably a sphere would prove most useful for a pressure anemometer, since owing to its symmetrical shape it would not require a weathercock. A small light sphere hanging from the end of 30 or 40 ft (about 10 m) of fine sewing cotton has been employed to measure the wind velocity passing over a kite, the tension of the cotton being recorded, and this plan has given satisfactory results.

===Tube anemometers===

[[Image:Anemometers.png|thumb|Anemometers]]

Lind's anemometer, which consists simply of a U tube containing liquid with one end bent into a horizontal direction to face the wind, is perhaps the original form from which the tube class of instrument has sprung. If the wind blows into the mouth of a tube it causes an increase of pressure inside and also of course an equal increase in all closed vessels with which the mouth is in airtight communication. If it blows horizontally over the open end of a vertical tube it causes a decrease of pressure, but this fact is not of any practical use in anemometry, because the magnitude of the decrease depends on the wind striking the tube exactly at right angles to its axis, the most trifling departure from the true direction causing great variations in the magnitude. The pressure tube anemometer (fig. 1) utilizes the increased pressure in the open mouth of a straight tube facing the wind, and the decrease of pressure caused inside when the wind blows over a ring of small holes drilled through the metal of a vertical tube which is closed at the upper end. The pressure differences on which the action depends are very small, and special means are required to register them, but in the ordinary form of recording anemometer (fig. 2), any wind capable of turning the vane which keeps the mouth of the tube facing the wind is capable of registration.

The great advantage of the tube anemometer lies in the fact that the exposed part can be mounted on a high pole, and requires no oiling or attention for years; and the registering part can be placed in any convenient position, no matter how far from the external part. Two connecting tubes are required. It might appear at first sight as though one connection would serve, but the differences in pressure on which these instruments depend are so minute, that the pressure of the air in the room where the recording part is placed has to be considered. Thus if the instrument depends on the pressure or suction effect alone, and this pressure or suction is measured against the air pressure in an ordinary room, in which the doors and windows are carefully closed and a newspaper is then burnt up the chimney, an effect may be produced equal to a wind of 10 mi/h (16 km/h); and the opening of a window in rough weather, or the opening of a door, may entirely alter the registration.

==Notes on wind measurements==
The connection between the velocity and the pressure of the wind is one that is not yet known with absolute certainty. Many text-books on engineering give the relation &lt;math&gt; P = 0.005 v^2&lt;/math&gt; when ''P'' is the pressure in pounds force per square foot and ''v'' the velocity in miles per hour (equivalent to &lt;math&gt; P = 0.048 v^2&lt;/math&gt; for ''P'' in [[pascal]]s and ''v'' in m/s). The history of this untrue relation is curious. It was given about the end of the 18th century as based on some experiments, but with a footnote stating that little reliance could be placed on it. The statement without the qualifying note was copied from book to book, and at last received general acceptance. There is no doubt that under average conditions of atmospheric density, the 0.005 should be replaced by 0.003, for many independent authorities using different methods have found values very close to this last figure. It is probable that the wind pressure is not strictly proportional to the extent of the surface exposed. Pressure plates are generally of moderate size, from a half or quarter of a square foot up to two or three square feet (3 m&amp;sup2; to 32 m&amp;sup2;), are round or square, and for these sizes, and shapes, and of course for a flat surface, the relation &lt;math&gt; P = 0.003 v^2 &lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt; P = 0.029 v^2 &lt;/math&gt; for pascals and m/s) is fairly correct.

In the tube anemometer also it is really the pressure that is measured, although the scale is usually graduated as a velocity scale. In cases where the density of the air is not of average value, as on a high mountain, or with an exceptionally low barometer for example, an allowance must be made. Approximately 1½% should be added to the velocity recorded by a tube anemometer for each 1000 ft (5% for each kilometer) that it stands above sea-level.

Anemometers, such as the one shown below, at Deconism Gallery, are often used in conjunction with windmills, so that the wind speed and power generated by the turbine (windmill) can be logged together in a [[data logger]].

Other types of anemometers include:
*hot wire or hot plate sensors, which measure the cooling of a heated element immersed in the wind
*ultrasonic sensors, which measure the [[Doppler shift]] of sound waves travelling across the moving air.

'''''Archaeopteryx''''' (ahr-kee-OP-ter-ix) meaning &quot;ancient wing&quot; ([[Greek language|Greek]] archaio = ancient + pteryx = wing), from the [[Late Jurassic]] of Germany, is the earliest and most primitive known [[bird]]. The discovery of the first intact specimen, ''Archaeopteryx lithographica'', in 1861, two years after [[Charles Darwin]] published [[The Origin of Species]], set off a firestorm of debate about [[evolution]] and the role of [[transitional fossil]]s that endures to this day. 

Over the years, ten specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' have been found. &quot;All ten fossils were found in a limestone deposit near [[Solnhofen]], Germany.&quot; [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/12/1201_051201_archaeopteryx.html] The fine-grained limestone, which preserves detailed casts of features not often fossilized, is used by artists and printers for [[lithography|lithographic plates]], hence the name ''lithographica''. 

In the 1990s, the discovery of a number of well-preserved [[feathered dinosaurs]] in [[China]] solidified the link between dinosaurs and birds.

== Primitive bird ==

''Archaeopteryx'' was similar in size and shape to a [[magpie]], with short, broad [[wing]]s and a long [[tail]]. The [[feathers]] resemble those of living birds, but ''Archaeopteryx'' was rather different from any bird we know of today: it had jaws lined with sharp [[teeth]], three [[finger]]s ending in curving claws, and a long bony tail.

''Archaeopteryx'' is a powerful piece of evidence that birds evolved from [[dinosaur]]s. The skeleton is most similar to the dinosaurs of the [[biological family|families]] [[Dromaeosauridae]] and [[Troodontidae]]. Although it is probably close to the ancestry of modern birds, it is probably not the direct ancestor of living birds. Assertions that the Triassic ''[[Protoavis]]'' was an earlier bird are considered to be unproven by most [[paleontologist]]s.


== Fly or hop? ==
There is some controversy about whether ''Archaeopteryx'' could genuinely [[flight|fly]], or only hop around and [[gliding|glide]] from trees. The lack of a large [[breastbone]] suggests it was not a strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the bird's thick, boomerang-shaped [[wishbone]], a birdlike feature. The large wings and long tail suggest that it was both stable and maneuverable in the air. The shape of the wings is similar to birds which fly through trees and brush.

In 2004, scientists analyzing a detailed [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] of ''Archaeopteryx'''s [[braincase]] concluded that its [[brain]] was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan.  The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain.  Other well developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination. (Winter, 2004)  The skull scan also revealed the structure of the inner [[ear]].  The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that ''Archaeopteryx'' had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception and coordination needed to fly. (Alnso, ''et al.'', 2004)

''Archaeopteryx'' continues to play an important part in scientific debates about the origin and [[evolution]] of birds. Some scientists see ''Archaeopteryx'' as climbing through the trees like a [[squirrel]], following the idea that birds evolved from tree-dwelling gliders (the &quot;trees down&quot; hypothesis for the evolution of flight proposed by [[O.C. Marsh]]). Other scientists see ''Archaeopteryx'' as running quickly along the ground, supporting the idea that birds evolved flight by running (the &quot;ground up&quot; hypothesis proposed by [[Samuel Wendall Williston]]).  So far, ''Archaeopteryx'' has perhaps produced as many questions as answers, and the latest findings on this fossil are unlikely to be the last word.

The &quot;Thermopolis&quot; specimen, recently donated to the [[Wyoming Dinosaur Center]] in [[Thermopolis, Wyoming]] and described in the December 2, 2005 ''Science'' journal article &quot;A well-preserved Archaeopteryx specimen with theropod features&quot;, shows that the ''Archaeopteryx'' lacked a reversed toe&amp;mdash;a universal feature of birds&amp;mdash;limiting its ability to perch in trees and implying a terrestrial lifestyle. This has been interpreted as evidence of [[Theropoda|theropod]] ancestry.  The specimen also has a hyperextendible second toe. &quot;Until now, the feature was thought to belong only to the species' close relatives, the [[Deinonychosauria|deinonychosaurs]].&quot; [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/12/1201_051201_archaeopteryx_2.html]

==Taxonomy==
[[Image:Archaeopteryx.jpg|thumb|''Archaeopteryx'' fossil, the ''Berlin Specimen'']]
The relationships of the  specimens are problematic; most specimens have been given their own species at one point or another. The Berlin specimen has been referred to ''Archaeopteryx siemensii'', the Eichstatt specimen to ''Jurapteryx recurva'', the Munich specimen to ''Archaeopteryx bavarica'' and the Solnhofen specimen was referred to ''Wellnhoferia grandis''. Recently, it has been argued that all specimens belong to the same species (''[[New Scientist]]'', [[17 April]] [[2004]], p.17). However, significant differences exist between the specimens. In particular, the Munich and Eichstatt specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Solnhofen specimens in being smaller, having different finger proportions, and in having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth. These differences are as large as or larger than the differences seen today between adults of different bird species. However, it is also possible that these differences could be explained by different ages of the various specimens.

# '''The feather:''' Discovered in 1860 near [[Solnhofen]], Germany, and described in 1861 by [[Hermann von Meyer]]. Currently located at the [[Humboldt Museum|Humbolt Museum für Naturkunde]] in [[Berlin]]. This is generally referred to ''Archaeopteryx'', but whether it actually is a feather of this species or another, yet undiscovered, proto-bird is unknown.
# '''London Specimen''' (BMNH 37001, the [[holotype]]): Discovered in 1861 near [[Langenaltheim]], Germany, and described in 1863 by [[Richard Owen]], who made it the [[type specimen]] for the [[genus]] and [[species]]. Currently located at the [[British Museum of Natural History]] in [[London]]. It is missing its head.
# '''Berlin Specimen''' (HMN 1880): Discovered in 1876 or 1877 on the [[Blumenberg]] near [[Eichstätt]], Germany, by Jakob Niemeyer, he changed this precious [[fossil]] for a cow with Johann Dörr. It was described in 1884 by [[Wilhelm Dames]]. Currently Located at the Humbolt Museum für Naturkunde. It is the best specimen, and the first with a complete head. Once classified as a new species, ''A. siemensii''. 
# '''Maxberg Specimen''' (S5): Discovered in 1956 or 1958 near Langenaltheim and described in 1959 by [[Heller]]. Currently missing, though it was once exhibited at the [[Maxberg Museum]] in Solnhofen. It belonged to Eduard Opitsch, who loaned it to the museum. After his death in 1992 the specimen was discovered to be missing, and may have been stolen or sold. It is composed of a torso.
# '''Haarlem Specimen''' (TM 6428, also known as the ''Teyler Specimen''): Discovered in 1855 near [[Riedenburg]], Germany and described as a ''[[Pterodactylus]] crassipes'' in 1875 by Meyer, it was reclassified in 1970 by [[John Ostrom]]. Currently located at the [[Teyler Museum]] in [[Haarlem]], the Netherlands. The very first specimen, despite the classification error.
# '''Eichstätt Specimen''' (JM 2257): Discovered in 1951 or 1955 near [[Workerszell]], Germany and described by [[Peter Wellnhofer]] in 1974. Currently located at the [[Jura Museum]] in [[Eichstätt]], Germany. It is the smallest specimen, and has the second best head. Possibly a separate genus, ''Jurapteryx recurva'', or species ''A. recurva''.
# '''Munich Specimen''' (S6, formerly known as the ''Solnhofen-Aktien-Verein Specimen''): Discovered in 1991 near Langenaltheim and described in 1993 by Wellnhofer. Currently located located at the [[Paläontologische Museum München]] in [[Munich]]. Only specimen with a breastbone ([[sternum]]). May be a new species, ''A. bavarica''.
# '''Solnhofen Specimen''' (BSP 1999): Discovered in the 1960s near [[Eichstätt]], Germany and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer. Currently located at the [[Bürgermeister-Müller-Museum]] in Solnhofen. It was originally classified as a ''[[Compsognathus]]'' by an amateur collector. May belong to a separate genus and species, ''Wellnhoferia grandis''.
# '''Thermopolis Specimen''' Discovered in Germany.  Long in a private collection, described in 2005 by Mayr, Pohl, and Peters. Currently located at the Wyoming Dinosaur Center in [[Thermopolis, Wyoming]].  Has the best-preserved head and feet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about a cosmological theory.  For the [[Computer and video games|video game]], see [[Apeiron (video game)|Apeiron]]''.

The '''apeiron''' is a [[cosmology|cosmological]] theory created by [[Anaximander]] in the [[6th century BC]].

Anaximander's work is mostly lost.  From the few extant fragments, we learn that he believed the beginning or first principle ([[arche]], a word first found in his writings, and which he probably invented) is an endless, unlimited mass (apeiron), subject to neither old age nor decay, which perpetually yields fresh materials from which everything which we can perceive is derived.

The apeiron was never defined precisely, and it has generally (e.g. by [[Aristotle]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]) been understood as a sort of [[primal chaos]]. It embraced the opposites of hot and cold, wet and dry, and directed the movement of things, by which there grew up all of the host of shapes and differences which are found in the world.

Out of the vague and limitless body there sprung a central mass -- this earth of ours, cylindrical in shape, poised equidistant from surrounding orbs of fire, which had originally clung to it like the bark round a tree, until their continuity was severed, and they parted into several wheel-shaped and fire-filled bubbles of air.

Man himself and the animals had come into being by like transmutations. Mankind was supposed by Anaximander to have sprung from some other species of animals, probably aquatic.

But as the measureless and endless had been the prime cause of the motion into separate existences and individual forms, so also, according to the just award of destiny, these forms would at an appointed season suffer the vengeance due to their earlier act of separation, and return into the vague immensity whence they had issued. Thus the world, and all definite existences contained in it, would lose their independence and disappear in the &quot;indeterminate.&quot; The blazing orbs, which have drawn off from the cold earth and water, are the temporary gods of the world, clustering round the earth, which, to the ancient thinker, is the central figure.

Other pre-[[Socratic]] philosophers had different theories of the apeiron. For [[Pythagoras]], the universe had begun as an apeiron, but at some point it inhaled the void from outside, filling the cosmos with vacuous bubbles that split the world into many different parts.

For Anaxagoras, the initial apeiron had begun to rotate rapidly under the control of a godlike Nous (Mind), and the great speed of the rotation caused the universe to break up into many fragments. However, since all individual things had originated from the same apeiron, all things must contain parts of all other things-- for instance, a tree must also contain tiny pieces of sharks, moons, and grains of sand. This alone explains how one object can be transformed into another, since each thing already contains all other things in germ.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arthur Laurents''' (born [[July 14]], [[1918]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]], [[novelist]], [[screenwriter]], librettist and stage director.

He was born in [[New York City]] to a [[Jewish]] family. After studying at [[Cornell University]] and a stint in the [[Army]], he began writing scripts for radio, and in [[1945]] wrote his first play, ''[[Home of the Brave]]'', a drama set during [[World War II]].  

During [[McCarthyism]], Laurents was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] by the [[Hollywood]] [[movie studio]] bosses and for several years none of his works were used in film. Other plays by Laurents include ''Time of the Cuckoo,'' ''Invitation to a March,'' ''The Enclave,'' and ''Jolson Sings Again.''  He also has written the books for several musicals, including ''[[West Side Story]],'' ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]],'' ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]],'' and ''Do I Hear a Waltz?'', which was based on his play ''Time of the Cuckoo.''  Laurents has directed several [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions as well, including the musicals ''I Can Get It for You Wholesale'' and ''La Cage Aux Folles.''

Laurents has also written two novels, ''The Way We Were,'' and ''The Turning Point,'' both of which became successful films for which Laurents wrote the screenplays.  He also wrote the screenplays for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''Rope,'' ''The Snake Pit,'' and ''Anastasia''. 

In [[2000]] Laurents published a memoir, ''Original Story By.'' In it, the author himself reveals that he is gay and had homosexual relationships with [[Farley Granger]] and [[Tom Hatcher]]. The latter has been his life partner since 1955.

More on the subject of his original memoir: &quot;Original Story By&quot;-
The story of Arthur Laurents life is fast paced, full of homosexual vibes mixed with a love and passion for anyone who did good work.  The business of the business often got him down, however he was great at meeting the right people and getting into the right circles.  The book Arthur Laurents; Original Story By follows him from his tiny home with his family in Flatbush to his beautiful upper-class apartments in Hollywood.  His work was his life.  He had an incredible eye for what was good and what was not.  He would become more than a writer/director.  He would become a member of the artistic community.  A force to be reckoned with.
The story of Arthur Laurents life is one that wouldn’t be complete without at least mentioning the name of his “life partner” Tom.  Tom is 12 years younger than Arthur though he is described as “wiser than I was.” He describes their relationship in a very strange way, saying “Tom had it (confidence in them), mine was shaky.  I was possessive and jealous.  If I were to be unfaithful it wouldn’t mean anything but quick sex.  If Tom were, the roof would come down; it would mean he was really attracted to someone else.  It took time for me to get sane but he was patient and I did.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''AD Police''' is an [[anime]] [[science fiction]] series, composed of the 12-episode long [[AD Police: To Serve and Protect]] TV series and the 3-episode long [[AD Police Files]] [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] series. AD Police is a [[spin-off]] of another anime series: ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]''. The ''AD'' in AD Police is short for ''Advanced'', although there are some mistaken translations as ''Armored Division''. 

== Story ==

The AD Police are an elite group of highly trained and specially equipped [[police]] officers who have been formed to deal with [[terrorism|terrorist]] activities and [[Boomer (anime term)|Boomer]] [[robot]] crimes in the city of [[Megatokyo (disambiguation)|Megatokyo]].
They are too heavily armed and equipped (including power armors like the K-11 and K-12) for a normal police force, and too lightly for a military organization. 

The AD Police are offered a great deal of leeway in their activities, often blockading large sections of the city and causing great amounts of property damage in the course of fulfilling their duty. Despite their dedication to their jobs, however, the citizens of Megatokyo tend to dislike and distrust members of the AD Police, seeing them as corrupt and ineffectual.

== Filmography ==

The AD Police have been featured in the following [[anime]]:

* [[AD Police Files]] #1-3
* [[Bubblegum Crisis]] #1-8
* [[Bubblegum Crash]]! #1-3
* [[Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040]] (TV)

'''Auckland''', in the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]], is the largest [[New Zealand urban area|urban area]] in New Zealand.  It is a [[conurbation]], made up of the cities of [[Auckland City|Auckland]], [[Waitakere]], [[Manukau]] and [[North Shore, New Zealand|North Shore]].  In [[Māori language|Māori]] it bears the name '''Tāmaki Makau Rau''' or '''Ākarana'''.

Auckland lies between the [[Hauraki Gulf]] of the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the east, the low [[Hunua Ranges]] to the south-east, [[Manukau Harbour]] to the south-west, and the [[Waitakere Ranges]] and smaller ranges to the west and north-west. The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow [[isthmus]] between [[Manukau harbour]] on the [[Tasman Sea|Tasman]] and [[Waitemata Harbour]] on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]). It is one of the few cities in the world to have harbours on two separate bodies of water. 

== History ==
=== Māori settlers ===
''Tamaki Makau Rau'' (isthmus of one thousand lovers), now known as Auckland, was first settled by [[Māori]] people around 1350. The region was valued for its rich and fertile land. Māori constructed terraced ''[[Pa (Māori)|pa]]'' (fortified villages) on the volcanic peaks. Māori population is estimated to have peaked at 20,000 in the region in [[settlement|pre-settlement]] times, a figure which would later qualify in New Zealand as a city. Earthworks are still evident today around some of the larger volcanoes such as  [[Mount Albert, New Zealand|Mount Albert]], [[Mount Eden]] and [[One Tree Hill, New Zealand|One Tree Hill]]. 

The isthmus, around 8km wide with Mount Eden and One Tree Hill at its narrowest point, led to the area having great strategic qualities. The isthmus also has the highly productive soils providing [[agricultural]] opportunities, and the two harbours providing diverse [[Sea food|kai moana]] (seafood). 

[[Ngati Whatua|Ng&amp;#257;ti Wh&amp;#257;tua]] and [[Tainui]] were the main tribes traditionally living in the area. The arrival of Europeans, using guns as one of many trade commodities, changed the balance of power between [[iwi]] with the inevitable result of armed conflict. European settlement caused Māori numbers in what is now central Auckland city to be greatly reduced due to inter-iwi warfare, new diseases (especially [[smallpox]] and [[tuberculosis]]), and the common ills experienced by [[indigenous peoples]] from [[colonisation]]. There was a period of migrations of both Europeans and M&amp;#257;ori, one of the initial appeals of the area to Europeans being its low indigenous population.  

&amp;#256;pihai Te Kawau (c. 1760-1869), leader of the Ngati Taou [[Hapu]], was a good friend of [[Samuel Marsden]]. Over a ten-month period in 1821-1822 he conducted a principal part in the 1,000 mile ''Amiowhenua expedition''. This series of battles raged through much of the central and southern North Island. It ended when Te Kawau's Ngāti Whātua forces, uniting with the Taranaki they were embattled with, jointly defended the Tainui Matakitaki pa from [[Hongi Hika|Hongi Hika's]] [[Ngapuhi]] forces. 

By 1840 Te Kawau had become the paramount chief of Ngāti Whātua. Cautious of reprisals from the Nga Puhi defeated at Matakitaki, Te Kawau found it most convenient to offer [[William Hobson|Governor Hobson]] land around the present central city. He and six other chiefs travelled the [[Bay of Islands]] to make the offer and signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] on [[20 March]].

Ngāti Whātua would certainly have expected from English [[colonialism]] increased security and trading benefits. This would include greater access via the quickly developed port facilities for the lucrative trade in produce grown in [[Tainui]]'s fertile [[Waikato]] and [[Hauraki Plains]] for the [[prison colony|Australian prison colonies]] and [[Sydney]] market. The sale price for the initial 3,000 [[acres]] (12 km&amp;sup2;) was for cash and goods to the value of £341. 

As M&amp;#257;ori population declined for nearly a century, so did the quantity of land held by Ngāti Whātua. Within 20 years, 40% of their lands were lost, some through government land confiscation. At close to the lowest level of population, Ngāti Whātua land holding was reduced to a few acres at [[Orakei]], land which Te Kawau had declared &quot;a last stand&quot;.

=== Birth of Auckland ===
After the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in February 1840 the new Governor of New Zealand, [[William Hobson]], had the task of choosing a [[capital]] for the colony. At the time, the main European settlements were in the [[Bay of Islands]]. However, the Bay of Islands' geographical position made it very remote, inaccessible and off-centre from the rest of the New Zealand archipelago.

[[Image:Map_of_Auckland.jpg|thumb|200px|1888 German map of Auckland]]
Even in 1840 [[Port Nicholson]] (now [[Wellington Harbour]]) seemed the obvious choice for an administrative capital.  Centrally situated at the south of the [[North Island]], close to the [[South Island]] and growing fast, it had a lot to commend it.  But the [[New Zealand Company]] and the [[Wakefield brothers]] had founded and continued to dominate Port Nicholson.  Furthermore, it already had a bad reputation with the [[Māori|M&amp;#257;ori]] for unscrupulous or even illegal occupation of land.   

On the initial recommendation of the missionary [[Henry Williams]], supported by the Surveyor General, [[Felton Mathew]], and the offer of land from Ng&amp;#257;ti Wh&amp;#257;tua, Hobson selected the south side of [[Waitemata Harbour]] as his future capital, while setting up a temporary capital at [[Okiato]] (also known now as Old Russell) in the Bay of Islands. The Chief Magistrate, Captain [[William Cornwallis Symonds]], soon purchased the further land from Ngāti Whātua, and a foundation ceremony took place at 1pm on [[18 September]] [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1840s|1840]], probably on the higher ground at the top end of present-day [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]]. Hobson named the new settlement in honour of [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland]], a patron and friend of his. The ''New Zealand Government Gazette'' announced royal approval of the name on [[26 November]] [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1840s|1842]].

From the outset a steady flow of new arrivals from within New Zealand and from overseas came to the new capital. Initially settlers from [[New South Wales]] predominated, but the first [[immigration | immigrant]] ships sailing directly from Britain started to arrive as early as 1842. From early times the eastern side of the settlement remained reserved for government officials while mechanics and artisans, the so-called &quot;unofficial&quot; settlers, congregated on the western side. This social division still persists in modern Auckland.

Eventually [[Port Nicholson]] became the capital and, now known as [[Wellington]], remains so today. The advantages of a central position became even more obvious as the [[South Island]] grew in prosperity with the discovery of [[gold]] in [[Otago]], and with the development of sheep farming and [[refrigeration]], especially [[refrigerated ships]] which allowed chilled meat to be safely shipped to Britain. Parliament met for the first time in [[Wellington]] in [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1860s|1862]]. In [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1860s|1868]] [[Government House]] moved there too.

===Growth of Auckland===
[[Image:Aucklandmap.png|thumb|right|200px]]
Auckland formed a base for Governor [[George Grey]]'s operations against the rebel [[Māori King Movement]] in the early 1860s. Grey's modus operandi involved opening up the [[Waikato]] and [[King Country]] by building roads, most notably [[Great South Road]], (a large part of which now forms [[State Highway 1]]). This enabled rapid movement, not only of soldiers, but also civilian settlers. It also enabled the extension of [[Pakeha]] influence and law to the [[South Auckland]] region.

During the mid 19th century, European settlement of New Zealand was predominantly in the [[South Island]]. Auckland however gradually became the commercial capital. Market gardens were planted on the outskirts, while [[kauri]] tree logging and gum digging opened up the [[Waitakere Ranges]]. 

A Russian scare at the end of the century caused coastal guns to be bought and fortifications built, notably at [[Devonport, New Zealand|Devonport]] and on [[Waiheke Island]], where they can still be seen.

By 1900 Auckland was the largest New Zealand city.

In World War II the city was overflown by a Japanese seaplane, chased ineffectually by a [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] [[De Havilland Tiger Moth]].

In the 1950s [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] was constructed, linking [[North Shore, New Zealand|North Shore]] with the city. 

As flying boat services from [[Mechanics Bay]] and [[Hobsonville]] by aircraft such as the [[Short Solent]] and [[Short Sunderland]] were replaced by landplanes, an airport was opened at [[Mangere]], supplanting earlier airfields at [[Ardmore, New Zealand|Ardmore]] and [[Whenuapai]].

[[Image:Auckland-aerialview.jpg|400px|right|thumb|An aerial view of the central city]]
Following the initiative of [[Michael Joseph Savage]]'s [[New Zealand Labour Party]] large numbers of state houses were constructed through the late 1930s, '40s and '50s, usually on quarter-acre (1,000 m&amp;sup2;) sections - a tradition that survives despite frequent subdivision. Auckland is a largely suburban city: although it has not much more than a seventh of the population of London, it sprawls over a considerably larger area - a fact that serves to make public transport by Auckland's rail and bus systems unpopular and uneconomic.

All four electrical power cables supplying the Central Business District failed on [[20 February]] [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1990s|1998]], causing the [[1998 Auckland power crisis]]. It took five weeks before an emergency overhead cable was completed to restore the power supply to the Central Business District. For much of that time, about 60,000 of the 74,000 people who worked in the area worked from home or from relocated offices in the suburbs. Many of the 6,000 apartment dwellers in the area had to find alternative accommodation.

== Geography and climate ==
=== Volcanoes ===
[[Image:Auckland_Rangitoto_n.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Approaching Rangitoto Island from Auckland]]Auckland straddles the [[volcano]]es of the [[Auckland Volcanic Field]]. The 50 volcanic vents in the field take the form of cones, lakes, lagoons, islands and depressions. Some of the cones have been partly or completely quarried away. The volcanoes are all individually extinct although the volcanic field itself is merely dormant. The most recent and by far the largest volcano, [[Rangitoto Island]], was formed within the last 1000 years. 'Rangi' means 'sky' and 'toto' means 'blood', which indicates it was named by Māori who had witnessed its eruption. Its size, its symmetry, its position guarding the entrance to [[Waitemata Harbour]] and its visibility from many parts of the Auckland region make it Auckland's most iconic natural feature.  Rangitoto is eerily quiet as almost no birds and insects have settled on the island because of the rich acidic soil and type of flora that has adapted to grow out of the black broken rocky soil.

===Isthmus and harbours===
[[Image:AucklandAcrossTheWater_2004_SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|250px|Auckland CBD From Across the Water]]
Auckland lies on and around an [[isthmus]], less than two km wide at its narrowest point, between [[Mangere Inlet]] and [[Tamaki River]].  There are two harbours in the Auckland urban area surrounding this isthmus, [[Waitemata Harbour]] to the north, which opens east to the [[Hauraki Gulf]], and [[Manukau Harbour]] to the south, which opens west to the [[Tasman Sea]].  

Bridges span both of these harbours, [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] on Waitemata Harbour and [[Mangere Bridge]] on Manukau Harbour.

=== Climate ===
Auckland has a warm-temperate climate, with warm, humid summers and cool but damp and lengthy winters.  January temperatures average 21-24 [[Celsius|&amp;#176;C]]. February and March are typically warmer than January, and July maximum temperatures average 14-16 &amp;#176;C. High levels of rainfall occur almost year-round (over 1100 mm per year), especially in winter. Climatic conditions vary in different parts of the city owing to geography such as hills, trees and ocean wind currents. Snow has never been recorded in Auckland, although a heavy hailstorm in the 1950s was mistaken for snow by many residents, unlike some [[South Island]] cities which may get snow most years. It has snowed north of Auckland, at [[Kaikohe]].

== People ==
* ''See also:'' [[Culture of New Zealand]]

===Cultures===
Auckland serves as a home to many cultures. The majority of inhabitants claim European &amp;mdash; predominantly British &amp;mdash; descent, but substantial [[Māori]], [[Pacific Islander]] and [[Asian]] communities exist as well.  Auckland has the largest [[Polynesia]]n population of any city in the world.  An almost equally large proportion of the population is made up of people of [[Asian]] origin (mainly [[East Asian]]).  This is due to New Zealand's world-leading level of immigration, which flows primarily into Auckland. Ethnic groups from all corners of the world have a presence in Auckland, making it by far the country's most [[cosmopolitan]] city. It is estimated that over 14 people from other countries immigrate to Auckland every day.

*66.9% of people in the Auckland Urban Area belong to the [[European]] ethnic group.
*14.9% of people in the Auckland Urban Area belong to the [[Polynesia]]n ethnic group.
*14.6% of people in the Auckland Urban Area belong to the [[Asian]] ethnic groups.
*11.5% of people in the Auckland Urban Area belong to the [[Māori]] ethnic group.

(Note that these percentages do not add up to 100%, some people belong to more than one ethnic group).

===Religion===
Like the rest of the country, more than half of Aucklanders are nominally [[Christianity|Christian]], but fewer than 10% regularly attend church and almost 40% profess no religious affiliation (2001 census figures). The main denominations are [[Anglican]], [[Presbyterian]] and [[Roman Catholic]]. [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] and [[charismatic]] churches are the fastest growing. The charismatic and [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] [[Destiny Church, New Zealand|Destiny Church]], headquartered in Auckland, has gained headlines because of its political activities. A higher percentage of [[polynesia|Polynesian]] immigrants are regular churchgoers than other Aucklanders, although church attendance drops off in second- or third-generation Polynesian Aucklanders. Other immigrant cultures have added to the religious diversity of the city, bringing traditions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]]. There is also a small, long-established [[Judaism|Jewish]] community. There is an even smaller [[Rationalist]] group.  Western Central Auckland, particularly [[Mount Roskill]], has been labelled the 'Bible Belt'.

===Social perceptions===
Aucklanders are viewed with varying degrees of dislike by some New Zealanders living outside Auckland. One perception of Aucklanders is that they are rich latte-sipping [[yuppie|yuppies]], with trendy but impractical political views. Some claim jokingly that Aucklanders think that &quot;New Zealand stops at the [[Bombay Hills, New Zealand|Bombay Hills]]&quot;, the Bombay Hills forming the Auckland region's southern boundary. Some people living south of the hills agree with the statement, but regard &quot;true&quot; New Zealand as lying south, not north, of the hills. The word [[Jafa]] was coined as an [[insult]]ing [[nickname]] for Aucklanders, but Aucklanders have robbed the word of its sting by enthusiastically embracing it. 

''See the [[Jafa]] article for more on outsiders' attitudes.''

There are stereotypes about residents in some parts of Auckland. These stereotypes can be a badge of honour, or an insult, depending on how they are used, and by whom.

* [[Westies (people)#Auckland|Westies]] - people living in the western suburbs of Auckland, particularly those of [[Waitakere City]], from [[Henderson, New Zealand|Henderson]] to the [[Waitakere Ranges]]. As a derogatory term, &quot;westie&quot; is similar to [[bogan]], [[trailer trash]] or [[chav]].
* [[South Auckland]]ers - people who live at the southern end of the city; the term is predominantly used to refer to a low socio-economic group with a high unemployment rate and a large population of [[Pacific Island]]ers, although there are quite a few affluent areas in South Auckland.
* [[East Auckland]]ers - residents in the eastern suburbs of the [[Auckland isthmus]], including a large Asian (Chinese) population in [[Howick]] and surrounding areas.
*Shoreboy/girl - someone from the [[North Shore, New Zealand|North Shore]]. Generally perceived as 'spoilt rich kids' since the area is quite affluent. The term is somewhat analogous to the stereotype of the [[Valley girl]] in [[Los Angeles]], though not as extreme.
*[[Parnell]] Girl - the [[old money]] equivalent of the more [[nouveau riche]] Shore Girl. Characterised by a blonde bob and expensive fashions, and parents who live in affluent inner city suburbs such as [[Parnell]] or [[Remuera]]. The stereotype is along the lines of the [[Sloane Ranger]] in [[London]], though, again, less extreme.

== Lifestyle ==
Attractive aspects of Auckland life are its mild climate, plentiful employment and educational opportunities, and numerous leisure facilities. For quality of life, Auckland currently ranks eighth equal behind [[Zurich]] and [[Geneva]] in a survey of the world's top 55 cities.

===Leisure===
[[Image:Auckland-CityOfSails.jpg|250px|right|thumb|City Of Sails]]
Auckland is popularly known as the &quot;City of Sails&quot; because the harbour is often dotted with hundreds of yachts. [[Viaduct Basin]] hosted two [[America's Cup]] challenges, and its cafes, restaurants, and clubs add to Auckland's vibrant nightlife. High Street, [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]], Ponsonby Road, and [[Karangahape Road]] are also very popular with urban socialites. [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]] and Parnell are upmarket shopping centres. [[Otara]]'s and [[Avondale]]'s famous fleamarkets and Victoria Park Market are a colourful alternative shopping experience.

Waitemata Harbour has popular beaches at [[Mission Bay, New Zealand|Mission Bay]], [[Devonport, New Zealand|Devonport]], [[Takapuna]], Long Bay and Maraetai, and the west coast has popular surf spots at [[Piha]] and [[Muriwai]]. Many Auckland beaches are patrolled by [[Surf Lifesaving]] clubs which are part of the  [[Surf Lifesaving Northern Region]].

Pleasant ferry trips go to Devonport, [[Waiheke Island]] and Rangitoto Island.  Pleasant picnic spots are at [[Auckland Domain]], [[Albert Park, Auckland|Albert Park]], [[One Tree Hill, New Zealand|One Tree Hill Domain]] and [[Western Springs]]. Auckland has its fair share of rugby and cricket grounds (notably [[Eden Park]]), and venues for motorsports, tennis, badminton, swimming, soccer, rugby league, and many other sports. 

Every year in March, an 8.4-km (5.2-mile) [[road running|fun-run]] known as &quot;Round the Bays&quot; starts in the city and goes along the waterfront to the suburb of [[St Heliers, New Zealand|St Heliers]]. It attracts many tens of thousands of people and has been an annual event since [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1970s|1972]].

The Auckland Town Hall and Aotea Centre host conferences and cultural events such as theatre, [[kapa haka]], and opera. Many national treasures are displayed at the [[Auckland Art Gallery]], such as the work of [[Colin McCahon]]. Other significant cultural artefacts reside at the [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]], the [[New Zealand National Maritime Museum|National Maritime Museum]], and the [[Museum of Transport and Technology]] (MOTAT). Exotic creatures can be observed at the [[Auckland Zoo]] and [[Kelly Tarlton's Underwater World]]. Movies and rock concerts (notably, the &quot;[[Big Day Out]]&quot;) are also well patronised.

===Work===
[[Image:nz-auckland1.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Auckland [[CBD]] from [[Sky Tower]].]]
Every business day, many professional workers commute from all points of the city to downtown Auckland. Most major international corporations have an Auckland office. The most expensive office space is around lower Queen Street and the Viaduct Basin. A large proportion of the technical and trades workforce is based in the industrial zones of [[South Auckland]].

===Housing===
The most common residence of Aucklanders is a bungalow on a &quot;[[Quarter Acre|quarter acre]]&quot; (1,000 m&amp;sup2;), with the resulting large urban sprawl and reliance on motor vehicles. The regional council is trying to curb this trend, with housing density strategies such as more townhouses and apartments, and prohibiting subdivision of properties on the city fringes.

== Transport ==
[[Image:DowntownAucklandNight.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Downtown Auckland at night.]]

=== Road and rail ===
Auckland has a significant traffic congestion problem. An extensive [[motorway]] network, planned decades ago during the height of the road building era, remains incomplete as of 2006. It is unlikely that this original plan will ever be built in its entirety because it is not economically viable anymore, however a number of crucial gaps do exist in the current network. Since 2001, several motorway construction projects began in and around the Central Motorway Junction (&quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;), while new routes are underway in the southwest of the city and along the upper harbour. Transport funding favours roads over public transport in Auckland, and indeed in New Zealand, and the planned motorway network is large for a city of Auckland's size.

[[Image:CMJ.jpg|350px|thumb|The completed central motorway junction]]
Most of Central Motorway Junction is completed, with the whole junction being completed by the end of 2006. [http://www.aucklandmotorways.co.nz]

The [[Britomart Transport Centre]] which opened in July 2003 is a central interconnection point for buses, trains and ferries. During its planning period it provoked much controversy spanning multiple mayoral terms.

During the 2001-2004 term the mayors of Auckland City and Manukau, [[John Banks (New Zealand)|John Banks]] and Sir Barry Curtis respectively, strongly advocated a proposal for an [[Eastern Transport Corridor]], essentially a new motorway. Vociferous campaigners both supported and opposed the NZ$4 billion proposal throughout the term. John Banks subsequently lost the 2004 local body election, chiefly due to public opposition to the proposed motorway. The newly-elected Auckland City Council has a clear centre-left majority, and new Deputy Mayor Bruce Hucker announced in early November 2004 a major change in direction for Auckland City. 

Bus services provide the bulk of public transport, with commuter trains offering a limited service. However, recent investment in train services resulted in increased patronage of these services. The investment has focused on upgrading and refurbishing the current rolling stock and railway stations. Investment in new rail infrastructure remains limited, but there are signs this is changing. A recent project to double-track the western rail line, completed at a cost of  NZD$23.2 million, has increased the frequency of train services on this line. Plans for [[light rail]], mooted over the years, seem unlikely to proceed. The local government elections in September 2004 centred largely around candidates' policies on public transport, with the incumbent Auckland City mayor John Banks promoting the &quot;Eastern Corridor&quot; motorway plan, and his main rivals (former Auckland City mayor [[Christine Fletcher]] and  [[businessman]] [[Dick Hubbard]] &amp;ndash; the eventual winner) supporting public transport alternatives like light rail and improving existing bus and rail services.

Auckland City Council has prepared plans for an underground railway connecting the Britomart Transport Centre to the western railway line. However due to the significant costs associated with a project of this size, and the prevailing attitudes towards public transport, it may be some time before the project begins. Increased population density around transport corridors and sustained inflated petrol prices may combine to make this project more attractive in the medium term. Also, recent patronage jumps in response to remedial improvements to the existing diesel powered rail network have resulted in greater support for plans for electrification, signal upgrades, station improvements and network expansion.

=== Airports ===
[[Auckland International Airport]], New Zealand's largest airport, lies beside [[Manukau Harbour]], in the southern suburb of [[Mangere]], which is part of [[Manukau]]. It is a major base for [[Air New Zealand]].  Ongoing negotiations concern the development of a second airport at [[Whenuapai]], a [[RNZAF]] airbase in [[Waitakere]], to the northwest of the Auckland conurbation. As the air force is signalled to move to [[Ohakea]] base near [[Palmerston North]], the feasibility of an international airport north of the city is being explored. Many private flights use the smaller airfield at [[Ardmore, New Zealand|Ardmore]], south of the city but within the Auckland region.  [[Dairy Flat]] to the north is used by light planes and some warbird enthusiasts.  [[Mechanics Bay]] near the city centre, was the first international airport, used for many years as a base for flying boats of [[TEAL]] and amphibians of [[Tourist Air Travel]] and [[Sea Bee Air]].  It is now primarily used as a Heliport.  A similar air force facility at [[Hobsonville]] has been sold to private boat builders.

=== Ferries ===
[[Image:Auckland_Ferry_Terminal_n.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Auckland Ferry Terminal]]A feature of Auckland transport is the popularity of commuting by ferry. North Shore residents avoid the chronic Harbour Bridge congestion by catching ferries from Devonport, Bayswater or Stanley Bay to the CBD. Ferries also connect the city with [[Rangitoto Island|Rangitoto]] and [[Waiheke Island]]s, and with Half Moon Bay.

== Landmarks and places ==
[[Image:Auckland_tower.jpg|thumbnail|201px|right|[[Sky Tower|Auckland Sky Tower]] ]]
* Auckland's [[Sky Tower]], the tallest free-standing structure in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], stands 328 m tall.
* [[Mount Eden]]'s summit arguably offers Auckland's best views. It is the highest point in Auckland. However, there is local concern about the environmental impact the large numbers of tourist buses are having on the cone - they're said to be literally (if slowly) squashing it.
* [[One Tree Hill, New Zealand|One Tree Hill]] (Maungakiekie) - a volcanic cone which dominates the skyline in the southern inner suburbs. It no longer has a tree on top.
* [[Mount Victoria, Auckland|Mount Victoria]] although slightly out-of-the-way for the casual tourist, offers a spectacular view of the city. A brisk walk from the Devonport Ferry terminal, the cone is steeped in history as is the nearby North Head.
* [[Rangitoto Island]] - guards the entrance to Waitemata Harbour, and forms a prominent feature on the eastern horizon.
* [[Eden Park]] - the city's primary [[stadium]] and a frequent home for [[All Blacks]] [[rugby union|rugby]] and [[New Zealand cricket team|Black Caps]] [[cricket]] matches.
* [[Ericsson Stadium]] - a stadium used mainly for [[rugby league]] and [[football (soccer)|soccer]] matches.
* [[Western Springs Stadium]] - a natural [[amphitheatre]] used mainly for [[Race track|speedway]] races and [[rock (music)|rock]] and [[pop (music)|pop]] [[concert]]s.
* [[Aotea Square]], [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]] and [[Karangahape Road]]-  the hub of downtown Auckland.
* [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] - connecting Auckland and the [[North Shore, New Zealand|North Shore]], is an iconic symbol of Auckland.
* [[Viaduct Basin]] - Marina in downtown Auckland, venue for the America's Cup regatta 2000 and 2003. It is now a thriving commercial centre. 
* [[Botany Town Centre, Howick]] - a complete shopping complex, one of the largest in Auckland including a cinema, bowling alley, food court and many shops to visit.

'''Albanian''' (gjuha shqipe /{{IPA|ˈɟuˌha ˈʃciˌpɛ}}/) is a language spoken by over 8 million people primarily in [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]], and the former Yugoslav [[Republic of Macedonia]] but also by smaller numbers of [[ethnic Albanians]] in other parts of the [[Balkans]], along the eastern coast of [[Italy]] and in [[Sicily]], as well as by emigrant groups in [[Scandinavia]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]] the [[UK]], [[Egypt]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United States|USA]]. The language forms its own distinct branch of the [[Indo-European]] [[language family]].

==Classification==
Albanian was proven to be an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language in [[1854]] by the German philologist [[Franz Bopp]]. The Albanian language is its own independent branch of the Indo-European language family with no living close relatives. There is no scholarly consensus over its origin. Some scholars maintain that it derives from the [[Illyrian language]], and others claim that it derives from [[Thracian language|Thracian]]. The former group doesn't exclude a relationship with Thracian, but this question is often loaded with political implications.

===How Albanian compares with other languages===

Note: How close &quot;red&quot; and &quot;black&quot; are to Welsh, a Celtic language.

Note: The roots for &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;green&quot; are very similar to the Romanian for &quot;green&quot; and &quot;yellow&quot;. Does this show a similarity with Latin or with other languages of the [[Balkans]] such as [[Dacian language|Dacian]]? The separation must have occured when &quot;green&quot; and &quot;yellow&quot; were not considered distinct colours much as we consider both &quot;turquoise&quot; (cyan) and &quot;indigo&quot; (primary blue) to be &quot;blue&quot;.

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Albanian language map.jpg|thumb|300px|Albanian distribution and dialects]]
Albanian is spoken by about 6 million people mainly in [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]] but also in many other countries, including the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Belgium]], [[Egypt]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]] ([[Europe]]), [[Ukraine]], the [[UK]] and USA.

===Official status===
Albanian in the [[Tosk]] dialect is the [[official language]] of the [[Republic of Albania]]. Albanian is also one of the official languages of [[Kosovo]], Montenegro, and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]

===Dialects===
There are two principal [[dialects]], [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] (Toskërishte) and [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] (Gegërishte), which have been diverging for at least a millennium, and their less extreme forms are mutually intelligible. A subgroup of dialects deriving from Tosk are spoken by descendants of [[15th century|15th]] and [[16th century]] immigrants in southeastern [[Italy]], in small communities in the provinces of [[Sicily]], [[Calabria]], [[Basilicata]], [[Campania]], [[Molise]], [[Abruzzi]], and [[Puglia]], is called [[Arbëreshë]], and a further group of varying intelligibility dialects, are spoken in [[Greece]], by descendents of [[Orthodox Christian]] [[13th century|13th]] and [[15th century]] immigrants in [[Attica]], [[Boeotia]], southern [[Evia]], the island of [[Salamina]], in the [[Epirus]] region and in [[Athens]]. The geographical border between the two dialect groups spoken within Albania proper, has traditionally been the [[Shkumbin River]] in Albania, with Gheg being spoken north of the river, and Tosk south of the river. The two dialects have [[phonology|phonological]] as well as [[lexicon|lexicological]] differences.

Tosk is furthermore divided into many mutually intelligible sub-dialects, which either belong to the ''Labërishte'' sub-group or the ''Çamërishte'' sub-group, including north-western Greece, but not to be confused with the [[Arvanites]]. This dialect is spoken by most members of the large Albanian immigrant communities that have recently arrived in these two countries, and in smaller Albanian communities in [[Ukraine]], [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], and [[United States]].

Gheg (or Geg) is divided into many mutually intelligible sub-dialects, which either belong to the Northern Gheg sub-group or the Southern-Gheg sub-group, the traditional border between the two being the [[Mati River]] in northern [[Albania]]. This dialect is spoken in northern Albania and by the Albanians of [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (Southern Montenegro and Southern Serbia), the UN protectorate of [[Kosovo]], as well as those of the [[Republic of Macedonia]].

Since after [[World War II]] there have been efforts to create a ''Standard'' or ''Literary'' Albanian that borrows most heavily from the Tosk dialect (at the behest of the dictator [[Enver Hoxha]], himself a Tosk speaker). The Congress on the Orthography of Albanian, held in 1972 with the additional participation of delegates from the Yugoslav territories of Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro and Calabria (Italy), established a unified literary language. The resulting orthographic rules were codified in such tomes as ''Drejtshkrimi i gjuhës shqipe (1973)'' (The Orthography of the Albanian Language) and ''Fjalori drejtshkrimor i gjuhës shqipe (1976)'' (The Orthographic Dictionary of the Albanian Language).

(ˆ) denotes [[nasal vowel]]s, which are a common feature of Gheg.

==Sounds==
Albanian has 7 [[vowel]]s and 29 [[consonant]]s. [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] has a set of [[nasal vowel]]s which are absent in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]]. Another peculiarity is the mid-central vowel &quot;ë&quot; reduced at the end of the word. Two dental fricatives exist (/{{IPA|ð}}/ and /{{IPA|θ}}/) and the sounds r and l can be weak or strong. The original [[Indo-European]] phonetic system was destroyed in Albanian after diphthongs disappeared, and unstressed vowels were dropped. The stress is fixed mainly on the penultimate syllable.

'''Notes:'''
*The affricates are pronounced as one sound (a stop and a fricative at the same point).
*The palatal stops ''q'' and ''gj'' are completely unknown to English, so the pronunciation guide is approximate. Palatal stops can be found in other European languages, for example, in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (where these sounds are spelt ''ty'' and ''gy'' respectively).
*The palatal nasal ''nj'' corresponds to the sound of the Spanish ''ñ'' or the French or Italian digraph ''gn'' (as in ''gnocchi''). It is pronounced as one sound, not a nasal plus a glide.
*The ''ll'' sound is a velarised lateral, close to English &quot;[[dark L]]&quot;.
*The contrast between flapped ''r'' and trilled ''rr'' is the same as in Spanish. English does not have any of the two sounds phonemically (but ''tt'' in ''butter'' is pronounced as a flap ''r'' in  most American dialects).
*(1) The letter ''ç'' can be spelt ''ch'' on American English keyboards, both due to its English sound, but more importantly, due to analogy with Albanian ''xh, sh, zh.'' (Usually, however, it's spelt simply ''c'', which may cause confusion; however, meanings are usually understood).

==Grammar==
Albanian [[noun]]s are [[inflection|inflected]] by [[Grammatical gender|gender]] ([[masculine]], [[feminine]] and [[neuter]]) and [[Grammatical number|number]] ([[singular]] and [[plural]]). There are 4 [[declension]]s with 5 cases ([[nominative]], [[dative]], [[accusative]], [[ablative]] and [[vocative]]), although the vocative only occurs with a limited number of words. The cases apply to both definite and indefinite nouns and there are numerous cases of [[syncretism]]. The equivalent of a [[genitive]] is formed by using the prepositions ''i/e/të/së'' with the dative. 

The following shows the declension of the masculine noun ''mal'' (mountain):

|-
| '''[[Ablative]]''' || mali || maleve/malesh || malit || maleve
|}

The following table shows the declension of the feminine noun ''vajzë'' (girl)

| '''[[Dative]]''' || vajze || vajzave || vajzës || vajzave
|-
| '''[[Ablative]]''' || vajze || vajzave/vajzash || vajzës || vajzave
|}

The article can be posited either before or after the noun as in many other [[Balkan languages]], for example [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].

* The definite article can be in the form of noun suffixes, which vary with gender and case. 
** For example in singular nominative, masculine nouns add ''-i'' or ''-u'': 
*** ''mal'' (mountain) / ''mali'' (the mountain); 
*** ''libër'' (book) / ''libri'' (the book); 
*** ''zog'' (bird) / ''zogu'' (the bird). 
** Feminine nouns take the suffix ''-(j)a'': 
*** ''veturë'' (car) / ''vetura'' (the car); 
*** ''shtëpi'' (house) / ''shtëpia'' (the house); 
*** ''lule'' (flower) / ''lulja'' (the flower). 
* Neuter nouns take ''-t''.

Albanian develops an analytical structure of the [[verb]]. Its complex system of [[mood]]s (6 types) and [[tense]]s (3 simple and 5 complex constructions) is distinguishing among other [[Balkan languages]]. There are two general types of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]. In Albanian the Constituent Order is [[Subject Verb Object]] and negation is expressed by the particles ''nuk'' or ''s''' in front of the verb, for example: 
* ''Toni nuk flet anglisht'' &quot;Tony doesn't speak English&quot;; 
* ''s'di'' &quot;don't know&quot;. 
In imperative sentences, the particle ''mos'' is used: 
* ''mos harro'' &quot;do not forget!&quot;.

==Vocabulary==
There are Albanian words which have cognates (of non-Latin origin) in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and there is a theory that the language spoken by the [[Dacia]]ns before the Romanization was a language related to proto-Albanian.

Although there's no documentation on the Albanian language prior to the 15th century AD, it is widely assumed that [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Balkan Latin]] (which was the ancestor of Romanian and other Balkan Romance languages), would exert a great influence on Albanian. Examples of words borrowed from Latin: ''qytet &lt; civitas'' (city), ''qiell &lt; caelum'' (sky), ''mik &lt; amicus'' (friend).

After the [[Slavs]] arrived in the [[Balkans]], another source of Albanian vocabulary were the [[Slavic languages]], especially [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]. The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] meant an influx of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] words; this also entailed the borrowing of Persian and Arabic words through Turkish. Some loanwords from Modern Greek also exist especially in the south of Albania. Also due to the large population of [[Roma people|Roma Gypsies]] in Albania words such as &quot;jaan&quot; or &quot;xhan&quot;  in Albanian and [[Hindi]] mean the same thing which literally translates as &quot;my life&quot; or &quot;my soul&quot; but is also used to refer to a beloved one as &quot;darling&quot;

==Writing system==
:''Full article: [[Albanian alphabet]]''
Albanian has been written with many different alphabets since the 15th century. Originally, the Tosk dialect was written with the [[Greek alphabet]] and the Gheg dialect was written with the [[Latin alphabet]]. They have both also been written with the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] version of the [[Arabic alphabet]], the [[Cyrillic alphabet]], and some local alphabets.

The modern [[Albanian alphabet]] was standardised in [[1909]], and is based on the [[Latin alphabet]], with the addition of the letters ''ë'', ''ç'', and nine [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s.

==History==
The place where the ancestors of today's Albanians lived in ancient Balkans is still uncertain, but they are usually identified with the ancient [[Illyrians]] or [[Thracians]]. The common vocabulary with Romanian suggests that the ancestors of the Albanians and Romanians lived close to each other in ancient times. Some scholars support a &quot;theory of continuity&quot;, which says that the Albanians lived in the territory of current Albania. However, the low number of [[Doric Greek]] words and the high number of Latin borrowings suggests that the Albanians have lived well north of the [[Jirecek Line]], which divided the spheres of influence of Latin and Greek languages.

The oldest surviving document written in Albanian is &quot;Formula e Pagëzimit&quot; (Baptismal formula), written in [[1462]] in the Gheg dialect, and some [[New Testament]] verses from that period.

The oldest known Albanian printed book, ''[[Meshari]]'' [http://www.albanianliterature.com/html/authors/prose/buzuku.html] or missal, was written by [[Gjon Buzuku]], a [[Catholic]] cleric, in [[1555]]. The first Albanian school is believed to have been opened by [[Franciscan]]s in [[1638]] in [[Pdhanë]]. In [[1635]], [[Frang Bardhi]] wrote the first Latin-Albanian dictionary.

'''Adrian Lamo''' (born 1981, in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]), is an infamous [[Grey hat|gray hat]] [[hacker]] best known, despite having no formal education in programming or computer security, for breaking into ''[[The New York Times]]'' computer network and his subsequent arrest. He is also known for attempting to identify security flaws in computer networks of [[Fortune 500]] companies and then notifying them of any found; while still illegal in most places without permission, this can be seen as a form of unsolicited [[Penetration test|penetration testing]].

==Personal==
Dubbed the &quot;homeless hacker&quot; for his transient lifestyle, Lamo spent parts of his travels squatting in abandoned buildings and travelling to Internet cafes, libraries and universities to investigate networks, and sometimes exploit security holes. Despite performing authorized and unauthorized [[Vulnerability assessment|vulnerability assessment]] for several large, high-profile entities, Lamo has refused to accept payment for his services. In the past, his lifestyle forced him to travel up and down the coasts of the [[United States]], often by coach, carrying all necessary possessions in a backpack. Since his sentencing, he has expressed an interest in [[journalism]], studying at [[American River College]], with work appearing in [[Network World]], [[Mobile Magazine]], [[2600 Magazine]], The American River Current, and others.

==Activities and techniques==
[[Image:Lmp.jpg|thumb|left|Adrian Lamo with contemporaries [[Kevin Poulsen]] and [[Kevin Mitnick]].]]

Adrian Lamo is perhaps best known for breaking into ''The New York Times'' internal computer network in February 2002, adding his name to confidential databases of expert sources, and using the paper's [[Lexis-Nexis|LexisNexis]] account to conduct research on high-profile subjects, although his first published activities involved operating [[AOL]] watchdog site [[Inside-AOL.com]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/tech/log/1999/07/01/inside_aol/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityfocus.com/news/119]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200302/msg00182.html]&lt;/ref&gt;. The Times filed a complaint and a warrant for Lamo's arrest was issued in August 2003 following a 15 month investigation by federal prosecutors in New York. At 10:15 AM on [[September 9]], after spending a few days in hiding, he surrendered to the [[United_States_Marshals_Service|US Marshals]] in [[Sacramento, California]]. He re-surrendered to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in New York City on [[September 11]], and pleaded guilty to one count of [[computer crime|computer crimes]] against [[Microsoft]], [[Lexis-Nexis]] and the [[New York Times]] on [[8 January]], 2004. 

Later in 2004, Lamo was sentenced to six months' detention at his parents' home plus two years probation, and was ordered to pay roughly $65,000 in restitution.  He was convicted of compromising security at [[The New York Times]] and [[Microsoft]], and is alleged to have admitted to exploiting security weaknesses at [[Excite@Home]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/2100-1001-261728.html]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Yahoo!]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityfocus.net/news/254]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Microsoft]], [[MCI|MCI WorldCom]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityfocus.org/news/296]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Ameritech]] [[Cingular]] and has allegedly &lt;!-- where are these allegations? --&gt;violated network security at [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]], [[Bank of America]], [[Citigroup|Citigroup]], [[Mcdonald's]] and [[Sun Microsystems Inc.|Sun Microsystems]] {{fact}}. Lamo's techniques are largely unpublished but articles on his alleged intrusions reflect fewer examples of technical skill than of unusual coincidence. 

Critics have repeatedly labelled Lamo as a publicity seeker or common [[criminal]], claims that he has refused to publicly refute. When challenged for a response to allegations that he was glamorizing crime for the sake of publicity, his response was &quot;Anything I could say about my person or my actions would only cheapen what they have to say for themselves.&quot; When approached for comment during his criminal case, Lamo would frequently frustrate reporters with non sequiturs such as &quot;Faith manages&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/2008-1014_3-5076942.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;It was a beautiful day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/Judge+lifts+hacker's+PC+restrictions/2100-1002_3-5076124.html]&lt;/ref&gt; At his sentencing, Lamo expressed remorse&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/16/feds_on_lamo/]&lt;/ref&gt; for harm he had caused through his intrusions, with the court record quoting him as adding &quot;I want to answer for what I have done and do better with my life.&quot;

'''Associate Justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]''' are the members of that court other than the [[Chief Justice of the United States]].  Their number is determined by Congress and is currently eight, as set by the [[Judiciary Act of 1869]].  Associate Justices are nominated for service by the [[President of the United States]].  Their nominations are then referred to the [[United States Senate]] for confirmation.  If confirmed then, like other [[federal judge]]s, they serve for life and can only be removed by death, resignation or [[impeachment]].

Each of the Justices of the Supreme Court has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it; the Chief Justice's vote counts no more than that of any other Justice. However, in drafting opinions, the Chief Justice assigns who writes the opinion in a case when the Chief is in the majority, and thus gets additional influence in case disposition. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision.  Furthermore, the Chief Justice leads the discussion of the case among the justices. The Chief Justice has certain administrative responsibilities that the other Justices do not, and is paid slightly more ($208,100 vs. $199,200 [[as of 2005]] [http://money.cnn.com/2005/07/01/news/newsmakers/salary/]).

Associate justices have seniority by order of appointment, although the Chief Justice is always considered the most senior.  If two justices are appointed on the same day, the older is designated the senior justice of the two.  The senior associate justice is now [[John Paul Stevens]].  By tradition, when the Justices are in conference deliberating the outcome of cases before the Court, the justices state their views in reverse order of seniority.  If there is a knock at the conference room door, however, the junior justice (who sits closest to the door) must answer it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alan Jay Lerner''' ([[August 31]], [[1918]] &amp;ndash; [[June 14]], [[1986]]) was a [[Jewish-American]] [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[lyricist]] and [[librettist]].

Lerner was born in [[New York City]] on [[August 31]], [[1918]], the son of Joseph Jay Lerner, the wealthy owner of a chain of dress stores (the [[Lerner Stores]]). He was educated at [[Bedales School]], [[Choate Rosemary Hall]], and [[Harvard]]. One of Lerner's school friends was [[John F. Kennedy]]. Lerner wrote for the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] annual [[Musical theatre|musical]]s and produced [[radio]] scripts after college.

In 1942 he was introduced to [[Austria|Austrian]] composer [[Frederic Loewe]], who needed a lyricist for an out-of-town musical. The Lerner/Loewe collaboration had begun. Their first major hit was ''[[Brigadoon]]'' (1947), a romantic fantasy set in a mystical Scottish village. In 1951 they wrote the less successful ''[[Paint Your Wagon]]''. That same year Lerner wrote the [[Academy Award|Oscar-winning]] [[screenplay]] for ''[[An American in Paris (Movie)|An American in Paris]]''. He had also written with [[Kurt Weill]] (the stage musical ''[[Love Life]]'') and [[Burton Lane]] (the movie musical ''[[Royal Wedding]]'').

After years of dead ends, Lerner and Loewe unveiled their masterpiece, ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', in [[1956]]. Their adaptation of ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' retained [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s social commentary, and added unusally appropriate songs for the characters of [[Eliza Doolittle]] and [[Henry Higgins]], played originally by [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Rex Harrison]]. ''My Fair Lady'' set box-office records in [[New York]] and [[London]]; the eventual movie version won seven [[Academy Award|Oscar]]s. Lerner and Loewe's next work was the film musical hit ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''. Their partnership cracked during the stress of ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' in [[1960]], with Loewe resisting Lerner's desire to direct as well as write. ''Camelot'' was a hit nonetheless, and became the symbol for President Kennedy's brief administration. 

Loewe retired to [[Palm Springs, California]] while Lerner went through a series of unsuccessful musicals with such esteemed composers as [[Andre Previn]], [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Charles Strouse]]. At the time of Lerner's death he had been approached to write lyrics for ''[[Les Misérables]]'' and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''. In 1978 he published his [[autobiography]], ''The Street Where I Live.''

Throughout Lerner's career, his lyrics captured a sense of romantic yearning, and included witty references and occasional double entendres. His librettos had smart [[one-liner]]s but, for the most part, were structurally flawed.

Lerner was a suave, sophisticated gentleman with an addictive personality; for over 20 years he battled an [[amphetamine]] [[addiction]], and Lerner would marry eight times (one ex-wife quipped, &quot;Marriage is Alan's way of saying goodbye&quot;). The drugs and divorces cost him much of his money. When he died in 1986, he reportedly owed the [[US Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] over $1,000,000 (USD) in back taxes. Yet the only thing most remember about Lerner are his lyrics, among the most literate and passionate in 20th century popular music.

He died at the age of 77 on [[June 14]], [[1986]], from [[lung cancer]] in [[Manhattan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Al Capp''' ([[September 28]], [[1909]] &amp;ndash; [[November 5]], [[1979]]) was a [[Jewish American]] [[cartoonist]] best known for the [[satire|satiric]] [[comic strip]], ''[[Li'l Abner]]''.  He also wrote the comic strips ''[[Abbie and Slats]]'' and ''[[Long Sam]]''.  His given name was '''Alfred Gerald Caplin'''.  He won the 1947 [[National Cartoonist Society]] [[Reuben Award]] for the comic strip ''Li'l Abner'', and their 1979 [[Elzie Segar]] Award posthumously.

He was a native of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]].  He lost his right leg in a trolley accident as a young boy. 

After apprenticing with cartoonist [[Ham Fisher]], Capp started ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' in [[1934]].  It started out in the preexisting comic-strip genus of [[hillbilly]] parody, but evolved into one of the most imaginative, popular, and well-drawn strips of the [[20th century]], featuring outlandish characters and bizarre situations.

The comic strip starred Li'l Abner Yokum, the lazy, dumb, but good-natured and strong hillbilly who lived in Dogpatch with Mammy and Pappy Yokum. Whatever energy he had went into evading the marital goals of Daisy Mae, his well-endowed girlfriend, until Capp finally gave in to reader pressure and allowed the couple to marry. This was such big news that the happy couple made the cover of [[Life magazine]].

Abner's home town of Dogpatch was peopled with an assortment of memorable characters, including Marryin' Sam, Wolf Gal, Lena the Hyena, Indian Lonesome Polecat, and a host of others, notably the beautiful, full-figured women Stupefyin' Jones and Moonbeam McSwine.  Perhaps Capp's most popular creations were the [[Shmoo]], creatures whose incredible usefulness and generous nature made them a threat to civilization as we know it.  Another famous character was Joe Btfsplk, who wanted to be a loving friend but was &quot;the world's worst [[jinx]]&quot;, bringing bad [[luck]] to all those nearby. Btfsplk always had a small dark [[cloud]] over his head.

Li'l Abner also featured a comic-strip within the comic-strip ''[[Fearless Fosdick]]'' (a parody of ''[[Dick Tracy]]''). 

The Dogpatch residents regularly combatted the likes of city slickers, business tycoons, government officials and intellectuals with their homespun wisdom and ingenuity.  Situations often took the characters to other parts of the globe, including [[New York City]], tropical islands, and a miserable frozen land of Capp's invention, &quot;Lower Slobovia.&quot;

During and after [[World War II]], Capp worked without pay going to [[hospital]]s to entertain patients, especially to cheer recent amputees and explain to them that the loss of a limb did not mean an end to a happy and productive life.

At its peak, ''Li'l Abner'' was read daily by 70 million Americans (when the US population was only 180 million). Many communities staged &quot;[[Sadie Hawkins]] Day&quot; events, after a similar annual event in the strip in which the tables were turned from what was then the general order of things, and women were allowed to ask men out without any shame or stigma.  A frenetic musical comedy adaptation of the strip opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[1956]], and was made into a [[motion picture]].

Capp (and a platoon of assistants) kept the strip going through the [[1960s]].  No matter how much help he had, Capp insisted on drawing the faces and hands himself.  [[Frank Frazetta]], later famous as a [[fantasy art]]ist, drew the beautiful women in the strip's later years. 

In the '60s, Capp's politics swung from [[liberalism|liberal]] to [[conservative]], and instead of caricaturing big business types, he began spoofing [[counterculture]] icons such as [[Joan Baez]] (in the character of Joanie Phoanie, a wealthy folksinger who offers an impoverished orphanage one million dollars' worth of &quot;protest songs&quot;). He became a popular speaker on college campuses during the era, attacking anti-war protesters and demonstrators, including [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] at their [[Bed-In|Bed-In for Peace]]. 

In [[1971]], he was charged with the attempted rape of a coed at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. It developed that there were similar allegations from at least four other campuses. Capp pleaded no contest and withdrew from public speaking. 

''Li'l Abner'' lasted until 1977, and Capp died two years later, at his home in [[South Hampton, New Hampshire]].

In [[1968]] a theme-park called [[Dogpatch USA]] opened at [[Jasper, Arkansas|Jasper]], [[Arkansas]] based on Capp's work and with his support. The park was a popular attraction during the [[1970s]] but was abandoned in [[1993]] due to financial difficulties and remains unused and in disrepair.

His younger brother [[Elliot Caplin]] also became a comic strip creator, best known for writing the [[soap opera]] strip ''[[The Heart of Juliet Jones]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ann Druyan''' (b. [[June 13]], [[1949]]) is an author and media producer known for her involvement in many projects aiming to popularize and explain [[science]]. In her writings, Druyan has stressed the idea that people can have a sense of awe and wonder about the unity of the [[cosmos]] without introducing the concept of [[God]]. Focusing on this sense of awe and wonder, it has been said that Druyan is a [[pantheist]], though she has never explicitly described herself as being such.

Druyan wrote the books ''Comet'' and ''Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors'', as well as sections of ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'', with her late husband [[Carl Sagan]].  In addition, she wrote an introduction to ''The Cosmic Connection'' and the epilogue to ''Billions and Billions'', both by Sagan. Alone, she wrote the novel ''A Famous Broken Heart''.

In the areas of film and television, she was one of the writers for the television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'', and a producer of the film ''[[Contact (movie)|Contact]]''.  Most recently, she is the CEO and a co-founder of [[Cosmos Studios]]. She also serves as Vice-Chair of the [[NORML]] Foundation Board of Directors.

Other projects that she has been involved in include the selection of the music on the record on the [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] space probes, and the [[Cosmos 1]] spacecraft which intended to demonstrate [[solar sail]] propulsion.

== Quote ==
* I think the roots of this antagonism to science run very deep. They're ancient. We see them in Genesis, this first story, this founding myth of ours, in which the first humans are doomed and cursed eternally for asking a question, for partaking of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. It's puzzling that Eden is synonymous with paradise when, if you think about it at all, it's more like a maximum-security prison with twenty-four hour surveillance. It's a horrible place. Adam and Eve have no childhood. They awaken full-grown. What is a human being without a childhood? Our long childhood is a critical feature of our species. It differentiates us, to a degree, from most other species. We take a longer time to mature. We depend upon these formative years and the social fabric to learn many of the things we need to know. --[http://www.csicop.org/si/2003-11/ann-druyan.html Ann Druyan Talks About Science, Religion, Wonder, Awe . . . and Carl Sagan]

'''Analcite''' or '''analcime''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''analkimos'' - &quot;weak&quot;) is a white, grey, or colourless [[Silicate minerals|tectosilicate]] [[mineral]].  Analcite consists of hydrated [[sodium]] [[aluminium]] [[silicate]] in cubic [[crystal]]line form. Its [[chemical formula]] is NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;·[[water (molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]. Minor potassium and calcium substitute for sodium. A [[silver]] bearing synthetic variety also exists (Ag-analcite).

Analcite is usually classified as a [[zeolite]] mineral, but structurally and chemically it is more similar to the [[feldspathoid]]s. Analcite occurs as a primary mineral in analcme [[basalt]] and other alkaline [[igneous rocks]]. Also occurs as cavity and vesicle fillings associated with [[prehnite]], [[calcite]], and zeolites. 

Locations include the [[Cyclopean Islands]] and near Trentino, [[Italy]]; [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in [[Australia]]; [[Kerguelen Island]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]; in the [[Lake Superior]] copper district of [[Michigan]], Bergen Hill, [[New Jersey]], [[Golden, Colorado]] in the [[United States]]; and at Cape Blomidon, [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Mont St. Hilaire]], [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]]; and in [[Iceland]].

'''Alexey Pazhitnov''' (Алексей Пажитнов, born [[1956]], [[Russia]]), whose last name is sometimes transliterated Pajitnov, is a [[Russia|Russian]] [[computer]] engineer, who developed the popular [[game]] ''[[Tetris]]'' while working for the Computer Centre of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government-founded [[R&amp;D]] centre.
==Biography==


Pazhitnov created Tetris with the help of [[Dmitry Pavlovsky]] and [[Vadim Gerasimov]] in 1985. The game, first available in the Soviet Union, appeared in [[Western world|the West]] in 1986.
Pazhitnov also created the lesser known sequel to Tetris, entitled [[Welltris]], which has the same principle but in a [[3D computer graphics|three dimensional]] environment were you see the &quot;board&quot; from above. Screen shots are available [http://www.mds.mdh.se/~frv95pen/game/tetris/welltris/ here]
The Soviet [[bureaucracy]] licensed and managed Tetris, and advertised it with the slogan ''&quot;From Russia with Love&quot;''.

'''Alternative hip hop''' or '''Underground rap''' is a [[musical genre|style]] of [[hip hop music]] distinguished by beats, samples, and lyrics that differ from the general template of popular commercial hip hop.  Positive lyrics are often a hallmark of alternative hip hop, which detract from the materialistic and sexually fueled lyrics of mainstream hip hop.  Although some listeners may associate live instrumentation with alternative hip hop, this distinction is invalid because popular rap acts like [[J-Kwon]] and The Roots use live instruments as well.  Alternative hip hop artists generally have not achieved the same level of mainstream success that commercial rap and other forms of the genre have seen, although they are often critically acclaimed. Interestingly, alternative hip hop has developed differently from virtually every other [[musical genre]], with its originators ([[De La Soul]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]]) being more popular than later innovators ([[Guru (rapper)|Guru]], [[Mos Def]], [[Common]]).  This is why some consider alternative hip hop more a trend than a rigid genre within hip hop.

The term &quot;alternative hip hop&quot;, coined by music scholars, can be considered something of a misnomer: artists labeled as &quot;alternative hip hop&quot; musicians usually record and perform in styles that are more closely related to the original concepts and styles of hip hop music and [[hip hop culture]], as opposed to their more popular [[gangsta rap|commercial counterparts]].  [[DJ Kool Herc]], the inventor of hip hop music, once said in an essay about hip hop, that &quot;it's not about keeping it real.  It's about keeping it right.&quot;  In this sense, many would argue that alternative hip hop might not be so much an alternative as much as it is a continuation of the original concepts and ideals of hip hop. 

==The late 1980s==

|}Alternative hip hop is usually said to have begun with [[De La Soul]]'s landmark ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]]'' ([[1989]], [[1989 in music]]). The trio's distinctive style, mixing unique sampling sources (such as [[The Turtles]] and [[Johnny Cash]]) with spacey, [[hippie]]-ish lyrics and a sense of humor, made the album a commercial and critical success. With its inclusion of pre-recorded bits from outlandish sources, such as a [[French language]] instruction tape, the release foreshadowed the self-referential [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] kaleidoscope that would soon envelop hip hop (and pop music in general).

In addition to ''3 Feet High and Rising'', influential singles were released one year previously, in [[1988]] (see [[1988 in music]]), by [[Gang Starr]] (&quot;Words I Manifest&quot;) and [[Stetsasonic]] (&quot;Talkin' All That Jazz&quot;); these two singles fused hip hop with jazz in a way never done before, and helped lead to the development of [[jazz rap]].

1989 also saw the release of:
*[[Def Jef]]'s landmark ''[[Just a Poet With a Soul]]'', which included [[Etta James]], an influential [[1960s]] [[soul music|soul]] singer on one track
*[[Gang Starr]]'s debut, ''[[No More Mr. Nice Guy (Gang Starr album)|No More Mr. Nice Guy]]'', which is often considered the first LP to mix hip hop and jazz
*[[Jungle Brothers]]' critically acclaimed second album ''[[Done By the Forces of Nature]]'', which included [[dance music|dance]] beats and achieved some mainstream success
*[[Queen Latifah]]'s [[feminism|feminist]] tract ''[[All Hail the Queen]]''.

==Early 1990s==

During the early [[1990s]], mainstream hip hop was dominated by the [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] [[G-Funk]] (like [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Snoop Doggy Dogg]]).  Other artists found success difficult to achieve, though some East Coast acts, such as [[Puff Daddy]]'s empire of [[East Coast hip hop]] artists ([[Bad Boy Records]]) gained chart success ([[Mary J. Blige]]'s [[1992]] ''[[What's the 411?]]'') as well as critical success ([[Nas (rapper)|Nas]]'s [[1994]] ''[[Illmatic]]''), though rarely both at the same time.

===The Underground Emerges===
{| align=&quot;left&quot;

| [[Image:Innercity_griots.jpg]]
|}
While [[gangsta rap]] dominated the charts, the East Coast alternative sound began to lose its luster. Strangely enough, underground hip hop, as we know it today, was born on the streets of South Central Los Angeles, best represented by the seminal [[Freestyle Fellowship]]. Consisting of members Aceyalone, Mikah 9, P.E.A.C.E., and Self Jupiter, the [[Freestyle Fellowship]] married conscious lyrics with spectacular, jazz-like rhyme cadences. Their &quot;[[To Whom It May Concern]]&quot; and &quot;[[Innercity Griots]]&quot; albums remain as the most influential albums in the history of underground hip hop. Furthermore, the DIY ethic of selling tapes and CDs &quot;out of the trunk&quot; to record stores and directly to fans would soon be adopted by the underground rappers around the world.

Spurred by the Freestyle Fellowship, other West Coast artists like [[The Pharcyde]] (''[[Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde]]'', [[1992]]) and the [[Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy]] (''[[Hypocrisy Is the Greatest Luxury]]'', [[1992]]) also rose to prominence in the field. Despite the popularity of Bay Area [[Booty Rap]]per [[Too Short]], Oakland gave birth to underground artists [[Del tha Funkee Homosapien]] (cousin to [[Gangsta Rap]]per [[Ice Cube]]) and [[Souls of Mischief]] with their seminal album (&quot;[[93 'til Infinity]]&quot;).  Alongside these West Coast groups were generally more popular East Coast groups like [[A Tribe Called Quest]] (''[[People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm]]'', [[1990]]) and [[Gang Starr]] (''[[Step in the Arena]]'', [[1991]]). International groups, like Britain's [[The Brand New Heavies]] (''[[Heavy Rhyme Experience, Vol. 1]]'', [[1992]]) and [[Massive Attack]] (''[[Blue Lines]]'', [[1991]]) helped combine hip hop with [[R&amp;B]] and [[electronica]], respectively.

A Tribe Called Quest's [[1991]] album ''[[The Low-End Theory]]'' is regarded as one of the most influential recordings in alternative hip hop, especially with its timely indictment of the perceived commercializing and demoralizing effects of the music industry, then tearing hip hop apart into multiple competing genres, all rushing to sell out for mainstream success; the album also tackles subjects like [[date rape]] and [[rap feud]]s.  ''The Low End Theory'' includes the legendary [[upright bass]]ist [[Ron Carter]] and the [[Leaders of the New School]] (which included future superstar [[Busta Rhymes]]).

While A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul are considered jazz-rappers, the pioneer of an actual fusion between the two genres is unquestionably the Freestyle Fellowship. Their collaborations with live jazz bands, including the likes of [[Horace Tapscott]], date back to 1990. This inspired other artist s like [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]], whose [[1993]] ''[[Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1]]'' was a critically acclaimed solo debut with live jazz backing.  A jazz band including [[Lonnie Liston Smith]], [[Roy Ayers]], [[Branford Marsalis]] and [[Donald Byrd]] solos in the background while Guru (and guests like the [[Senegal]]ese-[[France|French]] [[MC Solaar]]) raps. 

Stubbornly insisting on sticking to their themes and ideas, alternative hip hop artists were able to incorporate elements of virtually every form of music around at the time.

|}
Meanwhile, [[Christian hip hop]] group and pioneering [[Southern rap]] crew [[Arrested Development (rap)|Arrested Development]] scored big with [[1992]]'s ''[[3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life of...]]'', which put Southern hip hop on the map.  The album was particularly successful with non-hip hop fans, listeners who were turned off by the macho posturing of many other groups, and who wanted a safer alternative.  Arrested Development's focus on peace and love and groovy beats made them relatively accessible, though their devout [[Christianity]] (reflected in the lyrics) also made them unattractive to some audiences.

==Genres related to alternative hip hop==
''Alternative hip hop'' generally refers to a specific style of hip hop that is opposed to the mainstream sounds of [[gangsta rap]].  However, certain other hip hop fusion genres are closely related to this genre, including a mixture of [[1970s]]-style [[soul music]] and hip hop called [[neo soul]].

===Neo soul===
[[Image:LaurynHillTheMiseducationofLaurynHillalbumcover.jpg|right]]
Hip hop also influenced [[R&amp;B]] music in the 1990s. By the time hip hop began to enter the mainstream, R&amp;B was rapidly losing its most legendary artists. While [[Michael Jackson]], [[Prince (artist)|Prince]], [[Tina Turner]] and [[Whitney Houston]] remained popular, the genre was seen as stunted and atrophied.  Soon after, hip hop began to dominate what mainstream audiences thought of as ''African-American music'' with the release of [[Dr. Dre]]'s blockbuster ''[[The Chronic]]''.  R&amp;B became less popular among mainstream audiences, and several of the groups achieving commercial success mostly failing to find critical acclaim.  The groups that did succeed incorporated hip hop beats and [[doo wop]] influences; these include [[Guy]] (''[[The Future (album)|The Future]]'', [[1990]]) and [[Boyz II Men]] (''[[Cooleyhighharmony]]'', [[1991]]).  [[Mary J. Blige]]'s ''[[What's the 411?]]'' from [[1992]] was especially innovative, and lead to a style of [[R&amp;B]] called [[hip hop soul]] that was popular during the early to mid 1990s.

During the mid- to late 90s, the hip hop soul sound was blended with a retro 1970s [[soul music]] feel, resulting in a new genre called ''neo soul''.  Widely regarded as a pioneer of the genre, [[D'Angelo]]'s [[1995]] ''[[Brown Sugar]]'' was profoundly influential in its development, while a group of female artists like [[Erykah Badu]] (''[[Baduizm]]'', [[1997]]), [[Lauryn Hill]] (''[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill]]'', [[1998]]) and [[Macy Gray]] (''[[On How Life Is]]'', [[1999]]) began its popularization soon after.  Around and immediately after the turn of the decade, a second wave of female artists moved neo soul into the mainstream, especially [[Alicia Keys]]' ''[[Songs in A Minor]]'' ([[2001]]), as well as [[india.arie]]'s ''[[Acoustic Soul]]'' ([[2001]]) and [[Jill Scott]]'s ''[[Who Is Jill Scott?: Words and Sounds, Vol. 1]]'' ([[2000]]).  Critical reviews were mixed, with many listeners feeling that neo soul had lost its pioneering edge for middle-class shallow idealism.

==The end of the 1990s==

In spite of neo soul gaining mainstream acceptance, gangsta hip hop artists like [[Jay-Z]] (''[[Reasonable Doubt]]'', [[1996]]) and [[DMX_(rapper)|DMX]] (''[[And Then There Was X|...And Then There Was X]]'', [[1999]]) still dominated the charts as the end of the millennium neared.  Critics and listeners regarded alternative hip hop as going through a lull, as even mainstays like A Tribe Called Quest (''[[Beats, Rhymes and Life]]'', [[1996]]) released lackluster albums.

[[Image:MosDef&amp;TalibKweliBlackStar.jpg|left]]
Many observers feel that [[Dr. Octagon]]'s seminal [[1996]] album ''[[Dr. Octagonecologyst]]'' revitalized hip hop's underground; [[Company Flow]]'s ''[[Funcrusher Plus]]'' is another album cited as redefining the genre. [[Del tha Funkee Homosapien]] paired with Kool Keith's (aka Dr. Octagon) producer [[Dan the Automator]] to make [[Deltron 3030]], who pushed the boundaries of hip hop to other universes and times.  Alternative hip hop soon began to lose its recent stylings for a return to [[Native Tongues]]-style [[old school hip hop|old school]] with [[hardcore hip hop|hardcore]] and [[jazz]] elements mixed in. The hip hop band, [[The Roots]] were among the leaders of the second alternative hip hop wave, dropping several critically acclaimed albums in the mid to late 90s, including ''Do You Want More?!!!??!'' ([[1995]]), ''Illadelph Halflife'' ([[1996]]), and the breakthrough, ''Things Fall Apart'' in [[1999]]. On the West Coast, [[Ozomatli]]'s self titled 1998 release fused latin and funky beats with hip hop in a groundbreaking way.

[[Mos Def]] and [[Talib Kweli]]'s [[1998]] ''[[Black Star (album)|Black Star]]'' also contributed greatly to this evolution, with its return to Native Tongues-style old school hip hop.  Mos Def's solo debut, ''[[Black on Both Sides]]'' ([[1999]]), quickly established him as a darling of alternative media for its incendiary politics, while Kweli's solo career took some time to get off the ground; as he didn't appear until [[2000]]'s ''[[Reflection Eternal]]'', with partner [[Hi-Tek]].  [[Pharaoh Monch]]'s ''[[Internal Affairs]]'', his 1999 solo debut after leaving [[Organized Konfusion]], also added more gangsta and hardcore hip hop elements to the mix.  

Following in the footsteps of the Freestyle Fellowship were [[Jurassic 5]] (''[[Jurassic 5 EP]]'') and [[Dilated Peoples]] (''[[The Platform]]''), who  continued mixing [[funk]] and [[hip hop music]] to critical acclaim and popular rejection.  The Bay area gave birth to highly experimental artists like [[Blackalicious]] with ''[[Nia]]'', as well as [[Lyrics Born]], [[Lateef the Truth Speaker]], and the [[Hieroglyphics]] Crew.

This period was also the high point for Hip Hop's DJ scene.  The [[Invisibl Skratch Piklz]] and artists such as [[Cut Chemist]], [[Dan the Automator]], [[DJ Shadow]], [[Mix Master Mike]], [[DJ Qbert]], and many others put a lasting stamp on [[turntablism]] and its emerging genre.

==Post-2000 alternative hip hop==

After the turn of the millennium, as the United States (still by far the world capital of hip hop) found itself confronted by the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]], lyrics grew increasingly anti-mainstream, with some advocating radical actions on the behalf of various [[anarchism|anarchist]] and [[socialism|socialist]] ideas.  The cover for the album ''[[Party Music]]'' ([[2001]]) by the openly marxist band, [[The Coup]], proved controversial after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] due to its depiction of the duo holding a stick of dynamite and a detonator, ready to blow up the [[World Trade Center]] (though the band itself had been well known in alternative hip hop circles since the early 1990s); other groups like [[Dead Prez|Dead Prez]] (''[[Let's Get Free]]'', [[2000]]), [[Mr. Lif]] with his EP, ''[[Emergency Rations]]'', and [[Emcee Lynx]] (''[[The Black Dog EP]]'', 2003, and ''[[The UnAmerican LP]]'', 2004) similarly raised controversy with militant and confrontational lyrics.  

In [[2001]] and [[2002]], several popular albums were released.  These included:
*[[AWOL One &amp; Daddy Kev]] - ''[[Souldoubt]]''
*[[Blackalicious]] - ''[[Blazing Arrow]]''
*[[Black Eyed Peas]] - ''[[Elephunk]]''
*[[Busdriver]] - ''[[Temporary Forever]]''
*[[Common (rapper)|Common]] - ''[[Electric Circus]]''.
*[[The Coup]] - ''[[Steal This Double Album]]''
*[[Daddy Kev]] - ''[[Lost Angels EP]]''
*[[Hi-Tek]] - ''[[Hi-Teknology]]''
*[[Jurassic 5]] - ''[[Power in Numbers]]''
*[[The Roots]] - ''[[Phrenology (album)|Phrenology]]''
*[[Talib Kweli]] - ''[[Quality (album)|Quality]]''
*[[Aesop Rock]] - [[Labor Days]]

Though most of these bands could be considered &quot;political hip hop&quot; for their lyrical focus, the early 2000s also saw futuristic or apocalyptic rappers like [[Cannibal Ox]], [[El-P]], [[Del Tha Funkee Homosapien]] and [[Aesop Rock]]. 

In the new millennium a new &quot;sub-genre&quot; arose from the West Coast, masterminded by underground rap mogul/producer [[Daddy Kev]] (famed for his work with the Freestyle Fellowship). With artists like [[Busdriver]], [[AWOL One]], [[The Shape Shifters]], [[cLOUDDEAD]], and [[Themselves]], the music became known as [[avant-hop]], prog-hop or [[indie-hop]]. These MCs and DJs blend their rhymes and beats with an [[electronica]], [[post-rock]] or [[Indie rock|indie]] crossover.  Additionally, [[Trip Hop]] artists such as the Bay Area's [[Zion I]] continue to collaborate with their forebears to keep hip hop conscious.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Abdulbaha.jpg|thumb|`Abdu'l-Bahá]]
{{Bahá'í}}
'''Sir `Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas Effendi''' ([[May 23]], [[1844]] - [[November 28]], [[1921]]) commonly known as '''`Abdu’l-Bahá''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]/[[Persian language|Persian]]:عبد البهاء), was the son of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the Prophet-Founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. Bahá'u'lláh, in his [[Tablets_of_Baha%27u%27llah#Kit.C3.A1b-i-.27Ahd_.28Book_of_the_Covenant.29|Will and Testament]] appointed `Abdu'l-Bahá as his successor and he became the leader of the Bahá'í Faith in 1892.  Almost all Bahá'ís accepted him as Bahá'u'lláh's successor.

His [[`Abdu'l-Bahá#Journeys to the West|Journeys to the West]], and his [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]] spread the Bahá'í message beyond its [[Iran|Persian]] roots, and his [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]] laid the foundation for the current [[Bahá'í administration|Bahá'í administrative order]].

==Life of `Abdu'l-Bahá==
===Early life===
`Abdu'l-Bahá was born in [[Tehran]], [[Iran|Persia]] on [[May 23]], [[1844]], the eldest son of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and [[Ásiyih Khánum, Navváb]]. He was born on the very same night on which the [[Báb]] declared his mission (Esslemont). During his youth, `Abdu'l-Bahá was shaped by his father's station as a prominent member of the [[Bábís]]. One event that affected `Abdu'l-Bahá greatly during his childhood was the imprisonment of his father, when `Abdu'l-Bahá was nine years old, which led to his family being reduced to poverty and being attacked in the streets by other children.  Esslemont records that &quot;A mob sacked their house, and the family were stripped of their possessions and left in destitution&quot; (pp 64).

===Years in exile with his father===
Bahá'u'lláh was eventually released from prison but ordered into exile, and `Abdu'l-Bahá joined his father on the journey to [[Baghdad]] in the winter of [[1853]].  During the journey Abdu'l-Bahá suffered from frost-bite. During his years in Baghdad, Abdu'l-Bahá spent much of his time reading the writings of the Báb.  He followed his father through exile to [[Constantinople]], [[Adrianople]] and finally [[Akko|Akka]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and during this time he increasingly assumed the role of Bahá'u'lláh's chief steward.  

In Akka he also gradually took over responsibility for the relationships between the small [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'i]] exile community and the outside world.  It was through his interaction with the people of Akka that, according to the Bahá'ís, they recognized the innocence of the Bahá'ís, and thus the conditions of imprisonment were eased. Eventually, Bahá'u'lláh was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places.

===Family Life===
`Abdu'l-Bahá married Munirih Khanum in 1873 and they had nine children, four of whom, all daughters survived infancy.  Munirih was daughter of Mirza Muhammad Ali, who died some years prior to the marriage.  After his death Munirih Khanum came and lived with Bahá'u'lláh and his wife Navváb and they expressed an interest that she should become `Abdu'l-Bahá's wife.  They were married in the house of `Abbud.

The eldest daughter Díyá'íyyih Khánum would become the mother of `Abdu'l-Bahá's heir, his eldest grandson [[Shoghi Effendi]]. The other three daughters were Tuba Khanum, Ruha Khanum and Munavvar Khanum, the three younger daughters.

===Early years of his ministry===
After Bahá'u'lláh passed away on [[May 29]], [[1892]], the [[Tablets_of_Baha%27u%27llah#Kit.C3.A1b-i-.27Ahd_.28Book_of_the_Covenant.29|Will and Testament of Bahá'u'lláh]] named `Abdu'l-Bahá as Centre of the Covenent, and successor.  In the Will and Testament, it was stated that `Abdu'l-Bahá's half-brother, [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]] should be the leader of the Faith after `Abdu'l-Bahá's death.  

While most Bahá'ís followed `Abdu'l-Bahá, a handful did not and followed Mírzá Muhammad `Alí.  Maulana notes:

:&quot;Many prominent followers of Bahá'u'lláh repudiated his claims.  Among the latter were such important leaders as [[Mirza Jawad]], [[Ibrahim Khairulla]], the famous Bahá'í missionary to American, and [[Janab-i-Khadim-ullah]].&quot; 
::(Maulana, p 44, Also 'Material for the Study' p 145).

Muhammad `Alí and Mirza Jawad began to accuse `Abdu'l-Bahá of taking on too much authority, suggesting that he believed himself to be a Manifestation of God, equal in status to Bahá'u'lláh. ('Material for the Study', p 77).  `Abdu'l-Bahá in many tablets to the West, however, clearly stated that he was not a Manifestation of God, and that he was only a servent to Bahá'u'lláh.

Muhammad `Alí began to make accusations against him to the Ottoman authorities, causing them to re-introduce stricter terms to `Abdu'l-Bahá's imprisonment in [[August]] [[1901]].  It was as a result of this breakdown in relations between the half-brothers that when `Abdu'l-Bahá passed away, instead of appointing Muhammad `Alí, he left a [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]] which set up the framework of an administration. The two highest instituions were the Universal House of Justice, and the Guardianship, for which he appointed [[Shoghi Effendi]] as the Guardian.

===Journeys to the West===
[[Image:Abdulbaha2.jpg|thumb|Smiling `Abdu'l-Bahá during trip to US]]

The [[1908]] [[Young Turks]] revolution freed all political prisoners in the Ottoman Empire. `Abdu'l-Bahá was freed from imprisonment.

With the freedom to leave the country, in [[1910]] he embark on a three year journey to [[Egypt]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]], spreading the Bahá'í message. 

From August to December of [[1911]], `Abdu'l-Bahá visited cities in Europe, including [[London]], [[Bristol]], and [[Paris]]. The purpose of these trips was to support the Bahá'í communities in the west and to further spread his father's teachings. 

In the following year, he undertook a much more extensive journey to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to once again spread his father's teachings.  He arrived in [[New York City]] on [[April 11]], [[1912]], and while he spent most of his time there, he visited [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. In August of the same year he started a more extensive journey to places including [[New Hampshire]], the [[Green Acre]] school in [[Maine]], and [[Montreal]] (his only visit to Canada).  He then travelled west to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] before starting to return east at the end of October.  On [[December 5]], [[1912]] he set sail back to Europe. 

Back in Europe, he visited [[London]], [[Paris]] (where he stayed for two months), [[Stuttgart]], [[Budapest]], and [[Vienna]].  Finally on [[June 12]], [[1913]] he returnd to [[Egypt]], where he stayed for six months before returnig to [[Haifa]].

===Final years===
During [[World War I]] `Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in Palestine, under the continued threat of Allied bombardment and threats from the Turkish commander.  As the war ended, the British Mandate over Palestine brought relative security to `Abdu'l-Bahá.  During his final year, a growing number of visitors and pilgims came to see him in [[Haifa]].

On [[April 27]], [[1920]], he gained the title of &quot;sir&quot; when he was awarded a [[knighthood]] by the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] for his humanitarian efforts during the war. `Abdu'l-Bahá died on [[November 28]], [[1921]]. On his funeral, Esslemont notes:
:&quot;... a funeral the like of which Haifa, nay Palestine itself, had surely never seen... so deep was the feeling that brought so many thousands of mourners together, representative of so many religions, races and tongues.&quot; 
::(p 77, quoting 'The Passing of `Abdu'l-Bahá&quot;, by Lady Blomfield and Shoghi Effendi, pp 11, 12)

He is buried in the front room of the [[Shrine of the Báb]] on [[Mount Carmel]].  Plans are in place to one day build a [[Shrine of `Abdu'l-Bahá]].  In his Will and Testament he appointed His grandson [[Shoghi Effendi|Shoghi Effendi Rabbani]] as the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ambrose of Alexandria''' (died about [[250]] AD) was a friend of [[Origen]]. 

Attracted by Origen's fame as a teacher, he visited his school about [[212]], and was converted by Origen from the [[heresy]] of the [[Valentinius|Valentinians]] to the orthodox faith ([[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]],  ''Church History,'' VI. xviii. 1). 

He was a sufferer during the persecution under [[Maximinus Thrax]] in [[235]] ([[Eusebius of Caesarea]],  ''Church History'', VI. xxviii.),  and is last mentioned in Origen's ''Contra Celsum, '' which the latter wrote at the solicitation of Ambrose. 

He was wealthy and  provided his teacher with books for his studies and secretaries to lighten the labor of composition (Eusbius, ''Church History, '' VI. xxiii. 1-2;  [[Jerome]],  ''De vir. ill.'', lvi.). 

Origen often speaks of him in terms of affection as a man of education and literary and scholarly tastes. All of his works written after [[218]] are dedicated to Ambrose.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aviemore'''{{mn|afgh|1}} ([[Scottish Gaelic]]: &lt;I&gt;An Aghaidh Mhòr&lt;/I&gt;) is a [[tourist]] resort in the [[Highlands]] of [[Scotland]]. It is in the area known as [[Badenoch and Strathspey]], within the [[Highland council area|Highland Council Area]]. It is in the [[traditional counties of Scotland|traditional county]] of [[Morayshire]] and was in the [[Postal counties of the United Kingdom|postal county]] of [[Inverness-shire]].

The town is popular for [[skiing]] and other [[winter sports]], and for [[hill-walking]] in the [[Cairngorm Mountains]]. Situated within the [[Cairngorms National Park]], '''Aviemore''' is one of the largest towns in the park, with a population of 2,397 as of the last [[census]].

It is the first [[skiing resort]] to be established in Scotland and is also notable for being near the freely grazing [[reindeer]] herd at Glen More, the only one in the [[United Kingdom]].

Though the resort has... variable quality of snow and weather conditions, it is well worth a trip for a weekend or so.

The village was transformed in the [[1960s]] by large developments for the tourist industry, and pavements which were designed by [[John Poulson]], later to be the centre of a bribery scandal.

Aviemore lies on the B9152 (the &quot;old&quot; [[A9 road]] since the main road from [[Inverness]] to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] was rebuilt further west in the 1980s). It has a [[railway station]] on the [[Highland Main Line]] and is also the southern terminus of the [[Strathspey Railway]], a [[heritage railway]], currently being extended to '''[[Grantown-on-Spey]]'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''autonomous building''' is a building designed to be operated independently from [[infrastructure|infrastructural]] support services such as the [[electric power]] grid, municipal water systems, [[sewage treatment]] systems, [[storm drain]]s, communication services, and (in some cases) public roads.

Advocates of autonomous building describe advantages that include reduced environmental impacts, increased security, and cost efficiencies.  Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of [[green building]], not independence per se; (see below.)  Off-grid buildings often rely very little on civil services, and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks.

The process of going off-grid may bring intangible benefits, such as an examination of personal responsibility, a conscious decision about one's relationship to society, and the psychological virtues of independence.{{fact}}

Most of the research and publication of autonomous building is about residential homes.  In the [[1990s]] architects such as [[William McDonough]] and [[Ken Yeang]]  applied environmentally responsible building design to large commercial buildings, such as office buildings, making them largely self-sufficient in energy production.  One major bank building ([[ING Group|ING]]'s [[Amsterdam]] headquarters) in the [[Netherlands]] was constructed to be autonomous, and artistic as well.

British architects [[Brenda and Robert Vale]] have said that, as of 2002, &quot;It is quite possible in all parts of Australia to construct a 'house with no bills', which would be comfortable without heating and cooling, which would make its own electricity, collect its own water and deal with its own waste... These houses can be built now, using off-the-shelf techniques. It is possible to build a &quot;house with no bills&quot; for the same price as a conventional house, but it would be (25%) smaller.&quot;

== Theory ==

As an architect or engineer becomes more concerned with the disadvantages of transportation networks, and dependence on distant resources, their designs tend to include more autonomous elements.  The historic path to autonomy was a concern for secure sources of heat, power, water and food.  A nearly parallel path toward autonomy has been to start with a concern for environmental impacts, which cause disadvantages.  

Autonomous buildings can increase security and reduce environmental impacts by using on-site resources (such as sunlight and rain) that would otherwise be wasted.  Autonomy often dramatically reduces the costs and impacts of networks that serve the building, because autonomy short-circuits the multiplying inefficiencies of collecting and transporting resources.  Other impacted resources, such as oil reserves and the retention of the local watershed, can often be cheaply conserved by thoughtful designs.

Autonomous buildings are usually energy-efficient in operation, and therefore cost-efficient, for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs are easier to satisfy off-grid.  But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.

An autonomous structure is not always environmentally friendly.  The goal of independence from support systems is associated with, but not identical to, other goals of environmentally responsible [[green building]]. However, autonomous buildings also usually include some degree of [[sustainability]] through the use of renewable resources, producing no more [[greenhouse gases]] than they consume, and other measures.

== History ==

Autonomous building is an idea of western civilization in the 20th century.  Inhabitants of cabins, huts and yurts through most of history were off-grid whether they liked it or not.

In the [[1930s]] through the [[1950s]], [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s three prototype [[Dymaxion house]]s adopted many techniques to reduce resource use, such as a &quot;fogger&quot; shower head to reduce water use, a packaging toilet, and a vacuum turbine for electric power.  While not designed as autonomous per se, Fuller's concern with sustainable and efficient design is congruent with the goal of autonomy, and showed that it was theoretically possible.  One of the three prototype Dymaxion houses that Fuller produced was made part of the conventional Graham family residence in [[Wichita, Kansas]], and has now been reconstructed at the [[Henry Ford Museum]].  

In the [[1970s]], a group of activists and engineers calling themselves the [[New Alchemists]] believed the warnings of imminent resource depletion and starvation.  The New Alchemists were famous for the depth of research effort placed in their projects.  Using conventional construction techniques, they designed a series of &quot;bioshelter&quot; projects, the most famous of which was the [[Ark Bioshelter]] community for [[Prince Edward Island]].  They published the plans for all of these, with detailed design calculations and blueprints.  The Ark used wind based water pumping and electricity, and was self-contained in food production.  It had living quarters for people, [[fish farming|fish]] tanks raising [[Tilapia]] for [[protein]], a [[greenhouse]] watered with fish water and a closed loop sewage reclamation system that recycled human waste into sanitized fertilizer for the fish tanks.  As of 2004, the successor organization to the New Alchemists still had a web page up as the
[http://www.fuzzylu.com/greencenter/index.htm Green Center].  The PEI Ark has been abandoned and partially renovated several times.

The [[1990s]] saw the development of [[Earthships]], similar in intent to the Ark project, but organized as a for-profit venture, with construction details kept as proprietary information.  The building material is [[tire]]s filled with [[soil|earth]].  This makes a wall that has large amounts of thermal mass (see [[earth sheltering]]).  Berms are placed on exposed surfaces to further increase the house's temperature stability.  The water system starts with rain water, processed for drinking, then washing, then plant watering, then toilet flushing, and finally black water is recycled again for more plant watering.  The cisterns are placed and used as thermal masses.  Power, including electricity, heat and water heating, is from solar power.

== Practicality ==

First and fundamentally, independence is a matter of degree.  Complete independence is very hard or impossible to attain.  For example, eliminating dependence on the electrical grid is one thing, and growing all of your own food is a more demanding and time-consuming proposition.

Living in an autonomous shelter can require one to make sacrifices in one's lifestyle choices, personal behavior, and social expectations.  Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous houses may require some differences in behavior.  Some persons adjust easily.  Others describe the experience as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or even as an unwanted full-time job.  A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually at the expense of reduced autonomy.

An autonomous house must be custom-built (or extensively retrofitted) to suit the climate and location.  Passive solar techniques, alternative toilet and sewage systems, thermal massing designs, basement battery systems, efficient fenestration, and the array of other design tactics require some degree of non-standard construction, added expense, ongoing experimentation and maintenance, and also have an effect on the psychology of the space.

The Vales, among others, have shown that living off-grid can be a practical, logical lifestyle choice - under certain conditions.

== Maintenance Systems ==
This section includes some minimal descriptions of methods, to give some feel for such a building's practicality, provide indexes to further information, and give a sense of modern trends.

=== Water ===

Water is the most important utility, and is fast becoming a scarce resource.  There are many methods of collecting and conserving water, and use reduction is usually quite cost-effective.

[[Greywater]] systems reuse wash water to flush [[toilet]]s, and water lawns and [[garden]]s.  Greywater systems can halve the water use of most residential buildings; however, they require the purchase of a sump, greywater pressurization pump and secondary [[plumbing]]. Some builders are installing [[waterless urinal|waterless urinals]] and even [[composting toilet|composting toilets]] that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.

Most [[desert]] and [[temperate climate]]s get at least 250 mm (10 in) of [[rain]] per year.  This means that a typical one story [[house]] with a greywater system can supply its year-round water needs from its roof alone.  In the most extremely dry areas, it will require a cistern of 30 m&amp;sup3; (8400 US gallons).  Many areas average 13 mm (0.5 in) of rain per week, and these can use a cistern as small as 10 m&amp;sup3;.  It can be convenient to use the cistern as a heat sink or trap for a [[heat pump]] or [[HVAC|air conditioning]] system; however this can make cold drinking water warm, and in drier years the efficiency of the HVAC system may decrease.

Cistern design can reduce costs and inconvenience.  Gravity tanks on short towers are reliable, so pump repairs are less urgent.  The least expensive bulk cistern is a fenced pond or pool at ground level.

The size and expense of a cistern can be reduced substantially when supplemented with water deliveries.  Many autonomous homes can reduce water use below ten gallons per person per day.  In a [[drought]], water can be delivered to the house inexpensively via truck.  Self delivery is possible by installing fabric water-tanks that can fit inside the bed of a pick-up truck.

In some areas, it is difficult to keep a roof clean enough to assure that the [[water]] collection is sanitary for drinking.  Commercial [[reverse osmosis]] systems provide good quality drinking water, and some people attach devices to remineralize drinking water afterwards, or simply buy bottled water for drinking.  Water makers are available for yachts that convert seawater and electricity into [[Drinking water|potable water]] and brine.

New technologies, like [[Reverse Osmosis]] Water Processors and [[Vapaire]]s can create unlimited amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, and even from air.

=== Sewage ===

Sewage handling is not attractive, but it is essential for public health.  Many [[disease]]s are transmitted by poorly functioning sewage systems.

The standard system is a tiled leach field combined with a [[septic tank]].  The basic idea is to provide a small system with primary [[sewage treatment]].  Sludge settles to the bottom of the septic tank, is partially reduced by anaerobic digestion, and fluid is dispersed in the leach field.  The leach field is usually under a yard growing grass.  Septic tanks can operate entirely by gravity, and if well managed, are reasonably safe.

Septic tanks have to be pumped periodically by a &quot;honey wagon&quot; to eliminate non reducing solids.  Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water.  Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank.  For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.

However, septic tanks remain popular because they permit standard plumbing fixtures, and require few or no lifestyle sacrifices.

Composting or packaging toilets make it economical and sanitary to throw away sewage as part of the normal garbage collection service.  They also reduce water use by half, and eliminate the difficulty and expense of septic tanks. However, they require the local landfill to use sanitary practices.

Incinerator systems are quite practical.  The ashes are biologically safe, and less than 1/10 the volume of the original waste, but like all incinerator waste, are usually classified as hazardous waste.

State of the art home sewage treatment systems use biological treatment, usually beds of plants and aquaria, that eliminate nutrients and bacteria and convert greywater and sewage to clear water.  This odor and color free reclaimed water can be used to flush toilets and water outside plants.  When tested, it approaches standards for potable water.  In climates that freeze, the plants and aquaria need to be kept in a small greenhouse space.  Good systems need about as much care as a large [[aquarium]].

[[NASA]]'s [[bioreactor]] is such an advanced biological sewage system.  It can turn sewage into air and water through microbial action. NASA plans to use it in the manned [[Mars]] mission.

A big disadvantage of living sewage treatment systems is that if the house is empty, the sewage system starves to death.

The approaches above treat human excrement as a waste rather than a resource. [[Humanure]] is composted human excrement, and can return nutrients to a garden. Recycling human excrement  requires minimal life-style changes.

Another method is NASA's urine-to-water [[distill]]ation system.

Some of the oldest pre-system sewage types are [[pit toilet]]s, [[latrine]]s, and [[outhouse]]s. These are still used in many developing countries.

=== Storm drains ===

Drainage systems are a crucial compromise between human habitability and a secure, sustainable watershed.  Paved areas and lawns or turf do not allow much precipitation to filter through the ground to recharge aquifers.  They can cause flooding and damage in neighbourhoods, as the water flows over the surface towards a low point.

Typically, elaborate, capital-intensive storm [[sewer]] networks are engineered to deal with [[storm water]].  In some cities, such as [[Victorian era]] [[London Sewers]] or much of the [[old City of Toronto]] the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system.  In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant at the end of the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.

Autonomous buildings can address precipitation in a number of ways:

If a water absorbing [[swale (geographical feature)|swale]] for each yard is combined with permeable [[concrete]] streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood.  This can save more than $500 per house (1995) by eliminating storm drains.  One fine way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost.  Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates.  In freezing climates, the elimination of storm drains can often still pay for enough land to construct swales (shallow water collecting ditches) or water impeding berms instead.  This plan provides more land for homeowners and can offer more interesting topography for landscaping.

A [[green roof]] captures precipitation and uses the water to grow plants.  It can be built into a new building or used to replace an existing roof.

=== Electricity ===

Since electricity is an expensive utility, the first step towards conservation is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand.  Fluorescent lights, laptop computers and gas-powered refrigerators save both electricity and money.

Using a solar roof, [[solar cell]]s can currently ([[as of 2004|2004]]) provide electric power. Solar roofs are far more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells last about 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas.

A number of areas that lack [[sun]] have [[wind]]. To generate power, the average autonomous house needs only one small [[wind generator|wind turbine]], 5 m or less in diameter.  On a 30 m tower, this turbine can provide enough power to supplement solar power on cloudy days.  Commercially available wind turbines use sealed, one-moving-part AC generators and passive, self-feathering blades for years of operation without service.

The largest advantage of [[wind power]] is that larger wind turbines have a lower per-watt cost than solar cells, provided there is wind.  However, location is critical. Just as some locations lack sun for solar cells, some locations lack sufficient wind for an economical turbine installation.  Paul Gipe (a recognized authority, see below) says that in the [[Great Plains]] of the [[United States]] a 10 m turbine can supply enough energy to heat and cool a well-built all-electric house.  Economic use in other areas requires research, and possibly a site-survey.

During times of low demand, excess power can be stored in batteries for future use. However, batteries need to be replaced every few years.  In many areas, battery expense can be eliminated by attaching the building to the [[Distributed generation|electric power grid]] and operating the power system with net metering.  Such a building is less autonomous, but more economical and sustainable with fewer lifestyle sacrifices. Some electrical utilities either pay or give electricity credits to homes that produce energy and put it back into the grid when it's not required for immediate household use. 

In areas that lack access to the grid, battery size can be reduced by including a generator to recharge the batteries during extended fogs or other low-power conditions.  Auxiliary generators are usually run from gas, or sometimes diesel.  An hour of charging usually provides a day of operation.

Recent advances in [[magnetic levitation|passively stable magnetic bearings]] may someday permit inexpensive storage of power in a flywheel in a vacuum.  Well-funded groups like Canada's [[Ballard Power Systems]] are also working to develop a &quot;regenerative [[fuel cell]],&quot; a device that can generate hydrogen and oxygen when power is available, and combine these efficiently when power is needed.

[[Earth battery| Earth batteries]] tap into the electric currents inside the earth called [[telluric current]]. They can be installed anywhere in the ground, but provide very little electricity. They were used to power [[Telegraphy|telegraph]]s in the 19th century. Earth batteries may be used again in the future, if electric appliances become so efficient that they require very little electricity.

=== Heating ===

[[Passive solar heating]] can heat most buildings in even the coldest climates.

Modern [[krypton]]- or [[argon]]-insulated windows permit otherwise normal looking windows to provide passive solar heat without compromising structural strength.  The basic requirement for passive solar heating is that the windows must face the prevailing sunlight (south in the northern hemisphere, north in the southern hemisphere), and the building must incorporate [[thermal mass]] to keep it warm in the night.

[[Earth sheltering]] and [[windbreak]]s can also reduce the absolute amount of heat needed by a building.  Several feet below the earth, temperature ranges from 4°C (40 °F) in North Dakota to 26 °C (80 °F)[http://www.greenershelter.org/TokyoPaper.pdf ], in Southern Florida.  Wind breaks reduce the amount of heat carried away from a building.

Rounded, aerodynamic buildings also lose less heat.

If small amounts of [[gas]], [[heating oil]] or [[wood]] heat are available for the coldest nights, a properly designed slab or basement cistern can inexpensively provide the required [[thermal mass]].  In colder climates, construction costs can be as little as 15% more than new, conventional buildings.  In warm climates, those having less than two weeks of frosty nights per year, there is no cost impact.

A small supplementary heater can substantially reduce the required amount, and expense, of thermal mass, and also reduce lifestyle impacts with a small reduction of autonomy. A popular system for ultra-high-efficiency houses is a central hydronic (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the water heater.

A new system used in some commercial buildings is to provide heating, often water heating, from the output of a gas turbine or stirling electric generator. [http://www.microturbine.com/technology/whitePapers.asp ]

Houses designed to cope with interruptions in civil services generally incorporate a wood stove, or heat from diesel fuel or bottled gas, regardless of their other heating mechanisms.

Electric heaters and electric stoves provide pollution-free heat, but they consume large amounts of electricity. If enough electricity is provided by solar panels, wind turbines, or other means, then electric heaters and stoves become a practical option.

=== Water heating ===

Solar water heaters are widely useful because they can save large amounts of fuel.  Also, small changes in lifestyle, such as doing laundry, dishes and bathing on sunny days, can greatly increase their efficiency.

The basic trick in a solar water heating system is to use a well-insulated holding tank.  Some systems are vacuum insulated, acting something like large thermos bottles.  The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times.  Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight.

Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible.  Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.

Current practical, comfortable water-heating systems combine the solar heating system with a thermostatic gas-powered flow-through heater, so that the temperature of the water is consistent, and the amount is unlimited.  This again reduces life-style impacts at some cost in autonomy.

However, this compromise can still save 50-75% of the gas otherwise used, and the resulting system is redundantly reliable.  If either system fails, the other can continue to provide hot water until the equipment is repaired, fuel or sunlight becomes available, etc.

But can any building that uses fossil fuel be called &quot;autonomous?&quot; Natural gas can be replaced by methane digesters, fueled by composting human excrement and kitchen scraps, or a biodiesel &quot;co-gen&quot; can produce both electricity and hot water from oilseed crops grown on-site.

=== Cooling ===

[[Earth sheltering]] or [[passive solar heating|annualized passive solar systems]] substantially reduce the cooling needed by a building.  In temperate climates several feet below the earth the average temperature ranges from 4 °C (40 °F) in North Dakota to 26 °C (80 °F), in Southern Florida.  Annualized passive solar buildings often have buried, sloped water-tight skirts of insulation that extend 6 m (20 ft) from the foundations, to prevent heat leakage between the earth used as thermal mass, and the surface.

Less dramatic improvements are possible.  Windows can be shaded in summer.  Eaves can be overhung to provide the necessary shade.  These also shade the walls of the house, reducing cooling costs.

Another trick is to cool the building's thermal mass at night, and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day.  It helps to be able to route cold air from a sky facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass.  On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky facing radiators can cool below freezing.

If a circular building is aerodynamically smooth, and cooler than the ground, it can be passively cooled by the &quot;dome effect.&quot;  Many installations have reported that a reflective or light colored dome induces a local vertical heat driven vortex that sucks cooler overhead air downward into a dome if the dome is vented properly (a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents).  Some persons have reported a temperature differential as high as 15 °F (8 °C) between the inside of the dome and the outside. [[Buckminster Fuller]] discovered this effect with a simple house design adapted from a grain silo, and adapted his [[Dymaxion house]] and [[geodesic dome]]s to use it.

Refrigerators and air conditioners operating from the waste heat of a diesel engine exhaust, heater flue or solar collector are entering use.  These use the same principles as a gas refrigerator.  Normally, the heat from a flue powers an &quot;[[absorptive chiller]].&quot;   The cold water or brine from the chiller is used to cool air or a refrigerated space.

Cogeneration is popular in new commercial buildings.  In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or [[stirling engine]]s powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an absorptive chiller, heats water.

A truck trailer refrigerator operating from the waste heat of a tractor's diesel exhaust was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. 11385 Shipley Road Johnstown, OH 43031, for EPA contract No. 68D98131.  NRG developed a hydronic ammonia gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.

A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a multistage evaporative cooler.  The air is passed through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again.  The brine has to be regenerated, and that can be done economically with a low temperature solar still.  Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50F, and still control humidity.  If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.

If enough electric power is available, cooling can be provided by conventional air conditioning using a [[heat pump]].

=== Food ===

Food production has often been included in historic autonomous projects to provide security. Skilled, intensive [[garden|gardening]] can support an adult from as little as 15 square meters of land.  Some proven intensive, low-effort food-production systems include [[hydroponics]], and [[forest gardening]].

=== Communication ===

[[Public switched telephone network|Telephone]] and [[Telecommunications network|network]] service will probably be purchased.

A increasing number of activists provide free or very inexpensive [[World Wide Web|web]] and [[email]] services using cooperative computer networks that run wireless [[ad hoc network]]s. Network service is provided by a cooperative of neighbors, each operating a router as a household appliance.  These minimize wired infrastructure, and its costs and vulnerabilities.

[[Satellite]] internet service also can provide high speed connectivity to remote locations, but as of early [[as of 2002|2002]], most of these services are limited in which types of network hardware and operating systems they support. They are also not yet on par with the costs of [[cable modem]] or [[Digital Subscriber Line|DSL]] service providers.

==Financing==

If considering a system for the economics, run the numbers with real utility prices.  Most utilities have prices 5-10% below the amortized price of the mass-produced rural systems they replace (e.g., electricity will be just below the fuel costs and amortization of a generator powered from natural gas).  However, many people pay for utilities from after-tax income, so even the simplest home-based utilities can be 15-45% more efficient by creating untaxed value.  Clever purchasing (e.g. in internet co-ops) can cut capital costs.

Unless the area has local nuclear or hydroelectric power, new construction can often afford to make its own heat and light.

In the coldest areas of the U.S. passive solar heat in new construction costs only 15% more than normal construction.  In milder areas, it costs ''nothing'' and is therefore a great bargain.  A passive-solar house usually commands a 15-20% price premium.

In Southern California, new solar roofs already provide cheaper electricity than utilities, because they keep the rain out, and the amortized cost of such electricity is cheaper than the power prices.  In most great plains areas, a 10-meter wind turbine on a hundred-foot (30 m) tower will run an all-electric house, for 10% or less of a new house's cost.

Sewage and water are more marginal.  Local health regulations can be problematic, and bulk water and sewage services are usually cheap.  Water and sewage systems also have unattractive costs, lifestyle and mechanical reliability issues.  Groundwater poisoning, deep green beliefs and high utility prices can motivate installations.

In all rural and most suburban areas buying land for swales instead of digging storm-drains creates a more valuable and more pleasant building.

{{Hiero|Anubis|&lt;hiero&gt;i-n:p-w-E16&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
'''Anubis''' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the ancient [[god]] in [[Egyptian mythology]] whose [[hieroglyph]]ic is more accurately spelt '''Anpu''' (also '''Anup''', '''Anupu''', '''Wip''', '''Ienpw''', '''Inepu''', '''Yinepu''', or '''Inpw'''). He is also known as Sekhem Em Pet. Prayers to Anubis have been found carved on the most ancient tombs in Egypt; indeed, the [[Unas]] text (line 70) associates him with the [[Eye of Horus]].

==Lord of the dead==
[[Image:Anubis standing.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Anubis]]
Originally, in the [[Ogdoad]] system, he was god of the [[duat|underworld]], and his name is frequently thought to have reflected this, meaning something like ''[[putrefaction]]''. He was said to have a wife, '''Anput''' (who was really just his female aspect, her name being his with an additional feminine [[suffix]]: the ''t''), who was depicted exactly the same, though feminine. His father was originally said to be [[Ra]], as he was the creator god, and thus his mother was said to be [[Hesat]], Ra's wife, who later was identified as [[Hathor]] (who her identity was remarkably similar to). As lord of the underworld, Anubis was identified as the father of [[Kebechet]], the goddess of the purification of bodily organs due to be placed in [[canopic jar]]s during [[Mummy|mummification]]. 

[[Dog]]s and [[jackal]]s often loitered at the edges of the desert, especially near the cemeteries where the dead were buried; in fact, it is thought that the Egyptians began the practice of making elaborate graves and tombs in order to protect the dead from desecration by jackals. In consequence, Anubis was usually thought of as a jackal, an association reinforced by certain variations of his hieroglyph, which can be translated as ''young dog''. Thus, ancient Egyptian texts say that Anubis, like a jackal, silently walked through the shadows of life and death and lurked in dark places, watchful by day as well as by night.

In [[art]], he was usually depicted as a man with the head of a [[jackal]] and alert [[ear]]s, often wearing a [[ribbon]], and wielding a [[whip (implement)|whip]]. On very rare occasions, Anubis was shown fully human, or slightly more frequently as fully jackal. However, Anubis was also depicted as [[black]], rather than [[brown]], the colour of jackals, since black was the [[color|colour]] that the body turned as a result of [[Mummy|mummification]].

As ruler over the dead, he was given titles such as ''He who is set upon his mountain'', in reference to his sitting atop desert cliffs to guard multiple [[necropolis]], and '''Chontamenti''' (also spelt '''Khentimentiu''', and '''Khentamenti'''), meaning ''Lord of the Westerners'', in reference to Egyptian belief that the entrance to the underworld was towards the west, since that was the direction in which the sun set. As ruler, he was also said to have been victorious over the dark forces (described as ''[[nine bows]]''), which also, naturally, lurk in the underworld, gaining him the title ''Jackal ruler of the bows''.

As king of the underworld, he was also considered to be the one who weighed the [[Egyptian soul|heart of the dead]] against the feather of [[Maàt]] (the concept of truth), gaining him the title ''He who counts the hearts''. One of the reasons that the ancient Egyptians took such care to preserve their dead with sweet-smelling herbs was that it became believed Anubis would check each person with his keen canine nose.  Only if they smelled pure would he allow them to enter the Kingdom of the Dead.

==Embalmer==
[[Image:Anubis statuette 2.jpg|thumb|Statuette of Anubis]]

Following the merging of the [[Ennead]] and [[Ogdoad]] belief systems, as a result of the identification of [[Atum]] with [[Ra]], and their compatibility, Anubis became considered a lesser god in the underworld, giving way to the more popular [[Osiris]]. Indeed, when the [[Legend of Osiris and Isis]] emerged, it was said that when Osiris had died, Anubis stood down from his position out of respect for Osiris.

Since he had been more associated with beliefs about the weighing of the heart than had Osiris, Anubis retained this aspect, and became considered more the [[gatekeeper]] of the underworld, the ''Guardian of the veil'' (of ''death''). As such, he was said to protect souls as they journeyed there, and thus be the patron of [[lost soul]]s (and consequently [[orphan]]s). Rather than god of death, he had become god of dying, and consequently funeral arrangements. It was as the god of dying that his identity merged with that of [[Wepwawet]], a similar jackal-headed god, associated with funerary practice, who had been worshipped in [[Upper Egypt]], whereas Anubis' cult had centred in [[Lower Egypt]].

As one of the most important funerary rites in Egypt involved the process of [[embalming]], so it was that Anubis became the god of embalming, in the process gaining titles such as ''He who belongs to the mummy wrappings'', and ''He who is before the divine [embalming] [[booth]]''. High priests often wore the Anubis mask to perform the ceremonial deeds of embalming. It also became said, frequently in the [[Book of the dead]], that it had been Anubis who embalmed the dead body of Osiris, with the assistance of the other main funerary deities involved - Nepthys, and Isis. Having become god of embalming, Anubis became strongly associated with the (currently) mysterious and ancient [[imiut fetish]], present during funerary rites, and [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]], who by this time was goddess of ointment, initially became thought of as his mother.

However, as lesser of the two gods of the underworld, he gradually became considered the son of Osiris, but Osiris' wife, Isis, was not considered his mother, since she too inappropriately was associated with life. Instead, his mother became considered to be [[Nepthys]], who had become strongly associated with funerary practice, indeed had in some ways become the personification of [[mourning]], and was said to supply bandages to the deceased. Subsequently, this apparent infidelity of Osiris was explained in myth, in which it was said that a [[Sexual frustration|sexually frustrated]] Nepthys had disguised herself as Isis in order to appeal to her husband, Set, but he did not notice her as he was [[gay]] and [[infertility|infertile]], whereas Isis' husband Osiris did, mistaking her for his wife, which resulted in Anubis' birth. Some more [[homophobia|homophobic]] versions of the myth depict Set as the father.

In later times, during the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] period, as their functions were similar, Anubis was identified as the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Hermes]], becoming [[Hermanubis]]. The centre of this [[cult]] was in ''uten-ha''/''Sa-ka''/[[Cynopolis]], a place whose Greek name simply means ''city of dogs''. In Book xi of ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]], we find evidence that the worship of this god was maintained in Rome at least up to the 2nd century. Indeed, Hermanubis also appears in the [[alchemy|alchemical]] and [[Hermeticism|hermetical]] literature of the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]].

'''Arthur Jensen''' is a prominent [[UC Berkeley]] supergrade professor emeritus of [[educational psychology]], known for his work in [[psychometrics]] and [[differential psychology]], which is concerned with how and why individuals differ behaviorally from one another.  Jensen is a leading authority on [[IQ]], and his work on testing bias is canonical. He is a major proponent of the [[hereditarianism|hereditarian]] position in the [[nature versus nurture]] debate, the position that concludes [[genetics]] play a significant role in behavioral traits, such as [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and personality traits.  He is the author of over 400 scientific papers published in refereed journals.[http://www.isteve.com/jensen.htm]

Jensen was born [[August 24]], [[1923]], and studied at [[University of California, Berkeley]] (B.A. 1945), [[San Diego State College]] (M.A., 1952) and [[Columbia University]] (Ph.D., 1956).

==IQ and academic achievement==
Jensen's most controversial work, published in February [[1969]] in the ''[[Harvard Educational Review]]'', was titled &quot;How Much Can We Boost I.Q. and Scholastic Achievement?&quot; It concluded, among other things, that &quot;head start&quot; programs designed to boost [[African-American]] [[IQ]] scores had failed, and that this was likely never to be remedied, largely because, in Jensen's estimation, over 70% of the within race IQ variability was due to genetic factors, and the  30% left over was due to non-shared environmental influences (e.g., prenatal drug exposure, placental nutrient competition  when there are multiple births).

When the work was initially published, students and faculty staged large, loud protests outside his [[University of California, Berkeley]] office, and he received multiple death threats. He was even denied reprints of his work by his publisher and was not permitted to reply in response to letters of critism -- both extremely unusual and exceptional policies for their day. Many colleagues at the time felt that even if Jensen's work contained no scientific merit, his treatment was itself against the spirit of science and the free exchange of ideas.

[[Image:Jensen1.jpg|right|thumb|Arthur Jensen winning the 2003 [[Kistler Prize]].]]
In a later article, Jensen argued that his claims had been misunderstood:

:...nowhere have I &quot;claimed&quot; an &quot;innate deficiency&quot; of intelligence in blacks. My position on this question is clearly spelled out in my most recent book: &quot;The plain fact is that at present there exists no scientifically satisfactory explanation for the differences between the IQ distributions in the black and white populations. The only genuine consensus among well-informed scientists on this topic is that the cause of the difference remains an open question&quot; (Jensen, 1981a, p. 213).

[[Thomas Sowell]] wrote:
:Professor Jensen pointed out back in 1969 that black children's IQ scores rose by 8 to 10 points after he met with them informally in a play room and then tested them again after they were more relaxed around him. He did this because &quot;I felt these children were really brighter than their IQ would indicate.&quot; What a shame that others seem to have less confidence in black children than Professor Jensen has had. [http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/thomassowell/2002/10/01/164398.html]

Nevertheless, eugenicists and others point to passages such as the following (from his book ''The ''g'' Factor: The Science of Mental Ability'') to support their claim that Jensen has proven that differences in IQ scores between races are mostly genetic:
:In Chapter 12: Population Differences in ''g'': Causal Hypotheses, Jensen writes: &quot;The relationship of the ''g'' factor to a number of biological variables and its relationship to the size of the white-black differences on various cognitive tests (i.e., [[Spearman's hypothesis]]) suggests that the average white-black difference in ''g'' has a biological component. Human races are viewed not as discrete, or Platonic, categories, but rather as breeding populations that, as a result of natural selection, have come to differ statistically in the relative frequencies of many polymorphic genes. The genetic distances between various populations form a continuous variable that can be measured in terms of differences in gene frequencies. Racial populations differ in many genetic characteristics, some of which, such as brain size, have behavioral and psychometric correlates, particularly ''g''.&quot;

== Gould's criticism ==
Paleontologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]], known for his popularizations of science in mass market books and magazines, attacked Jensen's work in his 1981 book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]].''  

Gould makes three criticisms.  The first is the criticism commonly leveled against Jensen and other researchers dealing with [[race and intelligence]]:that Jensen misapplies the concept of &quot;heritability.&quot;  [[Heritability]] measures the percentage of variation of a trait due to inheritance, ''within'' a population. (Gould 1981: 127; 156-156). Jensen has used the concept of heritability to measure differences in inheritance ''between'' populations, and this is the basis of the criticism.

Secondly, Gould disagrees with Jensen's belief that IQ tests measure a real variable, ''g'', or &quot;the [[general factor]] common to a large number of cognitive abilities&quot; which can be measured along a unilinear scale. This is a claim most closely identified with [[Cyril Burt]] and [[Charles Spearman]]. According to Gould, Jensen misunderstood the research of [[L. L. Thurstone]] to ultimately support this claim; Gould however argues that Thurstone's [[factor analysis]] of intelligence revealed ''g'' to be an illusion (1981: 159; 13-314).

Third, Gould disagrees with Jensen's support of the attempts of others to calculate the IQ's of dead people (such as the famous astronomer and Prussian monetary theorist [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]) (1981: 153-154).

In a 1982 review of Gould's book Jensen gives point-by-point rebuttals to Gould's characterizations of his work, including Gould's treatment of heritability, the &quot;reification&quot; of ''g'' and the use of Thurstone's analysis. Gould's responses can be found in the latest edition of ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1996).

In Arthur Jensen's response to Gould's criticisms, in the paper titled ''The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons''.[http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/jensen-gould-fossils], Jensen begins his paper with this observation

:&quot;Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology and offers a course at Harvard entitled, &quot;Biology as a Social Weapon.&quot; Apparently the course covers much the same content as does the present book. Having had some personal cause for interest in ideologically motivated attacks on biologically oriented behavioral scientists, I first took notice of Gould when he played a prominent role in a group called Science for the People and in that group's attack on the theories of Harvard zoologist Edward O. Wilson, a leader in the development of sociobiology...&quot;

Among a number of other objections to Gould's conclusions found in Jensen's paper, Jensen states that Gould relies on information that is outdated while ignoring present research and information that does not support his conclusions.  

:&quot;...Of all the book's references, a full 27 percent precede 1900. Another 44 percent fall between 1900 and 1950 (60 percent of those are before 1925); and only 29 percent are more recent than 1950. From the total literature spanning more than a century, the few &quot;bad apples&quot; have been hand-picked most aptly to serve Gould's purpose.&quot;

In addition, Jensen indicates that Gould may have intentionally misrepresented Jensen's own views.  Jensen adds

:&quot;In his references to my own work, Gould includes at least nine citations that involve more than just an expression of Gould's opinion; in these citations Gould purportedly paraphrases my views. Yet in eight of the nine cases, Gould's representation of these views is false, misleading, or grossly caricatured. Nonspecialists could have no way of knowing any of this without reading the cited sources. While any author can occasionally make an inadvertent mistake in paraphrasing another, it appears Gould's paraphrases are consistently slanted to serve his own message. Through hyperbole and caricature he converts real issues into straw persons, which can be easily disproved.&quot;

==Recent books==
===The ''g'' Factor===
''The ''g'' Factor: The Science of Mental Ability'' (1998) is considered by supporters to be Jensen's magnum opus on the [[general intelligence factor]] (''g'').  The book deals with the intellectual history of the discovery of g and various models of how to conceptualize intelligence, and with the biological correlates of g, its heritability, and its practical predictive power.

===Clocking the Mind===
''Clocking the Mind : Mental Chronometry and Individual Differences'' (to be published in April 2006) is on [[mental chronometry]] (MC), a variety of techniques for measuring the speed with which the brain processes information.  Whereas [[IQ]] merely represents an ordinal (ranking) scale and thus possesses no true scale properties, Jensen argues mental chronometry represents a true natural science of mental ability.

'''''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum''''' is a [[musical theater|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and a book by [[Burt Shevelove]] and [[Larry Gelbart]].  

Based on the comedies of the [[ancient Roman]] playwright [[Plautus]], it tells the story of a [[slavery|slave]] named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by encouraging the romance between his master's son Hero and a young virgin named Philia who is owned by Marcus Lycus, a dealer in [[courtesan]]s, and promised to a swaggering soldier named [[Miles Gloriosus]].  The humor is broad and bawdy and fast-paced.

Sondheim's score was coolly received when ''Forum'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on [[May 8]], [[1962]], at the [[Alvin Theatre]], and the score was not even nominated for a [[Tony Award]] even though the show won the award for [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]].  Starring [[Zero Mostel]], [[Jack Gilford]], [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]], [[Ruth Kobart]], and [[John Carradine]] (who was replaced by [[Erik Rhodes]]), the original production was directed by Broadway legend [[George Abbott]] and played 966 performances--Sondheim's longest Broadway run to date.

''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' was made into a [[musical film|film]] in 1966 directed by [[Richard Lester]] with [[Zero Mostel]], [[Jack Gilford]], [[Buster Keaton]], a very young [[Michael Crawford]] and [[Phil Silvers]] (who also starred in a critically well-received Broadway [[revival (play)|revival]] in [[1972]]).  It was also revived with great success in [[1996]] with [[Nathan Lane]] as Pseudolus, replaced later in the run by [[Whoopi Goldberg]], and also [[David Alan Grier]].

The show was presented twice in London's West End starring [[Frankie Howerd]] as Pseudolus.  At the [[Strand Theatre]] in 1963 and the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] in 1986.

The '''Aleuts''' ([[autonym|self-denomination]]: '''Unangax''', '''Unangan''' or '''Unanga''') are the [[Alaska Natives|indigenous people]] of the [[Aleutian Islands]] of [[Alaska]], [[United States|U.S.A.]] and [[Chukotka]], [[Russia]]. 
==Location==
The homeland of the Aleuts includes the Aleutian Islands, the [[Pribilof Islands]], the [[Shumagin Islands]], and the far western part of the [[Alaska Peninsula]].
:''For specific tribal village names, see [[List of Native Alaskan Tribal Entities]].''

==History==
After the arrival of [[missionary|missionaries]] in the late [[18th century]], many Aleuts became [[Christianity|Christians]] by joining the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. One of the earliest [[Christianity|Christian]] martyrs in [[North America]] was Saint [[Peter the Aleut]].

It has been stated that before the advent of the [[Russia]]ns there were 25,000 Aleuts on the archipelago, but that the barbarities of the traders and foreign diseases eventually reduced the population to one-tenth of this number. Further declines led to a [[1910]] [[Census]] count of 1491 Aleuts.

In [[1942]] Japanese forces occupied [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]] Islands in the western Aleutians, and later transported captive Attu Islanders to [[Hokkaido]], where they were held as [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s. Hundreds more Aleuts from the western chain and the Pribilofs were evacuated by the United States government during [[World War II]] and placed in internment camps in southeast Alaska, where many died. The [[Aleut Restitution Act of 1988]] was an attempt by [[Congress]] to compensate the survivors.

The [[World War II: Aleutian Islands|World War II campaign to retake Attu and Kiska]] was a significant component of the operations of the Asian theater.

==Culture and technology==
[[Image:AleuWinterHouse.jpg|right|thumb|333px|The traditional Aleut winter house, called a barabara or, in Aleut, an ulax.]]
Aleuts constructed ''barabaras'', partially underground houses that functioned well, as [[Lillie McGarvey]], a [[20th-century]] Aleut leader, wrote &amp;#8220;keeping occupants dry from the frequent rains, warm at all times, and snugly sheltered from the high winds peculiar to the area&amp;#8221;. 

[[Hunting]], [[weapon]]-making, [[boat]] building, and weaving are some of the traditional arts of the Aleuts. [[19th-century]] craftsmen were famed for their ornate wooden hunting hats, which feature elaborate and colorful designs and may be trimmed with [[sea lion]] [[vibrissae|whiskers]], feathers, and [[ivory]]. Aleut seamstresses created finely stitched waterproof [[parka]]s from [[seal (mammal)|seal]] gut, and some women still master the skill of [[weaving]] fine baskets from [[rye]] and beach [[grass]].

Aleut [[basketry]] is some of the finest in the world, the continuum of a craft begun in prehistoric times and carried through to the present. Early Aleut women created baskets and woven mats of exceptional technical quality using only an elongated and sharpened thumbnail as tool. Today Aleut weavers continue to produce woven pieces of a remarkable cloth-like texture, works of modern art with roots in ancient tradition. The Aleut word for grass basket is ''qiigam aygaaxsii''.

===Language===
The [[Aleut language]] is in the family called [[Eskimo-Aleut languages]].  It is related to the [[Inuit]] and [[Yupik language|Yupik]] languages spoken by the [[Eskimo]]. It has no known wider affiliation, but supporters of the [[Nostratic]] hypothesis sometimes include it as Nostratic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act''' was signed into law on [[December 18]], [[1971]], and the largest land claims settlement in United States history was concluded.  The ANCSA, as it is commonly known, did the following:

*[[Alaska Native|Native]] claims to almost all of Alaska were extinguished in exchange for approximately one-ninth of the state's land plus $962.5 million in compensation.
*Of the latter, $462.5 million was to come from the federal treasury and the rest from oil revenue-sharing.
*Settlement benefits would accrue to those with at least one-fourth Native ancestory.
*Of the approximately 80,000 Natives enrolled under ANCSA, those living in villages (approximately 2/3rds of the total) would receive 100 shares in both a village and a regional corporation.
*The remaining 1/3rd would be &quot;at large&quot; shareholders with 100 shares in a [[The 13th Regional Corporation|regional corporation]] plus additional rights to revenue from regional mineral and timber resources.
*The [[Alaska Native Allotment Act]] was revoked and as yet unborn Native children were excluded.
*The twelve regional corporations within the state would administer the settlement.
*A [[The 13th Regional Corporation|thirteenth corporation]] composed of Natives who had left the state would receive monies but not land.
*Surface rights on 44 million acres (178,000,000 km&amp;sup2;) were alloted to the Natives and administered by the Native Corporations.

==The Alaska Native Corporations==
:''Main article at: [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations]]''
The following thirteen regional corporations were established:
*[[Ahtna Incorporated]]
*[[Aleut Corporation]]
*[[Arctic Slope Regional Corporation]]
*[[Bering Straits Native Corporation]]
*[[Bristol Bay Native Corporation]]
*[[Calista]]
*[[Chugach Alaska Corporation]]
*[[Cook Inlet Region, Inc.]]
*[[Doyon, Limited]]
*[[Koniag, Inc.]]
*[[Nana Corporation]]
*[[Sealaska Corporation]]
*[[The 13th Regional Corporation]]

Also, most of these corporations set up nonprofit corporations of their own. Many separate village corporations were also created by the Act.

Land selection by the State of Alaska under the Statehood Act and for the regional and village corporations has continued through the present.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Adoptionism''', or adoptianism, is a view held by some early medieval [[Christianity|Christians]], that claims [[Jesus]] was born human, and later became divine during his [[baptism]], at which point he became the '''adopted''' son of God. Adoptionism held that in his divinity [[Christ]] was the son of God by nature, but in his humanity by adoption only.

It is one of two main forms of [[monarchianism]]; the other is [[modalism]], which regards &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Son&quot; as two aspects of the same subject,. Adoptionism held that Christ as God is indeed the Son of God by generation and by nature, but Christ as man is Son of God only by adoption and grace, dispensed from the moment of his baptism. This position was one in a long series of Christian disagreements about the precise nature of Christ (see [[Christology]]) in the developing dogma of the [[Trinity]&amp;#8212;, an attempt to explain the relationship between Jesus Christ, both as man and God and God the Father, while maintaining Christianity's [[monotheism]]. It differs significantly from the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] that was later accepted by the [[ecumenical council]]s.

There were three waves of Adoptionist speculation. In ''The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture'' [[Bart D. Ehrman]] argues that the adoptionist view may date back almost to the time of [[Jesus]]. One of the early known exponents of Adoptionism was [[Theodotus of Byzantium]]. Also during the second century, [[Paul of Samosata]] and the followers of [[Monarchianism]] expressed similar views. The belief was declared [[heresy|heretical]] by [[Pope Victor I]]. 

The second movement of adoptionism, called ''Hispanicus error,'' in the late 8th century maintained by Elipandus, bishop of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in the [[Caliph of Cordoba|Caliphate of Cordoba]] and by Felix, bishop of [[Urgell]] in the foothills of the Pyrenees; [[Alcuin]], the leading intellect at the court of Charlemagne was called in to write refutations against both of the bishops. Against Felix he wrote:
:&quot;As the [[Nestorian]] impiety divided Christ into two persons because of the two natures, so your unlearned temerity divided Him into two sons, one natural and one adoptive&quot;  
The doctrine condemned as heresy by the Council of Frankfurt (794). 

A third wave was the revived form (&quot;Neo-Adoptionism&quot;) of [[Abelard]] in the 12th century. Later, various modified and qualified Adoptionist tenets of some theologians from the 14th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Apollinarism''' or '''Apollinarianism''' was a view proposed by [[Apollinaris of Laodicea]] that  [[Jesus]] had a [[human]] body but a [[God|divine]] mind. Apollinaris further taught that the [[soul]]s of men were propagated by other souls, as well as their bodies. [[Theodoret]] charged him with confounding the persons of the [[Godhead]], and with giving into the heretical ways of [[Sabellius]]. [[Basil]] accused him of abandoning the literal sense of the scripture, and taking up wholly with the allegorical sense.

This heresy was very subtile; it was condemned in a [[Synod]] at [[Alexandria]], under [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius]], in [[362]]. It was subdivided into several different heresies, the chief whereof were the [[Polemian]]s and the [[Antidicomarianite]]s.

It was declared to be a [[heresy]] in [[381]] by the [[First Council of Constantinople]], since Christ was officially depicted as fully human and fully [[God]].  Followers of Apollinarianism were accused of attempting to create a [[tertium quid]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Acids_and_Bases}}

An '''acid-base reaction''' is a [[chemical reaction]] between an [[acid]] and a [[base (chemistry)|base]].

==Common acid-base theories==

=== Lavoisier's definition ===
The first scientific definition was proposed by the [[France|French]] [[chemist]] [[Antoine Lavoisier]].

Since Lavoisier's knowledge of strong acids was mainly restricted to [[oxoacid]]s, which tend to contain central atoms in high [[oxidation number|oxidation states]] surrounded by oxygen, such as [[Nitric acid|HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], and since he was not aware of the true composition of the hydrohalic acids, HCl, HBr, and HI, he defined acids in terms of their containing ''[[oxygen]]'', which in fact he named from Greek words meaning &quot;acid-former&quot;. When the elements [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], and [[iodine]] were identified and the absence of oxygen in the hydrohalic acids was established by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] in 1810, this definition had to be rejected.

=== The Arrhenius definition ===

[[Svante Arrhenius]] provided the first modern definition of acids and bases in [[1884]]. In [[water (molecule)|water]], a [[dissociation constant|dissociation]] takes place:

:2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;harr; H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

A compound causing an increase in  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and a decrease in OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is an '''acid''' and one causing the reverse is a '''base'''.

An Arrhenius '''acid''', when dissociated in water, typically yields a positively-[[electric charge|charged]] [[hydronium]] ion and a complementary negative [[ion]].  

An Arrhenius '''base''', when dissociated in water, typically yields a negatively-[[electric charge|charged]] [[hydroxide]] ion and a complementary positive [[ion]].  

The positive ion from a base can form a salt with the negative ion from an acid.  For example, two [[mole (unit)|mole]]s of the base [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) can combine with one mole of sulfuric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to form two moles of [[water]] and one mole of sodium [[sulfate]].

:2NaOH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

=== The protonic (Brønsted-Lowry) definition ===

The Brønsted-Lowry definition, formulated independently by its two proponents [[Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted]] and [[Martin Lowry]] in [[1923]], revolves around an [[acid]]'s ability to donate [[proton (physics)|protons]] (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to another compound, called a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], in a chemical reaction. 

A base is a [[proton (physics)|proton]] acceptor. In Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reactions, there is a &quot;competition&quot; between two bases for a proton, so that if '''X''' and '''Y''' are two species, the equilibrium

:HX + Y&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;harr; HY + X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

occurs. Both HX and HY are Brønsted-Lowry acids; both X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and Y&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; are Brønsted-Lowry bases. If the reaction runs mostly to the left, then HY is the stronger acid and X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; the stronger base; if the reaction runs mostly to the right, then HX is the stronger acid and Y&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; the stronger base.

It may be more intuitive to define the stronger of two acids as the one which reacts more completely with a common base.  The following shows that this definition gives the same result.  Compare the reactions of the two acids HX and HY with the same base Z&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (in a mixture containing all these species):
:HX + Z&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;harr; HZ + X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
:HY + Z&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;harr; HZ + Y&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
If these reactions have equilibrium constants K&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, then:
:[X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;][HZ] / [HX][Z&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]=K&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;
:[Y&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;][HZ] / [HY][Z&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]=K&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;
and hence (dividing):
:[X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;][HY] / [HX][Y&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = K&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; / K&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt; 

Given that this last quantity is the equilibrium constant for the above reaction, the reaction will tend to the right if K&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1, in other words if HX is a stronger acid than HY under this definition, and ''vice versa''.

Acids and bases in the Brønsted-Lowry system occur in '''conjugate pairs'''; in the reaction 

:HX &amp;rarr;  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

'''HX''' is called the [[conjugate acid]] of the base '''X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;''', and '''X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'''  is called the [[conjugate base]] of the acid '''HX'''. 

Some compounds, like [[water]], can act either as an acid or a base, and are called amphoteric compounds.  

Stronger acids typically oxidize metals, forming salts and releasing hydrogen.

See [[pH]] for a measure of proton concentration frequently used for measuring acidity and alkalinity using this definition.  For a list of conjugate acid-base pairs, see [[conjugate acid]].

=== The solvent-system definition ===

This definition is based on a generalization of the earlier Arrhenius definition. If we consider a solvent which can be dissociated into a positive species '''X''' and a negative species '''Y''':

: XY &amp;harr; X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Y&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
or
: 2XY &amp;harr; X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Y&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; 
or
: 2XY &amp;harr; X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + XY&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; 

a compound causing an increase in  X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  (or X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and a decrease in Y&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (or XY&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) is an '''acid''' and one causing the reverse is a '''base'''. For example  in liquid [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[thionyl]] compounds (formally supplying SO&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) behave as acids, and [[sulfites]] (supplying SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) behave as bases.

In this more general sense, aprotic compounds (those which do not donate protons), can still react with bases, and the terms &quot;acid&quot; and &quot;base&quot; can still be used for reactions in aprotic or non-aqueous environments. 

=== The [[electron]]ic (Lewis) definition ===

The more general definition offered by [[Gilbert N. Lewis|Lewis]] in [[1923]] (the same year as the Brønsted-Lowry definition) describes the reactivity of an acid in terms of its ability to accept a pair of electrons from a base, defined as an electron-pair donor. In general, an acid reacts with a base by forming a new [[covalent bond]] utilizing an empty [[Electron configuration|orbital]] of the acid to share the extra electron pair of the base. Such a covalent bond, in which both of the shared electrons originate from one of the reacting molecules, is known as a [[coordinate covalent bond]].  From the perspective of Molecular Orbital theory, an acid-base reaction is the combination of [[HOMO]] from base and [[LUMO]] from acid to form a stable bonding [[molecular orbital]].

The Lewis definition is one of the most broad definitions and is necessary for an understanding of acid-base reactions, although the Brønsted-Lowry definition is sufficient and more practical for most cases in everyday use.

==Other acid-base theories==

=== The Usanovich definition ===

The most general definition is that of the Russian chemist Usanovich, and can basically be summarized as defining an acid as anything that accepts negative species or donates positive ones, and a base as the reverse. This tends to overlap the concept of [[redox]] ([[oxidation]]-[[reduction]]), and so is not highly favored by chemists. This is because redox reactions focus more on physical electron transfer processes, rather than bond making/bond breaking processes, although the distinction between these two processes is somewhat ambiguous.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''[[Abul-Faraj]] ([[1226]]-[[1286]]) was also a learned [[Armenia]]n [[Jew]], who became [[bishop]] of [[Aleppo]], and wrote a history of the world from [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] onwards.''

'''Abulfaraj''', also known as '''Abu-l-Faraj''' or '''`Ali ibn al-Husayn ul-Isbahani''', ([[897]]-[[967]]) was an [[Arab]] scholar, a member of the tribe of the [[Quraysh]] and a direct descendant of the last of the [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]]s, [[Marwan II]].

He was thus connected with the Umayyad rulers in [[Spain]], and seems to have kept up a correspondence with them and to have sent them some of his works. 

He was born in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], but spent his youth and made his early studies in [[Baghdad]].  He became famous for his knowledge of early Arabian antiquities.  

His later life was spent in various parts of the Islamic world, in [[Aleppo]] with its governor [[Hamdanid Dynasty|Sayf ad-Dawlah]] (to whom he dedicated the ''Book of Songs''), in [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] with the [[Buwayhid]] [[vizier]] [[Ibn 'Abbad]], and elsewhere. 

Although he wrote [[poetry]], also an anthology of verses on the [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Egypt]], and a genealogical work, his fame rests upon his ''Book of Songs'' (''Kitab al-Aghani''), which gives an account of the chief Arabian songs, ancient and modern, with the stories of the composers and singers. It contains a mass of information as to the life and customs of the early Arabs, and is the most valuable authority we have for their pre-Islamic and early Islamic days.

'''Alcobaça''' ([[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[IPA]] /{{IPA|aɫ.ku.'βa.sɐ}}/)  is in the district of [[Leiria]], in [[Portugal]] (though formerly included in the province of [[Estremadura]]), on the Alcoa and Baça rivers, from which it derives its name.  

Alcobaça grew along the valleys of the rivers Alcoa and Baça.

== Introduction ==

A town that only became notable in the [[12th century]] when it became the site for the important construction of [[Portugal| Portugal’s]] largest church. In the month of March in [[1147]] the fledgling King, Dom [[Afonso Henriques]], defeated the Moors by capturing the town of [[Santarém]]. As a suitable memory to this splendid victory he vowed to build a magnificent home for the [[Cistercian|Order of Cistercians]]. It took another 76 years before this task was completed. The [[monarchy]] continued to endow the [[Monastery]] with further construction and 60 years later King Dinis built the main cloister but it was only in [[1252]] that the [[Monastery]] was inaugurated within the [[church]]. In the [[church]] are the tombs of [[King Peter I]] and his murdered mistress Inês de Castro and with it the story of the tragic liaison between Pedro and his ever-lasting love for Inês. Forced at an early age by royal duty he had to marry Constanza, the Infanta of Castile. She died within a short time of the marriage ceremony and created the opportunity for Dom Pedro to escape with his true love and live in the city of Coimbra. King Afonso IV his father, believing that the family of Inês to be a threat to his own kingdom had her murdered. Shortly after the death of his father Dom Pedro declared that he had married Inês in a prior secret ceremony in Bragança, promptly taking revenge on the killers in a very gruesome manner and exhumed her body. He presented the embalmed corpse at court with a crown on her head and demanded that all his courtiers kneel and individually pay homage to her decomposed hand. Today, their ornate tombs face each other so that on the Judgment Day his first sight would be of his beloved Inês. During the following centuries the monks from this monastery had an influencing effect on Portuguese culture. Notably, in [[1269]] they were the first to give public lessons to their flock, and later they produced the authoritative history on Portugal in a series of books. In [[1810]] the invading French pillaged the Abbey taking with them most of the many treasures including a noteworthy library. Whatever the items remaining were then later stolen in [[1834]] during an anti-clerical riot and the extinction of religious Orders in Portugal.

== Description ==

The main feature of the town is essentially the Abbey that proudly presents a long and sombre façade with 18th Century embellishments. This austerity is further emphasized in the cloisters with its apt name of “Cloister of Silence”. In contrast within the Abbey is the massive kitchen with a running stream specially diverted to pass through as a supply of fresh water. The open area of the kitchen chimney is large enough to take a whole ox for roasting. The surround to the sacristy doorway is an outstanding example of Manueline decoration. In [[1794]], Lord Beckford visited the Abbey and commented that he found some 300 monks “living in a very splendid manner”!


== Nearby locations ==

A few kilometers to the north of Alcobaça is another wondrous building constructed in memory of a different important battle, that of Aljubarrota in [[1385]], when Dom João I defeated the Castilians and ensuring two hundred years of independence from the Spanish invaders. The construction of the Abbey at Batalha commenced in [[1388]] and was added to by various Portuguese Kings over these next two centuries. To the east of Batalha is the world famous location of Fátima and a point of pilgrimage for the Roman Catholic religion due to the vision of the Virgin Mary in [[1917]] by three young children whilst tending their flock. To the west of Alcobaça is the well-known fishing village of Nazaré. Today, the village is now a small town and a popular holiday resort with most of its past and traditions having rapidly evaporated in the course of time. A very successful Portuguese feature film was made in the early 20th Century that dramatically captured the primitive and dangerous life of these fishermen. Stoutly Catholic, the inhabitants have retained some of their past as can be still seen in their own particular style of costume. To the south is Caldas da Rainha and the quaint medieval town of Óbidos that is an attraction for any tourists that enjoys a true glimpse of the past. Also to the south is the town of Porto de Mós with its fanciful rebuilt castle. This town borders the Nature Reserve Parque Natural das Serras de Aire e Candeeiros. These 390 square kilometres of limestone-covered landscape is also known for its underground caverns. The most well known being the Grutas de Mira de Aire can be visited and consists of tunnels, caverns with stalactites, stalagmites, lakes, and a music and light finale.

      <comment>serpent --&gt; Serpent (symbolism). Disambiguation link repair ([[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|You can help!]])</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the mythological/legendary/heraldic creature.  See [[Amphisbaenia]] for information on the type of [[reptile]].''

'''Amphisbaena''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]]: {{IPA|ˌæmf&amp;#618;sˈbin&amp;#601;}}, plural: amphisbaenae), or '''Amphisbaina''', or '''Amphisbene''', or '''Amphisboena''', or '''Amphisbona''', or '''Amphista''', or '''Amphivena''', or '''Anphivena''' (the last two being feminine), a [[Greek language|Greek]] word, from ''amfis'', meaning both ways, and ''bainein'', meaning to go, also called the Mother of Ants, is a [[mythological]], ant-eating [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] with a head at each end. According to [[Greek mythology]], the mythological amphisbaena was spawned from the blood that dripped from [[Medusa]] the [[Gorgon]]'s head as [[Perseus]] flew over the Libyan desert with it in his hand. Cato's army then encountered it along with other serpents on the march. Amphisbaenae fed off of the corpses left behind. The amphisbaena has been referred to by the [[poet]]s, such as [[Nicander]], [[John Milton]], [[Alexander Pope]], and [[Alfred Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] and the amphisbaena as a mythological and legendary creature has been referenced by [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Isidore of Seville]], and [[Thomas Browne|Browne, Sir Thomas]], the last of which debunked its existence. 

== Appearance ==

The earlier descriptions of the amphisbaena depict what looks basically like a snake (perhaps an [[Indian Sand Boa]]), but with a head at either end. However, medieval and later drawings often show it with two or more scaled feet, particularly chicken feet and feathered wings. Some even depict it with horns on the front head and small, round ears on the other, or horns on  both heads. These horns are long and either curved upwards or slightly spiraled. Also, some show it with the second head on the end of its tail, while others have both &quot;necks&quot; of equal size so that it cannot be determined which is the rear head. Many descriptions of the amphisbaena say its eyes glow like candles or lightning, but the poet [[Nicander]] seems to contradict this by describing it as &quot;always dull of eye&quot;. He also says: &quot;From either end protrudes a blunt chin; each is far from each other.&quot;

== Abilities ==

* regenerative abilities - if the amphisbaena is cut in half, the two parts can rejoin
* venomous fangs - the amphisbaena is venomous, as [[Pliny the Elder ]] indicates: &quot;The amphisbaena has a twin head, that is one at the tail end as well, as though it were not enough for poison to be poured out of one mouth.&quot;
* efficient duplicity - the amphisbaena's heads can handle more than one task at once, as [[Thomas Browne|Browne, Sir Thomas]] explains: &quot;...while one wept, the other laughing; while one was silent, the other speaking; while one awaked, the other sleeping; as is declared by three remarkable examples in Petrarch, Vincentius, and the Scottish History of Buchanan.&quot;
* speed - according to some accounts, the amphisbaena can slither (or run) very quickly, and, in the case of the limbless amphisbaena, it can slither in either direction, as [[Isidore of Seville]] indicates: &quot;It can move in the direction of either head with a circular motion.&quot; The poet [[Nicander]], however, describes the amphisbaena as &quot;slow in motion&quot;.
* rolling - by locking the jaws of its two heads or holding the neck of one in the mouth of the other, the amphisbaena can roll like a hoop, as depicted by medieval artists
* warmbloodedness - unlike most serpents, the amphisbaena was apparently unperturbed by the cold, as [[Isidore of Seville]] indicates: &quot;Alone among snakes, the amphisbaena goes out in the cold.&quot;

== Uses ==

* pregnancy - pregnant women wearing an amphisbaena around their necks would supposedly have safe pregnancies; in accord with this, women in power would wear bracelets in the shape of amphisbaenae
* [[arthritis]] - wearing a dead amphisbaena or its skin would cure [[arthritis]]
* chilblains - wearing the skin of an amphisbaena will reduce this swelling of the hands caused by cold
* cold - wearing a dead amphisbaena or its skin is a cure for a cold
* woodcutting - nailing the skin of an amphisbeana to a tree before cutting it down will make it easier to fell the tree and keep the lumberjack warm

== References in [[heraldry]] ==

As well as a legendary creature referenced by ancient historians and a monster from [[Greek mythology]], the amphisbaena is a heraldic creature.

'''Amphibanes''', or '''Amphibenes''' is a heraldic term indicating the crest: &quot;on a  Saltire ''or'', interlaced by two Amphisbaenae ''azure'' [[tongue|langued]] ''gules'' a rose of the last barbed and seeded ''purpure''&quot;. This was the crest of [[Gwilt]].

In plain [[English language|English]], this means a rose with purple thorns and seeds interlaced by two blue, red-tongued amphisbaenae, with a yellow X in the background.

Three of these alcohols, active amyl alcohol, methyl (n) propyl carbinol, and methyl isopropyl carbinol, contain an asymmetric carbon atom and can consequently each exist in two [[optical isomerism|optically active]], and one optically inactive form.

The most important is isobutyl carbinol, this being the chief constituent of fermentation amyl alcohol, and consequently a constituent of [[fusel oil]].  It may be separated from fusel oil by shaking with strong [[brine]] solution, separating the oily layer from the brine layer and [[distillation|distilling]] it, the portion boiling between 125 &amp;deg;C and 140 &amp;deg;C. being collected.  For further purification it may be shaken with hot [[lime water]], the oily layer separated, dried with [[calcium chloride]] and fractionated, the fraction boiling between 128 &amp;deg;C and 132 &amp;deg;C only being collected.  It may be synthetically prepared from [[butanol|isobutyl alcohol]] by conversion into isovaleraldehyde, which is subsequently reduced to isobutyl carbinol by means of [[sodium amalgam]].

It is a colourless liquid of density 0.8247 g/cm&amp;sup3; (0 &amp;deg;C), boiling at 131.6 &amp;deg;C, slightly soluble in water, easily soluble in [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[diethyl ether|ether]], [[chloroform]] and [[benzene]].  It possesses a characteristic strong smell and a sharp burning taste.  When perfectly pure, it is not a poison, although the impure product is.  On passing its vapour through a red-hot tube, it undergoes decomposition with production of [[acetylene]], [[ethylene]], [[propylene]], etc. It is [[oxidation|oxidized]] by [[chromic acid]] mixture to isovaleraldehyde; and it forms crystalline addition compounds with [[calcium chloride]] and [[tin(IV) chloride]].

The other amyl alcohols may be obtained synthetically.  Of these, tertiary butyl carbinol has been the most difficult to obtain, its synthesis having first been accomplished in [[1891]], by L. Tissier (''Comptes Rendus'', 1891, 112, p. 1065) by the reduction of a mixture of trimethyl acetic acid and trimethylacetyl chloride with sodium amalgam.  It is a solid which melts at 48 to 50 &amp;deg;C and boils at 112.3 &amp;deg;C.

The [[chemical compound]] '''amyl nitrite''' (here referring to '''isoamyl nitrite''') is an [[Alkyl nitrites|alkyl nitrite]].
It has a characteristic penetrating odour, and produces marked effects on the human body when its vapour is inhaled. It acts as a [[vasodilator]] (expanding [[blood vessel]]s and thus lowering [[blood pressure]]) and finds applications in [[medicine]] in the treatment of [[ischaemic heart disease|heart disease]] such as [[angina]]. Amyl nitrite is also used to treat [[cyanide]] poisoning. It induces the formation [[methemoglobin]] which binds cyanide into non-toxic cyanomethemoglobin.
When used recreationally, doses of it are often called '''poppers'''. See the article ''[[alkyl nitrites]]'' for more information on its recreational use as an inhalant. The effects of amyl nitrite are thought to be due to the action of [[nitric oxide]] in the body.

Physical effects include headache, flushing of the face, decrease in blood pressure, increase in pulse, dizziness and relaxation of [[involuntary muscle]]s, especially the [[blood vessel]] walls and the [[anal sphincter]]. There are no [[withdrawal]] symptoms. [[Overdose]] symptoms include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], badly decreased [[blood pressure]] and [[Breath|respiration]], fainting, cold skin and possible circulatory collapse and death.

'''Nitramyl''' is another name for isoamyl nitrite. The name &quot;amyl nitrite&quot; is actually ambiguous as it can refer not only to 3-methyl-1-nitrosooxybutane, but also its isomers 2-methyl-1-nitrosooxybutane, 3-nitrosooxypentane, 2-nitrosooxypentane, and most commonly 1-nitrosooxypentane - '''n-amyl nitrite'''. Other synonyms for amyl nitrite, which may refer to any isomer, include '''Pentyl Alcohol Nitrite''' and '''Nitrous acid, pentyl ester'''. The name &quot;[[amyl nitrate]]&quot; is commonly mistaken for amyl nitrite; they are two different chemicals.

==Chemistry==

Isoamyl nitrite is a clear liquid of [[specific gravity]] 0.872, boiling at about 95 to 96 degrees [[Celsius]].
It has a [[solubility]] in [[water (molecule)|water]] of about .01 g/100 mL, but dissolves readily in [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[diethyl ether|ether]], glacial [[acetic acid]], [[chloroform]], and [[benzene]].
It is prepared by passing nitrous fumes (from [[starch]] and concentrated [[nitric acid]]) into warm [[isoamyl alcohol]], or by distilling a mixture of 26 parts of [[potassium nitrite]] in 15 parts of water with 30 parts of isoamyl alcohol in 30 parts of [[sulfuric acid]].
On heating with [[methanol]], it is converted into isoamyl alcohol and [[methyl nitrite]]; a similar reaction takes place with [[ethanol]], but the change is less complete.
It is readily decomposed by [[nascent hydrogen]], with the formation of [[ammonia]] and isoamyl alcohol; and in alkaline [[hydrolysis]] it forms isoamyl alcohol.

n-amyl nitrite is a yellow-coloured liquid of specific gravity 0.853, boiling at 104 degrees Celsius. It decomposes in water. When the liquid is dropped onto fused [[potassium hydroxide|caustic potash]] (liquid KOH), it forms [[potassium valerate]].

{{redirect|Fall}}

'''Autumn''' (also '''fall''' in [[North American English]]) is one of the four temperate [[seasons]], the transition from [[summer]] into [[winter]].

In the [[temperate zone]]s, autumn is the season during which most crops are [[harvest]]ed, and [[deciduous]] trees lose their [[leaf|leaves]]. It is also the season in rapidly get shorter and cooler (especially in the northern latitudes), and of gradually increasing precipitation in some parts of the world. 

Astronomically, it begins with the [[autumnal equinox]] (around [[September 23]] in the [[Northern hemisphere]], and [[March 21]] in the [[southern hemisphere]]), and ends with the [[winter solstice]] (around [[December 21]] in the Northern hemisphere and [[June 21]] in the Southern hemisphere). However, meteorologists count the entire months of March, April and May in the Southern hemisphere, and September, October and November in the Northern hemisphere as autumn. An exception to these definitions is found in the [[Irish Calendar]] which still follows the Celtic cycle, where Autumn is counted as the whole months of [[August]], [[September]] and [[October]]. 

Although the days begin to shorten in July or August in the northern latitudes and in January and February in the south, it is usually in September or March where twilight becomes evidently shorter and more abrupt in comparison with the more lingering ones of summer.

[[image:autumn.westonbirt.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|Autumn colours at [[Westonbirt Arboretum]], Gloucestershire, England.]]

Autumn is often defined as the start of the school year in most countries, since they usually begin in early September or early March (depending on the latitude).

Either definition, as with those of the seasons generally, is flawed because it assumes that the seasons are all of the same length, and begin and end at the same time throughout the temperate zone of each hemisphere.

==Historic usage and recognition==
Diverse nations computed the years by autumns, while the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s did so by [[winter]]s. [[Tacitus]] tells us that the ancient Germans were acquainted with all the other seasons of the year, but had no notion of Autumn. Linwood observed of the beginning of the several seasons of the year, that
:&quot;Dat Clemens Hyemem, dat Petrus Ver Cathedratus;
:Aestuat Urbanus, Autumnat Bartholomaeus.&quot; {{ref label|1728|1|^}}

In [[alchemy]], Autumn is the time or season when the operation of the [[Philosopher's stone]] is brought to maturity and perfection. {{ref label|1728|1|^}}

==Autumn in popular culture==
[[Image:autumn.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Personification]] of Autumn (Currier &amp; Ives Lithograph, 1871).]]

Autumn's association with the transition from warm to cold weather in the northern hemisphere, and its related status as the season of the primary [[harvest]], has dominated its themes and popular images. In Western cultures, personifications of Autumn are usually pretty, well-fed females decked out with fruits, vegetables and grains that ripen at this time. Most ancient cultures featured autumnal celebrations of the harvest, often the most important on their calendars. Still extant echoes of these celebrations are found in the late-Autumn [[Thanksgiving]] holiday of the [[United States]], the Jewish [[Sukkot]] holiday with its roots as a full moon harvest festival of &quot;tabernacles&quot; (huts wherein the harvest was processed and which later gained religious significance), the many North American Indian festivals tied to harvest of autumnally ripe foods gathered in the wild, the Chinese [[Mid-Autumn Festival | Mid-Autumn or Moon festival]], and many others. The predominant mood of these autumnal celebrations is a gladness for the fruits of the earth mixed with a certain melancholy linked to the imminence of harsh weather. Remembrance of ancestors is also a common theme.

In modern times, apart from being the start of the school year, it is one of the seasons in which the film industry starts releasing movies that are usually low-budget in scope, but worthy of artistic achievement at academic institutions such as the [[Oscars]] and the [[BAFTA]] awards (whose award ceremonies are held in late-February). Such movies are considered low-key, deeper in content and more serious than their big-budget, effects-laden summer counterparts. Autumn, which begins on the weekend following [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]] and ends—every 4 years—on the weekend before the US elections, is the shortest and least profitable season of the movies.

Autumn is also associated with the [[Halloween]] season, and with it a widespread marketing campaign that promotes it. The film and music industries use this time of year to promote movies and records that closely associate with such holiday, and their releases begin in early September but no later than October 28, since their themes rapidly lose strength once the holidays ends.

Autumn, like spring, is highly unpredictable and, in many regions, it is also short.  Temperatures in September can get above 86°F (30°C) and with the heat index, it may make for dangerous conditions regarding people neglecting themselves in regard to heat stroke ([[hyperthermia]]) risks. In October, especially in the northern lattitudes, there maybe some cold snaps and a mix of rain and snow, although permanent snow cover is usually not established until mid-November.

== Autumn and tourism ==
[[Image:Autumn colors.jpg|thumb|right|Brilliant orange of sunlight autumn trees]]

Eastern Canada and the [[New England]] region of the United States are famous around the world for the brilliance of their &quot;fall foliage,&quot; and a seasonal tourist industry has grown up around the few weeks in autumn when the leaves are at their peak. Some television and web-based weather forecasts even report on the status of the fall foliage throughout the season as a service to tourists. Fall foliage tourists are often referred to as &quot;[[leaf peeper]]s&quot;.

== Autumn versus Fall ==
[[Image:FireTrees-Fall2005-Georgia.jpg|thumb|right|Fiery red fall leaves]]
'''Fall''' is an alternative [[English language|English]] word for the season of [[Autumn]]. Only in use now in [[North American English]], the word traces it origins to old [[Germanic languages]]. The exact derivation is unclear, the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''fiæll'' or ''feallan'' and the [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''fall'' all being possible candidates. However, these words all have the meaning &quot;to fall from a height&quot; and are clearly derived either from a common root or from each other. The term only came to denote the season in the [[16th century]], a contraction of [[Middle English]] expressions like &quot;fall of the leaf&quot; and &quot;fall of the year&quot;.

''Autumn'' comes from the [[Old French]] ''autompne'', and ultimately from the [[Latin]] autumnus. There are rare examples of its use as early as the [[14th century]], but it became common only in the 16th, around the same time as ''Fall'', when the two words appear to have been used interchangebly. 

During the 17th century immigration to the English colonies in [[North America]] was at its peak and the new settlers took their language with them. While use of the term ''Fall'' gradually waned in Britain, the opposite happened in North America, and ''Autumn'' fell from favour.

Before the 16th century ''[[Harvest]]'' was the term usually used to refer to the season. However as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns (especially those who could read and write, the only people whose use of language we now know), the 
word became to refer to the actual activity of reaping, rather than the time of year, and ''Fall'' and ''Autumn'' began to replace it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Angus McDuck''', nicknamed &quot;Pothole&quot;, is a [[fictional character]] of the [[Scrooge McDuck universe]], as depicted in [[comic book]]s series produced by the [[Walt Disney]] company. 

Angus McDuck was born in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] on [[1829]] to [[Dingus McDuck]] and [[Molly Mallard]], who were both working as [[coal]] miners at the time. He had two younger brothers named [[Fergus McDuck]] and [[Jake McDuck]].

Angus migrated to the [[United States]] during the late [[1840s]]. In [[1850]] he was working as a cabin boy in the [[Mississippi River]] riverboat ''Drennan Whyte'' when it sunk. He was the only survivor. He continued working on Mississippi riverboats and he had obtained his own by [[1861]], named ''Cotton Queen''. During the [[American Civil War]] ([[1861]]-[[1865]]) he became quite successful as a riverboater.  Soon after the end of the war in [[1865]] he and fellow riverboater [[Porker Hogg]] became the two owners of Cornpone Gables, a southern [[plantation]] that had gone bankrupt. The two were unable to settle their differences and they decided to have a riverboat race in [[1870]] to decide who would be the single owner. Both riverboats sunk.  Porker had two more riverboats but Angus spent the next ten years as a professional card player.

In [[1880]], in a poker game with Porker, Angus won the rights to one of his rival's riverboats, named ''Dilly Dollar''.  Porker soon lost his other riverboat to the Beagle Boys, a family of outlaws, and retired. Angus on the other hand hired his nephew [[Scrooge McDuck]] and a penniless inventor named [[Ratchet Gearloose]] as his crew. Business wasn't going well and Angus decided to retire in [[1882]]. He left his riverboat to his nephew and settled down in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].

He became the writer of a series of [[dime novel]]s under the title ''The Master of Mississippi'', based on a highly exaggerated description of his life. His dime novels became very popular and to have more material to add he occasionally travelled through the country.

During his travels he met many famous historical figures of the Western United States. Among others he befriended [[Phineas Taylor Barnum]], [[Buffalo Bill]], [[Annie Oakley]], and [[Geronimo]].

He died in 1901 aged 72.

'''Alameda''' is a city located in [[Alameda County, California]].  It is a city on a small island of the same name next to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]] in the [[San Francisco Bay]]. An additional part of the city is on ''Bay Farm Island'', which it shares with the [[Oakland International Airport]].  The city has a small town feel with its Victorian homes and tree lined neighborhoods. As of the 2000 census, the city had a total population of 72,259. 

Today the city consists of the main original section, with the former [[Naval Air Station Alameda|Naval Air Station]] at one end, and [[Bay Farm Island]], which is actually part of the mainland proper. Both of these are built on artificial hydraulic landfill on top of the bay's muddy bottom.  The area of the former NAS is now known as &quot;Alameda Point.&quot;

== History ==

The city was founded on June 6, 1853.  Alameda was not originally on an island; rather, it was a peninsula off Oakland. The need for expanded shipping facilities in the late 19th century in both cities led to a shipping and tidal channel that was dug between the two cities in 1902, extending and deepening the natural estuary, which resulted in Alameda becoming an &quot;island&quot; with most of the dug up soil used to fill in some sections of the nearby marsh land.

== Geography ==
[[Image:CAMap-doton-Alameda.png|right|Location of Alameda, California]]Alameda is located at 37&amp;deg;45'50&quot; North, 122&amp;deg;15'25&quot; West (37.763971, -122.256810){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 59.5 [[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]] (23.0 [[square mile|mi&amp;sup2;]]).  28.0 km&amp;sup2; (10.8 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is land and 31.5 km&amp;sup2; (12.2 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is water.  The total area is 52.98% water.

== Demographics ==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there are 72,259 people, 30,226 households, and 17,863 families residing in the city.  The [[population density]] is 2,583.3/km&amp;sup2; (6,693.4/mi&amp;sup2;).  There are 31,644 housing units at an average density of 1,131.3/km&amp;sup2; (2,931.2/mi&amp;sup2;).  The racial makeup of the city is 56.95% [[Race (U.S. census)|White]], 6.21% [[Race (U.S. census)|Black]] or [[Race (U.S. census)|African American]], 0.67% [[Race (U.S. census)|Native American]], 26.15% [[Race (U.S. census)|Asian]], 0.60% [[Race (U.S. census)|Pacific Islander]], 3.29% from [[race (U.S. census)|other races]], and 6.13% from two or more races.  9.31% of the population are [[Race (U.S. census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (U.S. census)|Latino]] of any race.

There are 30,226 households out of which 27.7% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.7% are [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 11.4% have a female householder with no husband present, and 40.9% are non-families. 32.2% of all households are made up of individuals and 9.4% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older.  The average household size is 2.35 and the average family size is 3.04.

In the city the population is spread out with 21.5% under the age of 18, 7.0% from 18 to 24, 33.6% from 25 to 44, 24.6% from 45 to 64, and 13.3% who are 65 years of age or older.  The median age is 38 years.  For every 100 females there are 92.3 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 89.5 males.

The median income for a household in the city is $56,285, and the median income for a family is $68,625. Males have a median income of $49,174 versus $40,165 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city is $30,982.  8.2% of the population and 6.0% of families are below the [[poverty line]].  Out of the total population, 11.4% of those under the age of 18 and 6.1% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.

== Transportation ==

Vehicle access to the island is via three bridges to Oakland, a bridge to Bay Farm Island, and two one-way tunnels leading into Oakland's Chinatown.  Bridges at Fruitvale Avenue, High Street, and Park Street, and the tunnels at Webster Street and Harrison Street (the latter called the &quot;Posey tube&quot;) connect Alameda and Oakland. Public transportation includes the [[AC Transit]] buses (which include express buses to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]) and two ferry services--the [[Alameda-Oakland Ferry]] and the [[Harbor Bay Ferry]].  The island is also close to the [[BART]] train service.

Even though the island is just minutes off [[Interstate 880]], the speed limit for the city is 25 mph (40 km/h) on almost every road.  Many unaware drivers fail to slow down after exiting the highway.  Groups like Pedestrian Friendly Alameda and BikeAlameda advocate stronger enforcement of speeding laws.

== Attractions ==

Due to its proximity to the Bay, [[windsurfing|wind surfer]]s and [[kite surfing|kite surfer]]s can often be seen along Crown Memorial State Beach and Shoreline Drive. From the beach there are also have views of the [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] skyline and the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]].

One of the recent attractions is the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|USS ''Hornet'']], a [[museum ship]] now moored at the former [[Naval Air Station Alameda|Naval Air Station]]. 

== Economic development ==
[[Image:Afl_new.jpg|frame|The New Alameda Free Library]][[Image:Alameda_Theater.jpg|frame|The Alameda Theater as of February 2006]] The Naval Air Station Alameda was decomissioned and is in process of being turned over to the City of Alameda for civilian development. The area of the former NAS is now known as &quot;Alameda Point&quot;. Portions of Alameda Point are now in commercial use, but the transfer process has been slowed down by disputes between the Navy and the City regarding payment for environmental cleanup of the land.  Development of the base is also opposed by a vocal minority in the City who object to modifications to a ballot measure passed in the 1970's that intended to stop a practice then popular in the City of tearing down the island's beautiful, historical Victorian homes and replacing them with apartment complexes.

After two previous failures, voters in the City passed a ballot measure in [[2000]] authorizing a bond measure for construction of a new library to replace the city's [[Carnegie library]] that was damaged during the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]].  The City also received state funds for the new library and it is currently under construction near the City's Park Street business district and will open in the fall of 2006.  

City officials continue to seek ways to spur economic development on the Island including the reconstruction of the City's shopping mall and restoration of the historic art deco city landmark Alameda Theater.  The theater restoration project is currently the subject of much controversy in the City, pitting the City's pro-development and anti-development factions against each other once again.

==Alameda Power and Telecom==
Unlike surrounding communities, Alameda has a municipal power and telecommunications service (Alameda Power and Telecom) that delivers services directly to consumers. The telecommunications service has the potential of far exceeding the capabilities of the various cable and DSL providers in the larger region.

There have been proposals by the power producer to produce energy from waste, but not within the city of Alameda. Instead this energy would be produced at a waste transfer station located  in neighboring (and downwind) [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]]. Owing to the expected release of toxic emissions from what is essentially a [[Waste|garbage]] [[incinerator]], the mayor and city council of San Leandro rejected the proposal. The mayor vowed to fight this proposal, suggesting that Alameda could instead place this near their municipal golf course.

Also, unlike the three major power producers in California, Alameda is not required to establish [[net metering]] for home [[photovoltaic]] power producers, so the city currently lags far behind other communities in producing truly &quot;green&quot; energy, even though they have a potentially productive site for supplemental wind energy on the western edge of the former naval air station.

==Arts and Culture==

The [[Alameda Arts Council]] (AAC) is the Alameda City [[arts council]] serving the arts in the Alameda area.

===&quot;Art In the Park&quot;===
[[Art In the Park]] is an annual event that takes place in [[Jackson Park]] (Encinal and Park Ave) which the [[Alameda Arts Council]] co-produces with [[Alameda Recreation &amp; Parks]]. This event is held each September and features over 100 local artists, two music areas, a children's activity area, food, poetry readings and art demonstrations. This event is free to the public.

===&quot;Shining Stars In The Arts&quot;===
[[Shining Stars In The Arts]] is an evening event that celebrates the community members in Alameda who have made an outstanding contribution in the Arts in the city. Features a fundraising silent art auction, food and music concludes in an award ceremony for the Shining Star Honorees. Held in May.

== Miscellaneous ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''cholinesterase inhibitor''' or '''anticholinesterase''' is a [[chemical compound|chemical]] that inhibits a [[cholinesterase]] [[enzyme]] from breaking down [[acetylcholine]], so increasing both the level and duration of action of the [[neurotransmitter]] acetylcholine.

Anticholinesterases occur naturally as [[venom (poison)|venoms]] and [[poison]]s, are used as weapons in the form of [[nerve agent]]s, and are used medicinally to treat diseases such as [[myasthenia gravis]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]], and as an antidote to [[anticholinergic]] poisoning. In myasthenia gravis, they are used to increase neuromuscular transmission.

Compounds which function as [[reversible inhibitor|reversible]] [[competitive inhibitor|competitive]] or [[noncompetitive inhibitor]]s of cholinesterase are those most likely to have therapeutic uses. These include:
*[[Organophosphate]]s
**[[metrifonate]]
*[[Carbamate]]s
**[[physostigmine]]
**[[neostigmine]]
**[[pyridostigmine]]
**[[ambenonium]]
**[[demarcarium]]
**[[rivastigmine]]
*[[Phenanthrine]] derivatives
**[[galantamine]]
*[[Piperidine]]s
**[[donepezil]], also known as ''E2020''
*[[Tacrine]], also known as tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA')
*[[Edrophonium]]

Compounds which function as [[quasi-irreversible inhibitor]]s of cholinesterase are those most likely to have use as [[chemical weapon]]s or [[pesticide]]s. These include:
*[[Organophosphate]]s
**[[echothiophate]]
**[[isoflurophate]]
**[[diisopropyl fluorophosphate]]
**[[cyclosarin]]
**[[sarin]]
**[[soman]]
**[[tabun (nerve gas)|tabun]]
**[[VX]]
**[[VE (nerve agent)|VE]]
**[[VG (nerve agent)|VG]]
**[[VM (nerve agent)|VM]]
**[[diazinon]]
**[[malathion]]
**[[parathion]]
*[[Carbamate]]s
**[[aldicarb]]
**[[bendiocarb]]
**[[bufencarb]]
**[[carbaryl]]
**[[carbendazim]]
**[[carbetamide]]
**[[carbofuran]]
**[[chlorbufam]]
**[[chloropropham]]
**[[ethiofencarb]]
**[[formetanate]]
**[[methiocarb]]
**[[methomyl]]
**[[oxamyl]]
**[[phenmedipham]]
**[[pinmicarb]]
**[[pirimicarb]]
**[[propamocarb]]
**[[propham]]
**[[propoxur]]

Some major effects of anticholinesterase:

Actions on the autonomic nervous system, that is parasympathetic nervous system will cause bradycardia, hypotension, hypersecretion, bronchoconstriction, GIT hypermotility, and decrease intraocular pressure.

Actions on the neuromuscular junction will result in prolonged muscle contraction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AlphaHelixProtein.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A diagram of the alpha helix structure of amino acids]]
In [[protein]]s, the '''&amp;alpha; helix''' is a major structural motif in [[secondary structure]]. It was first postulated by [[Linus Pauling]], [[Robert Corey]], and [[Herman Branson]] in [[1951]] based on the known [[crystallography|crystal structures]] of [[amino acid]]s and [[peptide]]s and Pauling's prediction of planar [[peptide bond]]s.  

The experimental work to provide the basic dimensions of the helix had been done by [[William Astbury]] on [[keratin]] using [[X-ray diffraction]] in 1937.  However the correct interpretation of the data was difficult and Pauling puzzled over it for years.  It was not until January 1948, while in [[Oxford]], that Pauling caught a cold and went to bed.  After a while he became bored and drew the chain on a strip of paper and folded it into a helix. After a few attempts at folding, he eventually produced the model which had the hydrogen bonds in the correct places. Pauling then worked with Corey and Branson to confirm his idea before publication.

The amino acids in an &amp;alpha; helix are arranged in a [[helix|helical]] structure, 5.4 [[Angstrom]]s or .54 nano[[metre]]s wide. Each amino acid results in a 100° turn in the helix, and corresponds to a translation of 0.15 nanometres along the helical axis. The helix is tightly packed; there is almost no free space within the helix. All amino acid side-chains are arranged at the outside of the helix. The [[amine|N-H]] group of amino acid (n+4) can establish a [[hydrogen bond]] with the [[carbonyl|C=O]] group of amino acid (n).

Short [[polypeptide]]s usually are not able to adopt the alpha helical structure, since the [[entropy|entropic]] cost associated with the folding of the polypeptide chain is too high. Some amino acids (called ''helix breakers'') like [[proline]] and [[glycine]] will disrupt the helical structure. 

Ordinarily, a helix has an overall [[dipole moment]] caused by the aggregate effect of all the individual dipoles from the [[carbonyl]] groups of the peptide bond pointing along the helix axis. This can lead to destabilization of the helix through entropic effects. As a result, &amp;alpha; helices are often capped at the N-terminal end by a negatively charged [[amino acid]] (like [[glutamic acid]]) in order to neutralize this helix dipole. Less common (and less effective) is C-terminal capping with a positively charged amino acid like [[lysine]].

&amp;alpha; helices have particular significance in [[DNA]] binding motifs, including [[helix-turn-helix]] motifs, [[leucine zipper]] motifs and [[zinc finger]] motifs. This is because of a structural coincidence: The diameter of the &amp;alpha; helix is 1.2 nano[[metre]]s, the same as the width of the major groove in B-form [[DNA]].

&amp;alpha; helices are one of the basic structural elements in proteins, together with [[beta sheet]]s.

The peptide backbone of an &amp;alpha; helix has 3.6 amino acids per turn.

[[image:arms-accrington.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Arms of Accrington Borough Council]]
'''Accrington''', in the County of [[Lancashire]], is a small former [[mill]] town in the industrial north-west of [[England]]. Its name is thought to be a corruption of 'acorn-ring-town', although the old oak woods that once encircled the town have long-since gone, victims of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Since the redrawing of the political boundaries in [[1974]], the town has formed part of the Borough of [[Hyndburn]] &amp;mdash; a merging of Accrington together with the smaller 'satellite' towns of [[Oswaldtwistle]], [[Church (Lancashire)|Church]], [[Clayton-le-Moors]], [[Great Harwood]] and [[Rishton]], into one political 'seat'. 

The 2001 census gave the population of Accrington town proper as 35,203. The figure for the built-up area (&quot;Accrington Urban Area&quot;) was 71,224, up 1.1% from 70,442 in 1991. For comparison purposes that is approximately the same size as Aylesbury, Carlisle, Guildford or Scunthorpe urban areas.

The town is linked to [[Burnley]] and [[Blackburn]] by railway and by the [[M65 motorway|M65]] motorway. There was once a rail link south to [[Manchester]] via [[Haslingden]] and [[Bury]], but this was closed in the 1960s as part of cuts following the [[Beeching Report]]. The trackbed is now mostly covered by the A56 dual carriageway, which provides a link to the [[M66 motorway|M66]].

There is a sizeable shopping area and precinct in Accrington, with a selection of major chain stores such as [[Marks and Spencer]] and [[Boots the Chemist|Boots]]. 
 
For many decades, the textile industry was the central activity of the town. [[Mill]]s and [[dye]] works provided work for the inhabitants, but often in very difficult conditions. There was regular conflict with employers, most famously in the 1842 'Plug riots' where a general strike spread from town to town, as thousands of strikers walked over the hills from one town to another to persuade people to join the strike. The strike joined up with the chartist movement, but was not successful in its aims.

== Tiffany Glass ==

The Haworth Art Gallery in Accrington contains an outstanding  collection of Tiffany glassware presented to the town by Joseph Briggs, an Accrington man who had joined Tiffany’s in the late 19th century and eventually became art director and assistant manager. The Art Nouveau vases are considered to be the most important such group in Europe. One of the most striking items is a glass mosaic exhibition piece, designed by Briggs himself and entitled Sulphur Crested Cockatoos. 


== The Accrington Pals ==

One well-known association the town has is with the '[[Accrington Pals]]', the nickname given to the smallest home town [[battalion]] of volunteers formed to fight in [[World War I]]. The [[Pals battalion]]s were a peculiarity of the 1914-1918 war: [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]], the [[Secretary of State for War]], believed that it would help recruitment if friends and work-mates from the same town were able to join up and fight together. Strictly speaking, the 'Accrington Pals' battalion is properly known as the '11th East Lancashire Regiment': the nickname is a little misleading, since of the four 250-strong companies that made up the original battalion only one was actually composed of men from Accrington. The rest volunteered from other East Lancs towns such as [[Burnley]], [[Blackburn]], and [[Chorley]]. 

The Pals' first day of combat, Saturday 1st July 1916, took place in Serre in the north of [[France]]. It was part of the 'Big Push' (later known as the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]]) that was intended to force the German army into a retreat from the [[Western front|Western Front]], a line they had held since late 1914. The German defences in Serre were supposed to have been obliterated by sustained, heavy, British shelling during the preceding week; however, as the battalion advanced it met with fierce resistance. 235 men were killed, and a further 350 wounded &amp;mdash; more than half of the battalion &amp;mdash; within half an hour. Similarly desperate losses were suffered elsewhere on the front, in a disastrous day for the British army. 

Later in the year, the East Lancs Regiment was rebuilt with new volunteers &amp;mdash; in all, 865 Accrington men were killed during World War I. All of these names are recorded on a war memorial, an imposing white stone cenotaph, which stands in Oak Hill Park in the south of the town. The [[cenotaph]] also lists the names of 173 local fatalities from [[World War II]].

== Accrington's football teams ==

The town's other famous association is with [[Accrington Stanley F.C.]], the butt of many (largely affectionate) jokes. The team's name is often invoked as a symbol of British sport's legion of plucky but hopeless causes (much like British ski-jumping's 'heroic failure' [[Eddie 'the Eagle' Edwards]]). The club entered the [[The Football League|Football League]] in 1921 with the formation of the old Third Division (North); after haunting the lower reaches of English football for forty years, they eventually went into enforced liquidation and were ignominiously ejected from the League in 1962. The club was reformed in 1968 and currently plays in the 'non-league' [[Nationwide Conference]] divisions.

An earlier club, [[Accrington F.C.]], were one of the twelve founder members of the Football League in 1888. However, their time in league football was even less successful, and considerably briefer, than that of Accrington Stanley: they dropped out of the league in 1893, and folded shortly afterwards due to financial problems. The town of Accrington thus has the unique 'distinction' of having lost two separate clubs from league football, over the years.

== Famous sons and daughters ==

Accrington's famous sons and daughters include: [[Jon Anderson]] of rock band [[Yes (band)|Yes]]; author [[Jeanette Winterson]], whose ''[[Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit]]'' is an account of her childhood in the town; and composer [[Harrison Birtwistle]].

[[David Jones]] of the [[Monkees]] music group was also a native.

Famous ex-residents include darts player Ronny Baxter and the National Lottery's [[Mystic Meg]]!

They live in [[Duckburg]], [[Calisota]], along with their aunt and act as their cousins' [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] Duck female counterparts, occasional rivals, occasional friends, and occasional dates. They are members of the organization [[The Junior Chickadees]], who serve as [[The Junior Woodchucks]]' female counterparts.

April, May, and June were not seen in animation until they were given a special cameo on the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode &quot;Ladies' Night&quot;.

The names were also used in a [[Three Stooges]] short for three sisters the protagonists end up marrying.

{{Wiktionarypar|Armageddon}}

'''Armageddon''' refers generally to [[end times]] or giant catastrophes in various religions and cultures.  It may also refer to any great loss of life in battle or use of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. The word ''armageddon'' is derived from Mount [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]] (''Har Megido'' ''הר מגידו'' in Hebrew) , the site of the [[Battle of Megiddo]] and other battles. Some would argue the word is an early example of a [[mondegreen]].

The only mention of the word &quot;Armageddon&quot; in the Bible was in Revelation 16:16: &quot;And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon&quot; (KJV).  The bible includes many passages that refer to the concept of Armageddon, however. But this specific [[bible prophecy]] reference is ambiguous as to whether any event actually takes place here or whether the gathering of armies is only to be seen as a sign. In fact, a gathering of the Roman army occurred at this place as a staging ground for one of their assaults on Jerusalem in AD 67.  This is consistent with the [[preterism|preterist]] interpretation that the events of Revelation 16:17-21 refer to events culminating in the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70. However, one indication that the book predicts a future event is the mention of an army from the east of two hundred million, a number that would not have been likely in any battle of that period.

Before the [[Second World War]], the [[First World War]] was commonly referred to in newpapers and books as &quot;Armageddon&quot;, in addition to &quot;the Great War&quot;.

&lt;!--Armageddon does not seem to be part of the Catholic Church catechism. User:Alan Liefting --&gt;
==Jehovah's Witnesses==
Armageddon in the Jehovah's Witness religion is also anticipated, as the final battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil. The battle is a situation where the kings of the Earth unite against God's appointed king, Jesus. Thus, Revelation says it is the war of the great day of Jehovah Almighty. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that unlike what others teach, the Antichrist will not be in it. Satan himself will move the kingdoms of the world to wage war on God's chosen people. But then, the &quot;King of Kings and Lord of Lords&quot; because of his righteousness will defeat them for the glory of the Almighty God. (Revelation 17:12-14) It precipitates the establishment of God's Kingdom over the earth—a period commonly referred to as Millennium, when &quot;Satan is bound for a thousand years&quot; (See Rev. 20:1,2).

The [[Last Judgment|final judgement]] and purification of the Earth's sin occurs at the end of the [[Millennium]], when Satan is &quot;loosed for a little season&quot; and allowed to &quot;go out to deceive the nations... and gather them to battle&quot; against &quot;the camp of the saints and the beloved city&quot;. Satan loses the battle and is finally cast into the &quot;lake of fire and brimstone&quot; (or complete destruction, not hell). Those who join him will suffer - like Satan - eternal destruction.

The name Har-Magedon means literally &quot;Mountain of Megiddo&quot;; &quot;mountain of rendezvous&quot;; &quot;mountain of assembly of troops&quot; and there is no literal &quot;mountain of Megiddo&quot; anywhere in the Promised Land. Revelations says that &quot;expressions inspired by demons&quot; cause the kings of the entire inhabited Earth to gather together for the war of the great day of God the Almighty. (Revelations 16:14)

It is evident from this text that this war is not one of nation against nation with nuclear, biological or other weapons of mass destruction since it says that the kings of the Earth &quot;gather together&quot;. It is also evident that there is no way that the armies of the world can gather around the relatively small area that is Megiddo in modern day Israel.  Finally, Revelation 16:16 calls Har-Mageddon (Mountain of Megiddo) &quot;the place&quot; where these kings are gathered for this final showdown. Since the Mountain of Megiddo is not a literal place, it stands to reason that these words have a symbolic meaning.

Since the area around Megiddo was of strategic importance in Biblical times and decisive battles were fought there, it is proper to use Megiddo as the &quot;symbolic&quot; place of gathering of all the kings of the Earth where they will try to do battle against God and his forces. This action on the part of the kings of the Earth is provoked by expressions and signs inspired by demons.  Their collective action to persecute God's chosen on Earth is what finally triggers this war.

The reason for this persecution is clear from the words of the Apostle Peter in 1 Peter 3:4,5 where it says &quot; because you do not continue running with them (the nations - from verse 3)in this course of the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you. But these people will render an account to the one ready to judge those living and those dead.&quot;

Jehovah's Witnesses stand apart from the world in that they do not participate in any of the many religous holidays celebrated around the world nor do they join the military forces of any nation on Earth. Their belief that only God's Kingdom can bring true peace and security on Earth instead of any human government or organization has already made them targets of persecution in many countries around the world.  It is their belief that this persecution will increase greatly in the coming years and will reach a point where all nations (inspired by the words of demons) will participate in a persecution unlike any ever seen. 

This prompts God to intervene directly against the kings of the Earth and it is at this time that they are &quot;gathered&quot; in this &quot;place&quot; for the final showdown, with devastating results.

It is then that the words of Daniel 2:44 come to pass. &quot;And in the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to time indefinite.&quot;

Chapter 38 of the book of Ezekiel has a prophecy in which a certain Gog from the land of Magog collects an army of many nations to attack God's people, believing them to be unprotected. God responds by causing them to fall one against another's sword; he strikes them with pestilence, floods, hailstones, fire and sulphur. The chapter ends with God declaring that the nations &quot;will have to know that I am Jehovah&quot;.

==Rastafari movement==
''Main article: [[Rastafari movement]]''

According to [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]], it is [[Haile Selassie]] who appears in the Book of Revelation. Armageddon (or rather &quot;''Amagideon''&quot;) is a slightly different theological concept, meaning not so much a specific battle, but rather the general state the entire world is in now, and has been getting progressively deeper in since 1930, and especially since 1974.  However, Selassie's role in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] is in many ways seen as a fulfillment of some prophecies.

==Seventh-day Adventist==
[[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] have a different interpretation — the final battle of Armageddon will take place after the thousand-year period mentioned in the book of Revelation, the period where those in Christ who have either died or lived through the Second Coming taking His name reigned with Him in Heaven.  According to this account, Christ and His saints (and the Heavenly kingdom they now reside in) will come down to Earth, shielded from the wicked.  Christ will raise the wicked dead, and both sides will engage in one final battle between good and evil.  Satan and his followers will attempt to overthrow Christ's followers, but will be overcome by the power of Christ.  Under His command, God destroys Satan and the wicked once and for all with an overwhelming fire.  The Earth will be burned, having been quenched of all evil, then, according to the final two chapters of Revelation, the Earth will then be made new and restored to its original state before sin entered into the world . . . Christ and His redeemed saints will be declared victorious.

      <comment>Changed P4 link from &quot;Intel Pentium 4&quot; to &quot;Pentium 4&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Athlon''' is the brand name applied to a series of different [[x86]] [[Central processing unit|processors]] designed and manufactured by [[AMD]]. The original Athlon, or ''Athlon Classic'', was the first seventh-generation x86 processor and, in a first, retained the initial performance lead it had over [[Intel]]'s competing processors for a significant period of time.  AMD has continued the Athlon name with the [[Athlon 64]], an eighth-generation processor featuring [[AMD64]] technology.

==Athlon Classic== 
The Athlon made its debut on [[June 23]], [[1999]]. The name &quot;Athlon&quot; was chosen by AMD as short for &quot;[[decathlon]]&quot;. The original Athlon core revision, code-named &quot;K7&quot; (in homage to its predecessor, the [[AMD K6|K6]]), was available in speeds of 500 to 700 [[Megahertz|MHz]] at its introduction and was later sold at speeds up to 1000 MHz (K75). The processor was compatible with the industry-standard x86 instruction set and plugged into a [[motherboard]] slot mechanically similar to (but not [[pin-compatibility|pin-compatible]] with) the Pentium II's [[Slot 1]].

[[Image:Slot-A Athlon.jpg|thumb|Slot-A Athlon]]
[[Image:Athlon_arch.png|300px|thumb|The AMD Athlon architecture.]]

Internally, the Athlon was essentially a major reworking of the [[AMD K6|K6]] processor core designed for compatibility with the EV6 bus protocol (first used on DEC's [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] 21264 [[RISC]] processor). AMD dramatically improved the floating-point unit from the K6 and put a large 128 KB (64 + 64 KB) L1-[[CPU cache|Cache]] on the chip. Like [[Intel]]'s [[Pentium II]] and Katmai [[Pentium III]], there was a secondary cache of 512 KB, mounted externally to the chip itself but still within the CPU module, and running at a lower speed than the core: initially half-speed (up to 700 MHz), but later runs at 2/5 (up to 850 MHz) to 1/3 (up to 1 GHz) of the core speed (because of cost and availability issues with very high speed cache [[random access memory|RAM]]). &lt;!-- Please correct this section. The Athlon is not a reworking of the K6 core --&gt;

The resulting processor was the fastest x86 CPU in the world, and various versions of the Athlon held this distinction continuously from August 1999 until January 2002. 

In commercial terms, the Athlon Classic was an enormous success — not just because of its own merits, but also because the normally dependable Intel endured a series of major production, design, and quality control issues at this time. In particular, Intel's transition to a 0.18 [[micrometre|μm]] production process, starting in late 1999 and running through to mid-2000, was chaotic, and there was a severe shortage of Pentium III parts. In contrast, AMD enjoyed a remarkably smooth process transition, had ample supplies available, and Athlon sales became quite strong. Many long-time Intel-only PC dealers found the combination of the Athlon's excellent performance and reasonable pricing tempting, and the prospect of being able to get stock in commercial volumes impossible to resist.

==Athlon Thunderbird (T-Bird)==
The second-generation Athlon, the ''Thunderbird'', debuted on [[June 5]], [[2000]]. This version of the Athlon shipped in a more traditional [[Pin grid array|pin-grid array]] (PGA) format that plugged into a socket (&quot;[[Socket A]]&quot;) on the motherboard. It was sold at speeds ranging from 700 to 1400 MHz. The major difference, however, was cache design. Just as Intel had done when they replaced the old Katmai [[Pentium III]] with the much faster Coppermine P-III, AMD replaced the 512 KB external reduced-speed cache of the Athlon Classic with 256 KB of on-chip, full-speed cache. (As a general rule, more cache improves performance, but faster cache improves it further still.)

The Thunderbird was AMD's most successful product since the [[Am386|Am386DX-40]] ten years earlier. Mainboard designs had improved considerably by this time, and the initial trickle of Athlon mainboard makers has swollen to include every major manufacturer. Their new [[Fab (semiconductors)|fab]] in [[Dresden]] came on-line, allowing further production increases, and the process technology was improved by a switch to copper interconnects. In October 2000 the Athlon &quot;C&quot; was introduced, raising the mainboard [[front side bus]] speed to 266 [[MT/s]] (133 MHz [[double-pumped]]) and providing roughly 10% extra performance over the &quot;B&quot; model Thunderbird.

==Athlon XP==
[[Image:Athlon_XP.png|200px|right|Athlon XP logo]]
In performance terms, the Thunderbird had easily eclipsed the rival Pentium III, and the early [[Pentium 4]]s were a long way off the pace, but gradually clawed their way closer. The 1.7 GHz P4 (April 2001) served notice that the Thunderbird could not count on retaining performance leadership forever, and thermal and electricity-consumption issues with the Thunderbird design meant that it wasn't practical to take it past 1400 MHz (even at that speed it was excessively hot).

===Palomino===
AMD released the third major Athlon version on [[October 9]], 2001, code-named &quot;Palomino&quot;. This version, the first to include the [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] instruction set from the Intel [[Pentium III]] as well as AMD's [[3DNow!|3DNow! Professional]], was introduced at speeds between 1333 and 1533 MHz, with ratings from 1500+ and 1800+. The major changes were optimizations to the core design to increase efficiency by roughly 10% over a Thunderbird at the same clock-speed, and power consumption reductions to allow it to be clocked faster (some parts of the chip were already built in 130 nm). It allowed AMD to take the x86 performance lead with the 1800+, increasing it upon the release of the 1900+ (running at 1600 MHz), until Intel released the 2.0 and 2.2 GHz models of the Pentium 4.

The &quot;Palomino&quot; was first released as a mobile version, called the Mobile Athlon 4 (also code-named &quot;Corvette&quot;), after the fact that it was AMD's fourth core to be called Athlon (after the original K7, the 0.18 μm K75, and the Thunderbird), but many people noted that the name was most likely a jab at the then-brand-new Intel [[Pentium 4]]. The desktop Athlon XP followed a few months later, in October.

The &quot;Palomino&quot; did have one major flaw, however: it ran very hot. Its [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] enabled version, the Athlon MP entry (which carried the Palomino core before the Athlon XP), was initially hammered due to heat issues with the Palomino core.

The ''Athlon XP'' was marketed using a [[PR rating]] system, which compared its performance to an Athlon Thunderbird. Because the Athlon XP had much higher [[Instructions Per Clock|IPC]] (instructions per clock) than the Pentium 4 (and about 10% higher than a Thunderbird), it was more efficient; it delivered the same level of performance at a lower clock-speed, or higher performance at the same speed.

===Thoroughbred (T-Bred)===
[[Image:AMD-Athlon-XP-2100l.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Athlon XP 2100 Thoroughbred{{ifdc|February_27}}]]
The fourth-generation Athlon, the ''Thoroughbred'', was released [[10 June]] [[2002]] at 1.8 GHz, or 2200+ on the PR rating system. There were actually two versions of this core, commonly called A and B. The A version was the one introduced at 1800 MHz, which had some heat issues, so it was only sold in versions from 1333 to 1800 MHz, replacing the Palomino.
The B version, which had an additional metal layer, was released at higher clock speeds, up to the 2800+ model, which ran at 2250 MHz. Later, it replaced the entire Athlon XP line until the launch of the ''Barton'' core.
Two new models, the 2400+ and 2600+, were announced on [[21 August]] [[2002]]. The 2400+ ran at 2000 MHz, and the 2600+ ran at 2083 or 2133 MHz, depending on the [[front side bus]] speed (2083 MHz for 333 MT/s FSB, 2133 MHz for 266 MT/s FSB). 2700+ and 2800+ ''Thoroughbred'' parts were also announced, but were only available in very small quantities. 

The &quot;Thoroughbred&quot; core was on a 0.13 micrometre (130 nm) process, updated from the 0.18 micrometre (180 nm) process of its &quot;Palomino&quot; predecessor. Other than the new process, the Thoroughbred design was not different from the &quot;Palomino&quot; in any way. AMD did have initial troubles with the &quot;Thoroughbred A&quot; revision having substantial heat issues, which were solved in the &quot;B&quot; revision. The rev. A may have been on the 130 nm process, but it offered no real improvements over the old Palomino. Overclockers still liked to use the Palomino; even with it being made on the 180 nm process, it still was able to hit higher clock speeds. The Thoroughbred &quot;B&quot; fixed this problem by adding an extra metal layer to the manufacturing process, allowing enhanced speeds that would allow them to conquer the market again. At first, 2600+ was released. Later, AMD raised the FSB from 266 MT/s (133 MHz double-pumped) to 333 MT/s (166 MHz double-pumped). This allowed the company to raise the performance rating numbers of the CPUs without actually upping the clock speed much. However, AMD failed to manufacture and ship acceptable amounts of the highest-end 2700+ and 2800+ Thoroughbreds, and as a result they were hard to obtain.

===Barton and Thorton===
Fifth-generation Athlon ''Barton''-core processors released in early 2003 featured PR ratings of 2500+, 2600+, 2800+, 3000+, and 3200+. While not faster than ''Thoroughbred''-core processors in clock speed, they earned their higher PR-rating-per-clock by featuring an additional 256 KB of full-speed on-chip level 2 cache, for a total of 512 KB, and a faster FSB. The ''Thorton'' core was a variant of the ''Barton'' with half of the L2 cache disabled and thus functionally identical to the ''Thoroughbred B'' core. The disabled L2 cache on some ''Thortons'' was partially defective, but on others it could be re-enabled through bridge modifications. [http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/cpu/display/20030930171549.html]

As with most Athlons, the Barton core was popular with overclockers. For example, the 2500+ was rated to run an a 333 MT/s (166 MHz double-pumped) bus. By upping this to 400 MT/s (200 MHz double-pumped), it became equivalent to the much more expensive 3200+. Some suspect this was the reason for the relatively short retail lifespan of the lower-rated Bartons, which were the first to be replaced by the cut-down Semprons.

Some AMD proponents claim that these new parts regained performance leadership for the Athlon, but this remained in doubt. Much controversy surrounds the [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]s which are used to measure performance leadership. In particular, industry insiders point out that some tests have been deliberately skewed in Intel's favour—notably the BAPCo tests, which were written by Intel's own engineers. Other insiders accused AMD's model numbers of no longer being internally consistent, and also accused them of basing their processor ratings on applications which were no longer widely used.

Most observers considered the Athlon no longer the fastest x86 processor in the world, believing that Intel's Pentium 4 overtook the Athlon XP early in 2002 and held its lead until February 2003, with the 3.06 GHz P4 benchmarking slightly faster than the Athlon 2700+.  At the time, the question was moot: AMD had yet to deliver the 2700+ and 2800+ in commercial quantities; they did not begin to ship in volume until well into the first quarter of 2003. However, as the initially troublesome transition to the 0.13 micrometre process neared completion, AMD began producing large numbers of 0.13 micrometre parts in the 1700+ to 2400+ speed grades (usually a sign that faster grades are not far away). In mid February 2003, they announced the Athlon XP 3000+ to ship in volume in early March of 2003. Pending an Intel reply, the 3000+ had according to AMD reclaimed the &quot;fastest x86 in the world&quot; title for the Athlon once again. However, reviewers' opinions on this were split, and most still believed the top Intel part to be faster. A month later, Intel introduced a new series of Pentium 4s which had a faster 800 MT/s, or 200 MHz quad-pumped bus (previously it was 533 MT/s, or 133 MHz quad-pumped. The new bus was indicated by the &quot;C&quot; appendage at the end of the model number) and support for [[Hyper-Threading]]. In response, AMD released the Athlon XP 3000+ and 3200+ featuring a 400 MT/s bus. Unfortunately, the bus speed increase did not offer a large performance gain. The 3200+ failed to convincingly outperform the new 3.0 GHz Pentium 4 &quot;C&quot;, much less the subsequent 3.2 GHz version. Many reviewers concluded that the C-series Pentium 4 was a bridge too far for the Athlon XP, and that Intel had gained a decisive performance lead which the Athlon XP could not overcome. However, AMD did not try to do so; their focus was now on the soon-to-be released K8, the [[Athlon 64]].

===Mobile Athlon XP===
[[Image:Athlon_XPM_2400l.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Athlon XP 2400+ Mobile]]
Mobile Athlon XPs (''Athlon XP-M'') are identical to normal Athlon XPs, apart from running at lower voltages and not being multiplier-locked. The lower vcore ratings allow the CPU to run with less power consumption (ideal for battery-powered laptops) and produce less heat. They are also capable of having their multipliers dynamically adjusted by software to supply faster speeds at higher frequencies when demanded, but throttle back to lower speeds and voltages when CPU demand is lower.

The Athlon XP-M replaced the older Mobile Athlon 4. The Mobile Athlon 4 used the older ''Palomino'' core, while the Athlon XP-M uses the newer ''Thoroughbred'' and ''Barton'' cores.

It also features '''Power Now!''' where the CPU's clock speed is automatically decreased when the computer is under a low load, to save battery power and reduce heat. Similar to Intel's [[SpeedStep]] technology.

Some specialized low-power Athlon XP-Ms utilise the microPGA [[socket 563]] rather than the standard Socket A.

Athlon XP-Ms on desktop computers became very popular with [[overclocking|overclockers]], as well as [[underclocking|underclockers]], by early 2004, in part because their multipliers are unlocked.  Athlon XP-Ms are structurally identical to Desktop Athlon cousins but are singled out for their ability to operate at voltages well below normal. Since they are so efficient with voltage, they respond extremely well to increased voltages and overclock extremely well. Athlon XP-Ms overclock demonstrably better than multiplier unlocked Desktop Athlon XPs with the same &quot;Barton&quot; core. Some ''Barton'' core Athlon XP-Ms have been successfully overclocked to as high as 3.1 GHz.

Mobile Athlon XPs are also attractive CPUs for use in [[HTPC|home theater]] systems due to their high performance and ability to underclock and undervolt for quiet operation needed in the living room.

Amnon was the progeny of David and [[Ahinoam]]. Tamar and Absalom were the progeny of David and [[Maachah]]. Thus Amnon and Absalom were half-brothers, like [[Abraham]]'s son's [[Ishmael]] and [[Isaac]].

Jewish law forbade Amnon to marry a half-sister, and taking evil advice he pretended to be sick. He lured Tamar into his quarters with the pretense that he wanted her to cook a special meal for him, ignored her protests and had sexual intercourse with her. Two years later, Absalom engineered Amnon's death.

[[image:Aral_map.png|thumb|200px|Map of area around the Aral Sea. Aral Sea boundaries are circa 1960.  Countries at least partially in the Aral Sea watershed are in yellow.]]

The '''Amu Darya''' (also ''Amudarya'', ''Amudar'ya'', in [[Persian language|Persian]] &amp;#1570;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1583;&amp;#1585;&amp;#1740;&amp;#1575;; ''Darya'' means &quot;[[Sea]]&quot; in Persian and ''Amu'' means &quot;[[river]]&quot; in [[Turkic]]), is a river in [[Central Asia]]. It is navigable for over 1,450 km (800 miles). Its total length is 2,400 km (1,500 miles). 
In [[Classical Antiquity]], the river was known as the '''Oxus''' in [[Greek language|Greek]].

It rises in the [[Pamir Mountains]] as the '''Pamir River''', emerging from [[Zorkul]], flowing east until [[Ishtragh]], where it turns north and then east north-west through the [[Hindu Kush]] as the '''[[Panj]]''', forming the border of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]], and subsequently the border of Afghanistan and [[Uzbekistan]] for about 200 km, passing [[Termez]] and the [[Afghanistan-Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge]]. It follows the border of Afghanistan and [[Turkmenistan]] for another 100 km before it flows into Turkmenistan at [[Kerki]]. As '''Amudarya''', it flows across Turkmenistan south to north, passing [[Turkmenabat]], and forms the border of Turkmenistan and [[Uzbekistan]] from [[Khalkabad]]. It is then split into many waterways that used to form the [[river delta]] joining the [[Aral Sea]], passing [[Urgench]], [[Daşoguz|Dashoguz]] and other cities, but it does not reach what is left of the sea anymore and is lost in the desert.

Use of water from the Amu Darya for [[irrigation]] has been a major contributing factor in the shrinking of the Aral Sea since the late [[1950s]].

Historical records state that in different periods the river flowed into the Aral Sea (from the south), the [[Caspian Sea]] (from the east) or both, similar to the [[Syr Darya]] ('''Jaxartes''', in [[Ancient Greek]]).

==The Islamic Conquest==
[[Image:Age of Caliphs.gif|225px|thumb|left|The Age of the Caliphs]]
In [[637]], five years after the death of the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]], [[Arab]] Muslims shattered the might of the [[Iran]]ian [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanians]] at the Battles of [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah|al-Qādisiyyah]] and [[Nahavand]].  The invaders began to move towards the lands east of Iran: [[Herat]] was captured in 652. By 709 all of Aryana came under Arab control and encountered pockets of resistance from local tribesmen for centuries. In addition, [[Tang China]] and [[Tibet]] mounted an opposition to the Arab invasion to prevent their incursions into Central Asia. Central Asia and eastern Iran were nominally under Chinese soverignty for five years in the early eighth century. Native [[Persian language|Iranian]]-speaking Muslims and assimilated [[Khurasan]]i Arabs took power from the Arab elites in Damascus and Baghdad, and helped the local languages and much of the pre-Islamic Iranic culture survive. The Persians then annexed the regions around Kabul from the Hindu [[Shahi]]s as well. By the middle of the eighth century, the rising [[Abbasid Dynasty]] slowed Arab expansion and began a policy of consolidation. Peace prevailed under the rule of the Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] ([[785]]-[[809]]) and his successors and higher learning flourished in such [[Central Asia|Central Asian]] cities as [[Samarkand]] and [[Tashkent]]. 

[[Image:Biruni-russian.jpg|200px|thumb|Biruni commemorated on a Soviet stamp for his millennial anniversary.]]

From the seventh through the ninth centuries, many inhabitants of what is present-day [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], southern parts of the former [[Soviet Union]], and areas of northern [[India]] were converted to [[Sunni Islam]]. However some small pockets of pre-Islamic peoples such as the Kafirs of [[Kafiristan]] (modern [[Nuristan]]) managed to remain untouched by the Muslim faith, and were not converted until 1896. It is surmised from the writings of [[Al Biruni]] that the Pashtuns and/or other local Afghans in eastern Afghanistan had not been completely converted. Al Biruni, writing in [[Tarikh al Hind]], also alludes to the eastern Afghans as being neither Muslim nor Hindu, but simply Afghans which may mean that the local population of eastern Afghanistan were pagans and animists not unlike the Kafirs and [[Kalash]] prior to the coming of Islamic invaders.  

In the eighth and ninth centuries ancestors of many of today's [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking Afghans settled in northern Afghanistan (partly to obtain better grazing land) near the modern borders with [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]] and some may have begun to assimilate much of the [[Culture of Iran|Iranian]] culture and language of the [[Pashtun]] and [[Tajik]] tribes already present there (see [[Ghilzai]] for further details).

By the middle of the ninth century, Abbasid rule went into decline, and semi-independent states began to emerge throughout the former Arab empire. In Central Asia, three short-lived, local dynasties ascended to power. The best known of the three, the [[Samanid Dynasty|Samanid]], extended its rule from [[Bukhara]] to as far south as the [[Indus]] and west into most of Iran. Although Arab Muslim intellectual life was still centered in [[Baghdad]], Iranian Muslim scholarship, that is, [[Shi'a Islam]], predominated in the Samanid areas at this time. By the mid-tenth century, the Samanid Dynasty had crumbled in the face of attacks from Turkish tribes to the north and from the [[Ghaznavids]], a rising Turkic dynasty in Afghanistan.

== Ghaznavid and Ghorid Rule ==

Out of the [[Samanid Dynasty]] came the first great [[Islam]]ic empire of the region, the [[Ghaznavid Empire]], whose warriors, forged an empire that spanned much of Iranian plateau and Central Asia and conducted many successful raids into [[South Asia]]. Their military incursions assured the domination of [[Sunni Islam]] in what is now Afghanistan, [[Pakistan]], and parts of India. The most renowned of the dynasty's rulers was [[Mahmud of Ghaznavid|Mahmud]], who consolidated control over the areas south of the [[Amu Darya]] then carried out devastating raids into India - looting [[Hindu]] temples in his wake. With his booty from India, Mahmud built a great capital at [[Ghazni]], founded universities, and patronized scholars. Mahmud was recognized by the caliph in [[Baghdad]] as the temporal heir of the Samanids. By the time of his death, Mahmud ruled a vast empire that stretched from [[Kurdistan]] to the entire [[Hindu Kush]] region as far east as the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] as well as territories far north of the [[Amu Darya]]. However, as occurred so often in this region, the demise in [[1030]] of this military genius who had expanded the empire to its farthest reaches was the death knell of the dynasty itself. The [[Tajik]] rulers of the [[Ghowr|Kingdom of Ghor]] (also Ghur), southeast of [[Herat]], captured and burned Ghazni in [[1149]], just as the Ghaznavids had once conquered [[Ghor]]. Not until [[1186]], however, was the last representative of the Ghaznavids uprooted by the Ghorids (Ghurids) from his holdout in [[Lahore]], in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab ]].

The Ghorids controlled most of what is now Afghanistan, eastern [[Iran]], Pakistan, and northern India, while parts of central and western Iran were ruled by the [[Seljuk Turks]]. From [[1200]] to [[1205]] most of the Ghorid lands were conquered by the [[Shah]] of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]], whose empire would, in turn, be defeated by the Mongols in [[1220]].

== Mongol Rule, [[1220]]-[[1506]] ==
[[Image:TimurExhumed2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Reconstruction of Timur from exhumation of his tomb.]]
Followings years of conquest in China and Central Asia, the [[Mongol Empire]] had emerged as a major world power of its day and attempted to co-exist with some of their neighbors including the empire the [[Khwarezmia]] Shah (which included what is today Afghanistan) and sent emissaries to establish diplomatic and trading links. As either a bluff to dissuade the Mongols from aggression or as simply a haughty sign of disrespect, the Khwarezmia Shah [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Ala ad-Din Muhammad II]] had the diplomats executed and sent their heads back to the Mongols and this prompted a military confrontation. In [[1220]], the [[Islam|Islamic]] lands of [[Central Asia]] were overrun by the armies of the [[Mongol]] invader [[Genghis Khan]] (ca. [[1155]]-[[1227]]), who laid waste to many cities and settlements and created an empire that stretched from [[China]] to the [[Caucasus]]. The Mongols under [[Genghis Khan]] responded with great severity to the insults they had taken from Muhammad II and took out their revenge against the inhabitants of Khwarezmia including, for example, exterminating every human being, including women and children, in the cities of Herat and Balkh. This devastation had severe consequences for the natives of Afghanistan as the destruction caused by the Mongols depopulated many of the major cities and caused much of the population to revert to an agrarian rural society. Thus, Afghanistan became dominated by cattlebreeding tribes who also specialized in horseback riding. [[Genghis Khan]] failed to extinguish or even particularly hamper Islam in Central Asia, if that was even his intent, as the religion continued to define many local inhabitants culturally. In fact, by the end of the 13th century, Genghis Khan's descendants had themselves become Muslims (many speculate that the [[Hazara]]s of Afghanistan are in fact the descendents of Genghis Khan and his Mongol hordes) and even the title of 'khan' became a not so uncommon name adopted by many local inhabitants. From the death of Genghis Khan in [[1227]] until the rise of [[Timur Lenk]] (Tamerlane) in the [[1380s]], Central Asia went through a period of fragmentation.

A product of both [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] and Mongol descent, Timur claimed Genghis Khan as an ancestor. From his capital of [[Samarkand]], Timur created an empire that, by the late fourteenth century, extended from northern [[India]] to eastern [[Turkey]]. The turn of the sixteenth century brought an end to the [[Timurid Empire]] when another Central Asian ruler of Turkic-Mongol extraction, [[Muhammad Shaybani]], overwhelmed the weakened Timurid ruler in [[Herat]]. Shaybani (also a descendant of Genghis Khan) and his successors ruled the area around the [[Amu Darya]] for about a century, while to the south and west of what is now [[Afghanistan]] two powerful dynasties began to compete for influence.

== Mughal-Safavid Rivalry, ca. [[1500]]-[[1747]] ==

Early in the sixteenth century, [[Babur]], who was descended from [[Timur]] on his father's side and from [[Genghis Khan]] on his mother's, was driven out of his father's kingdom in the [[Ferghana Valley]] (which straddles contemporary [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]) by the [[Uzbeks|Shaybani Uzbeks]], who had wrested [[Samarkand]] from the [[Timurid Empire|Timurids]]. After several unsuccessful attempts to regain Ferghana and Samarkand, Babur crossed the [[Amu Darya]] and captured [[Kabul]] from the last of its [[Mongol]] rulers in 1504. In his invasion of [[Delhi Sultanate]] of [[India]] in 1526, Babur's army of 12,000 defeated a less mobile force of 100,000 at the [[First Battle of Panipat]], about forty-five kilometers northwest of [[Delhi]]. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] was itself ruled by ex-patriot Afghan/Pashtun rulers, the [[Lodhi dynasty]]. Although the [[Mughal Empire]] would shift largely to India, Babur's memoirs, as related in the ''Baburnameh'' stressed his love for Kabul - both as a commercial strategic center as well as a beautiful highland city with an &quot;extremely delightful&quot; climate and was the Mughal Empire's first capital until being moved to Lahore and Delhi by later emperors.

Although Mughal rule technically lasted in parts of Afghanistan until the early 18th century, it came under constant challenge from local Pashtun tribesmen. The Mughals originally had come from [[Central Asia]], but once they had taken India, the area that is now southeastern [[Afghanistan]] and western [[North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan|Pakistan]] was relegated to a mere outpost of the empire as even the name of a prominent Afghan city, Peshawar literally translates from Persian to ''City on the Frontier''. Indeed, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, much of Afghanistan was hotly contested between the Mughals of India and the [[Safavids]] of [[Iran]]. The Safavids had held Herat and much of western and northern Afghanistan during the same time period that the Mughals controlled Kabul, Kandahar, and Peshawar. Just as Kabul dominates the high road from Central Asia into India, [[Kandahar]] commands the only approach towards India that skirts the Hindu Kush. The strategically important Kabul-Kandahar axis was the primary focus of competition between the Mughals and the Safavids, and Kandahar itself changed hands several times during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Safavids and the Mughals were not the only contenders, however. Less powerful but closer at hand were the [[Uzbek|Uzbeks]] of Central Asia, who fought for control of [[Herat]] in western Afghanistan and for the northern regions as well where neither the Mughals nor the Safavids were able to effectively challenge them. Many of the Uzbeks of Afghanistan arrived during this phase of northern Afghanistan's history.

The Mughals sought not only to block the historical western invasion routes into India but also to control the fiercely independent [[Pashtun]] tribes who accepted only nominal control from Delhi in their mountain strongholds between the Kabul-Kandahar axis and the [[Indus River]] - especially in the [[Pashtun]] area of the [[Suleiman Mountains|Suleiman Range]]. As the area around Kandahar changed hands back and forth between the two great empires on either side, the local Pashtun tribes exploited the situation to their advantage by extracting concessions from both sides. By the middle of the seventeenth century, the Mughals had abandoned the Hindu Kush north of Kabul to the Uzbeks, and in 1622 they lost Kandahar to the Safavids for the third and final time.

Toward the end of the seventeenth century, as the power of the Safavids waned, native groups began to assert themselves in Afghanistan. Early in the eighteenth century, a clan of the [[Ghilzai|Ghilzai Pashtuns]], later known as the [[Hotaki]] dynasty, overturned Safavid rule in Kandahar by 1708, and subsequently took-over and ruled most of Safavid Persia and Afghanistan from 1722 until 1736. The Ghilzai Pashtuns managed to briefly hold the Safavid capital of [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], and two members of this tribe ascended the throne before the Ghilzai were evicted from Iran by the Turko-Iranian conqueror, [[Nadir Shah]], who became known by some in the West as the &quot;Persian Napoleon.&quot;

Nadir Shah conquered Kandahar and Kabul in 1738 along with defeating a formidable Mughal army in India, plundering Delhi, and massacring thousands of its people. He returned home with vast treasures, including the [[Peacock Throne]], which thereafter served as a symbol of Iranian imperial might. Nadir Shah, as a Sunni Muslim, had surrounded himself with other Sunnis most notably those of Turkic and Pashtun background. One notable military officer was [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali]], an ethnic Pashtun who would come to shape the modern history of Afghanistan following the end of Nadir Shah's reign.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Durrani Empire.gif|200px|thumb|left|Map of the Afghan Durrani Empire]] --&gt;

The '''Durrani Empire''' was a state in present day [[Afghanistan]].  From [[1747]] until [[1823]] [[Ahmad Shah]] and his sons and grandsons held the monarchy. The name &quot;Afghanistan&quot; is mentioned since 1801 in the Anglo-Persian peace treaty for the first time officially. They were the first [[Pashtun]] rulers of Afghanistan, from the [[Sadozai]] line of the Abdali or [[Durrani]] group of clans. It was under the leadership of Ahmad Shah that the nation of Afghanistan began to take shape following centuries of fragmentation and exploitation. Even before the death of the Turko-[[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] ruler [[Nadir Shah]], tribes in the [[Afghanistan]] had been growing stronger and were beginning to take advantage of the waning power of their distant rulers.

== Reign of Ahmad Shah ([[1747]]-[[1772]]) ==
[[Image:Ahmad_Shah_Durrani.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Ahmad Shah Durrani]]
[[Nadir Shah]]'s rule abruptly ended in June 1747 when he was assassinated. Some believe that [[Ahmad Shah]] had something to do with his death, but the evidence remains somewhat circumstantial. Regardless, Ahmad Shah took the opportunity to move towards the creation of a separate state in the eastern Persian Empire in what is today Afghanistan and western Pakistan. In 1747 Ahmad Shah and his Abdali horsemen joined the chiefs of the [[Durrani|Abdali]] tribes and clans near [[Kandahar]] at a [[loya jirga]] to choose a leader. Despite being younger than other claimants, Ahmad had several overriding factors in his favor. He was a direct descendant of [[Sado]], [[eponym]] of the [[Sadozai]], the most prominent tribe amongst the Pashtuns at the time; he was unquestionably a charismatic leader and seasoned warrior who had at his disposal a trained, mobile force of several thousand cavalrymen; and he possessed part of Nadir Shah's treasury.

One of Ahmad Shah's first acts as chief was to adopt the title &quot;Durr-i-Durrani&quot; (&quot;pearl of pearls&quot; or &quot;pearl of the age&quot;), which may have come from a dream or from the pearl earrings worn by the royal guard of Nadir Shah. The Abdali Pashtuns were known thereafter as the [[Durrani]].

Ahmad Shah began his rule by capturing [[Ghazni]] from the [[Ghilzai|Ghilzai Pashtuns]], and then wresting [[Kabul]] from the local ruler. In 1749 the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ruler ceded sovereignty over [[Sindh]] Province and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] west of the [[Indus River]] to Ahmad Shah in order to save his capital from Afghan attack. Ahmad Shah then set out westward to take possession of [[Herat]], which was ruled by Nadir Shah's grandson, [[Shah Rukh of Persia]]. Herat fell to Ahmad after almost a year of siege and bloody conflict, as did [[Mashhad]] (in present-day [[Iran]]). Ahmad next sent an army to subdue the areas north of the Hindu Kush. In short order, the powerful army brought under its control the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Uzbek]], [[Tajiks|Tajik]], and [[Hazara]] tribes of northern Afghanistan. Ahmad invaded the remanants of the [[Mughal Empire]] a third, then a fourth, time, consolidating control of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Kashmir]]. Then, early in 1757, he sacked [[Delhi]], but permitted the Mughal Dynasty to remain in nominal control as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad's suzerainty over the Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir. Leaving his second son [[Timur Shah]] to safeguard his interests, Ahmad left India to return to Afghanistan.

The collapse of Mughal control in India, however, also facilitated the rise of rulers other than Ahmad Shah. In the Punjab, the [[Sikhs]] emerged as a potent force. From their capital at [[Pune]], the [[Marathas]], [[Hindu|Hindus]] who controlled much of western and central India, were beginning to look northward to the decaying Mughal empire, which Ahmad Shah now claimed by conquest. Upon his return to Kandahar in [[1757]], Ahmad was forced to return to India and face the formidable attacks of the Maratha Confederacy, which succeeded in ousting Timur and his court in India.

Ahmad Shah declared a [[jihad]] (or [[Islam]]ic holy war) against the Marathas, and warriors from various Pashtun tribes, as well as other tribes such as the [[Baloch]], [[Tajiks]], and Muslims in India, answered his call. Early skirmishes ended in victory for the Afghans, and by [[1759]] Ahmad and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By [[1760]] the Maratha groups had coalesced into a great army that probably outnumbered Ahmad Shah's forces. Once again [[Panipat]] was the scene of a confrontation between two warring contenders for control of northern India. The [[Third Battle of Panipat|Battle of Panipat]] in [[1761]] between largely [[Islam|Muslim]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] armies who numbered as many as 100,000 troops each was fought along a twelve-kilometer front. Despite decisively defeating the Marathas, what might have been Ahmad Shah's peaceful control of his domains was disrupted by other challenges.

The victory at Panipat was the high point of Ahmad Shah's--and Afghan--power. His Durrani Empire was one of the largest Islamic empires in the world at that time. However, even prior to his death, the empire began to unravel. By the end of 1761, the Sikhs had gained power and taken control of much of the Punjab. In [[1762]] Ahmad Shah crossed the passes from Afghanistan for the sixth time to subdue the Sikhs. He assaulted Lahore and, after taking their holy city of [[Amritsar]], massacred thousands of Sikh inhabitants, destroying their temples and desecrating their holy places with cow's blood. Within two years the Sikhs rebelled again. Ahmad Shah tried several more times to subjugate the Sikhs permanently, but failed. By the time of his death, he had lost all but nominal control of the Punjab to the Sikhs, who remained in charge of the area until defeated by the [[British Empire|British]] in the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] in [[1846]].

Ahmad Shah also faced other rebellions in the north, and eventually he and the Uzbek Emir of [[Bukhara]] agreed that the [[Amu Darya]] would mark the division of their lands. In [[1772]] Ahmad Shah retired to his home in the mountains east of Kandahar, where he died. Ahmad Shah had succeeded to a remarkable degree in balancing tribal alliances and hostilities and in directing tribal energies away from rebellion. He earned recognition as Ahmad Shah Baba, or &quot;Father&quot; of Afghanistan.

By the time of Ahmad Shah's ascendancy, the Pashtuns included many groups whose origins were obscure; most were believed to have descended from ancient [[Aryan]] tribes, but some, such as the Ghilzai, may have intermingled with [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], while others such as the Durrani became persianized due to their contacts with the Tajiks. They had in common, however, their Pashtu language and belief in common ancestry that sometimes united them. To the east, the [[Waziri|Waziris]] and their close relatives, the [[Mahsud|Mahsuds]], had lived in the hills of the central [[Sulaiman Mountains]] since the fourteenth century. By the end of the sixteenth century and the final Turkish-[[Mongol]] invasions, tribes such as the [[Shinwari|Shinwaris]], [[Yousafzai|Yusufzais]], and [[Mohmand|Mohmands]] had moved from the upper [[Kabul River]] valley into the valleys and plains west, north, and northeast of [[Peshawar]]. The [[Afridi|Afridis]] had long been established in the hills and mountain ranges south of the [[Khyber Pass]]. By the end of the [[18th Century|eighteenth century]], the Durranis had blanketed the area west and north of Kandahar and were to be found as far east as [[Quetta]], [[Baluchistan]].

== Reign of Timur Shah ([[1772]]-[[1793]]) ==

[[Timur Shah]] had 24 sons, several of whom became kings.

[[Ahmad Shah]]'s successors governed so ineptly during a period of profound unrest that within fifty years of his death, [[Afghanistan]] was embroiled in a civil war. Many of the territories conquered with the help of Ahmad Shah's military skill fell to others in this half century. By [[1818]] the Sadozai rulers who succeeded Ahmad Shah controlled little more than [[Kabul]] and the surrounding territory within a 160-kilometer radius. They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated other tribes and lineages among the Durrani [[Pashtuns]].

== Reign of Zaman Shah ([[1793]]-[[1801]])==

After the death of Timur Shah, the three strongest contenders for the position of shah were Timur's sons, the governors of [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], and [[Kabul]]. [[Zaman Shah]], governor of Kabul, was in the most commanding position and became shah at the age of twenty-three. His half-brothers accepted this only by force majeure--upon being imprisoned on their arrival in the capital for the purpose, ironically, of electing a new shah. The quarrels among Timur's descendants that threw Afghanistan into turmoil also provided the pretext for the intervention of outside forces.

The efforts of the Sadozai heirs of Timur to impose a true monarchy on the truculent [[Pashtun]] tribes and to rule absolutely and without the advice of the other, larger Pashtun tribes' leaders were ultimately unsuccessful. The [[Sikhs]] too, were particularly troublesome, and after several unsuccessful efforts to subdue them, Zaman made the mistake of appointing a forceful young Sikh chief, [[Ranjit Singh]], as his governor in the Punjab. The &quot;one-eyed&quot; warrior would later become an implacable enemy of Pashtun rulers in Afghanistan.

Zaman's downfall was triggered by his attempts to consolidate power. Although it had been through the support of the [[Muhammadzai]] chief, [[Painda Khan]], that he had come to the throne, Zaman soon began to remove prominent Muhammadzai leaders from positions of power and replacing them with men of his own lineage, the [[Sadozai]]. This upset the delicate balance of Durrani tribal politics that Ahmad Shah had established and may have prompted Painda Khan and other Durrani chiefs to plot against the shah. Painda Khan and the chiefs of the [[Nurzai]] and the [[Alizai]] Durrani clans were executed, as was the chief of the [[Qizilbash]] clan. Painda Khan's son fled to [[Iran]] and pledged the substantial support of his Muhammadzai followers to a rival claimant to the throne, Zaman's older brother, [[Mahmud Shah]]. The clans of the chiefs Zaman had executed joined forces with the rebels, and they took Kandahar without bloodshed.

== First Reign of Mahmud Shah ([[1801]]-[[1803]]) ==

Zeman Shah's overthrow in [[1801]] was not the end of civil strife in [[Afghanistan]] but the beginning of even greater violence. [[Mahmud Shah (ruler of Afghanistan)|Mahmud Shah]]'s first reign lasted only for two years before he was replaced by [[Shuja Shah]].

== Reign of Shuja Shah ([[1803]]-[[1809]]) ==

Yet another of Timur Shah's sons, [[Shuja Shah]], ruled for only six years. On [[June 7]], [[1809]], Shoja signed a [[Treaty of Friendship]] with the [[United Kingdom|British]] which included a clause stating that he would oppose the passage of foreign troops through his territories. This agreement, the first Afghan pact with a [[European]] power, stipulated joint action in case of [[France|Franco]]-[[Iran|Persia]]n aggression against Afghan or British dominions. Only a few weeks after signing the agreement, Shoja was deposed by his predecessor, Mahmud.  Much later he was reinstated by the British, ruling during [[1839]]-[[1842]].  Two of his sons also ruled for a short time in 1842).

== Second Reign of Mahmud Shah ([[1809]]-[[1818]]) ==

Mahmud's second reign lasted nine years. Mahmud alienated the [[Muhammadzai]], especially [[Fateh Khan]], the son of [[Painda Khan]], who was eventually seized and blinded. Revenge would later be sought and obtained by Fateh Khan's youngest brother, [[Dost Mahommed Khan]].

== Reign of Sultan Ali Shah ([[1818]]-[[1819]]) ==

[[Sultan Ali Shah]] was another son of [[Timur Shah]].

== Reign of Ayub Shah ([[1819]]-[[1823]]) ==

[[Ayub Shah]] was another son of Timur Shah, who deposed Sultan Ali Shah.  He was himself deposed and presumably killed in [[1823]].

From 1818 until Dost Mohammad's ascendancy in 1826, chaos reigned in the domains of Ahmad Shah Durrani's empire as various sons of [[Painda Khan]] struggled for supremacy. Afghanistan ceased to exist as a single nation, disintegrating for a brief time into a fragmented collection of small units.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Aimak''' (or ''Eimak'', ''Aimaq'') are [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking [[nomad]]ic or semi-nomadic tribes of mixed [[Iranian people|Iranian]] and [[Mongols|Mongolian]] stock inhabiting the north and north-west [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[highland]]s immediately to the north of [[Herat]]. They are closely related to the [[Hazara]]. They live in western [[Hazarajat]] in the provinces of [[Ghowr Province|Ghowr]], [[Farah Province|Farah]], [[Herat Province|Herat]], [[Badghis Province|Badghis]], [[Faryab Province|Faryab]], [[Jowzjan Province|Jowzjan]] and [[Sar-e Pol Province|Sar-e Pol]]. The name is [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] for [[clan]], or section of a tribe.

They were originally known as ''chahar'' (the four) Eimaks, because there were four principal [[tribe]]s: the [[Taimani]] (the predominating element in the population of [[Ghur]]), the [[Ferozkhoi]], the [[Temuri]], and the [[Jamshidi]]. 
Estimates of the Aimak population vary between a quarter of a million and 2 million. They are [[Sunni]] [[Muslims]] in distinction from the Hazara who are [[Shiite]]s.  They are predominantly of [[Iran]]ian or quasi-Iranian blood, while the Hazara are [[Turanian]].  They are a bold, wild people and renowned fighters. 

The Aimagh population in [[Afghanistan]] is estimated to be 1-2 million. The calculation is made difficult by the fact that due to centuries of oppression of the [[Hazara]] people, some Aimagh [[Hazara]]s are classified officially as [[Tajiks|Tajik]], or [[Persians|Persian]]).

Playing on this [[sectarian divide]]s, successive [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] governments (usually dominated by the ethnic [[Pashtun]]s) divided the Aimaks and the Hazaras politically, listing them as separate nationalities in the list of the ethnic groups of Afghanistan, thereby reducing the Hazara population in the national percentage.  

They are supposed to be descendants of Turkish-[[Tatars|Tatar]] tribes which under [[Hulagu Khan]] overthrew the Persian [[Caliphate]] in the middle of the thirteenth century.
