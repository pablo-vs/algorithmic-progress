'''Aaron'''
('''&amp;#1488;&amp;#1463;&amp;#1492;&amp;#1458;&amp;#1512;&amp;#1465;&amp;#1503;''', a word meaning &quot;bearer of martyrs&quot; in Hebrew (perhaps also, or instead, related to the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] &quot;Aha Rw,&quot; &quot;Warrior Lion&quot;), [[Standard Hebrew]] '''Aharon''', [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''&amp;#702;Ah&amp;#259;r&amp;#333;n'''), was one of two brothers who play a unique part in the history of the [[Hebrew people]]. He was the elder son of [[Amram]] and [[Jochebed]] of the tribe of [[Levi]]; [[Moses]], the other son, being three years younger, and [[Miriam]], their sister, several years older ([[Exodus]] 2:4; [[Exodus]] 6:16 ff.; [[Numbers]] 33:39). Aaron was the great-grandson of [[Levi]] ([[Exodus]] 6:16-20) and represented the priestly functions of his tribe. While [[Moses]] was receiving his education at the [[Egypt]]ian court and during his exile among the [[Midianites]], Aaron and his sister remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of [[Egypt]]. Here he gained a name for eloquent and persuasive speech; so that when the time came for the demand upon [[Pharaoh]] to release Israel from captivity, Aaron became his brother’s ''nabi '', or spokesman, to his own people ([[Exodus]] 4:16) and, after their unwillingness to hear, to [[Pharaoh]] himself ([[Exodus]] 7:9).

==His function==
Aaron’s function included the duties of speaker and implied personal dealings with the court on behalf of [[Moses]], who was always the central moving figure. The part played by Aaron in the events that preceded the [[Exodus]] was, therefore, ministerial, and not directive. He, along with [[Moses]], performed “signs” before his people which impressed them with a belief in the reality of the divine mission of the brothers ([[Exodus]] 4:15-16). At the command of [[Moses]] he stretched out his rod in order to bring on the first three plagues ([[Exodus]] 7:19, 8:1, 12). In the infliction of the remaining plagues he appears to have acted merely as the attendant of [[Moses]], whose outstretched rod drew the divine wrath upon [[Pharaoh]] and his subjects ([[Exodus]] 9:23, 10:13, 22). The potency of Aaron’s rod had already been demonstrated by its victory over the rods of the [[Egypt]]ian magicians, which it swallowed after all the rods alike had been turned into serpents ([[Exodus]] 7:9 ''et seq.''). During the journey in the wilderness Aaron is not always prominent or active; and he sometimes appears guilty of rebellious or treasonable conduct.  At the battle with [[Amalek]] he is chosen with [[Hur]] to support the hand of [[Moses]] that held the “rod of [[God]]” ([[Exodus]] 17:9 ''et seq.''). When the revelation was given to [[Moses]] at [[Sinai]], he headed the elders of Israel who accompanied [[Moses]] on the way to the summit. [[Joshua]], however, was admitted with his leader to the very presence of [[the Lord]], while Aaron and [[Hur]] remained below to look after the people ([[Exodus]] 24:9-14). It was during the prolonged absence of [[Moses]] that Aaron yielded to the clamors of the people, and made a golden calf as a visible image of the divinity who had delivered them from [[Egypt]] ([[Exodus]] 32:1-6). At the intercession of [[Moses]], Aaron was saved from the plague which smote the people ([[Deuteronomy]] 9:20; [[Exodus]] 32:35), although it was to Aaron’s tribe of [[Levi]] that the work of punitive vengeance was committed ([[Exodus]] 32:26 ''et seq.'').

==Becomes priest of Israel==
At the time when the tribe of [[Levi]] was set apart for the priestly service, Aaron was anointed and consecrated to the priesthood, arrayed in the robes of his office, and instructed in its manifold duties ([[Exodus]] 28 and 29). On the very day of his consecration his sons, [[Nadab|Nadav]] and [[Abihu|Avihu]], were consumed by fire from [[the Lord]] for having offered incense in an unlawful manner ([[Leviticus]] 10).

==Rebellion of [[Korah]]==
From the time of the sojourn at [[Sinai]], where he became the anointed priest of Israel, Aaron ceased to be the minister of [[Moses]], his place being taken by [[Joshua]]. He is mentioned in association with [[Miriam]] in a jealous complaint against the exclusive claims of [[Moses]] as [[the Lord]]’s prophet. The presumption of the murmurers was rebuked, and [[Miriam]] was smitten with ''tzara'as''. Aaron entreated [[Moses]] to intercede for her, at the same time confessing the sin and folly that prompted the uprising. Aaron himself was not struck with the plague on account of sacerdotal immunity; and [[Miriam]], after seven days’ quarantine, was healed and restored to favor ([[Numbers]] 12). It is noteworthy that the prophet [[Micah]] (6:4) mentions [[Moses]], Aaron, and [[Miriam]] as the leaders of Israel after the [[Exodus]] (a judgment wholly in accord with the tenor of the narratives). In the present instance it is made clear by the express words of the oracle ([[Numbers]] 12:6-8) that [[Moses]] was unique among men as the one with whom [[the Lord]] spoke face to face. The failure to recognize or concede this prerogative of their brother was the sin of [[Miriam]] and Aaron. The validity of the exclusive priesthood of the family of Aaron was attested after the ill-fated rebellion of [[Korah]], who was a first cousin of Aaron. When the earth had opened and swallowed up the leaders of the insurgents ([[Numbers]] 16:25-35), [[Eleazar]], the son of Aaron, was commissioned to take charge of the censers of the dead priests. And when the plague had broken out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels, Aaron, at the command of [[Moses]], took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague was stayed ([[Numbers]] 17:1-15, 16:36-50, Authorized Version). Another memorable transaction followed. Each of the tribal princes of Israel took a rod and wrote his name upon it, and the twelve rods were laid up over night in the tent of meeting. On the morrow Aaron’s rod was found to have budded and blossomed and borne ripe almonds ([[Numbers]] 17:8; see [[Aaron’s Rod]]). The miracle proved merely the prerogative of the tribe of [[Levi]]; but now a formal distinction was made in perpetuity between the family of Aaron and the other [[Levites]]. While all the [[Levites]] (and only [[Levites]]) were to be devoted to sacred services, the special charge of the sanctuary and the altar was committed to the Aaronites alone ([[Numbers]] 18:1-7). The scene of this enactment is unknown, nor is the time mentioned.

==Death==
Aaron, like [[Moses]], was not permitted to enter [[Canaan]] with the successful invaders. The reason alleged is that the two brothers showed impatience at Meribah (Kadesh) in the last year of the desert pilgrimage ([[Numbers]] 20:12, 13), when they, or rather [[Moses]], brought water out of a rock to quench the thirst of the people. The action was construed as displaying a want of deference to [[the Lord]], since they had been commanded to speak to the rock, whereas [[Moses]] struck it with the wonder-working rod ([[Numbers]] 20:7-11). Of the death of Aaron we have two accounts. The principal one gives a detailed statement to the effect that, soon after the above incident, Aaron, with his son [[Eleazar]] and [[Moses]], ascended [[Mount Hor]]. There [[Moses]] stripped him (Aaron) of his priestly garments, and transferred them to [[Eleazar]]. Aaron died on the summit of the mountain, and the people mourned for him thirty days ([[Numbers]] 20:22-29; compare 33:38, 39). The other account is found in [[Deuteronomy]] 10:6, where [[Moses]] is reported as saying that Aaron died at [[Mosera]] and was buried there. Some scholars think that [[Mosera]] is not on [[Mount Hor]], since the itinerary in [[Numbers]] 33:31-37 records seven stages between [[Moseroth]] ([[Mosera]]) and [[Mount Hor]].

==Typical signification in apocryphal and rabbinical literature==
The older prophets and prophetical writers beheld in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior to the prophetic truth; men without the spirit of [[God]] and lacking the will-power requisite to resist the multitude in its idolatrous proclivities. Thus Aaron, the typical priest, ranks far below [[Moses]]: he is but his mouthpiece, and the executor of the will of [[God]] revealed through [[Moses]], although it is pointed out (Sifra, Wa-yiḳra, 1) that it is said fifteen times in the Pentateuch that “[[the Lord]] spoke to [[Moses]] ''and'' Aaron.” Under the influence of the priesthood which shaped the destinies of the nation under [[Persians|Persian]] rule, a different ideal of the priest was formed, as is learned from [[Malachi]] 2:4-7; and the prevailing tendency was to place Aaron on a footing equal with [[Moses]]. “At times Aaron, and at other times [[Moses]], is mentioned first in Scripture—this is to show that they were of equal rank,” says Mekilta בא, 1; and [[Ecclesiasticus]] ([[Sirach]]), 44:6-24, expressly infers this when introducing in his record of renowned men the glowing description of Aaron’s ministration.

==[[Moses]] and Aaron compared==
According to Tanḥuma (ed. Buber, 2:12), Aaron’s activity as a prophet began earlier than that of [[Moses]]. The writer of the Testaments of the Patriarchs, however, hesitates to rank [[Moses]] the faithful, “him that speaks with [[God]] as with a father,” as equal with Aaron (Testament of [[Levi]], 8:17). The rabbis are still more emphatic in their praise of Aaron’s virtues. Thus Hillel, who in Herod’s time saw before him mainly a degenerate class of priests, selfish and quarrelsome, held Aaron of old up as a mirror, saying: “Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace; love your fellow creatures and draw them nigh unto the Law!” (Abot, 1:12). This is further illustrated by the tradition preserved in Abot de-Rabbi Natan 12, Sanhedrin 6b, and elsewhere, according to which Aaron was an ideal priest of the people, far more beloved for his kindly ways than was [[Moses]]. While [[Moses]] was stern and uncompromising, brooking no wrong, Aaron went about as peacemaker, reconciling man and wife when he saw them estranged, or a man with his neighbor when they quarreled, and winning evil-doers back into the right way by his friendly intercourse. The mourning of the people at Aaron’s death was greater, therefore, than at that of [[Moses]]; for whereas, when Aaron died the whole house of Israel wept, including the women ([[Numbers]] 20:29), [[Moses]] was bewailed by “the sons of Israel” only ([[Deuteronomy]] 34:8). Even in the making of the Golden Calf the rabbis find extenuating circumstances for Aaron (Sanhedrin 7a). His fortitude and silent submission to the will of [[God]] on the loss of his two sons are referred to as an excellent example to men how to glorify [[God]] in the midst of great affliction (Zebaḥim 115b; [[Josephus]], “[[Antiquities of the Jews]]” 3:8, § 7). Especially significant are the words represented as being spoken by [[God]] after the princes of the [[Twelve Tribes]] had brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared Tabernacle: “Say to thy brother Aaron: Greater than the gifts of the princes is thy gift; for thou art called upon to kindle the light, and, while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the Temple lasts, thy light of the Law shall last forever” (Tanḥuma, ed. Buber, בהעלותך, 6).

==Death of Aaron==
In fulfillment of the promise of peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head ([[Leviticus]] Rabbah 10, Midrash Tehilim 133:1), Aaron’s death, as described in the Haggadah, was of a wonderful tranquillity. Accompanied by [[Moses]], his brother, and by [[Eleazar]], his son, Aaron went to the summit of [[Mount Hor]], where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view. “Take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son [[Eleazar]]!” said [[Moses]]; “and then follow me.” Aaron did as commanded; and they entered the cave, where was prepared a bed around which angels stood. “Go lie down upon thy bed, my brother,” [[Moses]] continued; and Aaron obeyed without a murmur. Then his soul departed as if by a kiss from [[God]]. The cave closed behind [[Moses]] as he left; and he went down the hill with [[Eleazar]], with garments rent, and crying: “Alas, Aaron, my brother! thou, the pillar of supplication of Israel!” When the Israelites cried in bewilderment, “Where is Aaron?” angels were seen carrying Aaron’s bier through the air. A voice was then heard saying: “The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips: he walked with me in righteousness, and brought many back from sin” ([[Malachi]] 2:6, 7). He died, according to Seder ‘Olam R. 9, Rosh ha-Shanah 2, 3a, and [[Josephus]], “[[Antiquities of the Jews]]” 4:4, § 7, on the first of Ab. [[Josephus]] says also that “he died while the multitude looked upon him.” The pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of Israel’s camp disappeared at Aaron’s death (see Seder ‘Olam, 9 and Rosh ha-Shanah 2b-3a). The seeming contradiction between [[Numbers]] 20:22 ''et seq.'' and [[Deuteronomy]] 10:6 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner: Aaron’s death on [[Mount Hor]] was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of Arad, in consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations backward to [[Moseroth|Mosera]], where they performed the rites of mourning for Aaron; wherefore it is said: “There [at [[Moseroth|Mosera]]] died Aaron.” See Mekilta, Beshallaḥ, Wayassa’, 1; Tanḥuma, Huḳḳat, 18; Yerushalmi Soṭah, 1:17c, and Targum Yerushalmi [[Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]] on the above-mentioned passages.
The rabbis also dwell with special laudation on the brotherly sentiment which united Aaron and [[Moses]]. When the latter was appointed ruler and Aaron high priest, neither betrayed any jealousy; instead they rejoiced in one another’s greatness. When [[Moses]] at first declined to go to [[Pharaoh]], saying: “O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send” ([[Exodus]] 4:13), he was unwilling to deprive Aaron, his brother, of the high position the latter had held for so many years; but [[the Lord]] reassured him, saying: “Behold, when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart” ([[Exodus]] 4:14). Indeed, Aaron was to find his reward, says Simon ben Yoḥai; for that heart which had leaped with joy over his younger brother’s rise to glory greater than his was decorated with the Urim and Thummim, which were to “be upon Aaron’s heart when he goeth in before [[the Lord]]” (Canticles Rabbah 1:10). [[Moses]] and Aaron met in gladness of heart, kissing each other as true brothers ([[Exodus]] 4:27; compare [[Song of Songs]], 8:1), and of them it is written: “Behold how good and how pleasant [it is] for brethren to dwell together in unity!” ([[Psalms]] 133:1). Of them it is said ([[Psalms]] 85:10): “Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed [each other]”; for [[Moses]] stood for righteousness, according to [[Deuteronomy]] 33:21, and Aaron for peace, according to [[Malachi]] 2:6. Again, mercy was personified in Aaron, according to [[Deuteronomy]] 33:8, and truth in [[Moses]], according to [[Numbers]] 12:7 (Tanḥuma, Shemot, ed. Buber, 24-26).
When [[Moses]] poured the oil of anointment upon the head of Aaron, Aaron modestly shrank back and said: “Who knows whether I have not cast some blemish upon this sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office.” Then the Holy Spirit spake the words: “Behold the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard of Aaron, that even went down to the skirts of his garment, is as pure as the dew of [[Hermon]]” ([[Psalms]] 133:2, 3, ''Heb''.; Sifra, Shemini, Milluim; Tanḥuma, [[Korah]], ed. Buber, 14). 

==Genetics==
Recently, the tradition that [[Kohanim]] are actually descended from Aaron was supported by [[genetic testing]] (Skorecki et al., 1997). Since all direct male lineage shares a common [[Y chromosome]], testing was done across sectors of the Jewish population to see if there was any commonality between their Y chromosomes. There was proven to be certain distinctions among the [[Cohen modal haplotype]], implying that the Kohanim do share some common ancestry. This information was used to support the claim of the [[Lemba]] (a [[sub-Saharan]] tribe) that they were in fact, a tribe of Jews.

==According to the documentary hypothesis==
The Biblical representation of his character, negative and shadowy compared with Moses's, may be viewed in several ways. A clue to the seemingly contradictory delineations of Aaron (other than the obvious explanation that he is a complex character) is found in the framework of documentary analysis (see also ''[[Hexateuch]]''), which is accepted by some but not all scholars. According to those who accept the [[documentary hypothesis]], the following portions of text belong to (1) [[Elohist|E]], (2) [[Jahwist|J]], (3) [[Deuteronomist|D]], and (4) [[Priestly source|P]] sources, respectively, with the fifth item being from ''[[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]]''.

#'''Aaron as fallible'''. These passages do not represent Aaron as a sacrosanct [[priest]]. He comes to meet Moses (''Exodus'' 4:14), supports him in war (Exodus 17:12) and jurisprudence (Exodus 24:14). He yields to the people and makes the [[Golden Calf|calf]] (Exodus 32), and, with [[Miriam]], [[Snow-white Miriam|criticises Moses]] for marrying a [[Cush]]ite woman. Miriam is subsequently punished (''Numbers'' 12). He is present at the sacrificial covenant meal between [[Israel]] and the [[Kenite]]s (Exodus 18:12). In this aspect, [[Joshua]], instead of Aaron, serves in the Tent (Exodus 33:11).
#'''Aaron as Moses's prophet'''. This representation concerns the covenant meal on [[Sinai]] (Exodus 24:1, 2, 9-11) and the vague charge that Aaron &quot;let the people loose&quot; (Exodus 32:25). Aaron seems to be an afterthought in the plague narrative (Exodus 8:25). In both this and the last view, Moses is the viceregent of God and Aaron is Moses' prophet (Exodus 4:16, 7:1).
#'''Aaron as idolatrous'''. In ''[[Deuteronomy]]'' 9, Aaron is partly responsible for the building of the [[Golden Calf]]. The story says that [[Yahweh]] is so angry toward Aaron that he was about to destroy him. It appears that it is only Moses's intercessory prayer and his destruction of the Golden Calf which saves Aaron. The account of his death in Deuteromy 10:6 is different from that in Numbers 20:22. According to Deuteronomy it occurred at [[Moseroth|Moserah]], seven stations from [[Mount Hor]] (Numbers 33:30), in the early months of the wandering because of the sign of the Golden Calf. The only other passage in reference to Aaron in Deuteronomy merely states that he is the brother of Moses (Deuteronomy 32:50).
#'''Aaron as subordinate'''. The first three, simpler, plagues Aaron brings on at Moses' command; thereafter Moses himself is the actor. In the narratives (Numbers 16, 17) it is Moses in each case who vindicates him. Aaron dies at Mount Hor in the fortieth year of the Exodus (Numbers 20:22, 33:38), because of rebellion at [[Meribah]] (cf. Deuteronomy as above).
#'''Aaron as non-priestly'''. In ''[[Leviticus]]'' 17-26, Aaron appears only in redactional passages connecting the [[Law of Holiness]] with its present context. In ''Ezekiel'' 40-48 Zadok, not Aaron, is the eponym of the priestly line (44:15, etc.).

==In the Qur’an==
In the [[Qur'an]] he is known as [[Harun]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about organic compounds containing -OH groups. For other uses, see [[Alcohol (disambiguation)]].''

In [[chemistry]], '''alcohol''' is any [[organic compound]] in which a [[hydroxyl]] [[Functional group|group]] (''-[[oxygen|O]][[hydrogen|H]]'') is bound to a [[carbon]] atom, which in turn is bound to other [[hydrogen]] and/or [[carbon]] atoms.  The general formula for a simple [[acyclic]] alcohol is '''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+1&lt;/sub&gt;OH'''.

In general usage, '''alcohol''' refers almost always to [[ethanol]], also known as '''grain alcohol''', and often to any beverage that contains ethanol (see ''[[alcoholic beverage]]''). This sense underlies the term [[alcoholism]] ([[addiction]] to alcohol). As a [[Medication|drug]], ethanol is known to have a [[depressant|depressing effect]] that decreases the responses of the [[central nervous system]] (see [[effects of alcohol on the body]]).  Other forms of alcohol are usually described with a clarifying adjective, as in ''[[isopropyl alcohol]]'' or by the suffix ''-ol'', as in ''isopropanol''.

The word dates to the 16th century when it was used to refer to any chemical substance arrived at by sublimation.  This derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''alcohol'' (&quot;powdered ore of [[antimony]]&quot;), originating from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''{{ArabDIN|al-kuḥūl}}'' ({{ar|&amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1603;&amp;#1581;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1604;}}), which is also the source of ''[[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]'' and related to the root ''k-ḥ-l'', attested in the [[Arabic]] word for eye makeup.

== Structure ==
[[Image:alcohol_general.jpg|150px|right|An alcohol]]

The [[functional group]] of an alcohol is a [[hydroxyl group]] bonded to an sp³ hybridized carbon. It can therefore be regarded as a derivative of [[water_(molecule)|water]], with an [[alkyl]] group replacing one of the hydrogens. If an [[aryl]] group is present rather than an alkyl, the compound is generally called a [[phenol]] rather than an alcohol.  Also, if the [[hydroxyl group]] is bonded to one of the sp² hybridized carbons of an alkenyl group, the compound is referred to as an [[enol]].  The oxygen in an alcohol has a bond angle of around 109&amp;deg; (c.f. 104.5&amp;deg; in water), and two nonbonded electron pairs. The O-H bond in methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH) is around 96 pico[[metre]]s long.

=== Primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols ===
There are three major subsets of alcohols- 'primary' (1°), 'secondary' (2°) and 'tertiary' (3°), based upon the number of carbons the C-OH carbon (shown in red) is bonded to. [[Methanol]] is the simplest 'primary' alcohol.  The simplest secondary alcohol is [[isopropanol]] (propan-2-ol), and a simple tertiary alcohol is ''tert''-[[butanol]] (2-methylpropan-2-ol).

[[Image:alcohol_common.jpg|450px|Some common alcohols]]

=== Methanol &amp; ethanol ===
The simplest and most commonly used alcohols are [[methanol]] and [[ethanol]] (common names [[methyl]] alcohol and [[ethyl]] alcohol, respectively), which have the structures shown above.

Methanol was formerly obtained by the distillation of wood, and was called &quot;wood alcohol&quot;.  It is now a cheap commodity chemical produced by the high pressure reaction of [[carbon monoxide]] with [[hydrogen]]. In common usage, &quot;alcohol&quot; often refers simply to ethanol or &quot;grain alcohol&quot;. [[Methylated spirits]] (&quot;Meths&quot;), also called &quot;surgical spirits&quot;, is a form of ethanol rendered undrinkable by the addition of methanol. Aside from its major use in alcoholic beverages, ethanol is also used (though highly controlled) as an industrial solvent and raw material.

== Uses ==
Alcohols are in wide use in industry and science as reagents, [[solvent]]s, and [[alcohol as a fuel|fuel]]s. Ethanol and methanol can be made to burn more cleanly than [[gasoline]] or [[diesel]]. Because of its low toxicity and ability to dissolve non-polar substances, ethanol is often used as a solvent in medical drugs, [[perfume]]s, and vegetable essences such as [[vanilla]]. In [[organic synthesis]], alcohols frequently serve as versatile intermediates.

Ethanol is also commonly used in beverages after fermentation to promote flavor or induce a euphoric intoxication commonly known as &quot;drunkenness&quot; or &quot;being drunk&quot;. The use of ethanol for this purpose is illegal in some jurisdictions. In such instances of consumption, alcohol is a [[Psychoactive drug|drug]], with immediate potential for overdose, toxic poisoning, and physiological dependency (known as [[alcoholism]]). Alcoholism has become one of the most common drug addictions (if not second to caffeine) in the world. The physiological dependency caused by alcoholism means that the user experiences physical withdrawal (in the form of a headache known as a &quot;[[hangover]],&quot; extremely high anxiety known as &quot;the shakes,&quot; and restlessness or trouble sleeping) upon cessation or decrease of use. For the full article on this topic see [[effects of alcohol on the body]].

Because of such particular uses, historically, ethanol has been regulated by taxation. Those who manufacture it for other purposes often avoid this expense by &quot;denaturing&quot; it in a manner that renders it unfit for drinking.  A common way to do this is by the addition of [[denatonium benzoate]]. &quot;SD-40&quot; and &quot;SD Alcohol&quot; sometimes followed by &quot;40-B&quot; are designations that were established by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] for this formulation.

== Sources ==
Many alcohols can be created by [[fermentation]] of [[fruit]]s or [[cereal|grain]]s with [[yeast]], but only ethanol is commercially produced this way, chiefly for [[alcohol as a fuel|fuel]] and [[alcoholic beverage|drink]]. Other alcohols are generally produced by synthetic routes from [[natural gas]], [[petroleum]], or [[coal]] feed stocks, for example via acid catalyzed [[hydration reaction|hydration]] of [[alkene]]s.  For more details see [[#Chemistry of alcohols|Chemistry of alcohols]]

== Nomenclature ==
=== Systematic names ===
In the [[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] system, the name of the alkane chain loses the terminal &quot;e&quot; and adds &quot;ol&quot;, e.g. &quot;methanol&quot; and &quot;ethanol&quot;. When necessary, the position of the hydroxyl group is indicated by a number between the alkane name and the &quot;ol&quot;: [[propan-1-ol]] for CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH, [[Isopropyl alcohol|propan-2-ol]] for CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH(OH)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Sometimes, the position number is written before the IUPAC name: 1-propanol and 2-propanol. If a higher priority group is present (such as an [[aldehyde]], [[ketone]] or [[carboxylic acid]]), then it is necessary to use the prefix &quot;hydroxy&quot;, for example: 1-hydroxy-2-propanone (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH).

Some examples of simple alcohols and how to name them:

[[Image:Alcohol_examples.gif|550px|Examples of alcohols &amp; their names]]

Common names for alcohols usually take the name of the corresponding [[alkyl]] group and add the word &quot;alcohol&quot;, e.g. [[methyl]] alcohol, [[ethyl]] alcohol or [[Butyl|''tert''-butyl]] alcohol.  [[Propyl]] alcohol may be ''n''-propyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol depending on whether the hydroxyl group is bonded to the 1st or 2nd carbon on the propane chain. Isopropyl alcohol is also occasionally called ''sec''-propyl alcohol.

As mentioned above alcohols are classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°) or tertiary (3°), and common names often indicate this in the alkyl group prefix. For example (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COH is a tertiary alcohol is commonly known as ''tert''-butyl alcohol. This would be named 2-methylpropan-2-ol under IUPAC rules, indicating a propane chain with methyl and hydroxyl groups both attached to the middle (#2) carbon.

An alcohol with two hydroxyl groups is commonly called a &quot;glycol&quot;, e.g. HO-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH is [[ethylene glycol]]. The IUPAC name is ethane-1,2-diol, &quot;diol&quot; indicating two hydroxyl groups, and 1,2 indicating their bonding positions. Geminal glycols (with the two hydroxyls on the same carbon atom), such as ethane-1,1-diol, are generally unstable.  For three or four groups, &quot;triol&quot; and &quot;tetraol&quot; are used.

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;alcohol&quot; almost certainly comes from the [[Arabic language]] (the &quot;al-&quot; prefix being the Arabic definite article); however, the precise origin is unclear. It was introduced into [[Europe]], together with the art of [[distillation]] and the substance itself, around the [[12th century]] by various European authors who translated and popularized the discoveries of [[Islamic]] [[alchemy|alchemists]].

A popular theory, found in many dictionaries, is that it comes from &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1603;&amp;#1581;&amp;#1604; = ''ALKHL'' = ''al-kuhul'', originally the name of very finely powdered [[antimony]] [[sulfide]] [[antimony|Sb]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[sulfur|S]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; used as an [[antiseptic]] and [[eyeliner]]. The powder is prepared by [[sublimation (physics)|sublimation]] of the natural mineral [[stibnite]] in a closed vessel.  According to this theory, the meaning of ''alkuhul'' would have been first extended to distilled substances in general, and then narrowed to ethanol. This conjectured etymology has been circulating in England since [[1672]] at least ([[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]).

However, this derivation is suspicious since the current Arabic name for alcohol,  &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1603;&amp;#1581;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1604; = ''ALKHWL'' = ''al???'', does not derive from ''al-kuhul''. The [[Qur'an]] in verse 37:47 uses the word &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1594;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1604; = ''ALGhWL'' = ''al-ghawl'' &amp;mdash; properly meaning &quot;spirit&quot; (&quot;[[spiritual being]]&quot;) or &quot;[[demon]]&quot; &amp;mdash; with the sense &quot;the thing that gives the wine its headiness&quot;. The word ''al-ghawl'' also originated the [[English language|English]] word &quot;ghoul&quot;, and the name of the star [[Algol]]. This derivation would, of course, be consistent with the use of &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;spirit of wine&quot; as synonymous of &quot;alcohol&quot; in most Western languages.  (Incidentally, the etymology &quot;alcohol&quot; = &quot;the devil&quot; was used in the [[1930s]] by the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Temperance movement|Temperance Movement]] for propaganda purposes.)

According to the second theory, the popular etymology and the spelling &quot;alcohol&quot; would not be due to generalization of the meaning of ''ALKHL'', but rather to Western alchemists and authors confusing the two words ''ALKHL'' and ''ALGhWL'', which have indeed been transliterated in many different and overlapping ways.

== Physical and chemical properties ==
The [[hydroxyl group]] generally makes the alcohol molecule [[polar molecule|polar]]. Those groups can form [[hydrogen bond]]s to one another and to other compounds. Two opposing solubility trends in alcohols are: the tendency of the polar OH to promote solubility in water, and of the carbon chain to resist it. Thus, methanol, ethanol, and propanol are miscible in water because the hydroxyl group wins out over the short carbon chain. [[Butanol]], with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble because of a balance between the two trends.  Alcohols of five or more carbons ([[amyl alcohol|Pentanol]] and higher) are effectively insoluble because of the hydrocarbon chain's dominance.

Because of [[hydrogen bonding]], alcohols tend to have higher boiling points than comparable [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[ether]]s. All simple alcohols are miscible in organic solvents. This hydrogen bonding means that alcohols can be used as [[protic solvent]]s.

The lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen of the hydroxyl group also makes alcohols nucleophiles.

Alcohols, like water, can show either acidic or basic properties at the O-H group.  With a [[pKa|pK&lt;Sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of around 16-19 they are generally slightly weaker [[acid]]s than [[water (molecule)|water]], but they are still able to react with strong bases such as [[sodium hydride]] or reactive metals such as [[sodium]].  The salts that result are called '''[[alkoxide]]s''', with the general formula [[Alkyl|R]]O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; [[Metal|M]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Alcohols conjugated to aromatic rings have a lower pKa (around 10). Electron-withdrawing groups also work to make alcohols more acidic. For example, Para-nitro phenol has a pKa of 7.15.

Meanwhile the oxygen atom has [[lone pair]]s of nonbonded electrons that render it weakly [[Base_(chemistry)|basic]] in the presence of strong acids such as [[sulfuric acid]].  For example, with methanol:

[[Image:methanol_acid_base.gif|500px|Acidity &amp; basicity of methanol]]

Alcohols can also undergo [[oxidation]] to give [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s or [[carboxylic acid]]s, or they can be dehydrated to [[alkene]]s.  They can react to form [[ester compound]]s, and they can (if activated first) undergo [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions. For more details see the [[#Chemistry of alcohols]] section below.

== Toxicity ==
Alcohols often have an odor described as 'biting' that 'hangs' in the nasal passages. [[Ethanol]] in the form of [[alcoholic beverage]]s has been consumed by humans since pre-historic times, for a variety of hygienic, dietary, medicinal, religious, and recreational reasons. While infrequent consumption of ethanol in small quantities may be harmless or even beneficial, larger doses result in a state known as [[drunkenness]] or intoxication and, depending on the dose and regularity of use, can cause acute respiratory failure or death and with chronic use has medical repercussions.

Other alcohols are substantially more poisonous than ethanol, partly because they take much longer to be metabolized, and often their metabolism produces even more toxic substances. Methanol, or ''wood alcohol'', for instance, is oxidized by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] [[enzyme]]s in the liver to the poisonous [[formaldehyde]], which can cause blindness or death. 

An effective treatment to prevent formaldehyde toxicity after methanol ingestion is to administer ethanol. This will bind to alcohol dehydrogenase, preventing methanol from binding and thus acting as a [[substrate]]. Any formaldehyde will be converted to [[formic acid]] and excreted before it causes damage.

==  Preparation of alcohols ==
=== Laboratory ===
Several methods exist for the preparation of alcohols in the laboratory.
* Primary [[Alkyl halide]]s react with aqueous [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]] mainly to primary alcohols in [[nucleophilic aliphatic substitution]]. (Secondary and especially tertiary alkyl halides will give the elimination (alkene) product instead).
* [[Aldehydes]] or [[ketone]]s are [[reduction|reduced]] with [[sodium borohydride]] or [[lithium aluminium hydride]]. (after an acidic workup)
* [[Alkenes]] engage in a [[acid]] catalysed [[hydration reaction]] using concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] as a catalyst which gives usually secondary or tertiary alcohols.
* The [[hydroboration-oxidation]] and [[oxymercuration-reduction]] of alkenes are more reliable in organic synthesis.
* [[Grignard reagent]]s react with [[carbonyl]] groups to secondary and tertiary alcohols

The formation of a secondary alcohol via reduction and hydratation is shown:

[[Image:alcohol_prep.gif|center|350px|Preparation of a secondary alcohol]]

=== Industrial ===
Industrially alcohols are produced in several ways.
* by [[fermentation]] using [[glucose]] produced from sugar from the [[hydrolysis]] of [[starch]], in the presence of yeast and temperature of less than 37°C to produce ethanol. For instance the conversion of [[invertase]] to [[glucose]] and [[fructose]] or the conversion of [[glucose]] to [[zymase]] and [[ethanol]].
* By direct [[hydration reaction|hydration]]: using [[ethene]] or other alkenes from [[cracking]] of fractions of distilled [[crude oil]]. Uses a catalyst of [[phosphoric acid]] under high temperature and pressure.
* [[Methanol]] is producted from water gas: It is manufactured from [[Syngas|synthesis gas]], where [[carbon monoxide]] and 2 equivalents of hydrogen gas are combined to produce [[methanol]] using a [[copper]], [[zinc oxide]] and [[aluminium oxide]] catalyst at 250°C and a pressure of 50-100 atm.

== Reactions of alcohols ==
=== Deprotonation ===
Alcohols can behave as weak acids, undergoing deprotonation. The deprotonation reaction to produce an [[alkoxide]] salt is either performed with a strong base such as [[sodium hydride]] or [[butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]], or with sodium or potassium metal.

: 2 R-OH + 2 [[Sodium hydride|NaH]]  &amp;rarr;  2 R-O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  [[Hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]&amp;uarr;

: 2 R-OH + 2[[Sodium|Na]] &amp;rarr; 2R-O&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

: e.g. 2 [[Ethanol|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH]] + 2 Na  &amp;rarr;  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Water is similar in [[pKa|pK&lt;Sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] to many alcohols, so with [[sodium hydroxide]] there is an equilibrium set up which usually lies to the left:

: R-OH + [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]]  &lt;=&gt;  R-O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (equilibrium to the left)

It should be noted, though, that the bases used to deprotonate alcohols are strong themselves. The bases used and the alkoxides created are both highly moisture sensitive chemical reagents.

=== Nucleophilic substitution ===
The [[hydroxyl|OH]] group is not a good [[leaving group]] in [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions.  However if the oxygen is first protonated to give R&amp;minus;OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the leaving group ([[water_(molecule)|water]]) is much more stable, and nucleophilic substitution can take place.  For instance, tertiary alcohols react with [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce tertiary [[alkyl halide]]s, where the [[hydroxyl group]] is replaced by a [[chlorine]] atom.  If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with [[hydrochloric acid]], an activator such as [[zinc chloride]] is needed.  Alternatively  the conversion may be performed directly using [[thionyl chloride]].&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Image:Alcohol_reaction_examples.gif|550px|Some simple conversions of alcohols to alkyl chlorides]]

Alcohols may likewise be converted to alkyl bromides using [[hydrobromic acid]] or [[phosphorus tribromide]], for example:

: 3 R-OH  +  PBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;rarr;  3 RBr  +  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

In the [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]] an alcohol is deoxygenated to an [[alkane]] with [[organotin|tributyltin hydride]] or a [[organoborane|trimethylborane]]-water complex in a [[radical substitution]] reaction.

=== Dehydration ===
Alcohols are themselves nucleophilic, so R&amp;minus;OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can react with ROH to produce [[ether]]s and water in a [[dehydration reaction]], although this reaction is rarely used except in the manufacture of [[diethyl ether]].

More useful is the E1 [[elimination reaction]] of alcohols to produce [[alkene]]s.  The reaction generally obeys [[Zaitsev's Rule]], which states that the most stable (usually the most substituted) alkene is formed.  Tertiary alcohols eliminate easily at just above room temperature, but primary alcohols requre a higher temperature.

This is a diagram of acid catalysed dehydration of ethanol to produce [[ethene]]:

[[image:DehydrationOfAlcoholWithH-.png|550px]]

=== Esterification ===
To form an [[ester]] from an [[alcohol]] and a [[carboxylic acid]] the reaction, known as [[Fischer esterification]], is usually performed at [[reflux]] with a [[catalyst]] of concentrated [[sulfuric acid]]:

: R-OH  +  R'-COOH  &lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;  R'-COOR  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In order to drive the equilibrium to the right and produce a good [[yield_(chemistry)|yield]] of ester, water is usually removed, either by an excess of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or by using a [[Dean-Stark apparatus]].  Esters may also be prepared by reaction of the alcohol with an [[acid chloride]] in the presence of a base such as [[pyridine]].

Other types of ester are prepared similarly- for example [[tosyl]] (tosylate) esters are made by reaction of the alcohol with p-[[toluenesulfonyl]] chloride in pyridine.

=== Oxidation===
Primary alcohols generally give [[aldehyde]]s or [[carboxylic acid]]s upon [[organic oxidation|oxidation]], while secondary alcohols give [[ketone]]s. Traditionally strong [[Redox|oxidants]] such as the [[dichromate]] ion or [[potassium permanganate]] are used, under acidic conditions, for example:

:3 [[Isopropanol|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH(-OH)-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]  +  [[Potassium dichromate|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]]  +  4 [[Sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]  &amp;rarr;  3 [[Acetone|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C(=O)-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]  +  Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  7 [[Water_(molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]

Frequently in [[aldehyde]] preparations these reagents cause a problem of over-oxidation to the [[carboxylic acid]]. To avoid this, other reagents such as [[Pyridinium chlorochromate|PCC]], [[Dess-Martin periodinane]], [[2-Iodoxybenzoic acid]], [[TPAP]] or methods such as [[Swern oxidation]] are now preferred.

Alcohols with a [[methyl]] group attached to the alcohol carbon can also undergo a [[haloform reaction]] (such as the [[iodoform reaction]]) in the presence of the [[halogen]] and a base such as sodium hydroxide.

Tertiary alcohols resist oxidation, but can be oxidised by reagents such as 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone.

[[Image:Achill_Ireland_Keem_bay.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Keem bay on Achill island is said to be one of the most beautiful beaches in Ireland.]]

'''Achill Island''' ''([[Irish language|Irish]]; Acaill, Oileán Acla)'' in [[County Mayo]] is the largest island off [[Ireland]], and is situated off the west coast. It has a population of 2700. Its area is 57 [[square miles]] (146 [[square kilometres]]). Achill is attached to the mainland by [[Michael Davitt Bridge]], between the villages of [[Achill Sound]] and Polranny, so it is possible to drive onto the island. This is a [[swing bridge]] which allows the passage of small boats. A bridge was first completed here in 1886, and replaced by the current structure after [[World War II]]. Other centres of population include the villages of Keel, Dooagh, Dooega and Dugort. The island's [[Gaelic football|football]] pitch and two secondary schools are on the mainland at Polranny. Early settlements are believed to have been established on Achill around 3000 BCE. A paddle dating from this period was found at the [[crannog]] near Dookinella.

The island is 87 per cent [[peat bog]]. The parish of Achill also includes the Corraun peninsula. The people of Corraun consider themselves Achill people, and most natives of Achill refer to this area as being &quot;in Achill&quot;. In the summer of 1996, the [[RNLI]] decided to station a [[lifeboat]] at Kildownet.

==History==
It is believed that at the end of the [[Neolithic Period]] (around 4000 BCE), Achill had a population of 500-1000 people. The island would have been mostly forest until the Neolithic people began crop cultivation. Settlememt increased during the [[Iron Age]], and the dispersal of small forts around the coast indicate the warlike nature of the times. [[Grace O'Malley|Granuaile]] maintained a castle at Kildownet in the [[sixteenth century]].

In the [[seventeenth century|seventeenth]] and [[eighteenth century|eighteenth]] centuries, there was much migration to Achill from other parts of Ireland, particularly [[Ulster]], due to the political and religious turmoil of the time. For a while there were two different [[dialect]]s of [[Irish language|Irish]] being spoken on Achill. This led to many townlands being recorded as having two names during the 1824 Ordnace Survey, and some maps today give different names for the same place. Achill Irish still has many traces of [[Ulster Irish]].

==Sights==
[[Image:Atlantic Drive.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Overlooking the west coast of Achill Island.]]
Despite some unsympathetic development, the island retains some striking natural beauty.  The cliffs of Croaghaun on the northern coast of the island are the highest sea cliffs in [[Europe]] but are inaccessible by road.  On the western tip near Achill Head, Keem bay is arguably one of the most beautiful beaches on the Irish west coast. [[Image:Achill_Ireland_Keel.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Keel Strand.]]Keel beach is quite popular with tourists and some locals as a [[surfing]] location. Another extreme point of the island is Moytoge Head, which with its rounded appearance drops dramatically down to the ocean. An old [[United_Kingdom|British]] observation post, built during [[World War I]] to prevent the [[Germany|Germans]] landing arms for the [[Irish Republican Army]] separatist movement, is still standing on Moytoge. The mountain Slievemore (671 metres) rises dramatically in the centre of the island and the Atlantic drive (along the south/west of the island) has some dramatically beautiful views. On the slopes of Slievemore, there is an abandoned village (&quot;The Deserted Village&quot;) The Deserted Village at Slievemore was once thought to be a remnant village from An Gorta Mór (The Great Hunger, see [[Great Famine]]).  However, recent developments suggest that it is a Booley.  Specifically, the people of Dooagh and Pollagh would migrate in the summer to Slievemore ([[Transhumance]]), and then go back to Dooagh in the fall. Just west of the deserted village is an old [[Martello tower]], again built by the British to warn of any possible [[France|French]] invasion. The area also boasts an approximately 5000-year old [[Neolithic tomb]]. Achillbeg (''Acaill Beag'', Little Achill) is a small island just off Achill's southern tip. Its inhabitants were resettled on Achill in the 1960's. There is a mural of a surfer on the gable of a pub in [[Cashel (Achill)|Cashel]].

==Economy==
While a number of attempts at setting up small industrial units on the island have been made, the economy of the island is largely dependent on [[tourism]]. Subventions from Achill people working abroad, in particular in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and the [[United States]] allowed many families to remain living in Achill throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Since the advent of [[Ireland]]'s &quot;[[Celtic Tiger]]&quot; [[Economy of Ireland|economy]] fewer Achill people are forced to look for work abroad. [[Agriculture]] plays a small role and is only profitable because of European subsidies. The fact that the island is mostly bog means that it is limited - largely to [[sheep farming]]. In the past, [[fishing]] was a significant activity but this aspect of the economy is small now. At one stage, the island was known for its shark fishing, [[basking shark]] in particular was fished for its valuable liver oil. There was a big spurt of growth in tourism in the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]] before which life was tough and difficult on the island.  Since that heyday, the common perception is that tourism has been slowly declining.

==Architecture==
[[Image:Achill_Slievemore_Deserted_Village.jpg|250px|thumb|The &quot;Deserted Village&quot; at the foot of Slievemore was a Booley village, see [[Transhumance]]]]

Some of the recent building development on the island (over the last 40 years or so) has been contentious and in many cases is not as sympathetic to the landscape as the earlier style of [[whitewash|whitewashed]] [[barged roof]]ed [[cottage]]s.  Because of the inhospitable climate, very few houses date from before the [[20th century|twentieth century]].  An example of the style of earlier housing can be seen in the &quot;Deserted Village&quot; ruins near the graveyard at the foot of Slievemore.  Even the houses in this village represent a relatively comfortable class of dwelling as, even as recently as a hundred years ago, some people still used &quot;Beehive&quot; style houses (small circular single roomed dwellings with a hole in ceiling to let out smoke).  Many of the oldest and most picturesque inhabitated cottages date from the activities of the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland]] - a body set up around the turn of the twentieth century in Ireland to improve the welfare for inhabitants of small villages and towns.  Most of the homes in Achill at the time were very small and tightly packed together in villages.  The CDB subsidised the building of new, more spacious (though still small by modern standards) homes outside of the traditional villages.

==Famous people==
The artist [[Paul Henry (painter)|Paul Henry]] stayed on the island for a number of years in the early 1900s and some of his most famous paintings are of the dramatic landscape of the island. The [[Nobel Prize]] winning author, [[Heinrich Böll]], visited the island and wrote of his experience in his &quot;Irish Journal&quot; (''Irisches Tagebuch''). The Bölls later bought a cottage near Dugort and lived in it periodically until 2001 when they donated it to be used as an artists' residence. [[Graham Greene]] also spent time on Achill Island.

'''Irwin Allen Ginsberg''' ({{IPA2|ˈgɪnzˌbɝg}}) ([[June 3]], [[1926]] &amp;ndash; [[April 5]] [[1997]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[Beat poet]] born in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. Ginsberg is best known for [[Howl]] ([[1956]]), a long poem about [[consumer]] [[society]]'s negative [[Values#Personal and cultural values|human values]].

==Life==

Ginsberg was born on [[June 3]], [[1926]] into a Jewish family in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. His father [[Louis Ginsberg]] was a poet and his mother was a high school teacher. Ginsberg's mother, Naomi Levy Ginsberg (who was affected by [[epileptic seizures]] and [[mental illness]]es such as [[paranoia]] {{ref|Modern}}) was also an active member of the [[Communist Party USA]] and often took Ginsberg and his brother Eugene to party meetings. Ginsberg later said that his mother &quot;Made up bedtime stories that all went something like: 'The good king rode forth from his castle, saw the suffering workers and healed them.'&quot;{{ref|BioProject}}

As a teenager, Ginsberg began to write letters to ''The [[New York Times]]'' about political issues such as [[World War II]] and workers' rights.{{ref|BioProject2}} When he was a junior in high school, he accompanied his mother by bus to her therapist. The trip disturbed Ginsberg and he later described it, along with his relationship with his mother, in his long autobiographical poem ''[[Kaddish (poem)|''Kaddish for Naomi Ginsberg (1894-1956)]].''{{ref|Modern2}} 

In 1943 Ginsberg graduated from high school and briefly attended [[Montclair State University]] before entering [[Columbia University]] on a scholarship from the [[Young Men's Hebrew Association]] of Paterson. ([[1949]])[http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/04/08/specials/ginsberg-obit.html]. In his freshman year he met fellow undergraduate [[Lucien Carr]], who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers including [[Jack Kerouac]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[John Clellon Holmes]]. Carr also introduced Ginsberg to [[Neal Cassady]], one of the many that Ginsberg loved. Kerouac later described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady in the first chapter of his 1957 novel ''[[On the Road]].''{{ref|Modern3}}

In [[1954]] Ginsberg met [[Peter Orlovsky]], a young man of 21 with whom he fell in love and who remained his life-long lover, and with whom he eventually shared his interest in Tibetan Buddhism. Later in his life, Ginsberg formed a bridge between the [[Beat_generation|Beat]] movement of the [[1950s]] and the [[hippies]] of the [[1960s]], befriending, among others, [[Timothy Leary]], [[Gregory Corso]], [[Bob Kaufman]], [[Herbert Huncke]], [[Rod McKuen]], and [[Bob Dylan]]. 

In 1965 Ginsberg was deported from Cuba for for publicaly protesting against Cuba's anti-marijuana stance and its penchant for throwing homosexuals in jail.

The Cubans sent him to Czechoslovakia, Where one week after being named the King of a May Day parade, Ginsberg was labeled an &quot;immoral menace&quot; by the Czech government and deported.

In 1982, he was featured on &quot;Ghetto Defendant&quot;, a song by [[The Clash]], on their album &quot;[[Combat Rock]]&quot;. Ginsberg died of cancer on [[April 5]], [[1997]].

==Career==

Ginsberg's [[poetry]] was strongly influenced by [[modernism]], [[romanticism]], the beat and cadence of [[jazz]], and his [[Kagyu]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practice and [[Jew]]ish background. He considered himself to have inherited the visionary and [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] poetic mantle handed from the English poet and artist [[William Blake]] on to [[Walt Whitman]]. The power of Ginsberg's verse, its searching, probing focus, its long and lilting lines, as well as its New World exuberance, all echo the continuity of inspiration which he claimed. Other influences included the American poet [[William Carlos Williams]]. 

Ginsberg's principal work, &quot;[[Howl]]&quot;, is well-known to many for its opening line: &quot;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness&quot;.  It was considered scandalous at the time of publication due to the rawness of the language, which is frequently explicit.  Shortly after its [[1956]] publication by [[San Francisco]]'s [[City Lights Bookstore]], it was banned for obscenity. The ban became a [[cause célèbre]] among defenders of the [[First Amendment]], and was later lifted after judge Clayton W. Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming social importance. Ginsberg's [[leftist]] and generally anti-establishment politics attracted the attention of the [[FBI]], who regarded Ginsberg as a major security threat. [[Image:Ginsberg.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Allen Ginsberg]]

Ginsberg's spiritual journey began early on with his reported spontaneous visions, and continued with an early trip to [[India]] and a chance encounter on a New York City street (they both tried to catch the same cab) with [[Chögyam Trungpa]], Rinpoche, a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] meditation master of the [[Vajrayana]] school, who became his friend and life-long teacher. Ginsberg helped found the [[Jack Kerouac]] School of Disembodied Poetics at [[Naropa University]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]], a school founded by Chögyam Trungpa, Rinpoche. Music and chanting were both important parts of his live delivery during poetry readings. He often accompanied himself on a handheld organ called a harmonium, and was often accompanied by a guitarist. Attendance to his poetry readings was generally standing room only for most of his career, no matter where in the world he appeared. 

Ginsberg won the National Book Award for his book &quot;The Fall of America.&quot; In 1993, the French Minister of Culture awarded him with the medal of [[Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres]] (the Order of Arts and Letters).

In [[1994]], when the [[International Lesbian and Gay Association]] successfully banished all connections to the [[North American Man-Boy Love Association]] in order to gain consultative status in the United Nations, Ginsberg opposed (together with modern gay rights founder [[Harry Hay]]). He said that he supported NAMBLA's right to [[free speech]] because the hysteria over [[pederasty]] reminded him of the hysteria over homosexuality itself while he was growing up. While his poetry praised the love of youths, his interests lay mostly in young men above the age of consent.

==Quotations==

* &quot;Our goal was to save the planet and alter human consciousness.  That will take a long time, if it happens at all.&quot;
* &quot;Poetry is not an expression of the party line. It's that time of night, lying in bed, thinking what you really think, making the private world public, that's what the poet does.&quot;
* &quot;Pot is fun.&quot;
* &quot;The only thing that can save the world is the reclaiming of the awareness of the world. That's what poetry does.&quot;
* &quot;Master thyself and others will follow.&quot;
* &quot;First thought, best thought.&quot; (referring to his, and other Beat writers' unique style of writing poetry)
* &quot;The CIA and the Mafia are in cahoots&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''algebraically closed''' if every [[polynomial]] in one variable of degree at least &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, with [[coefficient]]s in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, has a [[root (mathematics)|zero]] ([[root (mathematics)|root]]) in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

As an example, the field of [[real number]]s is not algebraically closed, because the polynomial equation

:&lt;math&gt;3x^2+1=0&lt;/math&gt;

has no solution in real numbers, even though both of its coefficients (&lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;) are real. The same argument proves that the field of [[rational number]]s is not algebraically closed. Also, no [[finite field]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is algebraically closed, because if &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;hellip;, &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; are the elements of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, then the polynomial 

:&lt;math&gt;(x-a_1)(x-a_2)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(x-a_n)+1&lt;/math&gt;

has no zero in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. By contrast, the field of [[complex number]]s is algebraically closed: this is stated by the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]]. Another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of [[algebraic number]]s.

Given a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, the assertion &amp;ldquo;&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is algebraically closed&amp;rdquo; is equivalent to each one of the following:

* Every polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, with [[coefficient]]s in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, [[Factorization|splits into linear factors]]. In other words, there are elements &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; such that
::&lt;math&gt;p(x)=k(x-x_1)(x-x_2)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(x-x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

* The field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; has no proper [[algebraic extension]].

* For each natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, every [[Linear map|linear map]] from &lt;math&gt;F^n&lt;/math&gt; into itself has some [[Eigenvector|eigenvector]].

* Every [[Rational function|rational function]] in one variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, with coefficients in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form &lt;math&gt;a/(x-b)^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are elements of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an algebraically closed field, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number, then &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; has an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; root in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, since this is the same thing as saying that the equation &lt;math&gt;x^n-a=0&lt;/math&gt; has some root in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. However, there are fields in which every element has an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; root (for each natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) but which are not algebraically closed. In fact, even assuming that every polynomial of the form &lt;math&gt;x^n-a&lt;/math&gt; splits into linear factors is not enough to assure that the field is algebraically closed.

Every field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; has an &quot;[[algebraic closure]]&quot;, which is the smallest algebraically closed field of which &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a subfield.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Anatoly Karpov.jpg|thumb|right|Anatoly Karpov]]
'''Anatoli Yevgenyevich Karpov''' (Анато́лий Евге́ньевич Ка́рпов) (born [[May 23]], [[1951]]) is a [[Russia]]n [[chess]] [[International Grandmaster|grandmaster]] and former [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]]. He is the most successful tournament player of all time, and as of July 2005 he has 161 first-place finishes to his credit.  From 1978 to 1998 he played in every [[FIDE]] World Championship match. His overall professional record is 1,118 wins, 287 losses, and 1,480 draws in 3,163 games. His peak [[ELO rating system|ELO rating]] is 2780.

==Grandmaster==

Karpov was born on May 23, 1951 in [[Zlatoust]] in the former [[Soviet Union]] and learned to play chess at the age of 4. At age 12 he was accepted into [[Mikhail Botvinnik]]'s prestigious chess school.  Ironically, Botvinnik had this to say about a young Karpov: &quot;The boy doesn't have a clue about chess, and there's no future at all for him in this profession.&quot;{{fact}}  Karpov proved him wrong by becoming the youngest [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] National Master in history at 15, and won in his first international chess tournament several months later. In 1967 he took 5th in the [[Soviet Junior Chess Championship]] and won the [[European Junior Chess Championship]] later that same year. In 1969 he became the first Soviet player since [[Boris Spassky]] (1955) to win the [[World Junior Chess Championship]] with a score of 10 out of 11. Soon afterwards he tied for 4th place at an international tournament in [[Caracas, Venezuela]] and became the world's youngest [[International Grandmaster|Grandmaster]].

==Candidate==

The 1970s showed a major improvement in his game. His [[ELO rating system|ELO rating]] shot up from 2540 in 1971 to 2660 in 1973, when he came in 2nd in the [[USSR Chess Championship]] and placed first in the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] [[Interzonal]] Tournament. The latter qualified him for the 1974 Candidates cycle, which determined who was allowed to challenge the reigning World Champion, [[Bobby Fischer]].

Karpov beat [[Lev Polugaevsky]] by +3=5 in the first Candidates match to face former World Champion [[Boris Spassky]] in the next round. Karpov was on record saying that he believed Spassky would easily beat him and win the Candidates cycle to face Fischer, and that he (Karpov) would win the following Candidates cycle in 1977.

Most expected the Spassky-Karpov match to be a one-sided rout by the ex-champ Spassky. Although Spassky won the first game as black in good style, tenacious and aggressive play from Karpov secured him a win +4-1=6. Karpov was certainly not hurt by the fact that Spassky's chief opening analyst, 1955 [[USSR Chess Championship|Soviet Champion]] [[Efim Geller]], defected to Karpov's side several months before the match.

The Candidates final was against fellow Russian [[Viktor Korchnoi]], a notable fighting player. Intense games were fought, including one &quot;opening laboratory&quot; win against the [[Sicilian Defense|Sicilian Dragon]].  Karpov went 3&amp;ndash;0 up but tired towards the end and allowed Korchnoi two wins, but Karpov prevailed +3-2=19.  Thus he won the right to challenge Fischer for the World Championship.

Though the world championship match between the young Soviet prodigy and the incomparably dominant American Fischer was highly anticipated, the match never came about. Fischer drew up a list of ten demands, chief among them the provisions that draws wouldn't count, the first to ten victories wins, and if the score was tied 9&amp;ndash;9 the champion would retain the crown. This means that candidate needed two wins more than the reigning champion because narrowest possible win for him is 10&amp;ndash;8. The [[Fédération Internationale des Échecs|International Chess Federation]] (FIDE) flatly refused at first, but eventually conceded the first two. However, Fischer demanded all or nothing, and when FIDE refused to give into the third demand, Fischer resigned his crown, to the huge disappointment of the chess world. Karpov later attempted to set up another match with Fischer, but all the negotiations fell through. Fischer never did play Karpov (or [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]], for that matter) and scorned them as inferior players. This thrust the young Karpov into the role of World Champion without defeating the reigning champion, which lead some chess pundits to accuse Karpov of being a &quot;paper world champion&quot;&amp;mdash;that he had earned the title in a ceremony, but not over a chessboard.

When Kasparov was in a bitter struggle for the world championship with Karpov, he often reminded others that Karpov won the title by default.  But while preparing a monumental book series ''Kasparov: On My Great Predecessors'', Kasparov argued that Karpov would have had the better chances, because he had beaten Spassky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional, and indeed had higher quality games, while Fischer had been inactive for three years.  Critics argue that Kasparov was trying to boost his own prestige by boosting that of the man he defeated.  Spassky thought that Fischer would have won in 1975 but Karpov would have qualified again and beaten Fischer in 1978{{fact}}.  [[Zsuzsa Polgar]] thinks Fischer would have won very narrowly in 1975 due to his greater experience.[http://www.chesscafe.com/text/polgar26.pdf]

==World champion==

Shamed that he had become the twelfth world champion in this manner, and desperately trying to prove he was worthy of the crown, Karpov participated in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years. He created the most phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world the chess world had ever seen. This tournament success even eclipsed the pre-war tournament record of [[Alexander Alekhine]]. He held the record for most consecutive tournament victories (9) until it was shattered by [[Garry Kasparov]] (14).

In 1978, Karpov's first title defence was against Viktor Korchnoi, the opponent he defeated in the previous Candidates tournament. The situation was vastly different from the previous match, because in the intervening years Korchnoi had defected from the Soviet Union. The match was played in [[Baguio]] in the [[Philippines]], and a vast array of psychological tricks were used during the match, from Karpov's Dr. Zukhar who attempted to hypnotize Korchnoi during the game, to Korchnoi's mirror glasses to ward off the hypnotic stare, Korchnoi's offering to play under the [[Jolly Roger]] flag when he was denied the right to play under [[Switzerland]]'s, to Karpov's yogurt supposedly being used to send him secret messages, to Korchnoi inviting two local cult members (on trial for [[attempted murder]]) into the hall as members of his team.

The off-board antics are better remembered than the actual chess match. Karpov took an early lead, but Korchnoi staged an amazing comeback very late in the match, and came very close to winning. Karpov narrowly won the last game to take the match 6&amp;ndash;5, with 21 draws.

Three years later Korchnoi re-emerged as the Candidates winner against [[Germany|German]] finalist Dr. [[Robert Huebner]] to challenge Karpov in [[Merano]], [[Italy]]. This time the psychological trick was the arrest of Korchnoi's son for evading [[conscription]]. Again the politics off the board overshadowed the games, but this time Karpov easily won (11&amp;ndash;7, +6 -2 =10) in what is remembered to be the &quot;Massacre of Merano&quot;.

Karpov's tournament career also reached a peak at the exceptional [[Montreal]] &quot;Super-Grandmaster&quot; tournament in 1979, where he ended joint first with [[Mikhail Tal]] ahead of a field of superb grandmasters like [[Jan Timman]], [[Ljubomir Ljubojevic]], [[Boris Spassky]], and [[Lubomir Kavalek]]. Meanwhile, he had also won the prestigious [[Linares chess tournament|Linares tournament]] in 1981 (and again in 1994), the [[Tilburg]] tournament in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1982, and 1983, and the [[USSR Chess Championship|Soviet Championship]] in 1976 and 1983 (and again in 1988).

To illustrate Karpov's dominance over his peers as champion, his score was +11 -2 =20 v Spassky, +5 =12 v [[Robert Hübner]], +6 -1 = 16 v [[Ulf Andersson]], +3 -1 =10 v [[Vasily Smyslov]], +1 =16 v [[Mikhail Tal]], +10 -2 =13 v Ljubojevic.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Karkas1.jpg|thumbnail|The 1984 [[World Chess Championship]] was between [[Garry Kasparov]] (left) and Anatoly Karpov (right).]] --&gt;

Karpov had cemented his position as the world's best player and world champion when [[Garry Kasparov]] arrived on the scene. In their first World Championship match in 1984, Karpov quickly built a 4&amp;ndash;0 lead, and needed only two more wins to keep his title. Instead, the next 17 games were drawn, and it took Karpov until Game 27 to finally win another game. In Game 31, Karpov had a winning position but failed to take advantage and settled for a draw. He lost the next game, but drew the next 14. In particular, Karpov held a solidly winning position in Game 41, but again blundered terribly and had to settle for a draw. After Kasparov suddenly won Game 47 and 48, Karpov suffered a physical collapse, having lost 10 kg (22 lb) over the course of the match. The FIDE President controversially terminated the match, which had lasted an unprecedented four months with five wins for Karpov, three for Kasparov, and a staggering forty draws. A rematch was set for the following year. In a hard fight, Karpov lost his title 11 to 13 in the 1985 match, ending his ten-year reign as champion.

==Rival==

Karpov remained a formidable opponent for most of the [[1980s|eighties]]. He fought Kasparov in three more World Championship matches in 1986 (held in [[London]] and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]), 1987 (held in [[Seville]]), and 1990 (held in [[Lyon]] and [[New York City]]). All three matches were extremely close (the scores were 12.5 to 11.5, 12 to 12, and 12.5 to 11.5). In all three matches Karpov had winning chances up to the very last games. In particular, the 1987 Seville match featured an astonishing blunder by Kasparov in the 23rd game, and should have led to Karpov's winning the title. Instead, in the final game, needing only a draw to win the title, Karpov blundered on his 33rd and 64th moves and lost, ending the match in a draw and allowing Kasparov to keep the title. 

The overall game score between them stayed virtually even until the late 1990s, when the score shifted decisively towards Kasparov. Currently, in their 235 formal games played, Karpov has 23 wins, 33 losses, and an incredible 179 draws. In their five world championship matches, Karpov has 19 wins, 21 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.

Although twelve years older than Kasparov, Karpov still has the stamina and endurance to be a match for Kasparov. In 2002, he defeated Kasparov in a rapid time control match 2.5-1.5. Karpov is on record saying that had he had the opportunity to fight Fischer for the crown like Kasparov had the opportunity to fight him, he (Karpov) could have been a much better player as a result. Though the struggle for the world championship made them enemies, Karpov and Kasparov maintain a tremendous level of respect for each other{{fact}}. The two of them and their titanic struggles make up a chess rivalry that even surpassed that of [[Capablanca]] and [[Alekhine]].

==FIDE Champion again==

It came as a surprise, then, that Karpov lost a Candidates Match against [[Nigel Short]] in 1992. But in 1993, Karpov reacquired the FIDE World Champion title when Kasparov and Short split from FIDE. Karpov crushed [[Jan Timman]]&amp;mdash;the loser of the Candidates final against Short. Once again he had become World Champion, and once again he did so controversially. He defended his title against [[Gata Kamsky]] (+6 -3 =9) in 1996. However, in 1998, FIDE largely scrapped the old system of Candidate Matches, instead having a large knock-out event in which a large number of players contested short matches against each other over just a few weeks. In the first of these events, champion Karpov was seeded straight into the final, defeating [[Viswanathan Anand]] (+4 -2 =2). But subsequently the champion had to qualify like other players. Karpov resigned his title in anger at the new rules in 1999, so the winner of the 1999 tournament ([[Alexander Khalifman]]) became FIDE World Champion.

However, the FIDE champions were not recognized as such by the general public. The fact that the FIDE champions were regularly crushed by Kasparov in tournaments testified to his dominance. The FIDE matches received little public attention, while Kasparov's matches with the PCA and subsequently Braingames were widely reported in the media. For more details about these series of champions, see the [[World Chess Championship]] article.

==Towards Retirement?==

In 1991 Karpov temporarily dropped to third in the FIDE ranking list, the first time since 1971. Though he quickly recovered, many said that Karpov had lost his edge, and that his playing level had declined. However, Karpov bounced back against the world's very strongest players (in the order of their finish, [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]], [[Alexei Shirov|Shirov]], [[Evgeny Bareev|Bareev]], [[Vladimir Kramnik|Kramnik]], [[Joel Lautier|Lautier]], [[Viswanathan Anand|Anand]], [[Gata Kamsky|Kamsky]], [[Veselin Topalov|Topalov]], [[Vassily Ivanchuk|Ivanchuk]], [[Boris Gelfand|Gelfand]], [[Miguel Illescas|Illescas]], [[Judit Polgar]], and [[Alexander Beliavsky|Beliavsky]]) in the landmark &quot;super-strong&quot; tournament [[Linares chess tournament|Linares]] 1994 (average [[ELO rating system|ELO rating]] 2685, the highest in history, meaning it was the first Category XVIII tournament ever held).

Impressed by the strength of the tournament, Kasparov had said several days before the tournament that the winner could rightfully be called the world champion of tournaments. Perhaps spurred on by this comment, Karpov played the chess of his life and dramatically won the tournament. He was undefeated and earned 11 points out of 13 possible (the best world-class tournament winning percentage in 64 years), dominating second-place Kasparov and Shirov by a huge 2.5 points. Many of his wins were spectacular (in particular, his win over Topalov, detailed below, is considered possibly his finest throughout his career).  This performance against the best players in the world put his [[ELO rating system|ELO rating]] tournament performance at 2985, the highest performance rating of any chess player in any tournament in all of chess history. 

Even recently, few players have surpassed Karpov's achievements. Since he dropped out of the top three players in the world on the FIDE rankings, only [[Garry Kasparov]], [[Viswanathan Anand]], [[Vladimir Kramnik]], and (as of January 2005) [[Veselin Topalov]] have been in the top three slots. In other words, Karpov is the last person to have been in the top three in the world before Kasparov, Anand, Kramnik, and Topalov. In addition, Karpov is the only player among these to ever have ranked number one in the world ahead of Kasparov.

However, Karpov's outstanding classical tournament play has been seriously limited since 1995, since he prefers to be more involved in politics of his home country of Russia. He had been a member of the [[Supreme Soviet]] Commission for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Soviet Peace Fund before the Soviet Union broke up. In addition, he had been involved in several disputes with FIDE and became increasingly disillusioned with chess. In the October 2005 FIDE rating list, he is 33rd in the world with an ELO rating of 2672.

However, more recently, because of his traditional strength at managing his thinking time, Karpov has instead begun revamping his style to specialize in rapid chess.

'''Motor racing''' or '''motorsport''' may also mean [[motorcycle racing]], and can include [[motorboat racing]] and [[air racing]]. It is one of the world's most popular [[spectator sport]]s and perhaps the most thoroughly [[commercialization|commercialized]].

== History ==
=== The Start===
Auto racing began almost immediately after the construction of the first successful [[gasoline|petrol]]-fuelled autos. In [[1894]], the first contest was organized by Paris magazine ''[[Le Petit Journal]]'', a reliability test  to determine best performance.

A year later the first real race was staged, from [[Paris]], [[France]] to [[Bordeaux]], France. First over the line was [[Émile Levassor]] but he was disqualified because his car was not a required four-seater. 

An international competition began with the [[Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing]].

The first auto race in the [[United States]], over a 54.36 mile (87.48 km) course, took place in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]] on [[November 2]], [[1895]], [[Frank Duryea]] winning in 10 h and 23 min, beating three petrol-fuelled cars and two electric. The first trophy awarded was the [[Vanderbilt Cup]].

=== City to city racing ===
[[Image:Mors.jpg||thumb|340px|Fernand Gabriel driving a Mors in Paris-Madrid 1903]]
With auto construction and racing dominated by [[France]], the French automobile club  ACF staged a number of major international races, usually from or to Paris, connecting with another major city in Europe or France.

These very successful races ended in [[1903]] when Marcel [[Renault]] was involved in a fatal accident near [[Angouleme]] in the Paris-Madrid race. Eight fatalities caused the French government to stop the race in [[Bordeaux]] and ban open-road racing.
&lt;!-- (much more on this) --&gt;

===1910-1950===
The [[1930s]] saw the radical differentiation of racing vehicles from high-priced road cars, with [[Delage]], [[Auto Union]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Delahaye]] and [[Bugatti]] constructing streamlined vehicles with engines producing up to 450 kW(612HP) with the aid of multiple superchargers. From [[1928]]-[[1930]] and again in [[1934]]-[[1936]], the maximum [[weight]] permitted was 750 kg(1654Lbs), a rule diametrically opposed to current racing regulations. Extensive use of aluminium alloys was required to achieve light weight, and in the case of the Mercedes, the paint was removed to satisfy the weight limitation, producing the famous [[Silver Arrows]].

== Categories ==
There are many categories of auto racing.

=== Single-seater racing ===
:''Main article: [[Open wheel racing]]''
[[Image:formula_one_car.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A modern Formula One car]]
Single-seater ([[open-wheel]]) racing is perhaps the most well-known form of motorsport, with cars designed specifically for high-speed racing. The wheels are not covered, and the cars often have aerofoil wings front and rear to produce downforce and enhance adhesion to the track.

Single-seater races are held on specially designed closed circuits or  street circuits closed for the event. Many single-seater races in North America are held on &quot;oval&quot; circuits and the [[Indy Racing League]] races mostly on ovals.

The best-known variety of single-seater racing is the [[Formula One]] World Championship, which involves an annual championship featuring major international car and engine manufacturers in an ongoing battle of technology and driver skill. Formula One is, by any measure, the most expensive sport in the world, with some teams spending in excess of 201 million US dollars per year. Formula One is widely considered to be the pinnacle of motorsports, and a seat in a Formula One car is undoubtedly the peak of any driver's racing career. In North America, the cars used in the [[American Championship Car Racing|National Championship]] (currently [[Champcars]] and the [[Indy Racing League]]) have traditionally been similar to [[F1 cars]] but with more restrictions on technology aimed at helping to control costs.

Other single-seater racing series are [[GP2 Series|GP2]] (formerly known as [[Formula 3000]] and [[Formula Two]]), [[Formula Nippon]], [[Formula Nissan]] (also known as the Telefonica World Series), [[Formula Three]], [[Formula Atlantic]], and [[A1 Grand Prix]].

There are other categories of single-seater racing, including [[kart racing]], which employs a small, low-cost machine on small tracks. Many of today's top drivers started their careers in karts.

=== Rallying ===
:''Main article: [[Rallying]]''
[[Rallying]], or rally racing,  involves highly modified production cars on (closed) public roads or off-road areas run on a point-to-point format where participants and their co-drivers “rally” to a set of points, leaving in regular intervals from start points. A rally is typically conducted over a number of stages of any terrain, which entrants are often allowed to scout beforehand. The co-driver uses the &quot;pacenotes&quot; to help the driver complete each stage as fast as possible, reading the detailed shorthand aloud over an in-car intercom system. Competition is based on lowest total elasped time over the course of an event.

The top series is the [[World Rally Championship]] (WRC), but there also regional championships and many countries have their own national championships. Some famous rallies include the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] and [[Rally Argentina]]. Another famous event (actually best described as a &quot;[[rally raid]]&quot;) is the [[Paris-Dakar Rally]]. There are also many smaller, club level, [[categories of rallies]] which are popular with amateurs, making up the &quot;grass roots&quot; of motorsports.

=== Ice Racing ===
:''Main article: [[Ice Racing]]''

=== Touring car racing===
:''Main article: [[Touring car racing]]''
[[Image:11_murphy_leads.jpg|left|170px|thumb|V8 Supercar Touring car racing]]
Touring car racing is a style of road racing that is run with production derived race cars. It often features exciting, full-contact racing due to the small speed differentials and large grids.

The [[V8 Supercars]] originally from [[Australia]], [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] originally from [[Germany]], and the [[World Touring Car Championship]] held with 2 non-European races (previously the [[European Touring Car Championship]]) are the major touring car championships conducted worldwide. 

The [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[SPEED World Challenge]] Touring Car and GT championships are dominant in North America while the venerable [[British Touring Car Championship]] continues in [[Great Britain]]. America's historic [[Trans-Am Series]] is undergoing a period of transition, but is still the longest-running road racing series in the U.S.  The [[National Auto Sport Association]] also provides a venue for amateurs to compete in home-built factory derived vehicles on various local circuits.

===Stock car racing===
[[Image:Riverside_Raceway.JPG|thumb|250px|right|One of the most famous NASCAR tracks was the old [[Riverside International Raceway]] in [[Riverside, California]].]]

:''Main article: [[Stock car racing]]''
[[Stock car racing]] is the American variant of touring car racing. Usually conducted on ovals, the cars look like production cars but are in fact purpose-built racing machines which are all very similar in specifications. Early stock cars were much closer to production vehicles; the car to be raced was often driven from track to track.

The main stock car racing series is [[NASCAR]]  and among the most famous races in the series are the [[Daytona 500]] and [[Allstate 400 at The Brickyard]]. NASCAR also runs the [[Busch Series]] (a junior stock car league) and the [[Craftsman Truck Series]] ([[pickup truck]]s). 

NASCAR also runs the [[Featherlite]] series of &quot;modified&quot; cars which are heavily modified from stock form.  With powerful engines, large tires, and light bodies. NASCAR's oldest series is considered by many to be its most exciting.

There are also other stock car series like [[IROC]] in the United States and [[CASCAR]] in [[Canada]].

[[British Stock car racing]] is a form of Short Oval Racing 
This takes place on Shale or Tarmac tracks in either Clockwise or Anti-Clockwise direction, Depending on the class some of which are contact.

Races are organised by local promoters and all drivers are registered with BRISCA and have their own race number.

What classes exist depends on the promoters, so events in [[Scotland]] at Cowdenbeath can be very different from an event at [[Wimbledon Stadium]] in [[London]].

''Formula Cars''
* F1 - Cars built to Specification normally utilising 5,6 or 7 Litre V8 engines
* F2 - Specification built cars similar to F1 with 2 Litre Ford Pinto Engines
These are the two main National forms of British Stock Car Racing, there are World Championships organised by the governing body [http://www.brisca.com/BRISCA]

There are also local variants raced in some smaller tracks, they are usually similar to F2 Stock Cars.

F1's race (in the UK) at the following venues:

Belle Vue Stadium (Manchester),
Owlerton Stadium (Sheffield),
Skegness Stadium,
Buxton,
Hednesford,
Birmingham,
Northampton,
Coventry,
Kings Lynn,
Ipswich,
Cowdenbeath,
Knockhill.

They also race in Holland.

''Hot Rods''
* Local Variations on the concept of fibreglass cars that look like production models Non Contact

''Production Models''
*Modified Road cars, classes range from Non-Contact 2 Litre Hot Rods to Contact Banger Racing.

Contact Classes can be identified by the inclusion of external side impact bars and large bumpers at either end made out of square section steel.

===Drag racing===
:''Main article: [[Drag racing]]''
In [[drag racing]], the objective is to complete a certain distance, traditionally 1/4 mile, (400 m), in the shortest possible time. The vehicles range from the everyday car to the purpose-built [[dragster]]. Speeds and elapsed time differ from class to class. A street car can cover the 1/4 mile (400 m) in 15 s whereas a [[top fuel dragster]] can cover the same distance in 4.5 s and reach 330 mph (530 km/h).  Drag racing was organised as a sport by [[Wally Parks]] in the early [[1950s]] through the [[NHRA]] (National Hot Rod Association) which is the largest sanctioning motor sports body in the world. The NHRA was formed to prevent people from [[street racing]]. Illegal street racing is not drag racing.

Launching its run to 330 mph (530 km/h), a top fuel dragster will accelerate at 4.5 ''[[Gee|g]]'' (44 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and when braking and parachutes are deployed, the driver experiences deceleration of 4 ''g'' (39 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), more than space shuttle occupants. A single top fuel car can be heard over eight miles (13 km) away and can generate a reading of 1.5 to 2 on the [[Richter scale]]. (NHRA Mile High Nationals 2001, and 2002 testing from the National Seismology Center.)

Drag racing is often head-to-head where two cars battle each other, the winner proceeding to the next round. Professional classes are all first to the finish line wins. Sportsman racing is handicapped (slower car getting a head start) using an index, and cars running faster than their index &quot;break out&quot; and lose.

Drag racing is mostly popular in the [[United States]].

===Sports car racing===
:''Main article: [[Sports car racing]]''
In [[sports car racing]], production versions of sports cars and purpose-built prototype cars compete with each other on closed circuits. The races are usually conducted over long distances, at least 1000 km, and cars are driven by teams of two or three drivers (and sometimes more in the US), switching every now and then. Due to the performance difference between production based sports cars and sports racing prototypes, one race usually involves many racing classes. In the US the [[American Le Mans]] Series was organized in 1999, featuring GT, GTS, and two prototype classes. Another series based on Le Mans began in 2004, the [[Le Mans Endurance Series]], which included four 1000 km races at tracks in Europe. A competing body, [[Grand-Am]], which began in 2000, sanctions its own set of endurance series, the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] and the [[Grand-Am Cup]]. Grand-Am events typically feature many more cars and much closer competition than American Le Mans.

Famous sports car races include the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].

===Offroad racing===
:''Main article: [[Offroad racing]]''
In [[offroad racing]], various classes of specially modified vehicles, including cars, compete in races through off-road environments. In North America these races often take place in the desert, such as the famous [[Baja 1000]].
In Europe, &quot;offroad&quot; refers to events such as autocross or rallycross, while desert races and rally-raids such as the [[Paris-Dakar Rally|Paris-Dakar]], [[Master Rallye]] or European &quot;bajas&quot; are called Cross-Country Rallies.

===Hillclimbing===
:''Main article: [[Hillclimbing]]''

===Kart racing===
:''Main article: [[Kart racing]]''
Although often seen as the entry point for serious racers into the sport, [[kart racing]], or karting, can be an economic way to try your luck at motorsport and is also a fully fledged international sport in its own right. World-famous F1-drivers like [[Michael Schumacher|Michael]] and [[Ralf Schumacher]] and most of the typical starting grid of a modern Grand Prix took up the sport at around the age of eight, with some testing from age three. Several former motorcycle champions have also taken up the sport, notably [[Wayne Rainey]], who was paralysed in a racing accident and now races a hand-controlled kart. As one of the cheapest ways to go racing, karting is seeing its popularity grow worldwide.

Go-karts, or just &quot;karts&quot; - seem very distant from normal road cars, with dimunitive frames and wheels, but a small engine combined with very light weight make for a quick machine. The tracks are also on a much smaller scale, making kart racing more accessible to the people.

==Use of flags==
''Main article: [[Racing flags]]''

In open-wheel, stock-car and other types of circuit auto races, flags are displayed to indicate the general status of a race and to communicate instructions to competitors in a race. While the flags have changed from the first years (e.g. red used to start a race), these are generally accepted for today.

{|
! Flag
! Displayed from start tower
! Displayed from observation post
|-
|[[Image:Auto Racing Green.svg|25px|Green flag]]
|The race has started or resumed after a full caution or stop, or the race is proceeding normally.
|End of hazardous section of track.
|-
|[[Image:Auto Racing Yellow.svg|25px|Yellow flag]]
|Full course caution condition for ovals. On road courses, it means a local area of caution. Depending on the type of racing, either two yellow flags will be used for a full course caution or a sign with 'SC' ([[Safety car]]) will be used as the field follows the [[pace car|pace/safety car]] on track and no cars may pass.
|Local caution condition — no cars may pass at the particular corner where being displayed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Libertatis Aequilibritas GFDL.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The ''Libertatis Æquilibritas'' is one [[Anarcho-capitalist_terminology_and_symbolism|symbol]] used by anarcho-capitalists {{fact}}]]
{{Libertarianism}}

'''Anarcho-capitalism''' (aka '''free market anarchism''') is a [[philosophy]] based on the idea of [[individual sovereignty]],  and a prohibition against initiatory [[coercion]] and [[fraud]].  It sees the only just basis for [[law]] as arising from [[private property]] norms and an unlimited right of [[contract]] between sovereign individuals.  From this basis, anarcho-capitalism rejects the [[state]] as an unjustified monopolist and systematic aggressor against sovereign individuals, and embraces [[anti-statist]] [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. Anarcho-capitalists would aim to protect [[individual liberty]] and [[property]] by replacing a government monopoly, which is involuntarily funded through [[taxation]], with private, competing businesses that use physical force only in defense of liberty and property against aggressors. Hence, they believe that all goods and services, including law, order, and security, should be supplied through the mechanism of a [[free market]].

The philosophy embraces [[anti-statism|stateless]] capitalism as one of its foundational principles. The first well-known version of anarcho-capitalism to identify itself thus was developed by economists of the [[Austrian School]] and [[libertarians]] [[Murray Rothbard]] and [[Walter Block]] in the mid-20th century, synthesizing elements from Austrian School [[economics]], [[classical liberalism]] and [[19th century|19th-century]] [[American individualist anarchism]]. While Rothbard bases his philosophy on [[natural law]], others, such as [[David Friedman]], take a pragmatic [[consequentialist]] approach by arguing that anarcho-capitalism should be implemented because such a system would have consequences superior to alternatives. 

Because of this embrace of capitalism, there is considerable tension between anarcho-capitalists and [[anarchist]]s who see the [[anti-capitalism|rejection of capitalism]] as being just as essential to anarchist philosophy as rejection of the state. Despite this tension, many anarcho-capitalists have identified their philosophy as evolving from the tradition of American individualist anarchists such as [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[Lysander Spooner]].

Anarcho-capitalism can be considered a radical development of [[classical liberalism]]. Its grounding in liberalism stems from [[Gustave de Molinari]].  Many proponents of anarcho-capitalism, including Rothbard, argue that Molinari was the first anarcho-capitalist. However, Rothbard admitted that &quot;Molinari did not use the terminology, and probably would have balked at the name&quot; anarcho-capitalist.  Nonetheless, Molinari did argue for a free market, privatization of security, and did not oppose profit. His thoughts were influential on Rothbard and his contemporaries.

{{main|non-aggression axiom}}
Anarcho-capitalism, as formulated by Rothbard and others, holds strongly to the central [[libertarian]] ''nonaggression axiom'':

:[...] The basic axiom of libertarian political theory holds that every man is a [[self-ownership|selfowner]], having absolute jurisdiction over his own body. In effect, this means that no one else may justly invade, or aggress against, another's person. It follows then that each person justly owns whatever previously unowned resources he appropriates or &quot;mixes his labor with.&quot; From these twin axioms — self-ownership and &quot;homesteading&quot; — stem the justification for the entire system of property rights titles in a free-market society. This system establishes the right of every man to his own person, the right of donation, of bequest (and, concomitantly, the right to receive the bequest or inheritance), and the right of contractual exchange of property titles.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1982) [http://www.mises.org/rothbard/lawproperty.pdf &quot;Law, Property Rights, and Air Pollution&quot;] Cato Journal 2, No. 1 (Spring 1982): pp. 55-99. Retrieved [[20 May]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the nonaggression axiom can be said to be a prohibition against the initiation of force, or the threat of force, against persons (i.e., direct violence, [[assault]], [[murder]]) or property (i.e., fraud, [[burglary]], theft, taxation).&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1973) [http://www.mises.org/rothbard/newliberty.asp ''For a new Liberty''] Collier Books, A Division of Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York: pp.24-25. Retrieved [[20 May]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; The initiation of force is usually referred to as [[aggression]] or [[coercion]]. The difference between anarcho-capitalists and other libertarians is largely one of the degree to which they take this axiom. [[Minarchist]] libertarians, such as most people involved in [[Libertarian Party|Libertarian political parties]], would retain the state in some smaller and less invasive form, retaining public [[police]], [[courts]] and [[military]].  In contrast, anarcho-capitalists reject any level of state intervention, defining the state as a coercive monopoly and, as the only entity in human society that derives its income from legal aggression, an entity that inherently violates the central axiom of libertarianism.&lt;ref name=Rothbard-1982.2&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1982) [http://www.mises.org/rothbard/ethics/ethics.asp ''The Ethics of Liberty''] Humanities Press ISBN 0814775063:p162 Retrieved [[20 May]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as Rothbard, accept the nonaggression axiom on an intrinsic moral or [[natural law]] basis. Others, such as Friedman, take a [[consequentialist]] or [[egoist]] approach; rather than maintaining that aggression is intrinsically immoral, they maintain that a law against aggression can only come about by contract between self-interested parties who agree to refrain from initiating coercion against each other. It is in terms of the non-aggression principle that Rothbard defined [[anarchism]]; he defined &quot;anarchism as a system which provides no legal sanction for such aggression ['against person and property']&quot; and said that &quot;what anarchism proposes to do, then, is to abolish the State, i.e. to abolish the regularized institution of aggressive coercion.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1975) [http://www.mises.org/journals/lf/1975/1975_01.pdf ''Society Without A State (pdf)''] ''Libertarian Forum'' newsletter (January 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''New Banner'', Rothbard said that &quot;capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism, and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard103.html ''Exclusive Interview With Murray Rothbard''] The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal ([[25 February]] [[1972]])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original appropriation===
Central to anarcho-capitalism are the concepts of [[self-ownership]] and [[original appropriation]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone is the proper owner of his own physical body as well as of all places and nature-given goods that he occupies and puts to use by means of his body, provided only that no one else has already occupied or used the same places and goods before him. This ownership of &quot;originally appropriated&quot; places and goods by a person implies his right to use and transform these places and goods in any way he sees fit, provided only that he does not change thereby uninvitedly the physical integrity of places and goods originally appropriated by another person. In particular, once a place or good has been first appropriated by, in [[John Locke]]'s phrase, 'mixing one's labor' with it, ownership in such places and goods can be acquired only by means of a voluntary — contractual — transfer of its property title from a previous to a later owner.&lt;ref name=Hoppe-2002&gt;Hoppe, Hans-Hermann (2002) [http://www.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe7.html &quot;Rothbardian Ethics&quot;] Retrieved [[23 May]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is the root of anarcho-capitalist [[property rights]], and where they differ from [[collectivism|collectivist]] forms of anarchism. Original appropriation allows an individual to claim any &quot;unused&quot; property, including land, and by improving or otherwise using it, own it with the same absolute right as his own body.  According to Rothbard, original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around it; it is only by ''using'' land — by mixing one's labor with it — that original appropriation is legitimized: &quot;Any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rothbard-1962&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1962) [http://www.mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap2d.asp ''Man, Economy &amp; State with Power and Market''] Ludwig von Mises Institute ISBN 0945466307 ch2 Retrieved [[19 May]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a practical matter, in terms of the ownership of land, anarcho-capitalists recognize that there are few (if any) parcels of land left on Earth whose ownership was not at some point in time transferred as the result of coercion, usually through seizure by some form of state.  However, unless records and titles exist to confirm the theft and the rightful individual owner most do not believe that this history de-legitimizes current ownerships which are based on consensual transactions. They believe it is wrong to attempt to remedy past coercion by the use of present coercion (i.e., seizure or eviction). 

By accepting an axiomatic definition of private property and property rights, anarcho-capitalists deny the legitimacy of a state on principle:

:&quot;For, apart from ruling out as unjustified all activities such as murder, homicide, [[rape]], trespass, robbery, burglary, theft, and fraud, the [[ethics]] of private property is also incompatible with the existence of a state defined as an agency that possesses a compulsory territorial monopoly of ultimate decision-making (jurisdiction) and/or the right to tax.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hoppe-2002/&gt;

===The contractual society===
The society envisioned by anarcho-capitalists has been called the ''Contractual Society''; &quot;[...] a society based purely on voluntary action, entirely un­hampered by violence or threats of violence.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rothbard-1962/&gt; Because this system relies on voluntary agreements ([[contract]]s) between individuals as the only legal framework, it is difficult to predict precisely what the particulars of this society would look like. Those particulars are disputed both among anarcho-capitalists and between them and their critics.

One particular ramification is that transfer of property and services must be voluntary on the part of ''both'' parties.  No external entities can force an individual to accept or deny a particular transaction. An employer might offer [[insurance]] and [[death benefits]] to [[same-sex marriage|same-sex couples]]; another might refuse to recognize any union outside his or her own faith. Individuals would be free to enter into contractual agreements as they saw fit, allowing discrimination or favoritism based on language, [[race]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], or any other categorization. Anarcho-capitalists maintain that the social structure would be self-regulating, since any disenfranchised group can avail themselves of [[boycott]] or [[protest]], and other entrepreneurs will see their own interests (i.e., profit) in servicing the group.

Another important ramification is the fact that any social structure is permissible under anarcho-capitalism as long as it is formed by a contract between individuals. Therefore, radically different &quot;governments&quot; and subeconomies can form, creating a [[panarchism|panarchic]] society. Individuals could live in a privately owned [[democracy]], a [[republic]], or even a [[monarchy]] if they so choose.

One social structure that is not permissible under anarcho-capitalism is one that attempts to claim greater [[sovereignty]] than the individuals that form it. The state is a prime example, but another is the modern [[corporation]] — defined as a legal entity that exists under a different legal code than individuals as a means to shelter the individuals who own and run the corporation from possible legal consequences of acts by the corporation. It is worth noting that Rothbard allows a narrower definition of a corporation: &quot;Corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation [...].&quot;&lt;ref name=Rothbard-1962/&gt; However, this is a very narrow definition that only shelters owners from debt by creditors that specifically agree to the arrangement; it also does not shelter other [[liability]], such as from malfeasance or other wrongdoing.

There are limits to the right to contract under some interpretations of anarcho-capitalism. Rothbard himself asserts that the right to contract is based in [[inalienable rights|inalienable human rights]],&lt;ref name=Rothbard-1982.2/&gt; and therefore any contract that implicitly violates those rights can be voided at will, which would, for instance, prevent a person from permanently selling himself into [[slavery]]. Other interpretations conclude that banning such contracts would in itself be an unacceptably invasive interference in the right to contract.&lt;ref name=Nozick-1973&gt;[[Robert Nozick|Nozick, Robert]] (1973) ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private law and order===
Anarcho-capitalists only believe in collective defense of individual liberty (i.e., courts, military or police forces) insofar as such groups are formed and paid for on an explicitly voluntary basis. According to Molinari, &quot;Under a regime of liberty, the natural organization of the security industry would not be different from that of other industries.&quot;&lt;ref name=Molinari-1849&gt;Molinari, Gustave de (1849) [http://www.gustavedemolinari.org/GM-PS.htm The Production of Security] ''(trans. J. Huston McCulloch)'' Retrieved [[19 May]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents point out that private systems of justice and defense ''already'' exist, naturally forming where the market is allowed to compensate for the failure of the state: private arbitration, security guards, neighborhood watch groups, and so on.&lt;ref name=Friedman-1973&gt;[[David Friedman|Friedman, David D.]] (1973) ''[[The Machinery of Freedom|The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism]]'' Harper &amp; Row ISBN 0060910100 [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter_29.html ch29]&lt;/ref&gt; These private courts and police are sometimes referred to generically as Private Defense Agencies ([[PDA]]s.)

The defense of those unable to pay for such protection might be financed by charitable organizations relying on voluntary donation rather than by state institutions relying on coercive taxation, or by cooperative self-help by groups of individuals.

[[Retributive justice]], meaning retaliatory force, is often a component of the contracts imagined for an anarcho-capitalist society. Some believe [[prison]]s or [[indentured servitude]] would be justifiable institutions to deal with those who violate anarcho-capitalist property relations, while others believe [[exile]] or forced [[restitution]] are sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;O'Keeffe, Matthew (1989) [http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/legan/legan005.pdf &quot;Retribution versus Restitution&quot;] Legal Notes No.5, Libertarian Alliance ISBN 1870614224 Retrieved [[19 May]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The use of force===
[[Image:Bunkertrumbull.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Many anarcho-capitalists admire the American Revolution and believe it is the only U.S. war that can be justified.]]
The axiom of nonaggression is not necessarily a [[pacifism|pacifist]] doctrine; it is a prohibition against the '''initiation''' of (interpersonal) force.  Like classical liberalism, anarcho-capitalism permits the use of force, as long as it is in the defense of persons or property.

However, the permissible extent of this defensive use of force is an arguable point among anarcho-capitalists. Some argue that the initiator of any aggressive act should be subject to a retributive counterattack beyond what is solely necessary to repel the aggression. The counterargument is that such a counterattack is only legitimate insofar as it was defined in an agreement between the parties.

Another controversial application of &quot;defensive&quot; aggression is the act of revolutionary violence against tyrannical regimes. Many anarcho-capitalists admire [[the American Revolution]] as the legitimate act of individuals working together to fight against [[tyranny|tyrannical]] restrictions of their liberties.  In fact, according to Murray Rothbard, the American Revolutionary War was the only war involving the United States that could be justified.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1973) [http://www.antiwar.com/orig/rothbard_on_war.html Interview] ''Reason'' Feb 1973, Retrieved [[10 August]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; But, illustrating their general ambivalence toward war, these same people also sharply criticize the revolutionaries for the means used — taxes, [[conscription]], [[inflation|inflationary money]] — and the inadequacy of the result: a state.

While some anarcho-capitalists believe forceful resistance and revolutionary violence against the state is legitimate, most believe the use of force is a dangerous tool at best, and that violent [[insurrection]] should be a last resort.

==Conflicts within anarcho-capitalist theory==
There is dispute on whether anarcho-capitalism is properly justifiable on [[deontological]] or [[consequentialist]] grounds. Natural-law anarcho-capitalism (such as that advocated by Rothbard) holds that rights can be determined through natural law and that consequences are not relevant to their determination. Consequentialists such as Friedman disagree, maintaining that rights are merely human constructs that rational humans create through contract as a result of concluding what sort of system leads to the best consequences. Many anarcho-capitalists also hold a subjective theory of rights, maintaining that the lack of a [[positive right]] to aggress is sufficient to hold up the derivative claims of the nonaggression principle.

Friedman describes an economic approach to anarcho-capitalism. His description differs with Rothbard's because it does not use moral arguments — i.e., it does not appeal to a theory of [[natural rights]] to justify itself. In Friedman's work, the economic argument is sufficient to derive the principles of anarcho-capitalism. Private defense or protection agencies and courts not only defend legal rights but supply the actual content of these rights and all claims on the free market. People will have the law system they pay for, and because of [[economic efficiency]] considerations resulting from individuals' utility functions, such law will tend to be libertarian in nature but will differ from place to place and from agency to agency depending on the tastes of the people who buy the law. Also unlike other anarcho-capitalists, most notably Rothbard, Friedman has never tried to deny the theoretical cogency of the neoclassical literature on &quot;market failure,&quot; nor has he been inclined to attack economic efficiency as a normative benchmark.&lt;ref name=Friedman-1973/&gt;

==Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism==
{{main|Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism}}

===Dispute over the name &quot;anarchism&quot;===
Many anarchists strongly argue that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism, since they believe capitalism to be inherently authoritarian. [[Joe Peacott]] has explicitly stated that individualist anarchism is anti-capitalist, and contrasts it to anarcho-capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Peacott|Peacott, Joe]] (2003), [http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/econn/econn097.htm] Libertarian Alliance ISBN 1856375641&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchist Daniel Burton says that anarcho-capitalism is a &quot;type of individualist anarchism&quot;, but that most individualists are class-war anti-capitalists&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/ac-vs-ia.html ''Individualist anarchists vs. Anarcho-capitalism'']&lt;/ref&gt;. However, many individualists do not see their philosophy as a &quot;class war&quot; but a war against government repression of ''individual'' liberty.{{fact}} Murray Rothbard argues that an &quot;anarchist society [is] one where there is no legal possibility for coercive aggression against the person or property of any individual.&quot;  Whether anarcho-capitalism is a true form of anarchism may depend on the meaning of the words &quot;anarchism&quot; and &quot;capitalism&quot;.

Adherents of the traditional schools of anarchism reject the term &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot;. They oppose both the [[anti-statist|state]] and [[anti-capitalist|capitalism]] as coercive institutions, since &quot;αναρχία&quot; in Greek means &quot;without rulers&quot;. Conversely, many, including capitalist [[libertarians]] and anarcho-capitalists, use the term &quot;anarchism&quot; with a definition that simply means &quot;without the State&quot;.

Also, there is some terminological disagreement regarding &quot;capitalism&quot;. &lt;!-- *** SOURCE GIVEN IS IRRELEVANT, DOES NOT MATCH CLAIM *** According to individualist anarchist Larry Gambone, when the traditional anarchists use the term &quot;capitalism&quot;, they are referring to those who have &quot;gained wealth from the use of governmental power or from privileges granted by government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gambone, Larry (1998) [http://www.spunk.org/texts/pubs/tl/sp001872.html &quot;What is Anarchism?&quot;] ''Total Liberty'' Volume 1 Number 3 Autumn 1998, Retrieved [[10 August]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; According to Wendy McElroy, when traditional individualist anarchists referred to &quot;capitalism&quot; they &quot;meant ''state capitalism'', the alliance of government and business.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy (1999) [http://www.mises.org/fullstory.aspx?control=348&amp;id=74 Anarchism: Two Kinds]&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern individualist anarchists like Gambone believe that capitalism, as they define it, requires the presence of the state in order to function.  Therefore, for the individualist anarchist, the concept of rejecting &quot;state capitalism&quot; would be equivalent to rejection of all capitalism.

Hence, anarcho-capitalists depart from individualist anarchists on what constitutes concepts such as the &quot;state&quot;, &quot;capitalism&quot;, and a &quot;free market&quot;.  Jamal Hannah says that most anarchists and capitalists agree with the individualists in believing that capitalist economics require a state to defend private wealth.&lt;ref&gt;''Anarchy list&quot;, Hannah, Jamal (Dec 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite disagreeing on whether or not anti-state capitalism is a coherent concept, most anarchists oppose a state and support private defence of wealth.

Morever, the common definition of capitalism has changed over time. Anarchist movements of early origin operated with a definition unlike contemporary definitions. For example, the 1909 [[Century Dictionary]] defined capitalism as &quot;1. The state of having capital or property; possession of capital. 2. The concentration or massing of capital in the hands of a few; also, the power or influence of large or combined capital.&quot; In contrast, the contemporary [[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary (unabridged) refers to capitalism as &quot;an economic system characterized by private or corporation ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision rather than by state control, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly in a free market.&quot;

According to [http://www.anarchy.no/ai.html The Anarchist International], capitalism is an economic [[plutocracy]] that includes its own [[hierarchy]]. They place anarcho-capitalism outside of the anarchist movement, and into the classical liberal tradition &quot;[[Plutarchy]] without statism = liberalism.&quot;  Some, while accepting that anarcho-capitalism is a radical form of liberalism, question the coherence of such a statement, holding that if [[socialism]] and [[communism]] can have anarchist forms, then liberalism can as well.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, Richard A. (2002) [http://www.againstpolitics.com/market_anarchism/no_bogus_anarchy.htm On Peter Sabatini's &quot;Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy&quot;] ''Ifeminists Newsletter'' [[May 14]] [[2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; Often, anarchist individualism is regarded as a form of socialism (for example, by individualist anarchists such as E. Armand&lt;ref&gt;Armand, E. (1907), Anarchist Individualism as Life and Activity&lt;/ref&gt;). However, American individualist anarchism is sometimes regarded as a form of &quot;liberal-anarchism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Weisbord, Albert (1937) [http://www.weisbord.org/conquest10.htm ''American Liberal-Anarchism''] from ''The Conquest of Power'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bkmarcus.com/blog/2004/11/liberal-anarchism.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://homepage.mac.com/dmhart/ComteDunoyer/Ch1fn.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as anarchists by definition favor voluntary interaction, anarcho-capitalists and their opponents disagree on whether certain actions are voluntary (see sidebar for definitions).

Some anarchists espouse a form of [[labor theory of value]], which they put forth as one reason that [[profit]], [[Economic rent|rent]], and [[wage labour]] are [[exploitation|exploitive]]. While classical capitalists such as [[Adam Smith]] also accepted the labor theory of value, most modern economists, including anarcho-capitalists, argue that value is subjective and adhere to [[marginalism]].

===&quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right&quot; anarchism===
The divide between anarcho-capitalism and traditional anarchism has been termed as [[left anarchism]] versus [[right anarchism]] by some individuals, such as [[Ulrike Heider]], who placed anarcho-capitalism on the far right.&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Ulrike (1994) [http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/books/other/anarchism.html ''Anarchism: Left, Right, and Green''] City Lights Books ISBN 0872862895 Retrieved [[19 May]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most contemporary anarcho-capitalists reject the standard [[Left-Right politics|linear model of ideologies]] in favor of a multidimensional model with a liberty-authority dimension, though some of their opponents maintain that anarchism itself is a left-wing ideology.

==History and influences==
[[Image:molinari.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gustave de Molinari]] (1819–1912)]]

===Liberalism===
{{main|Liberalism}}

Anarcho-capitalist philosophy has been influenced by many sources.  The primary influence with the longest history is classical liberalism.  Classical liberals have had two main themes since [[John Locke]] first expounded the philosophy: the liberty of man, and limitations of state power.  The liberty of man was expressed in terms of [[natural rights]], while limiting the [[state]] was based (for Locke) on a [[consent theory]].  While Locke saw the state as evolving from society via a [[social contract]], later, more radical liberals saw a fundamental schism between society, the &quot;natural&quot; voluntary interactions of men, and state, the institution of brute force.

In the 18th century, liberal revolutionaries in Britain and America had opposed [[statism]] without grounding it in theory, while some French economists had theorized it without endorsing it. In the 19th century, classical liberals led the attack against statism. One notable was [[Frederic Bastiat]] (''The Law''),  who wrote, &quot;The state is the great fiction by which everybody seeks to live at the expense of everybody else.&quot; [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s liberalism might be considered evolutionary anarchism, as he wrote, &quot;I heartily accept the motto, 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, 'That government is best which governs not at all'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David (1849) [http://www.cs.indiana.edu/statecraft/civ.dis.html Civil Disobedience]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of privatizing protection of individual liberty and property was France's [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in the 18th century. Later, in the 1840s, [[Julius Faucher]] and [[Gustave de Molinari]] advocated the same. Molinari, in his essay ''The Production of Security'', argued, &quot;No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity.&quot;  Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian [[Ralph Raico]] asserts what that these liberal philosophers &quot;had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Raico, Ralph (2004) [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, Unité associée au CNRS&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people — society — and the institutions of force — the State.  This ''society versus state'' idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority, and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few.&lt;ref name=Molinari-1849/&gt; The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued after Molinari in the early writings of [[Herbert Spencer]], as well as in thinkers such as [[Paul Émile de Puydt]] and [[Auberon Herbert]].

Later, in the early 20th century, the mantle of anti-state liberalism was taken by the &quot;[[Old Right]]&quot;.  These were minarchist, antiwar, anti-imperialist, and (later) anti-[[New Deal]]ers.  Some of the most notable members of the Old Right were [[Albert Jay Nock]], [[Rose Wilder Lane]], [[Isabel Paterson]], [[Frank Chodorov]], [[Garet Garrett]], and [[H. L. Mencken]].  In the 1950s, the new &quot;fusion conservatism&quot;, also called &quot;[[cold war]] conservatism&quot;, took hold of the right wing in the U.S., stressing anti-communism.  This induced the libertarian Old Right to split off from the right, and seek alliances with the (now left-wing) antiwar movement, and to start specifically libertarian organizations such as the (U.S.) Libertarian Party.

===American individualist anarchism===
[[Image:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lysander Spooner]] (1808–87)]]
:''Main articles: [[American individualist anarchism]], [[American individualist anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''{{Anarchism}}

Anarcho-capitalism is influenced by the work of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists. Rothbard sought to meld the 19th-century individualist theory with the principles of Austrian economics: &quot;There is, in the body of thought known as 'Austrian economics', a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung&quot; (''Egalitarianism''). The 19th-century individualist anarchists espoused a labor theory of value, while the anarcho-capitalists adhere to a subjective theory, leading to differences over the legitimacy of [[profit]].  Anarchist historian Peter Marshall believes that anarcho-capitalists selectively interpret individualist anarchists texts, overlooking egalitarian implications. &lt;ref&gt;http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/dward/newrightanarchocap.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marshall may have overlooked that the most noted individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker explicitly supports the right to inequality in wealth and upholds it as the natural result of liberty&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker29.html ''Economic Rent'']&lt;/ref&gt;.  Tucker did, although, oppose vast concentrations of wealth which he believed were made possible by government intervention which protected monopoly. He believed the most dangerous intervention was the protection of a &quot;banking monopoly&quot; which concentrated capital in the hands of the privileged elite. Though, he also argued that harmful monopolies that were created by government intervention could be maintained in the absence of government protection because of the accumulation of great wealth (see [[predatory pricing]]). Anarcho-capitalists also oppose governmental restrictions on banking. They, like all Austrian economists, believe that monopoly can only come about through government intervention. Most modern individualists, following in the footsteps of historical counterparts, reject capitalism in the sense of government-backed privilege for capital.  Individualists anarchists have long argued that monopoly on credit and land interferes with the functioning of a free market economy. Although anarcho-capitalists disagree on the critical topic of [[profit]], both schools of thought agree on other issues. Of particular importance to anarcho-capitalists and the individualists are the ideas of private property, &quot;sovereignty of the individual&quot;, a market economy, and the opposition to [[collectivism]]. In addition, like the individualists, anarcho-capitalists believe that land may be originally appropriated by, and only by, occupation or use; however, most traditional individualists believe it must ''continually'' be in use to retain title.  Notable 19th-century American individualist anarchists include [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Benjamin Tucker]].

Lysander Spooner's articles, such as [http://www.lysanderspooner.org/notreason.htm ''No Treason''] and the [http://www.lysanderspooner.org/LetterToBayard.htm ''Letter to Thomas Bayard''], were widely reprinted in early anarcho-capitalist journals, and his ideas — especially his individualist critique of the state and his defense of the right to ignore or withdraw from it — were often cited by anarcho-capitalists. Spooner was staunchly opposed to government interference in economic matters, and supported a &quot;right to acquire property [...] as one of the natural, inherent, inalienable rights of men [...] one which government has no power to infringe [...]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander (1843) [http://www.lysanderspooner.org/constitutionallaw.htm ''Constitutional law, Relative to Credit, Currency, and Banking''] Retrieved [[19 May]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Like all anarchists, he opposed government regulation: &quot;All legislative restraints upon the rate of interest are arbitrary and tyrannical restraints upon a man's natural capacity amid natural right to hire capital, upon which to bestow his labor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander (1846) [http://www.lysanderspooner.org/Poverty.htm ''Poverty: Its Illegal Causes and Cure''] Retrieved [[19 May]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly vocal, however, in opposing any collusion between banks and government, and argued that the monopolistic privileges that the government granted to a few bankers were the source of many social and economic ills.

Benjamin Tucker supported private ownership of the product of labor, which he believed entailed a rejection of both collective and capitalist ownership.  He was a staunch advocate of the [[mutualist]] form of recompensing labor, which holds to &quot;[[Cost the limit of price]]&quot;.  He also advocated a free [[market economy]], which he believed was prohibited by capitalist monopoly of credit and land backed by the state.  He believed that anyone who wishes should be allowed to engage in the banking business and issue their private currency without needing special permission from government, and that unused land should not be restricted to those who wished to use it.  He believed that if these and other coercive actions were eliminated that profit in economic transactions would be rendered nearly impossible because of increased availability of capital to all individuals and resulting increased competition in business. Accepting the [[labor theory of value]] and the resulting &quot;cost principle&quot; as a premise marks one of mutualism's main conflicts with anarcho-capitalism. Although his self-identification as a socialist and sympathy for the [[labor movement]] led to hostility from some early anarcho-capitalists such as [[Robert LeFevre]], others, such as Murray Rothbard, embraced his critique of the state and claimed that he defined his &quot;socialism&quot; not in terms of opposition to a free market or private property, but in opposition to government privileges for business.  However, individualists argue that capitalism cannot be maintained in the absence of the state.  For example, Kevin Carson argues, &quot;As a mutualist anarchist, I believe that expropriation of surplus value — i.e., capitalism — cannot occur without state coercion to maintain the privilege of usurer, landlord, and capitalist. It was for this reason that the free market mutualist Benjamin Tucker — from whom right-libertarians selectively borrow — regarded himself as a libertarian socialist.&quot;  Tucker characterized the economic demands of Proudhon and Warren by saying, &quot;though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, they aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few [...] Absolute Free Trade; free trade at home, as well as with foreign countries; the logical carrying out of the Manchester doctrine; ''laissez-faire'' the universal rule.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker|Tucker, Benjamin]] (1888) [http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm ''State Socialism and Anarchism: How Far They Agree, and Wherein They Differ''] Liberty 5.16, no. 120 ([[10 March]] [[1888]]), pp. 2-3.Retrieved [[20 May]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-capitalism is sometimes viewed by those sympathetic to it as a form of individualist anarchism, despite the fact that the original individualist anarchists universally rejected capitalism (i.e., they opposed profit, which is seen as a fundamental characteristic of capitalism).  Organizations such as mutualist.org remain dedicated to &quot;free market anticapitalism,&quot; while individualists like [[Larry Gambone]] explicitly state that all capitalism is state capitalism.  Nonetheless, anarcho-capitalist Wendy McElroy considers herself to be an individualist, while admitting that the original individualists were universally anticapitalist.  In addition, historian Guglielmo Piombini refers anarcho-capitalism as a form of individualist anarchism, though he offers no support for this statement.  Collectivist anarchist author Iain McKay and historian Peter Sabatini both argue that anarcho-capitalism is fundamentally opposed to individualist anarchism.

The similarity to anarcho-capitalism in regard to private defense of liberty and property is probably best seen in a quote by 19th-century individualist anarchist [[Victor Yarros]]: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Anarchism means no government, but it does not mean no laws and no coercion. This may seem paradoxical, but the paradox vanishes when the Anarchist definition of government is kept in view. Anarchists oppose government, not because they disbelieve in punishment of crime and resistance to aggression, but because they disbelieve in compulsory protection. Protection and taxation without consent is itself invasion; hence Anarchism favors a system of voluntary taxation and protection.&lt;ref&gt;Yarros, Victor ''Our Revolution; Essays and Interpretations'' p.80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Austrian School ===
{{main|Austrian School}}
[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|right| [[Murray Rothbard]] (1926–95)]]
The Austrian School of economics was founded with the publication of [[Carl Menger]]'s 1871 book ''[[Principles of Economics]]''.  Members of this school approach economics as an ''a priori'' system like logic or mathematics, rather than as an empirical science like geology.  It attempts to discover axioms of human action (called &quot;[[praxeology]]&quot; in the Austrian tradition) and make deductions therefrom.  Some of these praxeological axioms are:

:*Humans act purposefully.
:*Humans prefer more of a good to less.
:*Humans prefer to receive a good sooner rather than later.
:*Each party to a trade benefits ''[[ex ante]]''.

These are macro-level generalizations, or [[heuristics]], which are true for the many, but not necessarily true for any particular person.

Even in the early days, Austrian economics was used as a theoretical weapon against socialism and statist socialist policy.  [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], a colleague of Menger, wrote one of the first critiques of socialism ever written in his treatise ''The Exploitation Theory of Socialism-Communism''.  Later, [[Friedrich Hayek]] wrote ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', asserting that a [[command economy]] destroys the information function of prices, and that authority over the economy leads to [[totalitarianism]].  Another very influential Austrian economist was [[Ludwig von Mises]], author of the praxeological work ''Human Action''.

Murray Rothbard, a student of Mises, is the man who attempted to meld Austrian economics with classical liberalism and individualist anarchism, and is credited with coining the term &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot;.  He was probably the first to use &quot;libertarian&quot; in its current (U.S.) pro-capitalist sense.  He was a trained economist, but also knowledgeable in history and political philosophy.  When young, he considered himself part of the [[Old Right]], an anti-statist and anti-[[interventionist]] branch of the [[Republican Party (United States)|U.S. Republican]] party.  When interventionist [[cold warrior]]s of the ''[[National Review]]'', such as [[William Buckley]], gained influence in the Republican party in the 1950s, Rothbard quit that group and formed an alliance with [[left-wing]] [[antiwar]] groups.  Later, Rothbard was a founder of the U.S. Libertarian Party.  In the late 1950s, Rothbard was briefly involved with [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[objectivist philosophy|objectivism]] group, but later had a falling out.  Rothbard's books, such as ''[[Man, Economy, and State]]'', ''[[Power and Market]]'', ''The Ethics of Liberty'', and ''For a New Liberty'', are considered by some to be classics of natural law libertarian thought.

===Objectivism===
Though [[Ayn Rand]] was opposed to anarcho-capitalism, some anarcho-capitalist and libertarian followers, including Rothbard, see Ayn Rand as one of their most vocal and visible champions. Through her philosophy of [[objectivist philosophy|objectivism]], Rand firmly grounded laissez-faire capitalism on her ethical system of Reason, Self-interest, and Individualism. She, however, explicitly rejected the idea of competing private defense institutions. Some anarcho-capitalists derive much of their philosophical inspirations from Rand's arguments. Rand was adamant that the government did play a necessary and important role in society, that of policing the society, protecting individual rights, and stepping into an aggressor role only in retaliation, self-defense or defense of the country.

==Anarcho-capitalism in the real world==
[[Image:Law speaker.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[19th-century]] interpretation of the [[Althing]] in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], which authors such as [[David Friedman]] and [[Roderick Long]] believe to have been a functioning anarcho-capitalist society.]] 
Anarcho-capitalism is largely theoretical, and even sympathetic critics say that it is unlikely ever to be more than a [[utopian]] ideal.  Despite this, some anarcho-capitalist philosophers point to actual societies to support their claim that stateless capitalism can function in practice.

===Medieval Iceland===
According to [[David Friedman]], &quot;[[Icelandic Commonwealth |Medieval Icelandic institutions]] have several peculiar and interesting characteristics; they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental functions.&quot;&lt;ref name=Friedman-79&gt;Friedman, David D. (1979) [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html Private Creation and Enforcement of Law: A Historical Case], Retrieved [[12 August]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the Icelandic Commonwealth between 930 and 1262 had some of the features of an anarcho-capitalist society--while there was a single legal system, enforcement of law was entirely private--and so provides some evidence of how such a society would function.  &quot;Even where the Icelandic legal system recognized an essentially &quot;public&quot; offense, it dealt with it by giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system.&quot;&lt;ref name=Friedman-79/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/english/vikingstudies/jackson/researchdocument.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some disagree with this assessment, arguing that Medieval Iceland was a communal rather than individualist society - ''[p]eople of a communitarian nature... have reason to be attracted [to Medieval Iceland]... The economy barely knew the existence of markets. Social relations preceded economic relations. '' &lt;ref&gt;William Ian Miller, &quot;Bloodtaking and Peacemaking: Feud, Law and Society in Saga Iceland&quot;, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; and that when a free market finally did arise, that it was the cause of the end of the republic - ''&quot;During the 12th century, wealth and power began to accumulate in the hands of a few chiefs, and by 1220, six prominent families ruled the entire country. It was the internecine power struggle among these families, shrewdly exploited by King Haakon IV of Norway, that finally brought the old republic to an end.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Hallberg Hallmundsson, an article on Iceland in the &quot;Encyclopaedia Americana&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Somalia===
[[Image:Somalia_marketplace_2_DoD.JPG|300px|left|thumb|A marketplace in [[Somalia]], 1992, one year after the collapse of the government.  Somalia is cited by some anarcho-capitalists as an example how stateless capitalism is possible.]]
More recently, [[Somalia]] is cited by some as a real-world example of how a stateless capitalist economy and a legal system can develop organically. Since 1991, Somalia as a whole has had no functioning central government, and therefore no regulations or licensing requirements for businesses, and no taxes on businesses or individuals. One World Bank study reports that &quot;it may be easier than is commonly thought for basic systems of finance and some infrastructure services to function where government is extremely weak or absent.&quot;&lt;ref name=WorldBank-2004&gt;Nenova, Tatiana and Harford, Tim (2004) [http://rru.worldbank.org/Documents/PapersLinks/280-nenova-harford.pdf Anarchy and Invention (PDF)] Public Policy Journal Note Number 280, Retrieved [[12 August]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Kevin Sites, after a recent trip to Somalia, reported: &quot;Somalia, though brutally poor, is a kind of libertarian's dream. Free enterprise flourishes, and vigorous commercial competition is the only form of regulation. Somalia has some of the best telecommunications in Africa, with a handful of companies ready to wire home or office and provide crystal-clear service, including international long distance, for about $10 a month.&quot;  One of the poorest countries in the world in 1991, Somalia remains a very poor country.  However, wealth distribution appears to be more uniform than in other African countries.  When extreme poverty was last measured in 1998 (percentage of individuals living on less than PPP$1 a day), it was faring better than wealthier West African and neighboring countries.&lt;ref name=WorldBank-2004/&gt;

In the absence of a state and business regulations the private sector has flourished. One business sector that is said to be doing well is telecommunications.  Abdullahi Mohammed Hussein of Telecom Somalia says &quot;The government post and telecoms company used to have a monopoly but after the regime was toppled, we were free to set up our own business&quot; ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4020259.stm according to a BBC report]). Also, in 1989, before the collapse of the government, the national airline had only one airplane. Now there are approximately 15 airlines, over 60 aircraft, 6 international destinations, and more domestic routes. Electricity is now furnished by entrepreneurs, who have purchased generators and divided cities into manageable sectors (''[http://www.somalianarchy.com/viewtopic.php?t=16 photo]''). With the collapse of the central government, the educations system is now private and includes universities such as [[Mogadishu University]]. A World Bank study reports &quot;modest gains in education.&quot; As last measured in 2001, primary school enrollment, which stood at 17%, was nearly at prewar levels, and secondary school enrollment had been increasing since 1998. However, &quot;adult literacy is estimated to have declined from the already low level of 24% in 1989 to 17.1% in 2001&quot; ([http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/03/25/000112742_20040325090551/Rendered/PDF/282760Somalia0Country0reengagement0note.pdf ''WB study'']). A more recent 2003 study reported that the literacy rate had risen to 19% ([http://rru.worldbank.org/Documents/PapersLinks/280-nenova-harford.pdf ''WB study'']).  A statistic from 2000 indicated that only 21% of the population had access to safe drinking water at that time. The impact of collapse of the government and ensuing civil war on human development in Somalia has been profound, resulting in the collapse of political institutions, the destruction of social and economic infrastructure, and massive internal and external migrations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;World Bank Advisory Committee for Somalia [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/03/25/000112742_20040325090551/Rendered/PDF/282760Somalia0Country0reengagement0note.pdf Country Re-Engagement Note (pdf)] (2003), retrived [[4 November]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An essential element of anarcho-capitalist theory is that private businesses should protect individual liberty and property rather than tax-funded institutions. As such, the Somali situation falls short of being anarcho-capitalism as it is it is severely lacking in such options. Though some urban areas such as Mogadishu have private police and are relatively safe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netnomad.com/crigler.html ''Return to Somalia'']&lt;/ref&gt;, crime is rampant in other areas according to some [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/somalia/default.stm news reports]. Businessmen in Mogadishu have organized to fund private police that patrol the city streets for petty crime&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petermaass.com/core.cfm?p=1&amp;mag=51&amp;magtype=1 ''Ayn Rand Comes to Somalia'']&lt;/ref&gt;. There is a rudimentary legal system which has been called &quot;a free market for the supply, adjudication and enforcement of law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;van Notten, Michael (2000) [http://www.liberalia.com/htm/mvn_stateless_somalis.htm From Nation-State To Stateless Nation: The Somali Experience], Retrieved [[12 August]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; It remains to be seen if private solutions develop to the point of providing high-quality security.

While most of what was Somalia is a stateless area, two internationally unrecognized democratic states exist in its north. These are [[Somaliland]] and [[Puntland]], which are ruled by governments. These regions lack the armed competition in the more anarchic south, and the destruction this causes. Their people are correspondingly more prosperous on average. This is seen by many as evidence that competition in security should not be allowed.

==Criticisms of anarcho-capitalism==
:''For critiques of libertarianism in general, see: [[Criticism of libertarianism]]''
:''For critiques of capitalism from an anarchist (libertarian socialist) perspective, see: [[Anarchism and capitalism]]''
:''For the spectrum of political ideologies in relation to capitalism see: [[Capitalism and related political ideologies]]''

Anarcho-capitalism is a radical development of liberalism.  Therefore, the same general arguments for and against [[liberalism]], [[laissez-faire capitalism]] and [[capitalism]] apply, excepting those points (such as the justice system) where anarcho-capitalism diverges from the classical liberal tradition.

===Practical questions=== 
Critics often assert that anarcho-capitalism will degenerate into [[plutocracy]] or [[feudalism]] in practice.  They argue that it is a rational economic decision for organizations with the ability to exert coercion (private police, security and military forces) to exploit groups with less power. In this kind of environment, [[piracy]], military [[imperialism]], and [[slavery]] can be very profitable.  Taken to its logical extreme, this argument assumes that allowing such &quot;security&quot; organizations to exert coercive power will inevitably lead to their becoming a ''de facto'' state.  

The anarcho-capitalist would respond that in the absence of what they call &quot;victim disarmament&quot; ([[gun control]]), such domination would be expensive even for the most powerful, who would instead prefer peaceful trade with all.  Skeptics often feel that anarcho-capitalists rely on &quot;market solutions&quot; to the point of ridiculousness.&lt;ref&gt;Chisari, Michael - &quot;Anarchy List&quot; [[5 October]] [[1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Battle strike 1934.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Violence on a picket line. Critics of anarcho-capitalism argue that private ownership of capital and the pursuit of profit are exploitative, leading to class divisions and conflict.]]

[[Minarchism|Minarchist]] and [[statism|statist]] critics often argue that the [[free rider problem]] makes anarcho-capitalism (and, by extension, any anti-statist political system) fundamentally unworkable in modern societies. They typically argue that there are some vital goods or services — such as civil or military defense, management of common environmental resources, or the provision of [[public good]]s such as roads or lighthouses — that cannot be effectively delivered without the backing of a government exercising effective territorial control, and so that abolishing the state as anarcho-capitalists demand will either lead to catastrophe or to the eventual re-establishment of monopoly governments as a necessary means to solving the [[coordination problem]]s that the abolition of the state created.  One counterargument by free market economists, such as [[Alex Tabarrok]], emphasizes the private use of [[assurance contracts|dominant assurance contracts]]. Some anarcho-capitalists also contend that the &quot;problem&quot; of &quot;public goods&quot; is illusory and its invocation merely misunderstands the potential individual production of such goods.  Others, such as David Friedman, point out that problems of market failure are the exception in private markets but the norm in the [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/mps_iceland_talk/Iceland%20MP%20talk.htm political markets] that control state action.

[[Robert Nozick]] argued in ''Anarchy, State and Utopia'' that anarcho-capitalism would inevitably transform into a minarchist state, even without violating any of its own nonaggression principles, through the eventual emergence of a single locally dominant private defense and judicial agency that it is in everyone's interests to align with, because other agencies are unable to effectively compete against the advantages of the agency with majority coverage.  Therefore, he felt that, even to the extent that the anarcho-capitalist theory is correct, it results in an unstable system that would not endure in the real world.

===Moral questions===
Anarcho-capitalists consider a choice or action to be &quot;voluntary&quot;, in a moral sense, so long as that choice or action is not influenced by coercion or fraud perpetrated by another individual.  They also believe that maintaining private property claims is always defensive so long as that property was obtained in a way they believe to be legitimate.  Thus, so long as an employee and employer agree to terms, employment is regarded as voluntary regardless of the circumstances of property restriction surrounding it.  Some critics say this ignores constraints on action due to both human and nonhuman factors, such as the need for food and shelter, and active restriction of both used and unused resources by those enforcing property claims.  Thus, if a person requires employment in order to feed and house himself, it is said that the employer-employee relationship cannot be voluntary, because the employer restricts the use of resources from the employee in such a way that he cannot meet his needs.  This is essentially a semantic argument over the term &quot;voluntary&quot;.  Anarcho-capitalists simply do not use the term in that latter sense in their philosophy, believing that sense to be morally irrelevant. Other critics argue that employment is involuntary because the distributions of wealth that make it necessary for some individuals to serve others by way of contract are supported by the enforcement of coercive private property systems.  This is a deeper argument relating to [[distributive justice]].  Some of these critics appeal to an end-state theory of justice, while anarcho-capitalists (and [[propertarian]]s in general) appeal to an entitlement theory.  Other critics regard private property itself to either be an aggressive institution or a potentially aggressive one, rather than necessarily a defensive one, and thus reject claims that relationships based on unequal private property relations could be &quot;voluntary&quot;.

Critics also point out that anarcho-capitalist ethics do not entail any positive moral obligation to help others in need (see ''[[altruism]]'', the ethical doctrine).  Like other [[right libertarianism|right libertarians]], anarcho-capitalists may argue that no such moral obligation exists or argue that if a moral obligation to help others does exist that there is an overarching moral obligation to refrain from initiating coercion on individuals to enforce it. Anarcho-capitalists believe that helping others should be a matter of free personal choice, and do not recognize any form of social obligation arising from an individual's presence in a society.  They, like all right libertarians, believe in a distinction between negative and positive rights in which [[negative rights]] should be recognized as being legitimate, and [[positive rights]] rejected.  Critics often dismiss this stance as being unethical or selfish, or reject the legitimacy of the distinction between positive and negative rights. (Critics thereby redefine selfish to not include forcing other people to do what you want and disregarding the wishes of others.)

[[Property]] ownership rights and their extent are a source of contention among different philosophies.  Most see the rights as less absolute than anarcho-capitalists do.  The main issues are what kinds of things are valid property, and what constitutes abandonment of property.  The first is contentious even among anarcho-capitalists: there is disagreement over the validity of intellectual property&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy (1995) [http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/libhe/libhe014.htm Intellectual Property:The Late Nineteenth Century Libertarian Debate] Libertarian Heritage No. 14 ISBN 1856372812 Retrieved [[24 June]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; — intangible goods that are not economically scarce.  Some supporters of private property but critics of anarcho-capitalism may question whether unused land is valid property ([[Agorism]], [[Georgism]], [[geolibertarianism]], [[individualist anarchism]]).  The second issue is a common objection among socialists who do not believe in absentee ownership.  Anarcho-capitalists have strong abandonment criteria — one maintains ownership (more or less) until one agrees to trade or gift it.  The critics of this view tend to have weaker abandonment criteria; for example, one loses ownership (more or less) when one stops personally using it.  Also, the idea of original appropriation is anathema to most types of [[socialism]], as well as any philosophy that takes common ownership of land and [[natural resources]] as a premise.  There are also philosophies that view any ownership claims on land and natural resources as immoral and illegitimate, thus rejecting anarcho-capitalism as a philosophy that takes private ownership of land as a premise.

[[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] critics simply argue that anarcho-capitalism does not maximize utility, contending that it would fall far short of that goal. This kind of criticism comes from a variety of different political views and ideologies, and different critics have different views on which other system does or would do a better job of bringing the greatest benefits to the greatest number of people.  Anarcho-capitalists consider the nonaggression axiom to be a &quot;side-constraint&quot; on civilized human action&lt;ref name=Nozick-1973/&gt;, or a necessary condition for human society to be beneficial ([[Herbert Spencer]], Murray Rothbard), and thus should not be used as a trade-off for vague utilitarian values.  Another response, implied by [[Austrian economics]], is to argue that personal utility is not an [[additive]] quantity, therefore concluding that all utilitarian arguments, which invariably rely on aggregation of personal utilities, are logically and mathematically invalid.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Aristophanes.jpg|thumb|Bust of Aristophanes]]
'''Aristophanes''' (c. [[448 BC]]-[[380 BC]]; [[Greek language|Greek]] ΄Αριστοφανης) was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] comic dramatist.

The place and even exact date of his birth are unknown, but he was probably educated in [[Athens]]. He was from the Athenian deme of Kudathenaium. He is famous for writing comedies such as ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' for the two Athenian festivals: the [[Dionysia]] and the [[Lenea]]. He wrote forty plays, eleven of which still survive, and his plays are the only surviving examples of [[Old Attic Comedy]]. Many of his plays were [[political]], and often [[satire|satirized]] the well-known citizens of Athens and their conduct in the [[Peloponnesian War]]. He is known to have been prosecuted for Athenian law's equivalent of [[libel]] more than once. A famous comedy, ''[[The Frogs]]'', was given the unprecedented honor of a second performance.  According to a later biographer, he was also awarded a civic crown for &quot;[[The Frogs]]&quot;.

He appears in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', giving a humorous mythical account of the origin of [[Love]]. ''[[The Clouds]],'' a disastrous production resulting in a humiliating and long-remembered (cf. the revised parabasis of &quot;[[The Clouds]]&quot; and the parabasis of next year's &quot;[[The Wasps]]&quot;) last place finish at the City Dionysia, satirizes the new, sophistic learning en vogue among the aristocracy at the time; [[Socrates]] was the principal target and in the play he emerges as a typical [[Sophist]], no matter how inaccurate the portrayal may be. ''[[Lysistrata]]'' was written during the [[Peloponnesian War]] between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] and presents a [[pacifism|pacifist]] theme in a comical manner: the women of the two states show off their bodies and deprive their husbands of [[sex]] until they stop fighting. This play was later illustrated at length by [[Pablo Picasso]].

'''Albert Schweitzer''', [[Order of Merit|OM]], ([[January 14]], [[1875]] &amp;ndash; [[September 4]], [[1965]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[theology|theologian]], [[musician]], [[philosopher]], and [[physician]]. He was born in [[Kaysersberg]], [[Elsass-Lothringen]], [[Germany]] (now in [[Haut-Rhin]], [[Alsace]], [[France]]).  He received the [[1952]] [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in [[1953]].

==Theology==
As a young theologian his first major work, by which he gained a great reputation, was ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus'' (1906), in which he interpreted the life of [[Jesus]] in the light of Jesus' own [[eschatology|eschatological]] convictions. He established his reputation further as a [[New Testament]] scholar by other theological studies, like ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle'' (1930). In these studies he examined the eschatological beliefs of Paul and through this the message of the New Testament.

During his tenure as a priest for St. Nicholas church in [[Strasbourg]], he blessed the wedding of [[Theodor Heuss]], who was to become the first [[President|President of Germany]] of the [[German Federal Republic]].

==Music==
Albert Schweitzer was a famous organist in his day, and was highly interested in the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. He developed a simple style of performance, which he thought to be closer to what Bach had meant it to be. He based his interpretation mainly on his reassessment of Bach's religious intentions. Through the book &quot;Johann Sebastian Bach&quot;, the final version of which he completed in [[1908]], he advocated this new style, which has had great influence in the way Bach's music is now being treated. Albert Schweitzer was also a famous [[organ (music)|organ]] constructor. Recordings of Schweitzer playing the music of Bach are available on CDs.

==Philosophy==
Schweitzer's worldview was based on his idea of ''Reverence for Life'', which he believed to be his greatest single contribution to humankind. His view was that Western civilization was in decay because of gradually abandoning its ethical foundations - those of affirmation of life. 

It was his firm conviction that the respect for life is the highest principle. In a similar kind of exaltation of life to that of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], a recently influential philosopher of the time, Schweitzer admittedly followed the same line as that of the Russian [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Some people in his days compared his philosophy with that of [[Francis of Assisi]], a comparison he did not object to. In his ''Philosophy of Civilisation'' (all quotes in this section from Chapter 26 of the same book), he wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;True philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness: 'I am life that wants to live, in the midst of life that wants to live'. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Life and love in his view are based on, and follow out of the same principle: respect for every manifestation of Life, and a personal, spiritual relationship towards the universe. Ethics, according to Schweitzer, consists in the ''compulsion'' to show to the will-to-live of each and every being the same reverence as one does to one's own. In circumstances where we apparently fail to satisfy this compulsion should not lead us to defeatism, since the will-to-live renews itself again and again, as an outcome of an evolutionary necessity and a phenomenon with a spiritual dimension. 

However, as Schweitzer himself pointed out, it is neither impossible nor difficult to spend a life of not following it: the history of world philosophies and religions clearly shows many instances of denial of the principle of reverence for life. He points to the prevailing philosophy in the European middle ages, and the Indian Brahminic philosophy. Nevertheless, this kind of attitude lacks in genuineness. 

Since we enter the world, it offers us a horrible drama: it consists in the fact that the will to live, looked as a sum of all the individual wills, is divided against itself. One existence is antagonised against another, one destroys another. Only in the thinking being has the will to live become conscious of other will to live, and desirious of solidarity with it. This solidarity, however, cannot be brought about, because human life does not escape the puzzling and horrible circumstance that it must live at the cost of other life. But as an ethical being one strives to escape whenever possible from this necessity, and to put a stop to this disunion of the Will to live, so far as it is within one's power. 

Schweitzer advocated the concept of reverence for life widely throughout his entire life. The historical [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] waned and corrupted itself, Schweitzer held, because it has not been well enough grounded in thought, but compulsively followed the ethical will-to live. Hence, he looked forward to a renewed and more profound [[Rennaisance]] and Enlightenment of humanity (a view he expressed in the Epilogue of his ''Out of My Life and Thought''). Albert Schweitzer nourished hope in a humankind that is more profoundly aware of its position in the Universe. His optimism was based in &quot;belief in truth&quot;. &quot;The spirit generated by [conceiving of] truth is greater than the force of circumstances.&quot; He persistently emphasized the necessity to think, rather than merely acting on basis of passing impulses or by following the most widespread opinions. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Never for a moment do we lay aside our mistrust of the ideals established by society, and of the convictions which are kept by it in circulation. We always know that society is full of folly and will deceive us in the matter of humanity. [...] humanity meaning consideration for the existence and the happiness of individual human beings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Respect for life, resulting from contemplation on one's own conscious will to live, leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature.  

Schweitzer was very much respected for putting his theory into practice in his own life.

Schweitzer died in [[Gabon]], [[Africa]] after years of serving others as a physician in Africa.

==Stance on racial relations==
Schweitzer considered his work as a medical missionary in Africa to be his response
to Jesus' call to become &quot;fishers of men&quot; but also as a small 
recompense for the historic guilt of European colonizers: &quot;Who can describe the injustice and cruelties that in the course of centuries they [the coloured peoples] have suffered at the hands of Europeans? . . . If a record could be compiled of all that has happened between the white and the coloured races, it would make a book containing numbers of pages which the reader would have to turn over unread because their contents would be too horrible.&quot; [On the Edge of the Primeval Forest, p. 115].

Schweitzer was sometimes accused of being paternalistic or colonialist in his attitude towards Africans.  For instance, he thought Gabonese independence came too early, without adequate education or accommodation to local circumstances.  Edgar Berman quotes Schweitzer  speaking these lines in 1960: &quot;No society can go from the primeval directly to an industrial state without losing the leavening that time and an agricultural period allow.&quot; [In Africa With Schweitzer, p. 139]. [[Chinua Achebe]] has quoted Schweitzer as saying &quot;The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother.&quot; &lt;sup&gt;[http://social.chass.ncsu.edu/wyrick/debclass/achcon.htm]&lt;/sup&gt;, which Achebe criticized him for.

==Medicine==
Albert Schweitzer spent most of his life in Lambaréné in what is now [[Gabon]], Africa. After his medical studies in [[1913]],  he went there with his wife to establish a hospital near an already existing mission post. He treated and operated on literally thousands of people. He took care of hundreds of [[lepers|Leprosy]] and treated many victims of the African [[sleeping sickness]].

In [[1914]] [[World War I]] began and because he was a German on French territory,  Schweitzer and his wife were taken captive and temporarily confined to their house. In [[1917]] they were interned in Garaison, France, and in [[1918]] in [[Saint Remy de Provence]]. There he studied and wrote as much as possible in preparation for among others his famous book ''Culture and Ethics'' (published in [[1923]]). In July 1918 he was a free man again, and  while working as a medical assistant and assistant-pastor in [[Strasbourg]], he was able to finish the book. In the meantime he began to speak and lecture about his ideas wherever he was invited. Not only did he want his philosophy on [[culture]] and [[ethics]] to become widely known, it also served as a means to raise money for the hospital in Lambaréné, for which he had already emptied his own pockets.

In [[1924]] he returned to Lambaréné, where he managed to rebuild the decayed hospital, after which he resumed his medical practices. Soon he was no longer the only medical doctor in the hospital, and whenever possible he went to Europe to lecture at universities. Gradually his opinions and concepts became acknowledged, not only in Europe, but worldwide.

==Later life==
From [[1939]]-[[1948]] he stayed in Lambaréné, unable to go back to a Europe in war. Three years after the end of [[World War II]], in 1948, he returned for the first time to Europe and kept travelling back and forth (and once to the USA) as long as he could until his death in 1965. 

From 1952 until his death he worked against [[nuclear tests]] and [[nuclear weapon]]s with [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] . In 1957 and 1958 he broadcast four speeches  over Radio Oslo which were published in ''Peace or Atomic War''. In 1957, Schweitzer was one of the founders of [[SANE|The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy]].

His life was portrayed in the 1952 movie ''Il est minuit, Docteur Schweitzer'', starring [[Pierre Fresnay]] as Albert Schweitzer and [[Jeanne Moreau]] as his nurse Marie. His cousin Anne-Marie Schweitzer Sartre was the mother of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

He was [[chevalier]] of the [[Order of St Lazarus|Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem]].

He died on September 4, 1965 in [[Lambaréné]], [[Gabon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Template:Libertarianism}}The '''Austrian School''' is a school of [[history of economic thought|economic thought]] that rejects opposing economists' reliance on methods used in [[natural science]] for the study of human action, and instead bases its formalism of economics on relationships through logic or introspection called &quot;[[praxeology]]&quot;.

Its most famous adherents are [[Carl Menger]], [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], [[Friedrich von Wieser]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Murray Rothbard]], [[Israel Kirzner]] and [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]]. While often controversial, and standing to some extent outside of the mainstream of neoclassical theory &amp;mdash; as well as being staunchly against much of [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]' theory and its results &amp;mdash; the Austrian School has been widely influential because of its emphasis on the creative phase of economic productivity and their questioning of the basis of the behavioral theory underlying [[neoclassical economics]].

The Austrian School is generally associated with groups that label themselves [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]] or [[libertarian]] in their ideas of social, political and economic organization.

== History ==
[[Classical economics]] focused on the exchange theory of value. In late [[19th century]], however, there was a focus on the concept of the &quot;marginal&quot; cost and value. (See [[Marginalism]]).  Carl Menger's [[1871]] book, ''[[Principles of Economics]],'' is considered one of the crucial works that began the period known as [[neoclassical economics]]. While marginalism was generally influential, there was also a more specific school that grew up around Menger, which came to be known as the &quot;Vienna School&quot; or &quot;Austrian School&quot;. Austrian economics is currently closely associated with advocacy of radical ''[[laissez-faire]]'' views. However, earlier Austrian economists were more cautious compared to later economists such as [[Ludwig von Mises]], with [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] saying that he feared that unbridled free competition would lead to &quot;anarchism in production and consumption.&quot; However, the Austrian School, especially through the works of [[Friedrich Hayek]], would be influential in the revival of laissez-faire thought in the [[1980s]].

The school originated in [[Vienna]] and owes its name to members of the [[Historical School]] of [[economics]] who during the ''[[Methodenstreit]],'' where the Austrians defended the reliance that [[classical economics|classical economists]] placed on logic over observation. Their Prussian opponents derisively named them the &quot;Austrian School&quot; to emphasize a departure from mainstream German thought and to suggest a provincial approach.

Menger's contributions were closely followed by [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] and [[Friedrich von Wieser]]. [[Austria|Austrian]] economists developed a sense of themselves as a school distinct from [[neoclassical economics]] during the [[economic calculation debate]], with [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]] representing the Austrian position, where they contended that without monetary prices or private property, meaningful economic calculation was impossible. The Austrian economists were the first liberal economists to systematically challenge the [[Marxist]] school. This was partly a reaction to the ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' when they attacked the [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] doctrines of the [[Historical School]]. Though many Marxist authors have attempted to portray the Austrian school as a ''[[bourgeois]]'' reaction to Marx, such an interpretation is untenable: Menger wrote his ''[[Principles of Economics]]'' at almost the same time as [[Karl Marx|Marx]] was completing ''[[Das Kapital]].'' The Austrian economists were, however, the first to clash directly with Marxism, since both dealt with such subjects as money, [[capital (economics)|capital]], [[business cycle|business cycles]], and economic processes. Böhm-Bawerk wrote extensive critiques of Marx in the 1880s and 1890s, and several prominent Marxists &amp;mdash; including [[Rudolf Hilferding]] &amp;mdash; attended his seminar in 1905&amp;ndash;06. In contrast, the classical economists had shown little interest in such topics, and many of them did not even gain familiarity with Marx's ideas until well into the twentieth century.

The school was no longer centered in Austria after [[Hitler]] came to power. Austrian economics was ill-thought of by most economists after [[World War II]] due to its rejection of observational methods. Its reputation has lately risen with work by students of [[Israel Kirzner]] and [[Ludwig Lachmann]], as well as an interest in Hayek after he won the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]]. However, it remains a distinctly minority position, even in such areas as capital value.

Austrian economics can be broken into two general trends. One, exemplified by Hayek, while distrusting of many neoclassical concepts, generally accepts their formulations, the other exemplified by the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], seeks a different formalism for [[economics]]. The primary areas of contention between neoclassical theory and the Austrian school are on the possibility of consumer indifference &amp;mdash; neoclassical theory says it is possible, where as Mises rejected it as being &quot;impossible to observe in practice&quot; &amp;mdash; and when Mises and his students argued that utility functions are ordinal, and not cardinal; that is, one can only rank preferences and not measure their intensity. Finally there are a host of questions about uncertainty raised by Mises and other Austrians, who argue for a different means of [[risk assessment]].

An area that is often overlooked is the influence that Austrian school ideas have had on Keynesian [[macroeconomics]]. The source of this influence is the period of time where the [[London School of Economics]] brought in Hayek and other &quot;continental&quot; economists. While their students &quot;flew the coop&quot;, refusing to join the Austrian school, many of the concepts, particularly relating time to the value of capital and its importance, would find their way into the work of Keynesians such as [[John Hicks]].  [[Alan Greenspan]], speaking of the originators of the School, said in 2000, &quot;the Austrian school have reached far into the future from when most of them practiced and have had a profound and, in my judgment, probably an irreversible effect on how most mainstream economists think in this country.&quot; The long-time U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman said he attended a seminar hosted by Ludwig von Mises. [http://www.usagold.com/gildedopinion/greenspan-gold.html]

== Analytical framework ==
Austrian economists reject observation as a tool applicable to economics, saying that while it is appropriate in the natural sciences where factors can be isolated in laboratory conditions, acting human beings are too complex for this treatment. Instead one should isolate the logical processes of human action - a discipline named &quot;[[praxeology]]&quot; by [[Ludwig von Mises]].

Austrians view [[entrepreneurship]] as the driving force in [[economic development]], see [[private property]] as essential to the efficient use of resources, and often see government interference in market processes as counterproductive.

As with neoclassical economists, Austrians reject [[classical economics|classical]] cost of production theories, most famously the [[labor theory of value]]. Instead they explain value by reference to the subjective preferences of individuals. This psychological aspect to Menger's economics has been attributed to the school's birth in turn of the century [[Vienna]]. [[Supply and demand]] are explained by aggregating over the decisions of individuals, following the precepts of [[methodological individualism]], which asserts that only individuals and not collectives make decisions, and [[marginalist]] arguments, which compare the costs and benefits for incremental changes.

Contemporary neo-Austrian economists claim to adopt [[economic subjectivism]] more consistently than any other school of economics and reject many neoclassical formalisms. For example, while neoclassical economics formalizes the economy as an [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] system with supply and demand in balance, Austrian economists emphasize its dynamic, perpetually dis-equilibrated nature.

The core of the Austrian framework can be summarized as taking a subjectivist approach to marginal economics, and a focus on the idea that theory should absolutely overrule observation. Austrians focus completely on the [[opportunity cost]] of goods, as opposed to balancing downside or disutility costs. It is an Austrian assertion that everyone is ''better'' off in a mutually voluntary exchange, or they would not have carried it out. A fuller explanation of this in more exact terms is [http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/margrev/oppcost.htm available at the New School's economic pages].

This focus on opportunity cost alone means that their interpretation of the [[time value]] of a good has a strict relationship: since goods will be as restricted by scarcity at a later point in time as they are now, the strict relationship between investment and time must also hold. A factory making goods next year is worth as much less as the goods it is making next year are worth. This means that the business cycle is driven by miscoordination between sectors of the same economy, caused by money not carrying incentive information correct about present choices, rather than within a single economy where money causes people to make bad decisions about how to spend their time. This means, in the Austrian context, the correct way to prevent imbalances in the economy is to make people want to buy the correct goods, rather than controlling when people buy goods.

== Contributions ==
Some contributions of Austrian economists:

* A theory of distribution in which factor [[price]]s result from the [[imputation (economics)|imputation]] of prices of consumer goods to goods of &quot;higher order&quot;, that is goods used in the production of consumer goods (goods of the first order).
* An emphasis on [[opportunity cost]] and reservation demand in defining [[marginal theory of value|value]], and a refusal to consider supply as an otherwise independent cause of value. (The British economist [[Philip Wicksteed]] adopted this perspective.)
* An emphasis on the forward-looking nature of choice, seeing time as the root of uncertainty within economics (see also [[time preference]]).
* A fundamental rejection of mathematical methods in economics seeing the function of economics as investigating the essences rather than the specific quantities of economic phenomena. This was seen as an evolutionary, or &quot;genetic-causal&quot;, approach against the stresses of [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and [[perfect competition]] found in mainstream Neoclassical economics (see also [[praxeology]]).
* [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]]'s critique of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] centered around the untenability of the [[labor theory of value]] in the light of the [[transformation problem]]. There was also the connected argument that capitalists do not exploit workers; they accommodate workers by providing them with income well in advance of the revenue from the output they helped to produce.
* [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]]'s capital theory, which equates [[capital intensity]] with the degree of [[roundaboutness]] of production processes.
* The Mises-Hayek [[business cycle]] theory, which explains depression as a reaction to an intertemporal production structure fostered by [[monetary policy]] setting [[interest rate]]s inconsistent with individual time preferences.
* Hayek's concept of [[intertemporal equilibrium]]. ([[John Hicks]] took over this theory in his discussion of temporary equilibrium in ''Value and Capital,'' a book very influential on the development of neoclassical economics after World War II.)
* Mises and Hayek's view of prices as permitting agents to make use of [[dispersed knowledge|dispersed tacit knowledge]].
* The [[time preference theory of interest]], which explains interest rates through [[intertemporal choice]] - the different time preferences of the borrower or lender - rather than as a price paid for a [[factor of production]].
* Stressing uncertainty in the making of economic decisions, rather than relying on &quot;[[Homo economicus]]&quot; or the rational man who was fully informed of all circumstances impinging on his decisions. The fact that perfect knowledge never exists, means that all economic activity implies risk.
* Seeing the entrepreneurs' role as collecting and evaluating information and acting on risks.
* The [[economic calculation debate]] between Austrian and [[Marxist]] economists, with the Austrians claiming that Marxism is flawed because prices could not be set to recognize opportunity costs of factors of production, and so [[socialism]] could not calculate best uses in the same way [[capitalism]] does.

      <comment>/* Perianal abscess */ wiki</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Abszess.jpg|thumb|Abscess]]
An '''abscess''' is a collection of [[pus]] collected in a cavity formed by the tissue on the basis of an [[infection|infectious]] process (usually caused by [[bacterium|bacteria]] or [[parasite]]s) or other foreign materials (e.g. splinters or bullet wounds). It is a [[immune system|defensive reaction]] of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the body.

The organisms or foreign materials that gain access to a part of tissue kill the local [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, release toxins and trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]] by drawing huge amounts of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increasing the regional [[blood]] flow. So, pus is a collection of local dead tissue cells, white blood cells, infecting organisms or foreign material and toxins released by both organisms and blood cells. The final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to build a barrier around the pus that limits the infected material from neighbouring structures. 

==Manifestations==
The cardinal symptoms and signs of any kind of inflammatory process are redness, heat, swelling and pain. Abscesses may occur in any kind of solid tissue but most frequently on skin surface (where they may be superficial pustules ([[boil]]s) or deep skin abscesses), in the lungs, [[brain abscess|brain]], kidneys and tonsils.  Major complications are spreading of the abscess material to adjacent or remote tissues and extensive regional tissue death ([[gangrene]]).  Abscesses in most parts of the body rarely heal themselves, so prompt medical attention is indicated at the first suspicion of an abscess.

==Treatment==
The abscess should be inspected to identify if foreign objects are a cause, requiring surgical removal.  [[Surgery|Surgical]] drainage of the abscess (e.g. [[Lancing (Surgical Procedure)|lancing]]) is usually indicated once the abscess has developed from a harder serous inflammation to a softer [[pus]] stage.  As ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' [[bacteria]] is a common cause, an anti-Staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[Flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used .  It is important to note that [[antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective.  In critical areas where surgery presents a high risk (such as the [[brain]]), surgery may be delayed or used as a last resort.  The drainage of the lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for skin abscess.

==Perianal abscess==
Perianal abscesses can be seen in patients with for example [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (such as [[Crohn's disease]]) or [[diabetes]].  Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration or hard stool.  This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess.  This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the [[anus]] which grows larger and more painful with the passage of time.  

Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and debridement or [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''''Abwehr''''' was a [[Germany|German]] [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] organization from [[1921]] to [[1944]]. The verb ''abwehren'' means &quot;to ward off&quot;, implying [[counterespionage]]; this term was used as a concession to [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] demands that Germany's post-[[World War I]] intelligence activities be for &quot;defensive&quot; purposes only. After [[February 4]], [[1938]], its name in full was '''''Amt Ausland/Abwehr im Oberkommando der Wehrmacht''''' (Foreign Bureau/Defence of the Armed Forces High Command).

Despite its name, the purpose of the Abwehr was to obtain military intelligence concerning nations of interest to the German government. Its headquarters were located at 76/78 Tirpitzufer in [[Berlin]], adjacent to the offices of the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (OKW).

==The Abwehr before Canaris==
The Abwehr was created in 1921 as part of the [[Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Ministry of Defence]] when Germany was allowed to form the [[Reichswehr]], the [[Armed Forces|military organization]] of the [[Weimar Republic]]. The first head was Major Friedrich Gempp, a former deputy to [[Walther Nicolai|Col. Walther Nicolai]], the head of German inteligence during World War I. At that time it was composed of only three officers and seven former officers plus a clerical staff. By the [[1920s]] it was organized into three sections:

*I. [[Reconnaissance]]
*II. [[Cipher]] and Radio Monitoring
*III. Counterespionage

The [[German Navy|German Navy's]] intelligence staff merged with the Abwehr in [[1928]].

In the [[1930s]], with the rise of the [[Nazi]] movement, the Ministry of Defence was reorganized; surprisingly, on [[June 7]], [[1932]], a naval officer, Capt. Konrad Patzig, was named chief of the Abwehr, despite the fact that it was staffed largely by Army officers. But perhaps not surprisingly, due to the small size of the organization and its limited importance at that time, it was unsuitable for a more ambitious Army officer. Another possible factor was that naval officers had more foreign experience than their Army counterparts and understood more of foreign affairs. However, all three services eventually developed their own intelligence staff.

Because of Abwehr-sponsored reconnaissance flights across the border with [[Poland]], Patzig soon had confrontations with [[Heinrich Himmler]], head of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Army leaders feared that the flights would endanger the secret plans for an attack on Poland. Patzig was fired in January [[1935]] as a result, and was sent to command the new [[pocket battleship]] ''[[Admiral Graf Spee]]''; he later became Chief of Naval Personnel. His replacement was another Reichsmarine captain, [[Wilhelm Canaris]].

==The Abwehr under Canaris==
===Before the War===
[[Image:Wilhelmcanaris.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Wilhelm Canaris]]

Before he took over the Abwehr on [[January 1]], the soon-to-be Admiral Canaris was warned by Patzig of attempts by Himmler and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] to take over all German intelligence organs. Canaris, a master of backroom dealings which were so much a part of life, thought he knew how to deal with them. But even while he tried to maintain an at-least cordial relationship with them, the antagonism between the Abwehr and the SS did not stop with Canaris at the helm.

It came to a head in [[1937]] when [[Adolf Hitler]] decided to help [[Josef Stalin]] in the latter's purge against the [[Red Army|Soviet military]]. Hitler ordered that the German Army staff should be kept in the dark about Stalin's intentions, for fear that they would warn their Soviet counterparts.  Accordingly, special SS teams, accompanied by burglary experts from the criminal police, broke into the secret files of the General Staff and the Abwehr and removed documents related to German-Soviet collaboration. To conceal the thefts, fires were started at the break-ins, which included Abwehr headquarters.

When Hitler replaced the [[Ministry of War]] with the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), the Abwehr became its intelligence agency, although with some degree of independence therefrom. Canaris reorganized the agency in [[1938]], establishing the following major departments, which existed until its dissolution:

* I. [[Espionage]]
** '''G'''      false documents
** '''H West''' army west (Anglo-American intelligence)
** '''H Ost'''  army east (Soviet intelligence)
** '''Ht'''     army technical
** '''i'''      communications
** '''L'''      airforce
** '''M'''      naval
** '''T/Lw'''   technical air force
** '''W'''      economics
* II. [[Sabotage]] and special tasks
* III. Counterespionage

Both Army and Navy officers headed these sections.

In this reorganizaton, Canaris took care to surround himself with a hand-picked staff, notably his second-in-command, [[Hans Oster]] and [[Erwin Lahousen|Erwin von Lahousen]], Section II Chief. All but one were not members of the Nazi party. The exception was Rudolf Bamler, who was appointed as chief of Section III to cement Himmler's trust in him, but Canaris made sure to keep a tight leash on him and gave him limited access to operational information.

===The Abwehr During World War II===
Under Canaris the Abwehr expanded and proved relatively efficient during the early years of the war. Its most notable success was [[Operation Nordpol]], which was an operation against the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] underground network, which at the time was supported by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Special Operations Executive]]. In March [[1941]], the Germans forced a captured SOE radio operator to transmit messages to Britain in a code that the Germans had obtained. Even though the operator gave every indication that he was compromised, the receiver in Britain did not notice this. Thus the Germans had been able to penetrate the Dutch operation and maintained this state of affairs for two years, capturing agents that were sent and sending false intelligence and [[sabotage]] reports until the British caught on.

But it was ineffective overall for several reasons. Much of its intelligence was deemed politically unacceptable to the German leadership. Moreover, it was in direct competition/conflict with SS intelligence activities under Reinhard Heydrich and [[Walter Schellenberg]]. The animosity between the SS and Abwehr did not stop there. Many of the Abwehr's operatives — including Canaris himself — were in fact anti-Nazi and were involved in many assassination attempts against Hitler, including the most serious one on [[July 20 Plot|July 20, 1944]]. Canaris even employed [[Jew]]s in the Abwehr and used the agency to help a small number of Jews to escape from Germany into [[Switzerland]]. But perhaps the biggest reason was that Canaris himself sought to undermine the Nazi cause. 

Despite the Abwehr's many intelligence coups, its effectiveness was more than negated by agents who — with Canaris's blessing — aided the Allies in whatever covert means were necessary. He personally gave false information which discouraged Hitler from invading [[Switzerland]]. He also persuaded [[Francisco Franco]] not to allow German forces to pass through Spain to invade [[Gibraltar]]. He even provided intelligence to the Allies on German intentions as well. 

The SS continually undermined the Abwehr by putting several Abwehr officers under investigation, believing them (correctly) to be involved in anti-Hitler plots.  The SS also accused Canaris of being defeatist in his intelligence assessments, especially on the Russian campaign. One such briefing reportedly resulting in Hitler seizing Canaris by the lapels, and demanding to know whether the intelligence chief was insinuating that Germany would lose the war.

===The Frau Solf Tea Party and the End of the Abwehr===
{{main|Frau Solf Tea Party}}
The incident which eventually resulted in the dissolution of the Abwehr came to be known as the &quot;[[Frau Solf Tea Party]]&quot;, which took place on [[September 10]], [[1943]].

Frau Johanna (or Hanna) Solf, the widow of Dr. [[Wilhelm Solf]], a former Colonial Minister under [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] and ex-[[Ambassador]] to [[Japan]], had long been involved in the anti-Nazi intellectual movement in Berlin. At a tea party hosted by her, a new member was included in the circle, an attractive young Swiss doctor named Reckse. It turned out that Dr. Reckse was an agent of the [[Gestapo]], to which he reported on the tea party and turned over several incriminating documents. 

The Solf circle was tipped off and had to flee for their lives, but they were all rounded up on [[January 12]], [[1944]]. Eventually everyone who was involved in the Solf Circle except Frau Solf and her daughter, the Countess [[Lagi Gräfin von Ballestrem]], were executed.

One of those executed was Otto Kiep, an official in the Foreign Office, who had friends in the Abwehr, among whom were [[Erich Vermehren]] and his wife, the former [[Countess Elizabeth von Plettenberg]], who were stationed as agents in [[Istanbul]]. Both were summoned to Berlin by the Gestapo in connection with the Kiep case. Fearing for their lives, they contacted the British and defected.

It was mistakenly believed in Berlin that the Vermehrens absconded with the Abwehr's secret codes and turned them over to the British. That proved to be the last straw for Hitler. Despite the efforts of the Abwehr to shift the blame to the SS or even to the Foreign Ministry, Hitler had had enough of Canaris and he told [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] so twice. He summoned the chief of the Abwehr for a final interview and accused him of allowing the Abwehr to &quot;fall into bits&quot;. Canaris quietly agreed that it was &quot;not surprising&quot;, as Germany was already losing the war.

Hitler fired Canaris on the spot, and on [[February 18]], [[1944]], Hitler signed a decree that abolished the Abwehr. Its functions were taken over by the [[RSHA]]. This action deprived the armed forces (and the anti-Nazi conspirators) of an intelligence service of its own and strengthened Himmler's control over the generals.

Canaris, by this time a [[vice admiral]], was cashiered and given the empty position of chief of the Office of Commercial and Economic Warfare. He was arrested on [[July 23]], [[1944]] in the aftermath of the [[July 20 Plot]] against Hitler and executed shortly before the end of the war, along with Oster his deputy.  The functions of the Abwehr were then totally absorbed by the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'', a sub-office of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) security command, the [[RSHA]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:mesaverde_cliffpalace_20030914.752.jpg|thumb|300px|Cliff Palace, Mesa Verde National Park]]
'''Ancient Pueblo People''', or '''Ancestral Puebloans''' is a preferred term for the cultural group of people often known as '''Anasazi''' who are the ancestors of the modern [[Pueblo people]]s.  The ancestral Puebloans were a [[prehistoric]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] civilization centered around the present-day [[Four Corners (United States)|Four Corners]] area of the [[Southwest United States]].  [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] still debate when a distinct [[culture]] emerged, but the current consensus, based on terminology defined by the [[Pecos Classification]], suggests their emergence around [[12th century BC|1200 B.C.]], the [[Pecos Classification#Early Basketmaker II Era|Basketmaker II Era]].

The civilization is perhaps best-known for the [[jacal]], [[adobe]] and [[sandstone]] dwellings that they built along cliff walls, particularly during the [[Pecos Classification#Pueblo II Era|Pueblo II]] and [[Pecos Classification#Pueblo III Era|Pueblo III]] eras. The best-preserved examples of those dwellings are in [[National parks (United States)|parks]] such as [[Chaco Canyon|Chaco Culture National Historical Park]], [[Mesa Verde National Park]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], [[Bandelier National Monument]], and [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument]].  These [[village]]s, called [[pueblo]]s by [[Mexico|Mexican]] settlers, were often only accessible by rope or through [[rock climbing]].

The Ancestral Puebloans are also known for their unique style of [[pottery]], today considered valuable for their rarity.  They also created many [[petroglyph]]s and [[pictograph]]s.

The Ancestral Puebloans migrated from their ancient homeland for several complex reasons.  These may include pressure from [[Numic]]-speaking peoples moving onto the Colorado Plateau as well as climate change which resulted in [[agriculture|agricultural]] failures.   Confirming evidence for climatic change in North America is found in excavations of western regions in the Mississippi Valley between A.D. 1150 and 1350 which show long lasting patterns of warmer, wetter winters and cooler, dryer summers.  Most modern Pueblo peoples (whether Keresans, Hopi, or Tanoans) and historians like James W. Loewen, in his book ''Lies Across America'', assert these people did not &quot;vanish,&quot; as is commonly portrayed, but merged into the various pueblo peoples whose descendants still live in [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]].  This perspective is not new and was also presented in reports from early 20th century anthropologists, including [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]], [[J. Walter Fewkes]] and [[Alfred V. Kidder]]. Many modern Pueblo tribes trace their lineage from settlements in the Anasazi area and areas inhabited by their cultural neighbors, the [[Mogollon]].  For example, the San Ildefonso [[Pueblo people]] believe that their ancestors lived in both the [[Mesa Verde]] area and the current [[Bandelier National Monument|Bandelier]].
  
==Anasazi as a cultural label==
The term &quot;Anasazi&quot; was established in archaeological terminology through the Pecos Classification system in 1927.  Archaeologist Linda Cordell discussed the word's etymology and use:  
:&quot;''The name &quot;Anasazi&quot; has come to mean &quot;ancient people,&quot; although the word itself is [[Navajo language|Navajo]],  meaning &quot;enemy ancestors.&quot;'' [The Navajo word is ''anaasází'' (&lt;''anaa-'' &quot;enemy&quot;, ''sází'' &quot;ancestor&quot;).] ''It is unfortunate that a non-Pueblo word has come to stand for a tradition that is certainly ancestral Pueblo. The term was first applied to ruins of the Mesa Verde by [[Richard Wetherill]], a rancher and trader who, in 1888-1889, was the first Anglo-American to explore the sites in that area. Wetherill knew and worked with Navajos and understood what the word meant. The name was further sanctioned in archaeology when it was adopted by Alfred V. Kidder, the acknowledged dean of Southwestern Archaeology. Kidder felt that is was less cumbersome than a more technical term he might have used. Subsequently some archaeologists who would try to change the term have worried that because the Pueblos speak different languages, there are different words for &quot;ancestor,&quot; and using one might be offensive to people speaking other languages.''

Some modern Pueblo peoples object to the use of the term ''Anasazi'', although there is still controversy among them on a native alternative. The modern Hopi use the word &quot;''Hisatsinom''&quot; in preference to Anasazi.  However, Navajo Nation Historic Preservation Department (NNHPD) spokeman Ronald Maldonado has indicated the Navajo do not favor use of the term &quot;Ancestral Puebloan.&quot; In fact, reports submitted for review by NNHPD are rejected if they include use of the term.

==Cultural divisions==
Archaeological cultural units such as &quot;Anasazi&quot;, [[Hohokam]], [[Patayan]] or Mogollon are used by [[archaeologists]] to define material culture similarities and differences that may identify prehistoric socio-cultural units which may be understood as equivalent to modern tribes, societies or peoples. The names and divisions are classificatory devices based on theoretical perspectives, analytical methods and data available at the time of analysis and publication.  They are subject to change, not only on the basis of new information and discoveries, but also as attitudes and perspectives change within the scientific community.  It should not be assumed that an archaeological division or culture unit corresponds to a particular language group or to a socio-political entity such as a ''tribe''. 

When making use of modern cultural divisions in the American Southwest, it is important to understand three limitations in the current conventions:
*Archaeological research focuses on items left behind during people&amp;#8217;s activities; fragments of pottery vessels, human remains, stone tools or evidence left from the construction of dwellings.  However, many other aspects of the culture of prehistoric peoples are not tangible.  [[Language]]s spoken by these people and their beliefs and behavior are difficult to decipher from physical materials.  Cultural divisions are tools of the modern scientist, and so should not be considered similar to divisions or relationships the ancient residents may have recognized.  Modern cultures in this region, many of whom claim some of these ancient people as ancestors, contain a striking range of diversity in lifestyles, social organization, language and religious beliefs.  This suggests the ancient people were also more diverse than their material remains may suggest.

*The modern term &amp;#8220;style&amp;#8221; has a bearing on how material items such as pottery or [[architecture]] can be interpreted.  Within a people, different means to accomplish the same goal can be adopted by subsets of the larger group.  For example, in modern Western cultures, there are alternative styles of [[clothing]] that characterized older and younger generations.  Some cultural differences may be based on linear traditions, on teaching from one generation or &amp;#8220;school&amp;#8221; to another.  Other varieties in style may have distinguished between arbitrary groups within a culture, perhaps defining [[status]], [[gender]], [[clan]] or [[guild]] affiliation, religious belief or cultural alliances. Variations may also simply reflect the different resources available in a given time or area.
 
*Defining cultural groups, such as the Ancient Pueblo peoples, tends to create an image of territories separated by clear-cut boundaries, like modern state lines.  These simply did not exist. ''Prehistoric people traded, worshipped and collaborated most often with other nearby groups.  Cultural differences should therefore be understood as ''“clinal”'', &quot;increasing gradually as the distance separating groups also increases.&quot;'' (Plog, p. 72.)  Departures from the expected pattern may occur because of unidentified social or political situations or because of geographic barriers.  In the Southwest, mountain ranges, rivers and, most obviously, the [[Grand Canyon]] can be significant barriers for human communities, likely reducing the frequency of contact with other groups.  Current opinion holds that the closer cultural similarity between the Mogollon and Ancient Pueblos and their greater differences from the [[Hohokam]] and [[Patayan]] is due to both the geography and the variety of climate zones in the Southwest.

'''Aalborg''' is a municipality ([[Danish language|Danish]], ''[[Commune (subnational entity)|kommune]]'') in [[North Jutland County]] on the [[Jutland]] peninsula in northern [[Denmark]].  The municipality straddles the [[Limfjord]], the waterway which connects the [[North Sea]] and the [[Kattegat]] east-to-west, and which separates the main body of the Jutland peninsula from the island of [[Vendsyssel-Thy]] north-to-south.  

It is also the name of the municipality's main city and the site of its municipal council, as well as the name of a [[seaport]].  

The municipality and the town have chosen to retain the traditional spelling of the name as ''Aalborg'', although the new spelling ''Ålborg'' is used in other contexts, such as Ålborg Bay (''Ålborg Bugt''), the body of water which lies to the east of the Jutland peninsula.

The municipality, which includes the island of [[Egholm]], covers an area of 560 [[square kilometre|km²]], and has a total population of 192,353 (2005).  The mayor of the municipality is Henning G. Jensen, a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (''Socialdemokraterne'') [[Politics of Denmark|political party]].

Neighboring municipalities are [[Sejlflod]] and [[Hals]] to the east, [[Dronninglund]] and [[Brønderslev]] to the north, [[Aabybro]] and [[Nibe]] to the west, and [[Støvring]] and [[Skørping]] to the south.  The waters splitting the municipality are called ''Langerak'' to the east and ''Gjøl Bredning'' to the west.  The island of Egholm is located in ''Gjøl Bredning'', and is connected by [[ferry]] to the city of Aalborg at its southern shore. 

By [[January 1]], [[2007]] Aalborg municipality will, as the result of [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipality Reform 2007|''Kommunalreformen'' (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007)]], be merged with existing [[Hals]], [[Nibe]], and [[Sejlflod]] municipalities to form the new Aalborg municipality.  This will create a municipality with an area of 1,171 [[square kilometre|km²]].  The new municipality will belong to the new [[Region Nordjylland]] (&quot;North Jutland Region&quot;).

==Surroundings==
The area is typical for the north of Jutland.  To the west the Limfjord broadens into an irregular lake (salt water), with low, marshy shores and many islands.  Northwest is [[Store Vildmose]] (&quot;Greater Wild bog&quot;), a swamp where a mirage is sometimes seen in summer. Southeast lies the similar [[Lille Vildmose]] (&quot;Lesser Wild bog&quot;).  Store Vildmose was drained and farmed in the beginning of the 20th century, and Lille Vildmose is now the largest [[Bog|moor]] in Denmark.

==The city of Aalborg==
The city of Aalborg is the fourth largest city in Denmark— after [[Copenhagen]], [[Aarhus]] and [[Odense]].  It is the location of [[Aalborg Air Base]], an important base of the [[Danish Air Force|Danish air force]], and is the seat of a [[Lutheran]] [[bishop]]. 

Railway connects Aalborg with [[Hjørring]], [[Frederikshavn]], and [[Skagen]] to the north, and with [[Aarhus]] and the lines from [[Germany]] to the south, as well as to [[Copenhagen]] in the east over the island of [[Funen]].

The harbour is good and safe, though fairly difficult to access.

===History===
Aalborg traces its history back over 1000 years.  It was originally settled as a trading post, because of its position on the Limfjord. The sites of what were two settlements and a visible burial ground can be seen on [[Lindholm Høje]], a hill overlooking the city.  The size of these settlements emphasise the significance of this place as a crossroads.

The first mention of Aalborg under its original name ''Alabu'', is found on a coin dated to 1040. 

During the [[Middle Ages]], Aalborg prospered and became one of the largest cities in Denmark.  This prosperity was further enhanced when in [[1516]] Aalborg was granted a [[monopoly]] in salt herring. 

Aalborg received town privileges in [[1342]] and the bishopric dates from [[1554]].

During the German invasion of Denmark in 1940, the Aalborg Aerodrome was captured by Nazi paratroopers very early in the action.

===Industry===
Aalborg is a growing industrial and commercial centre, exporting grain, cement and fish. 

It is home to [[De Danske Spritfabrikker]]'s (&quot;Danish Distillers&quot;) [[akvavit|aquavit]] [[snaps]], production facility for the distillation of the Aalborg family of akvavits consisting of 17 different brands.  Danish Distillers is Scandinavia's largest producer and supplier of spirits for consumption, and is the world's largest producer and exporter of aquavit, supplying over 140 geographic markets.

It is also the centre of a growing telecomunications industry originating from the [[University of Aalborg|Aalborg University]].

[[Image:Aalborg NyTorv 2004 ubt.jpeg|thumb|300px|left|Nytorv, next to [[Limfjord]].]]

===Carnival in Aalborg===
The annual carnival takes place the last weekend in May.

During the carnival, Aalborg receives about 100,000 people. Friday “The Battle of Carnival Bands” is an exciting and colourful evening with processions through the city when all the participating groups compete to be the leading carnival group. 

The carnival itself is the following Saturday – on this day the city centre is full of life. The streets are filled with gaily dressed people who are in a real spring mood. In Kilde Park concerts are given from various stages all day to midnight. The Carnival ends with a grand firework display on the harbour.

===Architecture and tourist attractions===
The old castle [[Aalborghus Castle]] (''Aalborghus Slot'') and some picturesque houses of the [[17th century]] remain in the center of the town. The [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] (''bindingsværk'')  castle was built in 1550 by King [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]], and was converted to government administration offices in the 1950s.

[[Budolfi Church]] cathedral dates mostly from the middle of the [[18th century]], while ''Vor Frue Kirke'' (Church of Our Lady) was partially burnt in [[1894]].  The foundations of both churches are from the [[14th century]] or earlier.  

There are also an ancient hospital and a museum of art and antiquities.  

On the north side of the Limfjord is [[Nørresundby]], which is connected to Aalborg by a road bridge, an iron railway bridge, as well as a motorway tunnel running under the Limfjord.  Nørresundby is the site of the Lindholm Høje settlement and burial ground from the Germanic Iron Age and [[Viking]] times. There is also a museum on the site.

[[Aalborgtårnet]]. A tripod tower erected in 1933. The tower still gives an exquisite view over the
fjord and the city from its 105 m rise over the sea level. 

&lt;!--==Famous residents of the municipality==--&gt;
==Twinning==
Aalborg maintains cultural, economic and educational ties with some 25 cities around the globe, among others [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. Thus, Aalborg has the most twin cities in Denmark. Every five years Aalborg gathers youth from the majority of its twin cities for a week of sports games, known as Ungdomslegene (The Youth Games).

==Other information==
The city has a [[football (soccer)|football]] team playing in the Danish Superleague, [[Aalborg Boldspilklub]], which is known as AaB.

The city has the highest number of [[hairdresser]] shops, [[tattoo]] shops, bars, night clubs, pubs and [[solariums]] per inhabitant in [[Denmark]].

[[Image:Århus Rådhus.jpg|thumb|right|The [[City hall]] of Aarhus.]]
'''Aarhus''', also commonly known by its [[Danish language|Danish]] spelling '''Århus''', is the second largest city in [[Denmark]].  It is the principal [[port]] on the east coast of [[Jutland]]. Aarhus is also the location of the council of both [[Aarhus municipality]] and [[Aarhus County]].

==Demographics==
The city's population is 294,954 (July 2005) [http://www.aarhus.dk/statistik (1)].

The town lies at the junction of [[railway]] lines from all parts of the country in a low-lying, fertile, and well-wooded district.  To the southwest (13 miles by rail), a picturesque region that contains the [[Gudenaa|Gudenå]] and several lakes extends west from the railway junction of [[Skanderborg]], and rises to ground exceeding 500 feet in the [[Himmelbjerget]].  The railway traverses this pleasant district of moorland and woodland to [[Silkeborg]], a modern town with one of the most attractive situations in the kingdom.

The harbour is good and safe, and agricultural produce is exported, while [[coal]] and [[iron]] are among the chief imports.

The bishopric of Aarhus dates back at least from [[951]]. Aarhus' [[13th century]] [[cathedral]], The [[Århus Domkirke]], is the largest church in Denmark, as well as the second largest in [[Northern Europe]], being only 1.5&amp;nbsp;ft shorter than its counterpart in [[Trondheim]].

Aarhus is also home to one of the few [[ghetto]]s in Denmark: [[Gellerup]]

One major tourist attraction in Aarhus is [[The_Old_Town,_Aarhus|The Old Town]] ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Den Gamle By''), which is not actually an old part of the city itself, but a collection of old buildings from Danish history gathered from all around the country.

The [[Lord Mayor]] of Aarhus is [[Nicolai Wammen]] of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]].

Aarhus is the home of [[University of Aarhus]], [[Aarhus School of Business]] and the [[University College of Aarhus]].

==History==
&lt;!--Insert history intro here--&gt;
===The name===
In [[medieval]] times, the city was called ''Arus'', and in Icelandic chronicles, it was known as ''Áróss''. It is a compound of the two words ''ār'', genitive of ''ā'' &quot;river&quot; (Modern Danish ''å'') and ''ōss'' &quot;mouth&quot; (obsolete in Modern Danish; in Modern Icelandic this word is still used for &quot;river delta&quot;).  The city is located on the mouth of the small river Århus Å.

Through regular sound development, Medieval Danish ''Arus'' became ''Aars'' or ''Oes'', a form, which persisted in the dialects of the surrounding parishes until the 20th century. In 1406 ''Aarhus'' became revalent in the written sources, and gradually became the norm in the [[17th century]]. ''Aarhus'' is probably a remodelling after the numerous Low German place names in ''-husen'', possibly as a result of the influence of German merchants.

The city is mentioned the first time by [[Adam of Bremen]] who mentions that &quot;Reginbrand, bishop of the church of Aarhus (Harusam)&quot; participates in a church meeting in the city of [[Ingelham]] in [[Germany]]. {{fact}}

===Viking times===
The oldest [[Archaeology|archaelogical]] findings in Aarhus are glass pearls which date to the end of the [[7th century]]. Half buried [[Long houses]], used both as homes and workshops for the Vikings have also been found.{{fact}}

In the houses and the adjoining archaelogical layers, combs, jewelry and basic multi-purpose tools have been found that indicate the settlement is from approximately year [[900]]. Digs in the spring of 2005 revealed a so-called city-ditch from the year [[850]] which might have marked the trade centre upon which the city is built. {{fact}}

The finding of six [[rune stones]] in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around year [[1000]] as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them. {{fact}}

===1600-1700===
During the wars of the 17th century, it is probable that the city suffered a great deal. Fortifications still exist south of the city as a reminder of the [[Germany|German]] imperial campaigns between [[1627]] and [[1629]]. In [[1644]], [[Sweden]] taxed the city harshly and between [[1657]] and [[1659]], it was occupied by Swedish troops on several occasions. {{fact}}

In spite of these and other misfortunes, such as plague and city-wide fires, Aarhus was still quite a significant city in [[Denmark]] due to its favourable geographical position which was of significant importance for trading. Trade came mainly from the inland of [[Jutland]] but also from [[Norway]], [[Lübeck]], [[Amsterdam]], [[England]], [[France]] and [[Spain]]. In the middle of the 18th century the trade fleet consisted of approximately 100 ships.{{fact}}

===1800===
In the [[19th century]], the city gained more independence from the dominance of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Hamburg]]. While it had been the third largest city in Jutland during the early 19th century, its population surpassed [[Randers]] in [[1840]] and in [[1850]], [[Ålborg]], thus becoming the largest city in  Jutland and the second largest in Denmark.{{fact}}

The city's material prosperity continued to increase as the harbour expanded and the railway network grew. Culturally, it marketed itself as the &quot;Capital of Jutland&quot; and expanded many of its cultural institutions like the national library, universities, the [[Aarhus Theater]] and hospitals.

{{Wiktionarypar|abandonment}}

The term '''abandonment''' has a multitude of uses which can generally be broken into legal and extra-legal uses.  This &quot;signpost article&quot; provides a guide to the various uses of the word via links to articles that deal with each of the distinct concepts at length.

== Uses in law ==
'''Abandonment''' in law, the relinquishment of an interest, claim, privilege or possession.  This broad meaning has a number of applications in different branches of law.
*In [[Common law|common law]] jurisdictions, both ''common law abandonment'' and ''statutory abandonment'' of [[Property (ownership right)|property]] may be recognized. A common law abandonment may be generally defined as &quot;the relinquishment of a right [in property] by the owner thereof without any regard to future possession by himself or any other person, and with the intention to foresake or desert the right....&quot; 1 ''Corpus Juris Secundum'' “Abandonment” § 2 (1985) (emphasis added) [footnotes and citations omitted]. Common law abandonment is &quot;the voluntary relinquishment of a thing by its owner with the intention of terminating his ownership, and without [the intention of] vesting ownership in any other person; the giving up of a thing absolutely, without reference to any particular person or purpose....&quot; Id. (emphasis added) [footnotes and citations omitted]. An example of statutory abandonment in a common law jurisdiction is abandonment by a [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy trustee]] under {{usc|11|554}}).
*Abandonment of an action (see [[Judicature Acts#Specific changes in procedure|Judicature Acts]]), relates to a plaintiff's discontinuance of proceedings ongoing before the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]] and which procedure changed substantially as a result of reforms to the judiciary of the United Kingdom in 1875.
*In [[marine insurance]] parlance, abandonment involves the surrender of a ship or goods to the insurer.
*In the domain of [[copyright]]s, abandonment is recognized as the explicit release of material by a copyright holder into the [[public domain]].  However, statutory abandonment is a relatively unclear area of copyright law and the more common approach is to license work under a scheme that provides for public use rather than strictly abandoning copyright.  For more information consult [[Public_domain#Disclaimer of interest|&quot;disclaimer of interest&quot;]].
*In the military practice and law, abandonment of a military post by a soldier can be called [[desertion]], and the condition of being away from that post can be called [[Desertion#AWOL: Away WithOut Leave|being &quot;Away Without Leave&quot;]].
*In family circumstances, [[child abandonment]] is often recognized as a crime, in which case the child is usually not physically harmed directly as part of the abandonment; distinct from this is the widely recognized crime of [[infanticide]].
&lt;!--  '''Abandonment of wife and children''' is sometimes called ''[[desertion]],'' and is somewhat difficult to prove in court.  The plaintiff must generally show his or spouse to have left for over a year and failed to pay support, as well as proving that the departure was not agreed upon and also not caused by the plaintiff.  Because abandonment by a husband often left his wife and children destitute (and hence a burden upon the public purse), it used to be a [[felony]] in most [[U.S. state|American states]].  At present, nearly all states have abolished the felony of abandonment, but it remains in place in a few states like [[Massachusetts]].  The abandonment or exposure of a young child under the age of two, which is an indictable [[misdemeanor]], is commonly called ''cruelty to children.''   --&gt;
* '''Abandonment of domicile''' is the ceasing to reside permanently in a former domicile coupled with the intention of choosing a new domicile.  The presumptions which will guide the court in deciding whether a former domicile has been abandoned or not must be inferred from the facts of each individual case.  In the United States, a tenant is generally understood to have abandoned a property if he or she has fallen behind in rent and shown a lack of interest in continuing to live there.  The landlord must then send notice of the intent to sell the property and wait a certain number of days to take action on it.  How long the landlord has to wait depends on the value of the property; the landlord can keep the money up to the costs incurred as a result of the abandonment; the rest must be set aside for the former tenant, should she or he eventually return.

* '''Abandonment of an easement''' is the relinquishment of some accommodation or right in another's land, such as right of way, free access of light and air, etc. See [[easement]].

* '''''Abandonment of railways''''' has a legal signification in England recognized by statute, by authority of which the [[Board of Trade]] may, under certain circumstances, grant a warrant to a [[railway]] authorizing the abandonment of its line or part of it.

* '''Abandonment of trademark''' is understood to happen when a [[trademark]] is not used for three or more years, or when it is deliberately discontinued; trademark law protects only trademarks being actively used and defended.

== Extra-legal uses ==
Outside of legal circles, '''abandonment''' has additional meanings and uses:
* '''''Abandonment''''' is a play about love, death, identity and evolution. It is a complex mixture of social comedy and family drama, reminding us that the past is not as far away as we think. Written by [[Kate Atkinson]].
* '''[[Child abandonment]] in film and literature''':
** ''[[Bachelor Mother]]'' ([[Garson Kanin]]; US, 1939)
* '''Abandonment of a patient''', in [[medicine]], is where a health care professional (usually a [[physician]], [[nurse]], [[dentist]], or [[paramedic]]) has already begun emergency treatment of a patient and then suddenly walks away while the patient is still in need, without securing the services of an adequate substitute, or giving the patient adequate opportunity to find one.  It is a [[crime]] in many countries and can result in the loss of one's license to practice.  Also, because of the [[public policy]] in favor of keeping people alive, the professional cannot defend himself or herself by pointing to the patient's inability to pay for services, the possibility of exposure to malpractice liability beyond one's insurance coverage, or the patient's inability to stop screaming (because of extreme pain).

The word '''abatement''' has various meanings, many of them legal. The word came through French ''abattre'' from Latin ''ab'' + Late Latin ''battuere'' = &quot;to beat&quot; (which came from Germanic). It means a beating down or reducing or doing away with something.

*[[Abatement of a nuisance]], the remedy allowed by law to a person or public authority injured by a public [[nuisance]], letting him destroy or remove it, if doing so causes no breach of the peace. In the case of private nuisances, abatement is also allowed if it causes no breach of the peace and no damage beyond what removing the nuisance requires.

*Abatement of [[freehold (real property)|freehold]] happens where, after the person last seised dies, a stranger enters upon lands before the entry of the heir or devisee, and keeps the heir or devisee out of possession. 
**[[Intrusion]], an entry by a stranger when a tenant for life dies, to the prejudice of the reversioner or remainder man.
**[[Disseisin]], the forcible or fraudulent expulsion of a person seised of the freehold.

*[[Abatement of debts and legacies]], a common law doctrine of wills that holds that when the equitable assets of a deceased person are not sufficient to satisfy fully all the creditors, their debts must abate proportionately

*[[Abatement in pleading]], or plea in abatement, was a [[plea]] by the defendant, defeating or quashing a legal action by some matter of fact, such as a defect in form or the personal incompetency of the parties suing. It did not involve the merits of the cause, but left the right of action subsisting. In criminal proceedings, a [[plea]] in abatement was at one time a common practice in answer to an indictment, and was set up to defeat the indictment as framed, by alleging that the defendant was wrongly named (&quot;misnomer&quot;) or was otherwise wrongly described. Its effect for this purpose was nullified by the Criminal Law Act 1826, which required the court to amend according to the truth, and the Criminal Procedure Act 1851 (see [[Criminal Procedure]]), which rendered description of the defendant unnecessary. All pleas in abatement are now abolished (R.S.G. Order 21, r. 20).

*[[Abatement in litigation]], in civil proceedings, no action abates because any of the parties marries or dies or becomes [[bankrupt]], if the cause of the action survives or continues, and does not become defective because any [[estate]] or [[title]] is assigned or created or [[devolution|devolved]] ''[[pendente lite]]'' (R.S.C. Order 17, r. 1). [[Criminal proceeding]]s do not abate on the death of the prosecutor, being in theory instituted by the crown; but the crown may terminate them without deciding on the merits and without the assent of the prosecutor. 

*Abatement of false lights, by the Merchant Shipping Act 1854, the general lighthouse authority has power to order the extinguishment or screening of any light which may be mistaken for a light proceeding from a lighthouse. 

*Abatement in commerce is a deduction sometimes made at a [[custom-house]] from the fixed duties on certain kinds of goods, on account of damage or loss sustained in [[warehouse]]s. The rate and conditions of such deductions are regulated, in England, by the Customs Consolidation Act 1853. (See also drawback and [[rebate (marketing)]].) 

*[[Abatement (heraldry)]] is a badge in coat-armour, indicating some kind of [[degradation]] or dishonour. It is also called rebatement. Though most abatements have existed only in theory, there has been at least one imposition of an abatement in Scotland.
