==Notes==
*{{fnb|1}} Monica would have called herself a Catholic. However the word Catholic is not being used in the modern sense of Catholic versus Orthodox. Rather in the older sense of a follower of the [[Nicene Creed]], in that she was not a [[Donatist]] or [[Arian]], a significant distinction for the time.

*[[Christian rock]] band [[Petra (band)|Petra]] dedicated a song to St. Augustine called ''&quot;St. Augustine Pears&quot;''. It's based on one of Augustine's writings in his book &quot;Confessions&quot; where he tells of how he stole some neighbor's pears without being hungry, and how that petty theft haunted him through his life.[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rels/002/lectures/lecture18.html]

*[[Jon Foreman]], lead singer and song writer of the [[Christian rock]] band [[Switchfoot]] wrote a song called &quot;Something More (Augustine's Confession),&quot; based after the life and book, &quot;Confessions&quot;, of Augustine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For legal meaning of '''acting''', see [[Acting (law)]].''
:''For the military sense, see [[Acting (rank)]].''

'''Acting''' is the work of an '''[[actor]]''', a person in [[theatre]], [[film]], or any other storytelling medium who tells the story by portraying a character and, usually, speaking or singing the written text or [[play]]. From the [[Latin]] word ''ag&amp;#x0115;re'' meaning &quot;to do&quot;, this is precisely what acting is.  In acting, an actor suppresses or augments aspects of their personality in order to reveal the actions and motivations of the [[fictional character|character]] for particular moments in time.  The [[actor]] is said to be &quot;assuming the [[role]]&quot; of another, usually for the benefit of an [[audience]], but also because it can bring one a sense of artistic satisfaction.

Actors are generally expected to possess a number of skills, including good vocal projection, clarity of speech, physical expressiveness, the ability to analyze and understand dramatic text, and the ability to emulate or generate emotional and physical conditions. Well-rounded actors are often also skilled in [[singing]], [[dancing]], imitating [[dialect]]s and [[Accent (language)|accent]]s, [[improvisational theatre|improvisation]], observation and emulation, [[mime]], [[stage combat]], and performing classical texts such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. Many actors train at length in special programs or colleges to develop these skills, which have a wide range of different artistic philosophies and processes.  

Modern pioneers in the area of acting have included [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Uta Hagen]], [[Stella Adler]], Eric Morris, [[Michael Chekhov]], [[Viola Spolin]] and [[Sanford Meisner]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aerospace engineering''' is the branch of [[engineering]] that concerns [[aircraft]], [[spacecraft]] and related topics.  It is often called aeronautical engineering, particularly when referring solely to aircraft, and astronautical engineering, when referring to spacecraft.

Some of the elements of aerospace engineering are:
* [[Aerodynamics]] - the study of [[fluid]] flow around objects such as [[wing]]s or through objects such as [[wind tunnel]]s (see also [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[aeronautics]])
* Propulsion - the energy to move a vehicle through the air (or in outer space) is provided by [[internal combustion engine]]s, [[jet engine]]s, or [[rocket]]s (see also [[propeller]] and [[Spacecraft Propulsion]])
* [[Control engineering]] - the study of mathematical modelling of systems and designing them in order that they behave in the desired way
* Structures - design of the physical configuration of the craft to withstand the forces encountered during flight. Aerospace engineering aims very much at keeping structures lightweight.
* [[Materials science]] - related to structures, aerospace engineering also studies the materials of which the aerospace structures are to be built. New materials with very specific properties are invented, or existing ones are modified to improve their performance.
* [[Aeroelasticity]] - the interaction of aerodynamic forces and structural flexibility, potentially causing flutter, divergence, etc
* [[Computer science]] - specifically concerning the design and programming of any computer systems on board an aircraft or spacecraft and the simulation of systems.

The basis of most of these elements lies in theoretical [[mathematics]], such as [[fluid dynamics]] for aerodynamics or the [[equations of motion]] for [[flight dynamics]].  However, there is also a large [[empiricism|empirical]] component.  Historically, this empirical component was derived from testing of scale models and prototypes, either in wind tunnels or in the free atmosphere.  More recently, advances in [[computing]] have enabled the use of [[computational fluid dynamics]] to simulate the behavior of fluid, reducing time and expense spent on wind-tunnel testing.

Additionally, aerospace engineering addresses the integration of all components that constitute an aerospace vehicle (subsystems including power, communications, thermal control, life support, etc.) and its life cycle (design, temperature, pressure, radiation, velocity, life time), leading to extraordinary challenges and solutions specific to the domain of aerospace systems engineering.

See [[List of aerospace engineering topics]].


==Popular culture==
Popular culture has not been unaffected by this branch of engineering. The term &quot;rocket scientist&quot; is at times used to describe a person of remarkable or in the considered context higher than average inteligence. Aerospace engineering has also been represented as the more &quot;glittery&quot; pinnacle of engineering. The movie [[Apollo 13]] depicts the ground team as group of heros in a Hollywood fashion glorifying the inteligence and competence of ''white shirt and tie'' proffesionals as a sharp contrast to pop culture trends. This was later extended in more detail in the spin-off series [[From the Earth to the Moon]].

==Aerospace engineering degrees==
Aerospace (or aeronautical) engineering can be studied at the [[bachelor's degree|bachelors]], [[master's degree|masters]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] levels in aerospace engineering departments at many universities, and in mechanical engineering departments at others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Athenian_empire_450.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Delian League (Athenian Empire), at its height in 450 B.C.]]

The '''Delian League''' was an association of [[Greece|Greek]] [[city-state]]s in the [[5th century BC]].  It was led by [[Athens]].  Because many of the league's [[Polis]]' were too poor to contribute ships to the collective navy, they paid taxes to Athens so that there would be enough money to build the expensive [[trireme]]s.

In [[478 BC]], following the defeat of [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]]' invasion of Greece, [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]] the [[Sparta]]n led Hellenic forces against the [[Iran|Persia]]ns.  He was an unpopular commander (who may have conspired with the Persians), and Sparta was eager to stop prosecuting the war.  They surrendered the leadership of the ongoing campaign to [[Athens]], which was eager to accept it.  The Delian League was inaugurated in [[477 BC]] as an offensive and defensive alliance against Persia.  The principal cities in the League were [[Athens]], [[Chios]], [[Samos Island|Samos]], and [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], but many of the principal islands and [[Ionia]]n cities joined the league.

[[Athens]] led the Delian League from the beginning, though at its founding the [[treasury]] was located on the island of [[Delos]], and each state in the league had an equal vote.  The assessment due from each state was assigned by [[Aristides the Just]], leader of the Athenians; some members were assessed ships, others troops, others weapons, and others money.  A council of all the cities met at Delos regularly, probably when bringing their assessment to the island.

The first action of the Delian League, under the command of [[Cimon]], was the capture of [[Eion]], a Persian fortification that guarded a river crossing on the way to [[Asia]]; following this victory, the League acted against several [[pirate]] islands in the [[Aegean Sea]], most notably against [[Scyros]] where they turned the [[Dolopian]] inhabitants into slaves, and [[Athens]] set up a settler-colony (known as a [[cleruchy]]).  A few years later they sailed against [[Caria]] and [[Lycia]], defeating both the Persian army and navy in the [[battle of the Eurymedon]].

These actions were most likely very popular with the League's members.  However, the League, particularly the [[Athenians]], were willing to force cities to join or stay in the League.  [[Carystus]], a city on the southern tip of [[Euboea]], was forced to join the League by military actions of the Athenians.  The justification for this was that Carystus was enjoying the advantages of the League (protection from pirates and the Persians) without taking on any of the responsibilities.  Furthermore, Carystus was a traditional base for Persian occupations.  Athenian politicians had to justify these acts to Athenian voters in order to get votes.  [[Naxos, Greece|Naxos]], a member of the Delian League, attempted to secede, and was enslaved; Naxos is believed to have been forced to tear down her walls, lost her fleet, and her vote in the League.

[[Thucydides]] tells us that this is how Athens' control over the League grew.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Of all the causes of defection, that connected with arrears of tribute and vessels, and with failure of service, was the chief; for the Athenians were very severe and exacting, and made themselves offensive by applying the screw of necessity to men who were not used to and in fact not disposed for any continuous labor.  In some other respects the Athenians were not the old popular rulers they had been at first; and if they had more than their fair share of service, it was correspondingly easy for them to reduce any that tried to leave the confederacy.  The Athenians also arranged for the other members of the league to pay its share of the expense in money instead of in ships and men, and for this the subject city-states had themselves to blame, their wish to get out of giving service making most leave their homes.  Thus while Athens was increasing her navy with the funds they contributed, a revolt always found itself without enough resources or experienced leaders for war.  [Thucydides i. 99]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[454 BC]], Athens moved the treasury of the Delian League from Delos to Athens, allegedly to keep it safe from Persia.  However, [[Plutarch]] indicates that many of [[Pericles]]' rivals viewed the transfer as Athens usurping monetary resources to fund elaborate building projects.     They also switched from accepting ships, men and weapons, to only accepting money.  The new treasury established in Athens was used for many purposes, not all relating to the defense of members of the league.  It was from tribute paid to the league that Athenians built the [[Acropolis]] and the [[Parthenon]], as well as many other non-defense related expenditures.  It was during this time that some claim that the [[Athenian Empire]] arose, as the technical definition of ''empire'' is a group of cities paying taxes to a central, dominant city, while keeping local governments intact.  This is what was happening in the Delian League.  It was turning from an alliance to an empire.

In [[461 BC]], Cimon was [[ostracism|ostracized]], and was succeeded in his influence by democrats like [[Ephialtes]] and [[Pericles]].  This signaled a complete change in Athenian foreign policy, neglecting the alliance with the [[Sparta]]ns and instead allying with her enemies, [[Argos]] and [[Thessaly]].  [[Megara]] deserted the Peloponnesian league and allied herself with Athens, allowing construction of a double line of walls across the isthmus of [[Corinth]], protecting Athens from attack from that quarter.  Around the same time they also constructed the [[Long Walls]] connecting their city to the [[Piraeus]], its port, making it effectively invulnerable to attack by land.

Soon war with the Peloponnesians broke out.  In [[458 BC]], the Athenians blockaded the island of [[Aegina]], and simultaneously defended Megara from the Corinthians by sending out an army composed of those too young or old for regular military service.  The next year [[Sparta]] sent an army into [[Boeotia]], reviving the power of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] to help hold the Athenians in check.  Their return was blocked, and they resolved to march on Athens, where the Long Walls were not yet completed, winning a victory at the [[Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)|Battle of Tanagra]].  All this accomplished, however, was to allow them to return home via the Megarid.  Two months later, the Athenians under [[Myronides]] invaded [[Boeotia]], and winning the [[battle of Oenophyta]] gained control of the whole country except Thebes.

War with the Persians continued, however.  In [[460 BC]], [[Egypt]] had revolted under [[Inarus]] and [[Amyrtaeus]], who requested aid from Athens.  [[Pericles]] led 200 ships, originally intended to attack [[Cyprus]], to their aid because it would hurt Persia.  Persia's image had already been hurt when it failed to conquer the [[Greeks]] and [[Pericles]] wanted to further this.  After four years, however, the rebellion was defeated by the general [[Megabyzus]], who captured the greater part of the Athenian forces.  The remainder escaped to [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] and thence returned home.

This was Athenians' main (public) reason for moving the treasury of the League from Delos to Athens, further consolidating their control over the League.  The Persians followed up their victory by sending a fleet to re-establish their control over [[Cyprus]], and 200 ships were sent out to counter them under [[Cimon]], who returned from ostracism in [[451 BC]].  He died during the blockade of [[Citium]], though the fleet won a double victory by land and sea over the Persians off [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]].

This battle was the last major one fought against the Persians. Many writers report that a formal peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Callias]], was formalized in [[450 BC]], but some writers believe that the treaty was a myth created later to inflate the stature of Athens.  However, an understanding was definitely reached, enabling the Athenians to focus their attention on events in Greece proper.

The peace with Persia, however, was followed by further reverses.  The [[battle of Coronea (447 BC)|Battle of Coronea]], in [[447 BC]], led to the abandonment of Boeotia.  [[Euboea]] and [[Megara]] both revolted, and while the former was restored to its status as a tributary ally, the latter was a permanent loss.  The Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues signed a peace treaty, which was set to endure for thirty years.  It only lasted until [[431 BC]], when the [[Peloponnesian War]] broke out.

Those who revolted unsuccessfully during the war saw the example made of the [[Mytilene|Mytilenians]], the principal people on Lesbos.  After an unsuccessful revolt, the Athenians ordered the death of the entire male population.  After some thought, they rescinded this order, and only put to death the leading 1000 ringleaders of the revolt, and redistributed the land of the entire island to Athenian shareholders, who were sent out to reside on Lesbos.

This type of treatment was not reserved solely for those who revolted.  [[Thucydides]] documents the example of [[Melos]], a small island, neutral in the war, though originally founded by Spartans.  The Melians were offered a choice to join the Athenians, or be conquered.  Choosing to resist, their town was besieged and conquered; the males were put to death, and the women sold into slavery (see [[Melian dialogue]]).

The Delian League was never formally turned into the Athenian Empire; but by the start of the [[Peloponnesian War]], only [[Chios]] and Lesbos were left to contribute ships, and these states were by now far too weak to secede without support.  Lesbos tried to revolt first, and failed completely.  Chios, the greatest and most powerful of the original members of the Delian League (save Athens), was the last to revolt, and in the aftermath of the [[Syracusan Expedition]] enjoyed a success of several years, inspiring all of Ionia to revolt.  Athens was, however, still able to eventually suppress these revolts.

The Athenian Empire was very stable, and only 27 years of war, aided by the Persians and internal strife, were able to defeat it.  The Athenian Empire did not stay defeated for long.  The [[Second Athenian Empire]], a maritime self-defense league, was founded in [[377 BC]] and was led by Athens; but Athens would never recover the full extent of her power, and her enemies were now far stronger and more varied.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''August Horch''' ([[October 12]], [[1868]] - [[February 3]], [[1951]]) was a German engineer and automobile pioneer, he founded the manufacturing firm that would become [[Audi]]. 

[[Image:Gedenktafel horch ehrenfeld.jpg|thumb|Memorial plate in [[Cologne, Germany]].]]

He was born in [[Winningen]], [[Moselle]]. He was educated in Mittweida.

He worked for [[Karl Benz]] from [[1896]] before founding ''A. [[Horch]] &amp; Cie'' in November [[1899]] in Ehrenfeld, [[Cologne, Germany]]. The first Horch automobile was built in 1901. The company moved to Reichenbach in [[1902]] and [[Zwickau]] in [[1904]]. Horch left the company in 1909 after a dispute and set up in competition in Zwickau. His new firm was initially called ''Horch Automobil-Werke GmbH'', but following a legal dispute over the ''Horch'' name he was oblidged to change the company name. (The court decided that ''Horch'' was a registered trademark on behalf of August Horch's former partners and August Horch was not entitled to use it any more.) Consequently, Horch renamed his company to ''Audi Automobilwerke GmbH'' in [[1910]], ''Audi'' being the Latinization of Horch. 

In August [[1928]] the [[Denmark|Danish]] engineer [[Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen]] of [[DKW]] acquired a majority holding in Audiwerke. In June [[1932]] Audi, DKW, Horch and [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]] merged to form [[Auto Union]] AG, the new company's logo was four interlinked rings, one for each of the founder companies. [[Horch]] was on the supervisory board of Auto Union.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The onboard electronics used for piloting an [[aircraft]] are called '''avionics''' (AVI-ation electr-ONICS). Avionics include communications and navigation systems, [[autopilot]]s, and electronic [[flight management system]]s (FMS).  Onboard electronics that are unrelated to piloting tasks, such as video systems for passengers, are sometimes considered avionics as well.  Many of these devices include [[embedded system|embedded computers]]. The term is also used to define the electronics units fitted to a [[spacecraft]].

== History ==

[[Radiotelephone]] ([[two-way radio|two way voice radio]]) systems have been installed in aircraft since before [[World War II]], and have been widely used for mission coordination and [[air traffic control]].  Early systems used [[vacuum tube]]s, and because of their weight and size, were installed out of the way with only a control head in place in the flight deck.  Standardization on [[Very high frequency|VHF]] frequences occurred shortly after [[World War II]], and [[transistor radio]] systems replaced the tube-based systems shortly afterward.  Only minor changes have been made to these systems since the [[1960s]].

The earliest navigation systems required the [[Aviator|pilot]] or [[navigator]] to wear [[headphones]] and listen to the relative volume of tones in each ear to determine which way to steer on course.

Later, navigation systems developed along five separate paths:
* [[Non-directional beacon|NDB/ADF]] systems
* [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] systems
* [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] systems
* [[ATCRBS]] Transponders
* [[Distance Measuring Equipment]]
* [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers

==== Non-Directional Radiobeacon ====

The [[Non-directional beacon|NDB]] (non-directional radiobeacon) was the first electronic navigation system in widespread use.  The original radio range stations were high-power NDBs, and followed nighttime routes previously delineated by colored light beacons.  DF (direction finder) and [[Automatic Direction Finder|ADF]] (Automatic Direction Finder) avionics can receive signals from these.  A needle shows the pilot the relative [[heading]] toward the station compared to the centerline of the aircraft.  NDBs use the [[Low Frequency|LF]] and [[Medium frequency|MF]] bands, and are still in use today (2005) at smaller airports because of their low cost but their use is quickly being supplanted by GPS.  This is due mostly from the higher cost of ADF equipment in the aircraft and maintaining the NDB stations.

==== VHF Omni Range ====

The [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] system ([[Very high frequency|VHF]] omni range) is less prone to [[interference (communication)|interference]] from [[thunderstorm]]s, and provides improved accuracy.  It is still the backbone of the air navigational system today.  VOR receivers allow the pilot to specify a ''[[radial]]'', that is, a line extending outward from the VOR transmitter at a particular angle from magnetic north.  Then, a [[course deviation indicator]] (CDI) shows the amount by which the aircraft is off the chosen course.  [[Distance measuring equipment]] (DME) was added to many VOR transmitters and receivers, allowing the distance between the station and the aircraft to be shown .

==== Instrument Landing System ====

The [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) is a set of components used to navigate to the landing end of a runway.  It consists of lateral guidance from a ''[[localizer]]'', vertical guidance from a ''[[glideslope]]'', and distance guidance from a series of ''marker beacons.''  Optional components include [[Distance measuring equipment|DME]] and a ''compass locator,'' the name given to an NDB placed at the start of the final approach course.

==== Transponder ====

The [[transponder]] is a transceiver that receives &quot;interrogations&quot; from [[air traffic control]] [[radar]] systems and replies with a digital code. This [[radar|secondary radar]] reply permits the radar system to detect the [[aircraft]] more reliably and at greater distances than are possible with [[primary radar]]. This system of secondary radars and transponders is known collectively as the [[air traffic control radar beacon system]], or ATCRBS.

A basic &quot;mode A&quot; transponder responds with a 4-digit code with each digit ranging from 0 to 7. This is called a 4,096 code transponder. This pilot sets the code according to the type and status of the flight or as directed by [[air traffic control]].

A &quot;mode C&quot; transponder also replies with the [[pressure altitude]] of the aircraft encoded to the nearest 100 feet (30 m). Modern &quot;mode S&quot; transponders can respond with a longer digital identifier that is unique for each aircraft (thus allowing each aircraft to be uniquely identified even when there is no voice communication between the aircraft and air traffic control) and can receive digital traffic information from [[air traffic control]] [[radar]] systems and display them for the pilot.

An IFF transponder, &quot;[[Identification friend or foe]]&quot;, is used in [[military aircraft]] and has additional modes of operation beyond those used in civil air traffic control.

==== DME ====

[[Distance Measurement Equipment]] (DME) is used to inform the pilot of his/her aircraft's distance away from the [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] station, thus with a [[bearing]] and distance from a particular known VOR station a pilot can [[fix (position)|fix]] his exact position. Such systems are refered to as VOR/DME. DME is also part of a military navigation system widely used in the US, the [[TACAN]] (TACtical Air Navigation). A ground station combining VOR and TACAN is known as VOR-TAC. The frequencies for the VOR and DME or VOR and TACAN are paired by international standards. Once a pilot tunes onto a particular VOR frequency, the airborne equipment will automatically tunes on the co-located DME or Tacan.

==== LORAN ====

For a time, [[LORAN]] systems, which provide navigational guidance over large areas, were popular particularly for general aviation use.  They have declined in popularity with the commercial availability of GPS service in small planes, and INS, widely used in large airliners.

===Auxiliary and diagnostic systems===

[[civil aviation|Commercial aircraft]] are expensive, and only make money when they are flying.  For this reason, efficient operators perform as much service as possible in-flight, and during the turn-around time in a terminal.  To make this process possible, [[embedded computer]] systems test aircraft systems, and also collect information about faults in equipment that they control.  This information is normally collected in an on-board maintenance computer, and sometimes transmitted ahead to help order spares.  Although this sounds ideal, in real life, these self-test systems are often not considered flight-critical, and therefore they are sometimes unreliable, and trusted only to indicate that a device requires service.

==Recent advances==

Avionics have changed significantly with the advent of the GPS receiver and &quot;[[glass cockpit]]&quot; display systems.  

===Global Positioning System (GPS)===

The use of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) has changed aircraft navigation both in the en-route phase and approach (landing) phases of flight.

Aircraft have traditionally flown from one radio navigation aid (&quot;navaids&quot;) to the next (e.g., from [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] to VOR).  The paths between navaids are called [[airways]].  While this is rarely the shortest route between any two [[airport]]s, the use of airways was necessary because it was the only way for aircraft to navigate with precision in instrument conditions.  The use of GPS has changed this, by allowing &quot;direct&quot; routing, allowing aircraft to navigate from point to point without the need for ground-based navigation.  This has the potential to save significant amounts of both time and [[jet fuel|fuel]] while en-route.

However, &quot;direct-to&quot; routing causes non-trivial difficulties for the [[air traffic control]] (ATC) system.  ATC's basic purpose is to maintaining appropriate vertical and horizontal separation between aircraft.  The use of direct routing makes maintaining separation harder.  A good analogy would be vehicular traffic:  Roads are comparable to airways.  If there were no roads and drivers simply went directly to their destination, significant chaos would ensue (e.g., large parking lots without barriers or lines).  ATC does give clearance for direct routing on occasion, but its use is limited.  Projects like [[Free flight (air traffic control)|free flight]] propose to computerize ATC and allow greater use of direct routing by identifing potential conflicts and suggesting maneuvers to maintain separation.  This is much like the existing [[Traffic Collision Avoidance System]], but on a larger scale and would look further forward in time.

GPS has also significantly changed the approach phase of flight.  When horizontal visibility and vertical cloud ceilings are below [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) minimums, 
aircraft must operate under [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR).  Under IFR, aircraft must use navigational equipment for horizontal and vertical [[guidance system|guidance]].  This is particularly important in the [[approach control|approach]] and landing phases of flight.  The path and procedure used to land on a particular [[runway]] is called an [[instrument approach]].

IFR approaches traditionally required the use of ground-based navaids such as VOR, NDB and ILS.  GPS offers some significant advantages over traditional systems in that no ground-based equipment is required, reducing cost.  This has allowed many smaller airports that cannot justify ILS equipment to now have instrument approaches.  GPS receivers for aircraft are also less expensive, use a single small antenna, and require virtually no calibration.

The downside to GPS approaches is that they have higher minimum visibility and ceiling requirements.  ILS typically require a cloud ceiling no lower than 200 feet above ground level and horizontal visibility greater than 1/4 mile, while GPS minimums are typically never less than 400 feet and 1 mile.  This difference in minimums is because GPS approaches offer horizontal guidance only.  Vertical guidance is possible, but GPS accuracy in the vertical is not as high as in the horizontal.  To solve this problem, the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] has implemented the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS).  GPS receivers with WAAS capability have typical vertical accuracy of 2-3 meters.  This is sufficient for ILS-type approaches, i.e., those with vertical navigation.  GPS/WAAS receivers certified for vertical navigation GPS approaches are slowly coming to the market.

Although the FAA was initially slow to allow the use of GPS in IFR approaches, the number of published GPS approaches is climbing significantly.  However, because ILS has lower minimum visibility and ceiling requirements, ILS remains the &quot;best&quot; type of approach, and the FAA has committed to maintaining ILS installations.

===Glass cockpits===
{{main|Glass cockpit}}
Advances in computing power and flat panel [[LCD]] displays have made the [[glass cockpit]] possible.  Glass cockpits are loosely defined as aircraft flight decks where information is presented on one or more electronic displays.  They offer significantly lower pilot workloads and improved [[situational awareness]] over traditional &quot;steam gauge&quot; flight decks.

Glass cockpits were first introduced on airliners and military aircraft.  Recently, they have started to appear in [[general aviation]] aircraft such as the [[Cirrus Design]] [[Cirrus SR20|SR20]] and [[Lancair]] designs.

{{Greek myth (Olympian)}}
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Ares''' (&quot;battle strife&quot;; in Greek, &amp;#x1F08;&amp;rho;&amp;eta;&amp;sigmaf;), is the [[god]] of [[war]] and son of Zeus and Hera. Before sacred battles people worshipped him.  The Romans [[interpretatio Romana|identified]] [[Mars (god)|Mars]], the god of war (whom they had inherited from the [[Etruscans]]) with Hellenic Ares, but among them, Mars stood in much higher esteem. Among the Hellenes, Ares was always mistrusted: His birthplace and true home was placed far off, among the barbarous and warlike [[Thracia]]ns (''Iliad'' xiii.301; ''Odyssey'' viii.361; Ovid). 

Although important in poetry, Ares was only rarely the recipient of [[Cult (religion)|cult worship]], save at [[Sparta]] and in the founding myth of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and he appeared in few myths (Burkert 1985, p.169). The temple to Ares in the agora of [[Athens]] that [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] saw in the 2nd century AD had only been moved and rededicated there during the time of [[Augustus]]; in essence it was a Roman temple to Mars. The [[Areopagus]], the &quot;hill of Ares&quot; where [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] preached, is sited at some distance from the Acropolis; from archaic times it was a site of trials. Its connection with Ares, perhaps based on a false etymology, may be purely [[etiological]].

The single major role of Ares sited in mainland Greece itself was in the founding myth of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]: Ares was the progenitor of the water-dragon slain by [[Cadmus]] (Kádmos). From the dragon's teeth (sown as if a crop) arose a race of fighting men, the descendents of Ares. To propitiate Ares, Cadmus took as a bride [[Harmonia (Greek_goddess)|Harmonía]], daughter of Ares' union with Aphrodite, thus harmonizing all strife and founding the city of Thebes. 
[[Image:Ares villa Hadriana.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Statue of Ares, villa Hadriana]]

Among the so-called &quot;[[Homeric hymn]]s&quot;, a &quot;Hymn to Ares&quot; has been transmitted in the manuscripts, although modern scholarship has detected that it was written in [[Late Antiquity]] (Burkert p 415, note 15). Even so, apart from sacrifices to him made by commanders of armies in the field, Ares was venerated most often in conjunction with other gods; for example, he shared a temple with [[Aphrodite]] at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. Besides Aphrodite, the adjective ''areios, areia'' is applied to other gods in their warlike aspect.  In the ''[[Iliad]]'' &quot;Ares&quot; is as often embodied in a battle formula connoting rough strife as he is personified as a bronze-armoured god: he is repeatedly contrasted with [[Athena]], to his disadvantage. To Athena is reserved the one glorious aspect of war, ''[[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]'', &quot;[[victory]]&quot;. (Burkert p 169). At Athens, the ''[[Areopagus|Areios pagus]]'' near the Acropolis, is equally the &quot;Hill of Ares&quot; and simply the &quot;Battle Hill&quot;.

For Mars, ''Enyalios'' was sometimes used as an epithet: see [[Ares Enyalius]].  Interestingly, the [[Mycenean Greek]] [[Linear B]] tablets list a god [[Enyalios]], while ''ares'' seems already to be a common noun meaning &quot;war.&quot;  By classical times, however, ''Enyalios'' had been demoted to the status of hero (as in the ''[[Iliad]]'') and Ares the name for the god.  ''Enyalios'' survived as a cult-title in only a few settings, most notably in the oath of the [[ephebe]]s at [[Athens]].

In one archaic [[mytheme]], related by the ancient earth-goddess [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]] to her daughter [[Aphrodite]], two chthonic giants, the brothers [[Aloadae|Otus]] and [[Ephialtes]], threw Ares into chains and put him in a bronze urn, where he had to endure for thirteen months, a [[lunar year]]. &quot;And that would have been the end of Ares and his appetite for war, if the beautiful [[Eriboea]], the young giants' stepmother, had not told [[Hermes]] what they had done,&quot; she related (''Illiad'', v. 385&amp;ndash;91). &quot;In this one suspects a festival of licence which is unleashed in the thirteenth month,&quot; Burkert observes (p 169).

There are accounts of a son of Ares, [[Cycnus]] (''Kýknos'') of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], who was so murderous that he attempted to build a temple with the skulls and the bones of travellers. [[Heracles]] slaughtered this abominable monstrosity, engendering the wrath of Ares, whom the hero wounded ([[Apollodorus]] 2.114). 

Ares gave [[Hippolyte]] the girdle that [[Heracles]] took.

In an episode sung in the hall of [[Alcinous]] (Alkínoös), king of the [[Phaeacians]] (''Odyssey'' viii.302ff), Ares lay in bed with [[Aphrodite]], wife of [[Hephaestus]], and [[Helios]] the Sun spied the love-making couple, alerting Hephaestus, who was angered. Hephaestus rigged the bed with invisibly fine net of chain with the power to hold anything in place, including gods, and caught Ares and Aphrodite on the next occasion. He brought the other gods to witness the adultery&amp;mdash;the goddesses stayed away out of modesty&amp;mdash;thinking to humiliate Ares and Aphrodite, but the gods all laughed. Poseidon agreed to refund to cuckolded Hephaestus the bride-price of Aphrodite. Once the couple were loosed, Ares sped away to his homeland, Thrace. (In a much later interpolated detail, Ares put a youth Alectryon by his door to guard them, but Alectryon fell asleep. Ares turned Alectryon into a [[rooster]], which never forgets to announce the arrival of the sun in the [[morning]].)

In the [[Trojan War]], Ares had no fixed allegiances nor respect for [[Themis]], the right ordering of things: he promised Athena and Hera that he would fight on the side of the Achaeans, but Aphrodite was able to persuade Ares to side with the Trojans. During the war, [[Diomedes]] fought with [[Hector]] and saw Ares fighting on the Trojans' side. Diomedes called for his soldiers to fall back slowly. Hera, Ares's mother, saw his interference and asked Zeus, his father, for permission to drive Ares away from the battlefield. Hera encouraged Diomedes to attack Ares, so he threw a spear at Ares. Athena then drove the spear into Ares's body, who bellowed in pain and fled to Mt. Olympus, forcing the Trojans to fall back.

In post-Renaissance [[emblem]] books, Ares' symbols are a spear and a helmet, his animal the dog and his bird the vulture. In myth and poetry Ares appears as cruel, aggressive, and blood-thirsty. He is notorious among both gods and humans.

==Ares in Neopaganism==

Many modern [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] maintain a somewhat traditional view of Ares. ''Hellenistic'' sects in the [[United States]], discourage worship of Ares altogether. Some sects even forbid Ares worship. Many modern neopagans believe that ancient civilizations believed much the same, but worshipped Ares out of necessity rather than out of devotion. However, many other Neopagans do worship Ares, believing him to be a god who bestows courage, strength and determination in times of hardship and difficulty.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alexander Grothendieck''' ([[Berlin]], [[March 28]], [[1928]]) is one of the most important [[mathematician]]s of the [[20th century]]. He is also one of its most extreme scientific personalities, with achievements over a short span of years that are still scarcely credible in their broad scope and sheer bulk, and an approach that antagonised even close followers. He made major contributions to [[algebraic geometry]], [[homological algebra]], and [[functional analysis]]. He was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in [[1966]], and co-awarded the [[Crafoord Prize]] with [[Pierre Deligne]] in [[1988]]. He declined the latter prize, on ethical grounds.

He is noted for his mastery of abstract approaches to mathematics, and his perfectionism in matters of formulation and presentation. Relatively little of his work after 1960 was published by the conventional route of the [[learned journal]], circulating initially in duplicated volumes of seminar notes; his influence was to a considerable extent personal, on French mathematics and the [[Zariski]] school at [[Harvard University]]. He is the subject of many stories and some misleading rumors, concerning his work habits and politics, confrontations with other mathematicians and the French authorities, his withdrawal from mathematics at age 42, his retirement and his subsequent lengthy writings.

== Mathematical achievements ==

Homological methods and [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory had already been introduced in algebraic geometry by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], after sheaves had been invented by [[Kiyoshi Oka]] and [[Jean Leray]]. Grothendieck took them to a higher level, changing the tools and the level of abstraction. 

Amongst his insights, he shifted attention from the study of individual varieties to the ''[[Grothendieck's relative point of view|relative point of view]]'' (pairs of varieties related by a [[morphism]]), allowing a broad generalization of many classical theorems. This he applied first to the [[Riemann-Roch theorem]], around [[1956]], which had already recently been generalized to any dimension by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch|Hirzebruch]]. The [[Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem]] was announced by Grothendieck at the initial [[Arbeitstagung]] in [[Bonn]], in 1957. It appeared in print in a paper written by [[Armand Borel]] with Serre. 

His foundational work on [[algebraic geometry]] is at a higher level of abstraction than all prior versions. He adapted the use of non-closed [[generic point]]s, which led to the theory of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. He also pioneered the systematic use of [[nilpotent]]s. As 'functions' these can take only the value 0, but they carry infinitesimal information, in purely algebraic settings. His ''theory of schemes'' has become established as the best universal foundation for this major field, because of its great expressive power as well as technical depth. In that setting one can use [[birational geometry]], techniques from [[number theory]], [[Galois theory]] and [[commutative algebra]], and close analogues of the methods of [[algebraic topology]], all in an integrated way. 

Its influence spilled over into many other branches of mathematics, for example the contemporary theory of [[D-module]]s. (It also provoked adverse reactions, with many mathematicians seeking out more concrete areas and problems. Grothendieck is one of the few mathematicians who matches the French concept of [[maître à penser]]; some go further and call him [[maître-penseur]].)  

The bulk of Grothendieck's published work is collected in the monumental, and yet incomplete, ''[[Éléments de géométrie algébrique]]'' (EGA) and ''[[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]]'' (SGA).  Perhaps Grothendieck's deepest single accomplishment is the invention of the [[étale cohomology|étale]] and l-adic cohomology theories, which explain an observation of [[André Weil]]'s, that there is a deep connection between the topological characteristics of a variety and its diophantine (number theoretic) properties. For example, the number of solutions of an equation over a [[finite field]] reflects the topological nature of its solutions over the [[complex number]]s. Weil realized that to prove such a connection one needed a new cohomology theory, but neither he nor any other expert saw how to do this until such a theory was found by Grothendieck. This program culminated in the proofs of the [[Weil conjecture]]s by Grothendieck's student [[Pierre Deligne]] in the early 1970s after Grothendieck had largely withdrawn from mathematics.

=== Major mathematical topics (from [[Récoltes et Semailles]]) ===

He wrote a retrospective assessment of his mathematical work (see the external link ''La Vision'' below). As his main mathematical achievements (&quot;maître-thèmes&quot;), he chose this collection of 12 topics (his chronological order):

#[[Topological tensor product]]s and [[nuclear space]]s
#&quot;Continual&quot; and &quot;discrete&quot; [[duality]] ([[derived category|derived categories]] and &quot;[[six operations (mathematics)|six operations]]&quot;). 
#''Yoga'' of the [[Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem]] ([[K-theory]], relation with [[intersection theory]]). 
#[[Scheme (mathematics)|Scheme]]s. 
#[[topos|Toposes]]. 
#[[Étale cohomology]] including [[l-adic cohomology]]. 
#[[Motive (mathematics)|Motive]]s and the [[motivic Galois group]] (and [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck categories]])
#[[Crystal (mathematics)|Crystal]]s and [[crystalline cohomology]], ''yoga'' of De Rham and Hodge coefficients.
#[[Topological algebra]], infinity-stacks, 'dérivateurs', cohomological formalism of toposes as an inspiration for a new [[homotopic algebra]]
#[[Tame topology]].
#''Yoga'' of [[anabelian geometry]] and [[Galois-Teichmüller theory]]. 
#Schematic point of view, or &quot;arithmetics&quot; for [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]] and [[regular configurations]] of all sorts.

He wrote that the central theme of the topics above is that of [[topos]] theory, while the first and last were of the least importance to him.

Here the usage of ''yoga'' means a kind of 'meta-theory' that can be used heuristically. The word ''yoke'', meaning a linkage, is derived from the same Indo-European root.

== Life ==
=== Childhood and studies ===

Born to a Russian Jewish father and German Protestant mother in [[Berlin]], he was a [[displaced person]] during much of his childhood due to the upheavals of [[World War II]]. Alexander lived with his father, Alexander Shapiro, and his mother, Hanka Grothendieck, both of whom were [[socialism|socialist]] [[revolutionary|revolutionaries]].  Until [[1933]] they lived together in [[Berlin]].  At the end of that year, Shapiro moved to [[Paris]], and Hanka followed him the next year. They left Alexander with a family in [[Hamburg]] where he went to school. During this time, his parents fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In [[1939]] Alexander came to France and lived in various camps for displaced persons with his mother. His father was sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] where he died in [[1942]]. After the war, young Grothendieck studied mathematics in [[France]], initially at [[Montpellier]].  He had decided to become a math teacher because he had been told that mathematical research had been completed early in the [[20th century]] and there were no more open problems.  However, his talent was noticed, and he was encouraged to go to [[Paris]] in [[1948]].  Initially, Grothendieck attended Élie Cartan's Seminar at [[École Normale Superieure]] , but lacking the neccessary background to follow the high powered seminar, he moved to University of Nancy where he wrote his dissertation under [[Laurent Schwartz]] in functional analysis, from [[1950]]. At this time he was a leading expert in the theory of [[topological vector space]]s. However he set this subject aside by [[1957]] in order to work in algebraic geometry and [[homological algebra]].

=== Politics and retreat from scientific community ===

Grothendieck's radical left-wing and pacifist politics were doubtless born by his family history and his wartime experiences. He gave lectures on [[category theory]] in the forests surrounding [[Hanoi]] while the city was being bombed, to protest against the [[Vietnam war]]. He retired from scientific life around [[1970]], after having discovered the partly military funding of [[IHES]] (see pp. xii and xiii of SGA1, Springer Lecture Notes 224). He returned to academia a few years later as a professor at the University of [[Montpellier]], where he stayed until
his retirement in 1988. His criticisms of the scientific community are also contained in a [http://www.math.columbia.edu/~lipyan/CrafoordPrize.pdf letter] written in 1988, in which he states the reasons for his refusal of the [[Crafoord Prize]].

=== Manuscripts written in the 1980s ===

While not publishing mathematical research in conventional ways during the 1980s, he produced several influential manuscripts with limited distribution, with both mathematical and biographical content. 

''[[La longue marche à travers la theorie de Galois]]'' (roughly ''The Long Walk Through Galois Theory'') is an approximately 1600-page handwritten manuscript produced by Grothendieck during the years 1980-1981 and contains many of the ideas leading to the ''[[Esquisse d'un Programme]]'' (see below) and in particular studies the Teichmüller theory.

In 1983 he wrote a huge extended manuscript (about 600 pages) titled ''[[Pursuing Stacks]]'', starting with a letter addressed to [[Daniel Quillen]]. This letter and successive  parts were distributed from Bangor (see External Links below): in an informal manner, as a kind of diary, Grothendieck  explained and developed his ideas on the relationship between [[algebraic homotopy theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]] and prospects for a noncommutative theory of [[Stack (category theory)|stacks]].  The manuscript, which is being edited for publication by G. Maltsiniotis, later led to another of his monumental works ''[[Les Dérivateurs]]''.  Written in 1991 this latter opus of about 2000 pages further developed the homotopical ideas begun in ''[[Pursuing Stacks]]''.  Much of this work anticipated the subsequent development of the motivic homotopy theory of [[F. Morel]] and [[V. Voevodsky]] in the mid 1990s.

His ''[[Esquisse d'un programme]]'' ([[1984]]) is a proposal for a position at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]], which he held from 1984 to his retirement in 1988. Ideas from it have proved influential, and have been developed by others, in particular in a new field emerging as [[anabelian geometry]]. In ''[[La Clef des Songes]]'' he explains how the reality of [[dream]]s convinced him of [[God]]'s existence.

The 2000-page autobiographical manuscript ''[[Récoltes et Semailles]]'' (1986) is now partly available on the internet in the French original, and an English translation is underway (these parts of Récoltes et Semailles are already [http://imperium.lenin.ru/%7Everbit/Grothendieck/Grothendieck.html translated to Russian] and published in Moscow).

=== Disappearance ===

In 1991, he left his home and disappeared. He is said to now live in the South
of France and to entertain no visitors. Various false rumors have him living in [[Ardèche]], herding goats and entertaining radical ecological theories. Though he has been inactive in mathematics for many years, he remains one of the greatest and most influential mathematicians of modern times.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Antidisestablishmentarianism''' originated in the context of the [[nineteenth century]] [[Church of England]], where &quot;antidisestablishmentarians&quot; were opposed to proposals to remove the Church's status as the [[State religion|state church]] of [[England]]. The movement succeeded in England, but failed in [[Ireland]] and [[Wales]], with the [[Church of Ireland]] being disestablished in [[1871]] and the [[Church in Wales]] in [[1920]].  Antidisestablishmentarian members of the [[Free_Church_of_Scotland_%281843-1900%29#Unions_and_relationships_with_other_Presbyterians|Free Church of Scotland]] delayed merger with the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] in a dispute about the position of the [[Church of Scotland]]. The term has largely fallen into disuse, although the issue itself is still current (see [[Act of Settlement 1701]]).

The word ''antidisestablishmentarianism'', with 28 letters, is often quoted as being one of the [[Longest word in the English language|longest English words]] that has an actual meaning (as opposed to words that were made up for the purpose of being long). In fact, its claim is quite good, since ''antidisestablishmentarianism'' is used seriously in academic and ecclesiasticalist writing
about the Church of England when the concept arises, which it does occasionally (See
e.g. Hastings and &quot;Some notes on the Church of England and Establishment&quot;, below). However, since [[1992]] it has lost this title to [[floccinaucinihilipilification]] in the [[Guinness Book of Records]]. It might still be the longest word not invented for the specific purpose of being a long word, however, because the word floccinaucinihilipilification was invented as a joke and is an amalgamation of four different Latin words. Presumably it was made, at least partly, to make fun of long words.

==In fiction==
In the ''[[Honeymooners]]'' episode, ''[[The $99,000 Answer]]'', Alice asks Ralph to spell this word. Ralph says he'll spell if she gives him $16,000 for spelling. She tells him she'll give him twice the amount if he can say it{{fact}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alcoholics Anonymous''' (known commonly as &quot;'''A.A.'''&quot; or &quot;'''AA'''&quot;) is a world-wide fellowship of [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]s whose stated primary purpose is to stay sober and to carry the message of recovery from alcoholism through the Twelve Steps.  A.A. is the original [[twelve-step program]] and has been the source and model for all subsequent and separate ones, such as [[Gamblers Anonymous]], [[Narcotics Anonymous]],  [[Sexaholics Anonymous]], [[Overeaters Anonymous]], and [[Al-Anon/Alateen]].

An earlier group for alcoholics, known as the [[Washingtonian movement|Washingtonians]], fell apart when it tried to branch out to different goals, which A.A. has tried to avoid.

Many have claimed A.A. to be the most successful treatment for alcoholism ever devised.  Though some take issue with this claim - and A.A. itself makes no such formal claim - the opinion is widely accepted because no other program has attained the same level of prominence.  Dissenters have argued that there are no controlled double blind scientific studies to back the claims and that reputable scientific research casts doubts on the effectiveness of [[12 step treatment | such programs]][http://www.unhooked.com/booktalk/hester_miller_handbook.html].  One factor that complicates research into AA effectiveness is the difficulty of gathering statistical information on a membership that stresses anonymity as an essential characteristic of the fellowship.

A.A. literature describes a difference between an &quot;alcoholic&quot; and a &quot;hard drinker,&quot; claiming that unlike a hard drinker, who may drink enough alcohol to cause gradual physical and mental impairment but nevertheless retains the ability to stop or moderate his or her drinking, given sufficiently strong reasons (Alcoholics Anonymous, p. 20-21)), an alcoholic has a disease which renders him/her bodily and mentally different from others. A.A. considers alcoholism to be a diagnosis which can only be made by oneself, and has no opinion on abstinence for others.
There also exist a number of purely secular non-12 step programs which promote abstinence as a recovery goal, as well as programs which promote a goal of moderation for &quot;problem drinkers&quot; as opposed to &quot;alcoholics.&quot;  A listing can be found in the external links section of this article. None has achieved the same wide-spread use and recognition as AA, and none is without its own controversies.

Some people object to [[teetotalism|abstinence]] as a goal, preferring other programs which aim for moderation. [http://www.habitsmart.com/cntrldnk.html] Others  advocate [[harm reduction]] as the most effective step towards addressing the immediate social problems caused by abuse of alcohol and other drugs. 

==History and development==
A.A. was started by two alcoholics who first met on [[May 12]], [[1935]]. One was [[William Griffith Wilson|Bill Wilson]] (William Griffith Wilson), a New York stockbroker; the other was Dr. [[Bob Smith (doctor)|Bob Smith]] (Robert Holbrook Smith), a medical doctor and surgeon from [[Akron, Ohio]].  In A.A. circles, the former is known as &quot;Bill W.&quot; and the latter, &quot;Dr. Bob.&quot;

[[Image:BILLNBOB.JPG|thumb|none|left|Dr Bob Smith (left) and Bill Wilson (right), the co-founders of A.A.]]

Wilson had been sober since December 11th, 1934 (six months) when he met Smith, although he had struggled with sobriety for years. In that time he had made several important discoveries about his own alcoholism. 

Firstly he had learned from a New York alcoholism specialist, Dr. [[William Duncan Silkworth]], that alcoholism was not simply a moral weakness. Silkworth told Wilson, during one of Wilson's admissions to his drying-out clinic, that alcoholism had a pathological disease-like character. He told Wilson that, in his view, alcoholism was akin to an allergy, in the sense that it produced abnormal reactions to alcohol that were not observed in non-alcoholic drinkers; he called these reactions a &quot;phenomenon of craving&quot; -- once started drinking, the alcoholic finds it very difficult to stop.  In addition, Dr. Silkworth told Wilson that alcoholics had a mental obsession that gave them reasons to return to alcohol after periods of sobriety, even knowing that they would then develop overwhelming cravings.  This &quot;double whammy&quot; (as he called it) meant that the alcoholic could not stop once started, and could not stop from starting again. This explained the enormous recidivism rate of alcoholics.

Wilson also discovered that some alcoholics were able to recover on a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] basis. This approach had been used by one of Wilson's old drinking buddies, Ebby Thacher, to get sober. Thacher had learned about the spiritual approach from Rowland H., an American business executive and alcoholic who had undergone treatment with the famous Swiss analytical psychologist Dr. [[Carl Jung]]. After a prolonged and unsuccessful period of therapy, Jung told Rowland that his case, like that of most alcoholics, was nigh on hopeless. Rowland was horrified and begged Jung to tell him anything that might help. Jung replied there was only one hope: a genuine spiritual conversion experience. History, he said, had recorded isolated examples of recovery from alcoholism that appeared solely attributable to the spiritual conversion of the alcoholic. He told Rowland to seek out a conversion experience.

Rowland H. returned to America and found a means to a [[spiritual awakening]] through the [[Oxford Group]], a self-styled first-Century Christian movement that advocated finding god through moral inventory, confession of defects, restitution, reliance upon god, and helping others.  It appeared that a spiritual awakening would relieve alcoholics of the mental obsession that kept sending them back to alcoholism after periods of sobriety.  Note that Wilson later (''Alcoholics Anonymous comes of age'', New York: Harper; 1957, p. 39) credited A.A.'s ideas of self examination, acknowledgement of character defects, restitution for harm done, and working with others, to the religious influence of Rev. Samuel Moor Shoemaker and the Oxford Group Movement. 

Following one of Wilson's relapses, he returned to the hospital where he was sedated and detoxified. He prayed in bed during his recovery: &quot;If there be a God, will He show himself! The result was instant, electric, beyond description. The place seemed to light up, blinding white. I knew only ecstasy and seemed on a mountain. A great wind blew, enveloping and penetrating me. To me, it was not of air, but of Spirit. Blazing, there came the tremendous thought. 'You are a free man.' Then the ecstasy subsided. I now found myself in a new world of consciousness which was suffused by a Presence. One with the universe, a great peace stole over me&quot; (Three talks to medical societies by Bill W., co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. New York; Alcoholics Anonymous World Services; 1973, p.10).

Wilson questioned whether he had a genuine [[religious experience]] (see also [[peak experiences]])or was on the verge of madness. Dr. Silkworth advised him that &quot;hopeless alcoholics&quot; sometimes report conversion experiences before being &quot;turned around&quot; toward recovery.  He referred Wilson to [[William James]]' ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/621 Varieties of Religious Experience]'' and directed him to Lectures IX and X, dealing with conversion.  James states in the first paragraph of Lecture IX,  &quot;To be converted, to be regenerated, to receive grace, to experience religion, to gain an assurance, are so many phrases which denote the process, gradual or sudden, by which a self hitherto divided, and consciously wrong, inferior and unhappy, becomes unified and consciously right, superior and happy, in consequence of its firmer hold upon religious realities.  This at least is what conversion signifies in general terms, whether or not we believe that a direct divine operation is needed to bring such a moral change about.&quot; Lecture VIII, &quot;The Divided Self&quot; also refers to the condition before conversion.  In ''When A.A. Came of Age'', Wilson states that Dr. Silkworth &quot;reminded me of Professor William James's observation that truly transforming spiritual experiences are nearly always founded on calamity and collapse.&quot;

James' Lectures IX and X discussed the conversion of &quot;Mr. S. H. Hadley, who after his conversion became an active and useful rescuer of
drunkards in New York.&quot; His footnote 104 states &quot;I have abridged Mr. Hadley's account.  For other conversions of drunkards, see his pamphlet, Rescue Mission Work, published at the Old Jerry McAuley Water Street Mission, New York City.  A striking collection of cases also appears in the appendix to Professor Leuba's article.&quot;

William James cited the works of James H. Leuba and Edwin D. Starbuck frequently. Leuba quoted sections of ''Autobiography'' by John B. Gough, who describes his depression as an alcoholic.  Leuba also points out that self-surrender is necessary for conversion. He quotes S. H. Hadley and comments &quot;In this record the approach towards complete surrender can be followed step by step. He has laid aside pride enough to respond to the invitation and thereby confess publicly his inability to cease drinking. Old crimes, and that which the settlement of them will require of him, pass before his mind; for a moment he hesitates to accept the attitude towards them which submission to God would demand. His humble prayer for succor, and its effect, indicate that all the resistance of which he is conscious had given away, and that, as he called upon Christ, he threw himself unreservedly at his feet.&quot;

Starbuck describes conversion following what A.A. came to refer to as &quot;hitting rock bottom.&quot; When &quot;the divine urging has become imperative and irresistible. Here is the critical point, the tragic moment. The subject resorts to evasion of good influences, pointing out the perfection of the present self, the imperfection of others, and anything to preserve the old self intact. It is more often a distress, a deep undefinable feeling of reluctance, which is perhaps a complex of all surface considerations which a thorough break in habits and associations would involve. He continues until complete exhaustion takes away the power of striving; he becomes nothing; his will is broken; he surrenders himself to the higher forces that are trying to claim him; he accepts the higher life as his own.&quot;

Most importantly, Wilson found that his own sobriety seemed to grow stronger when he shared his personal alcoholic experience with other alcoholics.   Wilson was on the verge of a relapse on a business trip to Akron.  In a hotel lobby, he decided to phone local ministers and ask if they knew of alcoholics he could talk to.  Thus he was introduced to Smith.  Had it not been for Wilson's decision to reach out to a fellow sufferer, AA would not exist today.

These were the ideas that he presented to Smith, who had been struggling with his own chronic drinking addiction. The two struck up a solid friendship and together they put Wilson's discoveries into practice. Smith's last drink is said to have been [[June 10]], [[1935]], and that is considered within A.A. to be the date of the founding of A.A. Their first publication in 1939, ''Alcoholics Anonymous'', the first 164 pages of which have remained virtually unchanged since then, has been a perennial best-seller.  The fellowship began to be called &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; after the publication of this book.  Given this start, it is no surprise that A.A. groups and members are frequently called &quot;Friends of Bill W.&quot;

The [[AA Grapevine]] is the international journal of Alcoholics Anonymous. It is written, edited, illustrated, and read by A.A. members and others interested in the A.A. program of recovery from the disease of alcoholism.

The growth of A.A., especially in its early years, was striking. In 2002, the General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous reported more than 100,000 A.A. groups in 150 countries, with a total membership of approximately two million alcoholics.

==How the A.A. program works==
Although some believe that A.A's success lies in the sense of support its members gain from attending regular meetings, many members, as well as A.A's literature, hold that the essence of the program is the Twelve Steps. The Steps incorporate Dr. Silkworth's description of the two-fold problem of physical allergy and mental obsession in Step One, Dr. Jung's description of the spiritual solution in Step Two, the Oxford Groups' method of reaching a spiritual awakening in Steps Three through Eleven, and Wilson's experience in helping others in Step Twelve.  The process of working the Steps is sometimes summed up as &quot;Trust god, clean house, and help others.&quot;  (See [[twelve-step program]] for a list of the steps themselves.)

A.A. members are encouraged to &quot;work the Steps&quot;, usually with the guidance of a voluntary sponsor. (A sponsor is a more experienced member who has worked the Steps before, usually of the same sex as the sponsee, and freely chosen - and just as freely &quot;fired&quot;- by the sponsee.) The Steps are designed to help the alcoholic achieve a spiritual, emotional and mental state conducive to lasting sobriety. There are many long-term A.A. members who claim that working the Steps has freed them entirely from the urge to drink alcohol. Whereas staying sober was once difficult and uncertain, these members report that sobriety is now much easier, provided they keep working the A.A. program.

Most members regard attendance at A.A. meetings as important to their sobriety (although there are groups in A.A. made up of loners and members living in remote locations who communicate by mail and internet). Even members with decades of continuous sobriety still go to meetings regularly. There is no compulsion or requirement to attend. Members may attend as few or as many meetings as they wish, as frequently or infrequently as they like.  However, new members are encouraged to go to 90 meetings in 90 days, and a sponsor may set his or her own expectations for a sponsee's attendance. No official membership or attendance records are kept at any level in A.A. However there are annually published estimates which are available through AAs headquarters in New York City, known as &quot;GSO&quot; (General Service Office).

With the above in mind, a typical individual program of recovery for a newcomer may include:
*  Above all, avoiding the first drink.
*  Attendance at one or more meetings daily for 90 days or longer.  Some people coming into A.A. have attended meetings daily for the first year. (Note: nowhere in A.A. literature is there a reference to frequent attendance at A.A. meetings. Many A.A.s believe this notion started in the treatment center industry; graduating patients were advised to attend many A.A. meetings, presumably in an effort to acquire a new peer group of abstinent friends to reinforce the effects of treatment.  Regardless of source, this recommendation is consistent with a suggestion commonly heard in A.A. that one in recovery should &quot;change playgrounds and playmates.&quot;)
*  Contact with one's sponsor daily in order to work the steps and to discuss whatever problems one may be having in one's life, problems which may, if not addressed, lead the alcoholic to take the first drink:  &quot;One [drink] is too many and one thousand [drinks] never enough.&quot;
*  Daily prayer and/or meditation, as suggested by Step 11: &quot;Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with god ''as we understood him,'' praying only for knowledge of his will for us and the power to carry that out.&quot;
*  Daily attention to Step 10:  &quot;Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.&quot;
*  Service work, which, for the newcomer, can be as uncomplicated as making coffee at meetings, helping to set up and break down tables and chairs, etc.

It will be noted that the program is to be worked ''daily'' and done so ''one day at a time.''  Frequently heard at meetings:  &quot;I'm a winner today, no matter what happens, as long as I don't pick up that first drink.&quot;

A common feature of A.A. meetings is that members are asked to speak to the group about their experience with alcoholism and recovery. However, there is no requirement to speak. Some members speak every time they are asked; others simply sit and listen in meetings for years before they say anything;  some may choose never to speak.

A.A. does not charge membership fees to attend meetings, but instead relies on whatever donations members choose to give to cover basic costs like room rental, coffee, etc. Contributions from members are limited to a maximum annual amount. A.A. is self-supporting and is not a charity. It accepts no subsidies from any non-A.A. source and donations of money or other items of value from such sources are not accepted.

A.A. receives proceeds from sale of its book ''Alcoholics Anonymous'' along with other A.A. published books and literature, which are periodically reviewed from a cost standpoint so that printed materials can be priced to be self-sustaining while not actually being a source of profit for the organization.

Many A.A. groups use the famous [[Serenity Prayer]] and many AA groups in the Southern United States often close their meeting with [[The Lord's Prayer]].

==Beliefs about alcoholism==
There is no official creed of A.A. belief about alcoholism, since individual members are free to believe whatever they wish based on their own experiences. Even the core twelve step program is presented to members as suggested rather than mandatory. While AA literature states that &quot;our twelve steps are only suggestions&quot;, many more traditionally-minded members claim that today's decreased emphasis on &quot;Step Work&quot; has resulted in a drastic decline in AA's success rate. In the early days of AA, say critics of today's meeting-centered brand of Alcoholics Anonymous, the 12 Steps were mandatory and attendance at meetings were optional. They claim that during this time, AA experienced 75-90% success rates of recovery{{fact}}. In recent years however, the Fellowship has shifted its views greatly and now many veteran AA members advise newcomers that  meetings are mandatory while placing less emphasis on &quot;working the steps&quot;. Some blame this lessened emphasis on The Twelve Steps for a first-time sobriety success rate of approximately 5%, according to an internal study conducted by AA Intergroup in 1988. Other estimates put overall success rates however somewhere between 5 and 10%.  Given that AA's membership is by definition, anonymous, and its administrative body -- the General Service Office, General Service Board and annual General Service Conference -- acknowledges the importance of anonymity, no records are kept on AA members, so non-anectdotal data about success rates cannot be obtained from official AA sources.


Many A.A. members share similar views on alcoholism and most would agree with the following statements:

* '''Alcoholism has no cure.''' Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic. There is no way to make a &quot;normal&quot; drinker out of an alcoholic. Nor is there any way to make a non-alcoholic into an alcoholic. Alcoholics who do not drink can recover and function in normal society, but should they drink again, their active alcoholism will re-emerge quickly and be as debilitating as before. This is true even in cases where alcoholics have remained sober for many years before relapsing. The concept that &quot;alcoholism has no cure&quot; is one at variance with the remarks of A.A.'s two founders--each of whom specifically stated he had been &quot;cured.&quot; So too A.A. Number Three (Bill D.) who stated he had been cured by the Lord. See Big Book, p. 191. In fact, for almost a decade after A.A.'s founding, all members from the mid-west and newspapers across U.S. trumpeted the fact that they had been cured and that the cure was reliance on the Creator. See Dick B. Cured; When Early AAs Were Cured and Why.

* '''Alcoholism is a progressive illness.''' Over time, alcoholics who continue to drink will get worse. Those who keep drinking will often die from alcohol-related causes or be institutionalized (prison, hospital or asylum).

* '''The first drink does the damage.''' Once an alcoholic takes a drink, a powerful craving for more alcohol sets in. This makes moderation or controlled drinking nearly impossible. Thus the A.A. approach of abstinence. Without the first drink, the craving cannot occur. Much of the A.A. program is intended to help the alcoholic stay stopped, thereby preventing the compulsive drinking cycle from starting.

* '''The desire to stop drinking needs to come from the alcoholic.''' This often happens as a result of the alcoholic realizing that his or her life has become unmanageable and that excessive drinking is the cause. A.A. members call this &quot;hitting bottom&quot; - a potentially life-changing moment when the alcoholic perceives an urgent need for major personal change.

* '''An Alcoholic cannot recover on his or her own.''' An alcoholic needs (or will benefit from) the fellowship of the AA program. Contact with other alcoholics provides an essential ingredient to the process of recovery. AA meetings may be important, along with reading AA materials and working the steps -- but it is working with other alcoholics, helping and being helped, talking and interacting, that allow an alcoholic to do what he or she cannot do alone -- stay sober.

==Structure==

The affairs of A.A. are governed broadly by A.A.'s [[Twelve Traditions]]. A.A. has a minimal amount of organized structure. There is no hierarchy of leaders and no formal control structure. People who accept service positions within the Fellowship are known only as &quot;trusted servants.&quot;  Individual A.A. members and groups cannot be compelled to do anything by &quot;higher&quot; A.A. authorities. Each A.A. group, small or large, is considered a self-supporting and self-governing entity. A.A. does maintain offices and service centres which have the task of co-ordinating activities like printing literature, responding to public enquiries and organizing state or national conferences. These offices are funded by local A.A. members and are directly responsible to the A.A. groups in the region or country they represent. (For more information, see A.A.'s [[Twelve Traditions]] as set out in the A.A. &quot;Big Book&quot; [http://www.aa.org/bigbookonline/ Alcoholics Anonymous] and discussed in detail in the A.A. book ''Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions''.)

==A.A., religion and the law==

U.S. judges continue to require attendance at AA meetings as a condition of probation or parole or as an element of a sentence for defendents convicted of a crime. A federal appeals court ruled in 1999 that doing so compromises the First Amendment right not to have religion dictated to them by government - because A.A. practices and doctrine are (in the words of the district court judge who wrote Griffin v. Coughlin) &quot;unequivocally religious&quot;. The United States Supreme Court denied certiori and let this decision stand.

While A.A. World Services Inc. [the legal entity of the program as a whole] and A.A.'s General Service Office [the legal entity of A.A. in the U.S. and Canada] do not favor coercion regarding meeting attendance, their failure to unequivocally condemn the practice (and promulgate their condemnation at the cell level) is interpreted by some as tacit approval. A.A. experience long suggests that the program works best for people who seek sobriety of their own free will. The Third Tradition of A.A. states &quot;The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking.&quot; Those forced to attend meetings may not have any desire to stop drinking. Nevertheless, it is true that some members claim to owe their recovery to the fact they were ordered to go to A.A. by a judge or doctor. A.A. welcomes everyone at its meetings, including those who are there only because a court or other external authority compelled them.

The A.A. program contains spiritual ideas, but it does not promote any particular [[religion]] over others, and it has worked for adherents of many faiths, including Christians, Buddhists, Jews and Muslims as well as for many who identify with no religion. Nevertheless, since it suggests that the recovering alcoholic seeks help from a &quot;Higher Power,&quot; some [[atheism|atheists]] and those not looking for a &quot;spiritual&quot; solution find themselves unable to accept A.A.'s Twelve Steps and instead seek out secular alternatives. Many others have been able to adapt the concept of a &quot;Higher Power&quot; in a manner that works for them, and there is a chapter of the book ''Alcoholics Anonymous'' called &quot;We Agnostics&quot; that speaks directly to agnostics and agnosticism.  It counsels that even those members who &quot;thought we were atheists or agnostics&quot; were able to &quot;lay aside prejudice and express even a willingness to believe in a Power greater than ourselves ... even though it was impossible for any of us to fully define or comprehend that Power, which is god&quot; and &quot;had to stop doubting the power of god&quot; because &quot;deep down in every man, woman, and child, is the fundamental idea of god.&quot; (quotes from ''Alcoholics Anonymous'', 4th Edition, p. 44, 46, 52, 55) Many alcoholics arrive at A.A. with a strong disbelief towards spiritual ideas. A.A. members usually counsel attendees with such beliefs to keep attending despite their perceived conflicting beliefs. The attitude towards these cases is usually the same as in the ''Alcoholics Anonymous'' book, they believe that eventually atheists and agnostics will &quot;come around&quot; to believing in a &quot;higher power.&quot; Many agnostics and atheists find this attitude offensive and condescending, because they interpret such statments as being tantamount to saying that atheist and agnostics have simply not thought about the implications enough to come to see what A.A. adherents see as a basic &quot;truth.&quot;  It should also be noted that many believers reject AA's spiritualism as well. 

Many alcoholics who arrive at A.A. without belief in a god use the group itself as their &quot;Higher Power.&quot;  One such alcoholic defined &quot;GOD&quot; as &quot;Group Of Drunks&quot; until he was able to discover a spiritual concept of god which worked for him. Other A.A. members point out that there are many powers greater than one's self to choose from.  The idea that this power must be God is not necessarily true for everyone.  Some A.A. members choose some principle, such as the truth, or compassion, or the law of impermanence and constant change and surrender to that principle as their &quot;higher power&quot;.  Others may focus on the program itself, defining &quot;GOD&quot; as &quot;Good Orderly Direction.&quot;  On the other hand, newcomers are cautioned that it is unwise to use any one person, such as a sponsor, as their higher power in that all individual human beings are fallible and, in the case of another recovering alcoholic, no matter how long his or her sobriety, capable of relapse.  The basic idea is that, in order to recover, the alcoholic must &quot;surrender,&quot; meaning that he or she must admit his or her powerlessness over alcohol and unmanageability of life and must stop depending only on self, while beginning to rely on help from a &quot;power greater than [one's self],&quot; whatever the precise nature of that power.  Many recovering alcoholics would agree with the statement:  &quot;I had done things my way long enough, and all it got me was drunk.  I decided it was time to start following directions.&quot;  

Ironically, it has been the experience of some A.A. &quot;old timers&quot; (recovering alcoholics with many years of uninterrupted sobriety) that active alcoholics who seek recovery in A.A. without having a prior religious concept of god may have a better chance of lasting recovery than their more religious counterparts.  This seems to be true because the former may find it easier to focus on working the program itself, instead of using previously-held religious beliefs as a rationalization for seeking an &quot;easier softer way.&quot;  However, as stated elsewhere, many people who come to A.A. with all sorts of religious beliefs, or the lack thereof, have found long-lasting recovery from alcoholism in A.A. &quot;one day at a time.&quot;

Finally, many AA members would agree with the idea that most members *begin* AA involvement as a result of some form of coercion, whether from family, a spouse, a boss or supervisor, or the courts. Even those who are not pressured by others are nonetheless pressured by circumstances -- they have &quot;hit rock bottom&quot; and decided that the pain of drinking and the consequences of drinking are too severe to be tolerated. Regardless of initial pressures, many AA members come to value their involvement with the AA program and embrace sobriety for the benefits it brings them.

==Discussion of the Merits of A.A.==

Though there is little doubt that A.A. is the number one treatment for
alcoholism in the world today, it has its detractors.

(Note: in this section, BB refers to ''The Big Book'', aka ''Alcoholics Anonymous'', 3rd Edition, by the first 100 members of Alcoholics Anonymous, and 12x12 refers to ''Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions'', by William G. Wilson) Note: in 2001 the 4th edition of Alcoholics Anonymous, was released. The first 164 pages (including the doctors opinion), of the BB have been left intact and unchanged since the book's initial publication in 1939. The only change in each edition, aside from some minor updating of the basic text from the first to the second edition, has been the addition and/or deletion of some of the stories in the back of the book.

===AA's Supporters===

On one hand, supporters claim that AA is an indispensable support group for people seeking to free themselves of an addiction to alcohol.  Some things they cite include:

* The [[American Medical Association]] supports the disease model of alcoholism that was developed in the early part of the 20th century and embraced by AA.
* A large amount of [[anecdotal evidence]] in which people assert that joining AA saved their lives [http://www.aa-uk.org.uk/alcoholics-anonymous-reviews/2005/05/lot-of-bottle.html] [http://www.aa-uk.org.uk/alcoholics-anonymous-reviews/2005/05/i-was-taught-to-take-my-life-one-day.html] [http://www.aa.org/default/en_about_aa_sub.cfm?subpageid=68&amp;pageid=12] [http://www.aamolly.org.uk/alexg.htm]
* Long-term sobriety lengths of 20, 30, or 40 or more years are not uncommon in AA.
* Many members find that AA is [[fun]].  While meetings can be serious, they can also be filled with [[laughter]].  Social activities such as dances, picnics, and conventions are enjoyed by great numbers of AAs.  Many members discover that their fears of never again having fun after quitting drinking have proven false.  Many AA's believe that engaging in therapeutic [[recreation]] that does not include alcohol helps them to stay away from drinking.
* Because of the large number of AA groups (over 100,000 worldwide as of 2001), AA members are free to try different groups until they find groups that they enjoy.  Because AA members come from all walks of life and every segment of [[society]], there is a tremendous amount of variety within the [[fellowship]].  Not only do these facts make it difficult to [[generalize]] about AA groups, but these circumstances allow for a level of flexibility that accommodates the sobriety needs of a large spectrum of recovering alcoholics.
* The fact that AA does not require a belief in any specific higher power means that AA is not a [[religion]].  Since members are free to choose any higher power they like--including higher powers that are not spiritually based--and since members are allowed to change higher powers whenever they like, this agility facilitates a kind of [[transference]] that aids in recovery from alcoholism.  By this definition, an alcoholic is a person who has turned alcohol into a higher power.  By selecting an alternate higher power of his or her own choice and/or design, the alcoholic is able to achieve the psychological transference that topples alcohol as a higher power.  As the alcoholic progresses in [[recovery]] over months and years, this same flexibility allows the recovering alcoholic to switch to higher powers that are more individually appropriate to that AA member at that given time.
* &quot;Doing the footwork and turning over the results.&quot;  Contrary to occasional criticism, the AA program encourages members to act as individuals and to think for themselves.  Not only must they design the pace of their own programs and choose their own higher powers with which to supplant alcohol, but they must do their own &quot;footwork&quot; in all areas of their lives.  The [[individual]] in AA is fully empowered to do his or her own footwork.  When the AA program speaks of &quot;powerlessness,&quot; this applies to the ''results'' of the footwork.  This distinction is expressed in the words, &quot;Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.&quot;  In life, footwork is always changeable by the individual, while results are often uncertain, unpredictable, and/or out of the individual's control.
* The &quot;Toolbox Principle.&quot;  Many AA's see the program as a large &quot;toolbox.&quot;  Not everyone feels comfortable with all of the tools all of the time.  Many AA's find that they can stay sober while using some tools and not others, or using different tools at different times.  This flexibility allows members to reach for the specific help they need at specific times, then use a different kind of help as circumstances fluctuate.
* [[Enlightened self-interest]]:  Many AA's believe that in order for an alcoholic to stay sober, he or she must be in the program for him- or herself.  According to this perspective, an AA member does not work the program for the sake of his family, his job, his community, or for the sake of any AA group or AA as a whole.  An alcoholic works the program for himself, and helps others primarily because it helps oneself.
* Every AA member is free to have a sponsor of his or her own choice or not to have a sponsor at all.  Some AA's have more than one sponsor at one time.  Some AA's have a sponsor or sponsors at the beginning of sobriety, then choose not to have sponsors later on.  A member may &quot;fire&quot; a sponsor at any time, and vice versa.  Because AA members are learning to become individually empowered, it is their [[responsibility]] to select appropriate sponsors and change sponsors when necessary.  The great variety of available sponsors is another aspect of the program's flexibility in terms of the shifting needs of individual members.
* Many members and groups acknowledge that AA isn't the right program for everyone, and that there are effective alternatives for other individuals.
* The 12 steps are suggestions rather than requirements (though &quot;they are 'suggested' in the same way that, if you jump out of an airplane with a parachute, it is 'suggested' that you pull the ripcord&quot; (''Daily Reflections; A Book of Reflections by A.A. members for A.A. members'', Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., pg. 344))
* There are no official membership records, allowing members to come and go as they choose (see [[Alcoholics Anonymous#A.A..2C religion and the law|above]] for the exception to this, which AA itself does not sanction)
* Despite Bill W.'s claim that members are &quot;impersonally and severely disciplined from without&quot; in a letter to Dr. Harry Tiebout (quoted in ''Not-God: A History of Alcoholics Anonymous'', Ernest Kurtz, page 129, a book put out by a publisher which publishes much addiction literature), AA lacks any sort of formal disciplinary measures against members who fail to adhere strictly to the program
* The claim that AA is spiritual, not religious, and that the requisite Higher Power can be anything including god (as the individual understands Him, according to the [[12 steps#The twelve steps|3rd Step]]), the group itself (one [http://www.wtv-zone.com/Liandre/Liandres/400_AA_Slogans.html slogan]: &quot;G.O.D.='''G'''ood '''O'''rderly '''D'''irection), a philosophical system, a dead person, the universe, nature, a principle or anything the individual member chooses to invent.  AA philosophy acknowledges that all rational people admit the existence of powers greater than themselves, and that this is in fact one of the definitions of a [[rational]] person.
* The [http://www.wtv-zone.com/Liandre/Liandres/400_AA_Slogans.html slogan] that says to &quot;Take what you can use and leave the rest.&quot;  Members are also reminded that AA will work for them only if they work the program.
* The lack of a guru-like figure rising to fill the late Bill Wilson's shoes, lending credibility to the [http://www.wtv-zone.com/Liandre/Liandres/400_AA_Slogans.html slogan] that says &quot;principles before personalities&quot;
* According to the BB, &quot;Our primary purpose is to stay sober and to help others to achieve sobriety.&quot;  Thus, AA is not a social movement and is not involved in trying to reshape society or to affect communities or their values.  AA prefers to appeal to potential members through &quot;attraction rather than promotion.&quot;

===AA's Critics===

Specific criticisms sometimes put forth by AA's critics (some of whom go so far as to call AA a [[cult]]) include:
* There have been at least three randomized clinical trials that studied the effectiveness of AA.  Specifically: Ditman et al. 1967; Brandsma et al. 1980; Walsh et al. 1991.
**Dr. Ditman found that participation in A.A. increased the alcoholics' rate of rearrest for public drunkeness.[1]
**Dr. Brandsma found that A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking. After several months of indoctrination with A.A. 12-Step dogma, the alcoholics in A.A. were doing five times as much binge drinking as a control group that got no treatment at all, and nine times as much binge drinking as another group that got Rational Behavior Therapy. Brandsma alleges that teaching people that they are alcoholics who are powerless over alcohol yields very bad results and that it becomes a self-fulfilling prediction -- they relapse and binge drink as if they really were powerless over alcohol.[2]
**And Dr. Walsh found that the so-called &quot;free&quot; A.A. program was actually very expensive -- it messed up patients so that they required longer periods of costly hospitalization later on.[3]
* While AA acknowledged in the foreword to the second edition of the Big Book that &quot;we surely have no monopoly&quot;, one of the stories following the main text of the book still claims that AA is &quot;the ''only'' remedy&quot; to alcohol abuse (BB, pg. 259. Emphasis added.), despite some current research which shows that high percentages of alcohol abusers recover without medical treatment (''Treatment of Drug Abuse and Addiction -- Part III'', The Harvard Mental Health Letter, Volume 12, Number 4, October 1995, page 3.).  Another study suggests that AA may be &quot;no better than the natural history of the disease&quot; in keeping people alive and sober (''The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and Paths to Recovery'', George E. Vaillant, pgs. 283-286.)
* The claim that people who refuse to work the program thoroughly, or do but are not helped by it, are &quot;constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves&quot; (BB, pg. 58.), implies that, by definition, the AA program itself is incapable of failure, provided that the alcoholic is properly motivated.  This seems to deny the existence of honest, motivated individuals for whom the program doesn't work.  (&quot;consitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves&quot; has nothing to do with motivation and everything to do with being thorough through the steps and when the truth gets to be too much, backing down and not trudging through the rough spots.)
* A lack of official checks and balances designed to keep sponsors from abusing their position (though sponsors can be fired at any time)
* Claims that alcoholics are &quot;doomed to an alcoholic death&quot; unless they decide to &quot;live on a spiritual basis&quot; (each AA member being allowed to decide for himself what &quot;spiritual basis&quot; means) (BB, pg 44) and &quot;Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our suggested Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his own death warrant.&quot; (12x12, pg. 174).
* In the discussion of self-centeredness, statements such as &quot;Sometimes they [other people] hurt us, seemingly without provocation, but we ''invariably'' find that at some point in the past we have made decisions based on self which later placed us in a position to be hurt.&quot; (BB, pg. 62. Emphasis added.) may be generalized so as to leave no room for instances where the victim was blameless, such as [[child sexual abuse|childhood sexual abuse]] or another form of mistreatment of either children or innocent adults unable to protect themselves. Many AA members interpret this to mean that blameless victims are at fault for continuing to be hurt by a past event, and not at fault for the past event itself. Some critics assert that this interpretation is incompatible with the text, saying that it clearly refers to the actual acts of others, not the victims' attitudes towards those acts, and suggests the problems of victims are that they have made &quot;decisions based on self&quot;, that, ''later'' place them in a position to be hurt, not that they have chosen to remain affected by earlier hurts. On the other hand, supporters assert that the &quot;decisions based on self&quot; could have been, and in the case of blameless victims, clearly were, made ''after'' the event itself that occurred.  An unofficial slogan sometimes heard in AA is &quot;There are no victims, only volunteers.&quot; This clearly indicates the belief that nobody is ever victimised in any way that they could not have avoided. (Some AA members believe that these types of statements are only intended to warn against a habitual victim mentality. Some AA members understand that people can experience either innocent bad luck or be seriously victimized through no fault of their own.) In any case, the interpretation suggests that whether one continues to be hurt by previous abuse is something one can have full choice over, whereas physical and mental trauma resulting from victimisation might be chronic and something the victim is ''truly'' powerless over.
* The claim that &quot;If we were to live, we had to be free of anger.&quot; (BB, pg. 66) when psychologists say that while anger must be [[Anger management|managed]], it is not possible or healthy to do away with it entirely.   (Some AA members interpret &quot;free of anger&quot; to mean that one should not be enslaved by their anger, be a &quot;rageaholic,&quot; or engage in habitual toxic anger, not to mean that they should have no anger at all.)
* The &quot;To Wives&quot; chapter of the Big Book being written as advice from one wife of an alcoholic to another, when it was in fact written by Bill W. himself despite his wife Lois' desire to write it (''Getting Better: Inside Alcoholics Anonymous'', Nan Robertson, page 70-71; ''Pass It On'', a publication of AA, page 200.)
* Bill W.'s frequent use of first-person plural giving the implication that all alcohol abusers have similar defects of character ([[12 steps#The twelve steps|6th Step]]) and past experiences (examples: &quot;...something had to be done about ''our'' vengeful resentments, self-pity, and unwarranted pride.&quot; 12x12, pg. 47. and &quot;''We'' never thought of making honesty, tolerance, and true love of man and [[god]] the daily basis of living.&quot; 12x12, pg. 72. Emphasis added.)
* The contradiction between the BB's claim that &quot;We will seldom be interested in liquor. &quot;If tempted, we recoil from it as from a hot flame&quot; We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given to us without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes! That is the [[miracle]] of it.&quot; (BB, pgs. 84-85) and Bill W.'s own statement that even co-founder Dr. Bob &quot;was bothered very badly by the temptation to drink.&quot; &quot;Unlike most of our crowd, I did not get over my craving for liquor much during the first two and one half years of abstinence.&quot; [&quot;Dr. Bob's Nightmare&quot;] (BB page 181)  On the other hand, Dr. Bob's use of the word &quot;craving&quot; is consistent with the physical cravings described by Dr. Silkworth, not with the lack of the mental obsession to ''return'' to liquor that is described.
* AA's heavy reliance on [http://www.wtv-zone.com/Liandre/Liandres/400_AA_Slogans.html numerous slogans] [http://www.recoveryresources.org/aphorisms.html] [http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/Spa/2973/index11.html], including ones used to defer criticisms brought up during meetings, such as &quot;Take the cotton out of your ears and put it in your mouth!&quot;

====Criticisms specific to religious themes====

Critics see the following points as evidence of religious themes in AA:

* Many of the steps being adapted and altered from tenets that &quot;came straight from Dr. Bob's and (Bill W.'s) own earlier association with the [[Oxford Group]]s&quot; (''The Language of the Heart'', William G. Wilson, pg. 298), a Christian spiritual movement with which friends of theirs had been involved and which places a large emphasis on taking individual responsibility for the harm one has done to others and confession to god and another person.
* Because &quot;most alcoholics just wanted to find sobriety, nothing else&quot;, &quot;The [[Oxford Group]]s' absolute concepts ... had to be fed with teaspoons rather than by buckets.&quot; (''Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age'', William G. Wilson, pgs. 74-75.)
* The statement that &quot;At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order. But this is not an end in itself. Our real purpose is to fit ourselves to be of maximum service to [[god]]&quot; (&quot;god&quot; or &quot;higher power&quot; being defined by the AA member himself, including non-spiritual, agnostic, or atheist beliefs) (BB, pg. 77)
* &quot;Being entirely ready to have god remove these defects of character&quot; ([[12 steps#The twelve steps|sixth step]]), &quot;or, if you wish, our [[sin]]s&quot; (12x12, pg. 48), and &quot;[[pray]]ing only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out&quot; ([[12 steps#The twelve steps|eleventh step]])

====Criticism of religious themes from religious groups====
Several [[Traditionalist Catholics]] have expressed misgivings about what they term &quot;the abominably liberal and indifferentist,&quot; nature of AA while at the same time acknowledging it should be cautiously tolerated to avoid the greater evil of alcoholism.[http://www.sspx.ca/Angelus/2002_September/Traditional_Catholic.htm] A small number of ultra-conservative Protestants have expressed discomfort about what they believe to be [[New Thought]], [[Society of Jesus|Jesuitic]], or even [[occult]] aspects to [[Bill W]]'s personal philosophy.

In [[computer graphics]], '''alpha compositing''' is often useful to render
image elements in separate passes, and then combine the resulting 
multiple 2D images into a single, final image in a process called 
compositing. For example, compositing is used extensively when combining 
computer rendered image elements with live footage.

In order to correctly combine these image elements, it is necessary to
keep, for each element, an associated ''matte''. This matte contains
the coverage information - the shape of the geometry being drawn - and 
allows us to distinguish between parts of the image where the geometry 
was actually drawn and other parts of the image which are empty.

To store this matte information, the concept of an '''alpha channel'''
was introduced by A.R.Smith in the late 1970s, and fully developed 
in the 1984 paper ''Compositing Digital Images'', by
Thomas Porter and Tom Duff. In a 2D image element which stores a color
for each pixel, an additional value is stored in the alpha channel
containing a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means that the pixel
does not have any coverage information; i.e. there was no color
contribution from any geometry because the geometry did not overlap
this pixel. A value of 1 means that the pixel is fully opaque because
the geometry completely overlapped the pixel.

If an alpha channel is used in an image, it is common to also multiply
the color by the alpha value, in order to save on additional
multiplications during the compositing process. This is usually
referred to as ''premultiplied alpha''. Thus, assuming that the pixel
color is expressed using [[RGB_color_space|RGB]] triples, a pixel value
of (0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5) implies a pixel which is fully green and has
50% coverage.

With the existence of an alpha channel, it is then easy to express
useful compositing image operations, using a ''compositing algebra'' 
defined in the Duff and Porter paper. For example, given two image
elements A and B, the most common compositing operation is to combine the
images such that A appears in the foreground and B appears in the
background; this can be expressed as A '''over''' B. In addition to
'''over''', Porter and Duff defined the compositing operators '''in''',
'''out''', '''atop''', and '''xor''' (and the reverse operators
'''rover''', '''rin''', '''rout''', and '''ratop''')
from a consideration of choices in blending the colors of two
pixels when their coverage is, conceptually, overlaid orthogonally:

[[Image:Alpha_compositing.jpg]]

The '''over''' operator is, in effect, the normal painting
operation (see [[Painter's algorithm]]). The '''in''' operator is the alpha compositing equivalent of clipping.

As an example, the '''over''' operator can be
accomplished by applying the following formula to each pixel value:

:&lt;math&gt;C_o = C_a + C_b \times \left(1 - \alpha_a\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_o = \alpha_a + \alpha_b \times \left(1 - \alpha_a\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where C&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the result of the operation, C&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the
color of the pixel in element A, C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is the color of the
pixel in element B, and &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; are the alpha of the pixels in elements A and B respectively. This assumes that the pixel colors of each element have already been premultiplied by alpha.

Alpha compositing on images can be done in several high-end graphics programs, including [[Adobe Photoshop]] and [[Paint Shop Pro]], and free software programs like [[GIMP]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[computer programming]], an '''array''', also known as a ''vector'' or ''list'' (for one-dimensional arrays) or a ''matrix'' (for two-dimensional arrays), is one of the simplest [[data structure]]s. Arrays hold a series of data [[element (mathematics)|element]]s, usually of the same size and [[data type]]. Individual elements are accessed by their position in the array. The position is given by an [[index (information technology)|index]], which is also called a subscript. The index usually uses a consecutive range of [[integer]]s, (as opposed to an [[associative array]]) but the index can have any [[ordinal numbers |ordinal]] set of values. Some arrays are ''multi-dimensional'', meaning they are indexed by a fixed number of integers, for example by a [[tuple]] of four integers. Generally, one- and two-dimensional arrays are the most common.

Most [[programming language]]s have arrays as a built-in data type.  Some programming languages (such as [[APL programming language|APL]], some versions of [[Fortran]], and [[J programming language|J]]) generalize the available operations and functions to work transparently over arrays as well as scalars, providing a higher-level manipulation than most other languages, which require loops over all the individual members of the arrays.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Arrays permit efficient (constant-time, [[Big O notation|O]](1)) [[random access]] but not efficient insertion and deletion of elements (which are O(''n''), where ''n'' is the size of the array). [[Linked list]]s have the opposite trade-off. Consequently, arrays are most appropriate for storing a fixed amount of data which will be accessed in an unpredictable fashion, and linked lists are best for a list of data which will be accessed sequentially and updated often with insertions or deletions.

Another advantage of arrays that has become very important on modern architectures is that iterating through an array has good [[locality of reference]], and so is much faster than iterating through (say) a linked list of the same size, which tends to jump around in memory. However, an array can also be accessed in a random way, as is done with large [[hash table]]s, and in this case this is not a benefit.

Arrays also are among the most compact data structures; storing 100 integers in an array takes only 100 times the space required to store an integer, plus perhaps a few bytes of overhead for the whole array. Any [[pointer]]-based data structure, on the other hand, must keep its pointers somewhere, and these occupy additional space. This extra space becomes more significant as the data elements become smaller.  For example, an array of [[ASCII]] [[character (computing)|character]]s takes up one byte per character, while on a 32-bit platform, which has 4-byte pointers, a linked list requires at least five bytes per character.  Conversely, for very large elements, the space difference becomes a negligible fraction of the total space.

Because arrays have a fixed size, there are some indexes which refer to invalid elements &amp;mdash; for example, the index 17 in an array of size 5. What happens when a program attempts to refer to these varies from language to language and platform to platform. For more information, see [[bounds checking]].

==Uses==
Although useful in their own right, arrays also form the basis for several more complex data structures, such as [[heap (data structure)|heap]]s, [[hash table]]s, and [[VList]]s, and can be used to represent [[String (computer science)|string]]s, [[Stack (computing)|stack]]s and [[queue]]s. They also play a more minor role in many other data structures. All of these applications benefit from the compactness and locality of arrays.

One of the disadvantages of an array is that it has a single fixed size, and although its size can be altered in many environments, this is an expensive operation. [[Dynamic array]]s or ''growable arrays'' are arrays which automatically perform this resizing as late as possible, when the programmer attempts to add an element to the end of the array and there is no more space. To average the high cost of resizing over a long period of time (we say it is an [[amortized analysis|amortized cost]]), they expand by a large amount, and when the programmer attempts to expand the array again, it just uses more of this reserved space.

In the [[C programming language]], one-dimensional [[character (computing)|character]] arrays are used to store null-terminated strings, so called because the end of the string is indicated with a special reserved character called a [[null character]] ('\0') (see also [[C string]]).

Finally, in some applications where the data are the same or are missing for most values of the indexes, or for large ranges of indexes, space is saved by not storing an array at all, but having an [[associative array]] with integer keys. There are many specialized data structures specifically for this purpose, such as [[Patricia trie]]s and [[Judy array]]s. Example applications include [[virtual memory|address translation table]]s and [[routing table]]s.

==Indices into arrays==
Although abstractions for arrays in most programming languages are very similar, one strong point of contention has arisen: the index used to refer to the first element. There are three main solutions: ''zero-based'', ''one-based'', and ''n-based'' arrays, for which the first element has index zero, one, or a programmer-specified value, respectively.

This is mainly a stylistic concern. The zero-based array was made popular by the [[C programming language]], in which the abstraction of ''array'' is very weak, and an index ''n'' of an array is simply the address of the first element offset by ''n'' units. Accordingly, index 0 points to the first element of the array. Descendants of C inherit this behavior. One-based arrays, are based on traditional mathematics notation and simple counting, which begins with one. The last group - ''n-based'' - has been made available so the programmer is free to chose the lower bound which is best suited for the problem at hand.

There is a [[Array#Array_system_cross_reference_list|list of programming languages]] at the end of the article.

The conflict over the &quot;right&quot; way to do array indexing has impacted programmer culture. When supporters of one-based arrays decried zero-based arrays as unnatural, saying for example that we start numbered lists from 1, supporters of zero-based arrays retaliated by starting their own lists from zero in their daily lives. This practice can still be observed, and is often done for humor.

Another reason to prefer zero-based arrays is the so-called &quot;century confusion phenomenon&quot;. In the year 2000, most people in the world believed they were celebrating either the beginning of the 21st century, or the end of the 20th century. In fact, they were celebrating neither, because only 1,999 years had passed on the anno domini scale. The 21st century did not begin until 2001, due to the fact that the AD system is one-based. This is perhaps the greatest example of an inferior indexing scheme causing mass confusion of some 6 billion people.

Supporters of ''zero-based'' indexing often criticise ''one-based'' and ''n-based'' arrays for being slower. While this is true, a ''one-based'' or ''n-based'' array access can be easily optimized &amp;mdash; with [[common subexpression elimination]] or the use of a well-defined [[dope vector]], to name only two options available. So in real-life applications ''one-based'' and ''n-based'' arrays are just as fast as ''zero-based'' arrays.

==Multi-dimensional arrays==
Ordinary arrays are indexed by a single integer. Also useful, particularly in numerical and graphics applications, is the concept of a ''multi-dimensional array'', in which we index into the array using an ordered list of integers, such as in ''a''[3,1,5]. The number of integers in the list used to index into it is always the same and is referred to as the array's ''dimensionality'', and the bounds on each of these are called the array's ''dimensions''. An array with dimensionality ''k'' is often called ''k''-dimensional. One-dimensional arrays correspond to the simple arrays discussed thus far; two-dimensional arrays are a particularly common representation for [[matrix (math)|matrices]]. In practice, the dimensionality of an array rarely exceeds three.

Mapping a one-dimensional array into memory is obvious, since memory is logically itself a (very large) one-dimensional array. When we reach higher-dimensional arrays, however, the problem is no longer obvious. Suppose we want to represent this simple two-dimensional array:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\
7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

A few common representations include:

* Row-major order. Used most notably by statically-declared arrays in [[C programming language|C]]. The elements of each row are stored in order.
{| border=1
|-
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8
| 9
|}

* Column-major order. Used most notably in [[Fortran]]. The elements of each column are stored in order.
{| border=1
|-
| 1 || 4 || 7 || 2 || 5 || 8 || 3 || 6
| 9
|}

* Arrays of arrays. Multi-dimensional arrays are represented by one-dimensional arrays of [[reference (computer science)|reference]]s ([[Iliffe vector]]s) to other one-dimensional arrays. The subarrays can be either the rows or columns.

[[Image: Array_of_array_storage.svg | 120px | A two-dimensional array stored as a one-dimensional array of one-dimensional arrays.]]

The first two forms are more compact and have potentially better locality of reference, but are also more limiting; the arrays must be ''rectangular'', meaning that no row can contain more elements than any other. Arrays of arrays, on the other hand, allow the creation of ''ragged arrays'', also called ''jagged arrays'', in which the valid range of one index depends on the value of another, or in this case, simply that different rows can be different sizes. Arrays of arrays are also of value in programming languages that only supply one-dimensional arrays as primitives.

In many applications, such as numerical applications working with [[matrix (math)|matrices]], we iterate over rectangular two-dimensional arrays in predictable ways. For example, computing an element of the matrix product '''AB''' involves iterating over a row of '''A''' and a column of '''B''' simultaneously. In mapping the individual array indexes into memory, we wish to exploit locality of reference as much as we can. A compiler can sometimes automatically choose the layout for an array so that sequentially accessed elements are stored sequentially in memory; in our example, it might choose row-major order for '''A''', and column-major order for '''B'''. Even more exotic orderings can be used, for example if we iterate over the [[main diagonal]] of a matrix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Advance Australia Fair''' is the official [[national anthem]] of [[Australia]]. It was composed by [[Peter Dodds McCormick]] in the late [[19th century]], and first performed by [[Andrew Fairfax]] at a [[Highland Society]] function in [[Sydney]] on St Andrew's Day, ([[30 November]], [[1878]]).  The song quickly gained popularity and an amended version was sung by a choir of 10,000 at the inauguration of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] in 1901. In 1907, the Australian Government awarded McCormick £100 for its composition.

It emerged as the most popular choice for the national anthem after an opinion poll in 1974 (the Australian Bureau of Statistics polled 60,000 nationally).  It was also the subject of a National Song Poll in 1977, where it garnered 43.6% of the vote, as against ''[[Waltzing Matilda]]'' (28.5%), the ''[[Song Of Australia]]'' (9.7%), and the then-current national anthem ''[[God Save the Queen]]'' (18.7%).

The anthem attracts occasional discussion in Australia, with allegations that both the tune and lyrics are mediocre, lacklustre or uninspiring.  Another compaint is that it is not as popular or well known as other national songs, particularly ''Waltzing Matilda''. In particular the word &quot;girt&quot; (the [[English passive voice|passive form]] of the [[verb]] &quot;to gird&quot;) meaning 'encircled' or 'surrounded' is criticised as obscure.

==Historical notes==
Before its adoption as Australia's national anthem, ''Advance Australia Fair'' saw considerable use elsewhere. For instance, during [[World War II]], Australia's national broadcaster, the [[Australian Broadcasting Commission]], used it to announce its news bulletins. It was also frequently played at the start or end of official functions.

It was adopted as the national anthem by a 1984 decision of the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of [[Bob Hawke]], although it required a proclamation by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] for the decision to become official.

==Alternatives==
Other tunes that have gained recognition in the popular mind as patriotic songs include the pop ballad ''[[I Still Call Australia Home]]'', by [[Peter Allen]] and the reggae-influenced rock song ''[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]'' by band [[Men At Work]].  Also gaining popularity is ''[[I Am Australian]]'' by [[Bruce Woodley]] (better known as a member of [[The Seekers]]).

As part of [[New Year's Eve]] [[2004]] celebrations, [[Clover Moore]], [[Lord Mayor]] of the [[City of Sydney]], commissioned a dance [[remix]] of ''Advance Australia Fair'' with a verse of [[Waltzing Matilda]] in it, receiving mixed reactions. A previous remix of the song, released in 2003 by comedian [[Adam Hills]], set the song lyrics to the music of [[Jimmy Barnes]]'s ''[[Working Class Man]]''.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of ''Advance Australia Fair'' express relatively uncontroversial Australian self-beliefs and aspirations.

For its adoption as the national anthem, the second, fourth, and fifth verses were dropped from the &quot;official&quot; version, as they emphasised the [[United Kingdom|British]] aspects of Australia's heritage, along with the virtues of Britain, and three lines were changed, in order to promote [[non-sexist language]] and to reflect the fact that Australia is no longer a 'youthful Commonwealth'. For example:
* the first line of the first verse: &quot;Australia's sons let us rejoice&quot; to &quot;Australians all let us rejoice&quot;.
* verse 3 (verse 2 of official version), line 3 : &quot;To make this youthful Commonwealth&quot; to &quot;To make this Commonwealth of ours&quot;.
* verse 3 (verse 2 of official version), line 5 : &quot;For loyal sons beyond the seas&quot; to &quot;For those who've come across the seas&quot;.

There lies some ambiguity in the enduring popularity of '''''[[Waltzing Matilda]]''''', which is often regarded as a much finer tune and has been part of the Australian imagination almost since its composition 110 years ago. Many non-Australians simply assume the tune is Australia's anthem.  However, Waltzing Matilda's lyrics, detailing the exploits of an itinerant who steals a sheep and then drowns himself in an effort to avoid capture by the police and the local [[squatter]] (land-owner), are regarded by some Australians as unsuitable as an expression of Australian values, and, indeed, as unsuitable topics for discussion in a national anthem. Nevertheless, its long-lasting popularity suggests that other Australians have a lingering sense of identification with the romantic figure of the [[swagman]], his precarious existence, his stubborn defiance of authority and his working-class status.

===''Advance Australia Fair'' - The official version===
:Australians all let us rejoice,
:For we are young and free;
:We've golden soil and wealth for toil,
:Our home is girt by sea;
:Our land abounds in Nature's gifts
:Of beauty rich and rare;
:In history's page, let every stage
:Advance Australia fair!
:In joyful strains then let us sing,
:&quot;Advance Australia fair!&quot;

:Beneath our radiant [[Crux|Southern Cross]],
:We'll toil with hearts and hands;
:To make this Commonwealth of ours
:Renowned of all the lands;
:For those who've come across the seas
:We've boundless plains to share;
:With courage let us all combine
:To advance Australia fair.
:In joyful strains then let us sing
:&quot;Advance Australia fair!&quot;

===Dodds' original lyrics===
:Australia's sons let us rejoice,
:For we are young and free;
:We've golden soil and wealth for toil,
:Our home is girt by sea;
:Our land abounds in Nature's gifts
:Of beauty rich and rare;
:In history's page, let every stage
:Advance Australia fair!
:In joyful strains then let us sing,
:&quot;Advance Australia fair!&quot;

:When gallant Cook from Albion sail'd,
:To trace wide oceans o'er,
:True British courage bore him on,
:Till he landed on our shore.
:Then here he raised Old England's flag,
:The standard of the brave;
:With all her faults we love her still,
:&quot;Britannia rules the wave!&quot;
:In joyful strains then let us sing
:&quot;Advance Australia fair!&quot;

:Beneath our radiant southern Cross,
:We'll toil with hearts and hands;
:To make this youthful Commonwealth
:Renowned of all the lands;
:For loyal sons beyond the seas
:We've boundless plains to share;
:With courage let us all combine
:To advance Australia fair.
:In joyful strains then let us sing
:&quot;Advance Australia fair!&quot;

:While other nations of the globe
:Behold us from afar,
:We'll rise to high renown and shine
:Like our glorious southern star;
:From England, Scotia, Erin's Isle,
:Who come our lot to share,
:Let all combine with heart and hand
:To advance Australia fair!
:In joyful strains then let us sing
:&quot;Advance Australia fair!&quot;

:Shou'd foreign foe e'er sight our coast,
:Or dare a foot to land,
:We'll rouse to arms like sires of yore
:To guard our native strand;
:Britannia then shall surely know,
:Beyond wide ocean's roll,
:Her sons in fair Australia's land
:Still keep a British soul.
:In joyful strains then let us sing
:&quot;Advance Australia fair!&quot;

===Version for religious occasions===
There is a version of the anthem that is only authorised for use on religious occasions. For instance, it was sung in a special service at St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney, on [[July 10]], [[2005]] with Prime Minister [[John Howard]] present. The lyrics are as follows:

:Australians all let us rejoice, for we are young and free;
:We've golden soil and wealth for toil, our home is girt by sea;
:Our land abounds in Nature's gifts of beauty rich and rare;
:In history's page, let every stage advance Australia fair!
:In joyful strains then let us sing advance Australia fair!

:Beneath our radiant southern Cross, we'll toil with hearts and hands; 
:To make this Commonwealth of ours, renowned of all the lands; 
:For those who've come across the seas, we've boundless plains to share; 
:With courage let us all combine, to advance Australia fair. 
:In joyful strains then let us sing Advance Australia fair! 

:With Christ our head and cornerstone, we'll build our nation's might
:Whose way and truth and light alone, can guide our path aright
:Our lives, a sacrifice of love reflect our Master's care,
:With faces turned to heaven above, advance Australia Fair.
:In joyful strains then let us sing, advance Australia Fair.

Some people think this was the original version, but it was not McCormick's own (see above). The third, explicitly Christian verse was written by an unknown author early in the 21st century.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''automatic number [[announcement]] circuit (ANAC)''' is a special [[telephone number]] that is meant to be used by [[phone company]] technicians and other telecommunications technicians to determine the phone number of a particular line.

The way an ANAC works is fairly simple: A technician will call a local ANAC's phone number (in Connecticut, they would dial 970). This number connects to a computer at a local [[central office]] which uses a voice synthesizer or digital samples to &quot;speak&quot; the phone number of the line calling in. The main purpose of this system is to allow phone company technicians to identify which telephone line they are connected to. Because this system is based on [[automatic number identification]] (not caller ID) and meant for phone company technicians, the ANAC system works with unlisted and even numbers with [[caller ID]] blocking.

Some ANACs are very regional or local in scope, while others are state or [[area code]]-wide. There appears to be no national cohesive system for them. Every telephone company (big or small) can determine its own ANAC for each individual central office, leading to a mish-mash of overlapping and/or spotty coverage. 

In most North American area codes, 958-xxxx and 959-xxxx exchanges are reserved for various local and long-distance test purposes (a few may also reserve 999-xxxx); ANAC numbers sometimes appear in the 958-xxxx range but there is no requirement that they reside there. Other local test numbers may include [[ringback]] (to test the ringer when installing telephones) and [[loop line]]s (which connect a call to another inbound call to the same or another test number). Some carriers (such as [[Bell Canada]]) have been known to program [[payphone]]s to disable calls to 958 or 959 test lines.

Some large telephone companies have toll-free numbers set-up, but these numbers remain undisclosed to prevent abusive use.

There are some private national toll-free numbers that use [[Automatic number identification|ANI]] and then have a computer read back the number that is calling, but these are not intended for use in identifying your phone number, they are used in order for you to confirm the phone you are calling from so that a computer can automatically pull up your account for the next available customer service representative. However, if one were to call up one of these numbers, listen for the number confirmation and hang up, they would in effect be using this system as if it were an ANAC.

:''&quot;Our records indicate you are calling from 555-555-5555, if this is correct, press 1, if it is not correct, press 2... CLICK&quot;''

==ANAC numbers==

For easier reference, the list is presented by area code. In some regions, there are several numbers depending on the telephone company and/or the area you are calling from as there can be several central offices serving some areas. All are local numbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[Amerigo Vespucci]]''' ([[March 9]], [[1454]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] - [[February 22]], [[1512]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] merchant and [[cartography|cartographer]] who voyaged to and wrote about [[the Americas]]. His exploratory journeys along the eastern coastline of [[South America]] convinced him that a new continent had been discovered, a bold contention in his day when everyone, including [[Christopher Columbus]], thought the seafaring trailblazers setting out from European docks were travelling to [[East Asia]]. 

[[image:Amerigo_Vespucci.jpg|thumb|200px|right| Amerigo Vespucci]]

Amerigo Vespucci was born in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], as the third child of a respected family. His father was a notary for the Money Changers' [[Guild]] of Florence. 

The role of Vespucci has been much debated, particularly due to two of his letters whose authenticity has been brought into doubt: the ''Mundus Novus'' ([[New World]]) and the ''Lettera'' (or &quot;The Four Voyages&quot;). While some have suggested that Vespucci was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications, others have instead proposed that the two letters were forgeries written by others of the same period.

It may have been the publication and widespread circulation of his letters that led [[Martin Waldseemüller]] to name the new continent [[The Americas|America]] on his world map of [[1507]]. Vespucci styled himself ''Americus Vespucius'' in his [[Latin]] writings, so Waldseemüller based the new name on the Latin form of Vespucci's first name, taking the feminine form ''America''. (See also [[Naming_of_America#Naming_of_America|Naming of America]].) ''Amerigo'' itself is an [[Italian language|Italian]] form of the medieval [[Latin]] ''Emericus'' (see also [[Emeric of Hungary (saint)|Saint Emeric of Hungary]]), which through the [[German language|German]] form [[Heinrich]] (in [[English language|English]], [[Henry]]) derived from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] name ''[[Haimirich]]''.

The two disputed letters claim that Vespucci made four voyages to America, while at most three can be verified from other sources. It is now generally accepted by historians that no voyage was made in [[1497]] (which allegedly began from [[Cádiz]] on [[May 10th]] of that year).

[[Image:Amerigo Vespucci01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Statue at the [[Uffizi]], Florence]]
In [[1499]]&amp;ndash;[[1500]], Vespucci joined an expedition led by [[Alonso de Ojeda]]. After hitting land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], the two seem to have separated. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] and reaching 6°S, before turning around and seeing [[Trinidad]] and the [[Orinoco River]] and returning to [[Spain]] by way of [[Hispaniola]]. Vespucci claimed, in a letter to Lorenzo di Medici, that he determined his longitude celestially on August 23, 1499, while on this voyage. But his claim is clearly fraudulent, which casts more doubt on Vespucci's credibility.

His next voyage in [[1501]]&amp;ndash;[[1502]] was in service of [[Portugal]], when he reached the bay of what is now [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The leader of this expedition was [[Gonçalo Coelho]]. On this voyage he sailed southward along the coast of [[South America]]. If his own account is to be believed, he reached the latitude of [[Patagonia]] before turning back; although this also seems doubtful, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the [[Río de la Plata]], which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south. During the first half of this expedition in [[1501]], Vespucci mapped the two [[star]]s, [[Alpha Centauri]] and [[Beta Centauri]] as well as the stars of the [[constellation]] [[Crux]]. Although these stars were known to the ancient [[Greece|Greeks]], gradual [[precession]] had lowered them below the [[Europe|European]] skyline so that they were forgotten.

Little is known of his last voyage in [[1503]]&amp;ndash;[[1504]]. It is not even known whether it actually took place. Amerigo Vespucci died in [[Seville]], [[Spain]], in [[1512]].

Vespucci's real importance for history may well not lie in his discoveries ''per se'', but in his letters, whether or not he wrote them all himself.  From these letters, the European public learned about America for the first time; its existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of their publication.

'''Aristide Maillol''' ([[April 8]] [[1861]], [[Banyuls-sur-Mer]], [[Roussillon]]&amp;mdash;[[September 27]] [[1944]], Banyuls-sur-Mer) was a [[France|French]] [[Catalans|Catalan]] [[Sculpture|sculptor]] and [[painter]].

He studied in [[Paris]], under renowned teacher [[Antoine Bourdelle]] and at the [[École des Beaux Arts]].

In the history of Modern art, Maillol's figurative stylization is perceived as an important precursor to the even greater simplifications of [[Henry Moore]] and [[Alberto Giacometti]]. But in the broader history of sculpture in the 20th century, he is known for a new kind of dream-like [[classicism]] that would set a standard for European (and [[United States|American]]) figure sculpture until the end of [[World War II]].

The paintings of his contemporaries [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]] and [[Paul Gauguin]] gave direction to his early work in [[tapestry]] at Banyuls and eventually his later career in sculpture, begun at age 40. 

He died in a car accident. While driving home during a rain shower, the car in which he was a passenger skidded off the road and overturned. Dina Vierny, Maillol's companion during the last 10 years of his life, established the Maillol Museum in [[Paris]].

      <comment>/* Notable works by Canova */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Antonio Canova''' ([[November 1]], [[1757]] - [[October 13]], [[1822]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[sculpture|sculptor]] who became famous for his [[marble sculpture]]s that delicately rendered [[nudity|nude]] flesh. The epitome of the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] sculptor, his work marked a return to [[classical]] refinement after the theatrical excesses of [[Baroque art]].

Canova was born in [[Possagno]] in the [[Province of Treviso]] where his family had for generations been [[stone cutter|stone cutter]]s; as a result and he learned to cut marble at a very early age. When only twelve years old he modelled a lion in butter, that was so liked by Signor Falieri that he sent him to be taught by Torretti, the most noted sculptor of the time. He studied ancient art and made many statues of classical subjects, as well as many monuments, busts and statues of living people, among them [[Napoleon]] and [[George Washington]]. The large fortune which he made was mostly spent in helping the poor, or in assisting other artists, he was made a [[nobleman]] and received many honors. 

Canova died in [[Venice]] aged sixty-five and was buried in the town of his birth. His heart was interred in a marble pyramid he designed as a [[mausoleum]] for the painter [[Titian]] in the church of [[Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari|Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] in Venice, now a monument to the sculptor.

Among Canova's pupils were the [[United Kingdom|British]] sculptors Sir [[Richard Westmacott]] and [[John Gibson (sculptor)|John Gibson]].

=== Notable works by Canova ===
* [[The Three Graces]]
* [[Cupid and Psyche]]
* [[Cupid and Psyche with Butterfly]]
* [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Adonis]]
* [[Daedalus]] and [[Icarus (mythology)|Icarus]]
* [[Perseus (mythology)|Perseus]] slays [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]]
* [[Hebe]] (1816), [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] and [[Forlì]]


Canova often executed more than one copy of a successful sculpture; there are for example four versions of [[Hebe]] (the last of them is in the Museum of [[Forlì]] [http://www.comune.forli.fo.it/cultura/musei1.asp], in [[Italy]]) two copies of [[The Three Graces]] and two of [[Cupid and Psyche]].

'''Auguste Rodin''' ([[November 12]], [[1840]] &amp;ndash; [[November 17]], [[1917]]) was a [[France|French]] [[Sculpture|sculptor]].

Born '''François-Auguste-René Rodin''', to a working class family in Paris, he is often given a pivotal role in the history of modern  [[sculpture]], as 
both excelling at and rebelling from the [[Beaux-arts]] tradition. His unique, virtuoso ability to organize a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface set him apart from the figure sculpture traditions before and since his time.

Despite the talent evident in his portrait of the local priest who helped him discover his vocation, Rodin was denied admission to the Beaux Arts academy. He was accepted, however, at a trade school for decorative sculpture, and later moved to Belgium to work in a studio that produced that kind of work.

One of his early works, ''The Age of Bronze'', created during his years in Belgium, looked so realistic that the sculptor was accused of ''[[surmoulage]]'' (taking plaster moulds from the live model).

Rodin struggled to clear his name and in 1880 was awarded the commission to create a portal for the planned Museum of Decorative Arts. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked for 37 years on this monumental sculptural group, ''[[The Gates of Hell]]'', depicting scenes from [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'' in high relief.

Many of his best-known sculptures, like ''[[The Thinker]]'' (''Le Penseur'', originally titled ''The Poet''), representing the poet Dante), ''[[The Three Shades]]'' (''Les Trois Ombres''), and ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'' (''Le Baiser'') were designed as figures for this monumental landscape of eternal passion and punishment, and only later presented as works in their own right. Other well-known works derived from ''The Gates'' are: the ''Ugolino'' group, ''Fugitive Love'', ''The Falling Man'', ''The Sirens'', ''Fallen Caryatid Carrying her Stone'', ''Damned Women'', ''The Standing Fauness'', ''The Kneeling Fauness'', ''The Martyr'', ''She Who Once Was the Beautiful Helmetmaker's Wife'', ''Glaucus'', ''Polyphem''.

Through his method of ''[[marcottage]]'', he used the same sculptural elements time and time again, under different names and in different combinations.

Instead of copying traditional academic postures, Rodin preferred to work with amateur models, street performers, acrobats, strong men and dancers. In his [[atelier]], the models walked around freely while the sculptor made quick sketches in clay, which were later  fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and forged into bronze or marble. Rodin was fascinated by dance and spontaneous movement; his ''John the Baptist'' shows a walking preacher, displaying two phases of the same stride simultaneously.

Rodin's personal life has captured the attention of history almost as much as his sculpture.

In [[1883]], Rodin agreed to supervise [[Alfred Boucher]]'s sculpture course during his absence and so met the 18-year-old sculptress [[Camille Claudel]]. Rodin fell in love with his talented pupil, and Claudel recognized her chance to be tutored by the greatest sculptor talent of her time, who was just breaking through to fame. They became a creative and intimate couple. Claudel inspired Rodin as a model for many of his tragic love couples and assisted him during his work on another important commission, ''[[The Burghers of Calais]]'' (''Les Bourgeois de Calais'').
[[Image:Rodin study of Jean de Fiennes Figure 1884.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Rodin figure displayed near the Norton Simon Museum -Pasadena CA. {{3d_glasses}}]]

Although they shared an atelier at a small old castle (68 Boulevard d'Italie, Paris), Rodin refused to give up his ties with [[Rose Beuret]], his loyal companion during his years of poverty in Belgium and mother of their son [[Auguste-Eugène Beuret]], born [[January 18]], [[1866]]. He never fulfilled a contract with Claudel to give up all contact with other women, and marry her. After nearly 15 years, the couple parted. Claudel went her own artistic way, but found herself isolated. 

Rodin, commissioned to create a ''Monument to Victor Hugo'' in the 1890s, dealt extensively with the subject of ''artist and muse'', reflecting the various aspects of his stormy and complex relationship with Claudel in ''The Poet and Love'', ''The Genius and Pity'', ''The Sculptor and his Muse''.  Like many of Rodin's public commissions, the ''Mounument to Victor Hugo'' met resistance because it did not fit conventional expectations. The 1897 plaster model was finally cast in bronze in 1964.

His ''Monument to Balzac'', exhibited at the 1898 salon at the Champ des Mars showing the writer in his morning frock, was repudiated as well. After the frustrating experience, Rodin did not finish any public commissions. Instead, after 1903 he had his most successful works enlarged to monumental dimensions.

As France's best known artist, he had a large staff of pupils, craftsmen, and stone cutters working for him. He created a number of society portrait busts, especially for wealthy American collectors, and began presenting fragmentary sculptures, which in his opinion contained the essence of his artistic statement, like ''Meditation without Arms'', ''Iris, Messenger of the Gods'' or ''The Walking Man''.

During his last creative years, Rodin concentrated on small dance studies (ca. 1915), and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched in a loose way, without taking his pencil from the paper or his eyes from the model. An exhibition of these drawings in Weimar in 1906 caused the so-called Kessler scandal, and [[Harry Count Kessler]] was dismissed as curator of the Weimar Museum.

On [[January 29]], [[1917]], Rodin finally married Rose Beuret, who died two weeks later.

Auguste Rodin died on [[November 17]], [[1917]]. A cast of ''The Thinker'' was placed next to his tomb in [[Meudon, France|Meudon]], [[Île-de-France (région)|Île-de-France]].

==Legacy==

[[Image:Balzac Bust Rodin1892.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rodin's bust of [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]], bronze, ([[1891]]-[[1892]]), which he gave to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[1914]].]]

The [[Musée Rodin]] in [[Paris]] was founded to administer and exhibit the huge body of work (over 5,000 plaster items, over 1,000 bronze sculptures, ca. 8,000 drawings, and as many photographs) Rodin left to the French government by several deeds of donation, shortly before his death. A part of this collection is shown at Hôtel Biron, much of it displayed in an outdoor garden. The most of plaster collection is kept at Villa des Brillants in Meudon, a suburb of Paris, where Rodin lived and worked during the last decades of his life.

With his works, Rodin also transferred the rights of reproduction to the Musée Rodin. According to French Law (Decree Nr. 81.255 of [[3 March]] [[1981]]), only 12 copies of each work can be issued as an ''original'' edition. Although the copyrights to Rodin's work expired in 1981 (50 years after the artist's death considering that every year during the 2 WW periods counts double), according to French law the Musée Rodin still exerts the ''droit moral'' (moral right), to prevent damage to the artist's good name by copies of inferior quality.

One of Rodin's 1889 sculptures was used by the rock band [[Black Sabbath]] as the cover art for their 1987 album of the same name, ''[[The Eternal Idol]]''.

'''Ann Arbor''' is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]]. As of the [[United States 2000 Census|2000 census]], the city had a total population of 114,024, not including approximately 42,000 college students with permanent residences elsewhere.{{ref|population}} Supposedly named for the spouses of the city's founders and for the stands of trees in the area, Ann Arbor is best known as the location of the main campus of the [[University of Michigan]], which moved there from [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] in 1837. 

The city's economy, which once centered on the production of agricultural implements, carriages, furniture, pianos and organs, pottery and flour, is now dominated by education, [[high tech]], and [[biotechnology]]. Average home prices and property taxes are well above the state and national medians. The city is also well known locally as a destination for dining out and entertainment, as it contains a wide and eclectic variety of restaurants and performance venues.

==History==
{{main|History of Ann Arbor, Michigan}}
Ann Arbor was founded in January 1824 by [[John Allen (founder)|John Allen]] and [[Elisha Rumsey]], both of whom were land speculators. There are various accounts concerning the origin of the settlement's name, but one states that Allen and Rumsey decided to name it &quot;Annarbour,&quot; for their spouses, whose names were both Ann, and for the stands of burr [[oak]] in the 640 [[acre]]s (260 [[hectare]]s) of land they had purchased for [[United States dollar|$]]800 from the federal government. The [[Native Americans (U.S.)|Native Americans]] of the region knew the settlement as ''Kaw-goosh-kaw-nick'', after the sound of Allen's grist mill.

Ann Arbor later became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827, and was incorporated as a village in 1833. The town set aside 40 acres (16 hectares) of undeveloped land and offered it to the State of Michigan as the site of the state capitol, but it lost the bid to [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] in 1836. In 1837 the unused land was sold to the [[University of Michigan]], forever linking Ann Arbor and its history with the university. The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the [[Michigan Central Railroad]]. Ann Arbor was chartered as a city in 1851.

During [[World War II]], [[Ford Motor Company]]'s nearby [[Willow Run]] plant turned out [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers. The population of Ann Arbor exploded with an influx of military personnel, war workers, and their families. 

The city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics over the course of the 1960s and 1970s. Presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] unveiled his [[Peace Corps]] proposal in 1960 at the University of Michigan, and in 1964 President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] first called for a &quot;[[Great Society]].&quot; The city also became a locus for [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] activism, serving as a hub for the [[American civil rights movement|civil-rights movement]], the [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], and the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group [[Students for a Democratic Society]] took place in Ann Arbor in 1960, and in 1965 the city was home to the first U.S. [[teach-in]] against the [[Vietnam War]]. Over the course of the ensuing fifteen years, a plethora of [[counterculture|countercultural]] and [[New Left]] enterprises sprang up and developed strong constituencies within the city.

These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the local, progressive [[Human Rights Party]] (HRP) won city-council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives successfully fought for measures ranging from pioneering [[civil rights|antidiscrimination]] ordinances to [[Marijuana laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan|measures decriminalizing marijuana possession]] to a [[rent control|rent-control]] ordinance – many of which remain in effect in modified form today.

Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small handful of conservative institutions were also born in Ann Arbor. These include [[Word of God (movement)|Word of God]] (established in 1967), a charismatic Catholic movement of national scope; and the [[Thomas More Law Center]] (established in 1999), a leading religious-conservative advocacy group.

The economy of Ann Arbor underwent a gradual shift from a manufacturing base to a service and technology base over the course of the 20th century, a shift which accelerated in the 1970s and 1980s. At the same time, the downtown has transformed from one dominated primarily by retail establishments dealing in staple goods to one comprised mainly of eateries, cafés, bars and clubs, and specialty shops.

Over the past several decades, the city has increasingly found itself grappling with the effects of sharply rising land values and [[gentrification]], as well as [[urban sprawl]] stretching far into the outlying countryside. On [[November 2]], [[2004]], voters approved a [[Greenbelt|greenbelt]] plan under which the city government would buy up the development rights to large swaths of land adjacent to Ann Arbor in order to prevent sprawling development. Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on whether, and how, to accommodate and guide development within city limits.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:NicholsArb.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Thanks to a reforestation campaign beginning in the early 20th century, Ann Arbor has many trees.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 27.7&amp;nbsp;[[square mile|mi&amp;sup2;]] (71.7&amp;nbsp;[[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]]); 27.0&amp;nbsp;mi&amp;sup2; (70.0&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2;) of it is land and 0.7 mi&amp;sup2; (1.7&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2;) of it is water.  The total area is 2.42% water, much of it being part of the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]]. Ann Arbor is approximately 40&amp;nbsp;[[mile]]s (64&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) west of [[Detroit]], a 45-minute car ride on [[Interstate 94|I-94]]. [[Ann Arbor Charter Township, Michigan|Ann Arbor Charter Township]] is adjacent, on the city's north and east sides.

Ann Arbor is situated on the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]], in a productive agricultural and fruit-growing region. The landscape of Ann Arbor consists of rolling hills and [[valley]]s, with the terrain becoming steeper near the Huron River and more level elsewhere. The elevation ranges from about 750&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (230&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]]) along the Huron River to about 900&amp;nbsp;feet (275&amp;nbsp;m) above sea level in southern and northeastern Ann Arbor.{{ref|terrain}} The elevation is about 839&amp;nbsp;feet (256&amp;nbsp;m) at Ann Arbor Municipal Airport, which is located at {{coor dm|42|13.38|N|83|44.74|W|region:US}}.

===Cityscape===
Ann Arbor's &quot;Tree Town&quot; moniker stems from the dense forestation of its parks and residential areas. The city holds almost as many trees as residents, with more than 50,000 trees sited along city streets and an equal number in city parks.{{ref|trees}} In recent years, the [[emerald ash borer]] has destroyed many of the city’s approximately 10,500 [[ash tree]]s.

The city contains 147 municipal parks, ranging from neighborhood vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas, with several large city parks and a university park bordering sections of the Huron River. The largest are Argo Park, Riverside Park, County Farm Park, and Gallup Park (near the Huron Parkway), while Fuller Recreation Area, near the [[University of Michigan Health System|University Hospital]] complex, contains sports fields, pedestrian and [[bike path]]s, and swimming pools. [[Nichols Arboretum]], which is jointly owned by the City of Ann Arbor and the [[University of Michigan]] (and known locally as &quot;The Arboretum&quot; or just &quot;The Arb&quot;), is a 123-acre (50 hectare) preserve on the east side of the city near downtown. It contains hundreds of plant and tree species and was expressly left to the city and the university for the benefit of the people of Ann Arbor and the children of Ann Arbor's public schools.

The Kerrytown Shops, Main Street Business District, the State Street Business District, and the South University Business District are commercial areas in downtown. Three commercial areas south of downtown include the areas near [[Interstate 94|I-94]] and Ann Arbor-Saline Road, Briarwood Mall, and the South Industrial area. Other commercial areas include the Arborland/Washtenaw Avenue and Packard Road merchants on the east side, the Plymouth Road area in the northeast, and the Westgate/West Stadium areas on the west side. The downtown contains a mix of 19th and early 20th-century structures and modern-style buildings, as well as a [[farmers' market]] in the Kerrytown district. The city’s commercial districts are mostly comprised of two to four-story structures, although the downtown and the area near Briarwood Mall contain a small number of high-rise buildings.

Ann Arbor's residential neighborhoods contain a range of architectural styles, from classic 19th and early 20th-century designs to [[ranch-style house]]s. More contemporary-style houses are located farther from the downtown district. Surrounding the University of Michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters. The 19th-century buildings and streetscape of the Old West Side neighborhood have been preserved virtually intact; in 1972, the district was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and it is further protected via city ordinances and a nonprofit preservation group.

===Climate===
Ann Arbor has a typically [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] [[temperate]] seasonal climate, which is influenced by the [[Great Lakes]]. There are four seasons, with winters being cold with moderate [[snowfall]] while summers can be warm and humid. The area does experience [[lake effect]] primarily in the form of increased cloudiness during late fall and early winter.{{ref|weather1}} The highest average temperature is in July at 83&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;[[fahrenheit|F]] (28&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;[[celsius|C]]) while the lowest average temperature is in January at 16&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;F (&amp;minus;9&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C). However, summer temperatures can top 90&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;F (32&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C), and winter temperatures can drop below 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;F (&amp;minus;17&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C). Average monthly precipitation ranges from 2 to 4&amp;nbsp;[[inch|inches]] (44 to 92&amp;nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]]), with the heaviest occurring during the summer months. Snowfall, which normally occurs from November to April, ranges from 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;inches (3 to 25&amp;nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]]) per month.{{ref|weather}} The highest recorded temperature was 105&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;F (40.6&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C) on [[July 24]], [[1934]], while the lowest recorded temperature was &amp;minus;22.0&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;F (&amp;minus;30&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C) on [[January 19]], [[1994]].{{ref|weather2}}

==Government and politics==
[[Image:AACityHall.JPG|thumb|200px|The Guy C. Larcom, Jr. Municipal Building houses the city hall and police station]]
Ann Arbor has a [[mayor]]-[[city council|council]] form of government. The mayor, who is elected every even-numbered year, is the presiding officer of the City Council and has the power to appoint all Council committee members as well as board and commission members, with the approval of the City Council. The City Council has ten members, two from each of the city's five wards, with the mayor wielding the tie-breaking vote. Council members serve two-year terms, with half the council elected in annual elections. 

Ann Arbor is located in the 15th Congressional district, and is represented by Representative [[John Dingell]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]), the longest-serving member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]]. On the state level, the city is in the 18th district in the [[Michigan Senate]]. In the [[Michigan State House of Representatives]], the city of Ann Arbor is in the 53rd district, while northeastern Ann Arbor and Ann Arbor Township are in the 52nd district. As the seat of [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]], the city is the location of the county's trial, civil, and criminal courts. Ann Arbor is also the site of a [[United States district court]], whose downtown building also houses a [[post office]].

[[Left-wing politics]] have been particularly strong in municipal government since the 1960s – an orientation evident in the passage of [[rent control|rent-control]] and strong [[civil rights|antidiscrimination]] ordinances, as well as voter-approved charter amendments that have [[Marijuana laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan|lessened the penalties]] for possession of marijuana (1974) and that aim to protect access to [[abortion]] in the city should it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan (1990). In 1974, [[Kathy Kozachenko|Kathy Kozachenko's]] victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country's first openly [[gay]] or [[lesbian]] candidate to win public office. In 1975, Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use [[instant-runoff voting]] for a mayoral race. Adopted through a ballot initiative sponsored by the local [[Human Rights Party]], which feared a splintering of the left/liberal vote, the process was repealed in 1976 after use in only one election. As of February 2006, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] hold the mayorship and all ten council seats.

Ann Arbor is the [[Town twinning|sister city]] to various municipalities around the world, including [[Tübingen]], [[Germany]] (since 1965); [[Belize City]], [[Belize]] (since 1967); [[Hikone]], [[Japan]] (since 1969); [[Peterborough, Ontario]], [[Canada]] (since 1983); [[Juigalpa]], [[Nicaragua]] (since 1986); and [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] (since 1997).

==Economy==
The University of Michigan plays a major role in shaping Ann Arbor's economy, both through its role as the city's largest employer (with approximately 15,000 workers plus an additional 6,000 at its medical center), and by attracting companies through its graduates and research and development work. Aside from education, [[high tech]], health services and [[biotechnology]] are major components of the city's economy, with numerous medical offices, laboratories, and associated companies located within the city. Companies associated with the [[automobile industry]], such as [[General Motors]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], also employ a large number of residents. Nevertheless, the city's economy remains relatively stable due to the major presence of the University of Michigan.

[[Image:AA Downtown.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Downtown Ann Arbor highrises]]
There are a number of high-tech companies located in the city. Ann Arbor Terminals, during the 1980s, was the manufacturer of the famous video-display terminal, the Ann Arbor Ambassador. Other high-tech companies in the area include Arbortext (provider of XML-based publishing software), Harris &amp; Baseview (provider of newspaper publishing software and ASP services), and [[ProQuest]], which includes [[UMI]].

Websites and online media companies located in the city include [[All Media Guide]], [[Everything2]], and the [[Weather Underground (weather service)|Weather Underground]]. Ann Arbor is also the site of the Michigan Information Technology Center (MITC), whose offices also house [[Internet2]] and the Merit Network, a nonprofit research and education computer network.

[[Pfizer]] operates a large pharmaceutical research facility on the northeast side of town. It was previously operated by Warner-Lambert and, before that, Parke-Davis. The city is the home of other research and engineering centers, including those of [[General Dynamics]] and the [[National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). Other research centers sited in the city are the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory and the [[Toyota|Toyota Technical Center]].  

Ann Arbor serves as the headquarters to several major companies. The original [[Borders Books]] was opened on Ann Arbor's State Street in 1971 by brothers Tom and Louis Borders, and began operating other outlets around the region beginning in 1985. The Borders chain is still based in the city, as is its flagship store (although not in its original location). A little-known fact is that dogs are allowed inside the flagship store, and the cashiers have a stock of doggy treats for canine visitors. [[Domino's Pizza]]'s headquarters are in Ann Arbor on Domino's Farms, a massive 271-acre (109 hectare) [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]-inspired complex in the northeastern portion of the city. Flint Ink Corp., another Ann Arbor-based company, was until recently the world's largest privately held ink manufacturer (in October 2005 it was acquired by Stuttgart-based XSYS Print Solutions). Another Ann Arbor-based company is [[Zingerman's|Zingerman's Delicatessen]], which serves sandwiches and Jewish foods, and has derived and developed a variety of businesses under different brand names.

Many [[cooperatives|cooperative]] enterprises were founded in the city during the 1960s and 1970s; among those that survive today are the [[People's Food Co-op, Ann Arbor|People's Food Co-op]] and the [[Inter-Cooperative Council at the University of Michigan]], a student-housing cooperative. The [[North American Students of Cooperation]] (NASCO) is an association of cooperatives, headquartered in Ann Arbor. There are also three [[Sunward Cohousing|cohousing]] communities located just outside the city limits to the west.

==Education==
[[image:Annarbor um law library.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Rackham School of Graduate Studies, University of Michigan]]
The [[University of Michigan]] is the dominant institution of higher learning in Ann Arbor, providing the city with a distinctly [[college town|college-town]] atmosphere. Much of the campus is adjacent to and intermixed with the city's downtown district. Because the campus and the city expanded side-by-side, there is often no firm divide between the two, with university buildings scattered through much of the city center.

Other colleges and universities located in the city are [[Cleary University]], a private business school; [[Concordia University, Ann Arbor|Concordia University]], a Lutheran liberal-arts institution; and [[Washtenaw Community College]]. [[Ave Maria School of Law]], a Catholic institution established by [[Domino's Pizza]] cofounder [[Tom Monaghan]], opened in northeastern Ann Arbor in 2000. There were plans to establish [[Ave Maria University]] on land occupied by Domino's Farms. However, due to conflicts with local zoning authorities, the new campus is under construction near [[Naples, Florida]].

The Ann Arbor Public School District – which enrolls a total of 16,885 students (2004/2005 September head count) – consists of twenty-one [[elementary school]]s, five [[middle school]]s, and five [[high school]]s (two traditional, Pioneer and Huron, as well as three alternative schools: [[Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan|Community High]], Stone School, and Roberto Clemente). The district operates an open school program out of Mack Elementary School, as well as a preschool and family center with programs starting as early as birth for at-risk infants and other programs for at-risk children before [[kindergarten]].

Due to overcrowding problems at the two traditional high schools, a third traditional high school is under construction.  Originally slated to open for the fall of 2006, the school's competion date and budget status is in jeopardy as of February 2006. Ann Arbor Public School officials are currently looking at other options for accomodating the district's students until the third high school is complete.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture in Ann Arbor, Michigan}}
[[Image:AnnArborMural.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mural outside a restaurant on Liberty Street. Further down the street (right of image) is the Borders bookstore.]]
Ann Arbor has a number of cultural attractions and events, many sponsored by the University of Michigan. Numerous performing arts groups and facilities are located on the university's campus, as are museums dedicated to [[art]], [[archaeology]], and natural history and sciences (''see [[Museums at the University of Michigan]]''). The [[Matthaei Botanical Gardens]], located on the northeastern edge of Ann Arbor, is operated by the university. Performing arts groups not associated with the university include the Ann Arbor Civic Theatre; the Arbor Opera Theater; the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra; the Ann Arbor Ballet Theater; the Ann Arbor Civic Ballet (established in 1954), which was Michigan's first chartered ballet company{{ref|dance}}; and Performance Network, which operates a downtown theater frequently offering new or nontraditional plays.

The [[Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum]], located in a historic downtown fire station, contains more than 250 interactive exhibits featuring science and technology. Artrain, located on North Main Street, bills itself as the nation's only traveling art museum on a train. A number of other art galleries exist in the city, notably in the downtown area and around the University of Michigan campus.

Near the State Street area are three major [[theater]]s: the [[Michigan Theater (Ann Arbor)|Michigan Theater]], a renovated 1920s movie palace now hosting live performances, independent films, and classic movies, and serving as home base for the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra; the State Theater; and the University of Michigan's [[Hill Auditorium]]. In the Main Street area, the [[Ark (folk venue)|Ark]] hosts folk and acoustic music, while a number of smaller venues and [[nightclub]]s serve up jazz and other live music. The Main Street area, as well as South State Street and South University Avenue, is also the center of a large restaurant scene in the city.

Among U.S. cities, Ann Arbor ranks first in the number of booksellers and books sold per capita.{{ref|books}} The Ann Arbor District Library has three branch outlets in addition to its main downtown building. The city is also home to the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library]].

Ann Arbor is known for college sports, notably at the University of Michigan, a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Several well-known college sports facilities exist in the city, including [[Michigan Stadium]] (whose seating capacity rivals the entire population of Ann Arbor), [[Crisler Arena]], and [[Yost Ice Arena]]. [[Concordia University, Ann Arbor, Michigan|Concordia University]], a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], also fields sports teams.

A person from Ann Arbor is called an &quot;Ann Arborite.&quot; The city itself is often called ''A&amp;sup2;'' (&quot;A-squared&quot;) or ''A2'' (&quot;A two&quot;), and less commonly ''Tree Town'' (or, usually [[tongue-in-cheek]], ''The People's Republic of Ann Arbor''). Recently, some youth have taken to calling Ann Arbor ''Ace Deuce'' or simply ''The Deuce''.

===Events===
A number of annual events – many of them centered on performing and visual arts – draw visitors to Ann Arbor from around the state and the region. The Ann Arbor Folk Festival, an annual [[benefit concert]] held in late January for the [[Ark (folk venue)|Ark]], features many folk musicians. The [[Ann Arbor Film Festival]] is held for six days in March at the [[Michigan Theater (Ann Arbor)|Michigan Theater]]. EdgeFest is a multi-venue festival of avant-garde and progressive jazz, held each autumn since 1997.

More unorthodox annual events include the [[Hash Bash]] and the Naked Mile. Held on the first Saturday of April since 1971, the Hash Bash is an event in support of the reform of [[marijuana]] laws. It includes speeches, live music, street vending, and occasional [[civil disobedience]]. Since 1986, the notorious Naked Mile has featured students [[Streaking|running naked]] through the streets in late April to celebrate the end of the winter semester. Originally police blocked off the streets to allow the run, but beginning in 2000, a crackdown by university and city police citing safety concerns has forced participants to adapt, with the event appearing in various reduced forms since.{{ref|nakedmile}}

Many large-scale events occur during the summer months. These include the Taste of Ann Arbor, a one-day event held during the first week of June in the downtown area; and the Ann Arbor Summer Festival, a three-and-a-half-week series of concerts, plays, and films typically held from mid-June through early July at the Power Center and atop the adjacent parking structure, which is host to the free &quot;Top of the Park&quot; events.

The Ann Arbor Art Fairs, a set of four concurrent juried fairs held on downtown streets, began in 1960. Scheduled on Wednesday through Saturday in the third week of July, the fairs draw upward of half a million visitors from across the nation. The oldest and most competitive of the four fairs is the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair.

Other summertime events include the Blues and Jazz Festival (established in 1969), which is usually held in mid-September at Gallup Park. The Dexter-Ann Arbor Run is a running race from [[Dexter, Michigan|Dexter]] to downtown Ann Arbor along the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]]. In late August the Shopping Cart Race, an unofficial and somewhat underground competition, has been held since 1998 as part of the annual [[Seize the Week, Ann Arbor, Michigan|Seize the Week]] series of events, known through 2004 as &quot;Punk Week&quot;.

===Media===
The ''Ann Arbor News'', owned by the Michigan-based [[Booth newspapers|Booth Newspapers]] chain, is the major daily newspaper serving Ann Arbor. Other established publications in the city include the ''Ann Arbor Observer'' – a monthly magazine with features covering local culture, politics, family life, business and history – along with the ''Current'', an entertainment guide, and the ''Ann Arbor Paper'', a free monthly with columns, fiction, humor, reviews, and profiles. The campus area is served by a variety of student publications, including the independent ''[[Michigan Daily]]''.

The three major Ann Arbor–based [[amplitude modulation|AM]] [[radio station]]s are [[WAAM]] 1600, a news and talk station; [[WLBY]] 1290, an [[Air America Radio]] affiliate; and [[WTKA]] 1050, which is primarily a sports station. The city's [[frequency modulation|FM]] stations include [[National Public Radio|NPR]] affiliate [[WUOM]] 91.7; country station [[WWWW]] 102.9; adult-alternative station [[WQKL]] 107.1; and [[WCBN]] 88.3, a noncommercial, student-run station with eclectic music and public-affairs programming. The city is also served by [[public broadcasting|public radio broadcasters]] in Ypsilanti, East Lansing, Detroit, and Toledo. [[CBC Radio One]] and [[CBC Radio Two]] affiliates from [[Windsor, Ontario]], can also be heard in Ann Arbor.

[[WPXD]] channel 31, an affiliate of the [[i (TV network)|i television network]], is licensed to the city. Community Television Network (CTN) is a city-provided cable television channel with production facilities open to city residents and nonprofit organizations. [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]-area radio and [[television station]]s also serve Ann Arbor.

==Infrastructure==
===Health and medicine===
The [[University of Michigan Health System|University of Michigan Medical Center]], the preeminent health facility in the city, is the world's largest university medical center and is considered one of the nation's best hospitals, taking the #11 slot in the 2005 ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' rankings. The University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) includes University Hospital, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital and Women's Hospital in its core complex. UMHS also operates out-patient clinics and facilities elsewhere in the city. The area's other major medical centers include a large facility operated by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] in Ann Arbor and Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital in nearby [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]].

===Transportation===
[[Image:AATA Bus.JPG|thumb|200px|An AATA bus, with the blue-roofed Blake Transit Center in the background.]]
The city is belted by three [[highway]]-grade roadways: [[Interstate 94|I-94]] (which runs along the southern portion of the city), [[U.S. Highway 23|US 23]] (which primarily runs along the eastern edge of Ann Arbor), and [[Michigan State Highway 14|M-14]] (which runs along the northern edge of the city).

The streets in downtown Ann Arbor conform to a grid pattern, though this pattern is less apparent in the surrounding areas. Several major roads branch out from the downtown district like spokes on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. Some of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 juncture in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas. Also, a large and expanding network of [[bike path]]s crisscrosses the city.

The [[Ann Arbor Transportation Authority]] (AATA), which brands itself as &quot;The Ride,&quot; operates public [[bus]] services throughout Ann Arbor and nearby [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]]. A separate free bus service operates within the University of Michigan campuses. Plans have been floated several times to operate a trolley service between downtown and Briarwood Mall along disused rail tracks, although these have not come to fruition as of 2005. For out-of-town bus service, a downtown bus depot is served by [[Greyhound Lines]], and is the city's only remaining example of the [[Streamline Moderne]] architectural style.

[[Ann Arbor Municipal Airport]] is a small aircraft general aviation facility located south of [[Interstate 94|I-94]]. [[Detroit Metropolitan Airport]], the area's large international airport, is located about 28 miles (45 km) east of the city, in [[Romulus, Michigan|Romulus]]. Additionally, [[Willow Run Airport]] in nearby Ypsilanti serves freight, corporate, and general aviation clients, and some people use [[Windsor Airport]], 50 miles (80 km) east of the city, for commercial flight as it can actually be a shorter trip than the Detroit airport depending on traffic.

The city was a major rail hub, notably for freight traffic between [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and ports north of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] from 1878 to 1982, though the [[Ann Arbor Railroad]] also sold 1.1 million passenger tickets in 1913 alone.{{ref|train}} The city was also served by the [[Michigan Central Railroad]] starting in 1837. Currently, [[Amtrak]] provides passenger rail service from Ann Arbor to [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] and [[Chicago, Illinois]] via the Ann Arbor Train Station; the present-day station neighbors the city's old Michigan Central Depot, which was renovated as a restaurant in 1969. There have been plans to build a [[commuter rail]] link between Ann Arbor and Detroit, with the U.S. federal government providing [[United States dollar|$]]100 million to enable its development.{{ref|train2}}

===Utilities===
[[Image:AnnArborHydrant.JPG|thumb|120px|right|One of 39 downtown [[fire hydrant]]s [http://www.arts.umich.edu/programs/special/firehydrant/index.html painted by students]. This hydrant's artist was in elementary school; others were in high school or college.]]
The city provides sewage disposal and water supply services, with water coming from the Huron River and groundwater sources. There are two [[Water purification|water-treatment]] plants, one main and three outlying [[dam|reservoir]]s, four pump stations, and two [[water tower|elevated tanks]]. These facilities serve the city, which is divided into five water districts. Along with these facilities, the city's water department also operates four dams along the Huron River, two of which provide [[hydroelectric power]].{{ref|water}} The city also offers waste management services, with recycling being handled by Recycle Ann Arbor. Other utilities are primarily provided by private entities. [[Electrical power]] and gas are provided by DTE Energy, Consumers Energy, and MichCon. [[AT&amp;T]], the successor to Michigan Bell, [[Ameritech]], and SBC Communications, is the primary wired telephone service provider for the area. Phone service is also available from various [[List of United States mobile phone companies|national wireless companies]]. Cable service is primarily provided by [[Comcast]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Sophia of Hanover.jpg|thumb|150px|The Electress Sophia]]
The '''Act of Settlement''' (12 &amp; 13 Wm 3 c.2) is the main [[Act of Parliament]] that governs the [[Line of succession to the British throne|line of succession]] to the [[British monarchy|British throne]], and since the patriation of each [[Commonwealth Realm]]'s constitution from the UK, now performs the same task within those nations, unless their laws specifically state that the UK Act of Settlement continues to have effect within their jurisdiction.  Thus, the Act is now a key part of the constitutions of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and of the other [[Commonwealth Realms]].

==Background==

Originally an Act of the [[Parliament of England]], it was passed in [[1701]] (1700 in [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style dates]]) during the reign of [[William III of England|King William III]]. As the King was childless, and his wife [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] had died in [[1694]], the throne would pass to Mary's sister, [[Anne of Great Britain|Princess Anne]] on the King's death. However Anne's last surviving child, [[William, Duke of Gloucester]] died in 1700, and it was unlikely she would ever have any more children. Under the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the line of succession was limited to the desdendants of Mary II and Anne, thus there was a need for a new law to allow the succession to continue in the Protestant line, and to exclude the deposed [[James II of England|James II]] and his son, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]].

==Provisions of the Act==

The Act provided that the throne would pass to [[Sophia of Hanover|The Electress Sophia of Hanover]], a granddaughter of [[James I of England|James I/VII]], and her descendants. Only the descendants of Sophia who were not Catholic, or married to a Catholic could succeed the throne. In addition, it specifies that it is for [[Parliament]] to determine who should succeed to the throne, not the monarch.

==Act of Union==

This Act was, in many ways, the major cause of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Union]] of [[Scotland]] with [[England and Wales]] to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].  The [[Parliament of Scotland]] was not happy with the Act of Settlement and, in response, passed the [[Act of Security]] in [[1704]], which gave Scotland the right to choose their own successor to [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].

As a result, the [[Parliament of England]] decided that full union of the two Parliaments and nations was essential before Anne's death, and used a combination of exclusionary legislation (the [[Alien Act of 1705]]), politics, and [[bribery]] to achieve it within three years under the [[Act of Union 1707]].  This was in marked contrast to the four attempts at political union between [[1606]] and [[1689]], which all failed owing to a lack of political will.  By virtue of Article II of the [[Treaty of Union]], which defined the succession to the [[British Crown]], the Act of Settlement became part of [[Scots Law]].

Sophia died before Anne, so the result of the Act was the succession of Sophia's son George as [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]], in preference to many of his cousins.

As a result of the Act of Settlement, several members of the [[British Royal Family]] who have converted to Roman Catholicism or married Roman Catholics have been barred from succeeding to the Crown, though since George I no individual has actually been excluded from the throne on the grounds of religion.

==Present debate==

From time to time there has been debate over removing the clause that keeps [[Roman Catholics]] or those who marry Catholics from ascending to the throne. Proponents argue that the clause is a [[bigoted]] [[anachronism]] and [[Cardinal Winning]], who was leader of the Roman Catholic Church in [[Scotland]], called the act an 'insult' to Catholics. [[Cormac Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor]], the leader of the Catholic Church in England, pointed out that [[Prince William]], &quot;can marry by law a Hindu, a Buddhist, anyone, but not a Roman Catholic.&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2021615.stm] Opponents feel that repeal could lead to a Catholic assuming the throne, and could lead to the disestablishment of the [[Church of England]] as the state religion.  They also point to the fact that the monarch must swear to defend the faith and be a member of the [[Anglican Communion]] and that a Catholic monarch would, like all Catholics, owe allegiance to the Pope which would, according to opponents of repeal such as [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Adrian Hilton]], amount to a loss of [[sovereignty]].

In Canada, where the Act of Settlement is now a part of Canadian constitutional law, [[Tony O'Donohue]], a Canadian civic politician, observed that the ''Act of Settlement 1701'' explicitly excludes [[Roman Catholic]]s from the throne and the Queen is [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], requiring her to be an [[Church of England|Anglican]].  This, he claimed, discriminates against non-Anglicans, including Catholics who are the largest faith group in Canada. In [[2002]], O'Donohue launched an ultimately unsuccessful court action that argued the ''Act of Settlement'' violates the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. His case was dismissed by the court, which found that as the ''Act of Settlement'' is part of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], the Charter of Rights does not have supremacy over it.  Also, the court pointed out that while Canada has the power to amend the line of succession to the Canadian Throne, the ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]'' stipulates that the agreement of the governments of the fifteen other realms that share the Crown would first have to be sought if Canada wished to continue its relationship with the other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s. An appeal of the decision was dismissed [[16 March]], [[2005]]. (See [[O'Donohue v. Her Majesty the Queen, 2003]])

As alluded to above, there are also significant difficulties presented by the fact that the Act of Settlement regulates the succession of all the [[Commonwealth Realm]]s of which the [[Queen regnant|Queen]] is [[Monarch|Sovereign]], either directly or as a now separate, patriated law, and a change in the [[United Kingdom]] would not automatically apply elsewhere - where the Act would be unchanged. This could easily result in the succession being different in certain countries, and a division of the Crown could result. In the 2005 British [[general election]] campaign [[Michael Howard]] promised to work towards having that prohibition removed if the Conservative party gained a majority of seats in the House of Commons. In the event, the election was won by [[Tony Blair]]'s Labour party, who have made no moves to change this law.

'''Aircraft hijacking''' (also known as '''Skyjacking''') is the take-over of an [[aircraft]], by a person or group, usually armed. Unlike the [[hijacking]] of land vehicles, it is usually not perpetrated in order to rob the cargo. Rather, most aircraft hijackings are committed to use the passengers as [[hostage]]s in an effort to obtain transportation to a given location, to hold them for ransom, or, as in the case of the [[United States|American]] planes that were hijacked to [[Cuba]] during the [[1970s]], the release of comrades being held in prison. Another common motive is [[publicity]] for some cause or grievance. In the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the use of hijacked planes as suicide missiles changed the way hijacking was perceived as a security threat &amp;mdash; though similar usages had apparently been attempted by [[Samuel Byck]] in [[1974]] and on [[Air France Flight 8969]] in [[1994]]. 

One task of [[airport security]] is to prevent hijacks by screening passengers and keeping anything that could be used as a  [[weapon]] (even smaller objects like nail clippers and boxcutters, for example) off aircraft.

==Background==
Hijackings for hostages have usually followed a pattern of negotiations between the hijackers and the authorities, followed by some form of settlement -- not always the meeting of the hijackers' original demands -- or the storming of the aircraft by armed police or special forces to rescue the hostages.  Previous to September, 2001, the policy of most airlines was for the pilot to comply with hijackers' demands in the hope of a peaceful outcome.  Since then, policies have reversed course, in favor of arming and armoring the cockpit.

The first recorded aircraft hijack was on [[February 21]], [[1931]], in Arequipa, [[Peru]]. [[Byron Rickards]] flying a Ford Tri-motor was approached on the ground by armed revolutionaries. He refused to fly them anywhere and after a ten day stand-off Rickards was informed that the revolution was successful and he could go in return for giving one of their number a lift to Lima. Most hijackings have not been so farcical. The first hijack of a commercial airliner probably happened on [[June 16]], [[1948]], when a failed attempt to gain control of the [[Miss Macao]], a [[Cathay Pacific]] seaplane caused it to crash into the sea off [[Macau]]. On June 30 1948, a [[Bulgarian]] commercial [[Junkers]] plane was successfully hijacked to [[Istanbul]] by a discharged diplomat and his family, who had to shoot dead the co-pilot (who happened to be the head of Bulgaria's civil aviation) and the radio operator in order to escape to the Free World.  
On [[September 12]] [[1948]] a [[Greece|Greek]] [[Olympic Airways|T.A.E Airlines]] plane was successfully hijacked by 6 pro-communist students who wanted passage to [[Yugoslavia]]. The plane landed near [[Skopje]] and returned to [[Thessaloniki]] later that evening.

Since 1947, 60% of hijackings have been refugee escapes. In 1968-69 there was a massive rise in the number of hijackings. In 1968 there were 27 hijackings and attempted hijackings to Cuba. In 1969 there were 82 recorded hijack attempts worldwide, more than twice the total attempts for the whole period 1947-67. Most were [[Palestinian]]s using hijacks as a political weapon to publicise their cause and to force the Israeli government to release Palestinian prisoners from jail.

Airliner hijackings have declined since the peak of 385 incidents between 1967-76. In 1977-86 the total had dropped to 300 incidents and in 1987-96 this figure was reduced to 212.

== Partial list of hijackings ==
*[[1958]]: First Cuba-to-U.S. hijacking
*[[1960]]: The first US-to-Cuba hijacking 
*[[1968]]: The first Arab-Israeli hijacking, as three members of [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) hijack an [[El Al]] plane to [[Rome]]. Diverting to Algiers the negotiations extend over forty days. Both the hijackers and the hostages go free. This was the first and the only successful hijacking of an El Al flight.
*[[1970]] [[May 15]]: [[Dymshits-Kuznetsov hijacking affair]], a group of Soviet [[refusenik]]s attempt to hijack aircraft
*[[1970]], September: As part of the [[Dawson's Field hijackings]], PFLP members attempt to hijack four aircraft simultaneously. They succeed on three and force the planes to fly to the [[Jordan]]ian desert, where the hijackers blow up the aircraft after releasing most of the hostages. The final hostages are freed in exchange for seven Palestinian prisoners.  The fourth attack on an [[El Al]] plane by two people including [[Leila Khalid]] is foiled by armed guards aboard.
*[[1971]]: [[D. B. Cooper]] hijacks [[Northwest Orient Airlines]] flight 305 and obtains $200,000 ransom for the release of the plane's passengers.  Cooper proceeds to [[parachute]] from the rear of the [[Boeing 727]] and is never found.
*[[1974]] [[February 22]]: [[Samuel Byck]] shot and killed Maryland Aviation Administration Police Officer Neal Ramsburg at BWI before storming aboard [[Delta Air Lines]] flight 523 to Atlanta. He gained access to the cockpit while the plane was on the ground, intending to assassinate [[President Nixon]] by flying the [[DC-9]] into the [[White House]]. He shot both the pilot and the copilot before he was shot through the aircraft window by another officer.  
*[[1976]]: The Palestinian hijack of [[Air France]] [[Air France Flight 193|Flight 193]] airliner is brought to an end at [[Entebbe]] [[Airport]], [[Uganda]] by [[Operation Entebbe]]: Israeli commandos assault the building holding the hijackers and hostages; they kill all the Palestinian hijackers and free 105 mostly Israeli hostages; three passengers and one commando are killed.
*[[1977]]: A Palestinian hijack of a [[Lufthansa]] airliner ''[[Landshut (hijacking)|Landshut]]'' during its flight from [[Palma de Mallorca]] to [[Frankfurt]] is ended in [[Mogadishu, Somalia|Mogadishu]] when [[Germany|German]] commandos storm the plane. Three hijackers are killed and 86 hostages are freed. The hand of German [[Red Army Faction]] is suspected. The pilot is killed.
*[[1978]]: Two Arab guerrillas seized a plane in [[Cyprus]]. Egyptian commandos flew in uninvited to try to take the plane. Cypriot troops resisted and 15 Egyptians died in a 45-minute battle.
*[[1979]]: Two East Germans hijacked an airplane to [[West Berlin]]; see [[Judgment in Berlin]].
*[[1981]]: A [[Pakistan International Airlines]] jet is hijacked and taken to [[Kabul]], where one passenger is killed before the plane flies on to [[Damascus]]; the hostages are finally released after 13 days when the Pakistani Government agrees to free fifty political prisoners.
*[[1981]] [[September 29]]: An [[Indian Airlines]] plane carrying 111 passengers and a crew of six was hijacked by five Sikh militants carrying knives and swords. The airplane was taken to Lahore, Pakistan where Pakistani commandos overpowered the hijackers and rescued the passengers. It was related to the secessionist struggle in the Indian state of Punjab.
*[[1982]] [[July 1]]: A Sri Lankan man, identified as Sepala Ekanayaka, who is 33 years old, hijacked an Alitalia jumbo jet. Ordeal ended after 32 hours, in which he had threatened to blow up the jetliner. With hands in the air, the hijacker and more than 100 hostages walked off the plane without an incident.
*[[1982]] [[August 22]]: A lone Sikh militant, armed with a pistol and a hand grenade, hijacked a Boeing 737 on a scheduled flight from Bombay to New Delhi carrying 69 persons. Indian security forces killed the hijacker and rescued all passengers. 
*[[1983]]: [[Tbilisi hijacking incident]]
*[[1984]] [[August 24]]: Seven young Sikh hijackers demanded an Indian Airlines jetliner on a domestic flight be flown to the United States. The plane was taken to UAE where the defense minister of UAE negotiated the release of the passengers. It was related to the Sikh secessionist struggle in the Indian state of Punjab.  
*[[1984]]: Lebanese Shi'a hijackers divert a [[Kuwait Airways]] flight to [[Tehran]]. The plane is taken by Iranian security forces.
*[[1985]]: Lebanese Shi'a hijackers divert [[TWA Flight 847]] from [[Athens]] to [[Beirut]] with 153 people on board. The stand-off ends after [[Israel]] frees 31 Lebanese prisoners.
*[[1985]]: Palestinians take over [[EgyptAir Flight 648]] and fly it to [[Malta]]. All together, 60 people died, most of them when Egyptian commandos stormed the aircraft.
*[[1986]]: 22 people are killed when Pakistani security forces storm [[Pan Am Flight 73]] at [[Karachi]], carrying 400 passengers and crew after a 16-hour siege.
*[[1990]]: Hijackers seized a plane from the [[People's Republic of China]] which later crashed as it tried to land in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], killing 128 people. 
*[[1991]]: 26 March 1991, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 117]] hijacked by hijackers claiming to be members of the [[Pakistan People's Party]]. Elite [[Singapore Special Operations Force]] members stormed the plane, killing all four hijackers and freeing all 118 passengers and 9 crew in an operation lasting just 30 seconds. None of the passengers and crew were hurt.
*[[1994]]: [[FedEx Corporation|FedEx]] [[FedEx Flight 705|Flight 705]] hijacked by disgruntled employee [[Auburn Calloway]] as it left [[Memphis, Tennessee]], with the intention of using it as a cruise missile against FedEx HQ.  He was subdued by the flight crew before an emergency landing back at Memphis.
*[[1994]]: Frank Eugene 38, a drunk pilot crashed a [[Cessna]] into the [[White House]].
*[[1995]]: Iranian defector and flight attendant [[Rida Garari]] hijacked [[Kish Air]] flight 707, which landed in Israel. No casualties.
*[[1996]]: [[Ethiopian Airlines]] [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961|Flight 961]] crashed into the [[Indian Ocean]] near a beach in the [[Comoros Islands]] after hijackers refused to allow the pilot to land and refuel the plane. 125 passengers die and 50 survive.  This is only the third incident in which there were survivors of a passenger jet that intentionally ditched into water. 
*[[1997]]: [[Air Malta]] Two men who hijacked an Air Malta airplane en route from Malta to Turkey on June 9, 1997 surrendered to police at Cologne's airport early on the same day and freed without incident about 80 crew members and passengers on board.
*[[1999]]: [[All Nippon Airways Flight 61]] is hijacked by a lone man. He kills the pilot before he is subdued.
*[[1999]]-[[2000]]: [[Kashmir]]i militants hijack [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]] and divert it to [[Kandahar]]. After a week-long stand-off India agrees to release three jailed Kashmiri militants in exchange for the hostages. 1 hostage was stabbed to death and his body thrown on the tarmac as a &quot;warning attack&quot;
*[[2001]]: [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], eastern [[United States|USA]]: 19 terrorists hijack four planes ([[American Airlines]] [[American Airlines Flight 11|Flight 11]], [[American Airlines Flight 77]], [[United Airlines]] [[United Airlines Flight 93|Flight 93]], and [[United Airlines Flight 175]]; two of the planes, [[United Airlines Flight 175]] and [[American Airlines Flight 11|Flight 11]], are used as missiles and deliberately flown into each of New York City's Twin Towers, while [[American Airlines Flight 77]] is used in a similar fashion at the Pentagon, in [[Washington, D.C.]].  They are the three most deadly of all aircraft hijackings.  In the fourth case the intention is likely the same but the passengers, learning of the fate of the other three planes, attacked the cockpit, causing the hijackers to crash the plane in rural Pennsylvania, killing all on board. By official count, 2,752 people died at the World Trade Center, 189 died in Washington, D.C., and 44 died in Pennsylvania.

==Prevention==

There has been talk of fortifying [[cockpit]] doors to prevent would-be hijackers from entering and gaining control of the aircraft. In the [[United States]] and [[Australia]], [[air Marshal (civil aviation)|air marshal]]s have also been added to some flights to deter and thwart hijackers. In addition, some have proposed remote control systems for aircraft whereby no one on board would have control over the plane's flight.

In the case of a serious risk that an aircraft will be used for flying into a target, it may have to be shot down, killing all passengers and crew, to prevent worse. 

United States commercial aircraft pilots now have an option of carrying a pistol on the flight deck, as a last resort to thwart hijack attempts. Opponents proposed that shooting down the aircraft and killing everyone onboard would be more reasonable than a pilot firing a pistol in an airliner at a flight deck intruder.  Explosive decompression in an aircraft, however, is a myth, and their objections are mostly hyperbole. [http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/2606]

Since &quot;Hi, Jack&quot; and &quot;hijack&quot; are [[homophones]] while aircraft are very vulnerable to any breaches to safety and security, this pronunciation is now widely regarded as a serious taboo in more airports. [[Los Angeles International Airport]] has reminded people not to say &quot;Hi, Jack&quot;, but &quot;Hello, Jack&quot; is no problem.

The '''Acropolis of Athens''' is the best known [[acropolis]] (high city) in [[Greece]]. Although there are many other acropoleis in Greece, the significance of the Acropolis of Athens such that it is commonly known as '''The Acropolis''' without qualification. The Acropolis is a flat-topped rock which rises 150 metres (512 feet) above sea level in the city of [[Athens, Greece|Athens]], [[Greece]]. It was also known as '''Cecropia''' in honor of the legendary [[snake|serpent]]-man, Kekrops or [[Cecrops]], the first Athenian king.

'''Coordinates:''' {{coor dms|37|58|17|N|23|43|36|E|}}

==Geology of the rock==

[[Image:ac.acropolis4.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Acropolis of Athens, seen from the north, with the restored [[Stoa of Attalus]] in the foreground]]

The Acropolis rises sharply from the plain of [[Attica]] with steep cliffs on three sides. It is accessible by foot only to the west, where it is linked by a low ridge to the hill of the [[Areopagus]]. It is formed by a layer of blue-grey [[limestone]], which is very hard but water-permeable.  This rests on a layer of [[schist]]-[[sandstone]] [[marl]], softer than the limestone but water-impermeable.  This arrangement leads to the ready formation of artesian springs, as well as sheltered caves at the hill's feet, which was also a factor that attracted human habitation on and around the rock from early on.

==Early human presence==

[[Image:ac.acropolis2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The south wall of the Acropolis of Athens, seen from the [[Theatre of Dionysus]].]]

The earliest artefacts from the area point to the Middle [[Neolithic]] era, although there have been documented habitations in Attica from the Early Neolithic ([[6000 BCE]]).  Once into the [[Bronze Age]], there is little doubt that a [[Mycenaean]] [[megaron]] must have stood on top of the hill, housing the local potentate and his household, guards, the local cult facilities and a number of workshops and ordinary habitations.  The compound was surrounded by a thick [[Cyclopean]] circuit wall (between 4.50 and 6onsisting of two [[parapet]]s built with large stone blocks and cemented with an earth mortar called ''emplekton''.  The wall follows typical Mycenaean convention in that its gate was arranged obliquely, with a parapet and tower overhanging the incomers' right-hand side, thus facilitating defense.  There were two lesser approaches up the hill on its north side, consisting of steep, narrow flights of steps cut in the rock.  [[Homer]] must refer to this state of affairs when he mentions the &quot;strong-built House of [[Erechtheus]]&quot; ([[Odyssey]] 7.81).  It was during that time that an earthquake caused a fissure near the northeastern edge, one that ran all the way down to the marl layer and in which water duly collected.  An elaborate set of stairs was built and the well was used as a protected source of drinking water during some portion of the Mycenaean period, as it was invaluable in times of siege.

==The Dark Ages==

[[Image:ac.acropolis2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Acropolis of Athens, seen from the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus]] to the south-east.]]

It seems that the Acropolis might have been spared of the violent destruction of other Mycenaean palaces, as there are no signs of fire or other large-scale destruction in what few artefacts of that time survive.  This ties with the standard Athenian folklore that the area resisted the Dorians successfully.  Not much is known as to the precise state of building on the rock leading up to the archaic era, except that the Acropolis was taken over by [[Cylon (ancient Athenian)|Kylon]] in the Kylonian revolt, and twice by [[Pisistratus]]: all attempts directed at seizing political power by ''[[coup]]s d' etat''.  Nevertheless it seems that a nine-gate wall, the ''Enneapylon'', had been built around the biggest water spring, the &quot;[[Clepsydra]]&quot;, at the northwestern foot.  It was [[Pisistratus]] who initially established a precinct for [[Artemis]] ''Brauronia'', the cult of his hometown, [[Brauron]], on the southwestern side of the rock, next to the circuit wall.

==Archaic Acropolis==

[[Image:Acropolis of Athens 31344.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Stairs leading up to the Propylea.]]

It is known with some certainty that a sizeable temple sacred to Athena Polias (Protectress of the City) was erected by mid-[[6th century BC]]. This Doric limestone building, from which many relics survive, is referred to as the &quot;Bluebeard&quot; temple, named after the pedimental three-bodied man-serpent sculpture, whose beards were painted dark blue.  Whether this temple replaced an older one, or a mere sacred precinct or altar, is not known.  In the late [[6th century BC]] yet another temple was built, usually referred to as the ''Archaios Naos'' (Old Temple). It is thought that the so-called ''Doerpfeld'' foundations might have belonged to this temple, which may have been sacred not to Polias but to Athena ''Parthenos'' (Virgin), at least for as long as the Polias &quot;Bluebeard&quot; temple stood.  It is not known how long these temples coexisted.  To confuse matters further, by the time the &quot;Bluebeard&quot; Temple had been dismantled, a yet newer and grander marble building, the &quot;Older Parthenon&quot;, was started following the victory at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] in 490 BCE. To accommodate it, the south part of the summit was cleared of older remnants, made level by adding some 8,000 two-ton blocks of [[Piraeus]] limestone, a foundation 11 meters deep at some points, and the rest filled with earth kept in place by the retaining wall.  The Mycenaean gate was demolished and replaced with the ''Old Propylon'', a monumental colonnaded structure whose purpose was strictly ceremonial, rather than defensive.  The Older Parthenon was caught unfinished by the invading Persians in [[480 BCE]], and was razed to the ground and burnt, along with the ''Archaios Neos'' and practically everything else on the rock.  Once the [[Persian Wars]] were over, the Athenians put the place in order, first ceremonially burying objects of worship and art that were rendered unsuitable for further use.  This &quot;[[Perserschutt|Persian debris]]&quot; is the richest archaeological treasure excavated on the Acropolis, as its burial had protected it from further destruction through the ages.

==The Periclean building program==

[[Image:Acropolis of Athens 01361.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The western side of the Parthenon.]]

Most of the major temples were rebuilt under the leadership of [[Pericles]] during the [[Golden Age]] of Athens (460–430 BC). [[Phidias]], a great Athenian sculptor, and [[Ictinus]] and [[Callicrates]], two famous architects, were responsible for the reconstruction. 

During the [[5th century BC]], the acropolis gained its final shape. After winning at [[Battle of the Eurymedon|Eurymedon]] in [[468 BC]], [[Cimon]] and [[Themistocles]] ordered the reconstruction of southern and northern walls, and [[Pericles]] entrusted the building of the [[Parthenon]] to Ictinus and [[Phidias]].  In [[437 BC]] [[Mnesicles]] started building the [[Propylaea]], monumental gates with columns of [[Penteli]] [[marble]], partly built upon the old propylaea of Pisistratus.  These colonnades were almost finished in the year [[432 BC]] and had two wings, the northern one serving as picture gallery.  At the same time, south of the propylaea, the building of the small Ionic temple of [[Athena Nike]] started.  After an interruption caused by the [[Peloponnesian War]], the temple was finished in the time of [[Nicias]]' peace, between [[421 BC]] and [[415 BC]].

At the same period they started the building of the [[Erechtheum]], a combination of sacred precincts including the temples of ''Athena Polias'', [[Poseidon]], Erechtheus, Cecrops, Erse, Pandrosos and Aglauros, with its so-called the ''Kore Porch'' (or ''[[Caryatid]]s' balcony''). Between the temple of Athena Nike and the Parthenon there was the [[temenos]] of [[Artemis]] Brauronia, the goddess represented as a bear and worshipped in the [[deme]] of Brauron.  The archaic ''[[xoanon]]'' of the [[goddess]] and a statue made by [[Praxiteles]] in the [[4th century BC]] were both in the sanctuary.  Behind the Propylaea, Phidias' gigantic bronze statue of ''[[Athena Promachos]]'' (&quot;she who fights in the front line&quot;), built between [[450 BC]] and [[448 BC]], dominated the ensemble.  The base was 1.50 meters high, while the total height of the statue was 9 meters.  The goddess held a lance whose gilt tip could be seen as a reflection by crews on ships rounding Cape [[Sounion]], and a giant shield on the left side, decorated by [[Mys]] with images of the fight between the [[Centaur]]s and the [[Lapiths]]. Other monuments that have left almost nothing visible to the present day are the [[Chalcotheke]], the [[Pandroseion]], [[Pandion's sanctuary]], Athena's altar, Zeus Polieus's sanctuary and, from Roman times on, the circular temple of [[Augustus]] and [[Rome]].

== Cultural significance ==

[[Image:Acropolis of Athens 01391.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Erechtheum and Athena's olive tree.]]

Every four years the Athenians held a festival called the [[Panathenaea]] that rivalled the [[Olympic Games]] in popularity. During the festival, a procession moved through Athens up to the Acropolis and into the [[Parthenon]] (as depicted in the frieze on the inside of the Parthenon). There, a vast robe of woven wool (''[[peplos]]'') was ceremoniously placed on Phidias' massive ivory and gold statue of [[Athena]].

== Art and architecture ==
The entrance to the Acropolis was a monumental gateway called the [[Propylaea]]. At the near right of the Propylaea is the tiny [[Temple of Athena Nike]]. A bronze statue of Athena, sculpted by [[Phidias]], originally stood at its center. At the center of the acropolis is the [[Parthenon]] or Temple of Athena Parthenos (Athena the Virgin). To the left of the Propylaea is the [[Erechtheum]] with columns known as caryatids sculpted as figures of women . There is also the remains of an outdoor theater called [[Theatre of Dionysus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Adam Weishaupt''' ([[February 6]], [[1748]] - [[November 18]], [[1811]]) was a German who founded the Order of the [[Illuminati]].

He was born and raised in [[Ingolstadt]], where he attained the rank of Professor of Canon Law in [[1772]].  Though he was educated by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] and was clearly influenced by the discretion, loyalty and the hierarchic obedience of the Society of Jesus and was for a time a member of their order, his appointment as Professor of Natural and Canon Law at the University of Ingoldstadt in [[1775]] offended them.  He broke with them and became increasingly [[liberalism|liberal]] in his religious and political views, favoring [[deism]] and a kind of [[millennial]] natural order that swept aside [[state]]s and [[organized religion]].

With the help of [[Adolf Freiherr Knigge]], on [[May 1]], [[1776]] Weishaupt formed the &quot;Order of Perfectibilists&quot;, which was later known as the [[Illuminati]]. Some claim that this founding date is the origin for the date of the [[Communist]] [[May Day]] observance. He adopted the name of &quot;Brother [[Spartacus]]&quot; within the order. Though the Order was not [[egalitarian]] or [[Democracy|democratic]], its mission was to establish a New World Order, which meant the abolition of all governments and religions. 

Weishaupt wrote: '''the ends justified the means'''. The actual character of the society was determined by its [[traditionalist]] enemies to be an elaborate network of [[spies]] and counter-spies. Each isolated [[covert cell|cell]] of initiates reported to a superior, whom they did not know, a party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups, including more recently by the early [[Ba'ath]] party in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]].

Weishaupt was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] Lodge &quot;Theodor zum guten Rath&quot;, at [[Munich]] in [[1777]] by Baron Adolph von Knigge. His project of &quot;illumination, enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason, which will dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice&quot; was an unwelcome reform. Soon however he had developed [[gnostic]] mysteries of his own, with the goal of &quot;perfecting human&quot; nature through re-education to achieve a communal state with nature, freed of government and organized religion. He began working towards incorporating his system of [[Illuminism]] into that of Masonry, with the aim of creating a New World Order.  

He wrote: ''&quot;I did not bring Deism into [[Bavaria]],&quot; he wrote, &quot;more than into [[Rome]]. I found it here, in great vigour, more abounding than in any of the neighboring [[Protestant State]]s. I am proud to be known to the world as the founder of the Illuminati.&quot;''

Weishaupt's [[radical]] [[rationalism]], sweeping away nations and religions, [[private property]] and [[marriage]], with the vocabulary used by the [[French Revolution]], was not likely to succeed. Writings that were intercepted in [[1784]] were interpreted as [[seditious]], and the Society was banned by [[Bavaria]]'s government in [[1784]], Weishaupt lost his position at the [[University of Ingolstadt]] and fled Bavaria. He received the assistance of [[Duke Ernst II]] of [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]] (1745-1804), and lived in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] writing a series of works on Illuminism, including &lt;cite&gt;A Complete History of the Persecutions of the Illuminati in Bavaria&lt;/cite&gt; ([[1785]]), &lt;cite&gt;A Picture of Illuminism&lt;/cite&gt; ([[1786]]), &lt;cite&gt;An Apology for the Illuminati&lt;/cite&gt; ([[1786]]), and &lt;cite&gt;An Improved System of Illuminism&lt;/cite&gt; ([[1787]]). He died there in [[1811]], though his later career was so obscure that some sources place the year of his death at [[1830]].

A century after his death, [[Occult|occultist]] interest in Weishaupt and the Bavarian Illuminati picked up, through the writings of [[Aleister Crowley]]. Modern adepts trace the imagery of [[symbolism]] like the [[eye in the pyramid]], and embrace the secrecy of the Illuminati traditions...

==Quotes about Weishaupt==

:''A human devil.''

:--[[Augustin Barruél]]

:''An enthusiastic philanthropist.''

:--[[Thomas Jefferson]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mtj:@field(DOCID+@lit(tj090050)) ''Thomas Jefferson to Reverend James Madison, January 31, 1800,'' The Thomas Jefferson Papers (American Memory from the Library of Congress)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weishaupt in Fiction==

Adam Weishaupt is referred to repeatedly in the ''[[Illuminatus Trilogy]]'', by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], as the founder of the [[Bavarian Illuminati]], and as an imposter who killed [[George Washington]] and took his place as the first president of the [[United States]]. Washington's portrait on the [[U.S. one-dollar bill|one-dollar bill]] is said to actually be Weishaupt's.

Another fictionalized version, Adam Weisshaupt, appears in ''[[Cerebus]]'', as a combination of Weishaupt and [[George Washington]].  He appears primarily in the '''Cerebus''' and '''Church and State I''' volumes.  His motives are [[Republic]]an confederalizing of city-states in Estarcion (a pseudo-Europe) and the accumulation of capital unencumbered by government or church.

Weishaupt is also mentioned among the mish-mash of complicated conspiricies in the PC game ''[[Deus Ex]]''. During JC Denton's escape from Versalife labs in Hong Kong, he recovers a virus engineered with the molecular structure of 1748. This is revealed to be an Illuminati signature, honoring Weishaupt (it is his birthdate) while at the same time furthering the secret society's objectives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ElectronMagazineAd.jpg|right|thumb|An original press advertisement for the Acorn Electron]]

The '''Acorn Electron''' was a budget version of the [[BBC Micro]] educational/[[home computer]] made by [[Acorn Computers Ltd]]. It had 32 [[kilobyte]]s of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], and its ROM memory included [[BBC BASIC]] along with its operating system.

The Electron was able to save and load programs onto [[compact audio cassette|audio cassette]] via a supplied converter cable that plugged into the [[microphone]] socket of any [[tape recorder]]. It was capable of basic graphics, and could display onto either a television set or a &quot;[[green screen]]&quot; monitor.

At its peak, the Electron was the third best selling micro in the United Kingdom, and total lifetime game sales for the Electron exceeded those of the BBC Micro. There are at least 500 known games for the Electron and the true total is probably in the thousands.

The hardware of the BBC Micro was emulated by a single customized [[Gate array|ULA]] chip designed by Acorn. It had feature limitations such as being unable to output more than one channel of sound where the BBC was capable of three-way polyphony and the inability to provide [[teletext]] mode. The machine architecture also imposed a substantial speed decrease on applications running from RAM, although ROM applications ran at the same speed

The ULA controlled memory access and was able to provide 32K &amp;times; 8 bits of addressable RAM using 4 &amp;times; 64K &amp;times; 1-bit [[random-access memory|RAM]] chips (4164).

==History==
[[Image:ElectronBASIC.png|thumb|right|Acorn Electron BASIC - the first thing displayed when an unexpanded Electron is switched on]]
The Electron was developed during 1983 as a cheap sibling for the [[BBC Micro]] with the intention of capturing the low cost Christmas sales market for that year. Although Acorn were able to shrink substantially the same functionality as the [[BBC Micro|BBC]] into just one chip, manufacturing problems meant that very few machines were available for the Christmas period - to the extent that some shops reported eight presales for every delivered machine.

This was a blow from which the machine never fully recovered, although games sales for it would ultimately outstrip those of the BBC Micro. Following [[Olivetti]]'s 1985 cash injection into Acorn the machine was effectively sidelined.

With hindsight, the machine was too lacking in RAM (a typical program would need to fit in only around 20 kB once display memory is subtracted) and processing power to take on the prevailing [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]]. Despite this, several features that would later be associated with [[BBC Master]] and [[Acorn Archimedes|Archimedes]] were first features of Electron expansion units, including ROM cartridge slots and the [[Advanced Disc Filing System]] - a hierarchical improvement to the BBC's original [[Disc Filing System]].

==Popular upgrades==
===Acorn Plus 1===
[[Image:Electron Plus One.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An Electron with Plus 1 attached]]
The Acorn Plus 1 added two ROM slots, an analogue interface and serial and parallel ports. The analogue interface was normally used for joysticks, the parallel for a printer and the serial for a modem.

Access to ROM memory occurred at 2 MHz regardless of graphics mode so theoretically programs released on ROM could run at least twice as fast as those released on tape or disc. Despite this all of the games released on ROM were packaged as 'serial ROMS', from which the micro would load programs into main memory in exactly the same way as if it was loading from tape. This meant that programs did not need to be modified for their new memory location but gave no execution speed benefits whatsoever.

===Acorn Plus 3===
The Acorn Plus 3 was a hardware module that connected independently of the Plus 1 that added a double density 3.5&quot; disc drive connected through a WD1770 drive controller and an [[Advanced Disk Filing System|ADFS]] ROM. Because the WD1770 is capable of single density mode and uses the same IBM360 derived floppy disc format as the NEC8271 found in the BBC Micro it was also possible to run a [[Disc Filing System|DFS]] filing system with an alternate ROM.
===P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 3===
[[Image:Advanced_Plus_3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 3 with a 3.5&quot; drive]]
The Advanced Plus 3 was very similar to the Acorn Plus 3 but packaged as a ROM catridge for the Plus 1 with a disc drive connector at the head. This made it possible to connect a 5.25&quot; floppy disc drive as used by BBC Micro owners or a more common 3.5&quot; drive.

===Slogger/Elektuur Turbo Board===
The Slogger and Elektuur Turbo Boards were born out of a hack initially devised at Acorn. By moving the lowest 8 kB of RAM outside of reach of the ULA, the CPU could always access it at 2 MHz. The tradeoff was that the screen could not be located in that 8 kB. In practice the operating system ROMs always put the screen into the top 24 kB and as a result this probably only broke compatibility with around 2% of software.

The Slogger Turbo Board was a professionally fitted upgrade whereas the Elektuur modification was described in an article in Dutch Electronic's magazine Elektuur and intended for users to perform at home.

Speeding up the low portion of memory is particarly useful on 6502 derived machines because that processor has a faster addressing mode for the first 256 and so it is common for software to put any variables involved in time critical sections of program into that region.

If Acorn had thought to include this small modification in the original Electron design it is likely the machine would have had a much greater impact as it would have nearly doubled the amount of motion possible in games and saved modes 0-3 (including the only 16 colour mode) from being nearly useless due to contended memory timings.

===Slogger Master RAM Board===
A development of the Turbo Board, the Master RAM Board duplicated the Turbo Board functionality and added a further option of running the micro with 32 kB of shadow RAM in addition to the ordinary 32 kB - giving 64 kB total. Some clever program counter catches meant that the ordinary system ROMs and any software using the OS calls could function without significant modification, making substantially more memory available for BASIC, View, Viewsheet and almost every other business application.

Applications could not directly address video memory in this mode without modification so it was incompatible with most games although there is no inherent reason why a game couldn't be written to function in shadow mode.

During its decline, Master RAM Boards were added to every Electron to try and increase sales.
===Jafa Systems Mode 7 Display Unit===
Of the capabilities present in the BBC Micro but absent from the Electron, the teletext style ''mode 7'' was particularly conspicuous because of the very low memory usage in that mode (just less than 1 kB) and the high number of BBC programs that used it. Jafa Systems provided a number of solutions to redress this deficiency.

The most basic solution was a pure software system supplied on a ROM cartridge that drew a low resolution approximation of the mode 7 display in a graphics mode. Although cheap and effective in enabling use of some software that only used official ROM entry points for text output, this solution proved very slow because the Electron had to be placed into an 80 byte pitch display to be able to get anywhere near to reproducing mode 7 and the CPU spent a lot of time drawing approximations of mode 7 characters and graphics that in a hardware solution would be achieved without any CPU processing. It also used up 20 kB of RAM for the graphics display rather than the 1 kB of a hardware mode 7.

Two solutions with additional hardware were provided. The first used the same graphics processor as the BBC Micro in mode 7 - the [[SAA5050]] - but used software to ensure that it was fed with the correct graphics data. A software ROM would put the machine into an ordinary 40 byte pitch display. While the ULA would read the display from memory in the usual fashion, the SAA5050 would listen to the data it was reading and produce a mode 7 interpretation of the same information. When necessary the hardware would switch between the graphics output being produced by the micro and that being produced by the add-on.

The disadvantage to this system is that while the SAA5050 would expect to be repeatedly fed the same 40 bytes of data for every display scanline of every character row, the ULA would read a different set of 40 bytes for every display scanline in order to produce a full graphics display. A software ROM worked around this by duplicating the data intended for a mode 7 display in memory. Although this produced a mode 7 that barely impacted upon CPU performance and gave the same visual quality as the BBC Micro, it remained compatible only with software that used the ROM routines for outputting text and graphics and still used 10 kB of memory for the display.

A second version of the hardware add-on corrected these problems. By adding a [[CRTC6845]] to the package, a full hardware solution was created that did not reduce CPU performance and only used 1 kB of memory for the display. A software ROM was still supplied, but this did no more than expand the hardware ROM so that it knew mode 7 now existed and was able to switch into it.

==Technical information==
===Hardware===
*[[central processing unit|CPU]]: [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502A]]
*Clock rate: variable. CPU runs at 2 [[megahertz|MHz]] when accessing ROM and 1 [[megahertz|MHz]] or 0.5897 [[megahertz|MHz]] (depending on graphics mode) when accessing RAM due to sharing memory access with the video display circuits. The Electron is widely misquoted as operating at 1.79 [[megahertz|MHz]] after measurements derived from speed testing against the thoroughly 2 [[megahertz|MHz]] BBC Micro for various pieces of 'common software'
*Coprocessor: Custom ULA
*[[random-access memory|RAM]]: 32 [[kilobyte|kB]]
*[[read-only memory|ROM]]: 32 [[kilobyte|kB]]
*Text modes: 20&amp;times;32, 40&amp;times;25, 40&amp;times;32, 80&amp;times;25, 80&amp;times;32 (all text output produced by software in graphics modes)
*Graphics modes: 160&amp;times;256 (4 or 16 colours), 320&amp;times;256 (2 or 4 colours), 640&amp;times;256 (2 colours), 320&amp;times;200 (2 colours - spaced display with two blank horizontal lines following every 8 pixel lines), 640&amp;times;200(2 colours - spaced display)
*Colours: 8 colours (TTL combinations of RGB primaries) + 8 flashing versions of the same colours

*Power supply: External PSU, 18[[volt|V]]

===Quirks===
Like the [[BBC Micro]], the Electron was constrained by its very limited memory resources. The largest display modes used 20 kB for the frame buffer whereas the machine only had 32 kB in total. For this reason it was very common that games would not use the entire display, but would use some of the area to which the display was mapped for storage of other game data. If games were happy to be constrained to the lower 156 scanlines of the display, this could be done invisibly to the user and such use was common. Often though, games would play with visible on screen regions of apparently random colours.
===Tricks===
Two notable hardware 'tricks' have been discovered on the Electron hardware - the first switches between modes with blank lines and modes without part way through the display to produce a smooth vertical scroll as in ''Firetrack''. The basic idea is that the blank lines added in modes 3 and 6 create padding at the top of the display so that if a mode without padding is switched to part way through the display then the display position of graphics stored at specific video addresses is shifted downward in multiples of 2 scanlines.

The second 'trick' turns the one channel output into a digital speaker for [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] output as in ''[[Exile (BBC computer game)|Exile]]''. The speaker is attached to a hardware counter and is normally only able to output square tone at a specified frequency, but it can also be disabled completely. By setting the speaker to a frequency outside of the human audible range only the difference between speaker enabled and speaker disabled can be made out, seeming to produce a movement in audio wave terms from a high level to a low level. This gives the effect of a simple toggle speaker similar to that seen in the [[ZX Spectrum]] prior to the addition of a full sound chip in the 128 kB models and can be used to output 1bit audio samples.

However, as the Electron internals bear very little resemblance to the BBC Micro most games use [[firmware]] routines for hardware dependant actions such as selecting a particular graphics mode and as a result full hardware exploitation is substantially less common on the Electron than other popular micros.

==Popular games==
A good range of games were available for the Electron from publishers such as [[Acornsoft]] and [[Superior Software]], notably including:
*[[Elite (computer game)|Elite]]
*[[Chuckie Egg]]
*[[Repton (computer game)|The Repton series]]
*[[Exile (BBC computer game)|Exile]]
*[[Starship Command]]
*[[Thrust (computer game)|Thrust]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''A Fire Upon the Deep''''' ([[1992]]) is a [[science fiction]] [[novel]] written by [[Vernor Vinge]].  It combines superhuman intelligences, well-developed and believable [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], variable physics, space battles, love, betrayal, genocide, [[Usenet]], and more into an exceptional [[space opera]].  ''A Fire Upon the Deep'' won the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Hugo Award]] in [[1993]] (tied with ''Doomsday Book'' by [[Connie Willis]]).

Besides the normal print editions, the novel was included on a [[CD-ROM]] sold by [[ClariNet Communications]] along with the other nominees for the 1993 Hugo awards.  The CD-ROM edition included numerous annotations by the author that reveal his thoughts and intentions about different parts of the book.

{{spoiler}}

Vinge has been deeply concerned about the [[technological singularity]] which makes writing comprehensible and realistic high-tech SF novels nearly impossible. To sidestep the issue, he postulates that the galaxy is divided up into &quot;zones of thought,&quot; where near the center of the galaxy, only simple machines and animal-like intelligences are possible; ranging out to the outer edges of the galaxy, where superhuman intelligences, [[nanotechnology]], and faster-than-light ([[FTL]]) travel are possible.  In other words, the laws of physics vary according to location.

* ''The Unthinking Depths'' is the lowest level, centered about the galactic core.  Organic or machine intelligences of even the simplest level can't function well, if at all.  Space travel is nearly impossible, basically requiring big, dumb automated vessels with neolithic automation and massive redundancy.  These properties make actual exploration of this zone problematic.
* ''The Slow Zone'' is the next layer. FTL travel and communications do not function, dependent as they are on some physical property of the universe whose abrupt termination marks the boundary between the Beyond and the Slow Zone.  Intelligences above the level of human-equivalent are not possible.  Molecular nanotechnology also doesn't function well, if at all.  Earth is deep within the Slow Zone.
* ''The Beyond'' is where the majority of the action takes place in ''A Fire Upon the Deep''. FTL travel is possible, as is FTL communications, though the latter can be prohibitively expensive, often requiring planet-sized transceiver arrays.  Antigravity and mind-machine interfaces, along with many other technological advances work in the Beyond.  There are still limits to how smart organic or machine intelligences may become, most of them dependent on one's proximity to the Slow Zone or The Transcend.
* ''The Transcend'' is where super beings known as Powers reside.  Here there are no limits on nanotechnology, FTL travel is very fast (relative to the Beyond), FTL communications bandwidth is cheap, and there are no limits upon organic or machine intelligences or meldings between the two.  Indeed, each individual Power is a single consciousness comprised of the intelligences, both organic and inorganic, of an entire star system or group of neighboring star systems.  The Powers have passed through the [[technological singularity]] and engage in behavior that is simply beyond human comprehension.  They routinely create intelligent species from scratch, build [[Dyson Spheres]], and in general perform near-miraculous feats of engineering on scales both atomic and cosmic.  They regard involvement in the affairs of races in the Beyond in much the same way that humans would care about the competition for Alpha Male amongst a pack of wild animals.

A prequel to this book was subsequently written, ''[[A Deepness in the Sky]]'', set twenty thousand years earlier in the &quot;Slow Zone&quot; near Earth and detailing the earlier adventures of Pham Nuwen.

Two major plotlines exist in the book, related to the appearance of a malevolent quasi-Power referred to as The Blight.  Accidentally released by human explorers from an ancient library, this intelligence is able to infiltrate and control computer and biological systems, quickly infecting and destroying many star systems in the High Beyond.

Apparently with some knowledge of what they are doing, some of the humans escaping from the infected research colony travel to the edge of the Slow Zone with an object from the library.  They are forced to land their [[sleeper ship]] on a planet with a [[medieval]] civilization of dog-like creatures (the Tines) that think in packs of 4 to 6 individuals.  (In other words, an individual consciousness is carried between several persistent biological entities, who share their thoughts through [[ultrasound|high-frequency sound]]. A single creature is as smart as a clever dog, two to three can form dim intelligence, four to six is the standard, packs of more rapidly degrade into incoherence, although a genius pack of eight was known as one exceptional case. Other configurations are possible, e.g. search lines or camp perimeters with continuous mental link all along, or robotic slave teams.)  The book follows a long-lived conflict between two groups of Tines who now fight over the landed ship (which the closer group immediately attacked) and their future status in the rest of the galaxy, which they previously had no conception of.  One group, led by the Woodcarver, so named for her (sexual identity amongst multi-gender packs is fairly arbitrary) artistic abilities, is helped to develop [[cannon]] and other technology by a survivor, a young human girl, and her toy databank.  The other group, led by Lord Steel ruling for the absent Flenser (named so for his cruel psychological research), develops radio and cannon through the help of her younger brother and his communications with the outside world through the ship.  Both siblings are unaware of the other's survival and alliance with the opposing group.

Simultaneously, a rescue mission is sent from the High Beyond in the form of a human woman, Ravna, a somewhat human man, Pham Nuwen (assembled from leftover body parts by a Power and infused with memories of his former existence), and two Skroderiders, Blueshell and Greenstalk, part of an ancient species of aquatic beings with the appearance of large potted plants, with memory and thinking enhancements provided by the movable Skrodes they maneuver with.  The Power (&quot;Old One&quot;) which created Pham has been killed by The Blight, and [[mind transfer|downloaded]] as much of himself as he could fit into Pham, providing him with subconscious knowledge of how to activate the Countermeasure located on the landed ship.  While fighting off anti-human military forces (humans are purported to be the cause and furtherance of The Blight) they reach the planet and Pham initiates the Countermeasure, a [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] fungus-like substance/device.  It drastically alters the boundaries of the zones of thought, expanding the Slow Zone to envelop The Blight, where it is effectively neutralized.  However, this also ends up killing Pham, stranding the protagonists and many human children (in [[suspended animation]]) on the Tines' world, and a large chunk of the galaxy besides, in the depths of the Slow Zone.  Also implied is that this event thrust thousands of star systems into an environment where technology needed to survive would no longer work; a situation analogous to the state of civilization on Earth were electricity to cease to function.

== Trivia ==
The name &quot;Lord Steel&quot; suggests [[Josef Stalin]] (Russian стал (''stal'') means steel, and -ин (''-in'') is an adjectival suffix), as do many of the Flenserist society's names, mores and structures.

Several subtle references to computer science are found in the book.  For example, at one point Woodcarver mentions that a particular arrangement of the parliament chamber was strangely effective - the arrangement resembles a [[hypercube]].

'''Aeronautics''' is the [[science]] involved with the study, design, and manufacture of [[flight]] capable machines, or the techniques of operating aircraft. This includes a branch of aeronautics called [[aerodynamics]]. Aerodynamics deals with the motion of air and the way it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft. Both of these branches are a part of physical science. [[Aviation]], however, refers to the operation of heavier-than-air craft.

==Early aeronautics==
{{main|Aviation history}}
Before scientific investigation of aeronautics started, people started thinking of ways to fly.  In Greek legend, [[Icarus (mythology)|Icarus]] and his father [[Daedalus]] built wings of feathers and flew out of a prison.  Icarus went to close to the sun and fell.  When people started to scientifically study how to fly, people began to understand the basics of air and aerodynamics.  One of the earliest scientists to study aeronautics was [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Da Vinci studied the flight of birds in developing engineering schematics for some of the earliest flying machines in the late fifteenth century AD. His schematics, however, such as the [[ornithopter]] ultimately failed as practical aircraft. The flapping machines that he designed were either too small to generate sufficient lift, or too heavy for a human to operate. Although the ornithopter continues to be of interest to hobbyists, it was replaced by the glider in the 19th century.

[[Sir George Cayley]] designed the first manned glider, the ''Coachman Carrier'', in 1853. Although unpowered, it successfully flew 130 meters across a valley in [[Scarborough]].

==Modern aeronautics==
Modern aeronautic research is primarily conducted by independent corporations and universities. There are also a number of government agencies that study aeronautics, including [[NASA]] in the [[United States]] and the [[European Space Agency]] in [[Europe]].

==Aeronautical Engineering==
Aeronotical engineering is an engineering area that covers research, design, manufacture and maintenance of products such as aircraft, missiles and space satellites.
It involes scientific topics of [[Aerodynamics]], [[Materials]], [[Technology]], [[Fluid Mechanics]] and [[Aircraft Structures]].

'''The Lumière Brothers''', '''Louis Jean''' ([[5 October]] [[1864]], [[Besançon]], [[France]] &amp;ndash; [[6 June]] [[1948]], [[Bandol]]) and '''Auguste Marie Louis Nicholas''' ([[19 October]] [[1862]], [[Besançon]], [[France]] &amp;ndash; [[10 April]] [[1954]], [[Lyon]]), were the creators of the [[cinematographe]], a three-in-one [[film|motion picture]] camera, developer, and projector, and were among the earliest key [[film director|filmmakers]]. They were both born in Twin Valley, [[Besançon]], [[France]] but brought up in [[Lyon]]. Both attended [[La Martiniere Lyons]]. Their father ran a [[History of the camera|photographic]] firm and both brothers worked for him: Louis as a physicist and Auguste as a manager. Louis had made some improvements to the still photograph process, the most noticeable being the dry plate process which was a major step towards film.

It was not until their father retired in [[1892]] that the brothers set to work to create moving pictures. They patented a number of significant processes - most notably the creation of [[sprocket|sprocket holes]] in the film strip as a means of getting the film through the camera and projector.

They produced a single device that acted as both camera and projector, the [[cinématographe]] which they patented on [[13 February]] [[1895]]. The first footage ever to be shot on the device was shot on [[19 March]] [[1895]]; the film was ''La sortie des usines Lumière'' (literally, ''The Exit From the Lumière Factories'', or, under its more common English title, ''[[Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory|Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory]]'').

The first paying show was on [[The First Cinema Show|28 December 1895]] in Paris at the Grand Café in the Boulevard des Capucines. They went on tour with the cinématographe in [[1896]] visiting [[Bombay]], [[London]] and [[New York]]. The moving images had an immediate and significant influence on popular culture with ''[[L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de la Ciotat]]'' (literally, ''The Arrival of a Train at the Ciotat Station'', but more commonly known as ''Arrival of a Train at a Station'') and also with [[actuality film]]s often cited as the first documentaries - although this is a matter of some debate - such as ''Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory'', ''Le Déjeuner de Bébé'' (''Baby's Lunch'') and the first steps towards comedy with the slapstick of ''[[L'Arroseur Arrosé]]'' (''The Sprinkler Sprinkled'').

However the brothers stated that &quot;the [[film|cinema]] is an [[invention]] without any future&quot; and declined to sell their invention to [[Georges Méliès]] and so their role in the history of film was exceedingly brief. 

They turned their attentions to colour photography and in [[1903]] they patented a colour photography process, the &quot;[[Autochrome Lumière]]&quot;, launched on the market in [[1907]].

The Lumière company was a major producer of photographic products in Europe. The brand name Lumière disappeared from the marketplace following merger with [[Ilford]].

The Lumières also proposed the loudspeaker and Tulle-gras® (to heal burns).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Books of the New Testament}}
The '''''Acts of the Apostles''''' (Greek ''Praxeis Apostolon'') is a book of the [[Bible]], which now stands fifth in the [[New Testament]]. It is commonly referred to as simply '''Acts'''. The traditional view is that it was written by the [[Macedonian]] Christian physician and historian [[Luke the Evangelist]], the companion of [[the apostle Paul]], in the [[first century]] AD.

An alternative name for the book is '''''Acts of the Holy Spirit'''''. It describes many of the journeys and actions taken by the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]], meaning &quot;those who have been sent&quot; by God, to be His witnesses. This was originally applied exclusively to those who had personally seen and/or lived with [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]].  The book of Acts contains many descriptions of miraculous events (which were given as signs from God to [[validate]] the apostles' teachings), which were performed by the Holy Spirit through the apostles. These included [[miraculous]] healings, casting out [[evil spirits]], the raising of the dead, and also historical descriptions of everyday life in the [[Roman Empire]] and in ancient [[Jerusalem]]. 

Acts describes the beginning of the [[Jewish Christians|Jewish-Christian]] church on the Day of [[Pentecost]], explains and describes the growth and spread of the Church despite (and because of) official [[persecution]], narrates the inclusion of the [[gentile]] Greeks, Romans and other [[pagans]] of the [[Near East]] into the Church (and explains how this became possible), and focuses on the lives of the apostles, specifically Simon, called &quot;[[Peter]]&quot; of [[Galilee]] (who followed and lived with Jesus for probably three years) and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saul Paulus of Tarsus]] (who began as a [[Pharisee]] and a persecutor of the Church and was [[religious conversion|convert]]ed later on the [[Road to Damascus]]).

Generally speaking, the book is a historical account of the early years of the church. It focuses mainly on the activities of [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]. It records the history of the Jerusalem Church as led by [[Saint James the Just|James the Just]] from its inception with about 120 members (1:15) composed of [[Jew]]s and [[Proselyte]]s, to Peter baptizing [[Cornelius]] (10:44) ,who is traditionally considered the first [[Gentile]] convert, to the [[Council of Jerusalem]] (15), to James challenging Paul on the rumor that he aims to subvert the [[Law of Moses]] (21:18), to Paul's arrest in Jerusalem.

Internal evidence shows that it was the companion and sequel of the [[Gospel of Luke]] (for instance, they are both addressed to [[Theophilus (Biblical)|Theophilus]], which means &quot;God-lover&quot; or &quot;Beloved by God&quot;); its separation from that [[gospel]] occurred prior to any surviving manuscript. Historically it is of unique interest and value: there is no other book like it within the New Testament. It is the main ancient [[Church]] history; apart from it a connected picture of the [[Apostolic Age]] would be impossible. With it, Paul's letters are of priceless historical value; without it, they would be incomplete or even misleading. 

== Plan and Purpose ==
All agree that Acts is the work of a skilled author, and that he has exercised care in keeping with a definite purpose and plan.

* His second narrative is the natural sequel to his first. The [[Gospel of Luke]] set forth in orderly sequence the stages by which Jesus was led, &quot;in the power of the Spirit,&quot; to begin the establishment of the consummated [[Kingdom of Heaven|Kingdom of God]]. In the same way, Acts aims at showing how the [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]]s were led in sequential stages by the [[Holy Spirit]]. This involves emphasis on the identity of the Divine (not merely human) power expressed in the accounts.

* The [[Holy Spirit]] appears as directing and energizing throughout the apostles' whole struggle with the powers of evil to be overcome; however, it also shows how human effort must also be brought forth to overcome evil. The working of the energy in the disciples is conditioned by the continued life and volition of their Master at His Father's right hand in heaven. The Holy Spirit, &quot;the Spirit of Jesus,&quot; is the living link between Master and disciples. Hence the pains taken to exhibit (1:2, 4f., 8, 2:1ff.; cf. Luke 24:49) the fact of such spiritual solidarity, whereby their activity means His continued action in the world.

* The scope of this action is nothing less than humanity (2:5ff.), especially within the [[Roman Empire]]. It was commanded that [[Messiah]]'s witnesses should go, through divine power, to all the world to spread the Gospel (see [[The Book of Matthew|Matt]] 28:19&amp;ndash;20). The book of Acts was written partially to show how this was accomplished in the early years of the church.

* Finally, as we gather from the parallel account in Luke 24:46&amp;ndash;48, the book was designed to show the divinely appointed method for victory through suffering (Acts 14:22).

This explains the large space devoted to the tribulations of the witnesses, and their constancy in them, after the type of their Lord Himself. It is emphasized in absence of earthly prosperity, which the pagan mind was apt to see as the token of Divine approval.

These, then, seem to be the author's main points: the Gospel is universal; Divine initiative led men of [[Jew|Jewish]] birth to gradually recognize the divine will in the tearing down of national boundaries; and that although difficulty will befall those who attempt to spread the gospel, they shall overcome through the power of the Holy Spirit.

This view has the merit of giving the book a practical religious aim. Though meant for men of pagan birth, it is be as inquirers or even converts, such as &quot;[[Theophilus (Biblical)|Theophilus]],&quot; that the argument (that in spite of all difficulties, this religion is worthy of personal belief) is addressed. Among the reasons why such an appeal was needed were doubtlessly the existence of persecution by the Roman authorities, often at the instigation of local [[Judaism]]. The author holds up the picture of early days, when the great protagonist of the Gospel constantly enjoyed protection at the hands of Roman justice, as a sort of banner of hope. It is implied that the present distress is but a passing phase, resting on some misunderstanding; meantime, the example of apostolic constancy should yield strong reassurance.

== Authorship ==
There is substantial evidence to indicate that the author of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] also wrote the Book of Acts.  The most direct evidence comes from the prefaces of each book.  Both prefaces are addressed to [[Theophilus (Biblical)|Theophilus]], the author's patron (and perhaps a label for a Christian community as a whole as it can be read &quot;Beloved by God&quot;), and the preface of Acts explicitly references &quot;my former book&quot; about the life of Jesus.  

Furthermore, there are linguistic and theological similarities between the two works, suggesting that they have a common author.  With the agreement of nearly all scholars, Udo Schnelle writes, &quot;the extensive linguistic and theological agreements and cross-references between the Gospel of Luke and the Acts indicate that both works derive from the same author&quot; (''The History and Theology of the New Testament Writings'', p. 259).

The external evidence, such as it is, is in favor of authorship by [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], a companion of Paul ([[Epistle to Philemon|Phlm]] 24) who was a physician ([[Epistle to the Colossians|Col]] 4:14).  The oldest manuscript with the start of the gospel, Papyrus Bodmer XIV (around 200), is titled the ''euangelion kata Loukan'', the Gospel according to Luke. [[Irenaeus]] (''Haer.'' 3.1.1, 3.14.1), [[Tertullian]] (''Marc.'' 4.2.2), [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''Paed.'' 2.1.15 and ''Strom.'' 5.12.82), [[Origen]], and the [[Muratorian Canon]] also ascribe the third Gospel to one called Luke.  Neither [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] nor any other ancient writer mentions another tradition about authorship.

Some also consider the internal evidence to favor authorship by Luke.  The thesis that the vocabulary of Luke-Acts is special to a physician met with a rebuttal by H. J. Cadbury in his dissertation ''The Style and Literary Method of Luke'', which argued that the vocabulary is found in nonmedical works; the saying goes that Cadbury earned his doctorate by depriving Luke of his.  Some state that the prominence given to [[Antioch]] in Acts coheres with the tradition of Luke's birth in Antioch. &lt;!-- source for this tradition of birth in Antioch? (beats me)--&gt; It is also argued that the minute character of the narrative and accuracy of the journeyings suggest an eyewitness source. Chief among the features of Luke-Acts that have been thought to support the idea that the author knew Paul are the &quot;we passages&quot; found in 16:10&amp;ndash;17, 20:5&amp;ndash;15, 21:1&amp;ndash;18, and 27:1&amp;ndash;28:16. Some note that the &quot;we&quot; narration drops off at [[Philippi]] and then picks up in the second passage with &quot;We sailed from Philippi,&quot; and conclude from this dovetailing of incidents that the author of Acts was among those left behind at Philippi who joined up with Paul to sail from there later. Other views of the &quot;we passages&quot; include that a first person travel diary was incorporated into Acts, that the first person narration is generic style for sea voyages (according to V. K. Robbins), and that the author was making a false affectation to being a companion of Paul.

Others consider the internal evidence to be against authorship by Luke. Critics of authorship by Luke mention divergence in theology between Luke-Acts and the letters of Paul, to whom Luke was companion.  They also state that there are disagreements between the narrative of Acts and the letters of Paul, such as [[Epistle to Galatians|Galatians]], in describing the period from his conversion to his visit with the apostles in Jerusalem.  Some say that the absence of mention of Paul's letters in Acts speaks to non-Lukan authorship, while others attribute this to Paul's letters being published together after Acts was written.

== Sources ==
[[Image:Codex laudianus.jpg|thumb|right|Acts 15.22&amp;ndash;24 from the seventh-century ''Codex laudianus'' in the [[Bodleian Library]], written in parallel columns of [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].]]
So far from the recognition of a plan in Acts being inimical to a quest after the materials used in its composition, some scholars say that it points the way thereto, while it keeps the literary analysis within scientific limits. These scholars claim that the standpoint of the mind pervading the book as a whole causes them to feel that the speeches in the first part of Acts (e.g., that of [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]])&amp;mdash;and indeed elsewhere, too&amp;mdash;are not &quot;free compositions&quot; of the author, the mere outcome of dramatic idealization such as ancient historians like [[Thucydides]] or [[Polybius]] allowed themselves. The [[Christology]], for instance, of the early Petrine speeches is considered by them to be such as a Gentile Christian writing circa 80 simply could not have imagined.  Thus they are forced to assume the use of a certain amount of early Judaeo-Christian material, in the manner in which he supposedly used the [[Gospel of Mark]] and the [[Q document|Q source]] in compiling his own Gospel.

C.C. Torrey expressed these suspicions in his thesis (''The Composition and the Dates of Acts'', 1916) that an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] source underlay the text of Acts 1&amp;ndash;15, arguing from (1) the preoccupation of this section on the church at [[Jerusalem]], and on the church's Judaic background, and (2) a [[Semitic]] coloring of the language, which he argued was &quot;distinctly translation-[[Greek language|Greek]]&quot; with a number of peculiarities in the language that he claimed were &quot;Semiticisms&quot;. While the recovery of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] has provided us with an irrefutable sample of the language of [[Judea]] in the 1st century AD, severely undermining Torrey's linguistic arguments, study of the content has led to a consensus that the author drew from a set of sources associated with Peter that originated in Jerusalem, and a set of sources associated with Paul that, at least in part, originated in [[Antioch]].

In the second half which focuses almost exclusively on Paul's activities, we are confronted by the so-called &quot;we&quot; passages. Their explanation has led to several theories: (1) they are traces of an earlier document&amp;mdash;whether entries in a travel diary or a more or less consecutive narrative written later; (2) the use of &quot;we&quot; was due to the author's lapsing unconsciously into the first person plural at certain points where he felt specially identified with the history; or (3) this use of &quot;we&quot; was a feature of an ancient convention when talking about sea travel (a thesis proposed by V.K. Robbins in 1975 and embraced by such scholars as [[Helmut Koester]]). The first hypothesis raises the issue whether the &quot;we&quot; document does or does not lie behind more of the narrative than is definitely indicated by the formula in question (e.g., 13&amp;ndash;15, 21:19&amp;ndash;16). The second likewise leads to the question whether the presence or absence of &quot;we&quot; may be due to the writer's absorption in his narrative causes, rather than to the writer's mere presence or absence. However, this alternation from third person to first person plural may be due to emphasis, as [[Martin Hengel]] explains:
:&quot;We&quot; therefore appears in travel accounts because Luke simple wanted to indicate that he was there. However, his personal experiences are uninteresting. Paul remains the sole focal point.
:(''Acts and the History of Earliest Christianity'' Philadelphia: Fortress, 1983)

Robbins's suggestion has been treated with a certain amount of skepticism based on the examples he has produced for this genre; his examples are drawn from [[Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] and [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] literature, and even his Greek examples are fraught with problems that include the fact many of the examples come from narratives told in the first person. [[Joseph Fitzmyer|Joseph A. Fitzmyer]] notes in his commentary to the Anchor Bible translation of Acts, &quot;this 'conventional' literary device is more alleged than demonstrated.&quot;

In both parts of Luke-Acts, scholars suggest that the author collected materials from [[oral tradition]], if not directly from different witnesses, possibly supplemented by the first person knowledge of the author in Acts. In this case, the author would have had the opportunity to collect materials, varying no doubt in accuracy, but all relatively primitive, whether in Antioch or in [[Caesarea Palaestina]], where he may have resided for some two years in contact with men like [[Philip the Evangelist]] (21:8). There and elsewhere he might also have learned a good deal from [[John, surnamed Mark]], Peter's friend ([[1 Peter|1 Pet]] 5:13; Acts 12:12).

== Historical Value ==
The question of authorship is largely bound up with that as to the historicity of the contents. Acts is divided into two distinct parts. The first (chs. 1&amp;ndash;12) deals with the church in Jerusalem and Judaea, and with Peter as central figure&amp;mdash;at any rate in the first five chapters. &quot;Yet in cc. vi.-xii.,&quot; as Harnack observes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;the author pursues several lines at once. (1) He has still in view the history of the Jerusalem community and the original apostles (especially of Peter and his missionary labors); (2) he inserts in vi. 1 ff. a history of the Hellenistic Christians in Jerusalem and of the Seven Men, which from the first tends towards the Gentile Mission and the founding of the Antiochene community; (3) he pursues the activity of [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]] in [[Samaria]] and on the coast...; (4) lastly, he relates the history of Paul up to his entrance on the service of the young Antiochene church.  In the small space of seven chapters he pursues all these lines and tries also to connect them together, at the same time preparing and sketching the great transition of the Gospel from Judaism to the Greek world.  As historian, he has here set himself the greatest task. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

No doubt gaps abound in these seven chapters. &quot;But the inquiry as to whether what is narrated does not even in these parts still contain the main facts, and is not substantially trustworthy, is not yet concluded.&quot; The difficulty is that there are few external means of testing this portion of the narrative. Some of it may  have suffered partial transformation in oral tradition before reaching our author; for example, the nature of [[glossolalia|Speaking the Tongues]] at [[Pentecost]] does not accord with what is known of the gift of &quot;tongues&quot; generally. The second part pursues the history of the apostle Paul, and here the statements made in the Acts may be compared with the Epistles.  The result is a general harmony, without any trace of direct use of these letters; and there are many minute coincidences. But attention has been drawn to two remarkable exceptions: the account given by Paul of his visits to [[Jerusalem]] in [[Epistle to Galatians|Galatians]] as compared with Acts; and the character and mission of the apostle Paul, as they appear in his letters and in Acts. 

In regard to the first point, the differences as to Paul's movements until he returns to his native province of Syria-Cilicia do not really amount to more than can be explained by the different interests of Paul and the author, respectively. But it is otherwise as regards the visits of Galatians 2:1&amp;ndash;10 and Acts 15. If they are meant to refer to the same occasion, as is usually assumed, it is hard to see why Paul should omit reference to the public occasion of the visit, as also to the public vindication of his policy. But in fact the issues of the two visits, as given in Galatians 2:9f. and Acts 15:20f., are not at all the same. Nay more, if Galatians 2:1&amp;ndash;10 = Acts 15, the historicity of the &quot;Relief visit&quot; of Acts 11:30, 12:25 seems definitely excluded by Paul's narrative of events before the visit of Galatians 2:1ff.  Accordingly, [[William Ramsay|Sir W. M. Ramsay]] and others argue that the latter visit itself coincided with the Relief visit, and even see in Galatians 2:10 witness thereto. 

But why does not Paul refer to the public charitable object of his visit? It seems easier to assume that the visit of Galatians 2:1ff. is altogether unrecorded in Acts, owing to its private nature as preparing the way for public developments&amp;mdash;with which Acts is mainly concerned.  In that case, it would fall shortly before the Relief visit, to which there may be tacit explanatory allusion, in Galatians 2:10; and it will be shown below that such a conference of leaders in Galatians 2:1ff. leads up excellently both to the First Mission Journey and to Acts 15. 

As for Paul as depicted in Acts, Paul claims that he was appointed the apostle to the Gentiles, as Peter was to the Circumcision; and that [[circumcision]] and the observance of the [[Halakha|Jewish]] law were of no importance to the Christian as such.  His words on these points in all his letters are strong and decided.  But in Acts, it is Peter who first opens up the way for the Gentiles.  It is Peter who uses the strongest language in regard to the intolerable burden 
of the Law as a means of salvation (15:10f., cf. 1). Not a word is said of any difference of opinion between Peter and Paul at Antioch (Gal 2:11ff.). The brethren in Antioch send Paul and [[Barnabas]] up to Jerusalem to ask the opinion of the apostles and elders: they state their case, and carry back the decision to Antioch. Throughout the whole of Acts, Paul never stands forth as the unbending champion of the Gentiles. He seems continually anxious to reconcile the Jewish Christians to himself by personally observing the law of [[Moses]]. He circumcises the semi-Jew, [[Timothy]]; and he performs his vows in [[Temple in Jerusalem|the temple]]. He is particularly careful in his speeches to show how deep is his respect for the law of Moses. In all this, the letters of Paul are very different from Acts. In Galatians, he claims perfect freedom in 
principle, for himself as for the Gentiles, from the obligatory observance of the law; and neither in it nor in Corinthians does he take any notice of a decision to which the apostles had come in their meeting at Jerusalem.  The narrative of Acts, too, itself implies something other than what it sets in relief; for why should the Jews hate Paul so much, if he was not in some sense disloyal to their Law? 

This is not necessarily a contradiction; only such a difference of emphasis as belongs to the standpoints and aims of the two writers amid their respective historical conditions. Peter's function toward the Gentiles belongs to early conditions present in Judaea, before Paul's distinctive mission had taken shape. Once Paul's apostolate&amp;mdash;a personal one, parallel with the more collective apostolate of &quot;the Twelve&quot;&amp;mdash;has proved itself by tokens of Divine approval, Peter and his colleagues frankly recognize the distinction of the two missions, and are anxious only to arrange that the two shall not fall apart by religiously and morally incompatible usages (Acts 15). Paul, on his side, clearly implies that Peter felt with him that the Law could not justify (Gal 2:15ff.), and argues that it could not now be made obligatory in principle (cf. &quot;a [[yoke]],&quot; Acts 15:10); yet for Jews 
it might continue for the time (pending the [[Parousia]]) to be seemly and expedient, especially for the sake of non-believing Judaism.  To this he conformed his own conduct as a Jew, so far as his Gentile apostolate was not involved (1 Cor 9:19ff.). There is no reason to doubt that Peter largely agreed with him, since he acted in this spirit in Galatians 2:11f., until coerced by Jerusalem sentiment to draw back for expediency's sake.  This incident simply did not fall within the scope of Acts to narrate, since it had no abiding effect on the Church's extension.  As to Paul's submission of the issue in Acts 15 to the Jerusalem conference, Acts does not imply that Paul would have accepted a decision in favor of the Judaizers, though he saw the value of getting a decision for his own policy in the quarter where they were most likely to defer.  If the view that he already had an understanding with the &quot;Pillar&quot; Apostles, as recorded in Galatians 2:1&amp;ndash;10, be correct, it gives the best of reasons why he was ready to enter the later public Conference of Acts 15. Paul's own &quot;free&quot; attitude to the Law, when on Gentile soil, is just what is implied by the hostile rumors as to his conduct in Acts 21:21, which he would be glad to disprove as at least exaggerated (vv. 24 and 26).

(Questions and evidence of historicity are presented in Colin J. Hemer, &quot;The Book of Acts in the Setting of Hellenistic History&quot;, Eisenbrauns, 1990)

=== Speeches ===
The speeches in Acts deserve special notice, because they constitute about 20% of the entire book.  Given the nature of the times, lack of recording devices, and space limitations, many ancient historians did not reproduce verbatim reports of speeches.  Condensing and using one's own style was often unavoidable.  Nevertheless, there were different practices when it came to the level of creativity or adherence individual historians practiced.  

On one end of the scale were those who seemingly invented speeches, such as the Sicilian historian [[Timaeus]] (356&amp;ndash;260 BCE).  Others, such as [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] and [[Tacitus]], fell somewhere in between, reporting actual speeches but likely with significant liberty.  The ideal for ancient historians, however, seems to have been to try as much as possible to report the sense of what was actually said, rather than simply placing one's own speech in a figure's mouth.  

Perhaps the best example of this ideal was voiced by [[Polybius]], who ridiculed Timaeus for his invention of speeches.  Historians, Polybius wrote, were &quot;to instruct and convince for all time serious students by the truth of the facts and the speeches he narrates&quot; (''Hist.'' 2.56.10&amp;ndash;12). Another ancient historian, [[Thucydides]], admits to having taken some liberty while narrating speeches, but only when he did not have access to any sources.  When he had sources, he used them. In his own words, Thucydides wrote speeches &quot;of course adhering as closely as possible to the general sense of what was actually said&quot; (''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 1.22.1).   Accordingly, as stated by C.W. Fornara, &quot;[t]he principle was established that speeches were to be recorded accurately, though in the words of the historian, and always with the reservation that the historian could 'clarify'&quot; (''The Nature of History in Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 145).

On what end of the scale did the author of Acts fall?  There is little doubt that the speeches of Acts are summaries or condensations largely in the style and vocabulary of its author.  However, there are indications that the author of Acts relied on source material for his speeches, and did not treat them as mere vehicles for expressing his own theology.  The author's apparent use of speech material in the [[Gospel of Luke]], obtained from the [[Gospel of Mark]] and the hypothetical [[Q document]] or the [[Gospel of Matthew]], suggests that he relied on other sources for his narrative and was relatively faithful in using them.  Additionally, many scholars have viewed Acts' presentation of [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]]'s speech, Peter's speeches in Jerusalem and, most obviously, Paul's speech in [[Miletus]] as relying on source material or of expressing views not typical of Acts' author.[http://www.christiancadre.org/member_contrib/cp_acts.html] Additionally, there is no evidence that any speech in Acts is the free composition of its author, without either written or oral basis.  Accordingly, in general, the author of Acts seems to be among the conscientious ancient historians, touching the essentials of historical accuracy, even as now understood.

=== Miracles ===
[[Skeptic]]s object to the trustworthiness of Acts on the ground of its reports of [[miracle|miracles]], while [[apologetics|apologists]] defend the work as containing earlier sources. 

There are possibilities of mistakes intervening between the facts and the accounts reaching its author, at second- or even thirdhand.  Some modern scholars argue that Acts shows several errors, and suggest its value as history is doubtful. However, the use of &quot;we&quot; at some points in the book suggests its author was an eyewitness to some of the events he describes.

''[[Quellenkritik]]'', a distinctive feature of recent research upon Acts, solves many difficulties in the way of treating it as an honest narrative by a companion of Paul. In addition, we may also count among recent gains a juster method of judging such a book. For among the results of the [[Tübingen]] criticism was what Dr. W. Sanday calls &quot;an unreal and artificial standard, the standard of the 19th century rather than the [[1st century|1st]], of [[Germany]] rather than [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], of the lamp and the study rather than of active 
life.&quot; This has a bearing, for instance, on the differences between the three accounts of Paul's conversion in Acts. In the recovery of a more real standard, we owe much to men like [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], Ramsay, [[Friedrich Blass|Blass]] and Harnack, trained amid other methods and traditions than those which had brought the constructive study of Acts almost to a deadlock.

== Structure ==
&lt;!-- shorten; edit for clarity --&gt;
The structure of the book of [[Luke]] is closely tied with the structure of Acts. Both books are most easily tied to the geography of the book. [[Luke]] begins with a global perspective, dating the birth of [[Christ]] to the reign of the [[Roman emperors]] in Luke 2:1 and 3:1. From there we see Jesus' ministry move from [[Galilee]] (chapters 4&amp;ndash;9), through [[Samaria]] and [[Judea]] (chs. 10&amp;ndash;19), to [[Jerusalem]] where he is [[Crucifixion|crucified]], raised and ascended into [[heaven]] (chs. 19&amp;ndash;24). 
The book of Acts follows just the opposite motion, taking the scene from [[Jerusalem]] (chs. 1&amp;ndash;5), to [[Judea]] and [[Samaria]] (chs. 6&amp;ndash;9), then traveling through [[Syria]], [[Asia Minor]], and [[Europe]] towards [[Rome]] (chs. 9&amp;ndash;28). This [[chiastic structure]] emphasizes the centrality of the [[resurrection]] and [[ascension]] to Luke's message, while emphasizing the universal nature of the gospel. 

This geographic structure is foreshadowed in Acts 1:8, where Jesus says &quot;You shall be My witnesses both in [[Jerusalem]] (chs. 1&amp;ndash;5), and in all [[Judea]] and [[Samaria]] (chs. 6&amp;ndash;9), and even to the remotest part of the earth (chs. 10&amp;ndash;28).&quot; The first two sections (chs. 1&amp;ndash;9) represent the witness of the apostles to the [[Jew]]s, while the last section (chs. 10&amp;ndash;28) represent the witness of the apostles to the [[Gentiles]].

The book of Acts can also be broken down by the major characters of the book. While the complete title of the book is the Acts of the Apostles, really the book focuses on only two of the apostles: [[Peter]] (chs. 1&amp;ndash;12) and [[Paul]] (chs. 13&amp;ndash;28).

Within this structure, the sub-points of the book are marked by a series of summary statements, or what one commentary calls a &quot;progress report&quot;.  Just before the geography of the scene shifts to a new location, Luke summarizes how the gospel has impacted that location. The standard for these progress reports is in 2:46&amp;ndash;47, where Luke describes the impact of the gospel on the new church in Jerusalem. The remaining progress reports are located:

Acts 6:7 Impact of the gospel in Jerusalem.
9:31 Impact of the gospel in Judea and Samaria.
12:24 Impact of the gospel in Syria.
16:5 Impact of the gospel in Asia Minor.
19:20 Impact of the gospel in Europe.
28:31 Impact of the gospel on Rome

This structure can be also seen as a series of concentric circles, where the gospel begins in the center, Jerusalem, and is expanding ever outward to Judea &amp; Samaria, Syria, Asia Minor, Europe, and eventually to Rome.

== Date ==
External evidence now points to the existence of Acts at least as early as the opening years of the 2nd century. As evidence for the Third Gospel holds equally for Acts, its existence in [[Marcion]]'s day (120&amp;ndash;140) is now assured.  Further, the traces of it in [[Polycarp]] 6 and [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]] 7 when taken together are highly probable; and it is even widely admitted that the resemblance of Acts 13:22 and [[Epistles of Clement|First Clement]] 18:1, in features not found in [[Psalms]] 89:20 quoted by each, can hardly be accidental. That is, Acts was probably current in Antioch and [[Izmir|Smyrna]] not later than circa 115, and perhaps in Rome as early as circa 96. 

With this view internal evidence agrees. In spite of some advocacy of a date prior to AD 70, the bulk of critical opinion is decidedly against it.  The prologue to Luke's Gospel itself implies the dying out of the generation of eyewitnesses as a class.  A strong consensus supports a date about AD 80; some prefer 75 to 80; while a date between 70 and 75 seems no less possible.  Of the reasons for a date in one of the earlier decades of the 2nd century, as argued by the Tübingen school and its heirs, several are now untenable. Among these are the supposed traces of 2nd-century [[Gnosticism]] and &quot;[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]]&quot; ideas of organization; but especially the argument from the relation of the Roman state to the Christians, which Ramsay has reversed and turned into proof of an origin prior to [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]]'s correspondence with [[Trajan]] on the subject. Another fact, now generally admitted, renders a 2nd-century date yet more incredible; and that is the failure of a writer devoted to Paul's memory to make palpable use of his Epistles. Instead of this he writes in a fashion that seems to traverse certain things recorded in them. If, indeed, it were proved that Acts uses the later works of [[Josephus]], we should have to place the book about AD 100. But this is far from being the case. 

Three points of contact with Josephus in particular are cited. (1) The circumstances attending the death of [[Agrippa I]] in AD 44. Here Acts 12:21&amp;ndash;23 is largely parallel to his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' 19.8.2; but the latter adds an omen of coming doom, while Acts alone gives a circumstantial account of the occasion of Herod's public appearance.  Hence the parallel, when analyzed, tells against dependence on Josephus.  So also with (2) the cause of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] pseudo-prophet in Acts 21:37f. and in Josephus (''[[Jewish War|J.W.]]'' 2.13.5; ''A.J.'' 20.8.6) for the numbers of his followers do not agree with either of Josephus's rather divergent accounts, while Acts alone calls them ''[[Sicarii]]''. With these instances in mind, it is natural to regard (3) the curious resemblance as to the (non-historical) order in which [[Theudas]] and [[Judas of Galilee]] are referred to in both (Acts 5:36f.; ''A.J.'' 20.5.1) as accidental.

It is worth noting, however, that no ancient source actually mentions Acts by name prior to AD 177. If it was composed prior to then, no one spoke of it by that name, or at least no one whose writings have survived down to the present day.

== Place ==
The place of composition is still an open question. For some time Rome and Antioch have been in favor, and [[Friedrich Blass|Blass]] combined both views in his theory of two editions. But internal evidence points strongly to the Roman province of [[Asia Province|Asia]], particularly the neighborhood of [[Ephesus]].  Note the confident local allusion in 19:9 to &quot;the school of Tyrannus&quot; and in 19:33 to &quot;Alexander&quot;; also the very minute topography in 20:13&amp;ndash;15.  At any rate affairs in that region, including the future of the church of Ephesus (20:28&amp;ndash;30), are treated as though they would specially interest &quot;Theophilus&quot; and his circle; also an early tradition makes Luke die in the adjacent [[Bithynia]].  Finally it was in this region that there arose certain early glosses (e.g., 19:9, 20:15), probably the earliest of those referred to below. How fully in correspondence with such an environment the work would be, as apologia for the Church against the Synagogue's attempts to influence Roman policy to its harm, must be clear to all familiar with the strength of Judaism in Asia (cf. [[Revelation|Rev]] 2:9, 3:9; and see Sir W. M. Ramsay, ''The Letters to the Seven Churches'', ch. xii.).

== Text ==
Of the many problems with Acts, perhaps the most complex is that of its text. As with the other books of the New Testament, Acts exists in several text types; however, unlike with the other books, the difference between the [[Alexandrian text-type]] and the [[Western text-type]] is very great; the size of the Western text of Acts (as represented by the [[Codex Bezae]]) is 10% larger than the [[Alexandria|Alexandrian]] (as represented by the [[Codex Sinaiticus]]). Although this issue was first observed in the 17th century, explanations for this difference remain little more than conjectures. Any explanation that reduces the Western text to the product of generations of scribes who showed little care for fidelity to their exemplar ignores the evidence that the Western text's additions and omissions have the same stylistic characteristics as the Alexandrian; that Western text readings in Acts date from early [[Latin]] authors like [[Tertullian]], [[Cyprian]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].

The earliest theory, first espoused by Leclerc in 1684, but restated by Blass in 1895 and others since, explains the Western text as a first draft by the author, while the Alexandrian was a more polished version he subsequently published. The French scholars Boismard and Lamouille, in their extensive study of the text of Acts, have embraced this theory.

In 1914, A.C. Clark espousing the principle ''lectio longior potior'' (which is the opposite of the normal principle used in [[textual criticism]]) has argued that the shorter text was a modification of the original text. The opposite direction, that the Western text of Acts was expanded, was first proposed by G. Salmon in 1897 and recently revised by E. Delebecque, who believes the expansion of the text was performed by Luke at Ephesus after Paul's death.

Despite this ongoing debate, the majority of biblical scholars believes the text of Acts as witnessed in the Alexandrian tradition is the closest to the original, although accepting various isolated readings from the Western text families at different points. This was the conclusion of the text of Acts as printed by [[Brooke Foss Westcott|B.F. Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|F.J.A. Hort]], as well as the most recent edition of Nestle and Aland's authoritative ''[[Novum Testamentum graece]]'' (1993).

{{Template:Ancient Mesopotamia}}
'''Assyria''' in earliest historical times referred to a region on the Upper [[Tigris]] river, named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[Ashur]].  Later, as a nation and Empire, it also came to include roughly the northern half of [[Mesopotamia]] (the southern half being [[Babylonia]]). 

Assyria proper was located in a mountainous region, extending along the Tigris as far as the high Gordiaean or Carduchian mountain range of [[Armenia]], sometimes called the &quot;Mountains of Ashur&quot;.

The Assyrian kings controlled a large kingdom at three different times in history. These are called the Old, Middle, and Neo-Assyrian kingdoms, or periods. The by far most powerful and best-known nation of these periods is the Neo-Assyrian kingdom 911-612 BC.

==Early history==

The most important prehistoric ([[Neolithic]]) site in Assyria is at Tell Hassuna, the center of the [[Hassuna]] culture.

Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. According to some Judeo-Christian traditions, the city of Ashur (also spelled [[Assur]] or Aššur) was founded by Ashur the son of [[Shem]], who was deified by later generations as the city's patron god. 

The upper [[Tigris]] river valley seems to have been ruled from Sumer, Akkad, and northern Babylonia in its earliest stages, being part of [[Sargon the Great]]'s empire. Destroyed by [[barbarian]]s in the [[Gutian period]], it was rebuilt, and ended up being governed as part of the Empire of the [[3rd dynasty of Ur]].  

==Early Assyrian city-states and kingdoms==

The first inscriptions of Assyrian rulers appear after 2000 BC. Assyria then consisted of a number of city states and small [[Semitic]] kingdoms. The foundation of the Assyrian monarchy was traditionally ascribed to [[Zulilu]], who is said to have lived after Bel-kap-kapu (Bel-kapkapi or Belkabi, ca. [[1900 BC]]), the ancestor of [[Shalmaneser I]].

===The city state of Ashur===
The city-state of Ashur had extensive contact with cities on the [[Anatolia]]n plateau. The Assyrians established &quot;merchant colonies&quot; in [[Cappadocia]], e.g., at [[Kanesh]] (modern [[Kültepe]]) circa [[1920 BC]]&amp;ndash;[[1840 BC]] and [[1798 BC]]&amp;ndash;[[1740 BC]]. These colonies, called '''''karum''''', the Akkadian word for 'port', were attached to Anatolian cities, but physically separate, and had special tax status. They must have arisen from a long tradition of trade between Ashur and the Anatolian cities; but no archaeological or written records show this. The trade consisted of metal (perhaps lead or tin; the terminology here is not entirely clear) and textiles from Assyria, that were traded for precious metals in Anatolia.

===The kingdom of Shamshi-Adad I===
The city of Ashur was conquered by [[Shamshi-Adad I]] ([[1813 BC]]&amp;ndash;[[1791 BC]]) in the expansion of [[Amorite]] tribes from the [[Khabur river]] delta. He put his son [[Ishme-Dagan]] on the throne of nearby city Ekallatum, and allowed the former Anatolian trade to continue. Shamshi-Adad I also conquered the kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] on the [[Euphrates]] and put another of his sons, Yasmah-Adad on the throne there. Shamshi-Adad's kingdom now encompassed the whole of northern Mesopotamia. He himself resided in a new capital city founded in the Khabur valley, called [[Shubat-Enlil]]. Ishme-Dagan inherited the kingdom, but Yasmah-Adad was overthrown and Mari was lost. The new king of Mari allied himself with [[Hammurabi]] of [[Babylon]]. Assyria now faced the rising power of Babylon in the south. Ishme-Dagan responded by making an alliance with the enemies of Babylon, and the power struggle continued for decades.

===Assyria reduced to vassal states===
Hammurabi eventually prevailed over Ishme-Dagan, and conquered Ashur for Babylon. With Hammurabi, the various ''karum'' in Anatolia ceased trade activity &amp;mdash; probably because the goods of Assyria were now being traded with the Babylonians' partners.

Assyria was ruled by vassal kings dependent on the Babylonians for a century. After Babylon fell to the [[Kassites]], the [[Hurrians]] dominated the northern region, including Ashur.

== The Middle Assyrian period ==

(Scholars variously date the beginning of the &quot;Middle Assyrian period&quot; to either the fall of the Old Assyrian kingdom of [[Shamshi-Adad I]], or to when [[Ashur-uballit I]] ascended to the throne of Assyria.)

===Ashur-uballit I===
In the [[15th century BC]], [[Saushtatar]], king of &quot;''Hanilgalbat''&quot; (Hurrians of [[Mitanni]]), sacked Ashur and made Assyria a vassal. Assyria paid tribute to Hanilgalbat until Mitanni power collapsed from [[Hittites|Hittite]] pressure, enabling [[Ashur-uballit I]] ([[1365 BC]]&amp;ndash;[[1330 BC]]), to again make Assyria an independent and conquering power at the expense of [[Babylonia]]; and a time came when the Kassite king in Babylon was glad to marry the daughter of Ashur-uballit, whose letters to [[Akhenaten]] of [[Egypt]] form part of the [[Amarna letters]]. This marriage led to disastrous results, as the Kassite faction at court murdered the Babylonian king and placed a pretender on the throne. Assur-uballit promptly marched into Babylonia and avenged his son-in-law, making [[Kurigalzu]] of the royal line king there.

===Assyrian expansion===
Hanilgalbat was finally conquered under [[Adad-nirari I]], who described himself as a &quot;Great-King&quot; (''Sharru rabû'') in letters to the Hittite rulers. Adad-nirari I's successor, [[Shalmaneser I]] (c. 1300 BC), threw off the pretense of Babylonian suzerainty, made [[Calah]] his capital, and followed up on expansion to the northwest, mainly at the expense of the Hittites, reaching as far as [[Carchemish]] and beyond.  

Shalmaneser's son and successor, [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]], deposed Kadashman-Buriash of Babylon and ruled there himself as king for seven years, taking on the old title &quot;king of Sumer and Akkad&quot;.  Following this, Babylon revolted against Tukulti-Ninurta, and later even made Assyria tributary during the reigns of the Babylonian kings Melishipak II and Marduk-apal-iddin I, another weak period for Assyria.

===Tiglath-Pileser I reaches the Mediterranean Sea===

As the Hittite empire collapsed from onslaught of the [[Phrygians]] (called [[Meshech|Mushki]] in Assyrian annals), Babylon and Assyria began to vie for [[Amorite]] regions, formerly under firm Hittite control.  The Assyrian king [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] defeated [[Nebuchadnezzar I]] of Babylon in a battle, when their forces encountered one another in this region.

Ashur-resh-ishi's son, [[Tiglath-Pileser I]], may be regarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. In [[1120 BC]], he crossed the [[Euphrates]], capturing Carchemish, defeated the Mushki and the remnants of the Hittites&amp;mdash;even claiming to reach the [[Black Sea]]&amp;mdash;and advanced to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], subjecting [[Phoenicia]], where he hunted wild bulls. He also marched into Babylon twice, assuming the old title &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot;, although he was unable to depose the actual king in Babylonia, where the old Kassite dynasty had now succumbed to an Elamite one.

===The Society in the Middle Assyrian period===

Assyria had a major problem in keeping the trade routes open. Unlike the situation in the Old Assyrian period, the Anatolian metal trade was effectively cut off by the [[Hittites]] and the [[Hurrians]]. They also controlled the Mediterrenean ports while the [[Kassites]] controlled the river route south to the [[Persian Gulf]].

The Middle Assyrian kingdom was well organized and in firm control by the king. The king also functioned as the High Priest of [[Anshar|Ashur]], the state god. He had certain obligations to fulfil in the cult, and to provide rich resources for the temples. The priesthood became a major power in the Assyrian society. Conflicts with the priesthood probably laid behind the murder of king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]].

The population of Assyria was rather small and the main cities were [[Assur|Ashur]], [[Kalhu]] and [[Nineveh]], all situated in the [[Tigris]] river valley. All free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time; this system was called the ''ilku''-service. The [[Babylonian law|Middle Assyrian laws]] were compiled during this period. They are notable of the repressive attitude towards women in the society.

==Neo-Assyrian Empire==
[[Image:Map of Assyria.png|thumb|300ppx|Assyrian Empire]]
===Assyrian empire-building===

After Tiglath-Pileser I, the Assyrians were in decline for nearly two centuries, a time of weak and ineffective rulers, wars with neighboring [[Urartu]], and encroachments by Aramaean nomads.  This long period of weakness ended with the accession in [[911 BC]] of [[Adad-nirari II]]. He brought the areas still nominally under Assyrian vassalage firmly under subjection, deporting populations in the north to far-off places.  Apart from pushing the boundary with Babylonia slightly southward, he did not engage in actual expansion, and the borders of the empire he consolidated reached only as far west as the Khabur.  He was succeeded by Tukulti-Ninurta II, who made some gains in the north during his short reign.

The next king, [[Ashurnasirpal II]] ([[883 BC]]&amp;ndash;[[858 BC]]), embarked on a vast program of merciless expansion, first terrorizing the peoples to the north as far as Nairi, then subjecting the Aramaeans between the Khabur and the Euphrates.  His harshness prompted a revolt that was crushed decisively in a pitched, two-day battle.  Following this victory, he advanced without opposition as far as the Mediterranean and exacted tribute from [[Phoenicia]]. Unlike any before, the Assyrians began boasting in their ruthlessness around this time. Ashurnasirpal II also moved his capital to the city of Kalhu ([[Nimrud]]). The palaces, temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable development of wealth and art.

[There is ongoing discussion among academics over the nature of the [[Nimrud lens]], a piece of [[rock crystal]] unearthed by [[John Layard]] in [[1850]], in the Nimrud palace complex in northern [[Iraq]]. A small minority believe that it is evidence for the existence of ancient Assyrian telescopes, which could explain the great accuracy of Assyrian astronomy.]  

Ashurnasirpal's son, [[Shalmaneser III]] (858 BC&amp;ndash;[[823 BC]]), had a long reign of 34 years, when the Assyrian capital was converted into an armed camp. Each year the Assyrian armies marched out of it to plunder and destroy. Babylon was occupied, and Babylonia reduced to vassalage. He fought against Urartu, and  marched an army against an allied army of Syrian states headed by [[Benhadad]] of [[Damascus]], and including [[Ahab]], king of [[Kingdom of Israel|Israel]], at the [[Battle of Karkar]] in ([[854 BC]]). Despite Shalmaneser's description of 'vanquishing the opposition', it seems that the battle ended in a deadlock, as the Assyrian forces were withdrawn soon afterwards. 

Shalmaneser retook Carchemish in [[849 BC]], and in [[841 BC]] marched an army against [[Hazael]], King of Damascus, besieging and taking that city. He also brought under tribute [[Jehu]] of Israel, [[Tyre]], and [[Sidon]]. His black [[obelisk]], discovered at Kalhu, records many military exploits of his reign. [http://www.kchanson.com/ANCDOCS/meso/obelisk.html] The last few years of his life were disturbed by the rebellion of his eldest son, that nearly proved fatal. Assur, Arbela and other places joined the pretender, and the revolt was quashed with difficulty by [[Shamshi-Adad V]], Shalmaneser's second son, who soon afterwards succeeded him (824 BC). 

In the following century, Assyria again experienced a relative decline, owing to weaker rulers (including the Queen [[Semiramis]]) and a resurgence in expansion by Urartu.  The notable exception was [[Adad-nirari III]] ([[810 BC]]&amp;ndash;[[782 BC]]), who captured Damascus in 804, bringing Syria under tribute as far south as Samaria and [[Edom]], and who advanced against the [[Medes]], perhaps even penetrating to the [[Caspian Sea]].

===Second Assyrian Empire===
When [[Nabonassar]] began the neo-Babylonian dynasty in [[747 BC]] Assyria was in the throes of a revolution. Civil war and pestilence were devastating the country, and its northern provinces had been wrested from it by Urartu. In 746 BC Calah joined the rebels, and on the 13th of ''Iyyar'' in the following year, a general named [[Pulu]], who took the name of [[Tiglath-pileser III]], seized the crown, and made sweeping changes to the Assyrian government, considerably improving its efficiency and security. 

The conquered provinces were organized under an elaborate bureaucracy, with the king at the head &amp;mdash; each district paying a fixed tribute and providing a military contingent. The Assyrian forces at this time became a standing army, that by successive improvements became an irresistible fighting machine; and Assyrian policy was henceforth directed toward reducing the whole civilized world into a single empire, throwing its trade and wealth into Assyrian hands. These changes are often identified as the beginning of the &quot;Second Assyrian Empire&quot;. 

After subjecting Babylon to tribute, severely punishing Urartu, and defeating the Medes and Hittites, Tiglath-Pileser III directed his armies into Syria, which had regained its independence, and the commercially successful Mediterranean seaports of Phoenicia. He took [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]] near [[Aleppo]] in [[740 BC]] after a siege of three years, and reduced [[Hamath]]. Azariah (Uzziah) had been an ally of the king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by Tiglath-Pileser to do him homage and pay yearly tribute.  

In [[738 BC]], in the reign of [[Menahem]], king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser III occupied [[Philistines|Philistia]] and invaded Israel, imposing on it a heavy tribute (2 Kings 15:19). [[Ahaz]], king of Judah, engaged in a war against Israel and Syria, appealed for help to this Assyrian king by means of a present of gold and silver (2 Kings 16:8); he accordingly &quot;marched against Damascus, defeated and put Rezin to death, and besieged the city itself.&quot; Leaving part of his army to continue the siege, he advanced, ravaging with fire and sword the province east of the Jordan, Philistia, and [[Samaria]]; and in [[732 BC]] took Damascus, deporting its inhabitants to Assyria. In [[729 BC]], he had himself crowned as &quot;King Pul of Babylon&quot;.

Tiglath-Pileser III died in [[727 BC]], and was succeeded by [[Shalmaneser V]], who reorganized the Empire into provinces, replacing troublesome vassal kings with Assyrian governors. However, King Hoshea of Israel suspended paying tribute, and allied himself with [[Egypt]] against Assyria in [[725 BC]].  This led Shalmaneser to invade Syria (2 Kings 17:5) and besiege Samaria (capital city of Israel) for three years.

===Sargonid (dynasty)===
[[Image:Deportationofjewsbyassyrian.jpg|thumb|right|Deportation of Jews from Judah by the Assyrian Empire]]
Shalmaneser V died suddenly in [[722 BC]] while seiging Samaria, and the throne was seized by in favour of [[Sargon II of Assyria|Sargon]], the ''Tartan'' (commander-in-chief of the army), who then quickly took Samaria, effectively ending the northern [[Kingdom of Israel]] and carrying 27,000 people away into captivity into the [[Israelite Diaspora]]. (2 Kings 17:1&amp;ndash;6, 24; 18:7, 9). He also overran Judah, and besieged Jerusalem (Isa. 10:6, 12, 22, 24, 34), but did not capture it. In [[721 BC]], Babylon threw off the rule of the Assyrians, under the powerful Chaldean prince [[Merodach-baladan]] (2 Kings 20:12), and Sargon, unable to contain the revolt, turned his attention again to Urartu and Syria, taking [[Carchemish]] in 717, as well as the Medes, penetrating the Iranian Plateau as far as Mt. Bikni and building several fortresses, before returning in [[710 BC]] and retaking Babylon.  Sargon also built a new capital at [[Dur Sharrukin]] (&quot;Sargon's City&quot;) near Nineveh, with all the tribute Assyria had collected from various nations.

In [[705 BC]], Sargon was slain while fighting the [[Cimmerians]], and was succeeded by his son [[Sennacherib]] (2 Kings 18:13; 19:37; Isa. 7:17, 18), who moved the capital to Nineveh and made the deported peoples work on improving Nineveh's system of irrigation canals.  In [[701 BC]], Hezekiah of Judah formed an alliance with Egypt against Assyria, so Sennacherib accordingly marched toward Jerusalem, destroying 46 villages in his path.  This is graphically described in Isaiah 10; exactly what happened next is unclear (the Bible says an Angel of the Lord smote the Assyrian army at Jerusalem; [[Herodotus]] says they were destroyed by a plague of field mice at Egypt; Sennacherib's account says Judah paid him tribute and he left); however what is certain, is that the besieging army was somehow decimated, and Sennacherib failed to capture Jerusalem. In [[689 BC]], Babylonia again revolted, but Sennacherib responded swiftly by opening the canals around Babylon and flooding the outside of the city until it became a [[swamp]], resulting in its destruction, and its inhabitants were scattered. In [[681 BC]], Sennacherib was murdered, most likely by one of his sons.

Sennacherib was succeeded by his son [[Esarhaddon]] (''Ashur-aha-iddina''), who had been governor of Babylonia, and was campaigning in Urartu at the time of his father's murder, where he won a victory at [[Malatia]] (Milid). As king, he immediately had Babylon rebuilt, and made it his capital. Defeating the Cimmerians and Medes (again penetrating to Mt. Bikni), but unable to maintain order in these areas, he turned his attention westward to Phoenicia&amp;mdash;now allying itself with Egypt against him&amp;mdash;and sacked Sidon in [[677 BC]]. He also captured [[Manasseh]] of Judah and kept him prisoner for some time in Babylon (2 Kings 19:37; Isa. 37:38). Having had enough of Egyptian meddling, he next invaded that country in [[674 BC]], conquering it all with a cast force in [[670 BC]]. The [[pharoah]] [[Tirhakah]] fled Egypt, and a stele commemorating the victory, and representing Tirhakah with black African features, was set up at Sinjirli (north of the Gulf of Antioch), and is now in the Berlin Museum.  Assyria was also at war with Urartu and [[Dilmun]] (probably modern [[Qatar]]) at this time. This was Assyria's greatest territorial extent.  However, the Assyrian governors Esarhaddon had appointed over Egypt were obliged to flee the restive populace, and while leading another army to pacify them, Esarhaddon died suddenly, in [[669 BC]].

[[Assur-bani-pal]] or Ashurbanipal (''Ashurbanapli, Asnappar''), the son of [[Esarhaddon]], succeeded him. He continued to campaign in Egypt, when not distracted by pressures from the Medes to the east, and Cimmerians to the north of Assyria. Unable to contain Egypt, he installed Psammetichus as a vassal king in [[663 BC]]. However, after [[Gyges of Lydia]]'s appeal for Assyrian help against the Cimmerians was rejected, Lydian mercenaries were sent to Psammetichus. By [[652 BC]], this vassal king was strong enough to declare outright independence from Assyria with impunity, especially as Ashurbanipal's older brother, [[Shamash-shum-ukin]], governor of Babylon, began a civil war in that year. This rebellion lasted until [[648 BC]], when Babylon was sacked, and Shamash-shum-ukin set fire to the palace, killing himself.  Elam was completely devastated in [[646 BC]] and [[640 BC]], and its capital Susa completely leveled.

===Downfall and heritage===
Ashurbanipal had promoted art and culture, and had a vast library of cuneiform tablets at Nineveh. However, his long struggle with Babylonia and Elam left Assyria maimed and exhausted. It had been drained of wealth and fighting population; the devastated provinces could yield nothing to supply the needs of the imperial exchequer, and it was difficult to find sufficient troops to garrison the conquered populations. Assyria, therefore, was ill-prepared to face the hordes of [[Scythians]] and Medes who now began to harass the frontiers to the east; Asia Minor too was infested by the Cimmerians.

Upon Ashurbanipal's death in [[627 BC]], the empire began to disintegrate rapidly. The Scythians, Cimmerians and Medes immediately penetrated the borders, marauding as far as Egypt, while Babylonia again became independent; Ashurbanipal's successor, [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], seems to have exercised little real power. The Babylonian king [[Nabopolassar]], along with [[Cyaxares]] the Mede, finally destroyed Nineveh in [[612 BC]], and Assyria fell. A general called Ashur-uballit II, with military support from the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Necho]] II, held out as a remnant of Assyrian power at [[Harran]] until [[609 BC]], after which Assyria ceased to exist as an independent nation.

==Assyrian Art==
[[Image:Human headed winged bull facing.jpg|thumb|right|An Assyrian winged bull.]]
Assyrian art preserved to the present day predominantly dates to the Neo-Assyrian period. Art depicting battle scenes, and occasionally the impaling of whole villages in gory detail, was intended to show the power of the emperor, and was generally made for propaganda purposes. These stone reliefs lined the walls in the royal palaces where foreigners were received by the king. Other stone reliefs depict the king with different deities and conducting religious ceremonies. A lot of stone reliefs were discovered in the royal palaces at [[Nimrud]] (Kalhu) and [[Khorsabad]] (Dur-Sharrukin). A rare discovery of metal plates belonging to wooden doors were made at [[Balawat]] (Imgur-Enlil).

Assyrian sculpture reached a high level of refinement in the Neo-Assyrian period. One prominent example is the winged bull ''Lamasu'', or [[shedu]] that guard the entrances to the king's court. These were apotrophaic meaning they were intended to ward off evil.

Since works of precious gems and metals usually not survive time, we are lucky to have some fine pieces of Assyrian jewellery. These were found in royal tombs at Nimrud.

== The Legacy of Assyria ==

The Assyrians themselves were not the greatest innovators in science and culture, but they carried on the cultural heritage from the Old Babylonian period. Much of the Babylonian literature, with roots in the Sumerian civilization, is preserved from the Assyrian library of [[Ashur-bani-pal]]. The Assyrians also studied astrology, which they used for interpretation of omens. They also achieved much in the field of engineering, and Assyrian dams and canals are still in function to this day.

'''Aphasia''' is a loss or impairment of the ability to produce and/or comprehend [[language]], due to [[brain damage]]. It is usually a result of damage to the language centres of the brain (like [[Broca's area]]).  These areas are almost always located in the  [[left hemisphere]], and in most people this is where the ability to produce and comprehend language is found.  However in a very small number of people language ability is found in the right hemisphere.  Damage to these language areas can be caused by a [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]] or other [[head injury]].  Aphasia may also develop slowly, as in the case of a [[brain tumor]]. Depending on the area and extent of the damage, someone suffering from aphasia may be able to speak but not write, or vice versa, understand more complex sentences than he or she can produce, or display any of a wide variety of other deficiencies in reading, writing, and comprehension.   

Aphasia may co-occur with speech disorders such as [[dysarthria]]  or [[apraxia]] of speech, which also result from brain damage. 

The brains of young children with brain damage sometimes restructure themselves to use different areas for speech processing, and regain lost function; adult brains are less &quot;plastic&quot; and lack this ability.

Aphasia can be assessed in a variety of ways, from quick clinical screening at the bedside to several-hour-long batteries of tasks that examine the key components of language and communication.

==Who has aphasia?==
Anyone can acquire aphasia, but most people who have aphasia are in their middle to late years. Men and women are equally affected. It is estimated that approximately 80,000 individuals in the [[United States]] acquire aphasia each year. About one million persons in the United States currently have aphasia.

==Causes==
Aphasia can be caused by damage to one or more of the language areas of the brain. Many times, the cause of the brain injury is a [[stroke]]. A stroke occurs when, for some reason, blood is unable to reach a part of the brain. Brain cells die when they do not receive their normal supply of blood, which carries oxygen and important nutrients. Other causes of brain injury are severe blows to the head, brain tumors, brain infections, and other conditions of the brain.

Traumatic aphasia can occur without physical damage to the brain, but by experiencing a horrific event (normally during childhood). Treatment for traumatic aphasia is wildly different, normally requiring the help of a psychologist. And as the patient grows older, the chances of recovery gradually decline.

Individuals with [[Broca's aphasia]] have damage to the frontal lobe of the brain. These individuals frequently speak in short, meaningful phrases that are produced with great effort. Broca's aphasia is thus characterized as a nonfluent aphasia. Affected people often omit small words such as &quot;is,&quot; &quot;and,&quot; and &quot;the.&quot; For example, a person with Broca's aphasia may say, &quot;Walk dog&quot; meaning, &quot;I will take the dog for a walk.&quot; The same sentence could also mean &quot;You take the dog for a walk,&quot; or &quot;The dog walked out of the yard,&quot; depending on the circumstances. Individuals with Broca's aphasia are able to understand the speech of others to varying degrees. Because of this, they are often aware of their difficulties and can become easily frustrated by their speaking problems. Individuals with Broca's aphasia often have [[right-sided weakness]] or paralysis of the arm and leg because the frontal lobe is also important for body movement.

In contrast to Broca's aphasia, damage to the [[temporal lobe]] may result in a fluent aphasia that is called [[Wernicke's aphasia]]. Individuals with Wernicke's aphasia may speak in long sentences that have no meaning, add unnecessary words, and even create new &quot;words.&quot; For example, someone with Wernicke's aphasia may say, &quot;You know that smoodle pinkered and that I want to get him round and take care of him like you want before,&quot; meaning &quot;The dog needs to go out so I will take him for a walk.&quot; Individuals with Wernicke's aphasia usually have great difficulty understanding speech and are therefore often unaware of their mistakes. These individuals usually have no body weakness because their brain injury is not near the parts of the brain that control movement.

A third type of aphasia, global aphasia, results from damage to extensive portions of the language areas of the brain. Individuals with global aphasia have severe communication difficulties and will be extremely limited in their ability to speak or comprehend language.

==Diagnosis==
Aphasia is usually first recognized by the physician who treats the individual for his or her brain injury. Frequently this is a [[neurologist]]. The physician typically performs tests that require the individual to follow commands, answer questions, name objects, and converse. If the physician suspects aphasia, the individual is often referred to a [[speech-language pathologist]], who performs a comprehensive examination of the person's ability to understand, speak, read, and write.

==Treatment==
In some instances an individual will completely recover from aphasia without treatment. This type of &quot;spontaneous recovery&quot; usually occurs following a [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA), a kind of [[stroke]] in which the blood flow to the brain is temporarily interrupted but quickly restored. In these circumstances, language abilities may return within a few hours or a few days. For most cases of aphasia, however, language recovery is not as quick or as complete. While many individuals with aphasia also experience a period of partial spontaneous recovery (in which some language abilities return over a period of a few days to a month after the brain injury), some amount of aphasia typically remains. In these instances, speech-language therapy is often helpful. Recovery usually continues over a 2-year period. Most people believe that the most effective treatment begins early in the recovery process. Some of the factors that influence the amount of improvement include the cause of the brain damage, the area of the brain that was damaged, the extent of the brain injury, and the age and health of the individual. Additional factors include motivation, handedness, and educational level.

Aphasia therapy, provided by the speech and language therapist, strives to improve an individual's ability to communicate by helping the person to use remaining abilities, to restore language abilities as much as possible, to compensate for language problems, and to learn other methods of communicating. Treatment may be offered in individual or group settings. Individual therapy focuses on the specific needs of the person, and should concentrate on the unique language problems and their effects on the client's ability to participate in every day life. Further, support, advice and information should be available to spouses and significant others, who have to come to terms with an often dramatic change in the person with aphasia.  Group therapy offers the opportunity to use new communication skills in a comfortable setting. Stroke clubs, which are regional support groups formed by individuals who have had a stroke, are available in most major cities in the U.S.A. These clubs also offer the opportunity for individuals with aphasia to try new communication skills. In addition, stroke clubs can help the individual and his or her family adjust to the life changes that accompany stroke and aphasia. Family involvement is often a crucial component of aphasia treatment so that family members can learn the best way to communicate with their loved one.

== What research is being done for aphasia? ==
Aphasia research is exploring new ways to evaluate and treat aphasia as well as to further understanding of the function of the brain. [[Neuroimaging]] techniques are helping to define brain function, determine the severity of brain damage, and predict the severity of the aphasia. These procedures include PET ([[positron emission tomography]]), CT ([[computed tomography]]), and MRI ([[magnetic resonance imaging]]) as well as the new [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), which identifies areas of the brain that are used during activities such as speaking or listening. In-depth testing of the language ability of individuals with the various aphasic syndromes is helping to design effective treatment strategies. The use of computers in aphasia treatment is being studied. Promising new drugs administered shortly after some types of stroke are being investigated as ways to reduce the severity of aphasia.

== Types of aphasia ==
Any of the following can be considered aphasia:
* inability to comprehend speech
* inability to read ([[alexia (disorder)|alexia]])
* inability to write ([[agraphia]])
* inability to speak, without muscle paralysis
* inability to form words
* inability to name objects ([[anomia]])
* poor [[enunciation]]
* excessive creation and use of personal [[neologism]]s ([[jargon aphasia]])
* inability to repeat a phrase
* persistent repetition of phrases
* other language impairment

The common types of aphasia are 
*[[Broca's aphasia]] ([[expressive aphasia]])
*[[Wernicke's aphasia]] ([[receptive aphasia]])
*[[Nominal aphasia]] ([[anomic aphasia]])

==Aphasia in popular culture==
Aphasia has sometimes been used as an avenue by which writers can explore the concept of human communication. For example, the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode &quot;[[MemoryAlpha:Babel (episode)|Babel]]&quot; features an aphasia virus, which slowly but steadily infects the population of a [[space station]] and causes them to say random words in place of what they mean to say. The play ''[[Fuddy Meers]]'' also explores this idea, albeit in an unusual way; the main character, Claire, is an [[amnesia]]c whose life is one discovery after another, and her kidnapper's mother, who has suffered a stroke and become aphasic, is the only one who knows the full truth about Claire's situation. The title of the play is based on the mother's pronunciation of the phrase &quot;funny mirrors&quot;, in reference to mirrors frequently seen on [[funhouse]] walls, and is a metaphor for the way the play is told and the manner in which we experience day-to-day life.

The largest [[artery]] in the [[human body]], the '''aorta''' originates from the [[left ventricle]] of the [[heart]] and brings oxygenated blood to all parts of the body in the [[systemic circulation]].

==The course of the aorta==
The aorta is usually divided into several segments.  The portion above the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] (in the [[thorax]]) is called the ''[[thoracic aorta]]'' and is sometimes further subdivided into the ''ascending aorta'', ''aortic arch'' and ''descending (thoracic) aorta''.  The portion below the diaphragm (in the [[abdomen]]) is known as the ''[[abdominal aorta]]''. 

==Features==
The aorta is an elastic artery, and as such is quite distensible. When the left ventricle contracts to force blood into the aorta, the aorta expands. This stretching gives the potential energy that will help maintain blood pressure during [[diastole]], as during this time the aorta contracts passively.

#The name of a king of Gerar which is mentioned in two of the three stories of [[a wife confused for a sister]]. 
#[[Abimelech (Judges)]], a son of [[Gideon (Judges)|Gideon]] ([[book of Judges|Judges]] 9:1), who was proclaimed king after the death of his father ([[Judges]] 8:33-9:6). 
#The son of [[Abiathar]], and high priest in the time of [[David]] ([[1 Chronicles]] 18:16). In the parallel passage, [[2 Samuel]] 8:17, we have the name Ahimelech, and Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech. This most authorities consider the more correct reading. 
#The king of [[Gath]], better known as [[Achish]], as it appears in the title of [[Psalm]] 34. He's also referred to as [[Achimelech]] (See also [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 21:10-15.)

==Abimelech's name==
Abimelech's name has three main translations, though none treats the name as being completely Hebrew, and all are slightly contorted. The first is ''my father is king'', which could be considered simply as a generic title given to a crown prince. The other two are more interesting, both essentially being ''my father is MLK'', with [[Moloch|MLK]] being the reference found elsewhere in the bible in prohibitions such as ''do not pass your children through the fire to MLK'', in which case one of the two following possibilities arises
*Either MLK refers to a major Canaanite deity probably named ''Moloch'', i.e. ''Abimelech'' being ''my father is Moloch'' - a reference to belief in semi-divine kings, such as Abimelech
*Or MLK refers to a type of (probably human) sacrifice probably named ''Molk'', i.e. ''Abimelech'' being roughly ''my father is a sacrifice'' - a reference to Abimelech being pious

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anomalous cognition''' is a general term describing a transfer of information to a subject through currently unknown means.
It fits descriptions of [[telepathy]], [[extra-sensory perception]], [[clairvoyance]], [[precognition]] and other &quot;perceptive&quot; [[paranormal]] abilities.  The term ''anomalous cognition'' is used by [[parapsychologists]] to reference awareness of information without having to specify or theorize a particular means by which that information was transferred.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andrew &quot;Tridge&quot; Tridgell''' (born [[February 28]], [[1967]]) is an [[Australia|Australian]] [[computer programmer]], living in [[Canberra]], in the [[Australian Capital Territory]].

Born in [[Sydney]], Andrew is the initial author of and frequent contributor to the [[Samba software|Samba]] [[file server]], and co-inventor of the [[rsync]] algorithm.

He is best known for his analysis of complex [[proprietary]] [[protocol (computing)|protocols]] and [[algorithm]]s, to allow compatible [[free software]] implementations.  In [[2006]], he was awarded the [[FSF Award for the Advancement of Free Software]] for his software work.

== Projects ==
He was a major developer of the Samba software, analysing the [[Server message block|Server Message Block]] protocol used for [[workgroup]] and network file sharing by [[Microsoft Windows]] products. He developed the [[talloc]] hierarchical memory allocator, originally as part of Samba.

He co-developed [[rsync]], including the rsync algorithm, a highly efficient [[file transfer]] and [[data synchronization]] tool.

He was also a leader in [[hacker|hacking]] the [[TiVo]] to make it work in Australia, which uses the [[PAL]] video format.

He also was the original author of [[rzip]], which uses a similar algorithm to rsync, the subject of his PhD thesis.

In April 2005, Andrew's effort to produce free software that interoperated with the [[BitKeeper]] source code repository was a source of [[controversy]], cited as the reason that BitMover revoked the license that allowed its free use for the [[Linux]] kernel. This resulted in a messy public falling-out between Tridgell and [[Linus Torvalds]], in which Tridgell stated that he had never had a BitKeeper license so he couldn't violate it and had acted entirely ethically in analysing and implementing the protocol, something he'd previously done with the Samba protocol. Network protocol analysis is completely legal, even though often mistakenly confused with reverse engineering. See Tridge's [http://samba.org/ftp/tridge/misc/french_cafe.txt French Cafe] article for more information.

== Academic achievements ==
He completed a [[science degree]] with majors in [[applied mathematics]] and [[physics]] at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1988, before moving to [[Canberra]] to complete an [[Honours degree]] at the [[Australian National University]], in which he received first class honours in [[theoretical physics]].

Andrew went on to complete a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at the Computer Sciences Laboratory of the [[Australian National University]]. His original doctorate work was in the area of [[speech recognition]] but was never completed. His submitted thesis, on &quot;Efficient Algorithms for Sorting and Synchronization&quot;, was based on his work on the rsync algorithm. (link to thesis below)

== Employment ==
Andrew started his career working for a company named Efam Resources from 1987 to 1988, designing [[computer modeling|computer models]] of [[financial markets]]. His work led to Andrew developing a product named The Options Analyst, which he marketed and sold for 5 years.

From 1988 to 1989, Andrew worked as a software developer for a company named Sonartech Pty Ltd (now Sonartech Atlas), which developed [[sonar]] technologies for Australian [[submarine]]s. Andrew was involved in developing [[passive sonar]] technology.

Between 1989 and 1990, Andrew was employed to develop software for the Research School of Biological Sciences in the Australian National University, creating computer models of physical and biological events and environments such as bushfire spread and [[population dynamics]].

From 1991 to 1999, Andrew held various other positions at the Australian National University, such as [[Unix|UNIX]] administration, [[satellite]] control, and [[supercomputer]] research.  During this period he was seconded to the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Computational Systems (CRC for ACSys) where he headed the PIOuS (Parallel Input/Output System) project - later HiDIOS (High-performance Distributed Input/Output System) - for parallel file systems on the Fujitsu AP1000 and AP+ supercomputers. Andrew also went on to lecture, first as an associate lecturer, and then as a casual lecturer, in the university's Computer Science division. He remains a Visiting Fellow of the University.

In mid-1999, Andrew joined the [[Linuxcare]] company's office in Canberra as their first Australian employee. He helped to assemble 14 staff for a research and development team. [[Linux]] and open-source companies were quite a new concept at this stage. Andrew was made a research fellow of Linuxcare in 2000.

In March 2001, Andrew joined [[VA Software|VA Linux Systems]], the second high-profile company to base their business model on the open-source community model. Andrew worked in the [[network attached storage]] division for VA Linux Systems, making enhancements to Samba and the [[Linux kernel]] to provide enhanced performance for their network-attached storage device range.

Andrew continued his work with network-attached storage technologies when he joined [[Quantum Corporation]] as a Senior Engineer in the Systems Storage Group. His role once again involved developing functionality and efficiency modifications into Samba to enhance Quantum's Guardian network-attached storage device range. One of the features that he added to Samba at this time was support for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Active Directory]] technology, a new authentication system introduced with Microsoft's [[Windows 2000|Windows 2000 Server]] product range.

In 2004, Andrew was employed by [[IBM]] working remotely for the [[Almaden Research Center]]. He left in January 2005 to become an appointed fellow at [[OSDL]] in order to lead development on version 4 of Samba.

==Awards==
* In January [[2006]], the [[Free Software Foundation]] awarded Tridgel its '''[[2005]] [[FSF Award for the Advancement of Free Software]]''', for his work on Samba, the Linux kernel, and rsync. Tridgell was considered to have furthered an important goal of the free software movement since the founding of [[GNU]], analyzing ways for free software to interact with widespread proprietary systems to allow people to more easily move away from those systems.

      <comment>[[Category:Microsoft BASIC]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Applesoft BASIC''' was the second dialect of [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] supplied on the [[Apple II family|Apple II]] computer, superseding [[Integer BASIC]]. Applesoft BASIC was supplied by [[Microsoft]]; Apple was looking for a new version of BASIC for the '''Apple II Plus''' computer with 48 [[kilobyte|KB]] of [[random access memory|RAM]], and after their success with [[Altair BASIC]], Microsoft had become the BASIC vendor of choice. Apple licensed a 10 KB [[assembly language]] version of BASIC called &quot;Applesoft.&quot; It was similar to (and indeed shared a common code base with) BASIC implementations on other [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]]-based computers, such as [[Commodore BASIC]]: it used line numbers, spaces were not necessary in lines. While it was much slower than Integer BASIC, it had some killer features that the older BASIC lacked:

* Atomic strings. A string is no longer an array of characters (like in [[C programming language|C]]); it is instead a [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage-collected]] object (like in [[Scheme programming language|Scheme]] and [[Java programming language|Java]]). This allows for string arrays; &lt;code&gt;DIM A$(10)&lt;/code&gt; resulted in a [[vector (computing)|vector]] of ten string variables.
* Multidimensional arrays.
* Single-precision [[floating point]] variables with an 8-bit exponent and a 31-bit significand and improved math capabilities, including a trigonometry library.
* Commands for high-resolution graphics.
* &lt;code&gt;CHR$, ASC, STR$,&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;VAL&lt;/code&gt; functions for converting between string and numeric types
* &lt;code&gt;LET&lt;/code&gt; statement optional
* User defined functions (just simple one-line functions with simple parameters written in BASIC).
* Error-trapping, allowing BASIC programs to handle unexpected errors by means of a subroutine written in BASIC.

Relatively few [[action game]]s were written in Applesoft BASIC, for several reasons:

* In this era of carefully counting clock cycles and limited memory, it was silly to write speed-dependent programs that ran on a runtime interpreter.
* The use of real numbers for all math operations created unnecessary overhead and degraded performance. Applesoft actually converted integer numbers to real before performing operations on them them, then converted them back to integers if necessary. Microsoft did not [[Optimization (computer science)|optimize]] this.
* So-called [[shape table]]s are a slow alternative to [[bitmap]]s. No provision existed for mixing text and graphics, except for the limited &quot;Hardware split screen&quot; of the Apple II (four lines of text at the bottom of the screen). Many graphics programs thus contained  their own bitmap character generator routines. No provision was added in the 128 KB [[Apple IIe]] and [[Apple IIc]] models' BASIC interpreters for the new machines' extra memory and double-resolution graphics, or for the [[Apple IIgs|Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;]]'s 16-color mode. ([[Beagle Bros]] offered machine-language workarounds for these problems.)
* The program was stored as a [[linked list]] of lines; a &lt;code&gt;[[GOTO]]&lt;/code&gt; took [[Computational complexity theory|O(n) (linear) time]], and although Applesoft programs were not very long compared to today's software, on a 1 MHz 6502 this could be a significant bottleneck.
* No sound support aside from a PEEK command that could be used to click the speaker. The language was not fast enough to produce more than a baritone buzz from repeated clicks anyway. However, compiled assembly language was fast enough, and music spanning several octaves could be played by repeated calls to a machine-language tone generator.
* The [[closed source movement]] was just beginning; software publishers found it was harder to crack a machine-language binary than an interpreted source.

Here's [[Hello World]] in Applesoft BASIC:

 10 TEXT:HOME
 20 ?&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;

Multiple commands could be included on the same line of code if seperated by a colon (:).  The ? can be used in Applesoft BASIC as a shortcut for &quot;PRINT&quot;, though spelling out the word is not only acceptable but canonical -- Applesoft converted &quot;?&quot; in entered programs to &quot;PRINT&quot; and the question mark would be &quot;expanded&quot; when entered program lines were listed back out. So the program above would actually appear in a LIST command as shown below:

 10 TEXT : HOME
 20 PRINT &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;

''This article includes text from [http://everything2.com/?node=Applesoft+BASIC Everything2], licensed under GFDL.''

== Trivia ==
* There was a well-documented bug in Applesoft BASIC that could actually crash the interpreter if ONERR GOTO was in effect and numerous program errors occurred. Apple provided a short assembly-language routine which could be POKEd into RAM and CALLed to ameliorate the problem to an extent. Later it was discovered by an enterprising hacker that the required code was actually in the Applesoft ROM (though it was never executed) and could be called there instead.

* Applesoft could be extended by two means: the ampersand (&amp;amp;) command and the USR() function. Machine-language routines could be attached to the ampersand and USR hooks in the computer's memory and call Applesoft ROM code to retrieve the values of parameters that followed them. A number of third-party packages were produced to add functionality to Applesoft by one or the other of these mechanisms.

* Applesoft, like Integer BASIC before it, did not come with any built-in commands for dealing with files or disks. The Apple II disk operating system, known simply as DOS, thus intercepted all input typed by the user to determine whether it was a DOS command. Similarly, all output was scrutinized for a Control-D character (ASCII 4), which BASIC programs would send before printing a disk command to get DOS's attention. ProDOS followed this lead, although the BASIC command interpreter was placed in a separate program called BASIC.SYSTEM.

* Neither Apple nor Microsoft ever made source code for Applesoft BASIC available. However, Glen Bredon included a program with his Merlin assembler that would generate a copy of a BASIC disassembly from the ROMs in a user's computer, cleverly skirting copyright law.

* Both Integer BASIC and Applesoft used the technique of ''tokenizing'' to reduce the memory requirements of programs and to speed their interpretation. As code was entered, BASIC keywords would be converted to single-byte tokens; the process was reversed when the program was listed. Integer BASIC used characters with codes above 127 for normal text and codes below 128 for tokens; Applesoft used exactly the reverse.

* Due to Applesoft BASIC's slow performance, BASIC compilers were much sought-after tools for BASIC programmers. The first, Microsoft's The AppleSoft Compiler (TASC), was actually written in Applesoft and then used to compile itself. A later product, the Einstein Compiler, was somewhat more sophisticated and offered better performance both in compilation and in execution. The ultimate BASIC compiler was the Beagle Compiler, published by [[Beagle Bros]]; it integrated closely with ProDOS (the current Apple II OS at the time of its reelase), compiled programs in seconds rather than minutes, and achieved superior code execution performance. However, unlike previous compilers, the Beagle Compiler did not truly compile BASIC programs to machine code, but rather converted them to a highly optimized pseudo-code that was interpreted by a runtime module.

[[Image:Asterix-Asterix.gif|frame|right|&quot;A shrewd, cunning little warrior; all perilous missions are immediately entrusted to him.&quot;]]

'''Asterix''' ([[French language|French]]: '''Astérix''') is a [[fictional character]], created in [[1959]] as the [[hero]] of a [[List of Asterix volumes|series of volumes]] of [[France|French]] [[comic book]]s by [[René Goscinny]] (stories) and [[Albert Uderzo]] (illustrations). Uderzo has continued the series since the death of Goscinny in [[1977]].

The books have been translated into many languages, including dialects and even [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]]. They are probably the most popular [[Franco-Belgian comics|French comic]] in the world, and familiar to people of all ages in most European countries. Asterix is less well known in the [[United States]] and [[Japan]], which both have strong comic book traditions of their own.

The key to the success of the series is that it contains comic elements for all ages: young children like the fist-fights and other visual gags, while adults can appreciate the cleverness of the allusions and [[pun]]s that sparkle throughout the texts.

Note: the names of the characters contain puns, and vary with translation into other languages. This article uses the names from the English-language translations of [[Anthea Bell]] and [[Derek Hockridge]]. For the French names see [[Asterix#Major recurring characters|below]].

Several books have been made into films, mostly animated, some with live actors. See [[List of Asterix films and videogames]].
 
==Setting and characters==
Asterix lives around [[50 BC]] in a fictional village in northwest [[Armorica]] (a region of ancient [[Gaul]] mostly identical to modern [[Brittany]]). This village is celebrated amongst the Gauls as the only part of that country not yet conquered by [[Julius Caesar]] and his [[Roman legion]]s. The inhabitants of the village gain superhuman strength by drinking a magic [[potion]] prepared by the [[Druidry|druid]] Getafix (French: Panoramix). The village is surrounded by the ocean on one side, and four Roman garrisons on the other, intended to keep a watchful eye and ensure that the Gauls do not get up to mischief.

A recurring plot in many of the Asterix books concerns the attempts by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s to prevent the druid from making the potion, or trying to get the secret recipe for their own use. Such attempts are invariably foiled by the heroes of the books - the agile, clever and pint-sized Asterix and his clumsy, oversized, but extremely strong and good-hearted best friend, [[Obelix]].

The humour encountered in the Asterix comics is typically French, often centring on puns, caricatures, and [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[stereotype]]s of contemporary [[Europe]]an nations and [[List of regions in France|French regions]]. Much of the humour in the initial Asterix books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the book into other languages for fear of losing the joke and the spirit of the story. Some translations have actually added local humour: in the [[italian language|Italian]] translation, the Roman legionnaires are made to speak in 20th-century Roman slang. The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.

In spite of (or perhaps because of) this [[stereotyping]] and notwithstanding some alleged streaks of French [[chauvinism]], it has been very well received by European and Francophone cultures around the world.
Allegations of chauvinism are ironic considering that Uderzo is of Italian descent, and Goscinny was of Ukrainian-Polish Jewish descent.

==Humour==
===Stereotypes and allusions===
Everywhere they visit, Asterix and Obelix encounter people and things borrowed and caricatured from 20th century real life. In the early album ''[[Asterix and the Goths]]'', for instance, the [[Goths]] are represented as [[militarism|militaristic]] and regimented, reminiscent of late nineteenth and early twentieth century [[Germany|Germans]]. The helmets worn by these Goths even resemble the German [[Pickelhaube]] helmets worn up to [[World War I]] and one of their leaders bears an uncanny resemblance to [[Otto von Bismarck]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] are shown as polite and phlegmatic, drinking warm [[beer]] or hot [[water]] with a drop of milk (before the first [[tea]] has been brought to what would become [[England]] by Asterix); they boil all their food and serve it with mint sauce, and they drive their chariots on the wrong side of the road. [[Iberian Peninsula|Spain]] is the cheap country down south where people from the [[Northern Europe|North]] vacation. All the tribes represented are treated humorously as prototypes for their modern counterparts, and many aspects of them are satirised. However, the French are not exempt from satire, and almost all of the peoples Asterix meets are portrayed positively, even the Romans. The only tribe depicted completely unflatteringly is the Goths, possibly a result of the Second World War.

Some caricatures of the traits of certain French regions are also used: the people from [[Normandy]] smother their food in cream and cannot give a straight answer; the people from [[Marseille]] play [[boules]] and exaggerate matters, and [[Corsica]]ns don't like to do any work, are easily angered and have long-standing [[vendetta]]s that they settle violently, and make cheese that smells so bad that it actually becomes an explosive.

Minor characters often resemble famous people or fictional characters, usually caricatures of existing French people of the same era, particularly from television and the spectacles. In ''[[Obelix and Co.]]'', for example, the young Roman bureaucrat is a caricature of a young [[Jacques Chirac]], and it includes two Roman legionaries drawn to the likeness of [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]]. In ''[[Asterix and the Falling Sky]]'', the super-clones are a caricature of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Those characters usually stick out visually, by not having the round, oversized noses otherwise typical of Uderzo's style.  

Other side characters allude to people related to the place Asterix is visiting. Notable examples include a very [[Elizabeth Taylor]]-like Cleopatra in  ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]''; Britain's most famous bards in the story ''[[Asterix in Britain]]'', who are four in number and look remarkably like [[the Beatles]]; a pair of Belgian warriors in ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]'' who resemble and also speak like Thomson and Thompson of [[Tintin]]-fame; and both [[Don Quixote]] and [[Sancho Panza]] are depicted in ''[[Asterix in Spain]]''. More recently, this spoofing has occasionally extended to major characters as well: in ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]'', a Roman spy is a young [[Sean Connery]] named Dubbelosix drawn in [[James Bond]] style, and in ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]'', the leader of the escaped slaves (named Spartakis, being Greek) is based on [[Kirk Douglas]]' [[Spartacus]].  In ''[[Asterix and the Cauldron]]'', the head of the theatre is Laurensolivius, based on the actor [[Laurence Olivier]].

The stories also feature allusions to major artistic works (such as [[Pieter Bruegel]]'s ''[[:Image:Bruegel_peasant_wedding_dsc01965.jpg|Peasant Wedding]]'' and [[Victor Hugo]]'s story of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] from ''Les Châtiments'', in ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]''), as well as historical personalities ([[Napoleon]], [[Louis XIV of France]]), and famous places (the [[Moulin Rouge]], [[Bethlehem]]) and the [[Statue of Liberty]] (played by Asterix)).

However, in many other respects the series reflects life in the [[1st century BC]] fairly accurately for the medium. For example, the multi-storied apartments in Rome&amp;mdash;the insulae&amp;mdash;which have Obelix remarking that one man's roof is another man's floor, and consequently, &quot;These Romans are crazy&quot;: his favourite line. This line itself is also an intrinsic joke on [[Rome]] and the Romans, as its [[Italian Language|Italian]] equivalent is &quot;Sono pazzi questi romani&quot;, which abbreviates as &quot;[[SPQR]]&quot;, as does the motto of the Roman Empire.  On the other hand, the presence of chimneys in the Gaulish huts is not accurate, as they used gabled openings in the roof to let smoke escape.  Also, [[menhir]]s are now believed to have been erected long before the Gauls.

The text also makes relatively regular use of original [[List of Latin phrases|Latin phrases]], and allusions to Julius Caesar's ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'', a book about the conquest of Gaul, later used as an introductory text to [[Latin]]. Some jokes are made about Caesar's use of the third person to write about himself. Such allusions were likely to be well-received by the better-educated sections of the French and Belgian public in the [[1960s]], when the teaching of Latin was still widespread in high schools.

===Puns in names===
[[Image:Asterix-Main_Gaul_characters.jpeg|thumb|From left to right: Geriatrix, Unhygienix, Obelix (and Dogmatix), Asterix, Vitalstatistix, Getafix, Fulliautomatix, and Cacofonix (the porters are unnamed)]]

A key feature of the text of the ''Asterix'' books are the constant [[pun]]s used as names of characters; The names of the two protagonists come from [[asterisk]] and [[obelisk]], Asterix being the star of the books (Latin ''aster'' (derived from the Greek word αστήρ (astir) [star] and Celtic ''rix'' [king, cognate to Latin ''rex'', [[Sanskrit]] ''raj'', German ''reich'', English ''rich'', etc]), and Obelix being a [[menhir]] delivery-man.  This is a double pun, since as well as meaning a stone monolith, the word ''obelisk'' can also refer to the [[dagger (typography)|typographical dagger]] (&amp;dagger;) that is often used to denote the second footnote on a page after an ''asterisk'' (*) has been used to reference the first.  In fact, nearly all the Gaulish characters' names end in ''-ix'', probably a reference to the real-life Gaulish chieftain such as [[Vercingetorix]] (though in life only the names of Gaulish kings&amp;mdash;and not even all of them&amp;mdash;ended in ''-ix'', and if they did it was always ''-rix''). English language examples include the chief ([[Vitalstatistix]]), the druid ([[Getafix]]), the fishmonger ([[Unhygienix]]), and an old man ([[Geriatrix]]) with a young wife. Roman characters' names end with ''-us'' as in Noxious Vapus and Crismusbonus. Female names do not follow the rules: for instance the wife of the Roman Osseus Humerus is Fibula, and his daughter Tibia. Other nations have their own style of naming&amp;mdash;Vikings use ''-af'' (Bathyscaf, Toocleverbyhaf, Timandahaf), Egyptians use ''-is'' (Edifis, Artifis), Britons use ''-ax'' (Hiphiphurrax, Notax, Valueaddedtax, and the notable exception Mykingdomforanos), Goths use ''-ic'' ([[Rhetoric]], Choleric) and Spaniards use Spanish-sounding names such as Huevos Y Bacon (Eggs and Bacon). Most names stand as solitary puns, like Getafix or Geriatrix, and some play on each other, as in the example of a Roman guard talking through a closed door to another guard: &quot;Open up, Sendervictorius! It's me, Appianglorius!&quot; This is a pun on the UK national anthem &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; and the lines &quot;Send her victorious, happy and glorious, long to reign over us, God save the Queen&quot;.

====Names in the French version====
Many of these puns reflect the French original, in which, for example, the Egyptian in ''Astérix Légionnaire'' is named Courdeténis (''cour de tennis'', i.e. &quot;tennis court&quot;) in French and Ptenisnet in English. But the translation of puns is difficult, and [[Anthea Bell]] and [[Derek Hockridge]] do a good job in the English language edition. For example, the translation of Ordralfabétix (referring to ''ordre alphabétique'', &quot;alphabetical order&quot;), is Unhygienix, given that this character is a fishmonger infamous for his rotting product. The original Panoramix, which perhaps represents the druid who sees the whole picture, is named Getafix in the English version, as &quot;get a fix&quot; conveys the fact he makes potent potions. Assurancetourix (''assurance tous risques'' or &quot;comprehensive insurance&quot;), the ear-offending [[bard]] of the village, becomes the apt Cacofonix.  Another clever translation is that of Idéfix, a dog who has very strong views on the environment (he howls whenever he sees an uprooted tree). An ''idée fixe'' is a &quot;fixed idea&quot;, i.e. an obsession, a dogma. The translation, [[Dogmatix]], manages to conserve the &quot;fixed idea&quot; meaning and also include the syllable ''dog''. Note that the [[American English]] version of the comic was done by a different translator, and tends to use different names. Since these translations were of such poor quality, many North American fans of the series seek out the British translations instead. The word ''asterix'' is also commonly mis-used by [[English language]] speakers and writers in place of ''asterisk''. 

The chief is called Abraracourcix, derived from the phrase ''à bras racourci'' meaning &quot;with arm shortened, ready to punch.&quot; Another series of puns, at least in the original French include the names of the four camps (castra) which surround Asterix's village, e.g. one of them is called &quot;Babaorum&quot;, a pun on ''baba au rhum'' or [[rum baba]], a popular kind of pastry.

&lt;!--: Which album does he appear in, and what does he do? --&gt;

===Running gags===
A number of running gags recur in various albums. One of these is that the bard Cacofonix wants to create a spontaneous song whenever Asterix and Obelix leave or come back for a grand journey, but is usually prevented from doing so by Fulliautomatix (the blacksmith). At the end of most adventures (most notable exceptions in ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'', ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'' and ''[[Asterix and the Falling Sky]]''), he ends up not attending the final banquet which usually marks the end of an episode; instead he is seen tied up and gagged up in his tree-house in the same panel in which the feast takes place, so as not to disrupt the festivities.

Another running gag is a group of [[pirate]]s that tend to get caught in the middle of conflict and have their ship sunk, resembling the painting [[The Raft of the Medusa]] by [[Théodore Géricault]], most notably in ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]''. The ship is often sunk for a variety of reasons, such as a stray thrown menhir, though usually through Asterix and Obelix boarding them. In one episode, they attack a ship carrying a Roman agent, who points at a random crew member and states he gave him a bagful of gold if he would not attack the agent. In the ensuing battle over the nonexistent bag of gold, the pirates sink their own ship. In another, tired of being sunk, they give up pirating completely and open a ship-themed restaurant. Asterix and Obelix arrive and the restaurant is soon smashed to pieces. Those pirates—most notably the red-bearded captain, the constantly Latin-quoting peg-legged second-in-command, and the African lookout—are caricatures of the characters of &quot;Barbe Rouge, Le Démon des Caraïbes&quot;, a pirate series that was published at the same time in [[Pilote]], the weekly comics magazine in which Asterix appeared, and which Goscinny also edited.

===Revisionist explanations===
In the albums, some historical facts are retold, and attributed to Asterix &amp; Obelix. 
*In ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'', when visiting Egypt, Obelix scales the [[Great Sphinx of Giza#Missing nose|sphinx]]. He then falls down, grabs the sphinx's nose, but it breaks. Immediately all the souvenir-shops nearby chisel off the noses of their souvenir-sphinxes in order to maintain the resemblance to the real monument. This may be a reference to the (false) belief that Napoleon's troops destroyed the sphinx's nose by using it for target practice.
*In ''[[Asterix in Britain]]'', the Britons are used to drinking hot water with a drop of [[milk]]. Only when Asterix puts in tea-leaves, given by the druid, the habit becomes tea-drinking.
*In ''[[Asterix in Spain]]'', Asterix ends up in a circus in front of an [[aurochs]] (not a lion, there). He evades the bull nicely, and gets an applause from the audience. A guest of the Roman general drops her red cape in the arena. When Asterix wants to hand it back, the bull reacts and is finished after some dancing moves of Asterix, giving us the first bullfight. 
*In the same book, Unhygenix the fishmonger agrees to take payment for his boat rental in menhirs, as he wants to develop land on [[Salisbury Plain]]&amp;mdash;which explains the mystery of [[Stonehenge]].
*In ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]'' (Le Tour de Gaule) Obelix travels around Gaul with a yellow knapsack on his back, as if wearing the yellow jersey in the modern Tour de France. Complete with a white square patch on the backside, where we can imagine the cyclist's number.
*In ''[[Asterix in Switzerland]]'', Asterix manages to carry an unconscious Obelix through the Alps, by tying ropes around himself, Obelix, and their guides, creating a famous technique in mountain-climbing.
*In ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]'', the chieftain of Asterix's Belgian hosts gains inspiration for ''patates frites'' (chips) and mussels, Belgium's two most famous culinary ambassadors, from a vat of boiling oil prepared as a Roman weapon, and a damp wooden plank belonging to the pirates (note that [[potato]]es were unknown in Europe at the time).
*In ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'', Cacofonix composes the protest anthem &quot;We shall Overcome&quot;, which became the US civil rights movement song.
*In ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]'', Julius Caesar asks Brutus to clap for him using the famous Shakespearean phrase &quot;Et tu Brute&quot;.
*In ''[[Asterix in Britain]]'', Asterix' cousin speaks about building a tunnel under the water from Dover to France and says that it's a dream project which he hopes to achieve some day.

===Influences===
*The first satellite launched by [[France]] in [[1965]] received the name of the character, and during the campaign for [[Paris]] to obtain the right to host the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] Asterix appeared in many posters over the [[Eiffel Tower]].

*The Israeli [[Psy-trance]] DJ and producer [[Astrix]] is named after the character.

The '''Arizona Cardinals''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in the [[Phoenix, Arizona]] [[metropolitan area]]. In 2006, the club will move to the new [[Cardinals Stadium]] in the suburb of [[Glendale, Arizona]]. They currently belong to the [[NFC West|Western Division]] of the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL).

The Cardinals are the oldest existing professional American football club in the [[United States]]. The team was formed in 1898 as the '''Morgan Athletic Club''' in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. The club was then called the '''Racine Normals''' since they were originally located on Racine Avenue but moved to Chicago's Normal Field. They then changed their name to the '''Racine Cardinals''' after they started wearing cardinal red uniforms.

After becoming a charter member of the NFL in 1920, the club was renamed the '''Chicago Cardinals'''. The Cardinals moved to [[Saint Louis, Missouri]] in 1960, then relocated to the Phoenix area in 1988. The team was known as the '''Phoenix Cardinals''' before it started using &quot;Arizona&quot; in its name in 1994.

The Cardinals have won [[List of NFL champions|NFL Championships]] in 1925 and 1947. But the team has not won a league title since then, and thus currently holds the record for the longest championship drought (period of not winning) in NFL history.  Despite being the oldest existing professional football franchise in the United States, the Arizona Cardinals have an all-time postseason record of 2-5.  (Not counting the 1964 [[Playoff Bowl|Bert Bell Benefit Bowl]])

==Franchise history==
[[Image:Chicago_cardinals.GIF|left|framed|Chicago Cardinals logo.]]
The Cardinals are the oldest existing football club in the [[United States]], beginning as an amateur athletic club team in Chicago named the Morgan Athletic Club, which was founded by Chicago painter/builder [[Chris O'Brien]].  They began to field a pro team even before the founding of the NFL.  He later moved them to Chicago's Normal Field and the team was named ''The Racine Normals'', since they were originally located on Racine Avenue in Chicago.  In 1901, O'Brien bought used [[Maroon (color)|maroon]] uniforms from the [[University of Chicago]].  The colors had faded by this time, leading O'Brien to exclaim, &quot;That's not maroon, it's cardinal red!&quot;  It was right there that the team changed its name to the '''Racine Cardinals'''.  

The team disbanded in 1906 due mostly to a lack of local competition, but reformed in [[1913]].  They were forced to suspend operations for a second time in 1918 due to [[World War I]] and the outbreak of the [[Spanish_Flu|Spanish Flu Pandemic]].  They resumed operations later in the year, and have operated continuously since then.

The team became a charter member of the [[American Professional Football Association]] (which became the NFL in 1922) in 1920, for the franchise fee of $100. According to some, the team's name was erroneously recorded as &quot;[[Racine, Wisconsin]].&quot; The team was renamed the '''Chicago Cardinals''' in 1922 after a team from [[Racine, Wisconsin]] entered the league.  That season the team moved into [[Comiskey Park]].

In 1932 the team was purchased by [[Charles Bidwill]], then a vice president of the [[Chicago Bears]].  The team has been under the ownership of the Bidwill family since then.

The Cardinals won their first NFL championship in [[1925 in sports|1925]], finishing the season with a record of 11-2-1 (until the 1933 season, the league champion was determined solely by win-loss percentage).  It was actually awarded by default, since the [[Pottsville Maroons]], the team with the best record, had their franchise revoked for violating the territorial rights of the [[Frankford Yellowjackets]].  The team posted a winning record only twice in the twenty years (1931 and 1935) after their championship.

In 1944, owing to player shortages caused by [[World War II]], the Cardinals and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] merged for one year and were known as the &quot;Card-Pitts,&quot; or derisively as the &quot;Carpets&quot; as they were winless that season.

The Cardinals won their last NFL championship game in 1947 (28-21 over the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]) with their &quot;Million-Dollar Backfield,&quot; which included [[quarterback]] [[Paul Christman]] and [[halfback (American football)|halfback]] [[Charley Trippi]].  They advanced to the championship game the next season, but lost 7-0 in a rematch with the Eagles.

In 1960 the team moved to St. Louis.  During this period, two big-league teams of that name existed in the city.  Sports fans and local news broadcasters got into the habit of calling them &quot;the football Cardinals&quot; or &quot;the [[St. Louis Cardinals|baseball Cardinals]]&quot; to distinguish the two.  The change in scenery did little to alter the team's fortunes.  During the Cardinals' stay in St. Louis, they advanced to the playoffs just four times (one of those was in a [[Playoff Bowl|season-ending consolation game]], and another was in the NFC tournament following the strike-shortened 1982 season).  The team left St. Louis in 1987 when owner [[Bill Bidwill]] was unable to convince the city to build a new stadium. 

In 1988 the Cardinals moved to [[Arizona]], became the '''Phoenix Cardinals''', and started playing home games in [[Sun Devil Stadium]] on the campus of [[Arizona State University]].  They became the '''Arizona Cardinals''' in 1994.  The team did not post a winning record for 13 seasons (1985 to 1997).  [[Joe Bugel]] coached from 1990 to 1993, usually finishing last in the NFC East, which produced the [[Super Bowl]] winner in each of those seasons (Giants 90, Redskins 91, Cowboys 92-3).  [[Buddy Ryan]] replaced Bugel in 1994, lasting 2 seasons.  He infamously guaranteed victory in the 1994 Week 3 game at the [[Cleveland Browns]] (Cleveland won, 32-0). Ryan was followed by [[Vince Tobin]], under whom the Cardinals posted a 9-7 record in 1998 and advanced to the playoffs for the first time since the 1982 season.  They upset the favored [[Dallas Cowboys]] in the wild-card round, 20-7, but lost their divisional playoff to the [[Minnesota Vikings]], 41-21.  

Tobin was fired during the 2000 season and replaced by defensive coordinator [[Dave McGinnis]], who remained head coach until his firing in 2003; McGinnis compiled a win-loss record of 17-40 during his tenure.

The Cardinals have not won more than seven games in a season since their 1998 playoff appearance, and have had one of the worst yearly attendance records in the NFL.

In 2004, the Cardinals hired as their head coach former [[Minnesota Vikings]] head coach [[Dennis Green]], who compiled a 97-62 record in ten seasons with Minnesota (1992-2001), leading that franchise to four NFC Central Division titles and two NFC Championship games.

In 2000, [[Maricopa County]] voters passed a ballot initiative by a margin of 51% to 49%, providing funding for a new Cardinals stadium (as well as for improvements to [[Major League Baseball]] [[spring training]] facilities in the greater Phoenix region; and youth recreation). After some legal obstacles, the Cardinals began construction of their new facility in April 2003, in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], one of the northwestern suburbs of Phoenix.  Cardinals Stadium will feature a retractable roof and a slide-out grass surface, and is scheduled to open for the 2006 season [http://www.azcardinals.com/stadium/].  It will also be the location of [[Super Bowl XLII]] (2008).

==Franchise history==
{{cleanup-remainder|February 2006}}

'''Timeline / Important Years'''
* 1965 - The Atlanta Falcons are born.  NFL Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]], grants ownership to Rankin M. Smith Sr.  They draft [[Tommy Nobis]], LB, University of Texas with the 1st pick of the [http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/draft/1966.jsp 1966 NFL Draft] held on November 27, 1965, making him the first ever Falcon.
* 1966 - The Falcons play their first NFL season.  After losing their first nine games, the Falcons would get their first franchise win on the road against the [[New York Giants]] 27-16 [http://www.atlantafalcons.com/history/timeline.jsp]. Former Giant Ernie Wheelwright scored two TD's receiving and ran for 51 more yards as QB Randy Johnson hit for a trio of TD's.  Their first ever home victory against the [[Arizona Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals]] 16-10.  The Falcons end their inaugural season at 3-11, yet Nobis wins the NFL Rookie of the Year Award and becomes the first Falcon named to the Pro Bowl.  
* 1968 - On October 1 , [[Norm Van Brocklin]], formerly head coach of the [[Minnesota Vikings]], is named to replace Norb Hecker after three games of season. Two weeks later, his Falcons beat New York, 24-21, in first meeting between Van Brocklin and his former QB, [[Fran Tarkenton]].
* 1969 - On September 21, the Falcons win their first season opener ever, beating the [[San Francisco 49ers]], 24-12, before home fans. Rookie Tight End Jim Mitchell scored two TD's and club set team record with 229 yards rushing. On [[December 7]], [[Harmon Wages]] threw for a TD in the first quarter (16 yards to [[Paul Flatley]]), caught a pass for a TD in the second quarter (88 yards), and then ran for a TD in the fourth quarter (66 yards) in a 45-17 rout of the Saints. The Falcons finish the year with a 6-8 record.
* 1970 - First [[Monday Night Football]] game in Atlanta - Nov. 30 vs. [[Miami Dolphins]] (Lost 20-7)
* 1971 - On November 22, the Falcons win their first nationally televised game with a 28-21 triumph over Green Bay in Atlanta. Atlanta had 77 plays to the Packers 33, outgaining them 386-143, as [[Monday Night Football]] televised the action. On December 19, the Falcons beat New Orleans, 24-20, with 40 seconds left in the game. The victory gives the Falcons with a winning record for the first time, at 7-6-1.
* 1972 - On October 1, the Falcons finally defeat the [[St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]], 31-3 at Atlanta Stadium. [[Dave Hampton]] and [[Art Malone]] set a club record by each running for over 100 yards. On December 17, Hampton technically became the club's first 1,000- yard rusher. Against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], the veteran running back ran for his 1,000th yard. However, his next carry was a six-yard loss and his final carry a one-yard gain. Thus, he ended at 995. The Falcons finish second in the NFC West, their highest division finish in franchise history up to that point, with a 7-7 record. 
* 1973 - Opening against New Orleans, the Falcons smash 35 team records en route to 62-7 victory on September 16. On November 19, the Falcons upset the unbeaten [[Minnesota Vikings|Vikings]], 20-14, before a national television audience. Dave Hampton once again barely misses the 1,000 yard mark. The Falcons finish 9-5 for their most wins and best record ever, but lose out for the playoffs by one game.
* 1974 - Falcons fall into last place in the NFC West with a 3-11 record. Van Brocklin is dismissed as Head Coach.
* 1975 - With the first pick in the NFL Draft, the club selects quarterback [[Steve Bartkowski]] of the [[University of California]]. The Falcons finish the year with a 4-10 record, but Dave Hampton finally breaks the 1,000 yard mark (1,002) in a 22-13 loss to the [[Green Bay Packers]].
* 1977 - Former NFL quarterback [[Eddie LeBaron]] is named General Manager, and [[Leeman Bennett]] becomes the fifth Head Coach in club history. The Falcons defense sets an NFL record for the fewest points allowed in a 14 game season, 129. Falcons finish with a 7-7 record.
* 1978 - On November 12, Falcons win over the [[New Orleans Saints]] in a game now known as &quot;Big Ben Right&quot;. With 19 seconds left, Bartkowski threw 57 yards into a cluster where [[Alfred Jackson]] caught a pass deflected by [[Wallace Francis]]. The Falcons make the playoffs for the first time with a 9-7 record, and beat the visiting [[Philadelphia Eagles]] 14-13 on Christmas Eve. The next week they lose to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in Dallas, 27-20.
* 1979 - The team finishes with a 6-10 record. Records were broken for the season by [[William Andrews]] with 1,023 yards, by [[Wallace Francis]] with 74 catches for 1,013 yards and by Steve Bartkowski with 2,502 yards (203-379).
* 1980 - Highly successful season for the Falcons, as they finish 12-4.
