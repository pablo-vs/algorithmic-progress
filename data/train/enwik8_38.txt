'''Arcturus''' (α Boo / α Boötis / [[alpha (letter)|Alpha]] Boötis) is the brightest star in the [[constellation]] [[Boötes]], and the [[list of brightest stars|third brightest star]] in the night sky, with a [[visual magnitude]] of &amp;minus;0.05, after [[Sirius]] and [[Canopus (star)|Canopus]] (fourth, if the [[Sun]] is included). Because [[Alpha Centauri]] consists of two bright stars which are closer together than the limit of resolution of the human eye, Alpha Centauri actually appears brighter than Arcturus to the naked eye. It is the second brightest star visible from northern latitudes and the brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere.

It is a [[stellar classification|type]] K1.5 IIIpe [[red giant]] star &amp;mdash; the letters &quot;pe&quot; stand for &quot;peculiar emission,&quot; which indicates that the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of [[light]] given off by the star is unusual and full of [[emission line]]s. This is not too uncommon in red giants, but Arcturus has a particularly strong case of the phenomenon. It is at least 110 times more luminous than the [[Sun]], but this underestimates its strength as much of the &quot;light&quot; it gives off is in the [[infrared]]; total power output is about 180 times that of the Sun.  

An easy way to find Arcturus is to follow the arc of the handle of the [[Big Dipper]]. By continuing in this path, one can find [[Spica]] (α [[Virgo|Virginis]]) as well &amp;mdash; leading to the coinage of the popular maxim, &quot;Arc to Arcturus, then speed on to Spica.&quot;

== Facts ==
Arcturus is notable for its high proper motion, larger than any first magnitude star other than nearby [[Alpha Centauri|α Centauri]]. It is now at its closest point to the Sun, and is moving rapidly relative to the solar system. Arcturus is thought to be an old disk star, and appears to be moving with a group of 52 other such stars. Its mass is hard to exactly determine, but may be about the same as the Sun, and is no more than 1.5 solar masses. Arcturus is likely to be considerably older than the Sun, and much like what the Sun will be in its red giant phase.

According to the ''[[Hipparcos]]'' satellite, Arcturus is 36.7 [[light year]]s (11.3 [[parsec]]s) (215.5 trillion miles) from [[Earth]], relatively close in astronomical terms. From this satellite's observations, Arcturus is now known to be slightly [[variable star|variable]], by about 0.04 magnitudes over 8.3 days. It is believed that the surface of the star oscillates slightly, a common feature of red giant stars. In the case of Arcturus, this was an interesting discovery as it is known that the redder (more towards or within the M spectral class) a giant gets, the more variable it will be. Extreme cases like [[Mira]] undergo large swings over hundreds of days; Arcturus is not very red and is a borderline case between variability and stability with its short period and tiny range.

''Hipparcos'' also suggested that Arcturus is a [[binary star]], with the companion about twenty times dimmer than the primary and orbiting close enough to be at the very limits of our current ability to make it out. The most recent studies of the issue are generally coming down on the side of it being a single star, however.

==Alternative and former names==

The name of the star derives from ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] Αρκτούρος ('''Arktouros''') and means &quot;Bear Guard.&quot; This is a reference to it being the brightest star in the constellation Boötes the Hunter (of which it forms the left foot), which is next to the Big and Little Bears, [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor]].

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], it is called '''Haris-el-sema''', &quot;the keeper of heaven.&quot; This name has been variously [[Romanization|romanized]] in the past, leading to obsolete variants such as '''Aramec''' and '''Azimech'''.

It corresponds to the [[Hindu_calendar|Hindu]] astronomy [[Nakshatra]] of [[Svati|Svātī]].

==Cultural significance==

Prehistoric [[Polynesia|Polynesian]] [[navigation|navigators]] knew Arcturus as '''[[Hokulea|Hokule'a]]''', the &quot;Star of Joy.&quot;  Arcturus is the [[Zenith Star]] of the [[Hawaiian Islands]].  Using Hokule'a and other stars,  the Polynesians launched their double-hulled [[canoe]]s from [[Tahiti]] and the [[Marquesas Islands]].  Traveling east and north they eventually crossed the [[equator]] and reached the [[latitude]] where Arcturus would appear directly overhead in the summer [[night sky]].  Knowing they had arrived at the exact latitude of the island chain, they sailed due west on the [[trade wind]]s until making landfall. If Hokule'a could be kept directly overhead, they landed on the southeastern shores of the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii]].  For a return trip to Tahiti the navigators could use [[Sirius]], the zenith star of that island.

The star achieved fame in [[1933]] when its light was used to open the [[World's Fair]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. The star was chosen as that light had started its journey at about the time of the previous Chicago fair in [[1893]].

===In fiction===
In the [[fiction|fictionalized]] universe of [[Marvel Universe|Marvel]] comics, the Arcturan system is [[binary star|binary]] and has at least four [[planet]]s. It is also an inhabited binary system in the 1920 novel [http://www.litrix.com/arcturus/arctu001.htm ''A Voyage to Arcturus''], by [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]]. 

In'' [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' there are several references to Arcturan species and things, presumably originating on a planet orbiting Arcturus. Examples include &quot;Arcturan Megadonkey&quot; and &quot;Arcturan Megafreighter&quot;, see [[wikisource:The Ultra-Complete Index to the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy|The Ultra-Complete Index]] for a more extensive list.

[[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[The Foundation Series]] has [[Arcturus (planet)|Arcturus]] as the capital of the [[Sirius Sector]] in the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]].

In [[Stargate Atlantis]], [[Project Arcturus]] is a failed [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] power-source project.

[[Arcturus]] is also a [[Korea]]n [[Computer role-playing game|RPG]] game created jointly by [[Gravity Corporation]] and Sonnori.

David Linsey has a fantasy or science fiction novel 'A Voyage to Arcturus'.

In the [[Starcraft]] series of games, Sons of Korhal leader and later Emperor Arcturus Mengsk is presumably named for this star.  There is some ambiguity, however, as the word 'arcturus' occurs in [[Latin]] (as the Future Active Participle of the verb 'arcere') and could provide an alternative source for the name.

===In new-age religion===

Some [[New Age]]rs believe in [[Arcturians]], a supposed highly advanced [[extraterrestrial]] race.

===In the Bible===
In the [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]], Arcturus is mentioned twice in the [[Book of Job]]:
:&quot;Which maketh ''Arcturus'', [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], and [[Pleiades (astronomy)|Pleiades]], and the chambers of the south.&quot;
::[[wikisource:Bible, English, King James, Job#Chapter 9|''Job 9:9'']] 
:&quot;Canst thou bring forth [[Mazzaroth]] in his season?
:or canst thou guide ''Arcturus'' with his sons?&quot;
::[[wikisource:Bible, English, King James, Job#Chapter 38|''Job 38:32'']] 
The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word thus translated is עיש ''Ash'' or'' 'Ayish''. Due to the obscurity of ancient terminology, some scholars dispute this identification, instead equating it with [[Aldebaran]], [[Canopus (star)|Canopus]], Ursa Major, or the Pleiades, among other celestial objects{{ref|ash}}.

=== Occult traditions ===

In the [[astrology]] of the [[Middle Ages]], Arcturus was one of the 15 [[Behenian fixed stars]], associated with [[jasper]] and the [[plantago|plantain]] herb. [[Cornelius Agrippa]] lists its symbol [[Image:Agrippa1531 Alchameth.png]] under the alternate name '''Alchameth'''.

{{wiktionarypar|absinthe}}
'''Absinthe''' (from [[French language|French]], from [[Latin]] ''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/absinthium absinthium]'', [[ancient Greek]] ''apsinthion'', &quot;[[Artemisia (plant)|wormwood]]&quot;) is a high-[[ethanol|alcohol]] [[anise]]-flavored spirit derived from [[herb]]s including the flowers and leaves of the medicinal plant ''[[Absinth Wormwood|Artemisia absinthium]]'', also called [[wormwood]]. Historically it has been ambiguous whether it is a [[liqueur]] or aromatized spirit&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext95/pge0112.txt 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica] at [[Project Gutenberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; however modern regulations have reclassified it as a spirit due to its low sugar content&lt;ref name=&quot;EEC&quot;&gt;[http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31989R1576:EN:HTML Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 of 29 May 1989 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks] an EEC regulation requires a sugar content of 100g per litre for a drink to be labelled a liqueur.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nicknamed ''la Fée Verte'' (&quot;The Green [[Fairy]]&quot;), absinthe has a taste similar to other anise-flavored liqueurs, with a light bitterness imparted by the use of other herbs, and is traditionally a pale or emerald [[green]] in color. It is especially known for its popularity in [[France]]&amp;mdash;particularly its romantic associations with [[Bohemianism|Parisian]] artists and writers&amp;mdash;in the late [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th centuries]], until its [[prohibition]] in 1915. The most popular brand of absinthe worldwide at the time was [[Pernod Fils]]. At the height of its popularity, absinthe was portrayed as a dangerously [[addictive]], [[psychoactive]] drug and similarly banned in other European countries and in the [[United States]]. In fact, high alcohol content and a suggestive reputation are now considered to be its most active ingredients. A modern-day absinthe revival began in the [[1990s]], as countries in the [[European Union]] began to reauthorize its manufacture and sale.

==Constituents==
[[Image:Koehler1887-PimpinellaAnisum.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Anise]]
[[Image:Koeh-164.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Grand Wormwood]]
In addition to wormwood, absinthe contains [[anise]] (often partially substituted with [[star anise]]), Florence [[fennel]], [[hyssop]], [[Lemon balm|melissa]], and [[Roman wormwood]] (''Artemisia pontica''). Various recipes also include [[angelica]] root, [[sweet flag]], [[dittany]] leaves, [[coriander (spice)|coriander]], [[veronica (plant)|veronica]], [[juniper]], [[nutmeg]], and various mountain herbs.

A simple [[maceration]] of wormwood without distillation produces an extremely bitter drink, due to the presence of the water-soluble [[absinthine]], one of the most bitter substances known. Authentic recipes call for [[distill]]ation after the primary maceration and before the secondary or &quot;coloring&quot; maceration.  The distillation of wormwood, anise, and Florence fennel first produces a colorless [[alcoholate]] which leaves the [[alembic]] at around 82% [[ethanol|alcohol]]. It can be left clear, called a ''la Bleue'' or ''la Blanche'', or the well-known green color of the beverage can be imparted either artificially or with [[chlorophyll]] by steeping Roman wormwood, hyssop, and melissa in the liquid. After this process, the resulting product is reduced with water to the desired percentage of alcohol. Over time and exposure to light the chlorophyll will break down, causing the drink to go from emerald green to yellow green to brown.

Non-traditional varieties are made by cold-mixing herbs, essences or oils in alcohol, with the distillation process omitted.

Alcohol makes up the majority of the drink and is extremely high, between 45% and 89.9%[http://www.drinkfinder.co.uk/showdetails.asp?id=2128], though there is no historical evidence that any commercial vintage absinthe was higher than 74%.  Given the high strength and low alcohol solubility of many of the herbal components, absinthe is usually not imbibed &quot;straight,&quot; but consumed after a fairly elaborate preparation [[ritual]].

Historically, there were five grades of absinthe: ''ordinaire'', ''demi-fine'', ''fine'', ''supérieure'' and ''Suisse'' (which does not denote origin), in order of increasing alcoholic strength. The best absinthes contain 60% to 74% alcohol. It is said to improve materially with storage. In the 19th century, cheap brands of absinthe were occasionally [[adulteration|adulterated]] by profiteers with [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[indigo plant]], or other [[dye]]s to impart the green color, and with [[antimony]] trichloride to produce the ''louche'' effect; this addition of toxic chemicals may have contributed to absinthe's reputation as an unhealthful beverage.

==Preparation==
Traditionally absinthe is poured into a glass over which a specially designed, slotted spoon is placed. A [[sugar]] cube is then deposited in the bowl of the spoon. Ice cold [[water]] is poured or dripped over the sugar until the drink is diluted 3:1 to 5:1. During this process, the components that are not soluble in water come out of solution and cloud the drink; that milky [[opalescence]] is called the ''louche'' (''Fr.'' &quot;opaque&quot; or &quot;shady&quot;).

A modern and more dramatic &quot;[[fire]] ritual&quot; was invented by a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] manufacturer, in which the sugar cube is drenched in [[absinth]] and set on fire. Water is then added to douse the flames and dissolve the caramelized sugar.  Generally, less water is added than in the traditional method.

==History==
The precise origin of absinthe is unclear. According to popular legend, absinthe began as an all-purpose patent [[remedy]] created by Dr. Pierre Ordinaire, a French doctor living in Couvet, [[Switzerland]], around [[1792]] (the exact date varies by account). Ordinaire's recipe was passed on to the Henriod sisters of Couvet, who sold absinthe as a medicinal [[elixir]]. In fact, by other accounts, the Henriod sisters may have already been making the liqueur before Ordinaire's arrival. In either case, one Major Dubied in turn acquired the formula from the sisters and, in 1797, with his son Marcellin and son-in-law Henry-Louis Pernod, opened the first absinthe distillery, Dubied Père et Fils, in Couvet. In 1805, they built a second distillery in Pontarlier, France, under the new company name, Maison Pernod Fils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.absinthebuyersguide.com/history.html &quot;Absinthe History&quot;], from [http://www.absinthebuyersguide.com/ Absinthe Buyers Guide].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Degasabsinthe.jpg|right|thumbnail|''[[L'Absinthe]]'', by [[Edgar Degas]].]]
Absinthe's popularity grew steadily until the [[1840's]] when absinthe was given to French [[troops]] as a [[fever]] preventative.  When the troops returned home they brought their taste for absinthe with them and it became popular at [[bars]] and [[bistro]]s.  

By the [[1860s]], absinthe had become so popular that in most [[café]]s and [[cabaret]]s 5 p.m. signaled ''l'heure verte'' (&quot;the green hour&quot;).  Still, it remained expensive and was favored mainly by the [[bourgeoisie]] and eccentric bohemian artists.  By the 1880s, however, the price had dropped significantly, the market expanded, and absinthe soon became the drink of France. By 1910, the French were consuming 36 million [[liters]] of absinthe per year.

===Ban===
Spurred by the [[temperance movement]] and winemakers' associations, absinthe was publicized in connection with several violent crimes supposedly committed under the direct influence of the drink. This, combined with rising hard liquor consumption due to the [[Phylloxera|wine shortage in France]] during the [[1880s]] and [[1890s]], effectively labelled absinthe as a social menace. Its critics said that ''it makes people crazy and criminal, it turns men into brutes and threatens the future of our times.'' [[Edgar Degas]]'s 1876 painting, ''L'absinthe'' (''The Absinthe Drinkers'') (now at the [[Musée d'Orsay]]) epitomized the popular view of absinthe &quot;addicts&quot; as sodden and benumbed; [[Émile Zola]] described their serious intoxication in his novel ''[[L'Assommoir]]''.

The Lanfray murders spelled the last straw for absinthe.  In [[1905]] it was reported that Jean Lanfray murdered his family and attempted to kill himself after drinking absinthe.  The fact that he was an alcoholic who had drank considerably after the two glasses of absinthe in the morning was forgotten and the murders were blamed solely on absinthe.  A petition to ban absinthe in Switzerland was quickly signed by over 82,000 people.

In [[Switzerland]], the prohibition of absinthe was even written into the constitution in 1907, following a popular initiative.  [[The Netherlands]] came next, banning absinthe in 1909.  Followed by the United States in [[1912]] and finally [[France]] in [[1915]].  The prohibition of absinthe in France led to the growing popularity of ''[[pastis]]'' and ''[[ouzo]]'', other anise-flavored liqueurs that do not use wormwood.

===Modern revival===
[[Image:Absinthe-bottles.jpg|thumbnail|An assortment of modern absinthe.]]
[[Image:tryandfly.jpg|thumbnail|A modern art absinthe poster of 2005]]
In the [[1990s]] an importer, [[BBH Spirits]], realized that there was no [[United Kingdom|UK]] law prohibiting absinthe sale (it was never banned there)&amp;mdash;other than the standard regulations governing [[alcoholic beverage]]. [[Hill's Liquere]], a [[Czech Republic]] distillery founded in 1920, began manufacturing Hill's Absinth, sparking the modern resurgence in absinthe's popularity. This &quot;[[Bohemian]]&quot;-style absinthe, which lacks anise and other herbs, bears little resemblance to the traditional French drink, apart from the inclusion of wormwood and a high alcohol content. It is, however, what many people know as absinthe in some European markets. Hill's claims its absinth is from its own recipe, made popular in the 1930s; however, there is no documentary evidence to support this story.[http://www.oxygenee.com/absintheFAQ6.html]

It had also never been banned in [[Spain]] or [[Portugal]], where it continues to be made. Likewise, the former Spanish and Portuguese New World colonies, especially [[Mexico]], allow the sale of absinthe and it has retained popularity through the years.

France never repealed the 1915 law, but in [[1988]], a law was passed to clarify that only beverages that do not comply with [[European Union]] regulations with respect to thujone content, or beverages that call themselves &quot;absinthe&quot; explicitly, fall under that law. This has resulted in the re-emergence of French absinthes, now labelled ''spiritueux à base de plantes d'absinthe'' (&quot;wormwood-based spirits&quot;). Interestingly, as the 1915 law regulates only the sale of absinthe in France but not its production, some of these manufacturers also produce variants destined for exports which are plainly labeled &quot;absinthe.&quot; [[La Fée Absinthe]], launched in 2000, was the first brand of absinthe distilled and bottled in France since the 1915 ban, initially mainly for export from France, but now one of over twenty French &quot;spiritueux ... d'absinthe&quot; available in Paris and other French cities.  

In [[the Netherlands]] this law was successfully challenged by [[Amsterdam]] wineseller [[Menno Boorsma]] in [[July 2004]], making absinthe once more legal. Subsequently, the government in [[May 2005]] repealed this law.

In Switzerland the ban on absinthe was repealed in [[2000]] during a general overhaul of the constitution, but the prohibition was written into ordinary law instead. Later that law was also repealed, so from [[March 2]], [[2005]], absinthe is again legal in its country of origin, after nearly a century of prohibition. Evidence suggests absinthe has never stopped being produced in Switzerland and clandestine home distillers had produced it since the ban.

Absinthe is once again legal to produce and sell in practically every country where alcohol is legal, the one major exception being the United States.

====Cruise mystery====
In January 2006, a widely published [[Associated Press]] [[wire service]] article echoed the news media's sensationalistic absinthe scare of the early 20th century. It was reported that on the night he disappeared, [[George Allen Smith IV]] (the Greenwich, Connecticut, man who in July 2005 vanished from aboard the [[Royal Caribbean]]'s ''Brilliance of the Seas'' while on his honeymoon cruise) and other passengers drank a bottle of absinthe. The story noted the modern revival and included numerous quotes from various sources, suggesting that absinthe remains a serious and dangerous hallucinogenic drug:

:''&quot;In large amounts it would certainly make people see strange things and behave in a strange manner,&quot; said Jad Adams, author of the book, &quot;Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle.&quot; &quot;It gives people different, unusual ideas which they wouldn't have had on their own accord because of its stimulative effect on the mind.&quot;''

:''&quot;Absinthe is banned in the United States because of harmful neurological effects caused by a toxic chemical called thujone, said Michael Herndon, spokesman for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.''[http://www.greenwichtime.com/news/scn-sa-ct-cruise.1.23jan23,0,1307244.story] [http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2006/01/22/banned_liquor_latest_twist_in_cruise_disappearance/]

The story also noted: &quot;Defenders of the drink say it is safe and its harmful effects a myth.&quot;

Jad Adams and Ted Breaux were interviewed on [[MSNBC]] about this issue.  Ted Breaux had this to say,
:''&quot;one thing we know is that absinthe, old and new, does not contain a lot of thujone.  And what we know, from certain scientific studies, which have been published in the past year or so, is that, first of all, thujone is not present in any absinthe in sufficient concentration to cause any type of deleterious effects in humans.&quot;''[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11007598/]

==Etymology==
The French word ''absinthe'' can refer either to the liquor, or to the actual wormwood plant (''grande absinthe'' being [[Artemisia absinthium]], and ''petite absinthe'' being [[Artemisia pontica]]). The word derives from the Latin ''absinthium'', which is in turn a stylization of the Greek ''αψινθιον'' (apsinthion). Some claim that the word means &quot;undrinkable&quot; in Greek, but it may instead be linked to the [[Persian Language|Persian]] root ''spand'' or ''aspand'', or the variant ''esfand'', which may have been, rather, [[Peganum harmala]], a variety of [[rue]], another famously bitter herb. That this particular plant was commonly burned as a protective offering may suggest that its origins lie in the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*spend'', meaning &quot;to perform a ritual&quot; or &quot;make an offering&quot;. Whether the word was a borrowing from Persian into Greek, or rather from a common ancestor is unclear.

==Controversy==
[[Image:Manet, Edouard - The Absinthe Drinker.jpg|thumb|[[Edouard Manet]], &quot;The Absinthe Drinker.&quot; An unapologetic look at a street bum.]]
It was thought that excessive absinthe-drinking led to effects which were specifically worse than those associated with over-indulgence in other forms of alcohol &amp;mdash; which is bound to have been true for some of the less-scrupulously adulterated products, creating a condition called ''absinthism''. Undistilled wormwood essential oil contains a substance called [[thujone]], which is an [[epilepsy|epileptic]] (and can cause [[renal failure]]) in extremely high doses, and the supposed ill effects of the drink were blamed on that substance in [[19th century]] studies.

The effects of absinthe have been described by artists as mind opening, and even [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] and by prohibitionists as turning good people mad and desolate.  Both are exaggerations.  Sometimes called &quot;secondary effects&quot;, the most commonly-reported is a &quot;clear headed&quot; drunk feeling and thujone was said to be the cause.  The [[placebo effect]] and individual reaction to the herbs makes these secondary effects very subjective and minor compared to the [[psychoactive]] effects of alcohol.

More recent studies have shown that very little of the thujone present in wormwood actually makes it into a properly distilled absinthe, even one re-created using historical recipes and methods.  Most proper absinthe both vintage and modern are naturally within the EU limits. [http://www.feeverte.net/thujone.html] [http://www.emmert-analytik.de/DLR_100_9_S352-356.pdf]  A recent French distiller has had to add pure [[essential oil]] of wormwood to make a &quot;high-thujone&quot; variant of his product. It can remain in higher amounts in oils produced by other methods than distillation, or when wormwood is macerated and not distilled, especially when the plant stems are used, where thujone content is the highest.  

A study in the ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'' concluded that a high concentration of thujone in alcohol has negative effects on attention performance.  It slowed down [[reaction time]] and subjects concentrated their attention in the central field of vision.  Medium doses did not produce a noticeably different effect than plain alcohol. The high dose of thujone in this study was larger than what one can get from current &quot;high thujone&quot; absinthe before becoming too drunk to notice, also, as most people describe the effects of absinthe as a more lucid and aware drunk, this suggests that thujone alone is not the cause of these effects.

The non-French spelling, &quot;absinth&quot; has been adopted for wormwood-based drinks produced in [[Central Europe]] since the beginning of the [[1990s]] (it is now also considered a spelling variant). Although not always the case, these products bear very little resemblance to the traditional French and Swiss absinthe: they are usually bitter and contain little anise, but are marketed to capitalize on the romantic associations and psychoactive reputation of the historical French product. Typically, the low herbal content of these drinks means that they do not produce the louche effect, and as thujone is still associated with the myth of absinthe as a psychoactive drink, many of them advertise a &quot;higher thujone content&quot;.

==Cultural impact==
The legacy of absinthe as a mysterious and addictive, mind-altering drink continues to this day.  Absinthe has been seen or featured in [[fine art]], movies, video, music and literature. The modern absinthe revival has had an effect on its portrayal. It is often shown as an unnaturally glowing green liquid which is set on fire before drinking, even though traditionally neither is true.

===Arts &amp; Literature===
Numerous artists and writers living in France during the late 19th and early 20th century were noted absinthe drinkers and featured absinthe in their work. These include [[Vincent Van Gogh]], [[Manet]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Toulouse Lautrec]], and many others. Degas' painting &quot;L'Absinthe&quot; (1876) portrayed absinthe drinkers in a cafe. [[Picasso]] depicted absinthe in different media, including the paintings &quot;Woman Drinking Absinthe&quot; (1901) and &quot;Bottle of Pernod and Glass&quot; (1912), and the sculpture &quot;Absinthe Glass&quot; (1914). [[Oscar Wilde]] has been quoted as saying, &quot;What difference is there between a glass of absinthe and a sunset?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxygenee.com/absintheFAQ4.html Oxygénée's Absinthe FAQ IV]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--lots more stuff to include here --&gt;

===Movies &amp; TV===
In ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' starring [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Winona Ryder]], Prince Vlad (Oldman) drinks absinthe with Mina/Elizabeta (Ryder) in a London restaurant.  [[Paul Verlaine]] is shown drinking absinthe in the 1995 film ''[[Total Eclipse]]''.  In the 1997 film ''[[Deceiver]]'', [[Tim Roth]]'s character is shown drinking absinthe; the drink's legendary effects are highlighted in the plot.  In the 2001 movie ''[[From Hell]]'', Inspector Abberline ([[Johnny Depp]]) mixes opium with absinthe to make a very addictive drink.  Also produced in 2001, ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' portrayed absinthe as the drink of the Bohemian revolution.  It was used indirectly as the subject of an American independent [[neo-noir]] film, ''[[Bitters and Blue Ruin]]''.  In the beginning of the 2002 movie ''[[XXX]]'', the villians can be seen drinking a green liquid that they set on fire before ingesting. In ''[[Murder by Numbers]]'' (2002), absinthe is prepared by [[Michael Pitt]]'s character, who also gives a speech on its effects and ingredients. In the 2004 movie ''[[EuroTrip]]'', several teenagers purchase a bottle of absinthe at a nightclub in [[Bratislava]]. In the 2004 movie ''[[Van Helsing]]'', Van Helsing finds the Frankenstein monster under a windmill full of absinthe bottles.  In the remake of ''[[Alfie (2004 film)|Alfie]]'' (2004), Liz ([[Susan Sarandon]]) plies the main character ([[Jude Law]]) with absinthe prepared in contemporary style with a sugar cube set on fire. Absinthe also made an appearance in the [[HBO]] television series ''[[Carnivale|Carnivàle]]'', imbibed by a mysterious blind seer, as well as in the [[CBS]] crime drama ''[[C.S.I.]]''. Absinthe was also featured in the episode &quot;The Big Lockout&quot; of the British comedy series [[Black Books]] where character [[Bernard Black]] says, &quot;What do they say, Absinthe, the drink that makes you want to kill yourself.&quot; It was also portrayed in the episode of Friends where Ross wanted to kill Rachel.   In the second series of [[Sky One|Sky One's]] ''[[Hex (TV Series)|Hex]]'', Ella ([[Laura Pyper]]) offers Absinthe to the popular students as means to break the ice whe she enrolls in their school.  She warns the character of Leon ([[Jamie Davis]]) that it &quot;...rots your brain&quot;.

===Music===
Progressive power metal band [[Symphony X]] released &quot;Absinthe And Rue&quot; on their self-titled debut album (1994). The [[John Zorn]]-founded ensemble [[Naked City]] released an ethereal album entitled ''Absinthe'' in 1996. A collaboration between [[Blood Axis]] and [[Les Joyaux De La Princesse]] produced the 2001 [[concept album]] ''[[Absinthe: La Folie Verte]]'', followed up with the live album ''[[Absinthia Taetra]]''. Absinthe appeared in the [[Nine Inch Nails]] video &quot;[[The Perfect Drug]]&quot;. [[Mustis]], the keyboardist from the band [[Dimmu Borgir]], is often pictured with a bottle of absinthe, most notably in their 2003 album, ''[[Death Cult Armageddon]]''. The gothic metal band [[Cradle of Filth]] released a song on 2004's ''[[Nymphetamine]]'', called &quot;Absinthe with Faust&quot;; its opening line is, &quot;Pour the emerald wine into crystal glasses.&quot;  [[Marilyn Manson]] boasts of having written an entire album on absinthe. The famous &quot;One More Saturday Night&quot; logo from the Grateful Dead featured a skeleton swigging absinthe. In the opening number in ''[[Wicked]]'', &quot;No One Mourns The Wicked&quot;, a green elixir turns Elphaba ''[[green]]''.

==Regulations==
Currently, most countries do not have a legal definition of absinthe (unlike, for example, [[Scotch whisky]] or [[cognac (spirit)|cognac]]). Therefore, manufacturers can label a product &quot;absinthe&quot; or &quot;[[absinth]]&quot;, regardless of whether it matches the traditional definition.

===European Union===
The [[European Union]] permits a maximum thujone level of 10 mg/kg in alcoholic beverages with more than 25% ABV and 35 mg/kg in alcohol labeled as bitters.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. [http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scf/out162_en.pdf &quot;Opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on Thujone&quot;], SCF/CS/FLAV/FLAVOUR/23 ADD2 Final [[6 February]] [[2003]].&lt;/ref&gt; Member countries regulate absinthe production within this framework.&lt;!-- needs clarification of EU rulings, dates and details, and also how that applies to the member countries; also, is sale permitted in all EU countries?  --&gt;

====France====
Products explicitly called &quot;absinthe&quot; cannot be sold in France, although they can be produced for export.  Absinthe is now commonly labeled as ''spiritueux à base de plantes d'absinthe'' (&quot;wormwood-based spirits&quot;).  France also regulates Fenchone, a chemical in the herb fennel, to 5 mg/l. [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/ADHJA.htm]

===Switzerland===
To be legally sold, absinthe must be distilled and either uncolored or naturally colored.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], liquor laws are the domain of the provincial governments. [[British Columbia]] has no limits on thujone content, [[Alberta]], [[Ontario]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Quebec]] allow 10ppm thujone, and all other provinces do not allow the sale of absinthe containing thujone (although, in [[Saskatchewan]], you can purchase any liquor available in the world provided you buy a minimum of one case, usually 12 bottles x 750ml or 8 x 1L). The individual liquor boards must approve each product before it may be sold on shelves and currently only Hill's Absinth and, in limited release, La Fée Absinthe are approved. Other brands may appear in the future.

===United States===
[[Image:Affiche absinthe.jpg|thumb|Poster criticising the ban on absinthe in Switzerland.]]
According to [[US Customs]], &quot;The importation of Absinthe and any other liquors or liqueurs that contain ''Artemisia absinthium'' is prohibited.&quot; [http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/vacation/kbyg/prohibited_restricted.xml#Absinthe%20Alcohol] This runs contrary to FDA regulations which allows Artemisia species in food and drink as long as the finished product is thujone free.

Foods or beverages that contain Artemisia species, white cedar, oak moss, tansy or Yarrow must be thujone free.[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/FCF172.html]  Other herbs that contain thujone have no restrictions. For example, sage and sage oil (which can be 50%+ thujone) are on the FDA's list of Substances generally recognized as safe. [http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fcf182.html]

The prevailing consensus of interpretation of [[United States law]] among American absinthe connoisseurs is that:
* It is probably illegal to sell items meant for human consumption which contain thujone derived from ''Artemisia'' species.  This derives from an [[FDA]] regulation (as opposed to a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] regulation).
* It is probably illegal for someone outside the country to sell such a product to a citizen living in the US, given that customs regulations specifically forbid the importation of &quot;absinthe.&quot;
* It is probably legal to purchase such a product for personal use in the US.
* Absinthe can be and occasionally is seized by United States [[Customs (tax)|Customs]], if it appears to be for human consumption.

A faux-absinthe liqueur called [[Absente]], made with ''[[southern wormwood]]'' (''[[Artemisia abrotanum]]'') instead of regular wormwood (''Artemisia absinthium''), is sold legally in the United States. However, the FDA prohibition extends to all ''Artemisia'' species, including even, in theory, ''Artemisia dracunculus'', [[tarragon]]. However, Absente is sold in US retail liquor stores because the export version made for the United States does not contain wormwood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Albert Brooks''' (born [[July 22]], [[1947]]) is a [[United States|American]] [[actor]], [[comedian]] and [[film director|director]].

==Early life==
Brooks was born '''Albert Lawrence Einstein''' in [[Beverly Hills]], [[Los Angeles, California]] to a [[Jewish American]] family. His father, [[Harry Parke|Harry Einstein]], was a comedian who performed on [[Eddie Cantor]]'s [[radio]] program and was known as [[Harry Parke|Parkyarkarkus]]. His mother was actress [[Thelma Leeds]] (born ''Thelma Goodman''). His brother is [[Super Dave Osborne]].

Brooks grew up among showbusiness royalty in southern [[California]], attending high school with [[Richard Dreyfuss]] and [[Rob Reiner]].

==Career==
Brooks attended [[Carnegie Tech]] in [[Pittsburgh]], but dropped out after one year to focus on his comedy career. He changed his surname from ''Einstein'' and began a stand-up comedy career that quickly made him a regular on [[variety show|variety]] and [[talk show]]s during the late [[1960s]] and early [[1970s]]. His onstage persona, that of an egotistical, nervous comic, influenced other comedians, including [[Steve Martin]], [[Martin Mull]] and [[Andy Kaufman]].

After two successful comedy albums, ''Comedy Minus One'' (1974) and the [[Grammy Award]]-nominated ''A Star is Bought'' (1975), Brooks left the standup circuit to try his hand as a filmmaker; his first film, ''The Famous Comedians School'', was a satiric short which appeared on [[PBS]] and was an early example of the [[mockumentary]] sub-genre. In [[1975 in television|1975]], he directed six short films for the first season of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and in [[1976 in film|1976]] appeared in his first mainstream film role, in [[Martin Scorsese|Scorsese]]'s landmark ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (Scorsese allowed Brooks to improvise much of his dialogue). Many of these roles reflected Brooks's decision to move to [[Los Angeles]] to get into the film business.

Brooks directed his first feature film, ''[[Real Life (movie)|Real Life]]'', in [[1979 in film|1979]]. The film, in which Brooks obnoxiously films a typical [[suburb]]an family in an effort to win both an [[Academy_award|Oscar]] and a [[Nobel Prize]], was a sendup of [[PBS]]'s ''[[An American Family]]'' documentary. Brooks also made a brief cameo in the film ''[[Private Benjamin]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]), starring [[Goldie Hawn]].

Through the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]], Brooks co-wrote (with longtime collaborator Monica Johnson), directed and starred in a series of moderately-successful comedies, playing variants on his standard neurotic and self-obsessed character. These include [[1981 in film|1981]]'s ''[[Modern Romance]]'', where Brooks played a film editor desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend, as well as his best-received film, ''[[Lost in America]]'' ([[1985 in film|1985]]), which featured Brooks and [[Julie Hagerty]] as a couple who leave their [[yuppie]] lifestyle, drop out of society and live in a motor home, only to find the disadvantages of [[poverty]].

Brooks's ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' ([[1991 in film|1991]]) placed his lead character in the [[afterlife]], put on trial to justify his human failings and to determine his cosmic fate. Critics responded to the offbeat premise and the surprising chemistry between Brooks and [[Meryl Streep]] as his post-death love interest. His later efforts did not find large audiences, but still retained Brooks's touch as a filmmaker. He garnered positive reviews for ''[[Mother (film)|Mother]]'' ([[1996 in film|1996]]), which starred Brooks as a middle-aged [[writer]] moving back home to resolve his tensions with his mother ([[Debbie Reynolds]]). [[1999 in film|1999]]'s ''[[The Muse]]'' featured Brooks as a down-and-out [[Hollywood]] screenwriter using the services of an authentic muse ([[Sharon Stone]]) for inspiration.

Brooks also acted in other writers and directors' films during the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]]. He moved into the horror genre in one of the stories in ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'', playing an unsuspecting driver who picks up a suspicious hitchhiker ([[Dan Aykroyd]]). In [[James L. Brooks]]'s hit ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]'' ([[1987 in film|1987]]), he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] as an insecure, supremely ethical [[television network|network TV]] [[reporter]]. He also won postive notices for his role in [[1998 in film|1998]]'s ''[[Out of Sight]]'', playing an untrustworthy banker and ex-convict, as well as for his portrayal of a dying retail store owner who befriends disillusioned teen [[Leelee Sobieski]] in ''[[My First Mister]]'' ([[2001 in film|2001]]), and he has appeared as a guest voice on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' five times during its run. Brooks continued his voiceover work in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]), as the voice of &quot;Marlin&quot; the clown fish; &quot;Nemo&quot; is Brooks' largest grossing film to date.

In [[2005 in film|2005]], his film ''[[Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World]]'' drew controversy for its title. [[Sony Pictures]] eventually dropped the film altogether because of their desire to change the title. Subsequently, [[Warner Independent Pictures]] purchased the film and gave it a limited release in [[January 2006]]; the film received mixed reviews and a low box office gross. The movie goes back to the days of Brooks' ''[[Real Life (film)|Real Life]]'', as Brooks once again plays himself, a filmmaker commissioned by the U.S. government to see what makes the [[Muslim]] people laugh, thus sending him on a tour throughout Muslim countries.

==Private life==
Brooks was romantically linked to singer [[Linda Ronstadt]] and actresses [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Julie Hagerty]] and [[Kathryn Harrold]]. He married Kimberly Shlain, a web designer he met while filming &quot;Mother&quot;, on [[March 1997|March 15, 1997]]; the couple have two children, Jacob Eli (born 1999) and Claire Elizabeth (born 2000).

'''Antares''' (&amp;alpha; Sco / &amp;alpha; Scorpii / [[alpha (letter)|Alpha]] Scorpii) is the brightest star in the [[constellation]] [[Scorpius]] and [[list of brightest stars|one of the brightest stars]] in the nighttime sky.  Along with [[Aldebaran]], [[Spica]], and [[Regulus]] it is one of the four brightest stars near the ecliptic.  The similarly colored [[Aldebaran]] lies almost directly opposite Antares in the [[Zodiac]].

Antares' name derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#964;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#951;&amp;#962;'', meaning &quot;(holds) against [[Ares]] (Mars)&quot;, due to the similarity of its [[red]]dish hue to the appearance of the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]]. This distinctive [[color]]ation has made the star an object of interest to many societies throughout history, and many of the old [[Egypt]]ian [[temple]]s are oriented so that the light of Antares plays a role in the ceremonies performed there. Antares was one of the four &quot;[[royal stars]]&quot; of the [[Iran|Persia]]ns around 3000 BC, and some writers claim that it is the &quot;lance star&quot; referred to in the [[Bible|Biblical]] book of [[Book of Job|Job]].  In the religion of [[Stregheria]], Antares is a [[fallen angel]] and [[quarter guardian]] of the [[western gate]]. In astrology Antares is one of the [[Behenian fixed star]]s and has the symbol [[Image:Agrippa1531 corScorpii.png]].

Antares is a [[Stellar classification|class M]] [[giant star]], with a diameter of approximately [[1 E11 m|9.24]] [[scientific notation|&amp;times;]] 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [[kilometre|km]], or slightly more than the distance from the [[Sun]] to Mars, and is approximately 600 [[light year]]s from earth.  Visually, its [[luminosity]] is about 10,000 times that of the [[Sun]] but overall, taking into account that the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the [[infrared]] part of the [[spectrum]] the luminosity jumps to roughly 65,000 times that of the Sun. The mass of the star is calculated to be 15 to 18 [[solar mass]]es. Its large size and relatively smaller mass give Antares a very low density.

The best time to view Antares is on or around [[May 31]] of each year, when the star is at &quot;opposition&quot; to the [[Sun]].  At this time, Antares rises at dusk and sets at dawn, and is thus in view all night.  For approximately two to three weeks on either side of [[November 30]], Antares is not visible at all, being lost in the Sun's glare; this period of invisibility is longer in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] than in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], since the star's [[declination]] is a few degrees south of the [[ecliptic]].

Antares has a hot blue [[companion star]] (Antares B) at a distance of about 2.9&amp;Prime;.  Although it is 5th magnitude, it is normally difficult to see because of Antares' glare, but can be observed with the [[naked eye]] for a few seconds during lunar [[occultation]]s while Antares itself is hidden by the [[Moon]]; it was discovered during one such occultation on [[April 13]] [[1819]].  The [[orbital period]] is 878 years.

Of the 21 first-magnitude stars, Antares now lies further in angular distance from any first-magnitude star than any other first magnitude star, i.e. you could draw the largest circle around Antares without including any other first-magnitude star inside that circle. The nearest first-magnitude star to Antares is [[Alpha Centauri]], lying approximately 39&amp;deg;6.75&amp;prime; away. The high [[proper motion]] of [[Alpha Centauri]] is gradually increasing this distance further. Before about March 2000, [[Alpha_Eridani|Achernar]] and [[Fomalhaut]] held this distinction.

In 1971, the crew of [[Apollo 14]] named their [[lunar module]] after the star.

[[Image:Aldebaran.PNG|thumb|200px|Comparison between Aldebaran and the Sun]]
'''Aldebaran''', (α Tau / α Tauri / [[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]] Tauri), is the brightest star in the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and [[list of brightest stars|one of the brightest stars]] in the nighttime sky. Because of its location in the head of Taurus, it has historically been called the '''Bull's Eye'''.

Its name is derived from Arabic '''&amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1583;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1585;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1606;''' ''ad-dabarān'' meaning &quot;the follower&quot;, a reference to the way the star follows the [[Pleiades (star cluster)|Pleiades]] [[open cluster|star cluster]] in its nightly journey across the sky. Aldebaran has the appearance of being the brightest member of the more scattered [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] cluster, which is the closest star cluster to Earth. However, it is merely located in the line of sight between the Earth and the Hyades, and is actually an independent star.

Aldebaran is a K5&amp;nbsp;III star, which means it is orangish, large, and has moved off of the [[main sequence]] by using all its [[hydrogen]] fuel. It has a minor companion (a dim M2 dwarf orbiting at several hundred [[astronomical unit|AU]]). Now primarily fusing [[helium]], the main star has expanded to a diameter of approximately [[1 E10 m|5.3]] [[scientific notation|&amp;times;]] 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; [[kilometre|km]],  or about 38 times the diameter of the [[Sun]]. The ''[[Hipparcos]]'' satellite has measured it as 65.1 [[light year]]s away, and it shines with 150 times the Sun's luminosity. Taken together this distance and brightness makes it the [[list of brightest stars|14th brightest star]], having an [[apparent magnitude]] of 0.87. It is slightly variable, of the [[irregular variable]] type, by about 0.2 magnitude.

[[Image:Aldebaranrad.JPG|left|thumb|Radio scan of Aldebaranrad, brightness temperature measures at all frequencies]]

In 1997, a possible large planet (or small [[brown dwarf]]) companion was reported, with a mass equalling that of 11 [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]s and orbiting at a distance of 1.35&amp;nbsp;AU.

Aldebaran is one of the easiest stars to find in the [[night sky]], partly due to its brightness and partly due to its spatial relation to one of the more noticeable asterisms in the sky. If one follows the three stars of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]'s belt from left to right (in the Northern Hemisphere) or right to left (in the Southern), the first bright star found by continuing that line is Aldebaran.

The unmanned [[Pioneer 10]] [[spacecraft]] was last reported to have been heading toward Aldebaran.  Assuming the spacecraft avoids some form of [[collision]], the spacecraft will arrive at Aldebaran in 2 million years.

==Aldebaran in astrology and mysticism==
[[Astrology|Astrologically]], Aldebaran is a fortunate star, portending riches and honor. This star, named &quot;Tascheter&quot; by the Persians, is one of the four &quot;[[royal stars]]&quot; of the [[Iran|Persians]] from around [[3000 BC]]. These stars were chosen in such way that they were approximately 6 hours apart in right ascension. To each of these stars was assigned to a season, Aldebaran was prominent in the sky of March and as such, it was associated with the [[vernal equinox]].

The four royal stars with their modern and ancient Persian names:

* Aldebaran (Alpha Tauri) vernal equinox is the brightest star in the constellation Taurus.
* Regulus (Alpha Leonis) summer solstice is the brightest star in the constellation Leo. 
* Antares (Alpha Scorpii) autumnal equinox the brightest star in the constellation Scorpius. 
* Fomalhaut (Alpha Piscis) winter solstice is the brightest star in the constellation Piscis Austrinus.

In Hindu astronomy, Aldebaran corresponds to the [[Rohini Nakshatram|Rohini]] [[Nakshatra]].

To [[medieval]] astrologers it was one of fifteen [[Behenian fixed stars|Behenian stars]], associated with [[rubies]], [[milk thistle]]s and the [[kabbalistic]] sign [[Image:Agrippa1531_Aldaboram.png]].

In the religion of [[Stregheria]], Aldebaran is a [[fallen angel]] and [[quarter guardian]] of the [[eastern gate]].

Some [[Nazi mysticism|Nazi mystics]] believed that the [[Aryan]] race had extraterrestrial ancestors from Aldeberan.

For the Dakotas (a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] branch of the [[Sioux]] tribe), Aldebaran took on a heroic aspect. The young star was the child of the sun and the lady Blue Star. One day he desired to hunt the [[white buffalo]] (the [[Pleiades]]). After he pulled up a sapling to make a spear, a hole was made in the ground and he could see all the people of earth down below.  The white buffalo took this chance to push him through. He was found by an old woman and was to be known as Old Woman's Grandson. On earth he killed many strange monsters which had been troubling the Native Americans; one monster of which was a serpent that caused drought; he killed it releasing a great stream of water that became the [[Mississippi River]]. In time, Old Woman's Grandson remembered the white buffalo and returned to hunting him in the sky to fulfill his destiny.

==Aldebaran in fiction==
Aldebaran is one of several stars mentioned in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], as somehow relating to the god [[Hastur]].

In [[Joe Haldeman]]'s ''[[The Forever War]]'', mankind's first contact with the alien race, later called Taurans, technically occurs near Aldebaran. As the main character explains, ''&quot;&quot;Aldebaranian&quot; is a little hard to handle, they named the enemy &quot;Tauran&quot;.&quot;''

[[Frederik Pohl]]'s ''[[Narabedla Inc.]]'' is partially set on a planet circling Aldebaran.  The title being the name of an Earth Corporation run by human agents of the Aldebaran aliens.  Narabedla is Aldebaran spelled backward.

In [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'', Aldebaran is mentioned once. In 576 thousand million years, right after the Universe has ended, the guests at [[Milliways]], The [[Restaurant]] at the [[end]] of the [[Universe]], will be served with a table of sweets and delicious Aldebaranian [[liqueur]].  In the original radio broadcast, [[Roy Hudd]], playing the Restaurant Host, Max Quordlepleen, mispronounced the name as &quot;Adelbaran&quot;.

In [[Masami Kurumada]]'s ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' Aldebaran is the name of the Taurus Saint, which guards the Taurus pallace at the greek sanctuary where the 12 houses of the Zodiac lay ground. Aldebaran is Brazilian, is the tallest and one of the strongest, wisest warriors in  the sanctuary.

In the novels of [[E. E. Smith]]'s [[lensman|Lensman Series]] Aldebaran's second planet is portrayed as having no native intelligent life, and, being otherwise very Earth-like, attracting large scale human settlement.  This yields a vibrant world with a notably hedonistic culture.

==Aldebaran in media==
Aldebaran (displayed as Al De Baran) is the name of a city in the [[MMORPG]] [[Ragnarok Online]].

Aldebaran of Tauros in the Saint Seya, Japonese Manga end Anime.

Aldebaran is the name of a song by '''[[Enya]]''' on the album ''[[The Celts]]''

'''Altair''' (&amp;alpha; Aql / &amp;alpha; Aquilae  / [[alpha (letter)|Alpha]] Aquilae / Atair ) is the brightest [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] and the [[list of brightest stars|twelfth brightest star]] in the nighttime sky, at [[visual magnitude]] 0.77.

Altair is a [[vertex]] of the [[Summer Triangle]]. It is an &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; type or [[Stellar classification|white star]] located 17 [[light year]]s away from Earth, one of the closest stars visible to the [[naked eye]].

The name &amp;quot;Altair&amp;quot; is [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for &amp;quot;the flyer&amp;quot;, from the phrase '''&amp;#1606;&amp;#1587;&amp;#1585; &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1591;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1574;&amp;#1585;''' ''an-nasr a&amp;#355;-&amp;#355;&amp;#257;?ir'' &amp;quot;the flying eagle&amp;quot;.
The spelling &amp;quot;Atair&amp;quot; is also used frequently.

Altair is most notable for its extremely rapid rotation; by measuring the width of its [[spectral line]]s, it was determined that its [[equator]] does a complete rotation in about 6 1/2 hours (various other sources give 9 hours, or 10.4 hours). In comparison, our star, the [[Sun]], requires a little more than 25 days for a complete rotation.  As a result of its rapid rotation, Altair is [[oblate]]: its equatorial diameter is at least 14 percent greater than its polar diameter.

Altair, along with [[Beta Aquilae]] and [[Gamma Aquilae]], form the well-known line of stars sometimes referred to as the shaft of Aquila.

==References to the star==
In [[Chinese mythology]], there is a love story of [[Qi Xi]] in which Niu Lang ('''Altair''') and his two children (Aquila -&amp;#946; and -&amp;#947;) are separated forever from their mother Zhi Nü ([[Vega]]) who is on the far side of the river, the [[Milky Way]].  The Japanese [[Tanabata]] festival is also based on this legend.

In [[astrology]], the star Altair was ill-omened, portending danger from [[reptile|reptiles]].

In [[computing]], an important early microcomputer, the [[Altair 8800]], was named after the star because the daughter of the man responsible for coming up with a suitable name, when asked what she thought the computer should be called, was watching an episode of ''Star Trek'' where the Starship Enterprise had the star '''Altair''' as its destination. So Altair it was.

In [[science fiction]], Altair is:
* The planet Altair IV is the main setting of the book and film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''
* The homeworld of Harlan, an artificial lifeform in [[Stargate SG-1]]
* The homeworld of the Ancients, an extinct civilization annihilated by the [[Shivans]] eight thousand years ago, in the space-combat simulation game, [[Freespace 2]].
* The homeworld of the [[Alkari]], one of the alien races in the [[Master of Orion]] computer game series.

In [[space travel]], Altair is:

* The [[NASA]] Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) designed to travel to the Moon and International Space Station.

[[Image:Abc-logo.jpg|left|ABC logo|110px]]
The '''Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)''' is [[Australia]]'s national non-commercial [[Public broadcasting|public broadcaster]]. Inaugurated in 1932 as a [[radio network]], the corporation has gradually expanded and diversified into many different broadcasting and print mediums, including [[television]], [[radio]] and [[online]] services. The ABC can be seen and heard throughout metropolitan and regional Australia, and overseas via its Asia-Pacific television service and [[Radio Australia]]. &lt;!--What kind of magazines does ABC publish?--&gt;The corporation publishes magazines, and runs a chain of ABC Shops selling books and audio/video recordings relating to its programming. The ABC is funded almost entirely by direct annual grants from the [[Federal Budget (Australia)|federal budget]], and does not receive income from commercial sources or public donations besides the ABC bookshops.


==History==
===Early period===
[[Image:ABC Perth.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ABC building in Perth, 1937]]
Following the failure of the previous two-tiered system of &quot;A-class&quot; and &quot;B-class&quot; radio licences set up in 1924, the 12 radio stations of the original &quot;A-class&quot; category were nationalised and combined, and the new national broadcaster (based on the [[BBC]] model) was officially incorporated [[1 July]] [[1932]] as the &quot;Australian Broadcasting Commission&quot;. The new national broadcaster was initially permitted to present advertising, but this was removed from the legislation before it came into force. The ABC was funded in part by direct government grant, but drew most of its revenue from listener licence fees.

The radio spectrum was now divided between the ABC and the commercial sector. This new two-tier system became the structural foundation for the industry, and was used as the model for the TV industry in the mid-50s. That arrangement would not change significantly for the next 40 years.

The ABC originally controlled twelve stations around the country: [[2FC]] and [[2BL]] in [[Sydney]], [[3AR]] and [[3LO]] in [[Melbourne]], [[4QG]] in [[Brisbane]], [[5CL]] in [[Adelaide]], [[6WF]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[7ZL]] in [[Hobart]] and the relay stations [[2NC]] in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[2CO]] at [[Corowa]], [[4RK]] in [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]] and [[5CK]] at [[Crystal Brook, South Australia|Crystal Brook]].

Opening day programs on [[1 July]] [[1932]] included the first &quot;Children's Session&quot; with 'Bobby Bluegum'; the first sports program, &quot;Racing Notes&quot; with W.A. Ferry calling the [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]] races; &quot;British Wireless News&quot; received by cable from London; weather; stock exchange and shipping news; the ABC Women's Association session (topics were 'commonsense housekeeping' and needlecraft); a talk on goldfish and their care; &quot;Morning Devotions&quot;; and music.

Over the next four years, these largely isolated stations were gradually brought together into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays, and coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy. During its first decades, the programming schedules included music, news and current affairs, sport, drama, children's programs, and school broadcasts. Because recording technology was still relatively primitive, all ABC programs were broadcast live until 1935, including music. For this purpose, the ABC established broadcasting orchestras in each state, and in some centres employed choruses and dance bands.

In 1934, famed conductor Sir [[Bernard Heinze]] was appointed part-time musical advisor to the ABC. In 1937 the network was further expanded with the purchase of 4BC in Brisbane. In 1939 the ABC began publishing the ''ABC Weekly''.

===World War II===
During the [[World War II |Second World War]], the ABC continued to recruit staff, including a greater proportion of women to replace men who had joined the armed forces. The organisation established reporting and recording facilities in numerous overseas locations, including the Middle East, Greece and the Asia-Pacific region. An early challenge to its independence came in June 1940 when wartime censorship was imposed, and the Department of Information (headed by Sir [[Keith Murdoch]]) took control of the ABC’s 7 p.m. nightly national news. This lasted only until September, when control of the news was returned to the ABC after listeners expressed a preference for independent news presented by the Commission.

During the war, the ABC's [[news program|news bulletins]] attained a reputation for authority and independence, and from 1942 onwards, were broadcast three times daily through all national and most commercial [[transmitters]]. The ABC's ability to speak to all Australians across a huge, sparsely populated country was now recognised as an essential part of the nation's infrastructure. During and after the war, the ABC was given statutory powers that reinforced its independence from the government and enhanced its news-gathering role. From 1946, the ABC was required to broadcast selected parliamentary sessions live, despite the disruption this caused to regular programming.

On [[7 January]] [[1941]] the ABC revived the Children's Session as a national program, including the &quot;Argonauts Club&quot;, which was first broadcast in 1933-34 in Melbourne. The Argonauts Club proved hugely popular with young Australians - by 1950 there were over 50,000 members, with 10,000 new members joining each year in the 1950s. The Club encouraged children's contributions of writing, music, poetry and art, and became one of the ABC's most popular programs, running six days a week for 28 years. 

''The Argonauts Club'' was co-hosted for its entire 31-year run by [[Atholl Fleming]], known to generations of Australians by his on-air names &quot;Mac&quot; and &quot;Jason&quot;. Many notable Australians worked pseudonymously as presenters on the show, including poet [[A.D. Hope]] (&quot;Antony Inkwell&quot;), future ABC General Manager [[Talbot Duckmanton]] (&quot;Tal&quot;) who hosted a weekly sports segment, actors [[Leonard Teale]] (&quot;Chris&quot;) and [[John Ewart]] (&quot;Jimmy&quot;) and future &quot;Mr Sqiggle&quot; host and film producer [[Patricia Lovell]]. Painter [[Jeffrey Smart]] (&quot;Phidias&quot;) commented on art, and popular children's author [[Ruth Park]] contributed dramatised stories. Her main character, which began life as a bunyip, eventually evolved into her beloved &quot;[[Muddle Headed Wombat]]&quot; character, voiced inimitably by Johnny Ewart. Its popularity on The Argonauts led Park to write her popular series of Muddle Headed Wombat books in the 1960s.

In 1942 ''The Australian Broadcasting Act'' was passed, giving the ABC the power to decide when, and in what circumstances, political speeches should be broadcast. Directions from the Minister about whether or not to broadcast any matter now had to be made in writing, and any exercise of the power had to be mentioned in the Commission's Annual Report. It was used only once, in 1963.

Also in 1942, &quot;Kindergarten of the Air&quot; began on ABC Radio in Perth; it was later broadcast nationally and became one of the ABC’s most popular programs.

===Post-war years===
[[Image:Early abc van.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An early ABC [[Outside broadcasting|Outside Broadcast]] van - National Museum of Australia]]
In December 1945, just after the end of the war, the rural affairs program &quot;The Country Hour&quot; premiered. In 1946, legislation was passed requiring the ABC to broadcast Parliament when in session. The parliamentary broadcasts were put onto the interstate network. In subsequent Annual Reports, the Commission commented on the disruption this caused to its programming. Another landmark came on [[June 1]], [[1947]], when the ABC's independent national news service was inaugurated.

During the 1950s, the variety and quantity of programming increased significantly, including light entertainment, sports coverage, talk programs, and features — early forms of what became known as [[radio documentary|documentaries]]. The ABC's coverage of rural affairs was significantly enhanced by the deployment of journalists and broadcasters in major country areas. The increasing availability of [[landline]]s and [[teleprinter]]s allowed the organisation to gather and broadcast news and other program material with much greater efficiency than in the previous two decades. By the 1950s, as many as 13 national news bulletins were broadcast daily. By 1956, the Commission had begun to establish an international presence with offices opening in [[London]], [[New York]] and [[Port Moresby]].

In 1953, the federal ''Television Act'' was passed, providing the initial regulatory framework for both the ABC and commercial television networks. In late 1956, the ABC started regular [[television]] broadcasts from Sydney and Melbourne, just in time to cover the Summer Olympic Games in Melbourne. On November 5, the ABC made its first TV broadcast from its Sydney studios, inaugurated by Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]], and on November 19 the first TV broadcast beamed out from the ABC's Melbourne's studios.

Within a year, ABC-TV was broadcasting from each of the six state capitals. In its first decade, the network developed a wide range of programming that included [[ABC News|news bulletins]], light entertainment, children's and educational programs, and the performing arts. 

By the mid-1960s, [[videotape]] equipment had been installed in all of the ABC's major centres, and during that decade, direct television relays were laid, first from Melbourne to Sydney, and Sydney to Canberra, then between all major centres except for Perth and Hobart. By 1972, all State capitals were linked, allowing simultaneous viewing and national programming. In 1975, colour television was introduced in Australia.

===The 1960s and 70s: growing social and intellectual influence===
The authority and influence of the ABC have been most strongly felt in news and current affairs, in which the organisation's innovations have set the standard for Australian broadcasting. In 1961, ABC-TV started a weekly current affairs program ''[[Four Corners (TV series)|Four Corners]]'', which was characterised by a new, vigorous investigative reporting style of political and social issues that were occasionally ahead of public opinion.

The ABC was one of the first TV networks to embrace the rock'n'roll revolution of the late 1950s, most notably with its pioneering show ''[[Six O'Clock Rock]]'', hosted by [[Johnny O'Keefe]]. During the 60s and early 70s the ABC continued to produce programs on popular music, including the pop show ''Hitscene'', innovative performance specials by groups such as [[Tully (band)|Tully]] and [[Max Merritt &amp; The Meteors]], and the landmark magazine-style program ''[[GTK (TV show)|GTK]]'', which premiered in 1969 and screened for 10 minutes, four nights per week, Monday to Thursday, just before the 7pm news bulletin. 

As well as news, special reports, film clips and interview segments, ''GTK'' was especially notable - and of great historical value - for the inclusion of a nightly segment of specially recorded live in-studio performances by Australian bands. Each week a different band was featured, which would record four songs; in the case of more popular bands, the producers chose tracks other than their hits to demonstrate different aspects of their music. Although it was long thought that most of this priceless material had been erased - like the BBC, an ill-advised &quot;economy drive&quot; in the late 1970s led to the wholesale erasure of large amounts of videotaped material, including most of the first two years of ''[[Countdown (TV show)|Countdown]]''. However, extensive archival research within the ABC following the recent closure of the old [[Gore Hill]] studios in Sydney has revealed that, although some early videotape-only content was erased, much of the primary footage had (fortunately) been shot on film and most of this was retained. It is believed that approximately 80% of ''GTK'' has survived.

In 1967, the weeknight television current affairs program, ''[[This Day Tonight]]'' (TDT), and its counterpart on radio, ''PM'', were introduced. Many people regard these programs, and others like them, to be essential parts of Australian public life, in which politicians and other public figures and organisations were subject to rigorous, though balanced, interviewing and reportage. The ABC also focused on producing radio and television talk programs that explored a wide range of national and international issues. Prominent among these was ''[[The Science Show]]'', which started in 1975 on ABC Radio, hosted by [[Robyn Williams]]. Beginning in the same year was also the prominent radio program, ''Coming out ready or not'' (later known simply as ''The Coming Out Show''), dealing with women's issues. In 1975, colour television was introduced in Australia, and within a decade, the ABC had moved into [[satellite]] broadcasting, greatly enhancing its ability to serve as a national broadcaster.

In 1975, the ABC introduced a 24 hour-a-day AM [[rock (music)|rock]] station in Sydney, 2JJ ([[Double Jay]]), which was eventually expanded into the national [[Triple J]] FM network. A year later, a national [[European classical music|classical music]] network was established on the [[frequency modulation|FM]] band, broadcasting from Adelaide. [[Radio Australia]] continued to thrive as a voice of authority in the Asia-Pacific region.

===The late 20th century to the present===
[[Image:AustralianBroadcastingCorporation1990s.JPG|frame|right|ABC Logo from mid 1990s]]
In 1983, the name of the organisation was changed from 'Commission' to 'Corporation' with the passing of a new ''ABC Act'' by [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]].

During the 1980s, the ABC underwent significant restructuring. Program production in indigenous affairs, comedy, social history and current affairs was significantly expanded. There was considerable pressure on the organisation to increase its production of Australian drama, which trebled from 1986&amp;ndash;91 with the assistance of co-production, co-financing, and pre-sales arrangements. Since this time, ABC dramas have explored numerous themes related to the unique aspects of Australian living; these themes have not been covered by commercial and foreign producers to the same extent, and thus the ABC has played an important role in the evolution of Australia's national identity.

The ABC continued to be active in Australia's music world, chiefly through its six state-based symphony orchestras. The organisation managed an active concert schedule - both orchestral concerts and recitals - in the six state capitals, and coordinated the deployment of the world's prominent soloists in these schedules. However, during the 1980s, there was increasing pressure for the orchestras to be divested; this occurred in ?1990 with the formation of Symphony Australia, an umbrella organisation that coordinates the now independent state-based orchestras.

In the 1980s, the ABC set in motion plans to consolidate its disorganised arrangement of property and buildings in Sydney and Melbourne into single sites in each city. In Sydney, the radio and orchestral operations moved to a single site in Sydney's inner-city suburb of [[Ultimo]] in 1991, joined by ABC-TV operations in ?2002. In Melbourne, the ABC Southbank Centre was finished in 1994, and now houses the radio division in Victoria and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The 1990s saw the expansion of the ABC's network of ABC shops, which sell a wide range of program-related merchandise, including books, [[CD]]s and [[DVD]]s. During the same decade, ''ABC online'' was established as a valuable adjunct to the organisation's broadcasting endeavours. It is now possible for anyone in the world to access a large amount of information, including transcripts and audio and video streams of many programs, on the internet. By the early 1990s, all major ABC broadcasting outlets moved to 24 hour-a-day operation, and regional radio coverage in Australia was extended with 80 new transmitters. Live television broadcasts of selected parliamentary sessions started in ?1995, and [[ABC NewsRadio]], a continuous news network when parliament is not sitting, was launched on [[October 5]], [[1996]]. Australia Television International was established as an authoritative, popular, non-commercial resource in east Asia, and Radio Australia increased its international reach. In 1995, D-Cart digital technology developed by ABC Radio, excited worldwide interest and was sold to European, North American and Asian markets. The ABC used D-Radio, the first fully digital audio system for the first time, broadcasting on Triple J. In the first decade of the new century, the ABC has continued its process of computerising and [[digital|digitising]] production, post-production and transmission. In 2005, [[ABC2]], a digital television channel, was launched.

==Funding and relationship With government==
The ABC receives the vast majority of its funding from the Australian national government, with the exception of all revenue collected through commmercial sales in ABC bookstores. This is in contrast with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and [[public broadcasting in New Zealand]], which receive substantial revenue from advertising, and the British Broadcasting Corporation [[British Broadcasting Corporation|(BBC)]], which receives the bulk of its revenue from [[television licence fee|licence fee]]s and worldwide commercial operations. It is closer in scope to the [[United States|American]] Public Broadcasting Service ([[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]), but backed entirely by government money rather than public donations. Because of the governments financial backing of the broadcasting service, the broadcaster has an interesting relationship with the government. 

Relations between public broadcasters and the governments that provide all or much of their funding, and establish and maintain their legal status, have typically been through periods of turbulence since the rise of current affairs and documentaries in broadcasting. Government control of the ABC besides funding is rather lax; however, the government is responsible for the appointment of people to the board of the ABC. &lt;!--Discuss board appointments--&gt; 

The ABC's treatment of current affairs—including [[This Day Tonight]] and its successors [[The 7.30 Report]] and [[Lateline]] on television, and ''AM'' on radio, have been criticised by the political right for alleged left-wing bias in its reporting. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] government made several attempts to curtail the ABC's political coverage by threatening to reduce funding to the news and current affairs division.&lt;!--Needs evidence ....? Either we need to cite particular instances/times, or refer to another source.--&gt; In the late 1980s, the Hawke Labor government proposed commercialising the ABC, a move that was successfully resisted by the organisation itself and a significant groundswell of devotees among the public. The Hawke government also proposed to merge the ABC and its sister organisation, the Special Broadcasting Service; again, this move was unsuccessful, this time because the enabling legislation failed to pass the Senate. The Howard government reduced the ABC's operating grants by 10% soon after coming to office in 1996. &lt;!--Since then, the ABC has come under pressure for alleged left-wing bias, in particular in relation to its coverage of the war in Iraq ... Alston ... need to make this as NPOV as possible ...--&gt;

==Radio==

The ABC began as a network of 12 radio stations, eight in the captial cities, and four in regional centres.  From its humble beginnings, ABC Radio now includes five national networks, [[Radio National]], [[ABC NewsRadio]], [[Triple J]], [[dig]] and [[ABC Classic FM]]; around fifty [[ABC Local Radio]] stations and a foreign language shortwave radio service, [[Radio Australia]].

The 12 original stations were:

===Radio News and Current Affairs===
The ABC's news and current affairs coverage is the most independent in Australia as it is free of the commercial constraints of the commercial news networks.  It is also widely regarded in the Australian media industry as the best news coverage in the country.
News and current affairs programs broadcast on ABC radio stations across the country are:

* [http://www.abc.net.au/news/ ABC Radio News] (Hourly news updates on Radio National, Local Radio, Classic FM and Triple J)
* [http://www.abc.net.au/am/ AM] (Half hour-long current affairs programme broadcast on Local Radio and Radio National at 8am)
* [http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/ The World Today] (50 minute-long current affairs programme broadcast on Local Radio and Radio National at 12:10pm)
* [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/ PM] (50 minute-long current affairs programme broadcast on Local Radio and Radio National at 6:10pm)
* [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/ Radio National] also produces other news, business &amp; current affairs programmes, such as Background Briefing, the Health, Law, Religion and Media Reports and The National Interest.

===ABC Local Radio===
[[ABC Local Radio]] is the ABC's flagship radio station in each broadcast area.  There are 46 different ABC Local Radio stations across Australia and they all follow a standard format with local hosts presenting light entertainment, talkback, music, sport and interviews.  ABC Local Radio also carries nationally broadcast programming, including AM, PM, [[The World Today]], sporting events and [[Nightlife]].  ABC's local radio stations cater for a diverse audience, but are most popular with older audiences.

===ABC Radio National===
[[ABC Radio National]] can be heard across Australia and broadcasts over 60 special interest programs per week.  These programs are about a diverse range of topics including music, comedy, book readings, radio dramas, poetry, science, health, the arts, religion, social history and current affairs

===ABC NewsRadio===
[[ABC NewsRadio]] was previously called the [[Parliamentary and News Network]] (PNN).  The station was set up to broadcast Australian Federal Parliament and is similar to the [[BBC Parliament]] television channel in the [[UK]].  However, when Parliament is not sitting, the station broadcasts news on a 24/7 format with updates on the quarter hour.  Most of its news comes from [[ABC News]] reporters, however it also uses the resources of [[BBC Radio]], [[NPR]] and [[CNN Radio]].

===Triple J===
[[Triple J]] or JJJ is a national youth radio network, broadcasting new alternative music, particularly Australian music.  The station's demographic is 15-25 years.

===dig===
Dig radio broadcasts over the internet, pay TV and Digital Radio.  It is not available via a standard radio on AM or FM frequency. Dig broadcasts a diverse range of music and also plays music submitted by listeners.

===ABC Classic FM===
[[ABC Classic FM]] was the ABC's first FM service.  It was originally known simply as &quot;ABC FM&quot;, then for a short time &quot;ABC Fine Music&quot;.  Its format borrowed heavily from community stations that eventually founded the [[Fine Music Network]] and also from [[BBC Radio 3]].

The ABC, through ABC Classic FM has helped support the ABC owned state symphony orchestras, chamber music, instrumental recitals, opera, choral and solo singers.

===Radio Australia===
The ABC also operates [[Radio Australia]], an international shortwave service with transmissions aimed at [[East Asia]] and the [[Pacific Islands]], although its signals are also audible in many other parts of the world. It features programs in various languages spoken in these regions, including [[Chinese language|Mandarin]], [[Bahasa Indonesia|Indonesian]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]], and [[Tok Pisin]].  

Radio Australia concentrates on news and current affairs, but it also features historical documentaries, information about Australian lifestyle and culture, and light entertainment. Although it does produce some of its own programming, most of the shows transmitted over Radio Australia are relays of programmes produced by the domestic Radio National network.

Radio Australia bulletins are also carried on the [[World Radio Network]], which is available on satellite in [[Europe]] and [[North America]].

It is of little interest to domestic Australian audiences as most of its material has already been broadcast or is broadcast simultaneously on the easier to receive domestic ABC networks.

==Online==

{{further|[[ABC Online]], [[ABC News Online]]}}

ABC New Media publishes thousands of websites&lt;!--Really? Thousands?--&gt;. Among the most notable are:

===ABC News Online===

ABC News Online has the most comprehensive local news coverage of Australia, publishing stories from the ABC's 36 regional bureau. It also provides extensive national news and international news from an Australian perspective.

===ABC Kids===

One of the best children's sites on the Internet, you can safely sit your kids down in front of The Playground and keep them entertained for hours.&lt;!--'One of the best' is subjective. 'entertained for hours' is subjective. 'safely' is subjective. 'you' is overly informal and unencyclopaedic.--&gt;

===ABC Science Online===

A rambling site, The Lab provides a fantastic gateway into the world of science, including the unique self-service science forum and the best science news from Down Under.&lt;!--'rambling'? 'fantastic'? 'best'? Who writes this stuff?--&gt;

==ABC Enterprises==
ABC Enterprises is the commercial Division of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The Division is comprised of ABC Retail, ABC Consumer Publishing and Content Sales, and ABC Resource Hire. It was established in 1974 with all profits from the sale of consumer product and production services returned to the Corporation to reinvest in program-making.

It now operates over 40 retail shops and 80 centres, an international delivery service on the Internet as well as developing and licensing ABC brands and programs and providing production resource hire to the general public and industry alike. 

===ABC Retail===
The ''ABC Shop Online'' (at http://www.abcshop.com.au) is a shopping website operated by ABC Enterprises.  It sells DVDs, CDs, books, spoken word, toys, clothing, music downloads and mobile/cell phone products related to programming on ABC TV &amp; Radio and Australian culture in general. 

The ''ABC Shops'' (at http://www.abcshop.com.au) sell theatrically released products (DVDS, books, CDs, spoken word, toys and clothing) related to programs broadcast on ABC TV and Radio and related to Australian culture.

===ABC Consumer Publishing &amp; Content Sales===
Develop and license products and brands related to ABC programming selling to both the general public and wholesale TV and radio markets worldwide.

===ABC Resource Hire===
Offer a range of productions services including costume hire, soundstage and studio facilities, venue hire and event staging.

==ABC Logo==
The ABC wavelength logo is one of the most recognisable logos in [[Australia]].  In the early years of television, the ABC had been using [[Lissajous]] figures as fillers in-between programs.  In [[July]] [[1963]], the ABC conducted a staff competition to create a new logo for use on television, stationery, publications, microphone badges and ABC vehicles.  In [[1965]], ABC graphics designer, Bill Kennard, who had been experimenting with telerecording of the Cathode Ray Oscillograph displays, submitted a design which was part of the waveform of an oscilloscope. The letters A-B-C were added to the wavelength design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Mr Kennard was presented with twenty five pounds for his design.

==State orchestras==
In Australia there are currently six State Symphony Orchestras.  These Orchestras were originally formed by the ABC as Broadcast Orchestras.  They have since evolved into platform orchestras and now play a vital role in the cultural life of the country.  The Orchestras were corporatised in the [[1990s]] but continue to be wholly owned by the ABC.  The six orchestras are: The [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]], [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]], [[The Queensland Orchestra]], [[West Australian Symphony Orchestra]], [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra]].

== Postal address ==
The ABC's postal address is &quot;[PO] Box 9994 in your Capital city&quot; followed by the [[List of Australian postcodes|postcode]]. 

It is a persistent [[urban legend]] that '9994' is in memory of the life-time [[cricket|test cricket]] batting average of the Australian cricketer [[Donald Bradman|Sir Donald Bradman]] (he scored 6996 runs in 70 completed innings, an average of 99.94 runs per innings).  Supposedly, one-time Chairman of the ABC, [[Sir Charles Moses]], a personal friend of Bradman's, arranged for this number to be used, however this has been denied by the ABC.

[[Image:Altes Ägypten 003.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Antiquity and modernity stand cheek-by-jowl in Egypt's chief Mediterranean seaport.]]

'''Alexandria''' (Greek '''Aleksándreia''', [[Coptic language|Coptic]] '''Rakotə''', [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الإسكندرية ,tran: '''Al-Iskandariya'''), (population of 3.5 to 5 million), is the second largest city in [[Egypt]], and its most major seaport.  Alexandria extends about 20 miles (32 km) up and down the Mediterranean sea in southwest Egypt. It is home to the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]], the New Library of Alexandria, and is an important industrial centre because of the [[natural gas]] and [[oil pipeline]]s from [[Suez]].

In ancient times, the city was known for the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]]) and the [[Library of Alexandria]] (the largest library in the ancient world). Ongoing [[maritime archaeology]] in the harbor of Alexandria(which began in [[1994]]) is revealing details of Alexandria during the Ptolemaic dynasty.

==History==
The city of Alexandria was named after its founder, [[Alexander the Great]], and as the seat of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] rulers of Egypt, quickly became one of the greatest cities of the [[Hellenistic civilisation|Hellenistic]] world &amp;mdash; second only to [[Rome]] in size and wealth throughout much of antiquity. However, upon the founding of [[Cairo]] by Egypt's medi&amp;aelig;val Islamic rulers, its status as the country's capital ended, and it fell into a long decline, which by the late [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, had seen it reduced to little more than a small fishing village.

===Foundation===
Alexandria was founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in or around [[334 BC]] (the exact date is disputed) as Ἀλεξάνδρεια (''Aleksándreia''; see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]). Alexander's chief architect for the project was [[Deinocrates of Rhodes]]. Ancient accounts are extremely numerous and varied, and much influenced by subsequent developments. One of the more sober descriptions, given by the historian [[Arrian]], tells how Alexander undertook to lay out the city's general plan, but lacking chalk or other means, resorted to sketching it out with grain. Alexander's seers, and in particular [[Aristander of Telmessus]], interpreted this as an omen that the city would prosper, particularly in grain. Other authors make the omen not the grain itself, but the arrival of flocks of birds that ate it. This was at first feared to be an ill omen, but [[Aristander]] the Seer averred it meant that the city would attract and feed many people. In any case, the story explains Alexandria's role as the shipping-point for Egyptian grain, which fed the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] world.

It is believed that Alexandria was the largest city in the world from 320 BC to about 300 BC, when [[Pataliputra]] became the largest.[http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm]

A number of the more fantastic foundation myths are found in the [[Alexander Romance]] and were picked up by medi&amp;aelig;val Arab historians. The [[14th century]] Arab historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] ridiculed one where sea-monsters prevent the foundation, but were thwarted when Alexander descends in a glass box, armed with exact knowledge of their appearance, and goes on to erect metal effigies on the beach which succeed in frightening the monsters away.

Alexandria was intended to supersede [[Naucratis]] as a Greek centre in Egypt, and to be the link between [[Greece]] and the rich [[Nile Valley]]. If such a city was to be on the Egyptian coast, there was only one possible site, behind the screen of the [[Pharos]] island and removed from the silt thrown out by Nile mouths. An Egyptian townlet, Rhacotis, already stood on the shore and was a resort of fishermen and pirates. Behind it there were five native villages scattered along the strip between Lake Mareotis and the sea, according to a history of Alexander attributed to the author known as [[Alexander Romance|pseudo-Callisthenes]].

A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt for the East and never returned to his city. After Alexander departed, his viceroy, [[Cleomenes]], continued the creation of Alexandria.

===Ptolemaic history, to Ptolemy VIII - Centre of Learning===
In a struggle with the other successors to Alexander, his general, Ptolemy (later [[Ptolemy I of Egypt]]) succeeded in bringing Alexander's body to Alexandria, where it became a famous tourist destination for ancient travellers (including [[Julius Caesar]]).

Though [[Cleomenes]] was mainly in charge of seeing to Alexandria's continuous development, the ''[[#Layout of the ancient city|Heptastadion]]''and the main-land quarters seem to have been mainly Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined [[Tyre]] and becoming the centre of the new commerce between [[Europe]] and the [[Arabia]]n and [[India]]n East, the city grew, in less than a generation, to be larger than [[Carthage]] and in a century became the largest city in the world; for some centuries more, it was second only to [[Rome]].  Nominally a free Greek city, Alexandria retained its [[senate]] to Roman times and the judicial functions of that body were restored by [[Septimius Severus]], after temporary abolition by [[Augustus]].

It was not only a centre of [[Hellenism]], but was also the greatest Jewish city in the world. There the [[Septuagint]] was produced. The early Ptolemies kept it in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Greek [[university]] ([[Library of Alexandria]]) but they were careful to maintain the distinction of its population into three nations, &quot;Greek&quot;, Jew and Egyptian. From this division arose much of the later turbulence which began to manifest itself under [[Ptolemy IV of Egypt|Ptolemy Philopater]], who reigned [[221 BC|221]]&amp;ndash;[[204 BC]]. The reign of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]] from [[144 BC|144]]&amp;ndash;[[116 BC]] was marked by purges of Alexandria (including the expulsion of [[Apollodorus]]) and civil warfare surrounding the intrigues among the king's wives and sons.

One of the earliest well-known inhabitants of Alexandria during the Ptolemaic reign was the geometer and number-theorist [[Euclid]].

===Roman interest and annexation - 80 to 30 BC===
The city passed formally under Roman jurisdiction in [[80 BC]], according to the will of [[Ptolemy X of Egypt|Ptolemy Alexander]]: but it had been previously under Roman influence for more than a hundred years. [[Julius Caesar]] dallied with [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]] in Alexandria in [[47 BC]], saw Alexander's body (quipping 'I came to see a king, not a collection of corpses' when he was offered a view of the other royal burials) and was mobbed by the [[rabble]]; his example was followed by [[Marc Antony]], for whose favor the city paid dear to [[Octavian]], who placed over it a prefect from the imperial household.

===Jesus in Alexandria?===
If the story of the [[Flight into Egypt]] is historical, then [[Jesus]], [[Mary]] and [[Joseph]] may have spent time in Alexandria, which had a sizeable Jewish population at the time.

===Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt===
From the time of annexation onwards, Alexandria seems to have regained its old prosperity, commanding, as it did, an important granary of Rome; this fact, doubtless, was one of the chief reasons which induced Augustus to place it directly under [[Roman Empire|imperial power]]. In AD [[215]] the [[Roman Emperors|emperor]] [[Caracalla]] visited the city and for some insulting [[satire]]s that the inhabitants had directed at him, he abruptly commanded his troops to put to death all youths capable of bearing arms. This brutal order seems to have been carried out even beyond the letter, for a general massacre ensued.

===Late Roman history - The Fall of Rome===
Even as its main historical importance had formerly sprung from pagan learning, now Alexandria acquired fresh importance as a centre of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]] and church government. There [[Arianism]] was formulated and where also [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]], the great opponent of both Arianism and pagan reaction, triumphed over both, establishing the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] as a major influence in Christianity for the next two centuries.

As native influences began to reassert themselves in the Nile valley, Alexandria gradually became an alien city, more and more detached from Egypt and losing much of its commerce as the peace of the empire, broke up during the [[3rd century]] AD, followed by a fast decline in population and splendour.

In the late [[4th century]], persecution of [[Paganism|pagans]] by Christians had reached new levels of intensity. Temples and statues were destroyed throughout the Roman empire, pagan rituals forbidden under punishment of death, and libraries closed. In [[391]], Emperor [[Theodosius]] ordered the destruction of all pagan temples, and the Patriarch [[Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus]], complied with his request. It is possible that the great [[Library of Alexandria]] was [[Library of Alexandria#Destruction of the pagan temples by Theophilus|destroyed]] about this time.

The Brucheum and Jewish quarters were desolate in the [[5th century]], and the central monuments, the Soma and Museum, fell into ruin. On the mainland, life seemed to have centred in the vicinity of the Serapeum and Caesareum, both which became Christian churches. The Pharos and Heptastadium quarters, however, remained populous and intact.

===Post-Roman history===
In [[616]] it was taken by [[Khosrau II of Persia|Khosrau II]], King of [[Iran|Persia]]. Although the [[Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Heraclius]] recovered it a few years later, in [[640]] the Arabs, under the general [[Amr ibn al-As]], captured it for good after a siege that lasted fourteen months. The city received no aid from [[Constantinople]] during that time; Heraclius was dead and the new Emperor [[Constantine III of Byzantine Empire|Constantine III]] was barely twelve years old. Notwithstanding the losses that the city had sustained, Amr was able to write to his master, the [[caliph]] [[Omar]], that he had taken a city containing &quot;4,000 palaces, 4,000 baths, 12,000 dealers in fresh oil, 12,000 gardeners, 40,000 Jews who pay tribute, 400 theatres or places of amusement.&quot;

==Geography==
[[Image:alexandria_egypt.jpg|thumb|310px|Alexandria from space, March 1990]]
===Layout of the ancient city===
The Greek Alexandria was divided into three regions:
#'''The [[Jew]]s' quarter''', forming the northeast portion of the city;
#'''Rhakotis, on the west''', occupied chiefly by Egyptians (from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''Rakotə'' &quot;Alexandria&quot;);
#'''Brucheum''', the Royal or Greek quarter, forming the most magnificent portion of the city.
In Roman times Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making up four regions in all.  The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean [[canal]].

Two main streets, lined with [[colonnade]]s and said to have been each about 60 [[metre]]s (200 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]]) wide, intersected in the centre of the city, close to the point where rose the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his [[Mausoleum]]). This point is very near the present mosque of Nebi Daniel; and the line of the great East&amp;ndash;West &quot;Canopic&quot; street only slightly diverged from that of the modern Boulevard de Rosette. Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but better remains of streets and canals were exposed in [[1899]] by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.

Alexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a [[mole (architecture)|mole]] nearly a mile long (1240m) and called the ''Heptastadion'' (&quot;seven stadia&quot; &amp;mdash; a ''[[stadium]]'' was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180m). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where rose the &quot;Moon Gate&quot;. All that now lies between that point and the modern Ras et-Tin quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras et-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbour, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbour. 

In [[Strabo]]'s time, (latter half of [[1st century BC]]) the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbour.
#The Royal Palaces, filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbour on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the &quot;Private Port&quot; and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land subsidence here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.
#The Great Theatre, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by Caesar as a fortress, where he stood a siege from the city mob after the [[battle of Pharsalus]]
#The [[Poseideion]], or [[Temple (Greek)|Temple]] of the [[Poseidon|Sea God]], close to the [[Theatre]]
#The Timonium built by [[Mark Antony]]
#The Emporium (Exchange)
#The Apostases (Magazines)
#The Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the sea-front as far as the mole
#Behind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great [[obelisk]]s, each later known as &quot;[[Cleopatra's Needle]],&quot; and now removed to [[New York City]] and [[London]]. This temple became in time the Patriarchal Church, some remains of which have been discovered; but the actual Caesareum, so far as not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new sea-wall.
#The [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]] and the [[Palaestra]] are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.
#The Temple of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]; site unknown.
#The Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets
#The [[Musaeum]] with its famous [[Library of Alexandria|Library]] and theatre in the same region; site unknown.
#The [[Serapeum]], the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells us that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far to place it near &quot;Pompey's Pillar&quot; which, however, was an independent monument erected to commemorate [[Diocletian]]'s siege of the city.

The names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is no information as to their position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|The Great Lighthouse]], one of The [[Seven Wonders of the World]], reputed to be 138 meters (450 feet) high, was constructed. The first [[Ptolemy]] began it, and the second completed it, at a total cost of 800 [[talent (weight)|talent]]s. It took 12 years to complete and served as a [[prototype]] for all later [[lighthouse]]s in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top. It was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was unfortunately destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest living ancient wonder next to The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].

A temple of [[Hephaestus]] also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole. In the [[Augustus|Augustan]] age the population of Alexandria was estimated at 300,000 free citizens, in addition to an immense number of women, freedmen, children and slaves. The total population has been estimated to range from 500,000 to over 1,000,000 people.

==Ancient remains==
[[Image:Egypt.Alexandria.PompeysPillar.01.jpg|thumb|150px|&quot;Pompey's Pillar&quot;]]
[[Image:DSC00293.JPG|thumb|260px|Qaitbay's Citadel, built in 1477 AD]]
Very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarter has sunk beneath the harbour due to [[earthquake]] subsidence, and much of the rest has been built upon in modern times. &quot;[[Pompey]]'s Pillar&quot; is the most well-known ancient monument still standing. It is located on Alexandria's ancient [[acropolis]] &amp;mdash; a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab [[cemetery]] &amp;mdash; and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its [[pedestal]] it is 30m (99 feet) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, roughly three meters in diameter at the base, tapering to two and a half meters at the top. The structure was plundered and demolished in the fourth century when a bishop decreed that paganism must be eradicated.  &quot;Pompey's Pillar&quot; is a misnomer perpetuated by the Crusaders, as it has nothing to do with Pompey, having been erected in [[293|AD 293]] for [[Diocletian]]. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god [[Serapis]] were enacted, and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library.

Alexandria's [[catacomb]]s, known as &quot;Kom al Sukkfa&quot; are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large spiral staircase, and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other [[syncretism|syncretic]] Romano-Egyptian religious symbols, burial niches and [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased.

The most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as &quot;Kom al Dikka&quot;, and it has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theatre, and the remains of its Roman-era baths.

==Antiquities==
Persistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] Society, and by many individuals, notably Greeks justly proud of a city which is one of the glories of their national history.

The past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations when opportunity offered; [[D. G. Hogarth]] made tentative researches on behalf of the [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in [[1895]]; and a German expedition worked for two years ([[1898]]&amp;ndash;[[1899]]). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria.

[[Image:Caesarion BBC.jpg|left|thumb|Caesarion]] First, since the great and growing modern city stands right over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. Second, the general subsidence of the coast has sunk the lower-lying parts of the ancient town under water.  (This underwater section, containing much of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace-quarter, is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist [http://www.franckgoddio.org Franck Goddio] and his [[underwater archaeology|team]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/203470.stm] and [http://newssearch.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?q=Alexandria+underwater&amp;scope=newsukfs&amp;tab=news].  It raised a noted head of [[Ptolemy XV Caesarion|Caesarion]], left.  These are even being opened up to tourists, to some controversy [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/940333.stm].)

Unfortunately the spaces still most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman strata.

The most important results were those achieved by Dr G Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighbourhood of &quot;Pompey's Pillar,&quot; where there is a good deal of open ground. Here substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Hard by immense [[catacomb]]s and ''columbaria'' have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now lighted by electricity and shown to visitors.

The objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in Kore es-Shugafa Hadra (Roman) and Ras et-Tin (painted).

The Germans found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of Kom ed-Dik, which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea or a Roman fortress.

The making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered. The wealth underground is doubtless immense; but, despite all efforts, there is not much for antiquarians to see in Alexandria outside the museum and the neighbourhood of &quot;Pompey's Pillar.&quot; The native tomb-robbers, well-sinkers, dredgers and the like, however, come upon valuable objects from time to time, which find their way into private collections.

'''Alexandria''' is a city located in [[Madison County, Indiana]].  The population was 715 in [[1890]], 7,221 in [[1900]] out of which 1,002 were foreign-born, and 5,096 in [[1910]]. As of the [[2000]] census, the city had a total population of 6,260.  It is about 46 miles northeast of [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]].

Alexandria is served by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St Louis, and the Lake Erie &amp; Western railways.  In the city are a Carnegie library and Beulah Park of 24 acres (97,000 m&amp;sup2;) &amp; home of the Madison County &quot;4H Fair&quot;.   The city is located in rich farm country, which produces [[maize|Indian corn]], [[oat]]s and [[wheat]]; and is in the [[Indiana]] [[natural gas]] region, to which fact it owes its growth as a manufacturing centre.  It was one of the principal seats of the [[glass]] 
industry in Indiana-- plate glass, lamp chimneys, mirrors, &amp;c., were once manufactured here.  The municipality owns and operates the water-works as well as the city schools.  Alexandria was founded in [[1836]] and was chartered as a city in [[1893]].

Alexandria is also known as &quot;Small Town USA&quot; and holds an annual festival to honor this heritage.
Famous residents include [[Bill and Gloria Gaither]], winners of four Grammys.

Alexandria is home to what is lauded by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's largest ball of paint.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 69.9 [[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]] (27.0 [[square mile|mi&amp;sup2;]]). 68.4 km&amp;sup2; (26.4 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is land and 1.5 km&amp;sup2; (0.6 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is water. The total area is 2.15% water.

Alexandria is on a level plain in the center of the Louisiana [[Longleaf Pine]] [[forest]]s, in which pine is interspersed with various [[hardwood]]s. In the immediate vicinity of the city, [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[alfalfa]] and garden vegetables are cultivated.

==History==
Originally home to a community supporting activities of the adjacent Spanish outpost of Post du Rapides, the area developed as a vibrant yet sometimes debaucherous assemblage of traders and merchants in the agricultural lands bordering the mostly unsettled areas to the north, and providing a link to from the south to the [[Old San Antonio Road|El Camino Real]] and then larger settlement of Natchitoches.  Alexander Fulton, a Pennsylvania businessman, received a land grant from [[Spain]] in [[1785]] and the first organized settlement was made at that time.  In [[1805]]. Fulton and business partner Thomas Harris Maddox laid out the town plan and named the town after Fulton's infant daughter who died around that time.  It was first incorporated as a town in [[1818]] and received a city charter in [[1882]]. 

===The Civil War===

Settled by northerners, home to General Sherman, and having little culturally in common with the majority of the American South, Alexandria found itself in a strange quandary during the American Civil War.  Regardless of political inclinations or loyalties to North or South, its location on the [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]] made the city a major Strategic Target.  In the spring of [[1863]] a Union fleet under [[David D. Porter|Admiral David D. Porter]], operating on the Red River, co-operated with land forces under General N. P. Banks in pushing the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] westward. Alexandria was occupied on [[May 7]], 1863, but the troops were soon withdrawn for the [[Port Hudson]] attack. On [[March 19]], [[1864]] it was again occupied by the Union forces, who made it the point of concentration for another land and naval expedition against [[Kirby Smith|E. Kirby Smith]] and [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. After the check of this expedition and its abandonment, Alexandria was again vacated on the 12th-13th of May, when the city was almost entirely burned, leaving only a few homes owned by friends of Union General Sherman and the city's Cathedral which had been defended from fire squads by a shotgun wielding bishop at its front door. The Union gunboats, which had passed up the river toward Shreveport at high water, were caught in its decline above the falls at Alexandria, but they were saved by a splendid piece of engineering (a [[dam]] at the falls), constructed by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Joseph Bailey]] ([[1827]]-[[1867]]), who for this service received the thanks of Congress and the [[brevet (military)|brevet]] of brigadier-general of volunteers.

== Demographics ==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of [[2000]], there are 46,342 people, 17,816 households, and 11,722 families residing in the city.

'''Alexandria''' is an [[independent city]] in the [[U.S. state|Commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]].  As of the [[2000]] census, the city had a total population of 128,284.  It is located on the west bank of the [[Potomac River]], six miles south of downtown [[Washington, DC]]. 

Like the rest of [[Northern Virginia]], as well as southern Maryland, modern Alexandria has been shaped by its proximity to the nation's [[capital]]. It is largely populated by professionals working in the federal civil service, the U.S. military, or for one of the many private companies which contract to provide services to the federal government. The latter are known locally as [[beltway bandits]], after the [[Capital Beltway]], an interstate highway that circles Washington, D.C. One of Alexandria's largest employers is the U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. Others include the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] and the [[Center for Naval Analyses]].

Alexandria is home to numerous associations, charities, and non-profit organizations including the national headquarters of groups such as the Salvation Army.

The historic center of Alexandria is known as ''Old Town''. It is a major draw for tourists and those seeking nightlife.  Like Old Town, many Alexandria neighborhoods are high-income suburbs of Washington D.C. A 2005 assessed-value study of homes and condominiums found that over 40 percent were in the highest bracket, worth $556,000 or more.

Alexandria landmarks include the [[George Washington Masonic National Memorial]] (also known as the [[Mason]]ic Temple), Gadsby's Tavern, Christ Church, the Little Theatre, the Torpedo Factory, Market Square, Robert E. Lee's boyhood home, the John Carlyle House and the [[Virginia Theological Seminary]]. In 2005, Alexandria became one of the first cities of its size to offer free wireless internet access to some of its residents and visitors. 

Market Square in Old Town was once the site of the second-largest slave market in the United States.  Today it contains a large fountain and extensive landscaping, as well as a weekly farmers' market.

Alexandria's public high school, [[T.C. Williams High School|T.C. Williams]], and its legendary former football coach, Herman &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Boone, were featured in the 2000 motion picture, &quot;[[Remember the Titans]].&quot;

==History==
[[Image:Alexandria Map.gif|thumbnail|275px|right|Map of Alexandria, with [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] to the north, [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax county]] to the south and west, and the [[Potomac River]] to the east]]
The City of Alexandria, first known as Belhaven, was named in honor of John Alexander, who in the last quarter of the [[17th century]] had bought the land on which the city now stands from Robert Howison; the first settlement here was made in [[1695]]. Alexandria was laid out in [[1749]] and was incorporated in [[1779]]. 

A portion of the City of Alexandria shares with all of today's [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] the distinction of having been originally in Virginia, ceded to the U.S. Government to form the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and later reattached to Virginia by the federal government in [[1846]], when the District was reduced in size to exclude the portion south of the [[Potomac River]]. 

From [[1790]] until [[1846]], [[Alexandria County, D.C.|Alexandria County]] was a part of the District of Columbia; the City of Alexandria was re-chartered in [[1852]]. 

The City of Alexandria became independent of Alexandria County in [[1870]]. The remaining portion of Alexandria County changed its name to Arlington County in [[1920]], ending years of confusion.   

''See article on [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]] for more information.'' 

In [[1930]], Alexandria annexed the Town of Potomac.  That town, adjacent to [[Potomac Yard]], had been laid out beginning in the late [[19th century]] and incorporated in [[1908]].

===[[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]===
In [[1755]] General [[Edward Braddock]] organized his fatal expedition against [[Fort Duquesne]] at Alexandria, and here, in April of the same year, the governors of [[Virginia]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Maryland]] met to determine upon concerted action against the [[France|French]] in America.

In March [[1785]], commissioners from Virginia and Maryland met here to discuss the commercial relations of the two states, finishing their business at [[Mount Vernon]] on the 28th with an agreement for freedom of trade and freedom of navigation of the Potomac.  The Maryland legislature in ratifying this agreement on [[November 22]] proposed a conference among representatives from all the states to consider the adoption of definite commercial regulations.  This led to the calling of the Annapolis Convention of 1786, which in turn led to the calling of the Federal Convention of [[1787]].

In [[1790]], Alexandria was included in the area chosen by [[George Washington]] to become the District of Columbia. During the [[War of 1812]], Alexandria surrendered to a British fleet in [[1814]] without a fight. As agreed in the terms of surrender the British looted stores and warehouses of mainly flour, [[tobacco]], [[cotton]], [[wine]] and [[sugar]] [http://oha.ci.alexandria.va.us/archaeology/decades/ar-decades-1810.html].

===Return to Virginia===
Over time, a movement grew to separate from Alexandria from the District of Columbia. As competition grew with the port of [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] and the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] favored the north side of the Potomac, the city's economy stagnated. In addition, many in Alexandra hoped to benefit from land sales and increased business from the federal government, but it had no need for the land south of the river. In addition, its residents had lost representation and the right to vote at any level of government. Alexandria was also an important port and market in the [[slave trade]] there was increasing talk of [[abolition]] of slavery in the national [[capital]], and the economy would suffer greatly if slavery was outlawed. At the same time, there was an active abolition movement in Virginia, and the state's [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]] was closely divided on the question of slavery (resulting in the formation of [[West Virginia]] eighteen years later by the most anti-slavery counties) and Alexandria and Alexandria County would provide two new pro-slavery representatives. After a referendum, voters petitioned Congress and Virginia to return the area to Virginia. The area was retroceded to Virginia by on [[July 9]], [[1846]].[http://www.citymuseumdc.org/gettoknow/faq.asp]

===American Civil War===
At the opening of the [[American Civil War]], the city was occupied by Federal troops until the end of the war, making it the longest held city during the war.  Great excitement throughout the North was caused by the killing ([[May 24]], [[1861]]) of Colonel [[Elmer E. Ellsworth]] (1837-1861) by Captain James W. Jackson, a [[hotel]] proprietor, from whose building Ellsworth had removed a [[Confederate flag]].  After the establishment of the state of [[West Virginia]] in [[1863]], and until the close of the war, Alexandria was the seat of what was known as the &quot;Alexandria Government.&quot;

==Geography==
Alexandria is bounded on the east by the Potomac River, on the north and northwest by Arlington County, and on the south by [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]]. The western portions of the city were annexed from those two entities beginning in the [[1930s]]. 

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 39.9 [[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]] (15.4 [[square mile|mi&amp;sup2;]]).  39.3 km&amp;sup2; (15.2 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is land and 0.6 km&amp;sup2; (0.2 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is water.  The total area is 1.49% water.

===Areas in Alexandria===
====Old Town====
[[Image:Old Town Alexandria.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Old Town Alexandria, viewed from the west, as seen from the observation deck of the [[George Washington Masonic National Memorial]].  [[King Street (Washington Metro)|King Street Station]] is in the foreground, the [[Potomac River]] is in the background]]
Old Town, in the eastern and southeastern areas of Alexandria and on the Potomac River, is the oldest section of the city, originally laid out in [[1749]], and is an historic district.  Old Town is chiefly known for its historic (and expensive) town houses, its art galleries and antique shops, and its restaurants and nightlife, although it is in reality a diverse area that includes substantial public housing.  Old Town is laid out on a [[grid plan]] of substantially square [[city block|blocks]].

====Del Ray====
The area to the northwest of Old Town, formerly in the separate town of [[Potomac, Virginia|Potomac]], is popularly known as Del Ray, although that name properly belongs to one of many communities (including Hume, Mount Ida, and Saint Elmo) in that area.  The housing stock is a mix of single-family houses, duplexes, townhouses, and apartment buildings.

The community has a more [[hipster]] and [[Bohemianism|boho]] flair than Old Town.  While diverse, it has experienced substantial [[gentrification]] since redevelopment began in [[Potomac Yard]] in the mid-[[1990s]].

Del Ray is laid out in a grid plan independent of that of Old Town, with long, narrow blocks.

====West End====
Alexandria's West End includes areas annexed in the [[1950s]].  It is the most typically suburban part of Alexandria, with a [[street hierarchy]] of winding roads and [[cul-de-sac|culs-de-sac]].  The section of [[Virginia State Highway 236|Duke Street]] in the West End is known for a high-density residential area known to locals as the &quot;Condo Canyon&quot; and for its concentration of both strip and enclosed [[shopping mall]]s.

===Addresses===
The [[address (geography)|addressing system]] in Alexandria is not uniform and reflects the consolidation of several originally separate communities into a single city.  In Old Town Alexandria, building numbers are assigned north and south from [[King Street, Alexandria, Virginia|King Street]] and west (only) from the Potomac River.  In the areas formerly in the Town of [[Potomac, Virginia|Potomac]], such as Del Ray and St. Elmo, building numbers are assigned east and west from Commonwealth Avenue and north (only) from King Street.  In the western parts of the city, building numbers are assigned north and south from [[Virginia State Highway 236|Duke Street]].

The [[ZIP code]] prefix 223 uniquely identifies the Alexandria postal area.  However, the Alexandria postal area extends well into [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and includes more addresses outside of the city than inside of it.  Delivery areas have ZIP codes 22301 through 22312, 22314, and 22315, with other ZIP codes in use for [[post office box]]es and large mailers.  ZIP codes are not assigned in any particular geographic order.

==Demographics==
The [[Census Bureau]] designates Alexandria as part of the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area|Washington-Baltimore, DC-MD-VA-WV Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA)]]. 

As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of [[2000]], there are 128,283 people, 61,889 households, and 27,726 families residing in the city.  The [[population density]] is 3,262.9/km&amp;sup2; (8,452.0/mi&amp;sup2;).  There are 64,251 housing units at an average density of 1,634.2/km&amp;sup2; (4,233.2/mi&amp;sup2;).  The racial makeup of the city is 59.79% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 22.54% [[African American]], 0.28% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 5.65% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.09% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 7.38% from [[Race (U.S. Census)|other races]], and 4.27% from two or more races.  14.72% of the population are [[Hispanic American|Hispanic]] or [[Latino]] of any race.

There are 61,889 households out of which 18.6% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 32.2% are [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 9.2% have a female householder with no husband present, and 55.2% are non-families. 43.4% of all households are made up of individuals and 6.8% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older.  The average household size is 2.04 and the average family size is 2.87.

In the city the population is spread out with 16.8% under the age of 18, 9.2% from 18 to 24, 43.5% from 25 to 44, 21.5% from 45 to 64, and 9.0% who are 65 years of age or older.  The median age is 34 years.  For every 100 females there are 93.5 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 91.7 males.

The median income for a household in the city is $56,054, and the median income for a family is $67,023. Males have a median income of $47,514 versus $41,254 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city is $37,645.  8.9% of the population and 6.8% of families are below the [[poverty line]].  Out of the total population, 13.9% of those under the age of 18 and 9.0% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.

==Transportation==
===Roads===
Alexandria is bisected north and south by [[Virginia State Highway 7]], known in most of the city as the major thoroughfare of [[King Street, Alexandria, Virginia|King Street]], and in its western portions as [[Leesburg Pike]].  [[Interstate Highway]] 95/495 (the [[Capital Beltway]]), including the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the Potomac, approximately parallels the city's southern boundary with Fairfax County. [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] crosses through the western part of the city. Other major routes include [[U.S. Highway 1]], named [[Jefferson Davis Highway]] and Patrick and Henry Streets (after [[Patrick Henry]]), the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]], and Duke Street ([[Virginia State Highway 236]]).

===Airports===
Alexandria is located just south of [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]].

===Rail===
[[Union Station (Alexandria)|Alexandria Union Station]], the city's historic [[train station]], is served by both [[Amtrak]] intercity and [[Virginia Railway Express]] [[regional rail]] service. The station is directly adjacent to the [[King Street (Washington Metro)|King Street]] [[Washington Metro|Metrorail]] station, at the convergence of the [[Blue Line (Washington Metro)|Blue]] and [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow Lines]]. Three other Metrorail stations lie within the city limits: [[Braddock Road (Washington Metro)|Braddock Road]], [[Van Dorn Street (Washington Metro)|Van Dorn Street]], and [[Eisenhower Avenue (Washington Metro)|Eisenhower Avenue]].

The traditional boundary between Old Town and the latterly annexed sections of the city followed the [[railroad|railway]] now owned by [[CSX Transportation]].

===Buses===
The city government operates its own [[mass transit]] system, the DASH bus, connecting points of interest with local transit hubs.  [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|Metrobus]] also serves Alexandria.

==Twinning==
Alexandria maintains cultural, economic and educational ties with [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]].

==Recreation==
The city has a distributed [[park]] system with approximately 950 acres spread across 70 major parks and 30 [[recreation centers|recreation center]] of which [[Chinquapin]] is one the largest, offering facilities for swimming, tennis, [[racquetball]] and other sports.  The city also organizes several sports leagues throughout the year including volleyball, softball and basketball.  Alexandria is also unusual in that [[Cameron Run Regional Park]] includes a water park with a [[wave pool]] and [[water slide|water slides]], as well as a [[miniature golf]] course and [[batting cages|batting cage]] -- facilities usually operated by private companies.  A portion of the [[Mount Vernon Trail]], a popular bike path, runs through Old Town near the Potomac River.

==Education==
The city is served by the [[Alexandria City Public Schools]] system and by the Alexandria campus of [[Northern Virginia Community College]].

'''Alexandria Troas''' (&quot;Alexandria of the Troad&quot;, mod. Eski Stambul) is an ancient [[Hellenistic civilization|Greek]] city of the [[Troad]], situated on the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast at nearly the middle of the western side of [[Turkey]], a little south of [[Tenedos]] (modern [[Gökçeada and Bozcaada|Bozcaada]]). It is located in the modern Turkish province of [[Çanakkale Province|Çanakkale]].

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], this site was first called Sigia; perhaps about [[310 BC]] [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]] refounded the city as Antigonia Troas.  Early in the next century the name was changed by [[Lysimachus]] to Alexandria Troas, in memory of [[Alexander the Great]] ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], N.H. 5.124 merely states that the name changed from Antigonia to Alexandria).  As the chief port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, and the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance. [[Strabo]] mentions that a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] colony was created at the location in the reign of [[Augustus]], named Colonia Alexandria Augusta Troas (called simply Troas during this period). Augustus, [[Hadrian]] and the rich grammarian [[Herodes Atticus]] contributed greatly to its embellishment; the aqueduct still preserved is due to the latter. [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] considered making Troas the capital of the [[Roman Empire]].

In Roman times, it was a significant port for travelling between [[Anatolia]] and Europe. [[Paul of Tarsus]] sailed for Europe for the first time from Alexandria ([[Acts]], 16:8-11) and returned there from Europe (and there occurred later the episode of the raising of [[Eutychus]] ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 20:5-12). [[Ignatius of Antioch]] also paused at this city before continuing to Rome (''Ad Philad''. 11.2; ''Ad Smyrn''. 12.1).

Several of its later bishops are known: Marinus in 325; Niconius in 344; Sylvanus at the beginning of the [[5th century|fifth century]]; Pionius in 451; Leo in 787; Peter, friend of the [[Ignatius I of Constantinople|Patriarch Ignatius]], and adversary to Michael, in the ninth century. In the tenth century Troas is given as a suffragan of [[Cyzicus]] and distinct from the famous [[Troy]] (Gelzer, ''Ungedruckte . . .Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum'', 552; ''Georgii Cyprii descriptio orbis romani'', 64); it is not known when the city was destroyed and the diocese disappeared. 

The site [[as of 1911]] was covered with [[vallonea oak]]s, and has been much plundered (for example [[Mehmed IV]] took columns to adorn his new Valideh mosque in [[Istanbul]]), but the circuit of the old walls can be traced, and in several places they are fairly well preserved.  They had a circumference of about six [[English mile]]s, and were fortified with towers at regular intervals.  Remains of some ancient buildings, including a bath and gymnasium, can be found within this area. [[Trajan]] built an aqueduct which can still be traced. The harbour had two large basins, now almost choked with sand.

'''Alexandria''' is a town in [[West Dunbartonshire]], [[Scotland]]. The town is situated on the [[River Leven, Dunbartonshire|River Leven]], four miles north-west of [[Dumbarton]].

As of [[2001]], the population of the town is 13,444. It is the largest town in the [[Vale of Leven]], the others being [[Balloch, Dunbartonshire|Balloch]], [[Renton, Scotland|Renton]], [[Jamestown, Dunbartonshire|Jamestown]] and [[Bonhill]]; their combined population is over 20,000.

The town's traditional industry, most importantly cotton manufacturing, bleaching and printing, have been phased out.  The town was redeveloped in the [[1970s]] with a new town centre layout and traffic system.  Local landmarks include the Christie Park, the Fountain (a traffic junction in the town centre, although there has not been a working fountain there for some years) and what is now Lomond Outlets, a former factory with an impressive dome, which in the early [[1970s]] was the scene of the Plessey sit-in.  The town has the curious distinction of having the only unemployment benefit office in Britain with the insignia of King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]] above the door.

Alexandria sits on the [[A82 road|A82]] main road between Glasgow and [[Loch Lomond]]. There are regular bus services on the route and the town has a train station on the rail line between Balloch and [[Glasgow Queen Street station|Glasgow Queen Street]].

'''Alexandria''' is the capital city of the [[Teleorman County]], [[Romania]]. It is located south of [[Bucharest]], towards the Bulgarian border. The city is situated on the [[Vedea]] River. The city has 58,651 inhabitants.

== Alexandria in 1900 ==
'''Alexandria''' is a town of [[Romania]], situated among the rich corn-lands of the [[Teleorman]] department, on the right bank of the river [[Vedea]].  Its population in 1900 was 13,675.  Its chief trade is in grain, despatched by rail to the Danubian port of [[Zimnicea]], or by river to [[Giurgiu]].  Alexandria was named after its founder, [[Alexandru Ghica]], prince of Romania from 1834 to 1842.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''arithmetic-geometric mean ''' 

:''M''(''x'', ''y'') 

of two positive [[real number]]s ''x'' and ''y'' is defined as follows: we first form the [[arithmetic mean]] of ''x'' and ''y'' and call it ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. 

:''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (''x'' + ''y'') / 2. 

We then form the [[geometric mean]] of ''x'' and ''y'' and call it ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[square root]] of ''xy''.
Now we can iterate this operation with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; taking the place of ''x'' and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; taking the place of ''y''. In this way, two [[sequence|sequences]] (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) are defined:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = \frac{a_n + g_n}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;g_{n+1} = \sqrt{a_n g_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

These two sequences [[limit (mathematics)|converge]] to the same number, which we call the '''arithmetic-geometric mean''' M(''x'', ''y'') of ''x'' and ''y''. 

M(''x'', ''y'') is a number between the geometric and arithmetic mean of ''x'' and ''y''; in particular it is between ''x'' and ''y''. If ''r'' &gt; 0, then M(''rx'', ''ry'') = ''r'' M(''x'', ''y'').

M(''x'', ''y'') is sometimes denoted agm(''x'', ''y'').

=== Implementation ===
The following example code in the [[Scheme programming language]] computes the arithmetic-geometric mean of two positive real numbers:
&lt;pre&gt;
(define agmean
  (lambda (a b epsilon)
    (letrec ((ratio-diff       ; determine whether two numbers
	      (lambda (a b)    ; are already very close together
		(abs (/ (- a b) b))))
	     (loop             ; actually do the computation
	      (lambda (a b)
		;; if they're already really close together,
		;; just return the arithmetic mean
		(if (&lt; (ratio-diff a b) epsilon)
		    (/ (+ a b) 2)
		    ;; otherwise, do another step
		    (loop (sqrt (* a b)) (/ (+ a b) 2))))))
      ;; error checking
      (if (or (not (real? a))
	      (not (real? b))
	      (&lt;= a 0)
	      (&lt;= b 0))
	  (error 'agmean &quot;~s and ~s must both be positive real numbers&quot; a b)
	  (loop a b)))))
&lt;/pre&gt;

One can show that

:&lt;math&gt;\Mu(x,y) = \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot \frac{x + y}{K \left( \frac{x - y}{x + y} \right) }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K''(''x'') is the ''complete [[elliptic integral]] of the first kind''.

The reciprocal of the arithmetic-geometric mean of 1 and the [[Square root of 2]] is called [[Gauss's constant]].

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\Mu(1, \sqrt{2})} = G &lt;/math&gt;

named after [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].

The [[geometric-harmonic mean]] can be calculated by an analogous method, using sequences of geometric and [[harmonic mean|harmonic]] means.  The [[arithmetic-harmonic mean]] is none other than the geometric mean.

'''Akira Toriyama''' (鳥山 明 ''Toriyama Akira'', born on [[April 5]], [[1955]] in [[Kiyosu, Aichi|Kiyosu]], [[Aichi Prefecture]]) is a [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] artist.

He debuted in [[1978]] with the story ''Wonder Island'', published in ''[[Weekly Shonen Jump]]'' magazine, and gained fame for ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', serialized weekly in Shonen Jump from [[1980]] to [[1984]].  

He is probably best known for his series ''[[Dragon Ball]]''. This work was one of the linchpins for what is known as the Golden Age of ''Jump''. Its success &quot;forced&quot; Toriyama to work on ''Dragon Ball'' from 1984 to [[1995]]. During that eleven-year period, he produced 519 chapters, collected into 42 volumes. Each volume has an average of 200 pages, so the entire ''Dragon Ball'' storyline extends to almost 9,000 pages. Moreover, the success of ''Dragon Ball'' led to an animated television series (with a later part of the story known as ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''), feature-length animated [[film|movies]], [[video games]], and mega-merchandising.

His clean line and design sense led to jobs designing characters for the phenomenally popular ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series of [[computer role-playing game|role-playing game]] (formerly called ''Dragon Warrior'' in the United States). He has also served as the character designer for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom/SNES]] RPG ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' and the popular [[fighting game]] ''[[Tobal No. 1]]'' for the [[PlayStation]] (as well as its sequel, ''[[Tobal 2]]'', released only in Japan), and continues to produce the occasional [[manga]] story.

His works after ''Dragon Ball'' tend to be short (100-200 page) stories, including ''[[Cowa!]]'', ''[[Kajika]]'', and ''[[Sandland]]'', as well as one-shots, like the spoof ''[[Neko Majin Z]]''.

He is currently the character designer for a new RPG coming out for the [[Xbox 360]] entitled ''[[Blue Dragon (video game)|Blue Dragon]]''.

The name of Toriyama's studio is ''[[Bird Studio]]'', which is a play on his name, meaning &quot;Bird Mountain&quot;.

'''Epsilon Ursae Majoris''' (&amp;epsilon; UMa / &amp;epsilon; Ursae Majoris) is the brightest [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Ursa Major]] (despite its [[Bayer designation]] being merely &quot;epsilon&quot;), and at [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 1.76 is the [[list of brightest stars|thirty-first brightest star]] in the sky.  It also has the traditional name '''Alioth''' (from the Arabic word ''alyat''&amp;mdash;fat tail of a sheep).

It is the star in the tail of the bear closest to its body, and thus the star in the handle of the [[Big Dipper]] closest to the bowl. It is also a member of the large and diffuse [[Ursa Major moving group]]. Historically, the star was frequently used in maritime navigation.{{ref label|1728|1|^}}

According to ''[[Hipparcos]]'', Alioth is 81 [[light year]]s (25 [[parsec]]s) from [[Earth]]. Its [[spectral type]] is A0p; the &quot;p&quot; stands for peculiar, as the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of its light is quite odd, of a kind characteristic of an [[Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable]]. Alioth, as a representative of this type, is believed to look the way it does because of two interacting processes: first, the star's strong [[magnetic field]] separating different elements salting the star's [[hydrogen]] fuel, then a rotation axis at an angle to the magnetic axis spinning different bands of magnetically sorted elements into the line of sight between Alioth and the Earth. The intervening elements react differently at different frequencies of light as they whip in and out of view, causing Alioth to have very strange [[spectral line]]s that fluctuate over a period of 5.1 days. In the case of Alioth, the rotational and magnetic axes are at almost 90 degrees to one another; in the map of Alioth linked below, note how the darker (more dense) regions of [[chromium]] form a band at right angles to the equator.

For its type, Alioth has a relatively weak magnetic field (15 times weaker than &amp;alpha; CVn's), but it is still 100 times stronger than that of the Earth.

The '''A500''', also known as the '''Amiga 500''', was the first &quot;low-end&quot; [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] [[16-bit]] [[multimedia]] home/[[personal computer]] model.  It was released in [[1987]], at the same time as the high-end [[A2000]], and competed directly against the [[Atari ST|Atari 520ST]]. 

[[Image:Amiga500 system.jpg|thumb|350px|An Amiga 500 computer system, with 1084S RGB monitor and A1010 floppy disk drive.]]

Technical specifications:
* [[Motorola 68000]] (32-bit [[CISC]] microprocessor with 16 registers lacking [[Memory management unit|MMU]] for memory protection and virtual memory) running at 7.16 MHz (NTSC version), 7.09 MHz (PAL version) 
* Default operating system [[AmigaOS]] 1.2 or 1.3 (having 32-bit [[pre-emptive multitasking]] [[microkernel]]) depending on the revision
* 512 [[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Chip RAM]] by default (sound buffers, graphics buffers and software existed in the same memory space)
**upper limit of 16 [[megabyte|MB]] of memory due to MC68000 limitations (24-bit external [[address bus]])
* [[Original Amiga chipset|OCS]]/[[Extended chip set|ECS]] chipset
*50 [[hertz|Hz]] [[PAL]] and 60 Hz [[NTSC]] [[television|TV]] output by default versions available; 50/60Hz mode switchable by software in later revisions
*software-switchable low-pass audio filter (power [[LED]] shows filter status, darker when off)
*[[IRQ]] sharing (like the PCI bus)
*IRQ system had 7 priority levels of [[interrupt]]s
**No limit on number of interrupts available
**Resources handled by Autoconfig, very similar to [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]], resources were not numbered or labelled, just given as amounts and addresses
*No specific [[input/output|I/O]] ports, instead using memory mapped I/O space separately for each hardware device (thanks to [[Jay Miner]])

Amiga 500 was used a lot for gaming, and there were a variety of [[Atari]]-style game controllers that could be used. One of the most popular ones was [[TAC-2]], The Totally Accurate Controller mk2 by [[Suncom]].

----

The '''A500''' designation was also used on an internal [[Acorn Archimedes]] development machine [http://www.drobe.co.uk/riscos/artifact476.html].

The '''A500''' often featured the words &quot;[[The B-52s]] Rock Lobster&quot; written on the motherboard, in reference to the popular song of that time period.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''air force''' is a [[Armed force|military]] organization that primarily operates in [[aerial warfare]]. They typically use a combination of [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[bomber]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[Cargo aircraft#Military Cargo Aircraft|transport planes]] and other aircraft.  Many air forces are also responsible for operations of military space, [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBM), and communications equipment.

==Organization==
Most, but not all, armed forces have air forces that are ''independent'' - that is, it is neither part of the [[army]] nor the [[navy]]. This does not stop armies and especially navies from possessing air arms to support their land or sea operations, although some, such as the [[Canadian Forces Air Command|Canadian Air Force]] operate all military aircraft, even when they are attached to [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command|Canadian Army]] units.

Air Forces typically operate numerous types of aircraft. These may include
* ''[[Fighter aircraft|Fighters]]'', used to destroy other aircraft;
* ''[[Bomber]]s'' and ''Attack Aircraft'', used to attack ground targets;
* ''[[Reconnaissance]] Aircraft'';
* ''[[Electronic Warfare]] Aircraft'';
* ''[[Airborne Early Warning]] Aircraft'';
* ''Transport Aircraft''; 
* ''Tankers'' which provide in-flight re-fuelling for other aircraft;
* ''[[Helicopter]]s'', used for attack, reconnaissance or transport;
* and ''Training Aircraft''.

Air forces also operate numerous types of satellites.  These satellites provide services such as:
* Secure and unsecure communications 
* Position, navigation and timing
* Missile warning
* Weather data
* Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaisance (ISR)

Some air forces such as the British [[Royal Air Force]] have a unique [[Air_force_officer_ranks|rank structure]]; other air forces such as the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) have a [[Ranks_and_insignia_of_NATO_Air_Forces_Enlisted|rank structure on the Enlisted side]] that is unique, but the Officer corps uses [[Ranks_and_insignia_of_NATO_Air_Forces_Officers|Army-style rank]]. And finally there are air forces such as [[Soviet Air Force]] that use Army-style ranks for both Enlisted and Officer corps. Most (but not all) wear blue-grey uniforms pioneered by the Royal Air Force. The organization structures of the air forces also vary: some air forces (such as the [[United States Air Force]] and the [[Royal Air Force]]) are divided into ''commands'', ''groups'' and ''squadrons''; others (such as the [[Soviet Air Force]]) have an Army-syle organizational structure.

Contrary to popular belief, pilots often make up only a small portion of an air force's personnel.  For every pilot, there is a flight crew who supports the air craft, a maintenance group, communications crew, satellite operators, administrative personnel, medical personnel...in truth, although the majority of the senior leadership of most air forces are pilots, the majority of the personnel are not. Some air forces also operate [[anti-aircraft artillery]] (now with [[radar]]s and [[missile]]s), and a few air forces even have their own [[paratrooper]]s. Given the pilots' special status, they often wear special insignia in the form of a [[vol]] or &quot;wings&quot;. Other air crews might wear variations of such insignia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Amiga 1200 with mouse, drives.jpg|right|300px]]
The '''Amiga 1200''', or '''A1200''', was [[Commodore International]]'s third-generation [[Amiga]] computer, aimed at the home market. It was released in October 1992, at a base price of £399 in the [[United Kingdom]] and $599 in the [[United States]].

Like its predecessor, the [[A500]], it featured an all-in-one design incorporating the [[Central processing unit|CPU]], keyboard, and [[disk drive]]s (including, unlike the A500, the option of an internal [[hard disk drive]]) in one physical unit. It shipped with 2 MB of [[Chip RAM]] (and no [[Fast RAM]] as in it's bigger brother the [[A4000]]), Commodore's third-generation chipset, [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]]; and [[AmigaOS]] 3.0. It utilized a [[Motorola]] [[MC68EC020]] [[CISC]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] (a 68020 with 24bit addressing) running at 14.18 MHz [[PAL]] / 14.32 MHz [[NTSC]].  For expansion, the A1200 featured a memory/CPU slot, a [[PCMCIA]] slot and a feature unique to the A1200 - a clockport, a remnant of an abandoned design feature (a real time clock and expandable Chip RAM) which has since been used by third-party expansion boards.

Because the unit's memory was shared between the CPU and the sound and video chips, expanding memory beyond 2 MB greatly increased the A1200's speed. Various third-party accelerators featuring [[Motorola 68020|68020]], [[Motorola 68030|68030]], [[Motorola 68040|68040]], [[Motorola 68060|68060]] and later [[PowerPC]] processors quickly became available to increase the computer's speed further.

Unlike the A500 and A600, which were only incremental upgrades over the original A1000 released in 1985, the A1200 was a significant upgrade, featuring more than four times the processing power and greatly enhanced graphics capabilities. However, the A1200 proved not to be as popular as the A500. Although its graphics capabilities stood up well in comparison to the [[Intel 80386]] and [[Intel 80486|486]]-based [[IBM PC compatible]]s it competed against, many PC clones had more processing power and a lower price, in addition to a larger software library. The Amiga's custom chips were simply more expensive to produce than the commodity chips utilized in PCs, which drove up the A1200's price. In addition, fewer retailers carried the A1200 than earlier Commodore computers, especially in the United States. Although Commodore never released any official sales figures, it is estimated that Commodore shipped fewer than 1 million A1200s worldwide before going bankrupt in April 1994.

The A1200 was re-launched in 1995 after the Amiga assets were sold to Escom, but the new units were priced at 1992 levels and experienced compatibility problems. As of 2003, the A1200 is still being sold by Amiga, Inc., the fourth company to own the rights to the machine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Amiga 1000.jpg|thumb|Amiga 1000 (1985)]]

The '''A1000''', or  [[Commodore_International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] 1000, was Commodore's initial Amiga [[multimedia]] [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]], released in the summer of [[1985]] at an original retail price of US$1,295 without a monitor. A 13-inch analog [[RGB]] monitor was available for around US$300. Before the follow-up [[A500]] and [[A2000]] models were released in 1987, the A1000 was usually just called the '''Amiga'''.

The A1000 had a number of characteristics that distinguished it from later Amigas: It was the only model to feature the short-lived Amiga &quot;checkmark&quot; logo on its case; the case was elevated slightly to give a storage area for the keyboard when not in use (a &quot;keyboard garage&quot;); and the inside of the case was engraved with the signatures of the Amiga designers, including [[Jay Miner]] and the paw print of his dog Mitchy.

Many A1000 owners remained attached to their machines long after newer models rendered the units technically obsolete, and it attracted numerous aftermarket upgrades. Many CPU upgrades that plugged into the [[Motorola 68000]] socket functioned in the A1000. Additionally, a line of products called the ''Rejuvinator'' series allowed the use of newer chipsets in the A1000, and an [[Australia|Australian]]-designed replacement A1000 motherboard called ''The Phoenix'' utilized the same chipset as the A3000 and added an A2000-compatible video slot and onboard [[SCSI]].

== Writable Control Store ==
Because [[AmigaOS]] was rather [[computer bug|buggy]] at the time of the A1000's release, the OS was not placed in ROM. Instead, the A1000 included a [[daughterboard]] with 256 KB of RAM, dubbed the &quot;Writable Control Store&quot; (WCS), into which the operating system was [[booting|booted]] from floppy disk (the disk containing the 256 KB image was called &quot;Kickstart&quot;). The WCS was write-protected after loading, and system resets did not require a reload of the WCS.

== The two versions of the A1000 ==

There were two versions of the Amiga 1000. The first one was sold only in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], had a [[NTSC]] display and lacked the EHB video mode which all other models of the Amiga had. Later versions of this version would have this video mode built in. The second one had a [[PAL]] display, the enhanced video modes (EHB) and was built in [[Germany]].

      <comment>/* Overview */ fixed internal link to [[colon (punctuation)]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''AmigaOS''' is the default native [[operating system]] of the [[Amiga]] and [[AmigaOne]] personal computers.

==Overview==
The main [[modularity (programming)|modularization]] technique in AmigaOS is based on ''libraries'' (files with a &quot;&lt;code&gt;.library&lt;/code&gt;&quot; extension), which are collections of functions much like [[shared library|shared libraries]] in other operating systems, but don't make use of [[dynamic linking]] (this has advantages and disadvantages).

One standard AmigaOS library enjoys a special status: the ''exec.library'' is the only library in the system hooked to a fixed memory address (address 4), and it basically functions as the AmigaOS [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]].

[[Device driver]]s are files with a &quot;&lt;code&gt;.device&lt;/code&gt;&quot; extensions and are basically special libraries with somewhat standardized calls. The higher-level part of device and resource management, however, is deferred to ''handlers'', which are not libraries but [[Task (computers)|task]]s, and communicate by means of [[message passing]].

One important type of handler is a [[filesystem]] handler. The AmigaOS can make use of any filesystem for which a handler has been written, a possibility that has been exploited by programs like [[CrossDOS]] and by a few &quot;alternative&quot; filesystems to the standard [[Amiga Old File System|OFS]] and [[Amiga Fast File System|FFS]]. These filesystems allow one to add new features like [[journaling file system|journaling]] or [[file privilege]]s, which aren't found in the standard OS.

Handlers typically expose a ''device name'' to the [[disk operating system|DOS]], which can be used to access the peripheral (if any) associated with the handler. The ''SPEAK: handler'', offering one of several ways to access the AmigaOS speech synthesis system, is one example of a handler offering services not directly related to a peripheral.

Device names are [[case sensitivity|case insensitive]] (uppercase by convention) strings followed by a [[colon (punctuation)|colon]]. After the colon a ''specifier'' can be added, which gives the handler additional information about ''what'' is being accessed and ''how''. In the case of filesystem, the specifier usually consists of a [[path (computing)|path]] to a file in the filesystem; for other handlers, specifiers usually set characteristics of the desired input/ouput channel (for the ''SER:'' serial port driver, for example, the specifier will contain [[bitrate]], [[Asynchronous start-stop|start and stop bits]], etc).

Filesystems expose ''drive names'' as their device names. For example, ''DF0:'' by default refers to the first floppy drive in the system, while ''DH0:'' is the first hard drive.

Filesystems also expose ''volume names'', following the same syntax as device names: these identify the specific medium in the filesystem-managed drive. If ''DF0:'' contains a disk named &quot;Workbench&quot;, then ''Workbench:'' will be a volume name that can be used to access files in ''DF0:''.

If one wanted to access a file named &quot;Bar&quot; located in directory &quot;Foo&quot; of the disk with name &quot;Work&quot; in drive ''DF0:'', one could write
 DF0:Foo/Bar
or
 Work:Foo/Bar
However, these are not completely equivalent, since when the latter form is used, the system knows that the wanted volume '''is''' &quot;Work&quot; and not just any volume in ''DF0:'', and thus will say something to the effect of
 Please insert volume Work in any drive
whenever a requested file on &quot;Work&quot; is being accessed without volume &quot;Work&quot; being present in any drive.

[[Computer program|Program]]s often need to access files without knowing their physical location (either the drive or the volume): they only know the &quot;logical path&quot; of the file, i.e. whether the file is a library, a documentation file, a translation of the program's messages, etc.

This is solved in AmigaOS by the use of ''assigns''. An assign follows, again, the same syntax as a device name; however, it already points to a directory inside the filesystem. The place an assign points to can be changed at any time by the user. Standard assigns that are generally present in an AmigaOS system include
* ''SYS:'', which points to the boot drive's root directory; this is the only assign created automatically by the kickstart
* ''LIBS:'', pointing to a directory containing the system's libraries, usually SYS:Libs/
* ''DEVS:'', pointing to a directory containing the system's devices, usually SYS:Devs/
* ''C:'', pointing to a directory containing shell commands, usually SYS:C/

==The AmigaOS components==
Until 3.5 release AmigaOS always came divided in two parts, Kickstart and the Workbench.

Each Kickstart version is tied to a particular version of the Amiga's operating system software, so users should only boot Workbench 2.0 on a machine with a 2.0 Kickstart [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. It is possible to boot incorrect versions (Workbench 3.1 will boot on Kickstart 3.0, with some problems). The exception is Workbench 2.1, which works with Kickstart 2.04. Also, the latest Workbench versions, 3.5 and 3.9, use Kickstart 3.1 and load ROM updates at boot time.

===Kickstart===
[[image:Amiga kickstart.png|frame|right|The image shown by '''Amiga OS 1.x''' on startup, asking the user to insert the kickstart [[Floppy disk|disk]].]] 
'''Kickstart''' is the name given to the [[bootstrap]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. On the first [[Amiga]] model, the [[Amiga 1000|A1000]], this was loaded from disk, although eventually the Kickstart was embedded in a ROM chip inside the computer. The Amiga 1000 could be modified to take these chips, and subsequent Amiga models all used ROM chips.

As well as containing the code needed to boot the computer, the Kickstart also contained large portions of the Amiga's operating system&amp;mdash;the portions making up the '''Amiga ROM Kernel'''&lt;!--correct?--&gt;&amp;mdash;such as Intuition (the Amiga's graphical user interface libraries), Exec (its [[preemptive multitasking]] microkernel), and AmigaDOS (the disk handling libraries). The latter based on a [[TRIPOS]] port by [[MetaComCo]] written in [[BCPL]].

Later versions of the Kickstart contained drivers for [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] and [[SCSI]] controllers, [[PCMCIA]] ports and various other hardware that came with Amiga.

With third party [[Computer software|software]], it is possible to have a different Kickstart loaded in RAM and to use it instead of the ROM one - for example Kickstart 1.3 may be loaded in order to run old games incompatible with Kickstart 2.0 and higher. These programs are called ''Softkickers''. There are also hardware ''Kickstart switchers'' which allow you to have more than one set of Kickstart chips inside the computer, which are selectable either by a switch or a keyboard shortcut when you first turn the machine on. It is also possible to swap hardware ROM chips using minimal tools.

===Workbench===
Workbench is the native graphical [[operating system shell|shell]] for the [[Amiga]] computer. As the name suggests, the [[metaphor]] of a workbench, rather than a desktop, is used: directories are depicted as ''drawers'', executable files are depicted as ''tools'', data files are depicted as ''projects'' and GUI widgets are ''gadgets''. Most Amiga application software has [[pull-down menus]] starting &quot;Project Edit ...&quot; rather than the usual &quot;File Edit ...&quot; from other platforms. Strictly speaking, the term ''Workbench'' refers only to the main file-manager of AmigaOS, but it is commonly used in referring to all the parts of the OS not residing in the ROM.

The Workbench environment is not required for the machine to function, therefore a lot of old games can boot directly from Kickstart, without loading it. Most such games don't even let the OS finish the normal booting process; instead, they take over most of the OS itself, disable multitasking, and sometimes run without even ''using'' OS functions.

In many other aspects the interface resembles [[Mac OS]], with the main desktop having the drive icons, and a single menu bar at the very top of the screen. Unlike the contemporaneous Mac [[computer mouse|mouse]], the standard Amiga mouse has two buttons &amp;ndash; the right mouse button operates the pull-down menus, with a Macintosh-style &quot;release to select&quot; mechanism. Later, it was also possible to utilise a mouse with three buttons or a wheel.

A unique feature of Workbench is ''multiple screens''. These are conceptually similar to [[X Window System]] virtual desktops or workspaces, but are generated dynamically by application programs as necessary. Each screen can have a different resolution and colour depth. A gadget in the top-right corner of the screen allows screens to be cycled - as the OS stores all screens in memory simultaneously, redrawing is instantaneous. Screens can also be dragged up and down by their title bars, but this functionality is provided only by the custom chipsets specially designed for the platform, so it is no longer available on systems that run with a modern graphics card.

AmigaOS versions 2.0 and later also support ''public screen''. A public screen works technically like any other screen, but the program that opens it gives it a name within the OS, and other programs can then request the screen by its name, and open their own windows in it.

AmigaOS up to 3.1 doesn't offer any software layer to use additional graphic or audio solutions. Starting with AmigaOS 3.5, some of these solutions were bundled with the OS, allowing the use of common hardware cards other than the native chipsets, but don't include any driver solution of their own. Users are required to use third party software to supply hardware dependent drivers.

====Workbench icons====
The [[icon (computing)|icon]]s that Workbench uses to represent the files in a volume or a drawer are stored in special &lt;code&gt;.info&lt;/code&gt; files, with the name of the &lt;code&gt;.info&lt;/code&gt; file matching the name of the file it represents. For example, the icon for &lt;code&gt;NotePad&lt;/code&gt;, a [[text editor]], is found in the file &lt;code&gt;NotePad.info&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;.info&lt;/code&gt; file includes the graphical representation of the icon and its position in the volume or drawer window. The icon also specifies the type of the file, as used by Workbench. Workbench recognises five different file types:
* Tool: An executable program.
* Project: A data file used by an executable program.
* Drawer: A directory containing files, and other drawers.
* Volume: A physical disk or a [[RAM disk]].
* Garbage: The Trashcan - a deleted file backup, which works in a similar way to the '[[Recycle bin]]' in [[Microsoft Windows]].

Project files can have a default tool assigned to them via the &lt;code&gt;.info&lt;/code&gt; file. Double-clicking on the project icon then starts the specified tool and loads the project into it. This is different from, for example, Microsoft Windows, where the filename extension of the file defines the tool to use.

Tool files can include &quot;tool types&quot; in the &lt;code&gt;.info&lt;/code&gt; file. These are used as configuration options for the program. Each tool type is a single line of text, which can optionally include parameters, written after an &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; sign. Tool types can be commented out by writing them in [[bracket|parentheses]].

The colours used in the icon are normally only stored as indices to the Amiga Workbench screen's current palette. Because of this, the icons' colour scheme is inherently tied to the chosen hues in the screen's palette, and choosing non-standard colours can give the icons an ugly appearance. This problem was party solved by a third-party system called [[NewIcons]], which adds additional features to the standard &lt;code&gt;.info&lt;/code&gt; files. Unlike normal Workbench icons, NewIcons include actual [[RGB]] colour information, and the system tries its best to match the icons' colour hues to those in the screen palette.

===ARexx===
:''Main article: [[ARexx]]''
The Amiga OS had support for the Rexx language. It was called ARexx (short for &quot;Amiga Rexx&quot;) and was a script language which allowed for full OS scripting, similar to BASH on Linux, intra-application scripting, similar to VBA in Microsoft Office, as well as inter-program communication.  Having a single scripting language for any application on the operating system was beneficial to users, instead of having to learn a new language for each application.

Programs could listen on an &quot;ARexx port&quot; for string messages. These messages could then be interpreted by the program in a similar fashion to a user pushing buttons. For example, an ARexx script when run in an email program, could save the currently displayed email and invoke an external program which could extract and process information and then invoke a viewer program. This allowed applications to control other applications, send data back and forth directly with memory handles, instead of saving files to disk then reloading.

===Ram Disk===
The Amiga OS has the only dynamically sized RAM disk, which would resize itself automatically to its contents.  Operating System configuration files were loaded into the RAM disk on boot, greatly speeding operating system usage.  Other files could be copied to the RAM disk like any standard device for quick modification and retrieval.

The Amiga OS also had support for a fixed-capacity recoverable RAM disk, which functioned as a standard RAM disk, but could maintain its contents on restart.

==AmigaOS versions==
===Kickstart/Workbench 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3===
[[Image:Amiga Workbench 1 3 large.png|thumb|200px|Workbench 1.3]]
The 1.''x'' versions are the original implementation of AmigaOS. They defaulted to a distinctive blue and orange colour scheme which was designed to give high contrast on even the worst of television screens (it could easily be changed by the user). Versions 1.1 consisted mostly of bug fixes. Versions 1.0 and 1.1 were distributed only on floppy disks for the Amiga 1000.

Version 1.2 was the first to have Kickstart on a [[Read-only memory|ROM]] and Workbench on one or two [[Floppy disks#The Commodore Amiga|floppy disks]]. Workbench was then booted from floppy disk or installed on a hard disk on later machines. The early Kickstarts were still available on floppies for Amiga 1000 owners. These versions were shipped in ROM with the [[A500]], [[A1500]], [[CDTV]] (1.3 only) and [[A2000]]. Version 1.2 of Kickstart fixed many bugs, greatly improving the stability of the system, and added [[AutoConfig]] support which could automatically configure expansion boards. Release 1.3 had few changes to Kickstart (mainly to enable autobooting hard disks) but had many improvements in Workbench, including a much faster file system for hard disks, an improved CLI, and various extra programs.

====AmigaBASIC and ABasiC====
:''Main article: [[AmigaBASIC]]''
Version 1.1 shipped with AmigaBASIC, a [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] implementation designed by [[Microsoft]] (this was the only software ever written by Microsoft for the Amiga).

AmigaBASIC was discontinued with the launch of Kickstart/Workbench 2.x.

Version 1.0 shipped instead with a different BASIC language, called [[ABasiC]]. Where AmigaBASIC was oriented around creating graphical user interfaces, ABasiC was more similar to the BASIC interpreters shipped with older 8-bit systems, and was geared towards text based applications.

===Kickstart/Workbench 1.4===
Kickstart/Workbench 1.4 was a [[Software testing#Beta testing|beta]] version of the upcoming 2.0 update and never released, but the Kickstart part was shipped in very small quantities with early [[A3000|Amiga 3000]] computers, where it is often referred to as the &quot;[[Superkickstart]] ROM&quot;. In these machines it is only used to bootstrap the machine and load the Kickstart that will be used to actually boot the system. The appearance is similar to that of 2.0 and higher, with just minor differences. It is, however, possible to dump out of the OS selection screen by clicking where one would expect to see a close gadget. This will cause the machine to boot Kickstart 1.4 using either the wb_2.x: partition, or from a floppy.

===Kickstart/Workbench 2.0, 2.05, 2.1===
[[Image:Amiga Workbench 2.gif|right|Workbench 2]]
Kickstart/Workbench 2.0 introduced a lot of major advances to the Amiga operating system. Gone was the harsh blue and orange colourscheme, replaced with a much easier on the eye grey and light blue. The Workbench was no longer tied to the 640×256 (PAL) or 640×200 (NTSC) display modes, and much of the system was improved with an eye to making future expansion easier. For the first time, a standardised &quot;look and feel&quot; was added. This was done by creating the Amiga Style Guide, and including libraries and software which assisted developers in making conformant software. Technologies included the GUI element creation library ''gadtools'', the software installation scripting language ''Installer'', and the ''AmigaGuide'' hypertext help system.

Workbench 2.04 introduced ARexx, a system-wide scripting language. Programmers could add so-called &quot;ARexx ports&quot; to their programs, which allowed them to be controlled from ARexx scripts. Using ARexx, you could make two completely different programs from different vendors work together seamlessly. For example, you could batch-convert a directory of files to thumbnail images with an ARexx capable image manipulation program, create and index HTML table of the thumbnails linking to the original images, and display it in a web browser, all from one script. ARexx became very popular, and was widely adopted by programmers.

The AmigaDOS, previously written in [[BCPL]] and very difficult to develop for beyond basic file manipulation, was mostly rewritten in [[C programming language|C]].

Unfortunately, some badly written software &amp;ndash; especially games &amp;ndash; failed to run with 2.x, and so a lot of people were upset with this update. Most often, the failure occurred because programmers had used directly manipulated private structures maintained by the operating system, rather than using official function calls.

2.x shipped with the A500+ (2.04), A600 (2.05), A3000 and A3000T. Workbench 2.1 was the last in this series, and only released as a software update. It included useful features such as [[CrossDOS]], to support working with floppy disks formatted for [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]s. Since 2.1 was a software-only release, there was no Kickstart 2.1 ROM.

2.x also introduced PCMCIA card support, for the slot on the A600.

===Kickstart/Workbench 3.0, 3.1===
[[Image:Amiga Workbench 3.gif|thumb|Amiga Workbench 3]]
3.x was another major update. Updates included:

* A universal data system, known as datatypes, that allowed programs to load pictures, sound and text in formats they didn't understand directly, through the use of standard plugs (''see'' [[object-oriented operating system]])
* A system-standard localization system, allowing the user to make an ordered list of ''preferred languages''; when a locale-aware application runs, it asks the operating system to find the ''catalog'' (a file containing translations of the application's string) best matching the user's preferences
* Colour remapping for low-colour display modes
* Improved visual appearance
* Better support for background images

3.x shipped with the [[Amiga CD32|CD32]], [[A1200]], [[A4000]] and A4000T.

===AmigaOS 3.5, 3.9===
[[Image:AmigaOS 3 9 Workbench.jpg|thumb|Workbench 3.9]]
After the demise of Commodore, the later owners of the Amiga trademark granted a license to a [[Germany|German]] company called [[Haage &amp; Partner]] to update the Amiga's operating system. Along with this update came a change in the way people referred to the Amiga's operating system. Rather than specifying &quot;Kickstart&quot; or &quot;Workbench&quot;, the updates were most often referred to as simply &quot;AmigaOS&quot;.

Updates included:
* CD filesystem support as standard
* Distribution on CD instead of floppy disk
* Supplied with [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] stack, web browser, and e-mail client
* Improved GUI, called &quot;ReAction&quot;
* AVI/MPEG movie player (OS3.9)
* Support for hard disks larger than 4Gb (a limitation from 1.x)
* HTML documentation
* MP3 and CD audio player (OS3.9)
* Dock program (OS3.9)
* Improved Workbench
* Find utility (OS3.9)
* ASync workbench (no more waiting for files to be copied)

===AmigaOS 4===
A new version of AmigaOS is being developed by [http://www.hyperion-entertainment.biz Hyperion Entertainment] under license from [http://www.amiga.com Amiga, Inc]. The 4.0 version will be a major update a decade after the last official release.

The new version will be [[PowerPC]] native, finally abandoning the [[Motorola]] [[68k]] [[central processing unit|processor]].  Since there is no more [[68000]] based Amiga hardware, AmigaOS 4.0 will run on [[PowerPC]] hardware, which currently only includes [[A1200|1200]] and [[A4000|4000]] with PowerPC accelerator boards and [[AmigaOne]] motherboards. Amiga, Inc.'s distribution policies for AmigaOS 4.0 and any later versions requires that for third party hardware the OS must be bundled with it, with the sole exception of Amigas with Phase 5 PowerPC accelerator boards, for which the OS will be sold separately. 

As of February 2005, there were two license holders. The first being the company that was consulted by Amiga, Inc. to create this distribution model, [http://www.eyetech.co.uk Eyetech], who currently offer [http://www.mai.com/ Mai Logic]'s [http://www.mai.com/products/Mainboard.htm Teron series motherboards] under the licensed label &quot;AmigaOne&quot;, and the second being ACK Software Controls, who are creating PowerPC motherboards that can be connected to the Amiga 1200 for improved backward compatibility. 

A developer pre-release version was sent to purchasers of AmigaOne hardware in June of 2004, and currently ships with new AmigaOne boards. This does not have all of the features planned for the full release version, but includes a full [[SDK]] based on [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]], and VBCC C/C++ compilers.

Main features planned for AmigaOS 4.0:
* Tripos legacy code finally removed
* Improved TCP/IP networking
* Fully skinnable GUI
* Virtual memory
* Limited memory protection
* CD/DVD writer support, including [[Mount Rainier (packet writing)|Mt. Rainier]]
* Integrated debugger
* Integrated viewer for PDF and other document formats
* Enhanced shared library model
* Support for PowerPC (native) and 68k (emulated JIT) applications
* Improved input device support
* Support for modern hardware devices
* New USB stack
* New PCI stack
* New interface module (replaces the jump table of classic AmigaOS)
* Stack enlargement
* Resource tracking
* Faster memory allocation system, similar to what’s used on Solaris 
* 2 GB file limit removed 
* New version of AmiDock with plug in support
* New CDFilesystem with Joliet and HFS support, DVDRW support
* HDToolbox replacement
* New HD Recovery tool
* Added support for Truetype and Postscript fonts, with optional anti-aliasing

==AmigaOS influence on other Operating Systems==
AmigaOS has spawned at least two &quot;clone&quot; operating systems over time.

[[AROS]], or ''Amiga Research Operating System'' is an attempt to clone the AmigaOS API in a portable open-source operating system. Although not binary compatible with AmigaOS (unless running on 68k), it is reported to be highly sourcecode compatible.

[[MorphOS]] is a PowerPC native operating system, originally created when the future of the Amiga looked uncertain. It provides binary compatibility with system-friendly AmigaOS applications.

Although not strictly Amiga related, a recent fork of [[FreeBSD]]-4.8 called [[DragonFly BSD]] has been created by a former FreeBSD developer and Amiga programmer Matt Dillon. DragonFly BSD (although still a work in progress) aims to make the BSD core more like the Amiga architectually, featuring a message-passing kernel, allowing for a very efficient and virtually [[Mutual exclusion|mutex]]-free SMP design.

==Trivia==
Some versions of AmigaOS included [[copyright]] messages as [[Easter eggs (virtual)|Easter eggs]] that required some trickery to access.
* In version 1.x, by holding down both Shift keys and both Alt keys and pressing the function keys F1 through F10, you could see copyright messages in the title bar. As an example, pressing F10 resulted in the message &quot;Moral support: [[Joe Pillow and the Dancing Fools]]&quot;.
* In versions 2.x and 3.0, the secret message was accessed by repeatedly selecting the &quot;About...&quot; option from the Workbench menu, and leaving the resulting [[dialog box]] open. When there were enough (approximately 20) dialog boxes open at the same time, the next one had a secret message instead of the normal one. In version 3.1 the secret message was openly integrated into the &quot;About...&quot; dialog box.

An '''asymptote''' is a straight or curved [[line (mathematics)|line]] which a curve will approach arbitrarily closely.

[[image:1-over-x.png|thumb|320px|In the graph of 1/x, the x and y axes are the asymptotes.]]
A specific example of asymptotes can be found in the [[graph of a function|graph]] of the [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'', in which two asymptotes are being approached: the line ''y'' = 0 and the line ''x'' = 0.  A curve approaching a [[vertical]] asymptote (such as the preceding example's ''x'' = 0, which has an undefined [[slope]]) could be said to approach an &quot;[[limit (mathematics)|infinite limit]],&quot; while a curve approaching a [[horizontal]] line (such as the previous example's ''y'' = 0) could be said to approach a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] at infinity.

[[image:1-over-x-plus-x.png|thumb|320px|In the graph of (1/x)+x, the y-axis and the line x=y are both asymptotes.]]

Asymptotes need not be parallel to the ''x''- or ''y''-axis, as shown by the graph of ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is asymptotic to both the ''y''-axis and the line ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''.  When an asymptote is not parallel to the ''x''- or ''y''-axis, it is called an oblique asymptote.

Asymptotes, especially vertical asymptotes, also not need to go to infinity when approached at both sides.  Asymptote x=a is a vertical asymptote for f(x) if it just satisfies ''at least one'' of the following conditions:

# &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a-} f(x)=\infty&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a+} f(x)=\infty&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a-} f(x)=-\infty&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a+} f(x)=-\infty&lt;/math&gt;

Note that ''f''(''x'') need not be undefined at ''a''. For example, consider the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} 1/x &amp; x \neq 0 \\ 5 &amp; x = 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

As both &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0+} f(x) = \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0-} f(x) = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;, ''f''(''x'') has a vertical asymptote at 0, even though &lt;math&gt;f(0) = 5&lt;/math&gt;.

A function ''f''(''x'') can be said to be '''asymptotic''' to a function ''g''(''x'') as ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin;. This has any of four distinct meanings:

# ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''g''(''x'') &amp;rarr; 0.
# ''f''(''x'') / ''g''(''x'') &amp;rarr; 1.
# ''f''(''x'') / ''g''(''x'') has a nonzero limit.
# ''f''(''x'') / ''g''(''x'') is bounded and does not approach zero. See [[Big O notation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dr. '''Andrew Stuart &quot;Andy&quot; Tanenbaum''' (born 1944) is a [[professor]] of [[Computer Science]] at [[Vrije Universiteit]], [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. He is best known as the author of [[Minix]], a free [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]] for teaching purposes, and for his [[computer science]] textbooks. He regards his teaching job as his most important work.{{ref|teach}}[[Image:AndrewTanenbaum.jpg|frame|right|Andrew S. Tanenbaum]]

He was born in [[New York City]] and raised in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains, NY]].  He received his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Physics]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].   He received his [[doctorate]] from [[UC Berkeley]] in 1971.  He and his wife moved to the Netherlands (her homeland), but he retains his United States citizenship.  [[As of 2004]] he teaches courses about Computer Organization and Operating Systems, and supervises the work of [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] candidates.

He is well recognized for his textbooks on computer science, which are famous as standard texts in the field, particularly:
* ''Computer Networks,'' ISBN 0130661023
* ''Operating Systems: Design and Implementation,'' ISBN 0136386776
* ''Modern Operating Systems,'' ISBN 0130313580

He also wrote:
* ''Structured Computer Organization,'' ISBN 0131485210
* ''Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms,'' ISBN 0130888931

''Operating Systems: Design and Implementation'' and Minix were [[Linus Torvalds]]' inspiration for the [[Linux]] kernel. In his autobiography ''[[Just For Fun]]'', Torvalds describes it as &quot;the book that launched me to new heights&quot;. Tanenbaum started a famous, inflammatory [[Usenet]] discussion with Torvalds [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/browse_thread/thread/c25870d7a41696d2/3f6b594a5b4eccb4] about the [[microkernel]], but Linus and Andrew appear to be on good speaking terms; Linus wants it understood that he holds no animosity towards Tanenbaum. Tanenbaum went on to write the [[Amoeba distributed operating system]], making full use of the microkernel idea.

In 2004 Tanenbaum created [[electoral-vote.com]], a popular web site analyzing [[opinion polls]] for the [[2004 U.S. Presidential Election]], using them to project the outcome in the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]]. The site also provided an electoral map. Surprising results on this map (such as, for example, a short period when Hawaii, traditionally Democratic, was listed as &quot;Barely Bush&quot;) would often surface in popular discussion. Through most of the campaign period he kept his identity secret, referring to himself as &quot;the Votemaster&quot; and acknowledging only that he personally preferred [[John Kerry|Kerry]].  Tanenbaum, a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], revealed his identity on [[November 1]], [[2004]], the day prior to the election, also stating his reasons and qualifications for running the website [http://www.electoral-vote.com/2004/info/votemaster-faq.html].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Ariane 5 Rosetta launch large.jpg|right|250px|thumb||'''Ariane 5''' lifts off with the [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta probe]] on 2 March 2004.]]
'''Ariane 5''' is an [[expendable launch system]] designed to deliver satellites into geostationary transfer orbit and to send payloads to low earth orbit.

It was manufactured under the authority of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) with [[EADS SPACE Transportation]] as prime contractor, leading a consortium of sub-contractors. The rocket is operated and marketed by [[Arianespace]] as part of the [[Ariane]] programme. [[EADS SPACE Transportation]] builds the rockets in [[Europe]] and [[Arianespace]] launches them from a space port at [[Kourou]] in [[French Guiana]].

It succeeded [[Ariane 4]], but does not derive from it directly. Its development took 10 years and cost [[Euro|€]]7 billion. The ESA originally designed Ariane 5 to launch the manned mini shuttle [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]], and thus intended it to be &quot;human rated&quot; from the beginning. After the ESA cancelled Hermes, the rocket became a purely commercial launcher.

Two satellites can be mounted using a Sylda carrier.  Three main satellites are possible depending on size.  Up to eight secondary payloads, usually small experiment packages or minisatellites, can be carried with an ASAP (Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads) platform.

==Components==
Ariane 5’s [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] H158 main stage (H173 for Ariane 5 ECA) is called the EPC (Étage Principal Cryotechnique/Cryogenic First Stage). It consists of a large tank 30.5 [[metre]]s high with two compartments, one for 130 [[tonne]]s of [[liquid oxygen]] and one for 25 [[tonne]]s of [[liquid hydrogen]], and a Vulcain engine at the base with thrust of 115 [[tonne-force|tonnes-force]] (1.13 [[meganewton]]s). This part of the first stage weighs about 15 tonnes when empty.

Attached to the sides are two solid propellant boosters, P238 (P241 for Ariane 5 ECA), each weighing about 277 tonnes full. Each delivers a thrust of about 630 tonnes-force (6.2 MN). These boosters can be recovered with parachutes, like the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]s. They may have been retrieved for examination on early missions, but are not reused.

The second stage is on top of the main stage and below the payload.  The Ariane 5G uses the EPS (Étage à Propergols Stockables/Storable Propellant Stage), which is fueled by [[monomethylhydrazine]] (MMH) and [[nitrogen tetroxide]], where the Ariane 5 ECA uses the ESC (Étage Supérieur Cryotechnique/Cryogenic Upper Stage), which is fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The payload and all upper stages are covered at launch by the fairing, which splits off once sufficient altitude has been reached.

==Variants==
[[Image:1esaatv.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ATV will be delivered into orbit by an Ariane 5 rocket]]
The original version is dubbed Ariane '''5G''' (Generic) with a launch mass of 737 tonnes. Its payload capability to [[Geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO) was initially specified as 5970 [[Kilogramme|kg]], but was increased after the qualification flights to 6200kg.

The Ariane '''5G+''' had an improved second stage, with a GTO capacity of 6950kg for a single payload. It flew three times in 2004.

It was replaced in 2005 by the Ariane '''5GS''', with 5 ECA solid boosters.

The Ariane 5 '''ECA''' has a GTO launch capacity of 10,000 kg for dual payloads or 10,500 kg for a single payload. This variant uses a new Vulcain 2 first-stage engine, and an ESC-A second stage, powered by an HM-7B engine, weighing 6,500 kg and carrying 14,000 kg of cryogenic [[Spacecraft propulsion|propellant]].  The second stage was previously used as the third stage of Ariane 4; in ECA use, the tanks are modified to shorten stage length.  The revised Vulcain has a longer, more efficient nozzle with more efficient flow cycle and denser propellant ratio.  The new ratio demanded length modifications to the first-stage tanks.  Also, the solid booster casings have been lightened with new welds, and packed with more propellant. The ESC-A cryogenic second stage does not improve the performance to [[Low Earth orbit]] compared to Ariane 5G, and for this reason the Ariane 5 ECA will not be used to launch the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] (ATV).

'''Comparable rockets:'''
[[Delta IV rocket|Delta IV]] -
[[Atlas V rocket|Atlas V]] -
[[Long March 5 rocket family|Chang Zheng 5]] -
[[Angara rocket|Angara]]

==Future developments==
Ariane 5 '''ES ATV''' has been designed for launching the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]]. It consists of the improved Vulcain 2-powered first stage and the upper stage from the Ariane 5G, and can put up to 21,000 kg in [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]].

==Cancelled developments==
Ariane 5 '''ECB''' was planned to have a ESC-B upper stage using a new &quot;Vinci&quot; [[expander cycle (rocket)|expander cycle]] type engine. The GTO capacity was to increase to 12,000 kg, but ECB was put on hold due to budget cuts.  It was cancelled outright in May 2005 due to lack of demand in that payload range. The Vinci engine which was to power ECB's upper stage is still being developed, albeit at a lower pace. The cancellation of ECB creates a major commercial weakness for Ariane 5 : lacking a reignitable cryogenic engine, contrary to all its competitors, it is unable to deliver payloads directly to [[Geostationary orbit|GEO]].

==Launch history==
[[Image:000nasa.ariane5.gif|thumb|right|200px|Comparison of Ariane 5 to [[Proton rocket|Proton]] and [[Soyuz launch vehicle|Soyuz]] rockets]]

Ariane 5's first test flight ([[Ariane 5 Flight 501]]) on [[4 June]] [[1996]] failed, with the rocket self-destructing 37 seconds after launch because of a malfunction in the control software, which was arguably one of the most expensive [[computer bug]]s in history. A data conversion from 64-[[bit]] [[floating point]] to 16-bit [[signed]] [[integer]] value had caused a processor trap (operand error). The floating point number had a value too large to be represented by a 16-bit signed integer. Efficiency considerations had led to the disabling of the software handler (in [[Ada programming language|Ada]] code) for this trap, although other conversions of comparable variables in the code remained protected.

The second test flight, L502 on [[30 October]] [[1997]] was a partial failure.  The Vulcain nozzle caused a roll problem, leading to premature shutdown of the core stage. The upper stage operated successfully but could not reach the intended orbit.

A subsequent test flight on [[21 October]] [[1998]] proved successful and the first commercial launch occurred on [[10 December]] [[1999]] with the launch of the [[XMM-Newton]] X-ray observatory satellite.

Another partial failure occurred on [[12 July]] [[2001]], with the delivery of two satellites into an incorrect orbit, at only half the height of the intended GTO. The ESA Artemis [[telecommunications satellite]] was able to reach its intended orbit on [[31 January]] [[2003]], through the use of its experimental [[ion propulsion]] system.

The next launch did not occur until [[1 March]] [[2002]], when the [[Envisat]] [[environmental satellite]] successfully reached an orbit 800 km above the Earth in the 11th launch. At 8111 kg, it was the heaviest single payload to date.

The first launch of the ECA variant on [[11 December]] 2002 ended in failure when a main booster problem caused the rocket to veer off-course, forcing its self-destruction three minutes into the flight. Its payload of two communications satellites (Stentor and [[Hot Bird]] 7), valued at about EUR 630 million, was lost in the ocean. The fault was determined to have been caused by a leak in coolant pipes allowing the nozzle to overheat. After this failure, Arianespace SA delayed the expected January 2003 launch for the [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta]] mission to [[26 February]] [[2004]], but this was again delayed to early March 2004 due to a minor fault in the foam that protects the cryogenic tanks on the Ariane 5. 

On [[27 September]] [[2003]] the last Ariane 5 G boosted three satellites (including the first European lunar probe, [[SMART-1]]), in Flight 162. On [[18 July]] [[2004]] an Ariane 5 G+ boosted what was at the time the heaviest telecommunication satellite ever, [[Anik]] F2, weighing almost 6,000 kg.

The first successful launch of the Ariane 5 ECA took place on [[12 February]] [[2005]]. The payload consisted of the XTAR-EUR military communications satellite, a 'SLOSHSAT' small scientific satellite and a MaqSat B2 payload simulator. The launch had been originally scheduled for October 2004, but additional testing and the military requiring a launch at that time (of an [[Helios 2A]] observation satellite) delayed the attempt.

On [[11 August]] [[2005]], the first Ariane 5GS (featuring the Ariane 5 ECA's improved solid motors) boosted Thaïcom-4/iPStar-1, the heaviest telecommunications satellite to date at 6505 kg [http://www.skyrocket.de/space/index_frame.htm?http://www.skyrocket.de/space/doc_sdat/ipstar-1.htm], into orbit.

On [[13 October]] [[2005]], the second Ariane 5GS boosted a dual payload to orbit. This consisted of Syracuse 3A, a French military satellite, and Galaxy 15 for [[PanAmSat]].

On [[16 November]] [[2005]], the third Ariane 5 ECA launch (the second successful ECA launch) took place. It carried a dual payload consisting of Spaceway-F2 for [[DirecTV]] and Telkom-2 for PT Telekomunikasi of Indonesia. This was the rocket's heaviest dual payload to date, at more than 8000 kg.

On [[21 December]] [[2005]], the third Ariane 5GS boosted another dual payload to orbit. This payload consisted of INSAT 4A for the  Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), and MSG-2 for the European organization Eumetsat.

Founded in [[1980]], '''Arianespace SA''' undertakes the production, operation and marketing of the [[Ariane 4]] and [[Ariane 5]] rocket launchers as part of the [[Ariane (rocket)|Ariane]] programme. 
[[As of 2002]] Arianespace held more than 50 percent of the world market for boosting satellites to [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO), although the consortium has had a deteriorating market share due to poor initial performance by the Ariane 5 launch vehicle. More than 130 commercial launches have occurred since [[May 22]], [[1984]].  

Arianespace utilises a launch site at [[Kourou]] in [[French Guiana]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] '''500 Plus''', ('''A500+''') is a enhanced version of the original [[A500|Amiga 500]].
 
The A500+ featured:
* [[Motorola 68000]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] running at 7.09 MHz (PAL) / 7.16 MHz (NTSC), like its predecessor.
* 1MB of [[Chip RAM]] (Very early versions comes with 512KB)
* [[Kickstart]] 2.04 (v37.175)
* [[AmigaOS|Workbench]] 37.67 (release 2.04)
* Built in battery backed RTC (Real Time Clock) (lacking in the A500)
* Full [[Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]] Chipset including new version of the [[Agnus]] chip and [[Original_Amiga_chipset#Denise|Denise]] chip. 

The A500+ was officially introduced in [[1992]], however the plus was released in near secrecy, masquerading as A500 units in late [[1991]]. It has been speculated that Commodore had already sold out the remaining stocks of A500s, before the run up to the profitable Christmas sales period. In order to make enough A500's before Christmas, Commodore used stocks of the new 8A revision motherboards destined for the A500+. Many users were unaware that they were purchasing anything other than a standard A500. Although the A500+ was an improvement to the A500, it was minor, making it the shortest lived Amiga model. It was discontinued and replaced by the [[A600|Amiga 600]] in summer [[1992]].

Commodore created the A500+ for a couple of reasons. The first was cost reduction; minor changes were made to the motherboard to make it cheaper to produce. It was also so that Commodore could introduce the new version of the [[AmigaOS|Amiga Operating system]], 2.04.

Due to the new [[Kickstart]], quite a few popular games failed to work on the A500+, and a lot of people took them back to dealers demanding an original [[Kickstart]] 1.3 [[A500]]. This problem was solved by third-parties who produced Kickstart [[Read-only memory|ROM]] [[switching boards]], that could allow the A500+ to be downgraded to Kickstart 1.2 or 1.3. It also encouraged game developers into better programming habits, something that was essential as when the A500+ was launched, Commodore already had plans for the introduction of the next-generation [[A1200]] computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''The article is about a computer processor register.  For other uses of'' accumulator'', please see [[accumulator]].''

In a [[computer]] [[central processing unit|CPU]], an '''accumulator''' is a [[processor register|register]] in which intermediate [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic and logic]] results are stored. Without a register like an accumulator, it would be necessary to write the result of each calculation (addition, multiplication, shift, etc.) to [[primary storage|main memory]], perhaps only to be read right back again for use in the next operation. Access to main memory is slower than access to a register like the accumulator because the technology used for the large main memory is slower (but cheaper) than that used for a register.

The canonical example for accumulator use is summing a list of numbers. The accumulator is initially set to zero, then each number in turn is added to the value in the accumulator.  Only when all numbers have been added is the result held in the accumulator written to main memory or to another, non-accumulator, CPU register.

Modern CPUs usually have many registers, all or many of which may be capable of being used for calculations.  The characteristic which distinguishes one register as being the accumulator of a [[computer architecture]] is that the accumulator (if the architecture were to have one) would be used as an ''implicit'' [[operand]] for arithmetic [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s.  For instance, a computer might have an instruction like:

      ADD ''[[memory address|memaddress]]''

This instruction would add the value read from the memory location at ''memaddress'' to the value from the accumulator, placing the result in the accumulator.  The accumulator is not identified in the instruction by a register number; it is implicit in the instruction and no other register can be specified in the instruction.

Some architectures use a particular register as an accumulator in some instructions, but in other instructions use register numbers for explicit operand specification.  The common [[x86]] microprocessor architecture is like this: the AX register is an accumulator (implicit operand) in some arithmetic instructions, but in other arithmetic instructions AX is one of several registers which can be specified.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Abuzubaydah.jpg|right|frame|Abu Zubaydah is the highest-ranking [[al-Qaida]] leader in U.S. custody]]
'''Abu Zubaydah''' ([[12 March]] [[1971]] - present) ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: &amp;#1575;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1608; 
&amp;#1586;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1583;&amp;#1577;) 
was a high-ranking member of [[al-Qaida]] and close associate of [[Osama bin Laden]]. He is currently in U.S. custody in an unknown location. Zubaydah's name is often [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Abu Zubaidah''', '''Abu Zubeida''', or '''Abu Zoubeida'''. Born '''Zein al-Abideen Mohamed Hussein''' (Arabic: &amp;#1586;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1606; &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1593;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1583;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1606; &amp;#1605;&amp;#1581;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1583; &amp;#1581;&amp;#1587;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1606;), he is also known by over thirty-five [[alias]]es.

Born in [[Saudi Arabia]], Zubaydah has been close to al-Qaida all his life, helping to operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border between [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] in the early 1990s.  He became an associate of [[Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi]], and served as a chief recruiter for al-Qaida.

In the late 1990s, Zubaydah played a lead role in one of the [[2000 millennium attack plots]], and a possible tangential role in a second. There were plans to bomb a fully booked [[Radisson]] hotel in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]], and three other sites. This targeted tourists from the [[United States]] and [[Israel]]. But on [[November 30]], [[1999]], Jordanian intelligence intercepted a call between Zubaydah and [[Khadr Abu Hoshar]], a [[Palestinian]] militant, and determined that an attack was imminent. Jordanian police arrested 22 conspirators and foiled the attack. Zubaydah was sentenced to death [[in absentia]] by a Jordanian court for his role. There is also evidence that Zubaydah approved the Los Angeles airport bomb plot in 2000. This plot was also foiled.

In March of [[2001]], [[United States]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] was informed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] that Zubaydah was planning a major operation in the near future. This was one of the first of many reports in the Spring of 2001 that increased the threat level and indicated that an attack was coming. Many of these reports mentioned Zubaydah by name. The attack finally came in the form of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. 

The U.S. government believes he became al-Qaeda's top military strategist following the death of [[Muhammad Atef]] in November 2001. A later plot to [[Paris embassy terrorist attack plot|bomb the U.S. embassy in Paris]] failed, as did an alleged plot to attack a target in [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Zubaydah was probably a conspirator in both of those plots.

[[Image:CommissionReportOnTravel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|References cited by the [[9/11 Commission]], showing that Zubaydah was often the bulk of references]]U.S. intelligence located Zubaydah in 2002 by tracing his phone calls. He was captured [[March 28]], [[2002]], in a two story apartment in [[Faisalabad]], Pakistan. He was shot three times in a firefight, including a wound to the groin and a wound to the thigh, but survived. While in U.S. custody, he has given a great deal of information about the 9/11 attack plot, detail that led to the indictments of over one hundred people, including [[Mohamed Harkat]].  Critics however have claimed that several of the interrogations may have bordered on torture to pressure Zubaydah into fingering other suspects. 

Zubaida is held within the [[CIA prison system]], where many have claimed that he is possibly subjected to torture.  His statements under interrogation have provided a very large amount of the information used around the world as 'definitive', and he is the sole person to make many of the claims.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arithmetic''' or '''arithmetics''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''ἀριθμός'' = number) in common usage is a branch of (or the forerunner of) [[mathematics]] which records elementary properties of certain ''operations'' on [[numeral]]s, though professional [[mathematician]]s often treat ''arithmetic'' as a synonym for [[number theory]].  It is the oldest and simplest branch of mathematics, used widely by almost everyone from simple daily counting to more advanced [[science]] and [[business]].

== Arithmetic operations ==
The traditional arithmetic operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]], although more advanced operations (such as manipulations of [[percentage]]s, [[square root]], [[exponentiation]], and [[logarithm|logarithmic functions]]) are also sometimes included in this subject.  Arithmetic is performed according to an [[order of operations]].

== Number theory ==
The term ''arithmetic'' is also used to refer to [[number theory]]. This includes the properties of integers related to [[prime number|primality]], [[divisibility]], and the [[Diophantine equations|solution of equations by integers]], as well as modern research which is an outgrowth of this study. It is in this context that one runs across the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] and [[arithmetic function]]s. ''A Course in Arithmetic'' by [[Serre]] reflects this usage, as do such phrases as ''first order arithmetic'' or ''arithmetical algebraic geometry''.

==Arithmetic in education==
[[Primary education]] in mathematics often places a strong focus on arithmetic, as further studies in mathematics as well as [[science]] benefit from an understanding of arithmetic.  There are exceptions, such as [[New Math]], which taught arithemtic indirectly using [[set theory]].

The arithmetic of [[natural number]]s, [[integer]]s, [[rational number]]s (in the form of [[vulgar fraction]]s), and [[real number]]s (using the [[decimal]] place-value system known as [[algorism]]) is typically studied by schoolchildren, who learn manual [[algorithm]]s for arithmetic.  However, in adult life, many people prefer to use tools such as [[calculator]]s, [[computer]]s, or the [[abacus]] to perform the more complex arithmetical computations.

'''Alternative dispute resolution''' or '''ADR''' is a name for several [[dispute resolution]] processes and techniques which, while believed by some to be outside the traditional mainstream of state [[jurisprudence]], have gained acceptance among both the general public and the [[legal]] [[profession]].  In this terminology the processes were initially termed &quot;alternative&quot; by [[20th century]] legal typologists because they were seen as extra-legal supplements to state-sponsored dispute resolution.  With the continuing increase in caseload placing great strain on traditional courts, many judges have come to see dispute resolution as an acceptable means of decreasing caseload in traditional courts, while settling disputes in a fair and equitable way. While some would not agree that all alternative methods are always fair and equitable, such methods are much less expensive than a traditional lawsuit.

[[Arbitration]] was actually one of the earliest forms of dispute resolution. It was practiced by the jurisconsults of the [[Roman Empire]], and predates the [[adversarial system]] of [[common law]] by at over a thousand years. Many people have played the role of [[Mediation|mediator]], [[Conciliation|conciliator]] or [[Arbitration#Arbitrators|arbitrator]] in many jurisdictions at many times. The [[Vodun]] [[priest]]s of [[Haiti]] are well known for their dispute resolution role which occasionally resulted in the losing party being forced to become a [[zombie]].  The [[King of France]] refused [[lawyers]] permission to practice in [[New France]], so [[Catholicism|Catholic]] priests and [[civil law notary|civil law notaries]] were used by the local populace as dispute resolution resources.

ADR is generally classified into at least three subtypes: [[negotiation]], [[mediation]], and [[arbitration]]. (Sometimes a fourth type, [[conciliation]], is included as well, but for present purposes it can be regarded as a form of mediation. The salient features of each type are as follows:

*In negotiation, participation is  voluntary and there is no third party who either facilitates the resolution process or imposes a resolution.
*In mediation, participation is voluntary (in that even though a court may mandate the process itself, the parties are not required to reach a resolution), and there is a [[third party]], a mediator, who facilitates the resolution process but does ''not'' impose a resolution on the parties.
*In arbitration, participation is ordinarily voluntary, and there is a third party who ''both'' facilitates the resolution process ''and'' imposes a resolution.

To what is &quot;alternative&quot; dispute resolution an alternative? Usually, to [[litigation]] -- but more generally, it is also an &quot;alternative&quot; both to allowing a dispute to drop and to resorting to [[violence]].  Lawyers have humorous jokes about ADR which use the term as a synonym for any form of violent, extralegal dispute resolution (e.g., my ADR is a two-by-four).  

ADR can increasingly be conducted online or by using technology. This branch of dispute resolution is known as [[Online Dispute Resolution]] or ODR. It should be noted, however, that ODR services can be provided by government entities, and as such may form part of the litigation process. Moreover, they can be provided on a global scale, where no effective domestic remedies are available to disputing parties, as in the case of the [[UDRP]] and [[domain name]] disputes. In this respect, ODR might not satisfy the &quot;alternative&quot; element of ADR.

'''Andersonville''' is a city located in [[Sumter County, Georgia]].  As of the [[2000]] census, the city had a total population of 331 (174 in [[1910]]).  It is in the southwest part of the state, about 60 miles southwest of [[Macon, Georgia]] on the [[Central of Georgia]] [[railroad]].  During the [[American Civil War]], it was the site of a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] which is now [[Andersonville National Historic Site]].

== Geography ==
Andersonville is located at 32&amp;deg;11'49&quot; North, 84&amp;deg;8'30&quot; West (32.197008, -84.141701){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 3.4 [[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]] (1.3 [[square mile|mi&amp;sup2;]]).  3.4 km&amp;sup2; (1.3 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is land and none of the area is covered with water.

== History ==
Andersonville, originally named Anderson, Georgia, was given the name Andersonville by the United States Postal Service to prevent confusion with another city, also named Anderson.  The town, though unimpressive, and very sparsely populated, was in existence before the establishment of the Confederate prison camp at the site.  Andersonville is infamous as a [[Confederate]] [[American Civil War|civil war]] [[Prisoner-of-war_camp|POW camp]]. A small base known as Civil War village was established for visitors and Confederate soldiers. This former stockade has since become a small town. After the civil war the Andersonvillle POW camp evolved into a small town with its own hotel, post office and restaurant. Later the [[Andersonville National Historic Site]] was established as a memorial to the POWs who died at the camp. There is also a small museum to display how the town was founded and the involvment with the site of the Andersonville POW camp.
[[Image:Andersonville,ga.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A small village (next door to Andersonville National Historic Site) is known as 'Civil  War village' where tourists came to see around the town.]]

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of [[2000]], there are 331 people, 124 households, and 86 families residing in the city.  The [[population density]] is 98.3/km&amp;sup2; (254.1/mi&amp;sup2;).  There are 142 housing units at an average density of 42.2/km&amp;sup2; (109.0/mi&amp;sup2;).  The racial makeup of the city is 65.26% White and 34.74% [[African American]].  1.21% of the population are [[Hispanic American|Hispanic]] or [[Race (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.

There are 124 households out of which 34.7% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.0% are [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 17.7% have a female householder with no husband present, and 30.6% are non-families. 26.6% of all households are made up of individuals and 10.5% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older.  The average household size is 2.67 and the average family size is 3.21.

In the city the population is spread out with 27.8% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 31.4% from 25 to 44, 19.3% from 45 to 64, and 12.1% who are 65 years of age or older.  The median age is 36 years.  For every 100 females there are 105.6 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 97.5 males.

The median income for a household in the city is $29,107, and the median income for a family is $30,972. Males have a median income of $26,591 versus $20,000 for females.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Agra canal''' is an important [[India]]n [[irrigation]] work, available 
also for navigation, in [[Delhi]], [[Gurgaon]], [[Muttra]] and [[Agra District|Agra]] districts, and [[Bharatpur]] State. It was opened in [[1874]].

The [[canal]] receives its water from the [[Jumna River]] at [[Okia]], about ten miles below Delhi.  The weir across the Jumna was the first attempted in [[Upper India]] upon a foundation of fine sand; it is about 800-yard long, and rises seven-feet above the summer level of the river.

From Okla the canal follows the high land between the Khari-nadi and the Jumna, and finally joins the Banganga river about 20 miles below Agra. Navigable branches connect the canal with Muttra and Agra.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amakusa''' (&amp;#22825;&amp;#33609;) is an island belonging to [[Japan]], 26&amp;frac12; miles long and 13&amp;frac12; in extreme width, situated about 32°20'N, 130°E, on the west of [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] (formerly the province of [[Higo province|Higo]] on the island of [[Kyushu]]), from which it is separated by the [[Yatsushiro-kai]].

It has no high mountains, but its surface being very hilly -- four of the peaks rise to a height over 1500 feet -- the natives resort to the terrace system of [[cultivation]] with remarkable success.  

A number of the heads of the Christians executed in connection with the [[Shimabara rebellion]] in the first half of the [[17th century]] were buried in this island.  Amakusa produces a little [[coal]] and fine [[kaolin]], which was largely used in former times by the potters of [[Hirado]] and [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]]. 

Now '''[[Amakusa District, Kumamoto]]''' is a [[district (japan)|district]] and '''[[Amakusa, Kumamoto]]''' is a [[town (japan)|town]] in [[Kumamoto prefecture|Kumamoto]].

[[image:Afterglow.jpg|thumb|200px|left|An afterglow in [[Slovenia]]n mountains, near [[Triglav Lakes Valley]].]]

The '''afterglow''' is the broad high arch of whitish or rosy light, appearing occasionally in the [[sky]], above the highest [[cloud]]s in the hour of deepening [[twilight]], or [[reflection (optics)|reflected]] from the high [[snow]]fields in [[mountain]] regions long after [[sunset]].

The phenomenon is due to very fine particles of [[dust]] suspended in the high regions of the [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that produce a scattering effect upon the component parts of [[white]] [[light]].  After the eruption of [[Krakatoa]] in [[1883]], a remarkable series of [[red]] sunsets appeared all over the world.  These were due to an enormous amount of exceedingly fine dust blown to a great height by that terrific explosion, and then universally diffused by the high [[atmospheric current]]s. This was shown in Edvard Munch's 'The Scream'.

He was formerly identified with an [[Egypt]]ian priest who, after the destruction of the pagan temple at [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]] ([[389]]), fled to [[Constantinople]], where he became the tutor of the ecclesiastical historian [[Socrates Scholasticus|Socrates]].  But it seems more probable 
that the real author was [[Herennius Philo]] of Byblus, who was born during the reign of [[Nero]] and lived till the reign of [[Hadrian]], and that the treatise in its present form is a revision prepared by a later Byzantine editor, whose name may have been Ammonius.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[abstract algebra]], an '''algebraic closure''' of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is an [[algebraic extension]] of ''K'' that is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]].  It is one of many [[closure (mathematics)|closures]] in mathematics.

Using [[Zorn's lemma]], it can be shown that every field has an algebraic closure, and that the algebraic closure of a field ''K'' is unique [[up to]] an [[isomorphism]] that [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixes]] every member of ''K''. Because of this essential uniqueness, we often speak of ''the'' algebraic closure of ''K'', rather than ''an'' algebraic closure of ''K''.

The algebraic closure of a field ''K'' can be thought of as the largest algebraic extension of ''K''.
To see this, note that if ''L'' is any algebraic extension of ''K'', then the algebraic closure of ''L'' is also an algebraic closure of ''K'', and so ''L'' is contained within the algebraic closure of ''K''.
The algebraic closure of ''K'' is also the smallest algebraically closed field containing ''K'',
because if ''M'' is any algebraically closed field containing ''K'', then the elements of ''M'' which are algebraic over ''K'' form an algebraic closure of ''K''.

The algebraic closure of a field ''K'' has the same [[cardinal number|cardinality]] as ''K'' if ''K'' is infinite, and is [[countably infinite]] if ''K'' is finite.

==Examples==

*The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] states that the algebraic closure of the field of [[real number|real numbers]] is the field of [[complex number|complex numbers]].

*The algebraic closure of the field of [[rational number|rational numbers]] is the field of [[algebraic number|algebraic numbers]].

*There are many countable algebraically closed fields within the complex numbers, and strictly containing the field of algebraic numbers; these are the algebraic closures of transcendental extensions of the rational numbers, e.g. the algebraic closure of '''Q'''(&amp;pi;).

*For a [[finite field]] of [[prime number|prime]] order ''p'', the algebraic closure is a [[countably infinite]] field which contains a copy of the field of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for each positive [[integer]] ''n'' (and is in fact the union of these copies).

*See also [[Puiseux expansion]].

==Separable closure==

An algebraic closure of ''K'' contains a subfield ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;, which contains all the finite [[separable extension]]s of ''K'' within it. For ''K'' a [[perfect field]], the algebraic and separable closures are the same. In other cases the separable closure must be used to define the [[absolute Galois group]] of ''K''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Adolphe sax statue.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Life-size statue of Adolphe Sax outside his birthplace in [[Dinant]], [[Belgium]].]]
'''Antoine-Joseph''' (known as '''Adolphe''') '''Sax''' ([[November 6]], [[1814]] &amp;ndash; [[February 4]], [[1894]]) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[musical instrument]] designer, best known for inventing the [[saxophone]].

Adolphe Sax was born in [[Dinant]] in [[Wallonia]], Belgium. His father, [[Charles-Joseph Sax]], was an instrument designer himself, who made several changes to the design of the [[horn (instrument)|horn]]. Adolphe began to make his own instruments at an early age, entering two of his [[flute]]s and a [[clarinet]] into a competition at the age of fifteen. He subsequently studied those two instruments at the Royal School of Singing in [[Brussels]].

Having left the school, Sax began to experiment with new instrument designs, while his father continued to produce conventional instruments to bring money into the household. Adolphe's first important invention was an improvement of the [[bass clarinet]] design which he patented at the age of 20.

In [[1841]], Sax relocated permanently to [[Paris]] and began work on a new set of instruments which were exhibited there in [[1844]]. They were keyed [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]]s, and although he had not invented the instrument itself, his examples were so superior to those of his rivals that they became known as [[saxhorn|saxhorns]]. They range in approximately 7 different sizes, looking somewhat similar to the euphonium and also paved the path to the creation of the flugelhorn. Today, they are widely used in military bands and sometimes in orchestras.  The saxhorn also laid the groundwork for the modern [[euphonium]]. He also developed the [[saxtromba]] in [[1845]], though this survived only briefly.

The 1840s also saw Sax inventing the instrument for which he is now best known, the [[saxophone]], though is new invention was actually patented in 1838. The saxophone was invented for use in military bands. However, because of the raspy sound that is made synonomous with the saxophone as compared to the traditional brass and reed-absent instruments in traditional miitary bands, the saxophone is not used in military bands very often anymore. The instrument is made of brass with a conical bore and a flared &quot;bell&quot; like other brass made instruments. It is part of the woodwind family and uses a single reed and mouthpiece much like the clarinet. The [[composer]] [[Hector Berlioz]] wrote approvingly of the new instrument in [[1842]], but the instrument was not patented until [[1846]], after he had designed and exhibited a full range of saxophones (from soprano to bass). These instruments made his reputation, and secured him a job teaching at the [[Paris Conservatoire]] from [[1867]].

Sax continued to make instruments later in life, as well as presiding over a new saxophone class at the Paris Conservatoire. However, rival instrument-makers attacked the legitimacy of his patents and mounted a lengthy campaign of litigation against Sax and his company, driving him into bankruptcy twice (in [[1856]] and [[1873]]). The prolonged legal struggle may also have undermined his own health; he suffered from lip cancer between [[1853]] and [[1858]] but made a full recovery. 

He died in [[1894]] in Paris and was interred in the [[Cimetière de Montmartre]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[phonetics]], '''aspiration''' is the strong burst of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] that accompanies the release of some [[obstruent]]s. To feel or see the difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds, one can put a hand or a lit candle in front of his or her mouth, and say ''tore'' and then ''store''. One should either feel a puff of air or see a flicker of the candle flame with ''tore'' that one does not get with ''store''. In English, the ''t'' should be aspirated in ''tore'' and unaspirated in ''store''.

The diacritic for aspiration in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is a superscript &quot;h&quot;, {{IPA|[ʰ]}}. Unaspirated consonants are not normally marked explicitly, but there is a diacritic for non-aspiration in the [[International_Phonetic_Alphabet#Extended_IPA_diacritics|Extended IPA]], the superscript equal sign, {{IPA|[⁼]}}. 

[[Voiceless]] consonants are produced with the [[vocal cords]] open. (Voicing involves bringing the vocal cords close together.) Voiceless aspiration occurs when the vocal cords remain open after a consonant is released. An easy way to measure this is by noting the consonant's [[voice onset time]], as the voicing of a following vowel cannot begin until the vocal cords close. However, aspirated consonants are not always followed by vowels or other voiced sounds; indeed, in Eastern [[Armenian language|Armenian]], aspiration is contrastive even at the ends of words:

[[English language|English]] [[voiceless]] [[stop consonant]]s are aspirated when they are word-initial or begin a [[stressed syllable]], as in ''pen'', ''ten'', ''Ken'', but this is not distinctive. That is, these consonants have unaspirated variants in other positions, such as word-finally or in an initial cluster with [s], as in ''spun'', ''stun'', ''skunk''. In many languages, such as [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], [[Hindi]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]], [[Thai language|Thai]], and [[Ancient Greek]], {{IPA|[p⁼ t⁼ k⁼]}} ''etc.'' and {{IPA|[pʰ tʰ kʰ]}} ''etc.'' are different [[phoneme]]s altogether.

[[Alemannic German|Alemannic German dialects]] have unaspirated {{IPA|[p⁼ t⁼ k⁼]}} as well as aspirated {{IPA|[pʰ tʰ kʰ]}}; the latter series are usually viewed as [[consonant cluster]]s. In [[Danish language|Danish]] and most southern varieties of [[German language|German]], the &quot;[[Fortis and lenis|lenis]]&quot; consonants transcribed for historical reasons as {{IPA|&amp;lt;b d g&amp;gt;}} are distinguished them from their &quot;[[Fortis and lenis|fortis]]&quot; counterparts {{IPA|&amp;lt;p t k&amp;gt;}} mainly in their lack of aspiration.

[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] has '''pre-aspirated''' {{IPA|[ʰp ʰt ʰk]}}; some scholars interpret these as consonant clusters as well. 

There are degrees of aspiration. Armenian and Cantonese have aspiration that lasts about as long as English aspirated stops, as well as unaspirated stops like Spanish. Korean has lightly aspirated stops that fall between the Armenian and Cantonese unaspirated and aspirated stops, as well as strongly aspirated stops whose aspiration lasts longer than that of Armenian or Cantonese. (See [[voice onset time]].) An old IPA symbol for light aspiration was {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʻ&amp;nbsp;]}} (that is, like a rotated ejective symbol), but this is no longer commonly used. There is no specific symbol for strong aspiration, but {{IPA|[ʰ]}} can be iconically doubled for, say, Korean *{{IPA|[kʻ&amp;nbsp;]}} vs. *{{IPA|[kʰʰ]}}. Note however that Korean is nearly universally transcribed as {{IPA|[k]}} vs. {{IPA|[kʰ]}}, with the details of voice onset time given numerically. 

Aspiration also varies with [[place of articulation]]. Spanish /p t k/, for example, have voice onset times (VOTs) of about 5, 10, and 30 milliseconds, whereas English /p t k/ have VOTs of about 60, 70, and 80 ms. Korean has been measured at 20, 25, and 50 ms for /p t k/ and 90, 95, and 125 for {{IPA|/pʰ tʰ kʰ/}}. 

The word 'aspiration' and the aspiration symbol is sometimes used with voiced stops, such as {{IPA|[dʰ]}}. However, such &quot;voiced aspiration&quot;, also known as [[breathy voice|''breathy voice'' or ''murmur'']], is less ambiguously transcribed with dedicated diacritics, either {{IPA|[d̤]}} or {{IPA|[dʱ]}}. (Some linguists restrict the subscript diacritic {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;̤]}} to [[sonorant]]s, such as [[vowel]]s and [[nasal consonant]]s, which are murmured throughout their duration, and use the superscript {{IPA|[ʱ]}} for the murmured release of obstruents.) When it is included as aspiration, voiceless aspiration is called just that to avoid ambiguity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arteriovenous malformation''' or '''AVM''' is a [[congenital disorder]] of the veins and arteries that make up the [[blood vessels | vascular system ]] .  The cause of this disorder is unknown, but is not generally thought to be [[hereditary]], unless in the context of a specific hereditary syndrome.

Arteries and veins are part of the [[ Circulatory system | human cardiovascular system]]. Normally, the arteries in the vascular system carry oxygen-rich blood at a relatively high pressure.  Structurally, arteries divide and sub-divide repeatedly, eventually forming a sponge-like capillary bed.  Blood moves through the capillaries, giving up oxygen and taking up waste products from the surrounding cells. Capillaries successively join together, one upon the other, to form the veins that carry blood away at a relatively low pressure.  The heart acts to pump blood from the low pressure veins to the high pressure arteries.

If the capillary bed is thought of as a sponge, then an AVM is the rough equivalent of jamming a tangle of flexible soda straws from artery to vein through that sponge.  On arteriorgram films AVM formation often resemble a tangle of spaghetti noodles. This tangle of blood vessels forms a relatively direct connection between high pressure arteries and low pressure veins. 

The result is a collection of blood vessels with abnormal connections and without [[capillaries]]. This collection, often called a &lt;I&gt;nidus&lt;/I&gt;, can be extremely fragile and prone to bleeding. AVMs can occur in various parts of the body including the [[human brain|brain]] (see [[cerebral arteriovenous malformation]]), [[spleen]], [[lung]], [[kidney]] and [[liver]]. AVMs may occur in isolation or as a part of another disease (e.g. [[von Hippel-Lindau disease]] or [[Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome]]).

This bleeding can be devasting, particularly in the brain. They can cause severe and often fatal [[stroke]]s.  If detected before the stroke occurs, usually the arteries feeding blood into the nidus can be closed off, ensuring the safety of the patient.

This condition affected the character of Nate in the US TV series [[Six Feet Under]].

'''Atlanta''' is the capital of and largest city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], although a portion of the city (the 1909 [[annex]]) is located in [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]]. According to the latest [[U.S. Census|census]] estimates (as of December, 2004), the city has a [[Population of Atlanta|population]] of 425,000 and the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] totaled 4,708,297, making it the ninth-largest metropolitan area in the [[United States]] and the 41st-largest city proper. Atlanta is arguably a poster-child for cities worldwide experiencing rapid urban [[sprawl]], population growth, and commercial development. As a result, Atlanta is a common case study for college students who study Urban Geography around the globe.

The Atlanta area was originally inhabited by Cherokee and Creek Indians, and was named Standing Peachtree.  In 1823, the area was opened to white settlement.  It remained mostly woods until 1836, when the area was chosen as the southern &quot;Terminus&quot; of a railroad from Chattanooga. A local settlement called &quot;[[John Thrasher#Founding of Atlanta|Thrasherville]]&quot; (near present-day Philips arena, home of the Atlanta Thrashers) was renamed &quot;Terminus,&quot; and in 1843 the town was officially named &quot;Marthasville,&quot; after the daughter of the governor of Georgia.  The business community, however, was concerned that such a name wouldn't sell, and a new name, &quot;Atlanta,&quot; was chosen in 1845 as much more marketable.  Hence, from the start &quot;Atlanta&quot; began as a transportation hub and marketing center.  The town was incorporated as the &quot;city&quot; of Atlanta in 1847, and by 1860 the population was 9,554.

Atlanta was largely destroyed by Union forces during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but was chosen as the state capital in 1868, having been established as the site of command for Union soldiers and the Reconstruction administration. In the 1880's, a revival was led by newspaperman Henry Grady, who advocated Atlanta as the &quot;capital of the New South.&quot; By 1890 Atlanta had 65,000 residents and was one of the 50 largest cities in America, a distinction Atlanta has held for over 110 years. In 1892, Atlanta's first skyscraper, the 8-story Equitable Building, began Atlanta's rise to the skies. The city expanded rapidly from 1900 (89,000) to 1930 (302,000) before growth slowed during the Depression. In the 1960's Atlanta was a center for the [[American Civil Rights Movement]]. In 1970, the city's population topped out at 497,000 before &quot;white flight&quot; to the suburbs dropped the city to 394,000 in 1990. However, in 1996 Atlanta served as the host city for the Centennial [[1996 Summer Olympics]], and the city has rallied to 425,000 by 2004, fueled in part by a new desire for shorter commutes and intown living.

One of the city's nicknames, &quot;The Phoenix City&quot;, relates to its rise after the Civil War.  The [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] appears in many of Atlanta's  symbols, including its seal and flag. In the 1940s and 1950s, former Atlanta mayor [[William B. Hartsfield]] called Atlanta &quot;The City Too Busy to Hate&quot;.  In addition, it has also been called the &quot;New York of the South&quot; in response to one of Georgia's own nicknames, &quot;The Empire State of the South.&quot; Atlanta may also be known as '''ATL''', a [[colloquialism]] for the city derived from the [[IATA airport code]] for the airport.

Atlanta is circled by [[Interstate 285]], called the &quot;Perimeter&quot; by locals, which has come to delineate the interior of the city from the surrounding suburbs. This has given rise to the terms ITP (inside the Perimeter) and OTP (outside the Perimeter) to describe area neighborhoods, residents, and businesses.  In this respect, the Perimeter plays a social and geographical role similar to that of the [[Capital Beltway]] around [[Washington, DC]]. 

Atlanta has such a great economic impact on the state and the surrounding region that cities and towns up to 100 miles away are considered 'exurbs', defined by the fact that people depend on their livelihoods by commuting to work in the city, rapidly growing what is called [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Metro Atlanta]].  Atlanta is one of the most prosperous cities in the United States and is often referred to as the unofficial &quot;capital of the South.&quot; The city is also an especially important cultural and economic center for [[African-American|African-Americans]]; Atlanta has not had a non-black mayor for over 30 years, and in recent decades nearly all Fire Chiefs, Police Chiefs, and other government officials have been African-American.

==History== 
The region where Atlanta and its suburbs were built was originally [[Creek people|Creek]] and [[Cherokee]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] territory. The Creek land in the eastern part of the metro area (including Decatur) was opened to white settlement in 1823. In 1835, leaders of the Cherokee nation ceded their land to the government in exchange for land out west under the [[Treaty of New Echota]], an act that eventually led to the [[Trail of Tears]]. In 1836 the [[Georgia General Assembly]] voted to build the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]] to provide a trade route to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], with the area around Atlanta--then called [[Terminus]]--serving as the terminal. The terminus was originally planned for [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]], but its citizens did not want it. Besides Decatur, several other suburbs of Atlanta predate the city by several years, including [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]] and [[Lawrenceville, Georgia|Lawrenceville, GA]]. Terminus grew as a railroad town; later it was renamed [[Marthasville, Georgia|Marthasville]] after then-Governor Wilson Lumpkin's daughter Martha. Marthasville was renamed Atlanta in 1845 and was incorporated as such in 1847.
[[Image:Atlanta1864.jpg|thumbnail|left|A slave auction house on Whitehall St., before Sherman burned Atlanta]]

In 1864, the city became the target of a major Union invasion (the subject of the 1939 film [[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]). The area now covered by Atlanta was the scene of several battles, including the [[Battle of Peachtree Creek]], the [[Battle of Atlanta]], and the [[Battle of Ezra Church]]. On [[September 1]] [[1864]], [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[John Bell Hood]] evacuated Atlanta after a four-month siege mounted by Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William Sherman]] and ordered all public buildings and possible union assets destroyed. The next day, mayor [[James Calhoun]] surrendered the city, and on [[September 7]] Sherman ordered the civilian population to evacuate. He then ordered Atlanta burned to the ground on [[November 11]] in preparation for his punitive march south. After a plea by Father Thomas O'Reilly of Immaculate Conception Catholic Church, Sherman did not burn the city's churches or hospitals. The remaining war resources were then destroyed in the aftermath and in [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]. The fall of Atlanta was a critical point in the Civil War, giving the North more confidence, and leading to the re-election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the eventual surrender of the Confederacy.

After the war, Atlanta was gradually rebuilt and soon became the industrial and commercial center of the South. From 1867 until 1888, US Army soldiers occupied McPherson Barracks (later renamed [[Fort McPherson]]) in southwest Atlanta to ensure [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] reforms. To help the newly freed slaves, the federal government set up a [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands|Freedmen's Bureau]], which helped establish what is now [[Clark Atlanta University]], one of several historically black colleges in Atlanta. In 1868, Atlanta became the fifth city to serve as the state capital. [[Henry W. Grady]], the editor of the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'', promoted the city to investors as a city of the &quot;New South,&quot; by which he meant a diversification of the economy away from agriculture and a shift from the &quot;Old South&quot; attitudes of slavery and rebellion.

[[Image:Peachtree1907.jpg|thumbnail|In 1907, Peachtree Street, the main street of Atlanta, was busy with streetcars and automobiles.]]
As Atlanta grew, ethnic and racial tensions mounted. A [[race riot]] in 1906 left at least twelve dead and over seventy injured. In 1913, [[Leo Frank]], a Jewish supervisor at an Atlanta factory, was put on trial for raping and murdering a thirteen-year old white employee. After doubts about Frank's guilt led his death sentence to be commuted in 1915, riots broke out in Atlanta and Frank was [[lynching|lynched]].

In the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] hit Atlanta. With the city government nearing bankruptcy, the [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola Company]] had to help bail out the city's deficit. The federal government stepped in to help Atlantans by establishing [[Techwood Homes]], the nation's first federal [[public housing|housing project]] in 1935. With the entry of the United States into [[World War II]], soldiers from around the southeast went through Atlanta to train and later be discharged at Fort McPherson. War-related manufacturing such as the [[Bell Aircraft]] factory in the suburb of [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]] helped boost the city's population and economy. Shortly after the war in 1946, the Communicable Disease Center, later called the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] was founded in Atlanta from the old Malaria Control in War Areas offices and staff.

In 1951, the city received the [[All-America City Award]], due to its rapid growth and high standard of living in the southern U.S.

In the 1960s, Atlanta was a major organizing center of the [[American civil rights movement|civil rights movement]], with [[Martin Luther King|Dr. Martin Luther King]] and students from Atlanta's historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movement's leadership. On October 19, 1960, a sit-in at the lunch counters of several Atlanta department stores led to the arrest of Dr. King and several students, drawing attention from the national media and from presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]]. Despite this incident, Atlanta's political and business leaders fostered Atlanta's image as &quot;the city too busy to hate&quot;. In 1961, Mayor Ivan Allen Jr became one of the few Southern white mayors to support desegregation of Atlanta's public schools. While the city mostly avoided confrontation, small race riots did occur in 1965 and in 1968. In 1990, the [[International Olympic Committee]] selected Atlanta as the site for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. Following the announcement, Atlanta undertook several major construction projects to improve the city's parks, sports facilities, and transportation. Former Mayor [[Bill Campbell]] allowed many &quot;tent cities&quot; to be built creating a carnival atmosphere around the games. Atlanta became the first [[United States|American]] capital city to host the Olympics. The games themselves were a wonderful achievement in sports, but were marred by the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]], which resulted in the death of two people and injured several others. The bombing was carried out by [[Eric Robert Rudolph]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Midtown Atlanta.JPG|thumb|Midtown Atlanta's skyline]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 343.0 km² (132.4 mi²). 341.2 km² (131.8 mi²) of it is land and 1.8 km² (0.7 mi²) of it is water. The total area is 0.51% water.

At about 1000 feet or 300 meters above mean sea level, Atlanta sits atop a ridge south of the [[Chattahoochee River]]. Amongst the 25 largest [[United States metropolitan area|MSA]]s, Atlanta is the third-highest in elevation, slightly lower than [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and 1 mile (1,600 m) high [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]].

According to folklore, its central avenue, [[Peachtree Street]], runs through the center of the city on the [[Eastern Continental Divide]]. In actuality, the divide line enters Atlanta from the southwest, proceeding to downtown. From downtown, the divide line runs eastward along DeKalb Avenue and the [[CSX]] rail lines through Decatur. Rainwater that falls on the south and east side runs eventually into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] while rainwater on the north and west side of the divide runs into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

The latter is via the [[Chattahoochee River]], part of the [[ACF River Basin]], and from which Atlanta and many of its neighbors draw most of their water. Being at the far northwestern edge of the city, much of the river's natural habitat is still preserved, in part by the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area. Downstream however, excessive water use during droughts and pollution during floods has been a source of contention and legal battles with neighboring states [[Alabama]] and [[Florida]].

==Climate==
[[Image:AtlantaSnow.jpg|thumb|200px|A wintry snow landscape in midtown Atlanta, January 2003.]]
Due to the several reasons Atlanta experiences a cooler climate than most cities in the southern U.S. Among these are: distance from the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico with their moderating effect, elevation, prevailing wind patterns, and an extensive tree cover that mitigates the [[urban heat island]]. This contrast seems especially pronounced in comparison with the subtropical areas of coastal [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. In fact, contrary to the perception of many visitors, the oft-heard nickname &quot;Hotlanta&quot; is a reflection primarily of the area's prosperity dominant status within the South, rather than of high temperatures.

At 33°39' north, Atlanta lies at approximately the same latitude as such cities as [[Los Angeles]], [[Dallas]], [[Casablanca]], and [[Beirut]], but it experiences colder winter temperatures than all of these, with frost being recorded 48 times in an average year. The cold fronts that sweep south from Canada through the U.S. Midwest bring cold spells, severe enough to drop the temperature below -10°C (14°F) and even lower a few times a year.  The record low temperature in the city being a frigid -22°C (-9°F) dating to Feb. 13 1899, which was nearly tied on Jan. 21, 1985, when -21°C (-8°F) was recorded. Snowfall is variable, averaging some 5 centimeters (2 inches) per year, but every year sees at least some accumulation. It occurs as moisture from the Gulf of Mexico hits a strong cold front from the north. 

Though summers are quite humid, actual temperatures are only moderately hot, with afternoon high temperatures most often around 30°C (86°F). Only very rarely does the thermometer hit the oppressive mark of 38°C (100°F), this occurring in the past 30 years in 1980, 1983, 1986, 1993, 1995, and 2000, with the all-time record high of 41°C (105°F) being reached on July 13 and 17, 1980. 

Like the rest of the southeastern U.S., Atlanta enjoys abundant rainfall, which is evenly distributed throughout the year. The area receives some 127 centimeters (50.5 inches) of rain annually, which is surpassed only by [[Miami]] and [[New Orleans]] among major U.S. cities.

===Crime===
&lt;!--See talk page before re-adding 'Crime Index' or Olympics commentary--&gt;For several decades, Atlanta had been among the most violent cities in North America but in recent years the city has reduced violent crime considerably. While still high, the murder rate in 2004 was half that of [[New Orleans]].  In 2005, Atlanta recorded 93 homicides — the lowest total since 1963, and an almost 40% decrease from the 151 killings reported in 2002.

However, in 2005 Atlanta received embarrassing media attention for the high-profile [[Brian Nichols]] manhunt, who became internationally known as the &quot;Courthouse Killer&quot;. In addition, broadcast media focused attention on a standoff involving a murder suspect (not an Atlanta resident) who perched himself on top of a construction crane for several days in the upscale [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]] district.

===Attractions, events, and recreation===
[[Image:King_Tomb.gif|thumb|right|300px|The Sweet Auburn district is preserved as the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site.]]

[[Image:TheVarsity Atlanta-GA.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Varsity has been an Atlanta landmark for over 75 years.]]

[[Image:Piedmont Park, Atlanta, GA, USA field.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Atlanta's Piedmont Park is the city's largest park.]]

Atlanta boasts a variety of museums on subjects ranging from history to fine arts, natural history, and beverages. Prominent among them are sites honoring Atlanta's participation in the civil rights movement. Reverend Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was born in the city, and his boyhood home on Auburn Avenue in the Sweet Auburn district is preserved as the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site]]. Meetings with other civil rights leaders, including Hosea Williams and current [[Congressman]] [[John Lewis (politician)|John Lewis]], often happened at Paschal's, a diner and motor inn which was a favorite for &quot;colored&quot; people, banned from &quot;white&quot; restaurants in an era of racial segregation and intolerance. King's final resting place is in the tomb at the center of the reflecting pool at the King Center.

Other history museums and attractions include the [[Atlanta History Center]]; the [[Atlanta Cyclorama|Atlanta Cyclorama and Civil War Museum]] (a huge painting and [[diorama]] in-the-round, with a rotating central audience platform, that depicts the [[Battle of Atlanta]] in the Civil War); the [[Carter Center|Carter Center and Presidential Library]]; and the [[Margaret Mitchell House and Museum]].

The arts are represented by several theaters and museums, including the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta)|Fox Theatre]]. The [[Woodruff Arts Center]] is home to the Alliance Theatre, Atlanta Symphony, [[High Museum of Art]], and Atlanta College of Art.  Museums geared specifically towards children include the [[Fernbank Science Center]] and Imagine It! Atlanta's Children's Museum. The High Museum of Art is the city's major fine/visual arts venue, with a significant permanent collection and an assortment of traveling exhibitions.  The [[Atlanta Opera]], which was founded in 1979 by members of two struggling local companies, is arguably the most important opera company in the southeastern United States and enjoys a growing audience and international reputation.

Atlanta features the world's largest aquarium, the [[Georgia Aquarium]], which officially opened to the public on November 23, 2005. The aquarium features over 100,000 specimens in tanks holding approximately eight million gallons of water. One unique museum is the [[World of Coca-Cola]] featuring the history of the world famous soft drink brand and its well-known advertising. Adjacent is [[Underground Atlanta]], a historic shopping and entertainment complex situated under the streets of downtown Atlanta. In addition the [[Atlantic Station]], a huge new urban renewal project on the northwestern edge of Midtown Atlanta, officially opened in October of 2005. While not a museum per se, [[The Varsity]] is the main branch of the long-lived fast food chain, featured as the world's largest drive-in restaurant.

The heart of the city's festivals is [[Piedmont Park]].  In 1887, a group of prominent Atlantans purchased 189 acres (0.76 km²) of farmland to build a horse racing track, later developed into the site of the Cotton States International Exposition of 1895. In 1904, the city council purchased the land for $99,000, and today it is the largest park in metro Atlanta, with more than 2.5 million visitors each year. The grounds were part of the [[Battle of Peachtree Creek]] &amp;ndash; a Confederate division occupied the northern edge on [[July 20]], [[1864]] as part of the outer defense line against Sherman's approach. Next to the park is the [[Atlanta Botanical Garden]]. [[Zoo Atlanta]], home to its own [[panda]] exhibit, is located in [[Grant Park (Atlanta)|Grant Park]].

Just east of the city, [[Stone Mountain]] is the largest piece of exposed [[granite]] in the world. On its face are giant carvings of [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Robert E. Lee]], and [[Thomas J. Jackson|Stonewall Jackson]]. It is also the site of impressive [[laser]] shows in the [[summer]]. A few miles west of Atlanta on [[I-20]] is the [[Six Flags Over Georgia|Six Flags Over Georgia Theme Park]], which opened near the city in 1967, and was the second [[theme park]] in the [[Six Flags chain]].

Popular annual cultural events include:
*[[Atlanta Dogwood Festival]], a Spring arts and crafts festival at Piedmont Park.
*[[Music Midtown]] - Three-day music festival in early summer. (Now on hiatus)
*Atlanta Gay Pride [http://www.atlantapride.org]

===Music===
[[Jermaine Dupri]]'s 2001 [[hip hop music|hip hop]] single &quot;Welcome to Atlanta&quot; declares Atlanta the &quot;new [[Motown]]&quot;, referencing the city of [[Detroit, Michigan]], which was known for its contributions to popular music. A significant number of Atlantans have become successful [[musician]]s, including artists such as [[OutKast]], [[Jerry Reed]], [[Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips]], [[Blaque]], [[Ludacris]], [[T.I.]], [[Young Jeezy]], [[Ying Yang Twins]], [[D4L]], [[Monica (singer)|Monica]], [[Youngbloodz]], and [[Lil Jon]]. Others, such as [[Bobby Brown]] and [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Brian Littrell]] of the [[Backstreet Boys]], have moved to the city and made it their home. Of the many modern day recording artist/groups to be originated in Atlanta, [[TLC]] still by records sold, holds the crown for the biggest present day act with record sales hovering around the 50 million mark. Atlanta has also produced rock and pop music singers, such as alternative metal band [[Sevendust]] and modern rock band [[Collective Soul]], and was a proving ground for Connecticut-born pop-rock-blues musician [[John Mayer (musician)|John Mayer]].

[[record producers|Record Producers]] [[Antonio Reid|L.A. Reid]] and [[Babyface]] founded [[LaFace Records]] in Atlanta in the late-1980s; the label has eventually become the home to multi-platinum selling artists such as [[Toni Braxton]], [[TLC]], [[OutKast]], [[Goodie Mob]], [[Usher Raymond|Usher]] and [[Ciara]], many of whom are Atlantans themselves. It is also the home of [[So So Def Records]], a label founded by Jermaine Dupri in the mid-1990s, that signed acts such as [[Da Brat]], [[Jagged Edge (band)|Jagged Edge]], [[Xscape]], [[Dem Franchise Boyz]], and [[Bow Wow]]. The success of LaFace and SoSo Def led to Atlanta as an established scene for record labels such as LaFace parent company [[Arista]] to set up satellite offices.

Atlanta's classical music scene includes well-renowned ensembles such as the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]], [[Atlanta Opera]], [[Atlanta Ballet]], period-instrument ensemble [[New Trinity Baroque]], [[Atlanta Boy Choir]], and many others. Classical musicians include renowned conductors such as late [[Robert Shaw]], Atlanta Symphony's [[Robert Spano]], New Trinity Baroque's [[Predrag Gosta]], and others.

Despite producing numerous famous musicians, however, Atlanta's live pop music scene has suffered in recent years. Due in part to harsher new laws dictating the closing times of bars and nightclubs, many small to medium sized venues have closed down. As a result, fewer and fewer touring acts are stopping by Atlanta, putting further financial strain on the remaining clubs and venues. In the early 1980s, Atlanta was the home of a thriving [[new wave music]] scene featuring such bands as The Brains and [[The Producers (band)|The Producers]], closely linked to the new wave scenes in [[Athens, Georgia]] and other college towns in the southeast.

[[Image:1996summerolympicslogo.jpg|thumb|left|100 px|Games of the XXVI Olympiad]]Atlanta has a rich sports history, including the second intercollegiate football game in the South, [[Auburn University]] vs. [[University of Georgia]] in 1892. This game is often considered the Oldest Rivalry in the South. Currently it hosts college football's annual Chick-fil-A Bowl and the [[Peachtree Road Race]], the world’s largest 10K race. Atlanta was the host city for the Centennial [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. [[Centennial Olympic Park]], built for 1996 Summer Olympics, sits adjacent to [[CNN Center]] and [[Philips Arena]]. It is now operated by the [[Georgia World Congress Center]] Authority.

The city is also host to [[U.S. cities with teams from four major sports|four different major league sports]]. The [[Atlanta Braves]] [[baseball]] team has been the [[Major League Baseball]] franchise of Atlanta since 1966; the franchise was previously known as the [[Boston Braves]] (1912-1952), and the Milwaukee Braves (1953-1965). The team was founded in 1871 in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] as a National Association club, making it the oldest continuously operating sports franchise in North American sports. The Braves won the [[World Series]] in 1995 and have had an unprecedented run of fourteen straight divisional championships since 1991. Before the Braves moved to Atlanta, the [[Atlanta Crackers]] were Atlanta's professional baseball team from 1901 until their last season in 1965. They won 17 league championships in the minor leagues. The [[Atlanta Black Crackers]] were Atlanta's [[Negro League]] team from around 1921 until 1949.

The [[Atlanta Falcons]] [[American football]] team plays at the [[Georgia Dome]]. They have been Atlanta's [[National Football League]] franchise since 1966. They have won the division title three times, and a conference championship once, only to go on to lose to the [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]]. Super Bowl XXVIII and XXXIV were held in the city.

The [[Atlanta Hawks]] [[basketball]] team has been the [[National Basketball Association]] franchise of Atlanta since 1969; the team was previously known as the Tri-Cities Blackhawks (1946-1951), [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] Hawks (1951-55), [[Saint Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] Hawks (1955-68). Their only NBA championship was in 1958, when they were the St. Louis Hawks.

From 1992 to 1996 Atlanta was home to the short-lived [[Atlanta Knights]], an [[International Hockey League]] team. Their inaugural season was excellent for a new team, and was only bested by their sophomore season in which they won the championship Turner Cup. In 1996 they moved to [[Quebec City, Quebec|Quebec City]] and became the [[Quebec Rafales]].

In 1999 the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] [[Ice hockey|hockey]] team became Atlanta's [[National Hockey League]] franchise. They replaced the [[Atlanta Flames]] which had departed for [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] in 1980, becoming the [[Calgary Flames]]. The Thrashers have yet to make it to the playoffs. Both the Thrashers and the Hawks play in [[Philips Arena]].

The [[Georgia Force]] has been Atlanta's team in the [[Arena Football League]] since the franchise relocated from [[Nashville]] in 2002. The 2005 National Conference champions currently play in [[Philips Arena]].

The final event of the [[PGA Tour]] season, [[THE TOUR Championship]], is played annually at East Lake Golf Club. This golf course is used because of its connection to the great amateur golfer [[Bobby Jones (golf)|Bobby Jones]], an Atlanta native.

From 2001 to 2003 Atlanta hosted the [[Atlanta Beat]] [[football (soccer)|soccer]] team of the defunct [[Women's United Soccer Association]]. They appeared in two of the three Founders Cup championships held, losing to the [[Bay Area CyberRays]] in 2001, and the [[Washington Freedom]] team in 2003.  Currently, Atlanta is the home of the [[Atlanta Silverbacks]] of the [[United Soccer Leagues]] First Division (Men) and W-League (Women)

The [[Atlanta Kookaburras]] are a successful [[Australian rules football]] club that compete in mens and women's divisions in the [[MAAFL]] and [[SEAFL]] and [[USAFL National Championships]]. 

Other nearby sports facilities include [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]], a 1.5 mile (2.4 km) NASCAR race track in [[Hampton, Georgia]].

Atlanta is home to the [[Chick-fil-A Bowl]] (formerly known as the Peach Bowl) which is played at the [[Georgia Dome]] and matches a [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] team against an [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] opponent, as well as the [[List of SEC Conference Champions|SEC Championship Game]] in football annually, as well as hosting the basketball and gymnastics championships on several occasions.

===Religion===
Being the unofficial capital of the 'bible belt', a geographic region considered among the most highly religious in western civilization,{{fact}} the Atlanta cityscape is teeming with a seemingly countless number of large denominational churches and other places of worship. A large majority of Atlantans profess to following a Protestant Christian faith, and many people point out that religion plays a reasonably important role in their weekly lives.{{fact}} As a result, the city could arguably have the distinction of being among the most religious major cities in the country.{{fact}} Furthermore, a large number of students in the Metro area's northern counties attend faith-based private schools at a rate unsurpassed by many other parts of the country.{{fact}} Out of 75 private schools listed in Fulton county, only 8 have no religious ties. {{fact}} 

As the see of the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Archdiocese of Atlanta]], Atlanta serves as the [[Provincial See]] for the Province of Atlanta. The city is also a major [[Southern Baptist]] center.

==Economy==
Despite romantic associations, Atlanta has always been more a commercial city than an [[ante-bellum]] monument. It is the major center of regional commerce, and boasts an especially strong convention and trade show business. According to the [[Global city|ranking of world cities]] undertaken by the ''Globalization and World Cities Study Group &amp; Network (GaWC)'' and based on the level of presence of global corporate service organisations, Atlanta is considered a &quot;[[Gamma World City]].&quot;

Several major national and international companies are headquartered in Atlanta or its nearby suburbs, including four Fortune 100 companies: [[The Coca-Cola Company]] (started in Atlanta), [[Home Depot]] (started in Atlanta), [[BellSouth]], and [[United Parcel Service]] in adjacent [[Sandy Springs, Georgia|Sandy Springs]]. Home Depot founder [[Bernie Marcus]] donated more than 200 million dollars to build the new [[Georgia Aquarium]]. [[Delta Air Lines]] is also headquartered in Atlanta and is a major employer. [[Newell Rubbermaid]] is one of the most recent companies to relocate its headquarters to the metro area (Sandy Springs).

Just west of Midtown, a former Atlantic Steel plant has been redeveloped as [[Atlantic Station]], a mixed-use urban renewal project combining housing, retail, and office space, and promoted as part of the solution to Atlanta's serious traffic and air quality problems. The metro area has one of America's longest average daily commutes, and is one of the most car-dependent cities on the planet due both to suburban sprawl and underfunded mass transit systems. It also has a reputation as being one of the most dangerous for pedestrians,{{fact}} as far back as 1949 when ''Gone with the Wind'' author [[Margaret Mitchell]] was struck by a speeding car and killed.

The city is a major [[cable TV|cable television]] programming source; [[CNN Center]], headquarters of the [[Cable News Network]], is in Atlanta where the network was founded by [[Ted Turner]], and [[The Weather Channel]] broadcasts from just outside of town. In addition to CNN, [[Time Warner]]'s other networks from Atlanta include [[Cartoon Network]]/[[Adult Swim]] and companion channel [[Boomerang]], [[Turner Network Television|TNT]], [[Turner South]], [[CNN International]], [[CNN en Español]], [[CNN Headline News]], [[CNN Airport Network]], and [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS]]. Atlanta's [[TBS Superstation|WTBS]] channel 17 (originally WTCG) was Turner's start in television in the 1970s; after he bought the struggling UHF TV station, he turned it into a &quot;Superstation&quot; broadcasting both locally and nationally on the emerging cable providers. Atlanta's [[WSB (AM)|WSB]] was the first [[AM radio]] station in the South.

==Infrastructure==
===Government===
[[Image:Atlanta City Hall from HABS.jpg|thumb|Atlanta City Hall]]
Atlanta is governed by an at-large elected [[mayor]] and a city council. The city council consists of representatives of twelve districts from the city as well as three at-large positions. The mayor may veto a bill passed by the council, but the council may override with a two-thirds majority. The current mayor of Atlanta is [[Shirley Franklin]].

Possibly owing to the city's [[African American]] majority, each mayor elected since 1973 has been black; the uninterrupted string of black mayors in excess of thirty years is a first for any metropolitan area in the country. [[Maynard Jackson]] was elected for two terms and then for another term in the early 1990s. His successors [[Andrew Young]] (and later, [[Bill Campbell (mayor)|Bill Campbell]]) owed their success in the mayoral election at least in part to Jackson's endorsement.
In [[July 2004]], Atlanta became the first city in the state to impose a sales tax of its own, bringing the total to 8% in both the Fulton and DeKalb parts of the city.  This passed in a referendum during the [[July 20]]th primary election with a 75% majority, after being allowed by the state legislature earlier in 2004. The sales tax helped to reduce a huge rate increase on water and sewer bills, necessary to pay three billion dollars in bonds to fix the city's aging (and in places decrepit) municipal water and sewer systems. [[Combined sewer overflows]] will also be eliminated, so that runoff water is separated, preventing diluted sewage from overflowing at [[sewage treatment plant]]s during heavy rains.

As the [[state capital]], Atlanta is also the site of most of Georgia's state government, including the [[Georgia State Capitol]] (topped with gold from [[Dahlonega, Georgia]]), the [[Georgia General Assembly|General Assembly]], and the residence of the [[Governor of Georgia]] in [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]]. It is also home to [[Georgia Public Broadcasting]] headquarters and [[Peachnet]], and is the county seat of Fulton County, with which it shares responsibility for the [[Atlanta-Fulton Public Library System]].

===Transportation===
[[Image:MARTA - N3 Station.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|MARTA provides public transportation in Atlanta.]]

Atlanta is served by [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] {{airport codes|ATL|KATL}}, the world's busiest airport by [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|passenger traffic]] and by [[World's busiest airports by traffic movements|aircraft traffic]], providing air service to and from many national and international destinations. It is situated 10 miles south of downtown, adjacent to the intersection of [[Interstate 85|I-85]] and [[Interstate 285|I-285]]. The MARTA rail system has a station within the airport terminal, and provides direct service to the business areas in downtown Atlanta, [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]] and [[Sandy Springs, Georgia|Sandy Springs]]. The major [[general aviation]] airports near the city proper are [[DeKalb-Peachtree Airport]] {{airport codes|PDK|KPDK}} and [[Atlanta/Fulton County Airport-Brown Field]] {{airport codes|FTY|KFTY}}. See [[List of airports in the Atlanta area]] for a more complete listing.

Three major [[interstate highways]] intersect the city; [[Interstate 20|I-20]] runs east-west, while [[Interstate 75|I-75]] runs NW to SE and I-85 runs NE to SW, and join together as the [[Downtown Connector]] through the center of the city. I-285 (also known as &quot;the Perimeter&quot;) encircles the city and some of its inner suburbs. I-75 just north of the Windy Hill Road interchange in Cobb County is one of the widest freeways (seventeen lanes) in the entire world. The intersection of I-85 and I-285 in [[Doraville, Georgia|Doraville]], locally referred to as [[Tom Moreland Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]], is one of the tallest in the eastern United States. Metropolitan Atlanta is crisscrossed by thirteen freeways (in addition to the aforementioned interstates, I-575, Georgia 400, Georgia 141, I-675, Georgia 316, I-985, Stone Mountain Freeway (US 78), and Langford Parkway (SR 166)). The [http://www.dot.state.ga.us/ Georgia Department of Transportation] operates [http://georgianavigator.com/ Georgia Navigator] to disseminate current traffic (travel times, camera images, accidents) and road (construction, flooding, ice, debris) conditions throughout the state.

[[MARTA]] is the [[public transit]] [[agency]] in the city, operating the [[metro|subway]] and [[bus]] system within Fulton and Dekalb Counties. Clayton County, Gwinnett County and Cobb County all operate separate, autonomous transit authorities, all consisting of a bus network, with no rail. However, many commuters in Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs use [[automobile]]s as their primary mode of transportation. This results in heavy [[traffic]] during rush hour and contributes to Atlanta's [[air pollution]] problems. In recent years, the Atlanta metro area has ranked at or near the top of the longest average commute time in the US.

Atlanta grew up as a railroad town and is still today a major rail junction, with several busy freight lines belonging to [[Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] intersecting below street level in the downtown area. Long distance passenger service is provided by [[Amtrak]]'s [[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent train]] which connects Atlanta with the cities of [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. The Amtrak station is situated at 1688 Peachtree St. N.W., several miles north of downtown and not well located for onward public transportation. An ambitious long-standing proposal would create a Multi-Modal Passenger Terminal in downtown adjacent to Philips Arena and the Five-Points MARTA station which would link MARTA bus and rail, intercity bus service, proposed commuter rail service to other Georgia cities, and Amtrak in a single facility.

[[Greyhound Lines]] provides intercity bus service between Atlanta and many locations throughout the United States and Canada. The Greyhound terminal is situated at 232 Forsyth Street, on the southern edge of the downtown area and directly beneath MARTA's Garnett rail station.

The proposed [[Beltline (Atlanta)|Beltline]] would create a greenway and public transit system in a circle around the city from a series of mostly abandoned rail lines. This rail [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] would also accommodate multi-use [[trails]] connecting a string of existing and new parks.  In addition, there is a proposed [[streetcar]] project that would create a streetcar line along Peachtree from downtown to Buckhead as well as possibly another East-West line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty''' ('''ANZUS''' or '''ANZUS Treaty''') is the [[military alliance]] which binds [[Australia]] and the [[United States]], and separately Australia and [[New Zealand]] to cooperate on [[Defense (military)|defense]] matters in the Pacific Ocean area, though today the treaty is understood to relate to attacks in any area.
{{wikisource|Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty}}

==Treaty structure==
The treaty was previously a full three-way defence pact, but following a dispute between New Zealand and the United States in [[1984]] over visiting rights for nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered ships of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in New Zealand ports, the treaty no longer applies between the United States and New Zealand, but is still in force between either country and Australia, separately.

The US-Australia alliance under the ANZUS Treaty remains in full force. Heads of defence of one or both nations often have joined the annual ministerial meetings, which are supplemented by consultations between the U.S. Commander in Chief Pacific and the Australian Chief of Defence Force. There also are regular civilian and military consultations between the two governments at lower levels. Annual meetings to discuss ANZUS defence matters take place between the [[United States Secretary of State]] and the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs]] (AUSMIN). The 17th AUSMIN meeting took place in [[Adelaide]] in November 2005.

Unlike [[NATO]], ANZUS has no integrated defence structure or dedicated forces. However, in fulfillment of ANZUS obligations, Australia and the United States conduct a variety of joint activities. These include military exercises ranging from naval and landing exercises at the task-group level to battalion-level special forces training, assigning officers to each other's armed services, and standardizing equipment and operational doctrine. The two countries also operate several joint defence facilities in Australia, mainly ground stations for [[spy satellite|early warning satellites]], and signals intelligence gathering in South-East Asia and East Asia as part of the [[ECHELON]] network.

==History==

===Origins===
The treaty came about following the close cooperation of the United States, Australia and New Zealand during [[World War II]], during which time Australia had come perilously close to invasion by [[Japan]]. Following the end of World War II, the United States was eager to normalize relations with Japan, particularly as the [[Korean War]] was still raging a short distance from Japan. With the involvement of China and possibly the [[Soviet Union]] in Korea, the [[Cold War]] was threatening to become a full-scale war. However, Australia and New Zealand in particular were extremely reluctant to finalize a peace treaty with Japan which would allow for Japanese rearmament. Both countries relented only when an Australian and New Zealand proposal for a three-way security treaty was accepted by the United States.

The resulting treaty was concluded at [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] on [[1 September]] [[1951]], and entered into force on [[29 April]] [[1952]]. The treaty bound the signatories to recognize that an armed attack in the Pacific area on any of them would endanger the peace and safety of the others. It committed them to consult in the event of a threat and, in the event of attack, to meet the common danger in accordance with their respective constitutional processes. The three nations also pledged to maintain and develop individual and collective capabilities to resist attack.

It is interesting to note the treaty itself was not a source of debate for 30 years, though in this period New Zealand and Australia commited forces to the [[Malayan Emergency]] and subsequently the ANZUS nations fought together in the [[Vietnam War]].

===Malaya, Korea, and Vietnam===

New Zealand also fought alongside the United States in the Korea and Vietnam, and sent transport aircraft, maritime patrol aircraft and frigates to the Gulf, as well as a very small number of soldiers, [[Special Air Service of New Zealand|SAS]] soldiers, medical and assorted and peace-keeping forces in Afghanistan &amp;mdash; and despite Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] being openly critical of American justifications for the war, New Zealand did send engineers and troops to protect them to Iraq. An opinion poll in New Zealand in 2001 [http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/1991/15/15p18b.htm] showed 54% of those sampled preferred to let the treaty lapse rather than accept visits again by nuclear-armed/powered vessels. It seems from the United States point of view there is no need to rely upon ANZUS to obtain New Zealand military support.

===Australian reservations about the MX===
In [[1983]], the United States approached Australia with proposals for testing the new generation of American [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s, the [[LG-118A_Peacekeeper|MX missile]]. American test ranges in the Pacific were insufficient for testing the new long-range missiles and the United States military wished to use the [[Tasman Sea]] as a target area. Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] had agreed to provide monitoring sites near [[Sydney]] for this purpose. However in 1985 the new Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] of the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] withdrew the offer of assistance after protests from within the Left faction of the Labor Party.

===New Zealand bans nuclear ships===
In [[1985]], the nature of the ANZUS alliance changed significantly. Tensions had long been present between Australia, New Zealand and the declared nuclear powers the United States and [[France]] which had conducted nuclear tests on South Pacific islands. Following the victory of the New Zealand Labour Party in elections in [[1984]], Prime Minister [[David Lange]] enacted laws which barred [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] or [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] ships from using New Zealand ports, citing the dangers of nuclear weapons, continued nuclear testing in the South Pacific, and opposition to US President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s policy of aggressively confronting the Soviet Union. Given that the United States Navy refused to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard ships, these laws in effect refused access to New Zealand ports for all ships of the United States Navy. In February 1985, a port-visit request by the United States for the [[USS Buchanan (DDG-14)|USS ''Buchanan'']] was refused by New Zealand, as the ''Buchanan'' was capable of launching nuclear [[depth charge]]s.

On [[10 July]] [[1985]], the French [[DGSE]] bombed the [[Greenpeace]] protest vessel [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|Rainbow Warrior]] in [[Auckland]]. This event strengthened the nation's resolution to oppose in any form the military application of nuclear technology.

===The United States suspends ANZUS obligations to New Zealand===
After consultations with Australia and after negotiations with New Zealand broke down, the United States announced that it was suspending its treaty obligations to New Zealand until United States Navy ships were re-admitted to New Zealand ports, citing that New Zealand was &quot;a friend, but not an ally&quot;. The crisis made front-page headlines for weeks in many American newspapers, while many American cabinet members were quoted as expressing a deep sense of &quot;betrayal&quot;. It is still often incorrectly stated that David Lange withdrew New Zealand from ANZUS &amp;mdash; he did no such thing; his government's policy may well have led to the US's decision to suspend its treaty obligations to New Zealand, but that was still a decision of the US government, not the New Zealand government.

While the crisis with navy visits was prominent, the United States proved to be more forgiving of Australia's refusal to assist with the Peacekeeper missile. Fearing the total collapse of the ANZUS treaty, the US government decided to accommodate Australian domestic politics, particularly after [[NATO]] countries and other allies such as Japan showed little interest in taking a similar stance against nuclear weapons such as the [[MGM-31 Pershing |Pershing missile]].

===September&amp;nbsp;11, 2001 attacks===
Whilst Australia and New Zealand has fought alongside the United States before the treaty signing including in the [[Korean War]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]] (Australia only) and elsewhere the ANZUS treaty's provisions for assistance when a member nation comes under threat were officially invoked for the first time by Australia after the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack|September&amp;nbsp;11, 2001 terrorist attacks]]. Australia is also a contributor to the [[National Missile Defense]] system. [http://usembassy-australia.state.gov/ausmin/2004/missile-defense.html] [http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/releases/2003/fa151_03.html]

===East Timor===
Between 1999 and 2003 the armed forces of Australia and New Zealand deployed together in a large scale operation in [[East Timor]], to prevent pro-Indonesian Militia from overturning a vote for independence and conducting ethnic cleansing on the island. The United States provided only limited logistical support. The operation was taken over by the [[United Nations]].

===Taiwan===
One topic that became prominent in the early 2000s are its implications in the case of a hypothetical attack by the [[People's Republic of China]] against [[Taiwan]] with the [[Republic_of_China|ROC]] (Taiwan) receiving American support. While Australia has strong cultural and economic ties with the United States, it also has an increasingly important trade relationship with [[mainland China]].

In August 2004, Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] implied in Beijing that the treaty would likely not apply to that situation, but he was quickly corrected by Prime Minister [[John Howard]]. In March 2005, after an official of the [[People's Republic of China]] stated that it may be necessary for Australia to reassess the treaty and after the PRC passed an [[Anti-Secession Law]] regarding the ROC, Downer stated that in case of a PRC attack on the ROC, the treaty would come into force, but that the treaty would require only consultations with the United States and not necessarily commit Australia to war.

===The alliance today===
Annual bilateral meetings between the US Secretary of State and the Australian Foreign Minister replaced annual meetings of the ANZUS Council of Foreign Ministers. The first bilateral meeting was held in [[Canberra]] in 1985. At the second, in [[San Francisco]] in [[1986]], the United States and Australia announced that the United States was suspending its treaty security obligations to New Zealand pending the restoration of port access. Subsequent bilateral Australia-US Ministerial (AUSMIN) meetings have alternated between Australia and the United States.

The alliance engenders some political controversy in Australia. Particularly after Australian involvement in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 war on Iraq]], some quarters of Australian society have called for a re-evaluation of the relationship between the two nations. Nonetheless the alliance enjoyed broad support during the [[Cold War]] [http://assda.anu.edu.au/polls/M0004.html] and continues to enjoy broad support in Australia. [http://www.australianpolitics.com/foreign/anzus/01-06-30gnehm.shtml] [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/29/1080544419833.html?oneclick=true] One commentator in Australia has argued that the treaty should be re-negotiated in the context of terrorism, the modern role of the United Nations and as a purely US-Australian alliance. [http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=2140]

The value of the alliance was again questioned when a new US Ambassador arrived to take up his post in Wellington, New Zealand, in 2005. In his first speech on the topic of NZ-US relations the Ambassador referred to the ANZUS treaty repeatedly as &quot;Anzoo&quot;. Some commentators questioned how the Ambassador might know much about the alliance if he couldn't name it properly.

===Trivia===
An exhibit commemorating the past and present of the ANZUS Treaty is located at [[the Pentagon]].  Known as the &quot;ANZUS Corridor&quot;, it is located on the second floor of the A-ring, between Apex 1/2 and Apex 3/4.
The break down of the NZ-US relationship was dramatised on film by [[Greg McGee]] in the movie &quot;Fallout&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Axiology''', from the Greek ''axia'' (''&amp;alpha;&amp;xi;&amp;iota;&amp;alpha;'', value, worth), is the study of value or quality.  It is often thought to include [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]&amp;mdash;philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of value&amp;mdash;and sometimes it is held to lay the groundwork for these fields, and thus to be similar to [[value theory]] and [[meta-ethics]].  The term was used in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but in recent decades, [[value theory]] has tended to replace it in discussions of the nature of value or goodness in general. Main article: ''[[Goodness and value theory]]''.

One area in which research continues to be pursued is so-called ''[[formal axiology]],'' or the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with [[mathematical rigor]].

The term is also used sometimes in [[economics]].

A popular work by [[Robert M. Pirsig]], ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]],'' introduced the term &quot;axiology&quot; to a general audience, although not in any technical context.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''There is a separate article about [[The Sandman: The Doll's House|The Doll's House, the graphic novel collection of the comic book The Sandman]].''

'''''A Doll's House''''' (Original [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] title: ''Et dukkehjem'') is a [[1879]] [[play]] by [[Norway|Norwegian]] playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]]. The play was highly controversial when first published, as it is sharply critical of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[marriage]] norms. It is considered a prime example of what is called the [[Well-Made Play]].

''A Doll's House'' was made into [[A Doll's House (movie)|numerous movies]], including a [[1973]] version directed by [[Joseph Losey]].

==Plot==

{{spoiler}}

''A Doll's House'' is a scathing criticism of the traditional roles of men and women in Victorian marriage.  As Ibsen wrote in his initial notes for the play, &quot;There are two kinds of moral law, two kinds of conscience, one in man and a completely different one in woman.  They do not understand each other; but in matters of practical living the woman is judged by man’s law, as if she were not a woman but a man.&quot;

Ibsen has his [[protagonist]], Nora, leave her husband in search of the wider world, after realizing that he is not the noble creature she has supposed him to be. Her role in the marriage is that of a [[doll]], her house a &quot;[[dollhouse|Doll's House]]&quot;, and indeed her husband Torvald refers to her incessantly as his little &quot;[[starling]]&quot; and as his &quot;[[squirrel]]&quot;.  She is not even permitted a key to the [[mailbox]].  Ibsen noted, &quot;A woman cannot be herself in contemporary society, it is an exclusively male society with laws drafted by men, and with counsel and judges who judge feminine conduct from the male point of view.&quot;  When she is [[blackmail]]ed because of an improper act that she commits in order to save her husband's life&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[forgery|forging]] her father's name on a note&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; her husband shows disgust and horror at what she had done upon finding this out. His only concern is his own reputation, despite the love for him that prompts her to do it.

When the blackmailer (Krogstad) recants, it could all be over, and in a traditional Victorian drama all would then be resolved.  For Ibsen, however, and for Nora, it is too late to go back to the way things were.  Her illusions destroyed, she decides she must leave her husband, her children, and her Doll's House to discover what is truly real and what is not.  As Ibsen described it, &quot;Depressed and confused by her faith in authority, she loses faith in her moral right and ability to bring up her children. A mother in contemporary society, just as certain insects go away and die when she has done her duty in the propagation of the race.&quot;

==Critics==

To the Victorians, this was scandalous. Nothing was considered more sacrosanct than the covenant of marriage, and to portray it in such a way was completely unacceptable. Some theatre houses refused to stage the play, so Ibsen was pressed to write an alternate ending that was far less black. This distressed him considerably, and on occasion he actually submitted a &quot;correction&quot;  at the last minute to the actors on opening nights.

The '''AIM-9 Sidewinder''' is a [[heat-seeking]], short-range, [[air-to-air missile]] carried by [[fighter aircraft]]. It is named after the [[Sidewinder (snake)|Sidewinder snake]], which also detects its prey via body heat. The Sidewinder was the first really effective air-to-air missile, widely imitated and copied. Its latest variants remain in active service with many air forces.

==History==
===Early development===
The Sidewinder missile was a development of the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS), Inyokern, California, now the Naval Air Weapon Development Center, China Lake, California. It was officially designated in 1952 and was originally conceived by William Burdette McLean. 

Developed by the [[US Navy]] starting in the late [[1940s]], the Sidewinder introduced several new technologies that made it simpler and much more reliable than its [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) counterpart, the [[AIM-4 Falcon]].  After terrible experiences with the Falcon in the [[Vietnam War]], the Air Force replaced its Falcons with Sidewinders.

The primary advantage to the Sidewinder is its sophisticated, yet simple detection and guidance system. During [[World War II|WWII]] the Germans had experimented with [[infrared]] guidance systems in a large missile known as the [[Enzian missile|Enzian]], but were unable to get it to work reliably.  The Enzian was guided by an [[Infra-red|IR]] detector mounted in a small, steerable telescope.  A vane in front of the mirror shaded the detector, so the system could locate the target.  By continually turning toward the telescope, the missile was guided toward the target using what is known as a ''pure pursuit''.

The Sidewinder improved on this. The first was to replace the &quot;steering&quot; mirror with a mirror rotating around a shaft pointed out the front of the missile.  The detector was mounted in front of the mirror.  Instead of attempting to track the target in the mirror, the IR sensor would see the target as brief flashes as the mirror lined up with the target. By knowing where the flash was as the mirror spun, the direction (radially) to the target was also known.  This system could also track the radial angle to the target by timing the flashes.  If the target was further to the side, the flash seen in the detector would be shorter due to the mirror's higher rate of motion at the outside.

This signal makes the tracking system both simpler and better.  Instead of simply pointing the missile at the target (which is inefficient), the Sidewinder &quot;remembered&quot; each flash's direction and time.  By attempting to zero out the changes, instead of the difference between the detector and missile angles, the Sidewinder flies a course known as ''proportional pursuit'', which is much more efficient and makes the missile &quot;lead&quot; the target.

However this system also requires the missile to have a fixed roll axis orientation. If the missile spins at all, the timing based on the speed of rotation of the mirror is no longer accurate. Correcting for this spin would normally require some sort of sensor to tell which way is &quot;down&quot; and then adding controls to correct it. Instead, small control surfaces were placed at the rear of the missile with spinning disks on their outer surface. Airflow over the disk spins them to a high speed.  If the missile starts to roll, the gyroscopic force of the disk drives the control surface into the airflow, cancelling the motion. Thus the Sidewinder team replaced a potentially complex control system with some simple mechanical bits.

===Service entry===
A prototype Sidewinder, the '''XAAM-N-7''' (later '''AIM-9A'''), was first fired successfully in September [[1953 in aviation|1953]]. The initial production version, designated '''AAM-N-7''' (later '''AIM-9B'''), entered operational use in [[1956 in aviation|1956]], and has been improved upon steadily since. The first combat use of the Sidewinder was in [[1958 in aviation|1958]] with the air force of the [[Republic of China]] on Taiwan. During that period of time, the ROC was engaged in air battles with the [[People's Republic of China]] over the [[Taiwan Strait]]. The United States provided a few dozen Sidewinders to ROC forces, which used them to great effect against PRC [[MiG-15]]s, adding a new element to an air war which had formerly been fought only with guns. 

The Taiwan Strait battles inadvertently produced a new derivative of Sidewinder: shortly after that conflict the [[Soviet Union]] began the manufacture of the [[Vympel K-13|K-13/R-3S]] missile ([[NATO reporting name]] '''AA-2 'Atoll''''), a reverse-engineered copy of the Sidewinder. It was reportedly made possible after a Taiwanese AIM-9B hit a Chinese [[MiG-15]] without exploding, and served as a &quot;university course&quot; in missile design for Soviet engineers. The K-13 and its derivatives remained in production for nearly 30 years.

Although originally developed for the USN, the Sidewinder was subsequently adopted by the USAF as the '''GAR-8''' (later '''AIM-9E'''). During the [[1960s]] the USN and USAF pursued their own separate versions of the Sidewinder, but cost considerations later forced the development of common variants.

The Sidewinder subsequently evolved through a series of upgraded versions with newer, more sensitive seekers with various types of cooling and various propulsion, fuse, and warhead improvements.

Although each of those versions had various seeker, cooling, and fuzing differences, all but one shared infrared homing. The exception was the US Navy '''AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IB''' (later '''AIM-9C'''), a Sidewinder with a [[semi-active radar homing]] seeker head developed for the [[F-8 Crusader]]. Only about 1,000 of these weapons were produced, many of which were later rebuilt as the [[AGM-122 Sidearm]] [[anti-radiation missile]].

The '''AIM-9J Sidewinder''' version was used by the United States Air Force as well as being widely exported. An improved version of the basic AIM-9B, the main features are larger control surfaces as well as a more aerodynamic IR seeker and improved rocket motor. The missile however still has to be fired at the target from behind, a drawback of all early IR missiles.

===All-Aspect Sidewinders===
==== AIM-9L / AIM-9M / AIM-9M-7 ====
The next major advance in IR Sidewinder development was the '''AIM-9L''' ('''&quot;Lima&quot;''') model, introduced in [[1978 in aviation|1978]]. This was the first &quot;[[all-aspect]]&quot; Sidewinder with the ability to attack from all angles, including head-on. In its first combat uses by [[Israel]] over [[Lebanon]] and by the [[United Kingdom]] during the [[Falklands War]], the &quot;Lima&quot; reportedly achieved a kill ratio of around 80%, a dramatic improvement over the 10-15% levels of earlier weapons. In both cases, the users' opponents had not developed any tactics for the evasion of a head-on missile shot of this kind, making them all the more vulnerable.  

The subsequent '''AIM-9M''' ('''&quot;Mike&quot;''') has the all-aspect capability of the L model while providing all-around higher performance. The M model has improved defense against infrared countermeasures, enhanced background discrimination capability, and a reduced-smoke rocket motor. These modifications increase its ability to locate and lock on a target and decrease the missile's chances for detection. Deliveries began in [[1983 in aviation|1983]]. The '''AIM-9M-7''' was a specific modification to AIM-9M in response to threats expected in the [[Persian Gulf]] war zone. 

==== AIM-9X ====
Now entering service is the '''AIM-9X''', a new variant with an imaging infrared focal plane array seeker with claimed 90° off-boresight capability, compatibility with [[helmet-mounted sight]]s (the new U.S. [[Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System]]), and a totally new thrust-vectoring system replacing the traditional control surfaces. It retains the same motor and warhead of the &quot;Mike,&quot; but its lower drag gives it improved range and speed.

==== SIDEARM / AGM-122A ====
[[Image:Sidearm_loading.jpg|thumb|left|120px|AGM-122A SIDEARM being loaded onto an [[F-14 Tomcat]].]]

The Sidewinder was also adapted into a new missile, the '''[[AGM-122 Sidearm|AGM-122A Sidearm]]''', which is an [[Anti-radiation missile]] utilizing an AIM-9C guidance section modified to detect and track a radiating ground-based air defense system radar. The target detecting device is modified for air-to-surface use, employing forward hemisphere acquisition capability. Sidearm stocks have apparently been expended, and the weapon is no longer in the active inventory.

==== Architecture ====
The AIM-9 is made up of a number of different components manufactured by different companies including [http://www.aerojet.com/default.cfm AeroJet] and [http://www.raytheon.com Raytheon].  The missile is divided into four main sections: guidance, target detector, warhead, and rocket motor.  

The Guidance and Control Unit (GCU) contains most of the electronics and mechanics that enable the missile to function.  At the very front is the IR seeker head utilizing the rotating spindle, mirror, and five [[Photoresistor#Cadmium sulfide cells|CdS]] cells or “pan and scan” [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] (AIM-9X), [[Electric motor|electric motor]], and armature all protruding into a glass dome.  Directly behind this are the electronics that gather data, interpret signals, and generate the control signals that steer the missile.  An umbilical on the side of the GCU attaches to the launcher, which is pulled from the missile at launch.  A 5,000 [[pound-force per square inch|psig]] (35 [[megapascal|MPa]]) [[Argon|argon]] bottle or Sterling liquid nitrogen generator (AIM-9X) is used to cool the electronics.  Two electric servos power the [[Canard|canards]] to steer the missile (Except AIM-9X).  At the back of the GCU is a gas grain generator or thermal battery (AIM-9X) to provide electrical power.  The AIM-9 X features High-Off-Boresight capability, together with [[Helmet-mounted sights | JHeMoCS]] (Joint Helmet Mounted Cuing System) this missile is capable of locking on to a target that it is behind it.  The Aim-9X also features a Built-In-Test to aid in maintenance and reliability.

Next is a target detector with four IR emitters and detectors that detonate the warhead in the event of a near miss.  Versions older than the AIM-9L featured an influence fuze that relied on the targets magnetic field as input. Current trends in shielded wires and non-magnetic metals in aircraft construction rendered this obsolete.

Recent models of the AIM-9 are configured with an annular blast fragmentation [[Warhead|warhead]], the WDU-17B by Argotech Corperation.  The case is made of spirally wound spring steel filled with 8 pounds (4 kg) of PBXN-3 tritonol.  The [[Fuse (explosives)|fuze]] requires five seconds at 20 ''g'' (200 m/s²) acceleration to arm and features a safe/arm device.

The solid propellant [[Solid rocket|rocket]] motor provides propulsion for the missile.  A reduced smoke propellant makes it difficult for a target to see and avoid the missile.  This section also features the launch lugs used to hold the missile to the rail of the missile launcher.  The forward of the three lugs has two contact buttons that electrically pre-arm the warhead and activate the motor igniter.  The fins provide stability from an aerodynamic point of view but it is the rolerons at the end of the fins providing [[Precession|gyroscopic precession]] that prevents the [[snake|serpentine]] motion that gave the Sidewinder its name in the early days.  The wings and fins of the AIM-9X are smaller to accommodate its use on the [[F-22]] and this time it is the fins that do the steering while the wings up front provide stability.  The AIM-9X also features [[Thrust vectoring | Vectored Thrust]] to increase maneuverability and accuracy with four vanes inside the exhaust that move as the fins move.  The last upgrade to the missile motor on the AIM-9X is the addition of a wire harness that allows communication between the guidance section and the control section as well as a new 1760 bus to connect the guidance section with the launcher’s digital umbilical.

===Conclusion===
The Sidewinder is the most widely used air-to-air missile in the West, with more than 110,000 missiles produced for the US and 27 other nations. It has been built under license by some nations (including Sweden, which builds it under the local designation '''Rb24''').  The AIM-9 is one of the oldest, least expensive and most successful air-to-air missiles.

It has been said that the design goals for the original Sidewinder were to produce a reliable and effective missile with the &quot;electronic complexity of a table model radio and the mechanical complexity of a washing machine&quot; -- goals which were well accomplished in the early missiles. The Sidewinder is so successful that the United States Navy hosted a 50th anniversary celebration of its existence in 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:RIM-7 Sea Sparrow.jpg|thumb|300px|A RIM-7 Sea Sparrow being launched from the [[USS Essex (LHD-2)|USS ''Essex'' (LHD-2)]].]]

The '''AIM-7 Sparrow''' is a medium-range [[semi-active radar homing]] [[air-to-air missile]] operated by the [[United States Air Force]], [[US Navy]], and [[USMC]] as well as various allied air forces. Sparrow and its derivatives were the West's principal beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile from the late [[1950s]] until the [[1990s]]. It remains in service, although it is being phased out in favor of the more advanced [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]].  Its primary carrier aircraft is the [[F-14 Tomcat]], which is being phased out and therefore has not been modified to carry the AMRAAM.

The Sparrow was used as the basis for a [[surface-to-air missile]], the '''RIM-7 Sea Sparrow''', which is used by the [[US Navy]] for air defense of its ships.

==Development==
====Sparrow I====
The Sparrow emerged from a late-[[1940s]] [[US Navy]] program to develop a guided rocket weapon for air-to-air use. In [[1947 in aviation|1947]] the Navy contracted [[Sperry]] to build a [[beam-riding]] version of a standard 5-inch (127 mm) [[HVAR]], the standard unguided aerial rocket, under  '''Project Hotshot'''. The weapon was initially dubbed '''KAS-1''', then '''AAM-2''', and, from [[1948 in aviation|1948]] on, '''AAM-N-2'''. The airframe was developed by [[Douglas Aircraft]]. The diameter of the HVAR proved to be inadequate for the electronics, leading Douglas to expand the missile's airframe to 8 in (203 mm) diameter. The prototype weapon made its first aerial interception in [[1952 in aviation|1952]].

After a protracted development cycle the initial '''AAM-N-2 ''Sparrow''''' entered service in [[1956 in aviation|1956]], carried by the [[F3H Demon|F3H-2M Demon]] and [[F7U Cutlass]] [[fighter aircraft]]. Compared to the modern versions, the Sparrow I was more [[streamlined]] and featured a bullet-shaped airframe with a long pointed nose.

Sparrow I was a limited and rather primitive weapon. The limitations of beam-riding guidance (which was slaved to an optical sight, requiring visual identification of the target) restricted the missile to visual-range attacks and made it essentially useless against a maneuvering target. Only about 2,000 rounds were produced to this standard.

====Sparrow II====
As early as [[1950]] Douglas examined equipping the Sparrow with an active radar seeker, initially known as '''XAAM-N-2a ''Sparrow II''''', the original retroactively becoming '''''Sparrow I'''''. In 1952 it was given the new code '''AAM-N-3'''.

By 1955 Douglas proposed going ahead with development, intending it to be the primary weapon for the [[F5D Skylancer]] [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]], and later the [[Avro Arrow]] to be built under license by [[Canadair]]. However the small size of the missile forebody and the K-band AN/APQ-64 radar limited performance, and it was never able to work in testing.

The program was cancelled in 1958, and although there was some discussion of Canadair taking over the work, when the Arrow was cancelled all work ended.

====Sparrow III====
Concurrently, in [[1951 in aviation|1951]], [[Raytheon]] began work on the [[semi-active radar homing]] version of Sparrow family of missiles, the '''AAM-N-6 ''Sparrow III'''''. The first of these weapons entered [[US Navy]] service in [[1958 in aviation|1958]].

The '''AAM-N-6a''' was similar to the -6, but used a new [[Thiokol]] liquid-fuel rocket engine for improved performance. It also included changes to the guidance electronics to make it effective at higher closing speeds. The -6a was also selected to arm the Air Force's '''F-110A ''Spectre''''' ([[F-4 Phantom]]) fighters in 1962, known to them as the '''AIM-101'''. It entered production in 1959, eventually being built to about 7500 examples.

Another upgrade switched back to a Rocketdyne solid-fuel motor for the '''AAM-N-6b''', which started production in 1963. The new motor significantly increased range, which was up to 35 km for head-on attacks.

During this year the Navy and Air Force agreed on a standardized naming for their missiles, the Sparrows becoming the AIM-7 series. The original Sparrow I and aborted Sparrow II became the '''AIM-7A''' and '''AIM-7B''', even though both were long gone from the inventory. The -6, -6a and -6B became the '''AIM-7C''', '''AIM-7D''' and '''AIM-7E''' respectively.

25,000 AIM-7E's were produced, and saw extensive use during the [[Vietnam War]], where its performance was generally considered disappointing. The mixed results were a combination of reliability problems (exacerbated by the tropical climate), limited pilot training in fighter-to-fighter combat, and restrictive rules of engagement that generally prohibited BVR (beyond visual range) engagements. The P&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; (kill probability) of the AIM-7E was less than 10%.

In 1969 an improved version, the E-2, was introduced with clipped wings and various changes to the fusing. It was intended to be used at shorter ranges where the missile was still travelling at high speeds, making it much more useful in the visual limitations imposed on the engagements. An E-3 included additional changes to the fusing, and an E-4 featured a modified seeker for use with the [[F-14 Tomcat]].

Improved versions of the AIM-7 were developed in the [[1970s]] in an attempt to address the weapon's limitations. The '''AIM-7F''', which entered service in [[1976 in aviation|1976]], had a dual-stage rocket motor for longer range, [[solid-state electronics]] for greatly improved reliability, and a larger warhead. Even this version had room for improvement, leading [[British Aerospace]] and the Italian firm [[Selenia]] to develop advanced versions of Sparrow with better performance and improved electronics as the '''[[Skyflash]]''' and '''Selenia Aspide''', respectively.

The most common version of the Sparrow today, the '''AIM-7M''', featured a new inverse monopulse seeker (matching the capabilities of Skyflash), active radar fuse, digital controls, improved [[ECM]] resistance, and better low-altitude performance, entered service in [[1982 in aviation|1982]]. It was used to good advantage in the [[1991 Gulf War]], where it scored many USAF air-to-air kills.

The '''AIM-7P''' is similar in most ways to the M versions, and was primarily an upgrade program for existing M-series missiles. The main changes were to the software, improving low-level performance. A follow-on Block II upgrade added a new rear receiver allowing the missile to receive mid-course correction from the launching aircraft. Plans initially called for all M versions to be upgraded, but currently P's are being issued as required to replace M's lost or removed from the inventory.

The final version of the missile was to have been the '''AIM-7R''', which added an [[infra-red]] seeker to an otherwise unchanged AIM-7P Block II. A general wind-down of the budget led to it being cancelled in 1997. 

Sparrow is now being phased out with the availability of the active-radar [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], but is likely to remain in service for a number of years.

====Sea Sparrow====
Sea Sparrow was developed as a lightweight &quot;point defense&quot; weapon that could be retrofitted to existing ships, often in place of existing gun-based anti-aircraft weapons. The primary development issues were changes to the seekers to allow them to operate with shipboard radars, and a new trainable launcher system, based on the [[ASROC]] launcher, to align the seeker head with the target before launch.

As a surface-to-air system, the Sparrow has a number of disadvantages. For one, the missile steers with its mid-mounted wings, which makes them unfoldable. For this reason the missile takes up much more room than it would have to if the wings could be folded. Additionally the engine is optimized for flight time, as opposed to fast acceleration, which makes sense when launched from an aircraft moving at high speed at a target at long range. In the surface-to-air role, however, one would rather have very high acceleration in order to allow it to intercept sea-skimming targets as soon as possible.

In order to address these issues, a consortium of many Sea Sparrow users joined together to create the [[ESSM|''Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile'' ('''ESSM''')]]. The new design uses the tail-fins for steering, allowing the wings to fold. This allows the missile body to increase in size while still fitting into the same launchers, growing to 10 inches in diameter and offering far higher performance. Additionally the wing-based manuvering of the older design is designed to save energy during the long gliding period of the missile, while the tail-fin based steering of the ESSM uses up more energy but offers considerably higher manuverability while the engine is still firing.

Another recent development is the ''Jet Vane Control'' ('''JVC''') unit, which can be added to the base of the missile to allow it to be vertically launched. After being &quot;poppped&quot; from the launch cell the JVC rotates the missile to bring the seeker onto the target and level the flightpath in that direction. It is then jettisoned. Vertical launching allows a single cell to cover the entire area around the ship, because the seeker can be pointed in any direction by the JVC after launch. Additionally the time needed to point the launcher is eliminated.

The [[Egyptian Navy]] uses the Sea Sparrow for air defense of its two [[Descubierta class frigate|''Descubierta'' class light frigates]].

==Description==
The Sparrow has four major sections: guidance section, [[warhead]], control, and rocket motor (currently the Hercules MK-58 solid-propellant rocket motor). It has a cylindrical body with four wings at mid-body and four tail fins. Although the external dimensions of the Sparrow remained relatively unchanged from model to model, the internal components of newer missiles represent major improvements, with vastly increased capabilities. The warhead is of the [[continuous-rod warhead|continuous-rod]] type.

As with other semi-active radar guided missiles, the missile does not generate radar signals, but instead homes in on reflected continuous-wave signals from the launch platform's radar. The receiver also senses the guidance radar to enable comparisons that enhance the missile's resistance to passive jamming.

==Principle of guidance (semi-active version)==
The launching aircraft will illuminate the target with its radar. In radars of the 1950's these were single target tracking devices using a nutating horn as part of its antenna. This caused the beam to be swept in a small cone. Signal processing would be applied to determine the direction of maximum illumination and so develop a signal to steer the antenna toward the target. The missile detects the reflected signal from the target with a high gain antenna in a similar fashion and steers the entire missile toward closure with the target. The missile guidance also samples a portion of the illuminating signal via rearward pointing [[waveguide]]s. The comparison of these two signals enabled logic circuits to determine the true target reflection signal, even if the target were to eject radar-reflecting [[chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]].

==Specifications (AIM-7M)==
* '''Length''': 12 ft (3600 mm)
* '''Diameter''': 8 in (203 mm) 
* '''Wingspan''': 2 ft 8 in (81 mm)
* '''Launch weight''': 510 lb (231 kg)
* '''Speed''': Mach 4
* '''Range''': 44 mi (70 km)
* '''Guidance''': semi-active radar homing
* '''Warhead''': 88 lb (40 kg) blast fragmentation

The '''AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile''', or '''AMRAAM''' (pronounced am-ram), commonly known to air crews as the &quot;Slammer,&quot; is a modern [[air-to-air missile|air-to-air]] [[missile]] (AAM).

==Politico-historical background==
AMRAAM was developed as the result of an agreement, no longer in effect, among the United States and several other [[NATO]] nations to develop air-to-air missiles and to share production technology.  Under this agreement the U.S. was to develop the next generation medium range missile (AMRAAM) and Europe would develop the next generation short range missile ([[ASRAAM]]). The breakdown in this agreement lead to Europe developing the [[MBDA Meteor]], a competitor to AMRAAM and the U.S. pursuing upgrades of the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]. After protracted development, deployment of AMRAAM (AIM-120A) began in September [[1991 in aviation|1991]].

The eastern counterpart of AMRAAM is the very similar [[Russian Air Force|Russian]] [[R-77 AA-12 Adder]], commonly known in the west as &quot;Amraamski.&quot;

==Operational features summary==
AMRAAM has an all-weather, beyond-visual-range capability. It improves the aerial combat capabilities of U.S. and allied aircraft to meet the future threat of enemy air-to-air weapons. AMRAAM serves as a follow-on to the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] missile series. The new missile is faster, smaller, and lighter, and has improved capabilities against low-altitude targets. It also incorporates an active radar in conjunction with an inertial reference unit and micro-computer system, which makes the missile less dependent upon the fire-control system of the aircraft.

Once the missile closes in on the target, its active [[radar]] guides it to intercept. This feature, called &quot;[[fire and forget]],&quot; frees the pilot from the need to continuously illuminate the missile's target with a radar lock, enabling the pilot to aim and fire several missiles simultaneously at multiple targets and perform evasive maneuvers while the missiles guide themselves to the targets.

==Guidance system overview==
===Interception course stage===
AMRAAM uses two-stage [[missile guidance|guidance]] when fired at long range. The aircraft passes data to the missile just before launch, giving it information about the location of the target aircraft from the launch point and its direction and speed. The missile uses this information to fly on an interception course to the target using its built in [[inertial navigation system]] (INS). This information is generally obtained using the launching aircraft's [[radar]], although it could come from an [[infra-red]] search and tracking system ([[IRST]]), from a [[Joint Tactical Information Distribution System|data link]] from another fighter aircraft, or from an [[AWACS]] aircraft. 

If the firing aircraft or surrogate continues to track the target, periodic updates are sent to the missile telling it of any changes in the target's direction and speed, allowing it to adjust its course so that it is able to close to self-homing distance while keeping the target aircraft in the ''basket'' in which it will be able to find it.

Not all AMRAAM users have elected to purchase the mid-course update option, which limits AMRAAM's effectiveness in some scenarios. The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] initially opted not to use mid-course update for its [[RAF_Tornado_F3|Tornado F3]] force, only to discover that without it, testing proved the AMRAAM was less effective in BVR engagements than the older [[semi-active radar homing]] [[Skyflash|BAE Skyflash]] weapon--the AIM-120's own radar is necessarily of limited range and power compared to that of the launch aircraft.

===Terminal stage and impact===
Once the missile closes to self-homing distance, it turns on its active radar seeker and searches for the target aircraft. If the target is in or near the expected location, the missile will find it and guide itself to the target from this point. If the missile is fired at short range (typically, visual range), it can use its active seeker just after launch, making the missile truly [[fire-and-forget]]. At the point where an AMRAAM switches to autonomous self-guidance, the NATO brevity word &quot;pitbull&quot; would be called out on the radio to inform other pilots, just as &quot;Fox Three&quot; would be called out upon launch.

==Kill probability and tactics==
===General considerations===
Once in its terminal mode, the missile's advanced electronic-counter-counter-measure ([[ECCM]]) support and good maneuverability mean that the chance of it hitting or exploding close to the target is high (on the order of 90%), as long as it has enough remaining energy to maneuver with the target if it is evasive. The [[probability of kill|kill probability]] (PK) is determined by several factors, including aspect (head-on interception, side-on or tail-chase), altitude, the speed of the missile and the target, how hard the target can turn, etc. Typically, if the missile has a sufficient amount of energy during the terminal phase, which comes from being launched close enough to the target from an aircraft flying high and fast enough, it will have an excellent chance of success. This chance drops as the missile is fired at longer ranges as it runs out of overtake speed at long ranges, and if the target can force the missile to turn it might bleed off enough speed that it can no longer chase the target.

===Lower-capability targets===
This leads to two main engagement scenarios. If the target(s) is/are not armed or not armed with any medium or long-range [[fire-and-forget]] weapons, the aircraft firing the AMRAAM need only to get close enough to the target, depending upon whether the target is heading towards or away from the firing aircraft, and launch the missile(s) to have a reasonable chance of hitting. Especially against low-maneuverability targets, in this situation the missiles are unlikely to miss. If the target aircraft are approaching the launching aircraft, especially if they are moving fast, the missile can be launched at long range since the range will be closing fast. In this situation, even if the target(s) turn around, it is unlikely they can speed up and fly away fast enough to avoid being overtaken and hit by the missile(s) (as long as the missiles are not released too early). It is also unlikely they can outmaneuver the missiles since the closure rate will be so great. In a tail-on engagement, the firing aircraft might have to close to between one-half and one-quarter maximum range (or maybe even more for a very fast target) in order to give the missile sufficient energy to overtake the targets.

If the targets are armed with missiles, the [[fire-and-forget]] nature of the AMRAAM is invaluable, enabling the launching aircraft to fire missiles at the target and then turn and run away. Even if the targets have longer-range [[semi-active radar homing]] ([[SARH]]) missiles, they will have to chase the launching aircraft in order for the missiles to track them, effectively flying right into the AMRAAM. If the target aircraft fire missiles and then turn and runs away, their own missiles will not be able to hit. Of course, if the target aircraft have long range missiles, even if they are not [[fire-and-forget]], the fact that they force the launching aircraft to turn and run reduces the kill probability, since it is possible that without the mid-course updates the missiles will not find the target aircraft. However the chance of success is still good and compared to the relative impunity the launching aircraft enjoy, this gives the AMRAAM-equipped aircraft a decisive edge. If one or more missiles fail to hit, the AMRAAM-equipped aircraft can turn and re-engage, although they will be at a disadvantage compared to the chasing aircraft due to the speed they lose in the turn, and would have to be careful that they're not being tracked with [[SARH]] missiles.

===Similarly armed targets===
The other main engagement scenario is against other aircraft with [[fire-and-forget]] missiles like the [[Vympel R-77]] (NATO AA-12 &quot;Adder&quot;) - perhaps [[MiG-29]]s, [[Su-27]]s or similar. In this case engagement is very much down to teamwork and could be described as &quot;a game of chicken.&quot; Both flights of aircraft can fire their missiles at each other beyond visual range (BVR), but then face the problem that if they continue to track the target aircraft in order to provide mid-course updates for the missile's flight, they are also flying into their opponents' missiles. This is why teamwork is so important and advanced missiles with guidance systems with hand-off capability can help overcome this problem. The other main tactic would be to sneak up behind the enemy aircraft and launch missiles without them noticing, giving the launching aircraft sufficient time to leave the danger zone of the enemy after launching. Even if the enemy detects the launch and turns around, the speed and possibly altitude it loses during the turn puts its missiles at an energy disadvantage which may be sufficient for the other aircraft to defeat it successfully. This typically requires excellent [[ground-control intercept]] (GCI) or airborne radar ([[AWACS]] - Airborne Warning and Control System) facilities in order to be successful.

==Variants and upgrades==
===Air-to-air missile versions===
There are currently three variants of AMRAAM, all in service with the [[United States Air Force]] and [[USN]]. The AIM-120A is no longer in production and shares the enlarged wings and fins with the successor AIM-120B currently in production. The AIM-120C has smaller &quot;clipped&quot; aerosurfaces to enable internal carriage on the USAF [[F-22A Raptor]]. AIM-120B deliveries began in [[1994 in aviation|1994]], and AIM-120C deliveries began in [[1996 in aviation|1996]]. 

The AIM-120C has been steadily upgraded since it was introduced. The AIM-120C-6 contained an improved fuze (Target Detection Device) compared to its predecessor. The AIM-120C-7 development began in [[1998]] and included improvements in homing and greater range (actual amount of improvement unspecified). It was successfully tested in 2003 and is currently being introduced into active service (early 2005). It helps the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] replace the [[F-14 Tomcat]]s which are being retired and replaced with [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]s&amp;mdash;the loss of the [[F-14]]'s long-range [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] missiles (already retired) can be partially offset with a longer-range AMRAAM but note that the AMRAAM does not have a longer range than the Phoenix.

The AIM-120D is a planned upgraded version of the AMRAAM with improvements in almost all areas, including 50% greater range (than the already long range AIM-120C-7) and better guidance over its entire flight envelope yielding an improved kill probability ([[Probability of kill|PK]]). 

There are also plans for [[Raytheon]] to develop a [[Ramjet]]-powered derivative of the AMRAAM, the Future Medium Range Air-Air Missile (FMRAAM). It is not known whether the FMRAAM will be produced since the target market, the British Ministry of Defence has chosen the [[MBDA_Meteor|Meteor missile]] over the FMRAAM for a [[BVR]] missile for the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] aircraft.

===Ground-launch systems===
[[Raytheon]] successfully tested launching AMRAAM missiles from a five-missile carrier on an [[HMMWV]] (hum-vee). They receive their initial guidance information from a radar not mounted on the vehicle (probably the [[MPQ-64 Sentinel]] radar system or possibly a [[Patriot missile|PATRIOT]] missile battery radar) and help to provide low-level, close-in defence while the PATRIOT system engages targets at higher altitudes and further ranges. The missile's range would be lower when launched from the ground, due to the lack of speed or altitude of the launch vehicle. This system will be known as the '''HUMRAAM''' (a contraction of HUMVEE and AMRAAM).

The [[NASAMS|Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System]] (NASAMS), developed by [[Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace]], consists of a number of vehicle-pulled launch batteries (containing six AMRAAMs each) along with separate radar trucks and control station vehicles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''AGM-84 ''Harpoon''''' is a [[United States|U.S.]] all-weather, over-the-horizon, [[anti-ship missile|anti-ship]] [[cruise missile]] system, originally developed by [[McDonnell Douglas]], with development and manufacturing now taken over by [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems]]. In 2004, Boeing delivered the 7000th Harpoon unit since the weapon's introduction in 1977. The missile system has also been further developed into a coastal strike version, the '''AGM-84E Standoff Land Attack Missile''' ('''SLAM''').
[[Image:Harpoon asm bowfin museum.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Harpoon missile on display at the [[USS Bowfin (SS-287)|USS ''Bowfin'']] [[museum]] at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]].]]

Harpoon uses [[active radar homing]] and low-level, sea-skimming cruise trajectory to improve survivability and effectiveness. The missile's launch platform options include:
*[[warship|surface ship]]s ('''RGM-84''', fitted with a [[solid rocket]] launch booster that detaches when expended to allow the missile's integral [[turbojet]] to maintain flight)
*[[submarine]]s ('''UGM-84''', fitted with a solid-rocket launch booster and encapsulated in a container to enable submerged launch through a torpedo tube)
*[[airplane]]s ('''AGM-84''', without the booster)
*coastal defense batteries

The chief competitor of the ''Harpoon'' is the French ''[[Exocet]]''.

==Versions and operators==

===Original Harpoon===
Initially developed for the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] to serve as its basic anti-ship missile for fleet-wide use, the '''AGM-84D''' has been adapted for use on Air Force [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52G bombers]], which can carry from eight to 12 of the missiles. The AGM-84E has been adapted for use on the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]], in use by both the [[United States|USA]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] can fire AGM-84 series missiles from its [[General Dynamics F-111#F-111C|F-111C/G Aardvark]], [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and [[P-3 Orion|AP-3C Orion]] aircraft.  The [[Egyptian Navy]] uses the Harpoon SSM to equip eight [[frigate]]s and four [[submarine]]s.

The AGM-84A was first introduced in [[1977]], and in [[1979]] an air-launched version was deployed on the Navy's P-3 Orion aircraft.

===Harpoon Block II===
[[Image:Harpoon-block-II-launch.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Harpoon Block II test firing from [[USS Decatur (DDG-73)|USS ''Decatur'']].]]

In production at Boeing facilities in [[Saint Charles, Missouri|St. Charles, Mo.]] is the '''Harpoon II''', intended to offer an expanded engagement envelope and advanced [[electronic countermeasures|counter measures]] together with improved targeting. The key improvements of the Harpoon II are obtained by incorporating the [[inertial measurement unit]] from the [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] program, and the software, computer, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]/inertial navigation system and GPS antenna/receiver from the '''SLAM-ER''' ('''''E'''xpanded '''R'''esponse'', an upgrade to the AGM-84E SLAM).

The first international customer for Harpoon Block II systems was the [[Royal Danish Navy]], which ordered 50 upgrade kits in 1997; the first systems were delivered in 2002.

The '''AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-radiation Missile (HARM)''' is an air-to-surface tactical [[missile]] designed to seek out and destroy enemy [[radar]]-equipped air defense systems. The missile was originally developed by [[Texas Instruments]] as a replacement for the [[AGM-78 Standard]] ARM system. Production was later taken over by [[Raytheon Corporation]].

The AGM-88 can detect, attack and destroy a target with minimal aircrew input. The proportional guidance system that homes in on enemy radar emissions has a fixed antenna and seeker head in the missile's nose. A smokeless, solid-propellant, [[dual-thrust]] [[rocket motor]] propels the missile at speeds up to [[Mach number|Mach]] 4.

The HARM missile was approved for full production in March [[1983]]. It proved effective against [[Libya|Libyan]] targets in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] in [[1986]], and was used extensively by the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Air Force]] for Operation Desert Storm during the [[Gulf War]] of [[1991]].

*The [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Fleet Air Arm]] of the [[United Kingdom]] under a number of variants and versions starting in the late 1980s, including the GR7, T10, FRS1, FA.2 and T4 versions. (''see [[RAF Harrier II]], [[BAE Sea Harrier]] '')
*[[United States Marine Corps]] as the [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B]] and TAV-8B starting in 1985.
*The [[Spanish Navy|Spanish Naval air wing]] (''Arma Aerea De La Armada'') as the [[EAV-8B]], AV8-S and TAV-8S.
*The [[Marina Militare|Italian Navy air wing]] (''Aviazione per la Marina Militare'') as the AV-8B and TAV-8.
*The [[Indian Navy]] as the FRS51 and T60.

The Harrier II is also notable in history as an example of U.S.-U.K cooperation and of [[Cold War]] defense achievements. Of note is the U.S aid funding early development under the [[Mutual Weapons Development Program]] (MWDP) and the salvaging of what was left of [[AV-16A Advanced Harrier Program]] by McDonnell Douglas, making the second-generation family possible.  

==History==
===Introduction===
The aircraft had its direct origins in a Joint U.S.-British project (Hawker-Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas Aircraft) for a much-improved Harrier aircraft, to be the AV-16A Advanced Harrier program. However cost over-runs in engine development on the part of Rolls Royce and in the aircraft development caused the British to pull out of the program. Interest remained in the U.S. so a less ambitious, though still expensive project was undertaken by McDonnell on their own catered to U.S. needs. Using things learned from AV-16A development, though dropping some things such as further Pegasus development, the development work continued leading the AV-8B for the U.S. Marine Corps. The aircraft was centered on the Marine's needs, light ground attack and was focused on payload and range as opposed to speed. In the late 1970 the British re-entered development of their own second generation Harrier based on the U.S. design leading eventually to the GR.5, which had somewhat different performance goals.

===Overview and Use===
The '''AV-8B''' is an extensively redesigned aircraft with a new [[composite material|composite]] wing, new cockpit and [[avionics]] (e.g., FLIR and new bombing system), and more powerful engine. The new wing enables higher take-off weights and more ordnance. The payload was nearly double and the range much increased over the older design, one of the chief complaints with the older type. It was focused primarily on close-air support, and all the added capabilities came at the cost of about 50 mph (80 km/h) slower speed. The AV-8B was put into service in January [[1985 in aviation|1985]] at a cost of US$21.6 million each. The design was further developed into later types with high-speed, that placed less focus on payload and range.

The primary mission of the AV-8B in [[USMC]] service is to provide responsive close air support for ground forces. This single-piloted, advanced V/STOL aircraft can operate from short fields, forward sites, roads and surface ships providing minimum response time to targets. Recent AV-8B II+ have an expanded secondary air-to-air role.

Three AV-8B squadrons stationed about 40 miles (64 km) from the [[Kuwait|Kuwaiti]] border, were the most forward deployed tactical strike aircraft during Operation [[Desert Storm]] and operated from relatively unprepared sites. One AV-8B squadron and one six-aircraft detachment operated off the landing helicopter ship [[USS Nassau|''USS Nassau'']] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. The average turnaround time during the ground war surge was 23 minutes.  A total of 86 [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] Harriers flew 3,567 sorties against [[Iraq]]i targets in [[Kuwait]] and Iraq.  Five Harriers were lost&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; four in combat.  Following the war, Marine Corps analysis showed that the placement of the engine nozzles that allow for the Harrier's Vertical Take-Off/Landing made the aircraft far more vulnerable to [[infrared]] [[surface-to-air missile]] fire than other aircraft. This is because the nozzles are almost dead center on the aircraft, which means that when infra-red guided missiles hit they generally damage a greater number of systems.

In the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Harrier II versions saw extensive usage by both the USMC and RAF. USMC Harriers were based on two USMC amphibious assault ships, [[USS Bataan (LHD-5)|''USS Bataan'' (LHD-5)]] and [[USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6)|''USS Bonhomme Richard'' (LHD-6)]]. Each carried 24 Harriers, about four times their normal complement of fixed-wing aircraft, and tried out the long dormant secondary purpose of the LHDs and LHAs, that of a small aircraft carrier, or sea control ship. RAF Harriers were shore-based in Kuwait. Two detachments from [[RAF Cottesmore]] were sent to the region, with one known to have been based at the Ahmed al Jaber Air Base ({{coor dms|28|56|05|N|47|47|31|E}}) in Kuwait, and the other at an undisclosed location. A total of 23 RAF Harriers took part in the campaign; one USMC Harrier crashed into the [[Persian Gulf]] early in the war while trying to land on the ''USS Nassau''. The pilot ejected.

The current AV-8B Remanufacture Program converts older AV-8B day attack aircraft to the most recent production radar/night attack configuration. This radar-equipped version of the AV-8B, called the AV-8B II+, became operational in the summer of [[1994 in aviation|1994]]. The AV-8B II+ uses the same [[AN/APG-65]] radar system as the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and is able to carry [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] missiles, giving the aircraft a considerable increase in anti-aircraft capabilities. However, these missiles are most likely to be deployed as a means of self-defense or airbase defense instead of air superiority, because despite its agility, the Harrier is subsonic and therefore slower than most fighters. 

'''Avionics:''' [[AN/APG-65]] radar, ASB-19(V) angle-rate bombing system, laser spot tracker, TV tracker, CEC-Marconi [[FLIR]], [[GPS]]

==Manufacture==
Aircraft were built by McDonnell Douglas and [[BAE Systems]] the latter at their [[Warton]] facility in [[Preston]], [[Lancashire]] in the [[UK]]. The factory is also home to the [[Panavia Tornado]], [[SEPECAT Jaguar]], [[BAE Hawk|BAe Hawk T1]] , [[Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod#MRA4|BAe Nimrod MRA4]] and more currently being built there the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]].

The aircraft is known mainly as the '''AV-8B''' in [[USMC]] service and the '''[[RAF Harrier II|GR7/GR9]]''' in RAF service. The '''AV-8A''' (and also TAV-8A versions) , which was the previous generation of Harrier and should not be confused with the next generation, was a [[Hawker-Siddeley Harrier#Harrier GR.3|Hawker-Siddeley Harrier GR.3]] procured for the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]].

==Variants==
Harrier II variants can vary significantly depending on the exact model, even among a single country's aircraft. 

* '''YAV-8B''' 
* '''AV-8B''' Harrier II&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Two versions were developed.  The first was commonly known as the &quot;Day Attack&quot; variant.  Later, a &quot;Night Attack&quot; variant was fielded (1991).  The Night Attack Harrier incorporated a Navigation Forward Looking Infrared camera (NAV FLIR) and the cockpit was made compatible with night vision goggles (NVGs).  It was also able to use the larger Rolls Royce engine.  The II+ described below is identical to the Night Attack variant, except it incorporates an APG-65 radar, the same as in early F/A-18 Hornets.
* '''AV-8B II+'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; AV-8B with radar (APG-65) allowing firing of radar guided air-to-air missiles; should be designated '''AV-8C'''.
* '''AV-8C'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; An experimental version developed from the AV-8B model
* '''TAV-8B''' Harrier II&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; A two-seat trainer version

* '''EAV-8B'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Spanish Navy version

* '''Harrier GR5'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; First RAF version of [[RAF Harrier II]]
* '''Harrier GR7'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Avionics upgrade to GR5
* '''Harrier GR7A'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; GR7 with more powerful engine
* '''Harrier GR9'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Avionics upgrade to GR7
