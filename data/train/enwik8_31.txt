A '''minute of arc''', '''arcminute''', or '''MOA''' is a unit of [[angle|angular measurement]], equal to one sixtieth (1/60) of one [[degree (angle)|degree]]. Since one degree is defined as one three hundred and sixtieth (1/360) of a circle, 1 MOA is 1/21600 of the amount of arc in a closed circle, or (&amp;pi;/10800) [[radian]]s. Its usage is limited to those fields which require a handy unit for the expression of very small amounts of arc, such as [[astronomy]]. The symbol for marking the arcminute is the [[prime (mark)|prime]] (&amp;#8242;) (&lt;code&gt;U+2032&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;prime;&lt;/code&gt;). One arcminute would be 1&amp;#8242; (or 1''&amp;#39;'').  It is also abbreviated as '''arcmin''', or less commonly the prime with an arch over it (&lt;math&gt;\hat {'}&lt;/math&gt;), or '''amin'''.

The subdivision of the minute of arc is the [[arcsecond]].

==Uses==
===Firearms===
This unit is commonly found in the [[firearms]] industry and literature, particularly that concerning high-powered [[rifle]]s. It is popular because 1 MOA almost exactly subtends one [[inch]] at 100 [[yard]]s, a traditional distance on [[Shooting range|target ranges]]. A shooter can easily readjust his or her rifle [[telescopic sight|scope]] simply by measuring the distance in inches the bullet hole is from the desired impact point, and adjusting the scope that many MOA in the opposite direction. Most target scopes designed for long distances are adjustable in quarter (1/4) or eighth (1/8) MOA &quot;clicks&quot;. One eighth MOA is equal to approximately an eighth of an inch at 100 yards or one inch at 800 yards.

Sometimes, a firearm will be &quot;measured&quot; in MOA. This simply means that under ideal conditions, the gun is capable of repeatedly producing a group of shots that fit into a circle, the diameter of which can be subtended by that amount of arc. (E.g.: a &quot;1 MOA rifle&quot; should be capable, under ideal conditions and when locked into a [[vise]], of shooting a 1-inch group at 100 yards.) However, ideal performance in a [[ballistics]] lab is often very different from real-world results.

===Cartography===
Minutes of angle (and its subunit, seconds of angle or SOA&amp;mdash;equal to a sixtieth of a MOA) are also used in [[cartography]] and [[navigation]]. At [[sea level]], one minute of angle equals about 1.15 [[mile]]s or 1.86 [[kilometre|km]], approximately one [[nautical mile]] (approximately, because the [[Earth]] is slightly [[oblate]]). In humans, the ability to resolve a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc is considered normal [[visual acuity]].
			
Traditionally positions are given using degrees, minutes, and seconds of angles in two measurements: one for [[latitude]], the angle north or south of the [[equator]]; and one for [[longitude]], the angle east or west of the [[Prime Meridian]]. Using this method, any position on or above the face of the Earth can be precisely given. However, because of the somewhat clumsy base-60 nature of MOA and SOA, many people now prefer to give positions using degrees only, expressed in decimal form to an equal amount of precision. Degrees, given to three decimal places, give almost as much accuracy as degrees-minutes-seconds.

===Astronomy===
Similarly to cartography above, [[astronomy]] also uses the arcminute.  It is worth noting that degrees (and therefore arcminutes) are used to measure only [[declination]], or angular distance north or south of the [[celestial equator]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alberto Giacometti''' ([[October 10]], [[1901]] &amp;ndash; [[January 11]], [[1966]]) was a Swiss  [[Sculpture|sculptor]] and [[painter]]. Giacometti was talented in four mediums &amp;mdash; sculpture, painting, drawing and printmaking.

==Artistic analysis==

Giacometti was a key player in the Existentialist movement. Some would describe his work as [[Formalism (art)|Formalist]], but others might argue it is [[Expressionism (art) | Expressionist]] or otherwise having to do with what [[Gilles Deleuze | Deleuze]] would call 'blocs of sensation' (as in Deleuze's analysis of [[Francis Bacon (painter) |Francis Bacon]]). Even after his excommunication from the [[surrealism|Surrealist]] group, while the intention of his sculpting was usually imitation, the end products were undoubtedly an expression, not of the physical form of the subject, but of his emotional response to it. He attempted to create renditions of his models the way he saw them, and the way he thought they ought to be seen.

&quot;All the sculptures of today, like those of the past, will end one day in pieces... So it is important to fashion ones work carefully in its smallest recess and charge every particle of matter with life.&quot;

Giacometti Sculptures, Tudor Publishing, NY, 1964

==Biography==

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Giacometti.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Alberto Giacometti.]] --&gt;

While having been born in Borgonovo in [[Val Bregaglia]], [[Switzerland]] near the Italian border, Alberto Giacometti spent most of his childhood in the nearby town of Stampa. His father was a Swiss Impressionist who encouraged his son's interest in sculpture.

After finishing high school, Giacometti moved to [[Geneva]] to attend the School of Fine Arts. In 1922 he moved to Paris to study at the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]] in [[Montparnasse]] under [[Auguste Rodin]]'s associate, the sculptor [[Antoine Bourdelle]]. It was there that Giacometti experimented with the [[cubism|cubist]] method. Drawn more to the [[surrealist]] movement, after his brother, Diego Giacometti, joined him as his assistant by 1927 Alberto displayed his first surrealist sculptures at Salon des Tuileries. Before long, he was regarded as one of the leading surrealist sculptors of the day.

[[Image:ThreeMenWalkingII.JPG|thumbnail|left|250px|''Three Men Walking II'']]

Living in the creative community of [[Montparnasse]], he associated with artists [[Joan Miró]], [[Max Ernst]] and [[Pablo Picasso]], plus writers [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Paul Eluard]] and [[André Breton]], and wrote and drew for Breton's magazine ''[[Le Surréalisme au Service de la Révolution]]''.

From 1935 to 1940 Giacometti concentrated his sculpting on the human head, focusing on the model's gaze, followed by a unique artistic phase in which his statues became stretched out &amp;mdash; their limbs elongated.

During [[World War II]], he lived in the safety of Geneva where he met Annette Arm. In 1946 he and Arm returned to Paris where in 1949 they married. Giacometti's most productive period followed the marriage. His wife provided him with the opportunity to constantly to be in touch with another human body, particularly a feminine one. Models who had posed for him found it a difficult job, but Arm patiently sat for him for hours until he achieved what he wanted. 

He soon had an exhibition of his works at the Gallery Maeght in Paris and at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in [[New York City]] for which his friend, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], wrote the catalogue's preface.

By the early 1950s, the use of bronze had become affordable (metals were in short supply during World War II) and Giacometti began to cast his works in [[bronze sculpture|bronze]] with the help of his brother Diego, who posed for the artist and worked as his assistant until Giacometti's death.

Obsessed with creating his sculptures exactly as he envisioned through his unique view of reality, to his own consternation and because of his drive for perfection, he carved them very small &amp;mdash; many no larger than a pack of cigarettes and almost as thin as nails. A friend of his once said that if Giacometti decided to carve you, ''he would make your head look like the blade of a knife.'' However, after his marriage, he was able to make tiny sculptures larger. But the larger that they grew, the thinner they became. Giacometti said that was the way he wanted to represent the sensation he felt when he looked at a naked woman. 

[[Image:GiacomettiRued'Alesia.jpg|thumb|none|right|250px]]
Commissioned to design a medallion depicting [[Henri Matisse]] in 1954, he created numerous masterful drawings of the great painter in the last months of Matisse's life.

1956 saw a further development in his work when he began to produce paintings of recognizable likenesses.

In 1962, he was awarded the grand prize for sculpture at the [[Venice Biennale]], and the award brought with it worldwide celebrity. Even when he had achieved popularity and his works were in demand, he still reworked models, often destroying them or setting them aside to be returned to years later.

The prints produced by Giacometti are often overlooked but the catalogue raisonné ''Giacometti - The Complete Graphics and 15 Drawings'' by Herbert Lust (Tudor 1970) comments on their impact and gives details of the number of copies of each print. Some of his most important images were in editions of only 30 and many were described as rare in 1970.

In his later years, Giacometti creations displayed at a number of large exhibitions throughout Europe. Riding a wave of international popularity, in 1965, despite being in poor health, he traveled to the [[United States]] for an exhibition of his works at the [[New York Museum of Modern Art]].

As his last work he prepared the text for the book ''Paris sans fin'', a sequence of 150 lithographs containing memories of all the places where he had lived. 

Alberto Giacometti died in 1966 of heart disease and chronic bronchitis at the Kantonsspital in [[Chur]], Switzerland. His body was returned to his birthplace in Borgonovo, where he was interred close to his parents. He is featured on the one hundred Swiss Franks banknote.

In 2003 an animated short film called [http://www.eternalgaze.com/ Eternal Gaze] was made by Sam Chen in memory of Alberto Giacometti.

==Legacy==

Before 2005, a sculpture by Giacometti sold for as much as [[United States dollar|$]]14 million.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term '''Abstinence''' refers to a voluntary forbearance from indulging a desire or appetite for certain bodily activities that are widely experienced as giving pleasure. Most frequently, the term refers to abstention from sexual intercourse, alcohol, or food. The practice can arise from religious prohibitions or practical considerations.

Abstinence has diverse forms. In its oldest sense it is sexual, as in the practice of [[continence]], [[chastity]], and [[celibacy]]. Commonly it refers to a temporary or partial abstinence from food, as in fasting. Because the regimen is intended to be a conscious act, freely chosen to enhance life, abstinence is sometimes distinguished from the psychological mechanism of [[repression (psychological)|repression]]. The latter is an unconscious state, having unhealthy consequences. Freud termed the channelling of sexual energies into other more culturally or socially acceptable activities &quot;sublimation&quot;.

==Abstinence in religion==
It may arise from an ascetic element present in most religions, or from a subjective need for spiritual discipline. In its religious context, abstinence is meant to elevate the believer beyond the normal life of desire, to a chosen ideal, by following a path of renunciation. 

For Jews, the principal fast day is [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement. For Muslims, the period of fasting lasts during the whole month of [[Ramadan]], from dawn to dusk. Both Jews and Muslims abstain from pork in their regular diet.  Among Christians, Roman Catholics have traditionally abstained from food and drink prior to taking [[Holy Communion]]. They distinguish between [[fasting]] and abstinence; the former referring to the discipline of taking one full meal a day, and the latter signifying a meatless meal on  fast days, such as Fridays during [[Lent]]. Many Protestants have preferred to abstain from imbibing alcohol and the use of tobacco. [[Mormon]]s and [[Seventh Day Adventist]]s abstain from certain foods and drinks by combining spiritual discipline with health concerns. 

In India, [[Buddhist]]s and [[Jain]]s, and a number of Hindus abstain from eating meat on the grounds both of health and of reverence for all sentient forms of life. Total abstinence from feeding on the flesh of cows is a hallmark of [[Hinduism]]. 
 
==Environmentalism==
The environmental movement does not necessarily advocate abstinence from bodily pleasures such as sex, but it does promote a lifestyle in harmony with the simplicity of nature, due to the limitations of non-renewable resources. Echoes of the temperance movement, organized by women such as [[Susan B. Anthony]] to persuade people to abstain--fully or partially--from alcoholic drink, can be seen in the organization [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD).

An '''anthem''' is a choral composition to an English religious text sung in church services.  The term has evolved to mean a song of celebration, usually acting as a symbol for a certain group of people, as in the term &quot;[[national anthem]]&quot;.  ''See below for other uses.''

==History==
The word &quot;anthem&quot; is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;alpha;&amp;nu;&amp;tau;&amp;iota;&amp;phi;&amp;omega;&amp;nu;&amp;alpha; through the Saxon
''antefn'', a word which originally had the same meaning as [[antiphony]].

It is now, however, generally restricted to a form of church music, particularly in the service of the [[Church of England]], in which it is appointed by the rubrics to follow the third collect at both morning and evening prayer. It is just as usual in this place to have an ordinary [[hymn]] as an anthem, which may be a more elaborate composition than the congregational hymns. Several anthems are included in the [[Coronation of the British monarch|English coronation service]]. The words are selected from Holy Scripture or in some cases from the Liturgy, and the music is generally more elaborate and varied than that of psalm or hymn tunes. Though the anthem of the Church of England is analogous to the [[motet]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran Church]]es, both being written for a trained choir and not for the congregation, it is as a musical form essentially English in its origin and development. 

The anthem developed as a replacement for the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] &quot;votive antiphon&quot; commonly sung as an appendix to the main office to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] or other saints.  Though anthems were written in the Elizabethan period by [[William Byrd|Byrd]], [[Thomas Tallis|Tallis]] and others they are not mentioned in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] until [[1662]], when the famous rubric ''In quires and places where they sing here followeth the Anthem'' first appears.  

Early anthems tend to be simple and [[homophony|homophonic]] in texture, in order that the words could be clearly heard.  Late in the [[16th century]] the &quot;verse anthem,&quot; in which passages for solo voices alternated with passages for full choir, began to evolve.  This became the dominant form in the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period, when composers such as [[Henry Purcell]] and [[John Blow]] wrote elaborate examples for the [[Chapel Royal]] with orchestral accompaniment.  In the [[19th century]] [[Samuel Sebastian Wesley]] wrote anthems influenced by contemporary [[oratorio]] which could stretch to several [[movement (music)|movements]] and last twenty minutes or longer.  Later in the same century [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] composed examples which used symphonic techniques to produce a more concise and unified structure.  Many anthems have been produced on this model since his time, generally by [[organ (music)|organists]] rather than professional [[composer]]s and often in a conservative style.  Major composers have tended to compose anthems only in response to commissions and for special occasions; examples include [[Edward Elgar]]'s ''Great is the Lord'' and ''Give unto the Lord'' (both with orchestral accompaniment), [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''Rejoice in the Lamb'' (a modern example of a multi-movement anthem and today heard mainly as a concert piece) and (on a much smaller scale) [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' ''O taste and see'', written for the [[coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]].  With the relaxation of the rule, in [[England]] at least, that anthems should be only in English, the repertoire has been greatly enhanced by the addition of many works from the Latin repertory.

'''Albrecht Altdorfer''' (c. [[1480]] near [[Regensburg]] &amp;ndash; [[February 12]], [[1538]] in [[Regensburg]]) was a [[painter]], the leader of the [[Danubian School]] in southern [[Germany]], and a contemporary of [[Albrecht Dürer]].

He was a landscape painter of religious and mythological representations but most notably for painting landscapes for their beauty and not as illustrating any story or parable.  He was perhaps the first &quot;pure&quot; landscape painter.

His &quot;Battle of Arbela&quot; adorns the Munich Picture Gallery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Ascanian House''' is a dynasty of German rulers. One of its oldest known members was [[Otto, Count of Ballenstedt]], who died in [[1123]]. It is named after the City of [[Aschersleben]]. 

[[Albert the Bear]] was the first Ascanian Margrave of [[Brandenburg]]; he inherited the territory from its last [[Wends|Wendish]] ruler, [[Pribislav]], in [[1150]].

Albert, and his descendants of the Ascanian House, then made considerable progress in [[Christianity|Christianizing]] and [[Germany|Germanizing]] the lands. As a borderland between German and [[Slavs|Slavic]] cultures, the country was known as the [[Marches|March]] of Brandenburg at this time. In [[1320]] the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end.

'''Arthropods''' ([[Scientific classification|phylum]] '''Arthropoda''') ([[Greek language|Greek]] for ''jointed feet'') are the largest [[phylum]] of [[animal]]s and include the [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and others. Approximately eighty percent of extant (living today) animal species are arthropods, with over a million modern species described and a [[fossil record]] reaching back to the early [[Cambrian]]. Arthropods are common throughout marine, freshwater, terrestrial, and even aerial environments, as well as including various [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] and [[parasite|parasitic]] forms. They range in size from microscopic [[plankton]] (~0.25&amp;nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]]) up to forms several metres long.

Arthropods are characterised by the possession of a [[segment]]ed body with [[appendage]]s on each segment. They have a [[dorsal]] heart and a [[ventral]] nervous system. All arthropods are covered by a hard [[exoskeleton]] that is made out of [[chitin]], a [[polysaccharide]]. Periodically, an arthropod sheds this covering when it [[ecdysis|moults]]. This covering makes arthropods less prone to [[dehydration]].

== Basic arthropod structure ==
[[Image:Blue crab on market in Piraeus - Callinectes sapidus Rathbun 20020819-317.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Blue crab]], ''Callinectes sapidus'']]
The success of the arthropods is related to their hard '''[[exoskeleton]]''', segmentation, and jointed [[appendage]]s. The appendages are used for feeding, sensory reception, defense, and locomotion.

Most arthropods respire (breathe) through a [[trachea]]l system (exceptions are [[Pauropoda]], some [[thysanura]]ns and some [[arachnid]]s like many [[mite]]s); a potential difficulty considering that the skeletal structure is external and covers nearly all of the body. [[Aquatic]] arthropods use [[gills]] to exchange gases.  These gills have an extensive surface area in contact with the surrounding water. [[Landform|Terrestrial]] arthropods have internal surfaces that are specialised for gas exchange. Insects have tracheal systems: air sacs leading into the body from [[pore]]s, called [[spiracles]], in the epidermis [[cuticle]].

Arthropods have an [[Circulatory system#Open circulatory system|open circulatory system]]. [[Circulatory system#Open circulatory system|Haemolymph]], a [[copper]]-based [[blood]] analogue, is propelled by a series of hearts into the body cavity where it comes in direct contact with the tissues. Arthropods are [[protostome]]s. There is a [[body cavity| coelom]], but it is reduced to a tiny cavity around the reproductive and excretory organs, and the dominant body cavity is a hemocoel, filled with hemolymph which bathes the organs directly. The arthropod body is divided into a series of distinct segments, plus a presegmental ''acron'' which usually supports [[compound eyes | compound]] and simple eyes and a postsegmental ''[[telson]]''. These are grouped into distinct, specialised body regions called ''tagmata''. Each segment at least primitively supports a pair of [[appendage]]s.

The cuticle in arthropods forms a rigid exoskeleton, composed mainly of [[chitin]], which is periodically shed as the animal grows. They contain an inner zone (procuticle) which is made of protein and chitin (a polysaccharide) and is responsible for the strength of the exoskeleton. The outer zone (epicuticle) lies on the surface of the procuticle. It is nonchitinous and is a complex of [[proteins]] and [[lipids]]. It provides the moisture proofing and protection to the procuticle. The exoskeleton takes the form of plates called ''sclerites'' on the segments, plus rings on the appendages that divide them into segments separated by joints. This is in fact what gives arthropods their name&amp;mdash;joint feet&amp;mdash;and separates them from their very close relatives, the [[Onychophora]] and [[Tardigrada]], also called [[Lobopoda]] (and which is sometimes included in a group called [[Panarthropoda]], that also includes true arthropods). The skeletons of arthropods strengthen them against attack by predators and are impermeable to water. In order to grow, an arthropod must shed its old exoskeleton and secrete a new one. This process, [[moult]]ing, is expensive in terms of energy consumption, and during the moulting period, an arthropod is vulnerable.

==Classification of arthropods==
[[Image:Common_blue_damselfly02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Common Blue Damselfly]] (''Enallagama cyathigerum''), an insect]]
Arthropods are typically [[scientific classification|classified]] into five [[subphylum|subphyla]]:
# '''[[Trilobite]]s''' are a group of formerly numerous marine animals that died in the [[extinction event|mass extinction]] at the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|end of the Permian]].
# '''[[Chelicerata|Chelicerates]]''' include [[spider]]s, [[mite]]s, [[scorpion]]s and related organisms. They are characterised by the presence of [[chelicerae]].
# '''[[Myriapoda|Myriapods]]''' comprise [[millipede]]s and [[centipede]]s and their relatives and have many body segments, each bearing one or two pairs of legs. They are sometimes grouped with the hexapods.
# '''[[Hexapoda|Hexapods]]''' comprise [[insect]]s and three small orders of insect-like animals with six thoracic legs. They are sometimes grouped with the myriapods, in a group called [[Uniramia]].
# '''[[Crustacean]]s''' are primarily marine (a notable exception being [[woodlouse|woodlice]]) and are characterised by having [[biramous]] appendages. They include [[lobster]]s, [[crab]]s, [[barnacle]]s, and many others.

Aside from these major groups, there are also a number of fossil forms as [[Cambropodus]], [[Anomalocarida]] and [[Euthycarcinoidea]], mostly from the lower [[Cambrian]], which are difficult to place, either from lack of obvious affinity to any of the main groups or from clear affinity to several of them.

==Related groups==
[[Image:31-Velvet Worm.JPG|thumb|left|[[Velvet worm]], a member of the Onychophora]]
At one point, it was considered that the different subphyla of arthropods had separate origins from segmented worms, and in particular that the [[Uniramia]] were closer to the [[Onychophora]] than to other arthropods. However, this is rejected by most workers, and is contradicted by genetic studies.

Traditionally the [[Annelida]] have been considered the closest relatives of these three phyla, on account of their common segmentation. More recently, however, this has been considered convergent evolution, and the arthropods and allies may be more closely related to certain [[body cavity|pseudocoelomates]] such as [[roundworm]]s that share with them growth by moulting, or [[ecdysis]]. These two possible lineages have been termed the [[Articulata]] and [[Ecdysozoa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Acceleration.png|frame|Acceleration is the time rate of change of velocity, and at any point on a v-t graph, it is given by the slope of the tangent to that point]] In [[physics]], '''acceleration''' (symbol: ''a'') is defined as the rate of change (or [[derivative]] with respect to time) of [[velocity]]. It is thus a [[vector (spatial)|vector]] quantity with dimension [[length]]/[[time]]&amp;sup2;. In [[SI|SI units]], acceleration is measured in [[Metre per second|metres/second&amp;sup2;]].

== Explanation ==

To accelerate an object is to change its velocity in relation to time.   In this strict scientific sense, acceleration can have positive and negative values &amp;ndash; respectively called acceleration (velocity is increased) and '''deceleration''' (or retardation -- velocity is decreased) in common speech &amp;ndash; as well as change of direction. Acceleration is a vector defined by properties of magnitude (size or mesurablility) and direction. When either speed or direction are changed, there is a change in acceleration.  

Acceleration is defined technically as &quot;the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time&quot; and the instantaneous acceleration of an objection is given by the equation 
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{a} = {d\mathbf{v}\over dt}
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:'''a''' is the acceleration [[vector (spatial)|vector]] (as acceleration is a vector, it must be described with both a [[direction]] and a [[magnitude]].

:'''v''' is the velocity vector

:''t'' is time

:''d'' is [[Leibniz's notation for differentiation]]

When velocity is plotted against time on a [[velocity vs. time graph]], the acceleration is given by the slope, or the [[derivative]] of the graph.

If used with [[SI|SI]] standard units (metres per second for velocity; seconds for time) this equation gives '''a''' the units of m/(s·s), or m/s&amp;sup2; (read as &quot;metres per second per second&quot;, or &quot;metres per second squared&quot;).

An average acceleration, or acceleration over time, '''ā''' can be defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\bar{a}} = {\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{u} \over t}
&lt;/math&gt;

where 


:'''u''' is the initial velocity (m/s)

:'''v''' is the final velocity (m/s)

:''t'' is the time interval (s) elapsed between the two velocity measurements

[[Transverse]] acceleration ([[perpendicular]] to velocity) causes change in direction. If it is constant in magnitude and changing in direction with the velocity, we get  a [[circular motion]]. For this [[centripetal acceleration]] we have

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} = - \frac{v^2}{r} \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r} = - \omega^2 \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

One common unit of acceleration is ''[[gee|g]]'', one ''g'' being the acceleration caused by the [[gravity]] of [[Earth]] at [[sea]] level at 45° [[latitude]] (Paris), or about 9.81 m/s&amp;sup2;.

[[Jerk]] is the rate of change of an object's acceleration over time. 

In [[classical mechanics]], acceleration &lt;math&gt; a \ &lt;/math&gt; is related to [[Force (physics)|force]] &lt;math&gt;F \ &lt;/math&gt; and [[mass]] &lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt; (assumed to be constant) by way of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]: 
:&lt;math&gt;
F = m \cdot a
&lt;/math&gt;

As a result of its [[invariant (physics)|invariance]] under the [[Galilean_transformation|Galilean transformations]], acceleration is an absolute quantity in [[classical mechanics]].

== Relation to relativity ==

After defining his theory of [[special relativity]], [[Albert Einstein]] realized that forces felt by objects undergoing constant acceleration are indistinguishable from those in a gravitational field, and thus defined [[general relativity]] that also explained how gravity's effects could be limited by the speed of [[light]].

If you accelerate away from your friend, you could say (given your frame of reference) that it is your friend who is accelerating away from you, although only ''you'' feel any force. This is also the basis for the popular [[Twin paradox]], which asks why only one twin ages when moving away from his sibling at near light-speed and then returning, since the aging twin can say that it is the other twin that was moving. 
[[General relativity]] solved the &quot;why does only one object feel accelerated?&quot; problem which had plagued philosophers and scientists since Newton's time (and caused Newton to endorse absolute space). In ''special'' relativity, only [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frames of reference]] (non-accelerated frames) can be used and are equivalent; ''general'' relativity considers ''all'' frames, even accelerated ones, to be equivalent. With changing velocity, accelerated objects exist in warped space (as do those that reside in a gravitational field). Therefore, frames of reference must include a description of their local [[spacetime]] [[curvature]] to qualify as complete.

Acceleration can be measured using an [[Accelerometer|accelerometer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Conservation''' is the profession devoted to the preservation of cultural property for the future. Conservation activities include examination, documentation, treatment, and preventive care, supported by research and education. (Definition taken from the Core Documents of The American Institute for Conservation of Historic &amp; Artistic Works - see external links.)

Art restoration involves the cleaning, repairing, or reconstruction of art work. Ideally, any process used is reversible, departures from that ideal not being undertaken lightly. Commonly art restoration involves removing residue from [[sculpture]]s or [[painting]]s. Art restoration can sometimes be controversial due to fears that a restoration would damage a piece, or on the grounds that damage or [[residue]] forms part of the history of a given piece and should not be modified. The [[David|statue of David]] recently underwent restoration, to remove dirt that had accumulated on the statues surface.

In [[North America]], only four colleges/universities offer a major in art conservation:
* The [[University of Delaware]] (in association with [[Winterthur Museum]])
* [[Buffalo State College]], New York
* [[Queen's University, Kingston|Queen's University]], [[Ontario]]
* [[New York University]]

In addition, the [[Getty Museum]], in combination with [[UCLA]] is starting a program in Archeological Conservation, which is Art Conservation.

The opposite of art restoration is [[art destruction]].

'''Anton Pavlovich Chekhov''' (Анто́н Па́влович Че́хов) ([[29 January]] [[1860]] &amp;ndash; [[15 July]] [[1904]]) ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]: [[17 January]] [[1860]] &amp;ndash; [[2 July]] [[1904]]) was a major [[Russia]]n writer known primarily for his [[short story|short stories]] and [[play]]s. Many of his short stories are considered the [[apotheosis]] of the form while his plays, though few (although only four are considered major), have had a great impact on dramatic literature and performance.

Chekhov is better known in modern-day Russia for his several hundred short stories, many of which are considered masterpieces of the form.  Yet his plays are also major influences on twentieth-century drama.  From Chekhov, many contemporary playwrights have learned how to use mood, apparent trivialities and inaction to highlight the internal [[psychology]] of characters.  Chekhov's four major plays—''[[The Seagull]]'', ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'', ''[[The Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'', and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]''—are frequently revived in modern productions.

==Life==
===Early life===
Anton Chekhov was born in [[Taganrog]], a small provincial port on the [[Sea of Azov]], in southern [[Russian Empire|Russia]] on January 29, [[1860]]. A son of a [[grocer]] (his father had the official rank of ''Trader of the Third [[Guild]]'' - купeц 3й гильдии) and grandson to a [[serf]] who had bought his own freedom, Anton Chekhov was the third of six children. 

[[Image:Assumption_Cathedral.jpg|thumb|below|250px|The Assumption Cathedral in [[Taganrog]], [[Russia]], where Anton Chekhov was christened on February 10, 1860.]]

Anton attended a school for Greek boys in [[Taganrog]] ([[1866]]-[[1868]]), and at the age of eight he was sent to the Taganrog [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] for boys, where he proved an average pupil. Rather reserved and undemonstrative, he nevertheless gained a reputation for satirical comments, for pranks, and for making up humorous nicknames for his teachers. He enjoyed playing in amateur theatricals and often attended performances at the provincial theater. As an adolescent he tried his hand at writing short &quot;anecdotes&quot;, farcical or facetious stories, although he is also known to have written a serious long play at this time, &quot;Fatherless&quot;, which he later destroyed.

Anton Chekhov was in love with theater and literature from his childhood. The first performance that he attended was [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s operetta ''Elena the Beautiful'' onstage [[Taganrog Theatre|Taganrog City Theater]] on [[October 4]], [[1873]]. Anton was a thirteen years old Gymnasium student, and from that moment on, he became a great theater lover and spent there virtually all his savings. His favorite seat in the theater was at the back gallery for it was cheap (40 silver kopeeks), and because Gymnasium students needed a special authorisation to go to the theater. The permission was given not often and mostly for the weekends. Sometimes, Chekhov and other fellow students disguised themselves and even wore some makeup, spectacles or a fake beard, trying to fool the regular school staff who checked for unauthorized presence of students.

The writer's mother, Yevgeniya, was an excellent storyteller, and Chekhov is supposed to have acquired his own gift for narrative and to have learned to read and write from her. His father, Pavel Yegorovich Chekhov, a strict [[disciplinarian]] and a religious [[zealot]], demanded from all dedication to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the family business. In [[1875]], facing [[bankruptcy]], he was forced to escape from [[creditor]]s to [[Moscow]], where his two eldest sons were attending the university, and for the next several years the family lived in poverty.
[[Image:Chekhov house.jpg|thumb|250px|'''Chekhov Birthhouse''' in [[Taganrog]].]]

Anton stayed behind in [[Taganrog]] for three more years to finish school. He made ends meet by giving private tutoring, selling off household goods, and later, working in a clothing warehouse.  In [[1879]], Chekhov completed schooling at the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] and joined his family in Moscow, having gained admission to the medical school at [[Moscow State University]].

===Early writings===
In a bid to support his family, Chekhov started writing short, humorous sketches and vignettes of contemporary Russian life, many under [[pseudonym]]s such as Antosha Chekhonte (Антоша Чехонте), ''Man without the spleen'' (Человек без селезенки), and others.  His first published piece appeared in the [[St Petersburg]] weekly ''Strekoza'' (Стрекоза, &quot;Dragonfly&quot;) in March, [[1880]]. It is not known how many stories Chekhov wrote during this period, but his output was prodigious, and he rapidly earned a reputation as a satirical chronicler of Russian street life.

Nicolas Leykin, one of the leading publishers of the time and the owner of ''Oskolki'' (Осколки, &quot;Fragments&quot;), to which Chekhov began submitting some of his finer works, recognized the writer's talent but restricted the length of Chekhov's prose, limiting him only to sketches of a page and a half in length. Some believe that it was this limitation that developed Chekhov's trademark concise style.  

Chekhov qualified as a [[physician]] in [[1884]], but continued writing for weekly periodicals and in [[1885]] began submitting to the ''Peterburgskaya Gazeta'' (&quot;The Petersburg Gazette&quot;) longer works of a more somber nature; these were rejected by Leykin.  By December 1885 he was invited to write for one of the most respected papers of St Petersburg, ''Novoye vremya'' (Новое Время, &quot;New Times&quot;), owned and edited by the millionaire magnate Alexey Suvorin.  By [[1886]] Chekhov was becoming a well-known writer, but he still considered his writing a [[hobby]].

[[Dmitrii Grigorovich]], one of the many writers who were attracted to Chekhov's stories, persuaded him to take his talents seriously.  In an immensely fruitful year Chekhov wrote over a hundred stories and published his first collection &quot;Motley Tales&quot; {''Pestrye rasskazy'') with support from Suvorin, and in the following year the short story collection &quot;At Dusk&quot; (''V sumerkakh'') won Chekhov the coveted [[Pushkin Prize]].  This would mark the beginnings of a highly productive career for the writer.

=== Mature years ===
In the late [[1880s]], Chekhov contracted [[tuberculosis]] from his patient. In [[1887]], forced by overwork and ill health, Chekhov undertook a trip to eastern [[Ukraine]].  Upon his return, he started writing the long short story ''The Steppe'' (''Step''), which was eventually published in a serious literary journal ''Severny vestnik'' (&quot;Northern Herald&quot;).  This short story marked a new height for the writer, having the prestige to be published in a leading periodical of the time and showing the maturity that distinguished his later fiction.

[[Image:1900 yalta-gorky and chekhov.jpg|left|thumb|300px|With [[Maxim Gorky]] at [[Yalta]] in 1900.]]

The first production of &quot;The Seagull,&quot; which premiered October 17, 1896, in St. Petersburg, was disastrous for Chekhov. The opening night audience was expecting a comedy and the company had had only nine days to rehearse. Jeers and boos greeted Nina's monologue at the end of Act I. So distraught was Chekhov that he wrote &quot;I shall never forget last evening...I shall not have that play produced in Moscow, ever. NEVER again shall I write play or have them staged.&quot; (As luck would have it, audiences from the 2nd and 3rd nights were more appreciative; however, Chekhov ignored them.)

After the second production of ''The Seagull'' (and first successful one) by the [[Moscow Art Theatre]], in 1898, he wrote three more plays for the same company: ''Uncle Vanya'', ''The Three Sisters'' and ''The Cherry Orchard''. In [[1901]] he married [[Olga Leonardovna Knipper]] ([[1870]]-[[1959]]), an actress who performed in his plays.

The movement toward [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] in theatre that was sweeping Europe reached its highest artistic peak in Russia in 1898 with the formation of the Moscow Art Theatre (later, until recently, called МХАТ, the [[Moscow Academy Art Theatre]]). Its name became synonymous with that of Chekhov, whose plays about the day-to-day life of the [[landed gentry]] achieved a delicate poetic realism that was years ahead of its time. [[Konstantin Stanislavsky]], its director, became the [[20th century]]'s most influential theorist on acting.

Accompanied by Suvorin, Chekhov visited western [[Europe]]. Their long and close friendship negatively reflected on Chekhov's popularity, as Suvorin's ''Novoye vremya'' was considered politically reactionary in the increasingly liberal times. Eventually, Chekhov broke with Suvorin over the attitude taken by the paper toward the notorious [[Dreyfus Affair]] in [[France]], with Chekhov championing the cause of [[Alfred Dreyfus]].

His illness forced Chekhov to spend long periods of time in [[Nice]], [[France]] and later in [[Yalta]] in the [[Crimea]]. Chekhov died of complications of tuberculosis in [[Badenweiler]], [[Germany]] where he had been visiting a special clinic for treatment. He was buried in [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].

== Assessment ==
It can be safely said that Chekhov revolutionized the [[literary genre|genre]] of short story; his subject matter and technique influenced many future short-story writers.  It is often said that little action occurs in Chekhov's stories and plays, but he compensates for lack of outward excitement by his original techniques for developing internal drama. The point of a typical Chekhov story is most often what happens within a given character, and that is conveyed indirectly, by suggestion or by significant detail.  Chekhov eschews the traditional build-up of chronological detail, instead emphasizing moments of epiphanies and illumination over a significantly shorter period of time.  As such, his best stories have a psychological realism and concision seldom matched by other writers.  [[Tolstoy]] likened Chekhov's technique to that of the French [[Impressionists]], who daubed canvases with paint apparently without reason, but achieved an overall effect of vivid, unchallengeable artistry.  
[[Image:Grave of Anton Chekhov.jpg|thumb|Gravestone in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow.]]

One critic &lt;!-- name?? --&gt; says of Chekhov that he is no moralist &amp;mdash; he simply says &quot;you live badly, ladies and gentlemen,&quot; but his smile has the indulgence of a very wise man.

As samples of the Russian epistolary art, Chekhov's letters have been rated second only to [[Aleksandr Pushkin]]'s by the literary historian [[D.S. Mirsky]]. Although Chekhov is still chiefly known for his plays, critical opinion shows signs of establishing the stories, particularly those that were written after [[1888]], as an even more significant and creative literary achievement.

Equally innovative in his dramatic works, Chekhov sought to convey the texture of everyday life and move away from traditional ideas of plot and conventions of dramatic speech.  Dialogue in his plays is not smooth or continuous: characters interrupt each other, several different conversations take place at the same time, and lengthy pauses occur when no one speaks at all.  A recurring theme is the pointlessness of radical, human or mechanical change, versus the powerful inertia of slow organic cycles.

&lt;!-- consider moving this para into Quotes, after finding the name of...
One of the actors once told Chekhov that Stanislavsky intended to have frogs croaking, the sound of dragonflies, and dogs barking on the stage. &quot;Why?&quot; Chekhov asked with a note of dissatisfaction in his voice. &quot;It is realistic,&quot; the actor replied. &quot;Realistic,&quot; Chekhov repeated with a laugh, and after a slight pause he said: &quot;The stage is art. There is a canvas of Kranskoi (a famous Russian painter) in which he wonderfully depicts human faces and substituted a real one. The nose will be realistic but the picture will be spoiled.&quot; --&gt;
Perhaps one of his best known contributions is ''[[Chekhov's dictum]]'' (also known as ''Chekhov's Gun''): ''If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there.''

==Influence==
[[Image:Anton Tschechow Denkmal.JPG|thumb|150px|left|A bust of Chekov in Badenweiler, Germany, where he died.]]
Although contemporary [[Russia]]n literary critics celebrated Chekhov, international fame came only after [[World War I]] with [[Constance Garnett]]'s [[English language|English]] translations.

Chekhov's plays were immensely popular in [[England]] in the [[1920s]] and have become classics of the [[United Kingdom|British]] stage. In the [[United States]] his fame came somewhat later, through the influence of Stanislavsky's technique for achieving realistic acting. American [[playwright]]s such as [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Arthur Miller]], and [[Clifford Odets]] have used Chekhovian techniques, and few important writers of plays in the 20th century can have escaped Chekhov's influence entirely: for example, the work by British playwright [[Michael Frayn]] is often compared to that of Chekhov for its focus on humorous family situations and its insights into society.

Many writers of prose, particularly of short stories, have also been influenced by Chekhov, such as [[Katherine Mansfield]]. [[John Cheever]] has been called &quot;the Chekhov of the suburbs&quot; for his ability to capture the drama and sadness of the lives of his characters by revealing the undercurrents of apparently insignificant events.  American writer [[Raymond Carver]] was also frequently compared to Chekhov, because of his minimalistic prose style, and tendency to meditate upon the humor and tragedy in the everyday lives of working class people. 
Master of the short story, the British author [[Victor Sawdon Pritchett]]'s short stories are prized for their craftsmanship and comic irony similar to that of Chekhov.

The continuously growing list of films and theater productions based on Chekhov's stories and plays includes [[Emil Loteanu]]'s ''My Tender and Affectionate Beast'' (1978, see {{imdb title|id=0172812|title=Мой ласковый и нежный зверь}}), [[Nikita Mikhalkov]] and [[Marcello Mastroianni]]'s ''Dark Eyes'' (1987), [[Louis Malle]]'s ''Vanya on 42nd Street'' (1994), [[Anthony Hopkins]]'s ''August'' (1996), [[Lanford Wilson]]'s ''The Three Sisters'' (1997), among many others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Apoptosis-blank.png|thumb|right|200px|Apoptosis]]
In [[biology]], '''apoptosis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''apo'' = from and ''ptosis'' = falling, commonly pronounced ''ap-a-tow'-sis''&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.nih.gov/sigs/aig/Aboutapo.html]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;) is one of the main types of [[programmed cell death]] (PCD). As such, it is a process of deliberate life relinquishment by an unwanted [[Cell (biology)|cell]] in a multicellular [[organism]]. In contrast to [[necrosis]], which is a form of cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis is carried out in an ordered process that generally confers advantages during an organism's life cycle. For example, the differentiation of [[human]] [[finger]]s  in a developing [[embryo]] requires the cells between the fingers to initiate apoptosis so that the fingers can separate. The way the apoptotic process is executed facilitates the safe disposal of cell corpses and fragments.

Since the beginning of the [[1990s]], research on apoptosis has grown spectacularly. In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon, defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in an extensive variety of diseases. ''Too much'' apoptosis causes cell-loss disorders, whereas ''too little'' results in uncontrolled cell proliferation, namely [[cancer]]ous [[tumor]]s.

Not all forms of PCD share the characteristic shapes (the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]) and sequences of apoptosis, but all types of PCD are highly-regulated processes.

== Functions of apoptosis ==

=== Cell damage or infection ===
Apoptosis can occur, for instance, when a cell is damaged beyond repair, or infected with a [[virus (biology)|virus]]. The &quot;decision&quot; for apoptosis can come from the cell itself, from its surrounding tissue or from a cell that is part of the [[immune system]].

If a cell's capability of apoptosis is damaged (for example, by [[mutation]]), or if the initiation of apoptosis is blocked (by a virus), a damaged cell can continue dividing without restrictions, developing into [[cancer]]. For example, as part of the hijacking of the cell's genetic system carried out by [[human papillomavirus]]es (HPV), a gene called ''E6'' is expressed in a product that degrades [[p53 gene|p53]] protein, which is a vital piece of the apoptotic pathway. This severe interference in the apoptotic capability of cells plays a critical role in the fact that persistent infection by oncogenic HPVs can result in the development of [[cervical cancer]].

=== Response to stress or DNA damage ===
Stress conditions (such as starvation) as well as damage to the cell's DNA resulting from toxicity or exposure to ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, such as γ- or X-rays, can induce a cell to begin an apoptotic process. A fascinating example, resulting from damage to the genome in the cell nucleus, is apoptosis triggered by the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, or PARP-1. This enzyme plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic integrity, and massive activation of PARP-1 can deplete the cell of energy-providing molecules, an event that sends signals from the nucleus for the mitochondria to start the Apoptotic process.

=== Homeostasis ===
In the adult organism, the number of cells within an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] or tissue has to be constant within a certain range. Blood and skin cells, for instance, are constantly renewed by their respective progenitor cells; but proliferation has to be compensated by cell death. This balancing process is part of the ''[[homeostasis]]'' required by living organisms to maintain their internal states within certain limits. Some authors and researchers like Steven Rose and [[Antonio Damasio]] have suggested ''homeodynamics'' as a more accurate and eloquent term ([[Apoptosis#References|Damasio 1999]], p. 141).

From 50 billion to 70 billion cells die each day due to apoptosis in the average human adult. In a year, this amounts to the proliferation and subsequent destruction of a mass of cells equal to an individual's body weight.

Homeostasis is achieved when the rate of [[mitosis]] (cell proliferation) in the tissue is balanced by cell death. If this equilibrium is disturbed, either of two things happen:
* The cells are dividing faster than they die, effectively developing a [[tumor]].
* The cells are dividing slower than they die, which results in a disorder of cell loss.
Both states can be fatal or highly damaging.

For instance, misregulation of Hedgehog (Hgg) protein signalling (see [[Apoptosis#Development|Development]], below) has been implicated in several forms of cancer. Hgg, which conveys an anti-apoptotic signal, has been found to be overexpressed in [[pancreas|pancreatic]] adenocarcinoma tissues.

=== Development ===
Programmed cell death is an integral part of both plant and [[metazoa]]n (multicellular animals) [[biological tissue|tissue]] [[developmental biology|development]]. It does not resemble the sort of reaction that comes as a result of tissue damage due to accident or [[pathogen]]ic infection (cell death by [[necrosis]]). Instead of swelling and bursting - hence spilling their possibly damaging internal contents into extracellular space - apoptotic cells and their [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] shrink, and often fragment. In this way, they can be efficiently [[phagocytose]]d (and, as a consequence of this, their components reused) by [[macrophage]]s or by neighboring cells.

Research on chick embryos - specifically on chick [[neural tube]] development - has suggested how selective cell proliferation, combined with selective apoptosis, sculpts developing tissues in vertebrates. During vertebrate embryo development, structures called the [[notochord]] and the floor plate secrete a gradient of the signaling molecule [[Sonic hedgehog]] (Shh), and it is this gradient that directs cells to form patterns in the embryonic neural tube: Cells that receive Shh in a receptor in their membranes called Patched1 (Ptc1) survive and proliferate; but, in the absence of Shh, one of the ends of this same Ptc1 receptor (the carboxyl-terminal, inside the membrane) is cleaved by caspase-3, an action that exposes an apoptosis-producing domain (see the Perspective by Isabel Guerrero and Ariel Ruiz i Altaba [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12907783] and the research report by Chantal Thibert ''et
al.''[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12907805]).

Research like the one carried out by Thibert and her colleagues has begun to clarify some of the fundamental aspects of [[morphogenesis]], or the development of organisms from fertilized eggs to fully-developed animals and plants. It has also suggested specific answers to why normal cells carry out apoptosis when they end up outside the places they should be in body tissues.

=== Immune cell regulation ===
[[B cell]]s and [[T cell]]s are sophisticated &amp;ndash;and very effective&amp;ndash; front-line players in the body's defenses against infectious agents, as well as against local cells that have acquired or developed a malignancy. In order to carry out their job, B and T cells must have the ability to discriminate &quot;self&quot; from &quot;nonself,&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; from &quot;unhealthy,&quot; [[antigen]]s (protein segments that make a good fit, like a key and a lock, with specialized receptors in B and T cell membranes). For instance, &quot;killer&quot; T cells can be activated when presented with fragments of inappropriately-expressed proteins (resulting, say, from a malignant mutation) or with foreign antigens produced as a consequence of a viral infection. After becoming activated, they migrate out of the lymph nodes in which they reside, proliferate, recognize the affected cells and commit them to programmed cell death.

The receptors in immature B and T cell membranes are not tailored precisely to coincide with &quot;known&quot; antigens. Rather, they are generated through a highly-variable process that results in an immense variety, capable of making a good fit with an astounding number of precise molecular shapes. This means that most of these immature cells can be either ineffective (because the almost random shapes of their receptors do not engage any antigen of significance) or dangerous to their own organism, because their receptors could make a good molecular fit with healthy self antigens. If they were to be let loose without any further processing, many could become ''autoreactive'' and attack healthy body cells. The way the immune system regulates this process is by &quot;deleting&quot; both the ineffective and the potentially damaging immature cells via apoptosis.

As has just been described in the previous section on development, all tissue in multicellular animals depends on continuous receipt of survival signals. In the case of T cells, as they develop and mature in the thymus, the survival signal depends on their capability to engage foreign antigens. Those that fail in this test, amounting to about 97% of the freshly-produced T cells, are committed to programmed cell death. The survivors are tested as well for potentially damaging autoimmune reactions, and those that show high affinity to healthy self antigens are killed via apoptosis.

Be aware that such a portrayal presents a highly-simplified picture: The actual process in which B and T cells are driven to proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis comprises a complex interplay between positive and negative regulators.

== Apoptotic process ==

=== Morphology ===
A cell undergoing apoptosis shows a characteristic morphology that can be seen under a [[microscope]]:

# The cell becomes round (circular). This occurs because the protein structures that conform the cytoskeleton are digested by specialized  [[peptidase]]s (called ''[[caspase]]s'') that have been activated inside the cell.
# [[Chromatin]] ([[DNA]] and its packaging [[protein]]s in the [[cell nucleus]]) undergoes initial degradation and condensation (see the article by Madeleine Kihlmark ''et al.'', in   [http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/114/20/3643]).
# Chromatin undergoes further condensation into compact patches against the [[nuclear envelope]]. At this stage, the double membrane that surrounds the nucleus still appears complete; however, as observed by Kihlmark and colleagues, specialized caspases have already advanced in the degradation of nuclear pore proteins and have begun to degrade the [[lamin]] that underlies the nuclear envelope. It must be noted, also, that, while the previous stage of initial chromatin condensation has been observed in nonapoptotic forms of programmed cell death, this advanced stage (called [[pyknosis]]) is considered a hallmark of apoptosis. [http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/abstract/192/4/571]
# The nuclear envelope becomes discontinuous and the DNA inside it is fragmented (a process referred to as [[karyorrhexis]]). The nucleus breaks into several discrete ''[[chromatin]] bodies'' or ''nucleosomal units'' due to the degradation of DNA [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=10739646].
# [[Plasma membrane]] blebbings.
# The cell is [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]], ''or''
# The cell breaks apart into several [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s called ''apoptotic bodies'', which are then phagocytosed.

=== Biochemical signals for safe disposal ===
The dying cells described, undergoing the final stages of apoptosis, display &quot;eat me&quot; signals, like phosphatidylserine (PS). Phosphatidylserine is normally found on the cytosolic (inner) surface of the plasma membrane, but is redistributed to the extracellular surface during apoptosis. Phagocytic scavengers, such as macrophages, have specialized receptors that recognize PS and carry out their disposal job in an orderly manner without eliciting an inflammatory response  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14645835], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14645848].

In studies on mouse embryos lacking PS receptors conducted by Ming O. Li and colleagues [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14645847], un-ingested cells undergoing apoptosis accumulated in the brain and lungs, leading to neonatal lethality. However, another group that deleted the same gene found no abnormality in cell death, so developing the question whether this gene really does encode the PS receptor, rather than a nuclear localized transcription factor [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15345036&amp;query_hl=22].

In another study [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15155946], milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) was found to bind to phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells and help [[macrophage]]s to engulf such cells.
Tingible body [[macrophage]]s highly express MFG-E8 on their plasma membranes.
Mice lacking MFG-E8 exhibited a decrease in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, leading to an extreme increase in the production of IgG [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]].

=== Intrinsic and extrinsic inducers ===
Apoptotic messages from outside the cell (called ''extrinsic'' inducers) will be described in the next section, on biochemical execution of apoptosis.

Apoptotic messages from inside the cell (''intrinsic'' inducers) are a response to stress, such as nutrient deprivation or DNA damage, as explained by Chiarugi and Moskowitz in their previously-mentioned article on PARP-1.

Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways have in common the activation of ''central effectors of apoptosis'', a group of cysteine proteases called ''[[caspase|caspases]]'', which carry out the cleaving of both structural and functional elements of the cell, resulting in the previously-described morphological changes.

=== Biochemical execution ===
Caspases are normally suppressed by [[inhibitor of apoptosis protein|IAP]] (inhibitor of apoptosis) proteins [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11711663]. When a cell receives an apoptotic stimulus, IAP activity is relieved after SMAC (Second Mitochondria-derived Activator of Caspases, or its mouse homologue, called DIABLO), a [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] protein, is released into the [[cytosol]]. SMAC binds to IAPs, and in doing so &quot;inhibits the inhibitors,&quot; effectively preventing them from arresting the apoptotic process.

But, before we go on to a short description of how SMAC is released, we must take a look at two much-studied extrinsically-induced apoptotic processes: the TNF and the Fas pathways. Keep in mind, however, that both activating and inhibiting factors are present at each step of these pathways.

Tumor necrosis factor ([[TNF]]), a 157-amino acid intercellular signaling molecule ([[cytokine]]), is produced mainly by activated macrophages, and is the major extrinsic mediator of apoptosis. The cell membrane has two specialized receptors for TNF: TNF-R1 and TNF-R2. The binding of TNF to TNF-R1 has been shown to fire-off the pathway that leads to activating the caspases [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12040173].

Fas (''a.k.a.'' Apo-1 or CD95), is another receptor of extrinsic apoptotic signals in the cell membrane, and belongs to the TNF receptor superfamily [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12040174]. The Fas ligand (FasL, the protein that binds to Fas and activates the Fas pathway) is a transmembrane protein, and is part of the TNF family. The interaction between Fas and FasL results in the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which contains the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and caspases 8 and 10. In some types of cells (type I), processed caspase-8 directly activates other members of the caspase family, and triggers the execution of apoptosis; whereas, in other types of cells (type II), the Fas DISC starts a feed-back loop that spirals into increasing release of pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria (see below), and the amplified activation of caspase-8.

Downstream from TNF-R1 and Fas activation - at least in mammalian cells - a balance between pro- (like BAX, BID, or BAD) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-Xl and Bcl-2) members of the [[Bcl-2|Bcl-2 family]] is compromised. This balance is the proportion of pro-apoptotic [[homodimer]]s that form in the outer-membrane of the mitochondrion. The homodimers (of molecules like BAK and BAX) are required in order to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable for the release of caspase activators. Just how BAX and BAK are controlled under the normal conditions of cells that are not undergoing apoptosis is incompletely understood. But it has been found that a mitochondrial outer-membrane protein, VDAC2, interacts with BAK to keep this potentially-lethal apoptotic effector under control. When the death signal is received, products of the activation cascade - such as tBID, BIM or BAD - displace VDAC2: BAK and BAX are activated, and the mitochondrial outer-membrane becomes permeable; it is seen that these members of the Bcl-2
family have a pore-forming domain, resulting in the release of caspase activators, namely [[cytochrome c]] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=10713725], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12881569]., but other molecules like SMAC or AIF are also released.

Once [[cytochrome c]] is released, it binds with Apaf-1 and [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], which then binds to pro-caspase-9, creating a multi-protein complex known as apoptosome. The apoptosome cleaves this pro-caspase, rendering the active form of caspase-9, which in turn activates effector caspase-3. (''See also the articles on [[caspase]]s and the [[Bcl-2|Bcl-2 protein family]]'').

The whole process requires energy and a cell machinery not too damaged. If the cell damage is between certain levels, the cell can start the earliest events of apoptosis and then continue with a necrosis.

It must be advised, however, that the apoptotic pathways that have been summarily described are subject to regulatory mechanisms, and that there is not a one-to-one relationship between the reception of TNF or FasL and the complete execution of an apoptotic pathway. Fas, for instance, has been implicated - in a seemingly ironic way - in cell proliferation, through pathways that are not yet well understood; and both Fas and TNF-R1 trigger events that activate the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-&amp;#954;B), which induces the expression of genes that play an important role in diverse biological processes, including cell growth, cell death, cell development, and immune responses.

The link between TNF and apoptosis shows why an abnormal production of TNF plays a fundamental role in several human diseases, especially (but not only) in autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis.

== Implication and role of apoptosis in diverse pathologies ==

===Apoptosis and HIV progression===
In the review article by [http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.19110-0 Alimonti ''et al'' (2004)], they describe how HIV-1 causes apoptosis in bystander CD4+ T cells leading to AIDS.

=== Apoptosis and the role of interferon in tumor suppression ===
In their ''Nature'' article on the &quot;Integration of interferon-alpha/beta signaling to p53 responses...&quot; (see previous section on [[Apoptosis#Cell damage or infection|Cell damage or infection]]), Takaoka and co-workers have described their research on how [[interferon]]-alpha and -beta (IFN-alpha/beta) induce transcription of the ''[[p53 gene]]'', resulting in the increase of p53 protein level and enhancement of cancer cell-apoptosis. p53 Is a tumor suppressor, and is considered as a negative-growth and anti-oncogenic factor.

Work carried out by Takaoka and colleagues has contributed to clarify the role played by interferon in the treatment of some forms of human cancer, and has provided knowledge on the link between p53 and IFN-alpha/-beta. The p53 response not only contributes to tumor suppression but is also important in eliciting an apoptotic response to viral infection and consequent damage to the cell's reproductive cycle.

=== Cancer and defective apoptotic pathways ===
Liling Yang ''et al.'' reported in the [[15 February]] [[2003]], issue of ''Cancer Research'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12591734] the results of their work in the role played by a defective death signal in a type of lung cancer cells called NCI-H460 (human non-small cell lung cancer cells). They found that the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is overexpressed in H460 cells. XIAPs bind to the processed form of caspase-9, and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator [[cytochrome c]] (see previous section on biochemical execution).

The apoptotic pathway was found to be dramatically restored in H460 cells with a Smac peptide (SmacN7) that targets IAPs. Yang and her team successfully developed a SmacN7 peptide that selectively reversed apoptosis resistance - and hence tumor growth - in H460 cells in mice.

(See also the role of [[Gefitinib]] and [[Peptidomimetic|peptidomimetics]] in restoring apoptotic pathways.)

=== Role of apoptotic products in tumor immunity ===
An interesting case of re-use and feed-back of apoptotic products was presented by Matthew L. Albert in a research article that won him an Amersham Biosciences &amp; Science Prize for Young Scientists in Molecular Biology, and published in ''Science Online'' in December, 2001. Albert described how dendritic Cells, a type of antigen-presenting cells, phagocytose (that is, engulf) apoptotic tumor cells. Upon maturation, these dendritic cells present antigen (derived from the apoptotic corpses) to killer T cells, which are then primed for the eradication of cells undergoing malignant transformation. This apoptosis-dependent pathway for T cell activation is not present during necrosis, and has opened exciting possibilities in tumor immunity research.

== Laboratory assays for apoptosis ==
The gold standard for detecting apoptosis in progress is still direct inspection for pyknotic bodies under [[microscope|light microscope]] or [[electron microscope]].  Less rigorous assays include:
* [[TUNEL assay]], in which broken DNA ends are labeled preferentially.  Note, however, that this will also detect less-orderly cell death such as [[necrosis]].
* [[Caspase]] assay, in which caspase cleavage of a marker protein allows detection.

== History and highlights in apoptosis research ==

A timeline of apoptosis research can be found in
Cell Death and Differentiation (2002) 9:349-54.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11965486&amp;query_hl=2]

===Early research, and the &quot;worm people&quot; at Cambridge===

[[Sydney Brenner]]'s studies on animal development began in the late-[[1950s]] in what was to become the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] (LMB) in [[Cambridge]], UK. It was at this lab that during the 1970s and 1980s, a team led by [[John Sulston]] succeeded in tracing the [[nematode]] ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans | C. elegan's]]'' entire embryonic cell lineage. In other words, Sulston and his team had traced where each and every cell in the roundworm's embryo came from during the division process, and where it ended up.

[[H. Robert Horvitz]] arrived from the US at the LMB in 1974, where he collaborated with Sulston. Both would share the 2002 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with Brenner, and Horvitz would go back to the US in 1978 to establish his own lab at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

Brenner's original interests were centered in [[genetics]] and in the development of the nervous system, but cell lineage and differentiation inevitably led to the study of cell fate: &quot;One aspect of the cell lineage particularly caught my attention: in addition to the 959 cells generated during worm development and found in the adult, another 131 cells are generated but are not present in the adult. These cells are absent because they undergo programmed cell death,&quot; as Horvitz narrated in his Nobel Lecture &quot;Worms, Life and Death,&quot; delivered on [[8 December]]. 2002 [http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/2002/horvitz-lecture.html].

''Programmed cell death'' had been known long before &quot;the worm people&quot; began to publish their celebrated findings. In 1964 Richard A. Lockshin and Carroll Williams published their contribution on &quot;Endocrine potentiation of the breakdown of the intersegmental muscles of silkmoths&quot; in the ''Journal of insect physiology'' (10 p. 643), where they used the concept of  &quot;programmed cell death,&quot; during a time when not much research was being carried out on this topic. John W. Saunders, Jr., stated the following in his 1966 contribution titled &quot;Death in Embryonic Systems&quot;: &quot;abundant death, often cataclysmic in its onslaught, is part of early development in many animals; it is the usual method of eliminating organs and tissues that is useful only during embryonic or larval life...&quot; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=5332319]. A little further on, this author lamented that too little had been done to analyze the significance of this process. Saunders, it should
be noted, recognized that he was building on earlier work by A. Glücksmann, and others.

Saunders and Lockshin reciprocally acknowledged that they benefitted from each other's work, and both pointed out the possibility that cell death might be regulated. Their observations helped to lead later work toward the genetic pathways of programmed cell death.

===Coining of the term ''apoptosis''===
In a signal article published in 1972, John F. Kerr, Andrew H. Wyllie and A. R. Currie, coined the term &quot;apoptosis&quot; in order to differentiate naturally-occurring developmental cell death, from the [[necrosis]] that results from acute tissue injury [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=4561027]. They also noted that the structural changes characteristic of apoptosis (see the section on Morphology, above) were present in cells that died in order to maintain an equilibrium between cell proliferation and death in a particular tissue (see [[Apoptosis#Homeostasis | Homeostasis]], above).

===1988===
Landmark research by David L. Vaux and colleagues described the anti-apoptotic and tumorigenic (tumor-causing) role of the human cancer gene ''bcl-2''  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=3262202]. Researchers had been hot in the track of [[oncogene]]s (genes that played a prominent role in causing cancer), and now more and more of the pieces were falling into place. However, although ''[[bcl-2]]'' was the first component of the cell death mechanism to be cloned in any organism, identification of other components of the vertebrate mechanism had to await the linking of apoptosis (in vertebrate systems) with the mechanism for programmed cell death in the worm.

===1990s and later===
In 1991, Ron Ellis, Junying Yuan and Horvitz released a rounded and up-to-date account of research on programmed cell death in their &quot;Mechanisms and Functions of Cell Death&quot; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=1809356]. Among other important work at Horvitz's laboratory, graduate students Hilary Ellis and Chand Desai had made the first discovery of genes that encode apoptosis-inducing proteins: ''ced-3'' and ''ced-4''.


Ron Ellis also identified a gene with an opposite effect: ''ced-9''. The product of this gene, CED-9, protects cells from programmed cell death, so its expression (or lack of) conveys a life-or-death decision on individual cells. In December 1992, David Vaux and Stuart Kim showed that human Bcl-2 could inhibit programmed cell death in the worm, thus linking PCD and apoptosis, revealing them to be the same, evolutionarily conserved process[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=1470921&amp;query_hl=14].

In 1994, Michael Hengartner published a paper showing that ''ced-9'' had similar sequence to ''[[bcl-2]]'' (which is not, actually, a single gene but a whole family of mammalian genes).

Horvitz would recount in his Nobel Lecture: &quot;I believe that the fact that Bcl-2 proved to look like a worm protein that antagonized programmed cell death helped convince researchers that the function of Bcl-2 was to antagonize the cell death process. I also believe that this similarity made the worm cell-death pathway suddenly a topic of major interest in the biomedical community, as this pathway was no longer simply an abstract formalism derived from complicated genetic studies of a microscopic soil-dwelling roundworm but rather a framework for a process fundamental to human biology and human disease.&quot;

In 1992, two independent teams working at pharmaceutical companies had identified and purified interleukin-1-beta-converting enzyme (ICE) in human cells, and succeeded in cloning the DNA sequence of this cysteine protease [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=1574116], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=1373520]. The following year, graduate students Shai Shaham and Junying Yuan working in Horvitz's laboratory identified ICE as the mammalian counterpart of CED-3 (that is, the product of the ''ced-3'' gene in ''C. elegans'').[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8242740&amp;query_hl=4]

In 1997, a protein similar to CED-4 was identified, in the laboratory of Xiaodong Wang (Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas), which they called Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor). The team published their results in an article entitled &quot;Apaf-1, a human protein homologous to C. elegans CED-4, participates in cytochrome c-dependent activation of caspase-3&quot; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=9267021].

Wang and his team identified and reconstituted the mitochondrial pathway to apoptosis (see Biochemical execution, above). Their published results illuminated whole new avenues of research on inflammatory diseases, cancer, and apoptosis, in general.

By 1998, research on the topic had already increased, as attested in the editorial &quot;Cell Death in Us and Others,&quot; written by an important contributor to apoptosis research, Pierre Golstein, in the [[28 August]]. 1998 issue of ''Science'': &quot;Although there have been scattered reports on the topic of cell death for more than a century, the 20,000 publications on this topic within the past 5 years reflect a shift from historically-mild interest to contemporary fascination.&quot; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=9735040]

Kerr, Wyllie, and Currie, who coined the term apoptosis (''falling leaves'' in Greek), meant, among other features, to remark on the de-adhesiveness of apoptotic cells from their natural surroundings, following programmed cell death. [[Anoikis]] (''homeless'' in Greek) is chronologically an inverse process: de-adhesiveness of viable cells from their surroundings inducing programmed cell death. Integrins are essential adhesive molecules in this process, but additional factors probably play a role. Beyond the physiological importance, understanding these patterns will be relevant to maintaining the vitality of cells used for cell therapy. Abnormal apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells is a fundamental factor in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases including cancer, neuro-degenerative and ischemic diseases, AIDS, and autoimmunity. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the antigen responsible for most anti-DNA antibodies, exclusively generated in this disease, are derived from nucleosomes. As nucleosomes
are mainly generated during programmed cell death, excess of apoptotic material and altered clearance may induce autoreactive immune responses. On the other side of the spectrum, failure to die, as exemplified in MRL/1pr mice and human lymphoproliferative disorder, may allow persistence of autoreactive cells and prevent the resolution of inflammation. When combined, we may conclude that dying properly is essential for living properly.

== Etymology ==
Kerr, Wyllie and Currie (see [[Apoptosis#Coining_of_the_term_apoptosis | Coining of the term apoptosis]], above) adopted the Greek word for the process of leaves falling from trees or petals falling from flowers ([[Apoptosis#References|Gilbert 2003, p. 164]]).

'''Anal sex''' or '''anal intercourse''' is a commonly practiced form of [[human sexual behaviour]] in some cultures. It involves the [[anus]] and possibly the [[rectum]], especially, but not limited to, the [[sexual penetration|insertion]] of the erect [[penis]] into the rectum through the anus. 

The use of [[sex toy]]s and other activities involving the anus and rectum may be considered anal sex as well. Anal sex can be pleasurable for both the insertive partner and the receptive partner, as the anus contains many of the same kinds of [[nerves]] as the penis or [[clitoris]].

For women, pleasure is derived from anal intercourse because the rectum shares a wall with the vagina and therefore shares some of the nerve endings associated with sexual pleasure.  The anus itself also contains a number of nerves which can react pleasurably when excited.  

For males, the tightness of the anus is often said to be a source of pleasure for the &quot;active&quot; partner in penetrative anal sex, while the presence of the [[prostate]] gland near the rectal wall is a source of pleasure during receptive anal intercourse. A sexual climax for the recipient (referred to colloquially as an [[anal orgasm]]) can occur through anal sex.

Many people view anal sex with disgust because of the relationship between the anus and feces. However, it is not uncommon for the rectum to be relatively vacant most of the time, the feces entering only just before defecation. Some fecal matter might still remain in the rectum between movements (albeit in minimal quantity); thus some couples use enemas - either [[enema|wet]] or [[dry enema|dry]], followed by shower or [[bidet]] use - for cleansing before engaging in any anal activity.

==Overview==
The term [[sodomy]] is imprecise, but is often used as a synonym for anal sex, particularly in older works. However, it often also refers to various other sexual activities. For instance, depending upon the [[jurisdiction]], the legal definition of sodomy may include any non-[[sexual intercourse|coitus]] act, including [[oral sex]] and [[zoophilia]].

Anal sex has been [[taboo]] in many Western countries since the [[Middle Ages]], when [[heresy|heretical]] movements were sometimes slandered by rumours that their members practiced anal sex among themselves. At that time the mainstream [[Christianity|Christian]] [[clergy]] was not celibate, but the highest orders of some heretical sects were, leading to rumours that their celibacy was a sign of their attraction to members of the same sex.  The term ''buggery'' originated in [[medieval]] [[Europe]] as an insult used to describe the rumoured same-sex sexual practices of the heretics from the ''Buggre'' sect. This sect originated in medieval [[Bulgaria]], where its followers were called ''[[bogomil]]s'', but when they spread out of the country they were called ''buggres'' (from the ethnonym ''Bulgars'').

Some medieval European woodcuts portray persons [[kiss]]ing the anus of a goat-like figure representing the Christian [[Devil]].  

As recently as 2003, several jurisdictions in the [[United States]] had laws making anal sex and other forms of [[sodomy]] a crime. Many of these statutes purported to prohibit anal sex by same-sex partners.  In 2003, [[John Geddes Lawrence|John Lawrence]] and Tyron Garner brought a landmark suit that challenged as unconstitutional [[Texas]]'s anti-sodomy law before the [[United States Supreme Court]]. Lawrence and Garner had previously been apprehended in Lawrence's home in the act of anal sex, after a neighbour had made a false noise complaint to the local police. The Supreme Court struck down the Texas law by a 6&amp;ndash;3 vote. Five of the justices joined the deciding opinion, which overturned the Court's previous ruling on sodomy in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]''. The Court reached the conclusion that the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibited the state from regulating private behaviours between adults without furthering a legitimate state interest. The governmental interest behind the law, moral objection to homosexuality, was held to not be a legitimate interest. (See ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.)

Although it is also practiced by [[heterosexual]]s and [[bisexuality|bisexuals]], anal sex is often associated with [[homosexuality|homosexual]] men. However, like persons of other [[sexual orientation]]s, some [[gay]] and [[bisexuality|bi]] men enjoy sexual activities of this kind while others do not.

The [[vagina]] normally produces its own [[lubrication]] during sex; the [[rectum]] does not, so a store-bought [[personal lubricant]] is recommended by most [[sexologist]]s for an enjoyable anal sex experience. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[World Health Organization]], unprotected anal sex carries more risk of [[sexually transmitted infection|STI]] transmission than [[vaginal sex|vaginal]] or [[oral sex|oral]] sex.  To reduce the risk of transmitting STIs such as [[HIV]], people are recommended to use a latex [[condom]] for all sexual contact which could result in transfer of [[body fluid|bodily fluids]], including anal sex.

==Anal sex among heterosexuals==
[[Edward O. Laumann]]'s ''The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States'' found that about 20% of heterosexuals have engaged in anal sex, and sex researcher [[Alfred Kinsey]] found that number to be closer to 40%.  More recently, a researcher from the [[University of British Columbia]] (quoted in the [[May 5]] [[2005]] issue of ''[[The Georgia Straight]]'') puts the number of heterosexuals who regularly practice anal sex at between 30% and 50%.

In several cultures (such as the [[Mediterranean]] area, [[Middle East]] and [[Latin America]]) female receptive anal intercourse in a heterosexual context is widely accepted, especially as there is less risk of unwanted [[human pregnancy|pregnancy]] via unprotected anal than unprotected vaginal intercourse.  Anal sex is sometimes seen as preserving female [[virginity]] (or at least preserving an intact [[hymen]] until [[marriage]]) {{fact}}. 

One appeal of heterosexual anal sex may be the fact that the anus is generally tighter than the vagina. Some consider penetrating the tighter orifice to be a more pleasurable experience.

In certain contexts male-male anal intercourse among males who otherwise identify as heterosexual is seen as a temporary behaviour to which they resort when confined in single-sex environments, such as [[prison sexuality|prisons]] or soldiers separated from partners. (See: ''[[Situational sexual behavior]]'' and ''[[Prison sex]]'') Some men have sex with men without categorising themselves as homosexual or bisexual. These [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) may still identify as heterosexual while engaging in same sex activity from time to time. (See [[Down-low]].)

==Anal sex among gay/bisexual men==
In modern times in Western cultures, anal sex is popularly associated with gay men, and studies (Lauman, for example) claim that about 80% of gay men in the United States have engaged in anal sex. 

Not all gay/[[bisexuality|bi]] men, however, regularly engage in anal sex or find it pleasurable. It may be that some gay/bi men try anal sex once, or a few times, and then rarely, if ever, engage in the practice again. Others may never try it at all. Some may reserve it only for committed relationships. Since data on gay (or bi) sexual behavior tends to arouse such controversy, it is difficult to make solid claims in this area.   

While some gay/bi male couples comprise an &quot;active&quot; partner and a &quot;receptive&quot; partner (a [[top (sex)|top]] and a [[bottom (sex)|bottom]]) this is not true of all gay/bi couples who practice anal sex: many gay/bi men who have anal sex both &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; at different times, also known as &quot;versatile&quot; or &quot;switch.&quot;  

Several [[gay slang]] terms are generally reserved for anal sex between two males, such as &quot;[[barebacking]]&quot; which refers to unprotected anal intercourse, ie. intercourse without the use of a condom.

== Cultural issues ==
[[Image:Suzuki Harunobu Shunga.jpg|thumb|[[Suzuki Harunobu]], ''Shunga''.]]

Historically, several cultures, such as [[homosexuality in Japan|medieval Japan]] and others are known to have been normative practitioners of male-male anal intercourse, often in the context of a mentor-student relationship between an adolescent male and an adult man (see [[pederasty]]).  Some claim that the males who participated in such relationships cannot properly be called [[homosexuality|homosexual]], arguing that in classical cultures such distinctions did not exist, and participation in these male-male relationships did not preclude sex with women.

The practice is thought to have been so common in [[Ancient Greece]] that the term &quot;Greek love&quot; was used to refer to the practice, and in modern times, &quot;Greek&quot; is sometimes used as [[slang]] for anal sex.  

The view that homosexual anal sex was a commonly accepted practice in Ancient Greece is widely disputed. Some literature has argued that the important social transgression was lowering oneself socially, that is, a high status person was not supposed to be penetrated by a lower status person, and thus passive anal intercourse by men was frowned upon in Ancient Greece and considered a serious moral transgression. Certainly, male passive anal intercourse was (officially) frowned-upon in Rome. Others have argued that in Greece, rather than anal sex, male-male couples actually engaged in non-penetrative [[interfemoral intercourse]].  However, this view has been disputed.   The historian K.J. Dover discusses these matters thoroughly in his classic work [[Greek Homosexuality]].

It has been argued that the alleged ancient aversion to male passive anal intercourse has fueled the long-standing moral disapproval of homosexuality. 



In several cultures, notably Japan, records (including detailed [[woodblock prints]]) leave no question that male-male couples did engage in penetrative anal intercourse.

The 19th century anthropologist [[Richard Francis Burton]] has theorized that there is a geographical [[Sotadic zone]] wherein male/male penetrative intercourse is particularly prevalent and accepted; moreover he was one of the first writers to advance the premise that such an orientation is biologically determined {{ref|burton1885}}.

In many cultures, even those where female receptive anal intercourse is considered normative, male receptive anal intercourse, even in a heterosexual context, is seen as taboo, or as less common.  In some cultures anal sex is so commonly linked with homosexuality that any male who engages in receptive anal intercourse is considered homosexual, even if he is penetrated by a female partner with a [[strap-on dildo]] ([[pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]]) or with her hand, fingers or [[Fisting|fist]]. In some cultures, only males who are penetrated by other males are considered homosexual, while males who penetrate other males are not.

Some women, both lesbians and heterosexual women, practice anal sex as the &quot;active&quot; partner, using fingers or sex toys to penetrate their partners.

== Health issues ==
Unprotected sex, including anal sex, is an effective means of transmitting [[Sexually-transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs). According to health-care professionals, [[condom]]s should always be used for anal intercourse, but they should not be considered an absolute safeguard. In principle, anal sex with anyone known to have a sexually transmissible disease, and indeed with anyone whose disease status has not been determined, should be avoided. HIV testing, however, can be unreliable; it is possible for someone who is  tested to receive a &quot;false negative&quot;. This advice applies to all sexual activity that effectively transmits STDs.

Anal penetration carries some risks which [[vaginal intercourse]], [[oral sex]], and &quot;[[outercourse]]&quot; do not. These are mostly due to two factors:

* The rectum and large intestine, unlike the vagina, do not contain their own [[vaginal lubrication|lubricating]] mechanism, which means friction or insertion damage can happen more easily. Also, the [[Biological tissue|tissue]]s in these areas are particularly delicate and susceptible to tearing, and the intestine as a whole twists and is much less strongly muscled and padded, which means physical injury is somewhat easier too. This is especially the case when using [[sex toy]]s, because forceful insertion of large or sharp objects can damage or even rupture it much more easily. 

* Part of the rectum's function is to absorb fluid into the blood stream, so it has strong blood circulation and is an easy barrier to cross if there is even a small tear in the intestinal lining; therefore infections can be transmitted easily. 

These risks can be mitigated by the use of [[personal lubricant]] and condoms, and taking care while using sex toys. Like all forms of penetrative sex with a non-exclusive partner, condoms should always be used for anal intercourse, but they should not be considered an absolute safeguard. Oil-based lubricants like [[Petroleum jelly|Vaseline]], however, destroy [[latex]] condoms, and the two should not be used together. Basic blood tests can be used to determine HIV status but may result in &quot;false positives&quot; or &quot;false negatives&quot;, and it is recommended that a person retest every six months to show a reliable reaction.

Since the rectal tissues are so easily damaged, and since the anorectal muscles are largely under involuntary control, slow, gentle, and responsive insertion is necessary to avoid pain and tearing. 

It is also very important to be careful when inserting objects into the anus. Objects with edges or points can cause severe injury. Moreover, objects could get lodged in the rectum, requiring medical intervention; hospital records confirm how inventive human beings can be in discovering objects to insert into their rectums. For this reason, most modern [[dildo]]s are made with flared bases. Additionally, nothing longer than eight inches (20 cm) should be inserted into the rectum without care and preparation. Objects forced more than seven or eight inches (17-20 cm) into the body risk colliding with the [[sigmoid colon]], a bend in the intestine, and in cases of rough handling, trauma can result in internal bleeding with potentially fatal results.

Nothing that has been placed in or at the anus, including fingers, should ever contact the vagina or the mouth, either externally or internally, without being thoroughly washed with anti-bacterial soap or a similar disinfectant, to avoid infection caused by the transmission of [[bacteria]] or by feces becoming lodged internally. Condoms can be placed over sex toys and latex or nitrile gloves can be worn to protect the hands and fingers. These should be used once and then discarded. Objects inserted in the anus should be washed carefully after every use. Shared sex toys can also transmit disease or infection, and should be thoroughly cleaned between use or be covered with a condom that is discarded between users. Silicone, metal acrylic, and glass dildos may be sterilized via cleaning and boiling instead. (See [[masturbation]] for more information on the use of sex toys.)

Some couples engage in &quot;[[felching]],&quot; where the top sucks out the semen he has deposited in the anus of the bottom as a result of &quot;bareback&quot; anal intercourse.  Like [[rimming]], this practice carries with it considerable health risks.

Like any form of sex, anal sex is rendered much more dangerous under the influence of [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or [[Recreational drug use|drugs]], which reduce responses, judgment, and ability to pay attention to one's own needs.

===Condoms &amp; Anal Sex===
[[Condom]]s are known to be less effective and more prone to burst or slip during anal sex than vaginal sex. It has been estimated that condoms fail anywhere from 10% - 32% of the time during anal sex. {{ref|silverman1997}} Due to this [[Durex]] has added a warning to boxes of their condoms saying &quot;for vaginal sex only&quot;.

'''Ålesund''' is a city and [[municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in the [[counties of Norway|county]] of [[Møre og Romsdal]], [[Norway]]. It is a sea port, 236 km north northeast of [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], and is noted for its unique concentration of [[Jugendstil]] or [[Art Nouveau]] [[architecture]].  

It occupies seven of the outer islands of the west coast, [[Hessa]], [[Aspøy]] and [[Nørvøy]],Yksnøy, Ellingsøy, Humla and Tørla which enclose the picturesque town. Ålesund has a pronounced [[maritime climate]] with mild and windy winters. The coldest temperature ever recorded at [[Vigra Airport]] is a mere -11&amp;deg;C (12&amp;deg;F). Ålesund received city rights in 1848, it is the administrative center as well as the principal shipping-place of the ''[[Sunnmøre]]'' district, and was one of the chief stations of the [[herring]] fishery in the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]].

Legend has it that ''Gangerolf'', outside of Norway better known as [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]], the [[10th century]] founder of the dynasty of the dukes of [[Normandy]], comes from the community of Giske, north west of Ålesund.
In the night of [[January 23]], [[1904]], the city was the scene of the [[Ålesund Fire]], one of the most terrible of the many conflagrations to which Norwegian towns, once built largely of wood, have been subjected.  Practically the whole town was destroyed, a gale aiding the flames, and the population had to leave the place in the middle of the night with only a few minutes' notice. 

[[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm]] of [[Germany]] had often vacationed in Sunnmøre.  After the fire, the Kaiser sent 4 ships with material to aid in the reconstruction. The town was rebuilt  in the [[Jugendstil]] architectural style (the German version of Art Noveau) with turrets, spires, and ornamentation. The structures were designed  by Norwegian architects educated in Trondheim, drawing inspiration from various styles throughout Europe, i.e Germany, Scotland, France, Belgium and Spain. The style was at its peak in Europe in 1900 and visitors can enjoy an unusually consistent architectural style.  

The local newspaper is [[Sunnmørsposten]].

The local [[football (soccer)|football]] team, [[Aalesunds Fotballklubb]] (AaFK), founded in 1914, played in the [[Norwegian Football League teams|Norwegian premier league]] for the first time in the 2003 season, and after 1 year in the 1. division in 2004, they are now back in the Tippeliga. The team's new arena, Color Line Stadion, opened 16th April 2005, a beautiful arena only 1 km outside town center.
The opening match was against Odd, and took place at 19.00 hours the same date. Ålesund won 2-1.
The local supporter club for Aafk is called &quot;Stormen&quot; or &quot;The Storm&quot; and the members are about 2000 local supporters living all over Norway showing off impressive patriotism at all home games, and also, in lesser numbers, at away games.
Unfortunately the 2005 season turned out bad for Aafk, and in spite of heroic fights at the end of the season, the team has to prepare for another season i 1.sivisjon in 2006.  However, the support from the people and industry in the region is quite impressive, and the goal is quite clear: Tippeligaen in 2007, and there to stay.
Several new players have been bought to strengthen the team, and the new coach, Per Joar Hansen(ex. RBK), seem to have what it takes to take the step again, into the top-team league in Norway.  Good Luck, Aafk!

== Economy == 
[[Image:hurtigr_aalesund_MH5Y3639_2.jpg|thumb|240px|MS Polarlys in Ålesund (December 2005)]]
Today Ålesund has one of the largest and important fishing harbors in Norway. Their fishing fleet belongs to one of the most modern in Europe. 
Ålesund is also one of the harbours the [[Hurtigruten]] is arriving a few times a week. The Hurtigruten, once known as the post ship fleet of Norway, is a favorite way to travel around Norway's coast.
&lt;br clear=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;

== Tourism ==
Ålesund is adjacent to the [[Hjørundfjord|Hjørund]] and [[Geirangerfjord|Geiranger]] [[fjord]]s, frequented by tourists.  From Øye at the head of [[Hjørundfjord]] a road strikes south to the [[Nordfjord]], and from Maråk on [[Geiranger]]fjord another strikes inland to [[Otta]]. From [[Åndalsnes]], 120 km east of Ålesund, the railway line ''[[Raumabanen]]'' goes to Dombås, then southwards on the ''[[Dovrebanen]]'' railway to [[Lillehammer]] and [[Oslo]].  Ålesund is a port of call for passenger and freight vessels travelling between [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Trondheim]], including the daily [[Hurtigruta]] (Norwegian Coastal Express ships).  

Ålesund is the site of an annual Norwegian Food Festival.

'''Aarau''' is the capital of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Aargau]]. It is predominantly [[German language|German]]-speaking and [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. Aarau is situated in the valley of the [[Aar]], on the river's right bank, and at the southern foot of the [[Jura mountains]].

An ancient fortress, Aarau was taken by the [[Bern]]ese in [[1415]], and in [[1798]] became for six months (March to [[September]]) the capital of the [[Helvetic Republic]].

'''Aargau''' ([[German language|German]] '''Aargau''', [[French language|French]] '''Argovie''', [[Italian language|Italian]] '''Argovia''', [[Romansh]] '''Argovia'''; anglicized '''Argovia''') is one of the more northerly [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Switzerland]]. It comprises the lower course of the [[river]] [[Aar]], which is why the canton is called Aargau (meaning ''Aar district'').

==Geography==
Its total area is 1,404 km&amp;sup2;, its population is 550,000 (as of 2002). The capital is [[Aarau]]. It borders [[Germany]] to the north. To the west lie the cantons of [[Basel-Landschaft]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]] and [[Canton of Bern|Bern]]. The canton of [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]] lies south of the canton of Aargau, [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]] and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]] to the east.

The canton of Aargau is one of the least mountainous Swiss cantons, forming part of a great table-land, to the north of the [[Alps]] and the east of the [[Jura mountains|Jura]], above which rise low hills.  The surface of the country is beautifully diversified, undulating tracts and well-wooded hills alternating with fertile valleys watered mainly by the Aar and its tributaries. The valleys alternate with pleasant hills, most of which are wooded.

It contains the famous hot sulphur springs of [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]] and [[Schinznach]], while at [[Rheinfelden]] there are very extensive saline springs. Just below [[Brugg]] the [[Reuss River|Reuss]] and the [[Limmat]] join the Aar, while around Brugg are the ruined castle of [[Habsburg]], the old convent of [[Koenigsfelden]] (with fine painted medieval glass) and the remains of the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement of ''Vindonissa'' ([[Windisch]]).

==History==
Argovia was the border region between [[Alamannia]] and [[Burgundy]], and was a disputed territory between these duchies. From the end of the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty up to 1415, it was ruled by the [[Habsburgs]], and many historical old castles can be found there. Examples include Habsburg, Lenzburg and Wildegg. There is also a number of former monasteries, such as in Wettingen and Muri. All of these were founded by the Habsburg family. They were closed by the government in 1841, which was one of the causes of the civil war called the &quot;[[Sonderbund War]],&quot; in 1847 in Switzerland.  Aargau is also believed to be the ancestral home of Reformist author [[George Mangold]] ([[1822-1894]]).

In 1415 the Aargau region was taken from the Habsburgs by the Swiss Confederates. [[Bern]] kept the south-west portion ([[Zofingen]], [[Aarburg]], [[Aarau]], [[Lenzburg]], and [[Brugg]]). Some districts, named the ''Freie Ämter'' or ''free bailiwicks'' (Mellingen, Muri, Villmergen, and Bremgarten), with the countship of Baden, were ruled as ''subject lands'' by all or certain of the Confederates. 

[[10 March]] - [[18 April]] [[1798]] it was under French occupation, thereafter the Bernese portion became the canton of Aargau of the [[Helvetic Republic]], the remainder forming the [[Canton of Baden]]. In 1803, the two halves were united under the name of canton of Aargau, which was then admitted a full member of the reconstituted Confederation. The [[Fricktal]], ceded in 1802 by [[Austria]], via Napoleonic France, to the Helvetic Republic, was shortly a separate Swiss canton under a ''[[Statthalter]]'' ('Lieutenant'), but on [[9 March]] [[1803]] became incorporated as part of the canton Aargau. 
The chief magistracy of Aargau changed its style repeatedly:
*first two consecutive ''[[Regierungsstatthalter]]'' : 
**April 1798 - November 1801 Jakob Emmanuel Feer (b. 1754 - d. 1833)  
**1802 - 1803 Johann Heinrich Rothpletz          (b. 1766 - d. 1833) 
*Presidents of the Government Commission 
**[[10 March]] [[1803]] - [[26 April]] [[1803]]  Johann Rudolf Dolder (b. 1753 - d. 1807) 
**[[26 April]] [[1803]] - 1815 a 'Small Council' (president rotating monthly) 
*annual ''[[Amtsbürgermeister]]'' 1815-1831
*annual ''[[Landammänner]]'' since 1815 

In the year 2003 the canton Aargau celebrated its 200&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday.

For centuries, two villages in the Aargau, Endingen and Lengnau, were the only places in Switzerland where Jews were permitted to live. They were not permitted to own houses or to live under the same roof with Christians. For the slow process of Jewish emancipation in Aargau and Switzerland, see link below.

==Economy==
The lands of the canton of Aargau are of the most fertile in Switzerland. [[Dairy farming]], crops and fruits are of the principal economic activities in the canton. Industry is developed, particularly in electrical engineering, precision instruments, [[iron]], [[steel]] and [[cement]].

Three out of four of Switzerland's nuclear power plants are in the canton of Aargau (Beznau, Gösgen and Leibstadt). Additionally the many rivers supply enough water for a lot of hydroelectrical power plants throughout the canton. The canton of Aargau is often called &quot;the energy canton&quot;.

A significant number of people commutes into the financial centre of the city of [[Zürich]] just across the cantonal border.

Tourism is of significant size, particularly caused by the hot springs at Baden and Schinznach Bad. Hillwalking is another source of tourists, but only of limited significance.

==Municipalities==
There are a total of 231 municipalities in the canton of Aargau.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Ababda''' (or '''Ababde''') (the Gebadei of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], possibly the [[Troglodyte]]s of classical writers), are a [[nomad]] [[tribe]] of [[Africa]]n [[Bedouin]]s, a subgroup of the [[Beja people]]; some still speak the [[Cushitic]] [[Beja language]], while others speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

They extend from the [[Nile]] at [[Aswan]] to the [[Red Sea]], and reach northward to the Kena-Kosseir road, thus occupying the southern border of [[Egypt]] east of the Nile. They call themselves &quot;sons of the Jinns.&quot; With some of the clans of the [[Bisharin]] and possibly the [[Hadendoa]] they represent the [[Blemmyes]] of classic geographers, and their location today is almost identical with that assigned them in [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times.

They were constantly at war with the Romans, who eventually conquered them. In the middle ages they were known as Beja, and convoyed pilgrims from the Nile valley to [[Aidhab]], the port of embarkation for [[Jedda]]. From time immemorial they have acted as guides to caravans through the [[Nubia]]n desert and up the Nile valley as far as Sennar.

They intermarried with the Nuba, and settled in small colonies at [[Shendi]] and elsewhere up to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mehmet Ali]]'s conquest of the region in the early 19th century. They are still great trade carriers, and visit very distant districts.

[[As of 1911]], the Ababda of Egypt numbered some 30,000, and were governed by an hereditary &quot;chief&quot;. Although nominally a vassal of the Khedive, he paid no tribute. Indeed he was paid a subsidy, a portion of the road-dues, in return for his safeguarding travellers from [[Bedouin]] robbers. The sub-[[sheikh]]s were directly responsible to him.

The Ababda of [[Nubia]], according to Joseph von Russegger who visited the country in [[1836]], number some 40,000, but have since diminished, probably amalgamated with the Bisharin, their hereditary enemies.  The Ababda generally speak Arabic (mingled with [[Barabra]] [[Nubian Language|Nubian]] words), the result of their long-continued contact with Egypt; but the southern and south-eastern portion of the tribe in many cases still retain their Beja language, To Bedawie. Those of [[Kosseir]] would not speak this before strangers in 1911, as they believed that to reveal the mysterious dialect would bring ruin on them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''American Quarter Horse''' is a [[Horse breeds|breed]] of [[horse]] originally bred specifically to race the quarter mile.  It is commonly believed to be the world's fastest horse, some having been clocked at 55 mph at the finish line in racing events. It is today equally well known for its performance in [[rodeo]]s and horse shows. The compact body of the Quarter Horse is well-suited to the intricate and speedy maneuvers required in roping, reining, cutting, working cow horse and other stock-horse events.  Riders are also known to show Quarter Horses in English and Hunt classes, although these types of events are more normally dominated by [[Thoroughbred]]s and [[Warmblood]] crosses. Also known as &quot;America's Horse&quot;, the Quarter Horse is the most popular breed in the United States. They can also boast the largest breed society in the world, with over 4 million Quarter Horses registered worldwide.

==Breed History==

The American colonists began, in the 1690s, to cross imported English horses with Chickasaw Ponies (which originated from Spanish and Barb stock brought over to Americas by the [[conquistadors]]). The resulting horse was small, hardy, and quick, and it was used as a work horse during the week, and a race horse on the weekend. The influence of [[Thoroughbreds]] like Janus and Matchem contributed crucial genes that developed the colonial &quot;Quarter Mile Horse&quot; into a speedy working man's racer.

As flat racing became popular with the colonists, this horse gained even more popularity as a sprinter. Even when matched against a [[Thoroughbred]], the small horse often won in short, quarter-mile races. As the American Thoroughbred breed was established many colonial Quarter Mile mares were included in the original stud books, starting a long association between the Throughbred breed and what would later become officially known as the &quot;Quarter Horse&quot;, accentuating distance it excelled in.

In the 1800s, pioneers heading West wanted a hardy, willing horse. As they forged into unsettled territories they found large herds of feral horses that descended from the Spanish stock Hernan Cortes had introduced into the viceroyalty of New Spain (later to be known as Mexico). As the colonial Quarter Mile Horse was crossed with the native horses of Iberian origin, the pioneers found that this cross had innate &quot;cow sense,&quot; and its popularity grew with cattlemen on ranches. 

Although working cattle was always the main justification of the ranch horse of the American west the sprint races were always a big part of the weekend entertainment on bush tracks around the country. As a result horses with early speed that also offered an advantage in ranching chores like roping, became important contributors to the breed that was taking shape the western territories. Names like Peter McCue, King Plaudit, Blob, Johnny Dial, Top Deck, Vandy, Three Bars and Truckle Feature are just some of the influential names that brought in more speed emphasizing Thoroughbred bloodlines into the American Quarter Horse breed. As a result, the valued attributes of race horse and show horse competitor were added to its aptitudes on the ranch. Even after the invention of the automobile, the Quarter Horse was never stopped being bred for cattle work. Today large purses have given rise to horses and riders with over a million dollar earnings in stock horse events that are open to all breeds but dominated by American Quarter Horse. At the race track the American Quarter Horse offers a wide assortment of parimutial races with purses as high as two million dollars per race. 

This has all been made possible because in 1940, the [[American Quarter Horse Association]] (AQHA) was formed to preserve the breed. Before and after the American Quarter Horse formally established itself as a breed it has always benefited from [[Thoroughbred]] bloodlines, so as a result their stud book has always remained open to this breed. This is not unusual in the stock horse industry as the Appaloosa has had an open registry to the [[Thoroughbred]], [[Arabian]] and American Quarter Horse; the [[American Paint Stock Horse]] has had an open registry to the American Quarter Horse; the [[Azteca]] is still a composite of the American Quarter Horse and [[Andalusian]] breeds; the [[Criollo]] has had an open registry to the Chilean Horse. Really the only stock horse breed that has had a closed registry since it was first officially started in 1893 is the [[Chilean Horse]].

Today, Europe has been importing Quarter Horses at nearly the same rate North America imports [[warmblood]]s. Germany and Italy in particular have been drawn to this breed. The horses are not only ideal for ranch and cattle work, barrel racing, and gymkhana events, but have also been trained to international levels of dressage and are generally very good jumpers. In addition, it has also been proven to be a very useful horse in the sport of Bullfighting.  In Portugal and Spain, they have been known to mix the breed with Lusitanos, making it an exceptional cross-breed.  The combination of the two gives the beauty and bravery of the Lusitano, while the strength &amp; speed is from the AQH.

Although this breed started as America's Horse it is rapidly becoming the World's Horse. The second highest registry of Quarter Horses takes place in Brazil and Australia is not far behind. With the internationalization of the discipline of reining and its acceptance as one of the official seven events on the [[World Equestrian Games]], now there is a growing interest in Quarter Horses the world over. Countries like Japan, Switzerland and Israel that did not have a traditional stock horse industry have been lured to compete on sturdy American Quarter Horses in their own country and abroad.

==Breed Characteristics==
[[Image:Brauner.JPG|right|200px]]
There are as many types of Quarter Horses as there are types of work they do. However, there are two main body types: the stock type and the running type. The stock horse type is shorter, more compact, stocky and very well muscled, yet agile. The running Quarter Horse is lighter, similar to a [[Thoroughbred]], and is built to sprint. 

Quarter Horses shown in hand &quot;at halter&quot; have a heavy-bodied appearance due to their incredibly muscular build, and small typey heads that usually have large jowls and refined muzzles. Reiners and cutters are smaller, with cat-like, quick movement and very powerful hindquarters. Western pleasure horses have a more level topline and smooth gaits. Quarter Horse racehorses have long legs and are much leaner than their &quot;stock horse&quot; counterparts. The show hunter type is similar to the running type Quarter Horse although many are even of a taller and thinner phenotype. However, all Quarter Horses have speed, stamina, power, and a great willingness to please.

Quarter Horses come in all colors, except spotted or pinto colors, with sorrel and bay being the most common color. They usually stand 14-16 hands high, although there are exceptions that may be as tall as 17 hands. The breed stipulates registerable height. 

The Thoroughbred breed is an accepted outcross for Quarter Horses; the major Quarter Horse breed registry (the largest horse registry in the world), the American Quarter Horse Association, accepts Quarter Horse/Thoroughbred crosses into the registry as &quot;Appendix Quarter Horses.&quot; These animals are popular for Quarter Horse Racing and for Jumping and Hunter events. After meeting a series of conformational and performance criteria, these Appendix Quarter Horses can obtain permanent registration numbers. Since American Quarter Horse/Thoroughbred crosses continue to have an opportunity to enter the official registry of the American Quarter Horse breed, this is creating a continual gene flow from the Thoroughbred breed into the American Quarter Horse breed, which has been influential in altering many of the characteristics that typified the breed in the early years of its formation.

One feature of conformation of note that is easily recognizable is the obvious lack of proportion between the front shoulders and the hindquarters.  Quarterhorses have big hind ends.  One of the fastest ever was named Peter McCue.  He was unofficially clocked at 21 seconds flat in a warm up to a race by three people.  It was unofficial because it was a warm up run, before dawn, and Peter was running by himself, but it was clocked at 21 seconds by three people.

'''Abacá''', ah buh KAH, (''Musa textilis'') is a species of [[banana]] native to the [[Philippines]], grown widely as well in [[Borneo]] and [[Sumatra]]. The plant is of major economical importance, being harvested for its fibre, called [[Manila hemp]], extracted from the large, oblong [[leaf|leaves]] and stems. On average, the plant grows about 20 feet (6 metres) tall. The fibre is used for making twines and ropes. The plant's name is sometimes spelt '''Abaká'''.

==Composition==

The leaves grow from the trunk of the plant, and the bases of the leaves form a [[sheath|''sheath'']] (covering) around the trunk. These sheaths contain the valuable fibre. The coarse fibres range from 5 to 11 1/2 feet (1.5 to 3.5 metres) in length. They are composed primarily of the plant materials [[cellulose]], [[lignin]], and [[pectin]]. After the fibre has been separated, it is sold under the name [[Manila hemp|Manila]]. The fibre gets its name from the capital of the [[Philippines]].

==Harvesting==

Growers harvest abacá fields every three to eight months. They cut down the mature plants, but allow the roots to remain in the ground. New plants then grow from the old roots. The leaf sheaths are detached in strips. The pulp is scraped off, leaving only the fibre strands, which are twisted into rope. Abacá fibre is strong, buoyant, and has a great natural resistance to water, sun, and wind. Abacá is also used for paper products.

==Scientific classification==

The abacá plant belongs to the [[banana]] family, Musaceae. Its scientific name is ''Musa textilis''.

Other common names for Manila hemp include Cebu hemp and Davao hemp.

'''Abaddon''' is a [[Biblical Hebrew]] word meaning &quot;destruction&quot;.

In [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] poetry (Job 26:6; Proverbs 15:11) it comes to mean &quot;place of destruction&quot;, or the realm of the dead, and is associated with [[Sheol]].  Abaddon is also one of the compartments of [[Gehenna]].

In [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 9:11, it is described personified as the [[Abaddon (demon)|demon Abaddon]], &quot;Angel of the Abyss&quot;, rendered in Greek as [[Apollyon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abae''' (rabai), is a town in the N.E. corner of [[Phocis]], in
[[Greece]], famous in early times for its [[oracle]] of [[Apollo]], 
one of those consulted by [[Croesus]] (Herod. i. 46). It was 
rich in treasures (Herod. viii. 33), but was sacked by the 
[[Iran|Persia]]ns, and the [[temple (Greek)|temple]] remained in a ruined state.  The 
oracle was, however, still consulted, e.g. by the [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebans]] 
before [[Leuctra]] (Paus. iv. 32. 5). The temple seems to have 
been burnt again during the [[Sacred War]], and was in a very 
dilapidated state when seen by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (x. 35), though 
some restoration, as well as the building of a new temple, 
was undertaken by [[Hadrian]].  The sanctity of the shrine 
ensured certain privileges to the people of Abac (Bull.  
Corresp.  Hell. vi. 171), and these were confirmed by the 
Romans.  The [[polygonal]] wabs of the acropolis may still be 
seen in a fair state of preservation on a circular hill 
standing about 500 ft. above the little plain of Exarcho; 
one gateway remains, and there are also traces of town walls 
below.  The temple site was on a low spur of the hill, below the 
town.  An early terrace wall supports a precinct in which are 
a [[stoa]] and some remains of temples; these were excavated by the 
British School at [[Athens, Greece|Athens]] in [[1894]], but very little was found.

'''Abakan''' ({{lang-ru|Абака&amp;#769;н}}) is the capital of the [[Khakassia|Republic of Khakassia]] in [[Russia]], in South [[Siberia]]. It is located in the central part of [[Minusinsk Depression]], at the confluence of the rivers [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]] and [[Abakan River|Abakan]], at {{coor dm|53|43|N|91|27|E|}}; at approximately the same longitude as [[Hamburg]] and [[Minsk]]. Population: 165,197 ([[2002]] [[Russian Census (2002)|Census]]); 159,000 ([[January 1]], [[1994]] est.). 

Abakan fort ({{lang|ru|Абаканский острог}}) was built at this location in [[1675]], also known as '''Abakansk'''. In [[Russian Empire]] it belonged to [[Yenisei]] [[gubernia]]. During [[1823]]&amp;ndash;[[1931]] the grown settlement was known as '''Ust-Abakanskoye''', [[1914]]&amp;ndash;[[1925]]: Abakan, [[1925]]&amp;ndash;[[1931]]: '''Khakassk'''. It received the status of town and its current name in 1931. 

Abakan (together with [[Tayshet]]) was a terminal of the major [[Abakan-Taishet Railway]]. Now it is an important railway junction.

The city has a river port, an airport, industry enterprises, university, three theatres.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abana''' (or AMANAH, classical Chrysorrhoas) and PHARPAR, 
the &quot;rivers of [[Damascus, Syria]]&quot; (2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] v. 12), now generally identified with the Barada (i.e. ''cold'') and the A`waj 
(i.e. ''crooked'') respectively, though if the reference 
to Damascus be limited to the city, as in the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] 
version of the [[Old Testament]], Pharpar would be the modern 
[[Taura]].  Both streams run from west to east across the plain of 
Damascus, which owes to them much of its fertility, and lose 
themselves in marshes, or lakes, as they are called, on the 
borders of the great [[Arabia]]n desert.  [[John McGregor]], who gives 
an interesting description of them in his Rob Roy on the 
[[Jordan River|Jordan]], affirmed that as a work of hydraulic engineering, 
the system and construction of the canals, by which the Abana 
and Pharpar were used for irrigation, might be considered as 
one of the most complete and extensive in the world.  As the 
Barada escapes from the mountains through a narrow gorge, 
its waters spread out fan-like, in canals or ''rivers'', the 
name of one of which, Nahr [[Banias]], retains a trace of Abana.

The '''Arc de Triomphe''' is a monument in [[Paris]] that stands in the centre of the [[Place de l'Étoile]], at the western end of the [[Champs-Élysées]]. Coordinates: {{coor dms|48|52|25.5|N|2|17|41.5|E|}}. It is the linchpin of the historic axis (''L'[[Axe historique]]'') leading from the courtyard of the [[Louvre]] Palace, a sequence of monuments and grand thoroughfares on a route leading out of Paris. The monument's iconographic program pitted heroically nude French youths against bearded Germanic warriors in chain mail and set the tone for public monuments with triumphant nationalistic messages until [[World War I]].

The monument stands over [[1 E1 m|51&amp;nbsp;metres]] (165&amp;nbsp;feet) in height and is 45&amp;nbsp;metres wide. It is the second largest [[triumphal arch]] in existence ([[North Korea]] built a [[Arch of Triumph (Pyongyang)|slightly larger Arch of Triumph]] in [[1982]] for the 70th birthday of [[Kim Il-Sung]]); the Arc de Triomphe is so colossal that an early daredevil flew his plane through it.
[[Image:250px-Arc-de-triomphe-paris.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Arc de Triomphe by night]]

It was commissioned in [[1806]] after the victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] at the peak of his fortunes and finally completed &amp;mdash; after a long pause during the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Restoration]] &amp;mdash; in the reign of [[Louis-Philippe of France|King Louis-Philippe]], in 1833-36. The sculpture representing ''Peace'' was now interpreted as commemorating the ''Peace of 1815'' &amp;mdash; not the original intention.

The astylar design is by [[Jean Chalgrin]] (1739-1811), in the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] version of ancient [[Roman architecture]]. Major [[academy|academic]] sculptors of France are represented in the sculpture of the Arc de Triomphe:  [[Jean-Pierre Cortot|Cortot]], [[François Rude|Rude]], [[Antoine Étex|Étex]], [[James Pradier|Pradier]] and [[Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire|Lemaire]]. The main sculptures are not integral friezes but are treated as independent trophies applied to the vast ashlar masonry masses, not unlike the gilt-bronze appliqués on Empire furniture. The four sculptural groups at the base of the Arc are ''The Triumph of 1810'' (Jean-Pierre Cortot), ''Resistance'' and ''Peace'' (both by [[Antoine Étex]]) and the most renowned of them all, ''Departure of the Volunteers of '92'' commonly called ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' ([[François Rude]]). The face of the allegorical representation of France calling forth her people on this last was used as the belt buckle for the seven-star rank of [[Marshal]] of France. 
[[Image:IMG_0082(arc de triomphe).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Under the coffered vault : heroic bas-reliefs above the tablets of names]]
In the attic above the richly sculptured [[frieze]] of soldiers are 30 shields engraved with the names of major [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic military victories]]. The inside walls of the monument list the names of 558 French generals. The names of those who died in battle are underlined (''illustration, right'').

The Place de l'Étoile was extensively redesigned by [[Baron Haussmann]], who increased the number of avenues radiating from this star to twelve. In the [[1860s]]  he ran a circular road (''rue de Tilsitt-Presbourg'') round the outside of the houses fronting the ''Étoile,'' a planning feature intended to free the Place itself from the crush of carriages that might be expected where so many stylish tenants lived so closely together. Haussmann imposed a uniform design on the house fronts with small gardens at the back giving on to this circular road. Haussmann's memoirs publicly noted that the official façade design, from [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff|Hittorff]] in his own office, was so poor that he had to mask the fronts with trees. But the uniformity complements the Arc's monumental presence. The traffic problem was not resolved, however.
[[Image:Arc de Triomphe1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysées]]
The sword carried by the ''Republic'' in the ''Marseillaise'' relief broke off, on the day, it is said, that the [[Battle of Verdun]] began in [[1916]]. The relief was immediately hidden by tarpaulins to conceal the accident and avoid any undesired ominous interpretations. 
Famous victory marches past the Arc included the Germans in [[1871]], the French in [[1918]], the Germans in [[1940]], and the French and Allies in [[1944]] and [[1945]]. [[Charles de Gaulle]] survived an attack upon him at the Arc during a parade. 
[[Image:Unknownsoldier_paris.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier beneath the Arc de Triomphe, Paris]]
Beneath the Arc is the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] from the [[World War I|First World War]]. Interred here on [[Armistice Day]] [[1920]], it has the first [[eternal flame]] lit in Western Europe since the [[Vestal Virgin]]s' fire was extinguished in the year [[391]]. It burns in memory of the dead who were never identified, now in both World Wars. France took the example of the [[United Kingdom]]'s tomb of [[The Unknown Warrior]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]. A ceremony is held there every [[November 11]] on the anniversary of the [[armistice]] signed between France and Germany in [[1918]]. It was originally decided in [[November 12]], [[1919]] to bury the unknown soldier's remains in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]], but a public letter-writing campaign led to the decision to bury him beneath the Arc. The coffin was put in the chapel on the first floor of the Arc on [[November 10]], [[1920]], and put in its final resting place on [[January 28]], [[1921]]. The slab on top carries the inscription &lt;small&gt;ICI REPOSE UN SOLDAT FRANÇAIS MORT POUR LA PATRIE 1914–1918&lt;/small&gt; (&quot;Here lies a French soldier who died for his country 1914–1918&quot;).

==Miscellaneous==

* The [[Tour de France]] race culminates here every year.

* Pedestrian access to the Arc de Triomphe is via an underpass. [[Paris Metro|Metro]] access is [[Charles de Gaulle - Étoile (Paris Metro)|Charles-de-Gaulle–Étoile]]. From the top there is an excellent view of all of Paris, of the twelve major avenues leading to the Arc and of the exceptionally busy roundabout in which the Arc lies.

* The Arch is destroyed by the [[Eiffel Tower]] in ''[[Team America: World Police]]''. In ''Rugrats in Paris: The Movie'', the babies inside the giant Reptar [[invention]] move fast under the arch. In the [[Godzilla]] film ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]'' it is destroyed by [[Gorosaurus]] who had dug underneath it.

* A smaller, highly detailed replica of the Arc was constructed at the [[Paris Las Vegas]] resort.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AmazoniteColorado.jpg|thumb|right|Microcline feldspar variety Amazonite from Jefferson, Colorado]]
'''Amazonite''' (sometimes called &quot;Amazon stone&quot;) is a green variety of [[microcline]] [[feldspar]].

The name is taken from that of the [[Amazon River]], from which certain green stones were formerly obtained, but it is doubtful whether green [[feldspar]] occurs in the Amazon area.

Amazonite is a mineral of limited occurrence. Formerly it was obtained almost exclusively from the area of [[Miyask]] in the [[Ilmen mountains]], 50 miles southwest of [[Chehabinsk]], [[Russia]], where it occurs in granitic rocks. More recently, high-quality crystals have been obtained from [[Pikes Peak|Pike's Peak]], [[Colorado]], where it is found associated with smoky [[quartz]], [[orthoclase]], and [[albite]] in a coarse [[granite]] or [[pegmatite]]. Some other localities in the [[United States]] yield amazonite, and it is also found in [[pegmatite]] in [[Madagascar]].

Because of its bright [[green]] colour when polished, amazonite is sometimes cut and used as a [[gemstone]].

For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Naturally, many people assumed the color was due to copper because [[copper]] compounds often have blue and green colors. More recent studies suggest that the blue-green color is due to small quantities of [[lead]] and water in the feldspar. (Hoffmeister and Rossman, 1985)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anthroposophy''', also called [[spiritual science]] by its founder, [[Rudolf Steiner]] is an attempt to investigate and describe [[spiritual]] phenomena with the same precision and clarity with which [[natural science]] investigates and describes the physical world. Steiner described his approach as &quot;soul-observations using scientific methodology&quot;. (Steiner, [1893] 1995). His ideas have their roots in the flowering of Germanic culture that resulted in the transcendent philosophy of [[Hegel]], [[Fichte]] and [[Schelling]], on the one hand, and the poetic and scientific works of [[Goethe]], upon whom Steiner draws heavily, on the other. 

The word anthroposophy is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] roots meaning human wisdom. (Anthroposophy should not be confused with [[Anthropology]], the [[empirical]] study of human cultures.) Anthroposophy is not one of the natural sciences, though in particular areas anthroposophic research claims to have achieved scientific recognition.  (See below for further information about the relationship of anthroposophy to the natural sciences.) Anthroposophy has been fruitful for many areas of life, especially [[education]], [[organic farming]], [[medicine]] including care of the [[mentally handicapped]], and [[Spiritual Science|spirituality]]; see ''Successes of Anthroposophy'', below. 

==History==
In his early twenties, Steiner was asked to edit [[Goethe]]'s scientific writings for a major publication of that writer's complete works. In the course of this work, Steiner began publishing various works that foreshadowed his later ideas, but were still set within the philosophical and scientific framework of his age: chiefly ''Goethe's Conception of the World'' and his commentaries on Goethe's scientific essays. His first [[Philosophy of Freedom | masterwork, ''Die Philosophie der Freiheit'']] (translated variously as ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity'', ''The Philosophy of Freedom'', or ''Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path''), was published when he was in his early thirties. Here, Steiner set forth a conception of free will that was strongly founded upon inner experiences, especially those that occur in independent thought, without any explicit references to the potentially spiritual nature of these experiences. His first reference to 'anthroposophy' dates from this early period.

Steiner's further development led him further and further into explicitly spiritual philosophical studies. These studies were chiefly interesting to others who were already oriented towards spiritual ideas; chief amongst these, at least in Steiner's middle phase of development, was the [[Theosophical Society]]. He was asked to lead the German section of this primarily [[Anglo-American]] group. His work was distinct from that of most other members of the Society (exceptions included [[Bertram Kingsley]] in England) and both he and the then president of the Theosophical Society appear to have 'agreed to disagree' in an at first harmonious way. By [[1907]], however, there was a growing split between the group around Steiner, who was trying to develop a path that embraced such cornerstones of Western civilizations as [[Christianity]] and [[natural science]], and the mainstream Theosophical Society, which was oriented toward an [[Eastern Region|Eastern]], and especially [[India|Indian]], approach.

The [[Anthroposophical Society]] was formed in [[1912]] after Steiner left the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]] over differences with its leader, [[Annie Besant]]. She intended to present to the world the child [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as [[Christ]] [[reincarnation|reincarnated]].  Steiner strongly objected, and considered any equation between Krishnamurti and Christ to be nonsense (as did Krishnamurti himself once he had reached adulthood). This and the philosophical differences mentioned above led Steiner to leave the Theosophical Society.  He was followed by a large number of members of the Theosophical Society's German Section, of which he had been secretary. Members of other national chapters of the Theosophical Society followed.

By this time, Steiner had reached considerable stature as a spiritual teacher. He claimed to have direct experiences of the [[Akashic Records]] (by Steiner sometimes called the &quot;Akasha Chronicle&quot;), a spiritual chronicle of the history and pre-history of the world encoded in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], and allegedly available to anyone who takes the time to develop sufficient powers of spiritual vision.  Sound vision could be developed, Steiner said, in part by practicing rigorous forms of ethical and cognitive self-discipline, concentration and meditation.  However, no anthroposophist since Steiner has yet claimed to be able to read the Akashic Records to any great degree. According to Steiner, one's ethical development must precede the development of spiritual faculties. By all accounts, Steiner was an unusually upright and ethical human being who fostered an atmosphere of freedom, tolerance, creativity and humor in all his personal and work relationships.

By [[1912]], a flowering of artistic work inspired by Steiner and the anthroposophical movement was well underway. New directions in [[drama]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[Eurythmy|artistic movement]] and [[architecture]] all came together in a grand theatre center, the First [[Goetheanum]], built in the years [[1913]]-[[1920]]. To a significant extent this was built by volunteers from many countries and much of the work was accomplished during the [[First World War]]. The international community of workers, artists and scientists that came together around the project in [[Neutral country|neutral]] [[Switzerland]] existed in sharp contrast to the war-torn European nations around.

After [[World War I]], the anthroposophical movement took on new directions. Practical projects such as schools, centers for the handicapped, organic farms and medical clinics were established, all inspired by anthroposophical research. Each of these used ideas that seemed radical at the time; many of these ideas - such as organic agriculture - are now, nearly a century later, appreciated as important directions for our society's future development.

Steiner died in [[1925]], but anthroposophical work has continued in all of the areas established during his lifetime as well as in many new projects established since. Seminars, artistic trainings, and institutions such as schools, banks, farms and clinics flourish throughout the world, all inspired by the idea that spiritual work can be systematically and methodically pursued in harmony with outer endeavors.

==Description==
Anthroposophy, though appreciative of all religions and cultural developments, emphasizes recent Western (rather than older [[Hindu]] or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]) esoteric thought as being more appropriate to contemporary needs, and perceives [[Christ]] and His mission on earth as having a particularly important place in human evolution, though these are not viewed in the same way as in the mainstream Christian churches. Steiner emphasized that the being that manifests in Christianity also manifests in all faiths and religions; it is the being that unifies all religions, and not a particular religious faith, that Steiner saw as the central force in human evolution. Steiner's [[Christianity]] differs also from that of the [[Gnostics]] who viewed the Christ phenomenon through the knowledge gained through earlier [[gnosticism]], whereas for Steiner Christ's incarnation was a historical reality and a pivotal and unique point in human history.

Anthroposophy encourages clear and free thought, and the development of human consciousness beyond the material senses. It also encourages the artistic expression of one's perceptions. Steiner defined it as &quot;a path of knowledge leading the Spiritual in the human being to the Spiritual in the universe.&quot;

His concept of man includes the idea that man has inhabited [[earth]] since its creation, albeit in a spiritual form. This spiritual form then processed through a number of stages to reach its current form, stages which included emanation of lesser beings such as animals and plants. Thus every living thing has evolved from mankind (although &quot;mankind&quot; is not here seen in its usual sense, but includes its earlier spiritual forms).

The anthroposophist's way could be said to go through becoming more conscious and deliberate about one's thoughts and deeds, but also by becoming more perceptive of and in tune with the spirit in himself and outside of himself . One may reach higher levels of [[consciousness]] through [[meditation]] and [[observation]]. Steiner described and developed numerous exercises for the realization of these goals.

Steiner's description of the [[human being]] as consisting of seven intimately connected parts, starting on the material level and reaching up into the spiritual levels - and several of which are still in development - is similar to that found in Theosophy.

This view is thoroughly explained in many of Steiner's writings and lectures, particularly in his books ''Theosophy'', and ''An Outline of Occult Science''.

Anthroposophists however also hold a fourfold view, which Steiner expands on very frequently and puts to practical uses in subjects such as medicine and child education:
*the [[physical body]], 
*the life or [[etheric body]], the organization of forces of metamorphosis and growth for living beings
*the consciousness or [[astral body]], and 
*the [[ego]] or &quot;[[I]]&quot; of the human being.

==Place in Western Philosophy==
The [[Epistemology|Epistemic]] basis for Anthroposophy is contained in the seminal work, [[Philosophy of Freedom | ''The Philosophy of Freedom'']], as well as in Steiner's doctoral thesis, ''Truth and Science''. These and several other early books by Steiner anticipated 20th century continental philosophy's gradual overcoming of [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] idealism and of [[Kant|Kantian]] subjectivism. Like [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Ortega y Gasset]], Steiner was profoundly influenced by the works of [[Franz Brentano]] (whose lectures he had heard as a student at the University of Vienna) and had read [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] in depth. Through Steiner's early epistemological and philosophical works, he became one of the first European philosophers to overcome the subject-object split that [[Descartes]], classical physics, and various complex historical forces had impressed upon [[Western thought]] for several centuries. His philosophical work was taken up in the middle of the twentieth century by [[Owen Barfield]], a philosopher of language from [[Oxford University]] and through him influenced the [[Inklings]], a group that included such writers as [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[C.S. Lewis]]. It was also taken up by the philosopher (and prolific author) Herbert Witzenmann. Steiner's philosophy has not found widespread recognition by academic philosophers outside of the anthroposophical movement, however; one exception is Richard Tarnas, author of ''The Passion of the Western Mind''. 

Steiner's philosophy begins by recognizing a division between our sensory experiences of the outer world and our soul experiences of an inner world consisting of thoughts, feelings and intentions (will impulses). He focuses on how our thinking in particular complements what we experience through the senses; one facet of the world is its outer appearance, a second is its inner structure. We access the two separately but they are originally united in the objective world, and we have the capacity to reunite them through creating a relationship between our percepts and our concepts, between what we experience outwardly and inwardly. He claims we only understand an aspect of the outer world when we find this connection between our sensory impressions of it and our concepts about it.

Thus, though all experience begins subject to the subject-object divide, through our own activity Steiner says we can progressively overcome this divide. This lies in our free will, however; we are given the divide but not its overcoming.

Steiner also examines the step from thinking as determined by outer impressions to what he calls sense-free thinking. Thoughts without sensory content, for example mathematical or logical thinking, is clearly a free deed. He thus believes he locates the origin of the free will in our thinking, and in particular in sense-free thinking. Especially in his later work, Steiner asserts that the objective truths attainable through [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] are evidence of an objective non-sensory world - a world of spirit/mind that is not subject to the subjective nature of our inner experiences. (The German word Geist means both [[spirit]] and [[mind]].)

==Relationship to Natural Science==
Anthroposophy explicitly seeks to extend [[natural science]]'s mandate, which is to study the world as external observers (a mandate which some say has been shaken by [[quantum mechanics]]' rejection of the possibility of splitting the observer from the observed phenomena), to explore human experience from within. It postulates that, as we have learned over centuries and even millennia to treat our experience of the outer world in a clear and systematic way, we can also learn to do this for our experience of out inner life.

It believes the genuine and even scientific study of man, need not restrict itself to externally observable phenomena. If an equally objective description of human soul and spiritual life can be achieved, these too can be elevated to a science. ''Natural'' science thus sets the example and provides a methodological goal; the potential content of observation is however extended to experiences beyond the purely sensory.

Today's science already recognizes the scientific validity of our inner, soul states in the special case of our thinking. The discipline of science assumes that scientific reasoning is possible, i.e.in anthroposophical terms, that our soul experience of thinking can be as [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[verification|verifiable]] as the [[senses|sensory phenomena]] themselves. Natural science thus allows inner, thought processes as part of the ''methodology'' of science, but excludes them from being the subject of scientific work. If thinking can be objective about sensory phenomena, however, can it not be objective about its own activity, and by extension, to the rest of our inner life? 

Natural science even includes non-sensory phenomena as the content of its study in the special case of mathematics. Is the number two purely non-sensory? What about 'i', [[Imaginary unit|the square root of negative one]]? Mathematics provides a doorway through which we can see how a scientific treatment of nonsensory phenomena may be valid.

Key here is that the scientific standards of a rigorously logical approach, duplicability of results and intersubjectivity are not lost. Much of today's spirituality is thus not spiritual science. Anthroposophy respects religious and spiritual life that is not scientific as having its own proper place in culture, just as our free exploration of nature has its place next to natural science. Often such excursions give just the raw material out of which scientific understanding is born. It seeks, however, to make a step from free experience of soul and spiritual life to a scientifically motivated description of these, with the motive of bringing clarity and a higher understanding to the 'buzzing, blooming confusion' that reigns as strongly in inner experiences as in the natural world.

==Applications==
Practical results of Anthroposophy include work in:

*Architecture ([[Goetheanum]]), 
*[[Biodynamic agriculture]], 
*Holistic [[Waldorf Education]] 
*[[Astrosophy]] as opposed to [[Astrology]], 
*[[Anthroposophical Medicine]] ([[Weleda]]), 
*Philosophy (The &quot;Philosophy of Freedom&quot;), 
*[[Goethean Science]] resulting in new developments in the Arts, 
*[[Eurythmy]] (&quot;movement as visible speech&quot;), 
*Centres for helping the mentally handicapped ([[Camphill Villages]]) and
*Religion ([[The Christian Community]])

Medical doctors in the Anthroposophy movement use, amongst others, [[homeopathy]] as a part of their medical practices. In addition, Steiner gave several series of lectures to physicians, and out of this grew a medical movement that now includes hundreds of European M.D.s as adherents, and that has its own hospitals and medical universities.

==Social Goals of Anthroposophy==
For a period after World War I, Steiner was extremely active and well-known in Germany in part because in many places he gave lectures on social questions.  A petition expressing his basic social ideas (signed by Herman Hesse, among others) was very widely circulated.   His main book on social questions, ''Die Kernpunkte der Sozialen Frage'' (available in English today as ''Toward Social Renewal'') sold tens of thousands of copies.  

Today around the world there are a number of innovative banks, companies, charitable institutions, and schools for developing new cooperative forms of business, all working partly out of Steiner&amp;#8217;s social ideas.  One example is The Rudolf Steiner Foundation, incorporated in 1984, and as of 2004 with estimated assets of $70 million.  RSF provides &quot;charitable innovative financial services&quot;.  According to the independent organizations Co-op America and the Social Investment Forum Foundation, RSF is &quot;one of the top 10 best organizations exemplifying the building of economic opportunity and hope for individuals through community investing.&quot;  The first bank founded out of Steiner's ideas was the ''Gemeinschaftsbank für Leihen und Schenken'' in [[Bochum]], [[Germany]]; it was started in 1974.

===Steiner's Outlook on Social History===
In Steiner's various writings and lectures he held that there were three main spheres of power comprising human society''':''' the cultural, the economic and the political.  In ancient times, those who had political power were also generally those with the greatest cultural/religious power and the greatest economic power.  Culture, State and Economy were fused (for example in ancient Egypt).  With the emergence of classical Greece and Rome, the three spheres began to become more autonomous.  This autonomy went on increasing over the centuries, and with the slow rise of egalitarianism and individualism, the failure adequately to separate economics, politics and culture was felt increasingly as a source of injustice.

Anthroposophy has its own concept of history: according to Steiner our present time falls into the post-[[Atlantean]] period, since in his view the disaster that he says hit Atlantis in [[7227 BC]] was a significant turning point in the history of man. This post-Atlantean period is divided by him into seven epochs, the current one being the European-American Epoch, which Steiner said would last until about the year [[3573]].

===Social Threefolding===
:''see full description in [[Social Threefolding]] article''.

There are three kinds of social separations Steiner wanted strengthened. This is known as [[Social Threefolding]] , 
# Increased separation between the State and cultural life 
# Increased separation between the economy and cultural life 
# Increased separation between the State and the economy (stakeholder economics)

==Aspects of Anthroposophic Thinking==
According to Steiner, a real [[spiritual]] world exists out of which the material one gradually condensed, and evolved.  The spiritual world, Steiner held, can in the right circumstances be researched through direct experience, by persons practicing rigorous forms of [[ethics|ethical]] and [[Cognition|cognitive]] [[Self-Discipline|self-discipline]].  Steiner described many exercises he said were suited to strengthening such self-discipline.  Details about the spiritual world, he said, could on such a basis be discovered and reported, not infallibly, but with approximate accuracy.  

Steiner regarded his research reports as being important aids to others seeking to enter into spiritual experience.  He suggested that a combination of spiritual exercises (for example, concentrating on an object such as a seed), moral development (control of thought, feelings and will combined with openness, tolerance and flexibility) and familiarity with other spiritual researchers' results would best further an individual's spiritual development.  He consistently emphasized that any inner, spiritual practice should be undertaken in such a way as not to interfere with one's responsibilities in outer life.  

Steiner often advised people avoid turning his work into a [[doctrine]].  He emphasized that any researcher, in any field, was able to make mistakes, and that both science and the world continued to evolve, making all results outdated after a certain time.

One of the central exercises of anthroposophy is to focus on a given content (this can be an outer object or a spiritual imagination) for a given time, and then to consciously eliminate the content from one's consciousness, allowing the process of attention to continue. We can become aware, thereby, of the activity of attention itself.  A further step is then to dismiss this activity from one's consciousness.  Behind the activity, Steiner suggested, would be found another level of spiritual reality. 

Some of Steiner's students support his claim that remaining actively within his process, can have the effect of awakening one gradually into forms of [[superconsciousness|superconscious]] spiritual awareness.  Steiner claims to offer a gradual experiential path from ordinary conceptual thinking into forms of thinking perceptive of living spiritual beings and mobile realities in the spiritual world.  

They claim that gaining access to the unusual forms of consciousness embodied in some of Steiner's works is not a matter of believing in or having faith in whatever Steiner chose to say about spiritual beings.  Rather, they claim that Steiner's thinking, if adequately penetrated with one's own active questioning, thinking and feeling, eventually reveals itself as a sort of spiritual music full of [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] tensions and relaxations and various kinds of spiritual dynamism. This spiritual dynamism, they see as full of complex [[metamorphosis|metamorphoses]] of form and color, and can itself eventually be perceived as the speaking and singing of living spiritual beings and of a real spiritual world.  

His students say that an obstacle to 'getting' Steiner, in this sense, is that reading for people today is rarely a process where the dynamic birth of a [[concept]] out of a pre-conceptual background is felt and recreated as we read each word.  They see one way of remaining within the process of Steiner's thinking, is to gradually learn through his works how to live consciously at the threshold where a concept comes into being. In this way they say, one is no longer confined to observing things that already are, instead one begins to see realities ''emerging'' into being, and that means seeing to some extent into 'non-being', and discovering there more than nothingness but a hidden life of creative non-material beings and processes in a non-material world.

==Successes of Anthroposophy==
Out of the anthroposophical movement have come nearly a thousand schools world-wide. These are often called [[Waldorf Schools]], after the first such school, founded in [[1919]]; they are also sometimes called Steiner Schools. Some have been supported by the United Nations and receive full or partial governmental funding in some European nations. They are successful in an unusual range of circumstances: in the impoverished ''barrios'' of San Paulo and the wealthy suburbs of New York City, in India, Egypt, Australia, Holland and Mexico. Usually supported by a vibrant parent community, they are one of the most visibly successful achievements of the anthroposophical movement. In addition, an increasing number of teachers are using 'Waldorf' principles in other school settings, often within the public (state) schools themselves.

[[Biodynamic agriculture]] began in the 1920s. Numerous bio-dynamic farms now exist in a great number of countries. Steiner must be counted as one of the two great founders of the modern [[organic farming]] movement (Steiner's ''Agriculture Course'' was the first published work on the subject), and much of the present-day organic movement can be traced back to people partially motivated by this impulse. Bio-dynamic agriculture emphasizes activating the life of the soil and creating each farm as a living organism that includes human beings, animals, plants and the soil.

Early in the twentieth century, when proper care for the handicapped was sadly ignored in many countries, anthroposophical homes and communities arose to give a worthy life-style to the needy. The first was the Sonnenhof in Switzerland, founded by [[Ita Wegman]]; slightly later, the [[Camphill Movement]] was founded by [[Karl Konig]] in Scotland. The latter in particular has spread widely, and there are now Camphill communities (as well as other anthroposophical homes) for both children and adults in many countries. 

In the arts, Steiner's new art of [[eurythmy]] gained early renown, gaining a prize at a pre-World War II World Exposition in Paris. Eurythmy is a renewal of the spiritual foundations of [[dance]], transforming speech and music into visible movement. There are now active stage groups and training centers, mostly of modest proportions, in many countries. 

John Wilkes' fountain-like Flow Forms can be found in many locations. These sculptural forms guide water into rhythmic movement, and are used both decoratively and for water purification in small to medium-scale applications. 

There are also movements to renew speech and drama. The former go back to the work of [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]]; among the better known of the latter is the approach founded by [[Michael Chekhov]], the nephew of the famous playwright: Anton Chekhov.

[[Bernard Lievegoed]] founded a new study of individual and institutional development; this is represented by the [[NPI Institute for Organisational Development]] in Holland and sister organizations in many other countries. Clients of these insitutions range from some of the world's largest industrial firms to ordinary people trying to understand their own lives. One of the more interesting areas of application has been in transforming impoverished people's lives by bringing them to recognize and begin to realize their own biographical goals. Social work with prisoners shares these goals and has had the effect of bringing new purpose into many lives.

Other fields of success include an original [[cancer]] therapy based on [[mistletoe]] extracts developed by anthroposophical researchers. This however reamins medically controversial. 

Anthroposophical [[banks]] were among the first to emphasize socially-responsible and community-based banking.

==Critiques of Anthroposophy==  
Some critics maintain that some anthroposophists tend to elevate Steiner's personal opinions to the level of absolute truths. Supporters claim that if there is a degree of truth to this criticism, most of the blame belongs not to Steiner, but to a few of his students. They point out that Steiner frequently asked that everything he said be tested by sound reason, and not to be taken on faith or authority. 

A fundamental question underlying the modern response to 'spiritual science' is: Is it possible for one's thinking to be both scientific and spiritually cognitive at once? Anthroposophy claims that this is possible.  This is problematic for those who hold that all spiritual experience is innately religious rather than cognitive. This question has actually been partially tested in the courts; in a 2005 court case, the Federal Court of California found that there was not a single piece of legally admissible evidence that Anthroposophy was in any sense a religion.

==Critical views==
Anthroposophy has had many prominent supporters. Among the supporters have been many writers, artists and musicians; these include [[Andrej Bely]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Josef Beuys]], and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. There have also been critical voices, however. The criticisms can be grouped thematically as follows:

-Criticisms of its claim to reproducibility and intersubjectivity, thus to a scientific foundation. 

-Criticisms that a spiritual movement must necessarily be, or that anthroposophy particularly is, religious in nature. (In a 2005 court case brought in California, however, the judge ruled that there is no legally admissible evidence that anthroposophy is a religion; see [http://www.waldorfanswers.org/TrialTranscript-2005-09-12.pdf transcipt of the  trial]; this case is under appeal.)

-Criticisms of some of Steiner's published comments for their apparently racist content; see the [http://uncletaz.com/steinerrace.html final report of the Commission on &quot;Anthroposophy and the Question of Race&quot;], which concludes that though by far the general trend of Steiner's thought, writings and lectures was strongly opposed to racism, a few of his stenographed comments certainly sound racist to modern ears.

The '''aurochs''' (''Bos primigenius'') is an [[extinct]] European [[mammal]] of the [[Bovidae]] family. The word ''aurochs'' is both singular and plural; alternative plural forms are ''aurochsen'' or ''urus''.  The animal's original scientific name, ''Bos primigenius'', translated the [[German language|German]] term ''Auerochse'' or ''Urochs'', literally &quot;primeval ox&quot;, or &quot;proto-ox&quot;. This scientific name is now considered invalid by [[ITIS]], who classify aurochs under ''Bos taurus'', the same species as domestic cattle. However, in 2003, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] &quot;conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are pre-dated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms&quot;, confirming ''Bos primigenius'' for the Aurochs. Taxonomists who consider  domesticated [[cattle]] a subspecies of the wild Aurochs should use ''B. primigenius taurus''; the name ''B. taurus'' remains available for domestic cattle where it is considered to be a separate species. 


==Origin==
According to the [[Paleontologisk Museum]], [[University of Oslo]], aurochs evolved in [[India]] some two million years ago, migrated into the [[Middle East]] and further into [[Asia]], and reached [[Europe]] about 250,000 years ago. They were once considered a distinct species from modern European [[cattle]] (''Bos taurus''), but more recent taxonomy has rejected this distinction. The South Asian domestic cattle, or [[zebu]], descended from a different group of aurochs at the edge of the [[Thar Desert]] in [[India]]; this would explain [[zebu]] resistance to [[drought]]. Domestic [[yak]], [[gayal]] and [[Javan cattle]] do not descend from aurochs. Modern cattle have become much smaller than their wild forebears: the height at the [[withers]] of a domesticated cow is about 1.4 meters, whereas an aurochs could reach about 1.75 meters.

At one time there existed three aurochs subspecies, namely ''Bos primigenius namadicus'' (Falconer, 1859) that occurred in India, the ''Bos primigenius mauretanicus'' (Thomas, 1881) from North Africa and naturally the ''Bos primigenius primigenius'' Bojanus, 1827 from Europe and the Middle East. Only the European subspecies has survived until in recent times.

==The worship of aurochs==
:''See also [[Bull (mythology)]].''

Aurochs are depicted in many Paleolithic European [[cave painting]]s such as those found at [[Lascaux]] and [[Livernon]] in [[France]]. Their life force may have been attributed with magical qualities, for early carvings of the aurochs have also been found. The impressive and dangerous aurochs survived into the [[Iron Age]] in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Near East]], and was worshiped throughout that area as a sacred animal, the [[Bull (mythology)|Lunar Bull]], associated with the [[Great Goddess]] and later with [[Mithras]].

A [[1999]] archaeological dig in [[Peterborough]], England, uncovered the skull of an aurochs. The front part of the skull had been removed but the horns remained attached. The supposition is that the killing of the aurochs in this instance was a sacrificial act.

The Aurochs were also the symbol of [[Moldavia]]; nowadays they can be found in the coat of arms of both [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]].

==Domestication and extinction==
Domestication of the aurochs began in the southern [[Caucasus]] and northern [[Mesopotamia]] from about the [[6th millennium BC]], while genetic evidence suggests that aurochs were independently domesticated in northern [[Africa]] and in [[India]]. Domestication caused dramatic changes to the physiology of the creatures, to the extent that domestic cattle must now be regarded as a separate species (see above). 

Genetic analysis has provided many insights about the aurochs. Though aurochs became extinct in Britain during the [[Bronze age]], analysis of bones from aurochs that lived contemporaneously with domesticated cattle there showed no genetic contribution to modern breeds. So modern European cattle are thought to be descended directly from the Near East domestication event. Indian cattle ([[zebu]]), although domesticated eight to ten thousand years ago, are related to aurochs which diverged from the Near Eastern ones some 200,000 years ago. The African cattle are thought to descend from aurochs more closely related to the Near Eastern ones. The Near East and African aurochs groups are thought to have split some 25,000 years ago, probably 15,000 years before domestication. The &quot;Turano-Mongolian&quot; type of cattle now found in Northern China, Mongolia, Korea and Japan may represent a fourth domestication event (and a third event among ''Bos taurus''&amp;ndash;type aurochs). This group may have diverged from the Near East group some 35,000 years ago. Whether these separate genetic populations would have equated to separate subspecies is unclear.

The original range of the aurochs was from the British Isles, to Africa, the Middle East, India and central Asia. By the 13th century A.D., the aurochs' range was restricted to Poland, Lithuania and East Prussia. The right to hunt large animals on any land was restricted to nobles and gradually to the royal household. As the population of aurochs declined, hunting ceased but the royal court still required gamekeepers to provide open fields for the aurochs to graze in. The gamekeepers were exempted from local taxes in exchange for their service and a decree made poaching an aurochs punishable by death. In 1564, the gamekeepers knew of only 38 animals, according to the royal survey. The last recorded live aurochs (female) died in [[1627]] in the Jaktorów Forest, [[Poland]].

In the [[1920s]] two German zookeepers, the brothers Heinz and Lutz Heck, attempted to breed the aurochs back into existence (see [[Breeding_back|breeding back]]) from the domestic cattle that were their descendants. Their plan was based on the conception that a species is not extinct as long as all its genes are still present in a living population. The result is the breed called [[Heck Cattle]], 'Recreated Aurochs', or 'Heck Aurochs', which bears an incomplete resemblance to what is known about the physiology of the wild aurochs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Asynchronous Transfer Mode''', or '''ATM''' for short, is a [[cell relay]] [[network protocol]] which encodes data traffic into small fixed-sized (53 byte; 48 bytes of data and 5 bytes of header information) cells instead of variable sized ''packets'' as in [[packet switching|packet-switched networks]] (such as the [[Internet Protocol]] or [[Ethernet]]). It is a [[connection-oriented]] technology, in which a connection is established between the two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.

==Introduction==
ATM was intended to provide a single unified networking standard that could support both [[Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Signalling|synchronous]] channel networking ([[PDH]], [[SDH]]) and packet-based networking ([[Internet Protocol|IP]], [[Frame relay]], etc), whilst supporting multiple levels of [[quality of service]] for packet traffic.

ATM sought to resolve the conflict between [[circuit switching|circuit-switched]] networks and [[packet switching|packet-switched]] networks by mapping both bitstreams and packet-streams onto a stream of small fixed-size 'cells' tagged with [[virtual circuit]] identifiers. The cells are typically sent on demand within a synchronous time-slot pattern in a synchronous bit-stream: what is asynchronous here is the sending of the cells, not the low-level bitstream that carries them.

In its original conception, ATM was to be the enabling technology of the 'Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network' ([[B-ISDN]]) that would replace the existing [[PSTN]]. The full suite of ATM standards provides definitions for [[physical layer|layer 1]] (physical connections), [[data link layer|layer 2]] (data link layer) and [[network layer|layer 3]] (network) of the classical [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI]] [[OSI model|seven-layer networking model]]. The ATM standards drew on concepts from the telecommunications community, rather than the computer networking community. For this reason, extensive provision was made for integration of most existing [[Telephone company|telco]] technologies and conventions into ATM. 

As a result, ATM provides a highly complex technology, with features intended for applications ranging from global telco networks to private local area computer networks. ATM has been a partial success as a technology, with widespread deployment, but generally only used as a transport for IP traffic; its goal of providing a single integrated technology for LANs, public networks, and user services has largely failed.

== Successes and Failures of ATM Technology ==
Numerous [[telephone company|telco]]s have implemented wide-area ATM networks, and many [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line|ADSL]] implementations use ATM. However, ATM has failed to gain wide use as a [[Local area network|LAN]] technology, and its great complexity has held back its full deployment as the single integrating network technology in the way that its inventors originally intended.

Many people, particularly in the Internet protocol-design community, considered this vision to be mistaken.  Their argument went something like this:  We know that there will always be both brand-new and obsolescent link-layer technologies, particularly in the LAN area, and it is fair to assume that not all of them will fit neatly into the [[SDH]] model that ATM was designed for.  Therefore, some sort of protocol is needed to provide a unifying layer over both ATM and non-ATM link layers, and ATM itself cannot fill that role.  Conveniently, we have this protocol called &quot;IP&quot; which already does that.  Ergo, there is no point in implementing ATM at the network layer.

In addition, the need for cells to reduce jitter has disappeared as transport speeds increased (see below), and improvements in [[voice over IP]] have made the integration of speech and data possible at the IP layer, again removing the incentive for ubiquitous deployment of ATM. Most telcos are now planning to integrate their voice network activities into their IP networks, rather than their IP networks into the voice infrastructure.

Many technically sound ideas from ATM were adopted by [[MPLS]], a generic [[Layer 2]] packet switching protocol. ATM remains widely deployed, and is used as a [[multiplexing]] service in [[Digital Subscriber Line|DSL]] networks, where its compromises fit DSL's low-data-rate needs well. In turn, DSL networks support IP (and IP services such as VoIP) via [[Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM|PPP over ATM]]. 

ATM will remain deployed for some time in higher-speed interconnects where carriers have already committed themselves to existing ATM deployments; ATM is used here as a way of unifying [[PDH]]/SDH traffic and packet-switched traffic under a single infrastructure.

However, ATM is increasingly challenged by speed and traffic shaping requirements of [[converged networks]]. In particular, the complexity of [[Segmentation and Reassembly|SAR]] imposes a performance bottleneck, as the fastest SARs known run at 2.5 Gbit/s and have limited traffic shaping capabilities.

Currently it seems like [[Ethernet]] implementations (10Gbit-Ethernet, [[MetroEthernet]]) will
replace ATM in many locations.
Enables convergence of Voice, Video, Data on one network

== Recent Developments ==
Interest in using native ATM for carrying live video and audio has increased recently. In these environments, low latency and very high quality of service are required to handle linear audio and video streams.  Towards this goal standards are being developed such as [[AES47]] ([[IEC 62365]]), which would compete with [[professional video over IP]].

==ATM Concepts==
===Why Cells?===
The motivation for the use of small data ''cells'' was the reduction of [[jitter]] (delay variance, in this case) in the multiplexing of data streams; reduction of this (and also end-to-end round-trip delays) is particularly important when carrying voice traffic.

This is because the conversion of digitized voice back into an analog audio signal is an inherently [[real time|real-time]] process, and to do a good job, the [[codec]] that does this needs an evenly spaced (in time) stream of data items. If the next data item is not available when it is needed, the codec has no choice but to produce silence - and if the data does arrive, but late, it is useless, because the time period when it should have been converted to a signal has already passed.

Now consider a speech signal reduced to packets, and forced to share a link with bursty data traffic (i.e. some of the data packets will be large). No matter how small the speech packets could be made, they would always encounter full-size data packets, and under normal queuing conditions, might experience maximum queuing delays.

At the time ATM was designed, 155 Mbit/s [[SDH]] (135 Mbit/s payload) was considered a fast optical network link, and many [[PDH]] links in the digital network were considerably slower, ranging from 1.544 to 45 Mbit/s in the USA (2 to 34 Mbit/s in Europe).

At this rate, a typical full-length 1500 byte (12000 bit) data packet would take 89 [[microsecond|µs]] to transmit. In a lower-speed link, such as a 1.544 Mbit/s T1 link, a 1500 byte packet would take up to 7.8 milliseconds. 

A queueing delay induced by several such data packets might be several times the figure of 7.8 ms, in addition to any packet generation delay in the shorter speech packet. This was clearly unacceptable for speech traffic, which needs to have low jitter in the data stream being fed into the codec if it is to produce good-quality sound. A packet voice system can produce this in a number of ways:

* Have a playback buffer between the network and the codec, one large enough to tide the codec over almost all the jitter in the data. This allows smoothing out the jitter, but the delay introduced by passage through the buffer would be such that echo cancellers would be required even in local networks; this was considered too expensive at the time. Also, it would have increased the delay across the channel, and human conversational mechanisms tend not to work well with high-delay channels.

* Build a system which can inherently provide low-jitter (and minimal overall delay) to traffic which needs it.

* Operate on a 1:1 user basis (i.e., a dedicated pipe).

ATM was designed to implement a low-jitter network interface. However, to be able to provide short queueing delays, but also be able to carry large datagrams, it had to have cells. ATM broke all packets, data, and voice streams up into 48-byte chunks, adding a 5-byte routing header to each one so that they could be reassembled later. It multiplexed these 53-byte cells instead of packets. Doing so reduced the worst-case queuing jitter by a factor of almost 30, removing the need for echo cancellers.

===Cells In Practice===
The rules for segmenting and reassembling packets and streams into cells are known as [[ATM Adaptation Layers]].  The most important two are AAL 1, used for streams, and [[ATM Adaptation Layer 5|AAL 5]], used for most types of packets. Which AAL is in use for a given cell is not encoded in the cell. Instead, it is negotiated by or configured at the endpoints on a per-virtual-connection basis.

Since ATM was designed, networks have become much faster. As of 2001, a 1500 byte (12000 bit) full-size Ethernet packet will take only 1.2 µs to transmit on a 10 Gbit/s optical network, removing the need for small cells to reduce jitter. Some consider that this removes the need for ATM in the network backbone. Additionally, the hardware for implementing the service adaptation for IP packets is expensive at very high speeds. Specifically, the cost of segmentation and reassembly (SAR) hardware at [[OC-3]] and above speeds makes ATM less competitive for IP than [[Packet over SONET/SDH|Packet Over SONET]] (POS). SAR performance limits mean that the fastest IP router ATM interfaces are OC12 - OC48 (STM4 - STM16), while (as of 2004) POS can operate at OC-192 (STM64) with higher speeds expected in the future.

On slow links (2 Mbit/s and below) ATM still makes sense, and this is why so many ADSL systems use ATM as an intermediate layer between the physical link layer and a Layer 2 protocol like PPP or Ethernet. 

At these lower speeds, ATM's ability to carry multiple logical circuits on a single physical or virtual medium provides a compelling business advantage. DSL can be used as an access method for an ATM network, allowing a DSL termination point in a telephone central office to connect to many internet service providers across a wide-area ATM network. In the United States, at least, this has allowed DSL providers to provide DSL access to the customers of many internet service providers. Since one DSL termination point can support multiple ISPs, the economic feasibility of DSL is substantially improved.

===Why Virtual Circuits?===
ATM is a channel based transport layer. This is encompassed in the concept of the Virtual Path (VP) and Virtual Circuit (VC). Every ATM cell has an 8- or 12-bit Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) and 16-bit Virtual Circuit Identifer (VCI) pair defined in its header. The length of the VPI varies according to whether the cell is sent on the user-network interface (on the edge of the network), or if it is sent on the network-network interface (inside the network).

As these cells traverse an ATM network, switching is achieved by changing the VPI/VCI values. Although the VPI/VCI values are not necessarily consistent from one end of the connection to the other, the concept of a circuit ''is'' consistent (unlike IP, where any given packet could get to its destination by a different route than the others).

Another advantage of the use of virtual circuits is the ability to use them as a multiplexing layer, allowing different services (such as voice, [[Frame relay|Frame Relay]], n*64 channels, IP, [[Systems Network Architecture|SNA]], etc.) to share a common ATM connection without interfering with one another.

===Using Cells and Virtual Circuits For Traffic Engineering===
Another key ATM concept is that of the traffic contract. When an ATM circuit is set up each switch is informed of the traffic class of the connection.

ATM traffic contracts are part of the mechanism by which &quot;[[Quality of Service]]&quot; (QoS) is ensured. There are three basic types (and several variants) which each have a set of parameters describing the connection.

* CBR - Constant bit rate: you specify a Peak Cell Rate (PCR), which is constant.
* VBR - Variable bit rate: you specify an average cell rate, which can peak at a certain level for a maximum interval before being problematic.
* ABR - Available bit rate: you specify a minimum guaranteed rate.
* UBR - Unspecified bit rate: your traffic is allocated all remaining transmission capacity.

VBR has [[Real-time|real-time]] and non-real-time variants, and is used for &quot;bursty&quot; traffic.

Most traffic classes also introduce the concept of Cell Delay Variation Time (CDVT) which defines the &quot;clumping&quot; of cells in time.

Traffic contracts are usually maintained by the use of &quot;Shaping&quot;, a combination of queuing and marking of cells, and enforced by &quot;Policing&quot;.

====Traffic Shaping====
[[Traffic shaping]] is usually done at the entry point to an ATM network and attempts to ensure that the cell flow will meet its traffic contract.

====Traffic Policing====
To maintain network performance it is possible to police virtual circuits against their traffic contracts. If a circuit is exceeding its traffic contract, the network can either drop the cells or mark the Cell Loss Priority (CLP) bit (to identify a cell as discardable further down the line). Basic policing works on a cell by cell basis, but this is sub-optimal for encapsulated packet traffic (as discarding a single cell will invalidate the whole packet). As a result, schemes such as Partial Packet Discard (PPD) and Early Packet Discard (EPD) have been created that will discard a whole series of cells until the next frame starts. This reduces the number of redundant cells in the network, saving bandwidth for full frames. EPD and PPD work with AAL5 connections as they use the frame end bit to detect the end of packets.

===Types of Virtual Circuits and Paths===
Virtual circuits and virtual paths can be built statically or dynamically. Static circuits (permanent virtual circuits or PVCs) or paths (permanent virtual paths or PVPs) require that the provisioner must build the circuit as a series of segments, one for each pair of interfaces through which it passes. 

PVPs and PVCs are conceptually simple, but require significant effort in large networks. They also do not support the re-routing of service in the event of a failure. Dynamically built PVPs (soft PVPs or SPVPs) and PVCs (soft PVCs or SPVCs), in contrast, are built by specifying the characteristics of the circuit (the service &quot;contract&quot;) and the two endpoints. 

Finally, switched virtual circuits (SVCs) are built and torn down on demand when requested by an end piece of equipment. One application for SVCs is to carry individual telephone calls when a network of telephone switches are inter-connected by ATM. SVCs were also used in attempts to replace local area networks with ATM.

===Virtual Circuit Routing and Call Admission===
Most ATM networks supporting SPVPs, SPVCs, and SVCs use the Private Network Node Interface or Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI) protocol. PNNI uses the same shortest path first algorithm used by [[Open Shortest Path First|OSPF]] and [[IS-IS]] to route IP packets to share topology information between switches and select a route through a network. PNNI also includes a very powerful summarization mechanism to allow construction of very large networks, as well as a call admission control (CAC) algorithm that determines whether sufficient bandwidth is available on a proposed route through a network to satisfy the service requirements of a VC or VP.

==Structure of An ATM Cell==
An ATM cell consists of a 5 byte header and a 48 byte payload. The payload size of 48 bytes was a compromise between the needs of voice telephony and packet networks, obtained by a simple averaging of the US proposal of 64 bytes and European proposal of 32, said by some to be motivated by a European desire not to need echo-cancellers on national trunks.

ATM defines two different cell formats: NNI (Network-network interface) and UNI (User-network interface). Most ATM links use UNI cell format.

 GFC = [[Generic Flow Control]] (4 bits) (default: 4-zero bits)
 VPI = [[Virtual Path Identifier]] (8 bits UNI) or (12 bits NNI)
 VCI = [[Virtual Channel Identifier]] (16 bits)
 PT  = [[Payload Type]] (3 bits)
 CLP = [[Cell Loss Priority]] (1 bit)
 HEC = [[Header Error Correction]] (8bits) (checksum of header only)

The PT field is used to designate various special kinds of cells for [[Operation and Management]] (OAM) purposes, and to delineate packet boundaries in some AALs.

Several of ATM's link protocols use the HEC field to drive a [[CRC-Based Framing]] algorithm which allows the position of the ATM cells to be found with no overhead required beyond what is otherwise needed for header protection.

In a UNI cell the GFC field is reserved for an (as yet undefined) local flow control/submultiplexing system between network and user. All four GFC bits must be zero by default. 

The NNI cell format is almost identical to the UNI format, except that the 4 bit GFC field is re-allocated to the VPI field, extending the VPI to 12 bits. Thus, a single NNI ATM interconnection is capable of addressing almost 2&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; VPs of up to almost 2&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; VCs each
(in practice some of the VP and VC numbers are reserved).

{{about|the bodily orifice|the New Guinea tribal language|[[Anus language]]}}
{{Redirect|Anal}}

In [[anatomy]], the '''anus''' (from [[Latin]] ānus &quot;ring, anus&quot;) is the external opening of the [[rectum]]. Closure is controlled by [[sphincter]] [[muscle]]s. [[Feces]] are expelled from the body through the anus during the act of [[defecation]], which is the primary function of the anus. Most animals &amp;mdash; from simple worms to elephants and humans &amp;mdash; have a tubular [[gut]], with a [[mouth]] at one end and an anus at the other.

The anus is often considered a [[taboo]] part of the body, and is also known by a large number of slang terms, which are generally considered vulgar and not used in polite speech.

== Structure ==
The human anus is situated between the [[buttock]]s, [[posterior]] to the [[perineum]]. It has two anal sphincters, one internal, the other external. These hold the anus closed until time to defecate.&lt;!-- or time for sexual activity.--&gt; One sphincter consists of smooth muscle and its action is involuntary; the other consists of striated muscle and its action is voluntary. In many animals, the anus is surrounded by [[anal sacs]].

== Role in defecation ==
{{main|Defecation}}

When the [[rectum]] is full the increase in intrarectal pressure forces the walls of the [[anal canal]] apart allowing the fecal matter to enter the canal. The rectum shortens as material is forced into the anal canal and peristaltic waves propel the feces out of the rectum. The internal and external sphincters of the anus allow the feces to be passed by muscles pulling the anus up over the exiting feces.

To prevent diseases of the anus and to promote general hygiene, humans often follow the action of the sphincter with a cleansing activity after emptying the bowels. A wash with a [[bidet]] or a wiping with [[toilet paper]] are often used to clear the anus of fecal matter.

== Role in sexuality ==
{{main|Anal sex}}

The anus has a relatively high concentration of [[nerve ending]]s and is an [[erogenous zone]]. [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[psychosexual development]], for example, described  an [[anal stage]], hypothesizing that toddlers derive pleasure from retaining and expelling feces. This is the source of the [[derogatory]] term [[anal-retentive]].

Anal intercourse can be pleasurable for both the insertive partner and the receptive partner. For females, pleasure from anal intercourse is also thought to be related to the shared wall between the rectum and the [[vagina]] as well as the [[G-spot]]. For males, the tightness of the anus is often said to be a source of pleasure in penetrative anal sex, while the presence of the [[prostate]] gland near the rectal wall is generally seen as a source of pleasure during receptive anal intercourse. Other animals have also been observed practicing anal intercourse. 

Anal intercourse, sometimes referred to as [[sodomy]] or [[buggery]], is a common human sexual activity, but is considered [[taboo]] in a number of moral systems, and it has been, and in some jurisdictions continues to be, a crime carrying severe punishment. 

Anal sex need not include penetration. The anus also plays an important role in [[face sitting]], [[coprophilia]] and [[anilingus]].

[[Anal stretching]] can stimulate the nerves around the anus and can be considered pleasurable. Care must be taken to maintain elasticity.

==Maintenance==

[[Image:Human female anus.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Female human anus, bordered by the [[buttock]]s and [[perineum]].]]

Hygiene is important for good anal health. Washing with a mild soap and water will keep the anus clean. Harsh soaps or wiping vigorously with toilet paper can irritate the skin around the anus, making it itchy or sore. [[pinworm|Pinworms]] are sometimes the source of [[anal itching]].

Care should be taken not to strip the anus of natural oils that keep the skin around the opening supple and elastic.

Penetration with a penis or sex toy can irritate or tear the inside of the anus. Lubrication is often recommended to ease penetration.

[[Kegel exercise]]s can improve the tone of the outer sphincter muscle.

==Cosmetics==
Shaving, trimming, [[depilatory]], or [[Brazilian waxing]] can clear the perineum of hair.

[[Anal bleaching]] is a relatively new [[West coast]] phenomenon where the perineum, which darkens over the years, is lightened for a more youthful appearance. In April 2000, gossip columnist [[Ted Casablanca]] reported that actresses including [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] have had their anuses bleached. [http://www.eonline.com/Gossip/Awful/cauth/Archive2000/000427b.html]

[[Anal piercing]] is among the more extreme piercings and usually interferes with the function of the anus.

== Pathology ==
[[Anal cancer]], [[abscess]], [[warts]], [[fistula]], [[fissure]], [[itching]] and [[hemorrhoids]] are among the diseases of the anus that benefit from medical intervention. Birth defects of the anus include [[stenosis]] and [[Imperforate anus|imperforation]]. The anus is also a frequent site of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.
Damaged [[anal sphincter]] ([[patulous anus]] in more severe cases) – caused by careless surgery in the [[perineal]] region or by rough/abrupt penetration in [[anal sex]] – can lead to [[flatus]] and/or [[fecal incontinence]], chronic [[constipation]] and, ultimately, [[megacolon]].

The '''Acantharea''' are a small group of [[radiolaria]]n [[protozoa]], distinguished mainly by their skeletons.  These are composed of [[strontium sulfate]] crystals, which do not [[fossil]]ize, and take the form of either ten diametric or twenty radial spines.  The central capsule is made up of [[microfibril]]s arranged into twenty  plates, each with a hole through which one spine projects, and there is also a microfibrillar cortex linked to the spines by [[myonemes]].  These assist in flotation, together with the [[vacuole]]s in the ectoplasm, which often contain [[zooxanthella]]e.

The arrangement of the spines is very precise, and is described by what is called the Müllerian law.  This is easiest to describe in terms of lines of latitude and longitude - the spines lie on the intersections between five of the former, symmetric about an equator, and eight of the latter, spaced uniformly.  Each line of longitude carries either two ''tropical'' spines or one ''equatorial'' and two ''polar'' spines, in alternation.  The way that the spines are joined together at the center of the cell varies and is one of the primary characteristics by which acanthareans are classified.

* [[Holacanthida]] - diametric spines, simply crossed
* [[Symphyacanthida]] - radial spines, with free bases
* [[Chaunacanthida]] - radial spines, with articulated bases
* [[Arthracanthida]] - radial spines, with pyramidal bases packed together

The axopods are fixed in number.  Reproduction takes place by formation of [[spore]]s, which may be [[flagellate]].  These develop into [[cell nucleus|mononucleate]] amoebae; adults are usually multinucleate.

The '''African National Congress''' (ANC) is a centre-[[left-wing politics|left]] [[political party]], and has been [[South Africa]]'s governing party supported by a [[tripartite alliance]] between itself, the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]] (COSATU) and the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP) since the establishment of majority rule in May 1994. Originally called the '''South African Native National Congress''' until 1923, it was founded to defend the rights of the black majority on [[8 January]] [[1912]] in [[Bloemfontein]], and counted [[John Dube]] (its first president) and poet and author [[Sol Plaatje]] among its founder members.


It has been the only party to rule South Africa since 1994.  It gained support in the [[South African general election, 1999|1999 elections]], and further increased its majority in [[South African general election, 2004|2004]].

==History==
{{Politics of South Africa}}
Formed initially on [[January 8th]], [[1912]] by [[John Dube]], [[Pixley Seme]] and [[Sol Plaatje]]  along with chiefs, representatives of people's and church organisations, and other prominent individuals to bring all Africans together as one people to defend their rights and freedoms, the ANC from its inception represented both traditional and modern elements, from tribal chiefs to church and community bodies and educated black professionals, though women were only admitted as affiliate members from 1931 and as full members in 1943.

The formation of the [[African National Congress Youth League|ANC Youth League]] in 1944 by [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Walter Sisulu]], and [[Oliver Tambo]] heralded a new generation committed to building non-violent mass action against the legal underpinnings of the white minority's supremacy. In 1947 the ANC allied with the [[Natal Indian Congress]] and [[Transvaal Indian Congress]], broadening the basis of its opposition to the government.

The return of an [[Afrikaner]]-led [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government by the overwhelmingly white electorate in 1948 signaled the advent of the policy of [[History of South Africa in the Apartheid Era|apartheid]]. During the 1950s, non-whites were removed from electoral rolls, residence and mobility laws were tightened and political activities restricted.

In June 1952, the ANC joined with other anti-apartheid organisations in a [[Defiance Campaign]] against the restriction of political, labour and residential rights, during which protesters deliberately violated oppressive laws, following the example of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s [[passive resistance]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] and [[India]]. The campaign was called off in April 1953 after new laws prohibiting protest meetings were passed.

In June 1955, the [[Congress of the People]], organised by the ANC and Indian, Coloured and White organizations at Kliptown near [[Johannesburg]], adopted the [[Freedom Charter]], henceforth the fundamental document of the anti-apartheid struggle with its demand for equal rights for all regardless of race. As opposition to the regime's policies continued, 156 leading members of the ANC and allied organisations were arrested in 1956; the resulting &quot;[[Treason Trial]]&quot; ended with their acquittal five years later.

In 1959, a number of members broke away from the ANC because they objected to the ANC's reorientation from [[African nationalist]] policies. They formed the rival [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC), led by [[Robert Sobukwe]].

===Protest and banning===
The ANC planned a campaign against the [[dompas|Pass Laws]], which required [[blacks]] to carry an [[identity card]] at all times to justify their presence in &quot;white&quot; areas, to begin on [[31 March]] [[1960]]. The PAC pre-empted the ANC by holding peaceful protests [[21 March|10 days earlier]], during which 69 protesters were killed and 180 injured by police fire in what became known as the [[Sharpeville massacre]].

In the aftermath of the tragedy, both organisations were banned from [[political dissent|political activity]]. The ANC subsequently went underground and increased their violent protest actions to include operations some have described as [[terrorism]]. 

International opposition to the regime increased throughout the 1950s and 1960s, fueled by the growing number of newly independent nations, the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] in Britain
and the [[civil rights movement]] in the [[United States]]. In 1960, the leader of the ANC, [[Albert Lutuli]], won the [[Nobel Prize/Peace|Nobel Peace Prize]], a feat that would be repeated in 1993 by [[Nelson Mandela]].

===Violent political resistance===
Now underground or in exile, the ANC leadership concluded that the methods of non-violence such as those utilised by [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] against the [[British Empire]] during their colonisation of [[India]], were not suitable against the no less brutal but effective apartheid system. It was decided that [[military]] tactics had to be used, which primarily involved targeting and [[sabotage|sabotaging]] the government's resources, with a philosophy of avoiding bloodshed at all costs.  A military wing was formed in 1961, called [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]], meaning &quot;Spear of the Nation&quot;. However, Mandela, as its first leader, was arrested for terrorism in 1962 and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 on [[Robben Island]], along with Sisulu and other ANC leaders after the [[Rivonia Trial]].

Almost thirty years passed, with international pressure and internal dissent mounting in the country.  With the situation becoming ever more untenable, [[State President of South Africa|State President]] [[Frederik Willem de Klerk|F.W. de Klerk]] unbanned the ANC and PAC on [[2 February]] [[1990]].

==Coming to power==
In April 1994, in a tripartite alliance with the [[South African Communist Party]] and the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]], the ANC won a landslide victory in the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general election]], and [[Nelson Mandela]] was elected the first [[President of South Africa]].

In [[Kwa-Zulu Natal]], the ANC maintained an uneasy [[coalition]] with the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] after neither party won a majority in the [[South African general election, 1994|1994]] and [[South African general election, 1999|1999]] provincial elections. 

In 2004, the party contested national elections in voluntary coalition with the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]] (NNP), which it effectively absorbed following the NNP's dissolution in 2005.

After the 1994 and 1999 elections, it ruled seven of the nine provinces, with [[Kwa-Zulu Natal]] under the IFP and the [[Western Cape Province]] under the NNP. As of 2004, it gained both the Western Cape and Kwa-Zulu Natal after a combination of the NNP's electoral base being eroded by the DA and a poor showing by the IFP.

By 2001, the [[tripartite alliance]] between the ANC, COSATU and SACP began showing signs of strain as the ANC moved to more liberal economic policies than its alliance partners were comfortable with. The focus for dissent was the [[GEAR]] program, an [[initialism]] for &quot;Growth, Employment and Redistribution.&quot;

In late 2004, this was again thrown into sharp relief by [[Zwelinzima Vavi]] of COSATU protesting the ANC's policy of &quot;quiet diplomacy&quot; towards the worsening conditions in [[Zimbabwe]], as well as [[Black Economic Empowerment]], which he complained benefits a favoured few in the black elite and not the masses.

As of [[2005]], the alliance was facing a crisis as [[Jacob Zuma]], who was fired from his position as [[Deputy President of South Africa]] by Thabo Mbeki, faced [[political corruption|corruption]] charges. Complicating the situation was the fact that Zuma remained Deputy President of the ANC, and maintained a strong following amongst many ANC supporters, and the ANC's alliance partners [http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20051016093406344C153857]. In October [[2005]], top officials in the [[National Intelligence Agency]], who were Zuma supporters, were suspended for illegally spying on an Mbeki supporter, [[Saki Macozoma]], amid allegations that ANC supporters were using their positions within organs of state to spy on, and discredit each other[http://www.sundayindependent.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=2962595] [http://www.sundaytimes.co.za/articles/article.aspx?ID=ST6A156220]. In December 2005, Zuma was charged with [[rape]] and his position as Deputy President of the ANC was suspended. [http://allafrica.com/stories/200512070314.html]

The ANC also faced (sometimes violent) protests in [[township (South Africa)|townships]] over perceived poor service delivery, as well as internal disputes, as [[South African local government elections, 2006|local government elections]] approached in [[2006]]. [http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=261817&amp;area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/] [http://www.capeargus.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=49&amp;fArticleId=3074657].

===Party List===
Politicians in the party win a place in parliament by being on the ''Party List'', which is drawn up before the elections and enumerates, in order, the party's preferred MPs. The number of seats allocated is proportional to the popular national vote, and this determines the cut-off point.

The ANC has also gained members through the controversial [[floor crossing (South Africa)|floor crossing]] process.

==Key personalities within the ANC==
&lt;!--please list alphabetically by surname--&gt;
* Before 1948: [[John Dube]], [[Sol Plaatje]], [[Pixley ka Isaka Seme]]
* 1948 to 1994: [[Chris Hani]], [[Ahmed Kathrada]], [[Albert Lutuli]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Govan Mbeki]], [[Thabo Mbeki]], [[Raymond Mhlaba]], [[Cyril Ramaphosa]], [[Walter Sisulu]], [[Joe Slovo]], [[Robert Sobukwe]], [[Oliver Tambo]]
* After 1994: Nelson Mandela, [[Sydney Mufamadi]], Thabo Mbeki, [[Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka]], [[Tokyo Sexwale]], [[Jacob Zuma]]

==Criticism==
[[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]] in his [[Nelson Mandela]] speech in 2004 criticized the ''Party List'' system as discouraging debate and encouraging patronage within the party. He also singled out business deals that favour the &quot;recycled few&quot; in [[Black Economic Empowerment]] deals instead of the poor majority.

Another accusation frequently levelled against them is that they protect their high-ranking members in the face of [[South African political scandals|controversy]], and is seen as supporting criminal behaviour.  Recent issues of this nature include the [[Schabir Shaik]] fraud trial linked to Deputy President [[Jacob Zuma]], the sexual misconduct and criminal charges of [[Beaufort West Municipality, Western Cape|Beaufort West]] municipal manager [[Truman Prince]] (see [http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1700232,00.html]), and the [[Oilgate]] scandal, in which millions of Rand in funds from a state-owned company were allegedly funneled into ANC coffers [http://www.mg.co.za/specialreport.aspx?area=oilgate]. Links between factions in the ANC and businessman [[Brett Kebble]] gained media attention following Kebble's murder in September [[2005]].

'''Amphetamine''' ('''a'''lpha-'''m'''ethyl-[[phenethylamine|'''ph'''en'''et'''hyl'''amine''']]), also known as '''speed''', is a synthetic [[stimulant]] used to [[anorectic|suppress the appetite]], control weight, and treat disorders including [[narcolepsy]] and [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]]. It is also used recreationally and for performance enhancement (these uses are illegal in most countries). 

Due to the widespread use of amphetamines as a treatment for [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD/ADHD]] in the [[USA]], Canada, and other countries, they frequently find their way onto the street and are one of the most frequently-abused drugs in high schools and colleges. 

Patients with acute toxicity from amphetamines may have symptoms of lock-jaw, diarrhea, [[palpitations]], [[arrhythmia]], [[fainting|syncope]], [[hyperpyrexia]], and [[hyperreflexia]] progressing to [[convulsion]]s and [[coma]].
Patients with chronic use of amphetamines develop a rapid tolerance to the drug and may have to increase the number of pills to reach a desired affect and eventually develop addiction. 
Patients that develop addiction show symptoms of restlessness, [[anxiety]], [[depression]], [[insomnia]], and suicidal behavior. 
A urine drug screen can be performed to determine the presence of amphetamines. 
Patients may need to be hospitalized. 
Supportive therapy is important. 
Cooling blankets may be used for [[hyperthermia]]. 
[[sedative|Sedation]] may be obtained with [[lorazepam]] or [[diazepam]]. 
[[Haloperidol]] may be given for agitation and [[delusion]]s. 
[[Hypertension]] and arrhythmias should be treated. 

== Pharmacology ==
'''Amphetamine''' is a synthetic [[Medication|drug]] with strong stimulant effects.  In the United States, it is most commonly used for treatment of attention-deficit disorders and narcolepsy, but is also approved as a weight-loss medication in certain cases of obesity.  Within the armed forces only, it is also frequently prescribed as an anti-fatigue pill for pilots and other individuals in situations requiring vigilance and alertness.  Amphetamine is also used illegally to take advantage of these effects.

The term ''amphetamine'' causes a certain amount of confusion because it is often used incorrectly.  In the general sense, amphetamine can describe other drugs with similar, stimulant effects, namely [[methamphetamine]] and [[methylphenidate]].  Chemists often use the term &quot;amphetamine class&quot; to describe chemicals that are structurally similar (and often similar in effect as well) to amphetamine - namely, chemicals with an ethyl backbone, terminal phenyl and amine groups, and a methyl group adjacent to the amine.  A large number of chemicals fall into this category, including the club drug [[MDMA]] ([[Ecstasy (drug)|Ecstasy]]) and methamphetamine. It is important to note that such an &quot;amphetamine class&quot; does not technically exist.  In the pharmacodynamic sense, these drugs all fall under the umbrella of central nervous system stimulants; in the chemical sense, they are [[phenylethylamines]]. Amphetamine, for example, is methylated phenylethylamine, and methamphetamine is double-methylated phenylethylamine.

Amphetamine traditionally comes in the salt-form ''amphetamine sulfate'' and is comprised of 50% l-amphetamine and 50% d-amphetamine (where ''l-'' and ''d-'' refer to ''levo'' and ''dextro'', the two optical orientations the amphetamine structure can have).  In the United States, pharmaceutical products containing solely amphetamine (for example, Biphetamine) are no longer manufactured.  Today, dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine) sulphate is the predominant form of the drug used; it consists entirely of d-isomer amphetamine, which acts in a slightly different way on the brain than does l-amphetamine.  Attention disorders are often treated using '''[[Adderall]]''' or generic-equivalent formulations of mixed amphetamine salts that contain both d/l-amphetamine and d-amphetamine in the sulfate and saccharate forms mixed to a final ratio of 3 parts d-amphetamine to 1 part l-amphetamine.

Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 by the [[Romania|Romanian]] [[Chemist]] [[Lazar Edeleanu]], who called it '''&quot;phenylisopropylamine&quot;'''.

==Medicinal use==
The experimental medical use of amphetamines began in the [[1920s]].  It was introduced in most of the world in the form of the pharmaceutical '''[[Benzedrine]]''' in the late-[[1920s]].  The drug was used by the militaries of several nations, especially the air forces, to fight fatigue and increase alertness among servicemen.  After decades of reports of abuse, the [[United States Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] banned Benzedrine inhalers, and limited amphetamines to prescription use in 1959, but illegal use became common. 

Along with [[methylphenidate]] ([[Ritalin]] [[Concerta]]), amphetamine is one of the standard treatments for [[ADHD]]. Beneficial effects for ADHD can include improved impulse control, improved concentration, decreased sensory overstimulation, and decreased irritability. These effects can be dramatic, particularly in young children. The ADHD medication [[Adderall]] is composed of four different amphetamine [[salt]]s, [[Adderall XR]] is a timed release formulation of these same salt forms.

When used within the recommended doses, side-effects like loss of appetite tend to decrease over time. However, amphetamines last longer in the body than [[methylphenidate]] ([[Ritalin]] [[Concerta]]), and tend to have stronger side-effects on appetite and sleep. 

Amphetamines are also a standard treatment for [[narcolepsy]] as well as other sleeping disorders. They are generally effective over long periods of time without producing addiction or physical dependence.

Amphetamines are sometimes used to augment anti-depressant therapy in treatment-resistant depression.

Medical use for weight loss is still approved in some countries, but is regarded as obsolete and dangerous in, for example, the United States.

== Performance-enhancing use ==
Amphetamines are usually not used by athletes in sports involving extreme cardiovascular efforts, as methamphetamine and amphetamine put a great deal of additional stress on the heart.

The [[United States Air Force]] uses amphetamines ([[Dexedrine]]) as stimulants for pilots, calling them &quot;go-pills.&quot; After a mission, the Air Force issues a &quot;no-go pill&quot; ([[Zolpidem|Ambien]]) to help the pilot sleep.

Amphetamines have been popular among some truck drivers, construction workers, and factory workers whose jobs require long or irregular [[shift work]] or automatic, repetitive tasks. It is for this reason that they are sometimes labeled a &quot;redneck drug.&quot; They are also used by [[white-collar]] workers trying to stay alert during long hours of multitasking, and by students hoping to improve their academic performance. There has also been at least one report of the coercive administration of amphetamines to cannery workers in Thailand, in order to enhance productivity (Seabrook, 1996). 

== Effects of use==
Amphetamines release stores of [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] from nerve endings by converting the respective molecular transporters into open channels. Amphetamine also releases stores of [[serotonin]] from [[synaptic vesicle]]s. Like [[methylphenidate]] ([[Ritalin]]), amphetamines also prevent the [[monoamine transporter]]s for [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] from recycling them (called [[reuptake]] inhibition), which leads to increased amounts of dopamine and norepinephrine in [[synaptic cleft]]s.

These combined effects rapidly increases the concentrations of the respective [[neurotransmitter]]s in the [[synaptic cleft]], which promotes nerve impulse transmission in neurons that have those receptors.  

==='''Physiological effects'''===
Short-term [[physiology|physiological]] effects include [[decreased appetite]], [[increased stamina]] and physical energy, increased [[sexual drive]]/response, involuntary bodily movements, [[increased perspiration]], [[hyperactivity]], [[jitteriness]], [[nausea]], itchy, blotchy or [[greasy skin]], [[increased heart rate]], [[irregular heart rate]], and [[headaches]]. [[Fatigue]] can often follow the dose's period of effectiveness. Overdose can be treated with [[chlorpromazine]]. [http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/amphsulf_od.htm]

Long-term abuse or overdose effects can include [[tremor]], restlessness, changed sleep patterns, poor skin condition, [[hyperreflexia]], [[tachypnea]], gastrointestinal narrowing, and weakened [[immune system]].  [[Fatigue]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] can follow the excitement stage.  [[Erectile dysfunction]], heart problems, stroke, and liver, kidney and lung damage can result from prolonged use. When snorted, amphetamine can lead to a deterioration of the lining of the nostrils.
Short-term psychological effects can include alertness, euphoria, increased concentration, rapid talking, increased confidence, increased social responsiveness, [[nystagmus]] (eye wiggles), hallucinations, and loss of [[Rapid eye movement|REM]] sleep the night after use. 

Long-term psychological effects can include insomnia, mental states resembling [[schizophrenia]], aggressiveness (not associated with schizophrenia), addiction or dependence with accompanying withdrawal symptoms, irritability, confusion, and panic. Chronic and/or extensively-continuous use can lead to [[amphetamine psychosis]], which causes delusions and paranoia, but this is uncommon when taken as prescribed. Amphetamine is highly-psychologically addictive, and, with chronic use, tolerance develops very quickly. Withdrawal is, although not physiologically threatening, an unpleasant experience (including [[paranoia]], depression, difficult breathing, [[dysphoria]], gastric fluctuations and/or pain, and [[lethargia]]). This commonly leads chronic users to re-dose amphetamine frequently, explaining tolerance and increasing the possibility of addiction.

==Addiction==
Because of the widespread ability in prescription amphetamine today, mainly in the ADD/ADHD medicines [[Adderall]] and [[Dexedrine]], there is an increased risk of abuse and addiction among persons of all ages. [[Tolerance]] is developed rapidly in amphetamine use, therefore increasing amount of the drug that is needed to satisfy the adiction. Many abusers will repeat the amphetamine cycle by taking more of the drug during the [[withdrawal]]. This leads to a very dangerous cycle and may involve the use of other drugs to get over the withdrawal process.

Anyone is able to develope tolerance to amphetamines. Children and other [[ADD]] and [[ADHD]] sufferers have been known to feel different when not taking the medication, a feeling significantly different enough from being medicated that drives the users to keep taking the drug when it is not needed, however, addiction to ADD/ADHD medication is rare if it is not abused or wrongly prescribed.

==Legal issues==
* In the United Kingdom, amphetamines are regarded as [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|Class B]] drugs. The maximum penalty for unauthorised possession is three months' imprisonment and a £2,500 fine.

* In the United States, amphetamine and [[methamphetamine]] are [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule II drugs|Schedule II]] controlled drugs, classified as a CNS (Central Nervous System) Stimulant.  A Schedule II drug is classified as one that: has a high potential for abuse, has a currently-accepted medical use and is used under severe restrictions, and has a high possibility of severe psychological and physiological dependence. 

On the international scene, amphetamine is a Schedule II drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]{{ref|www.incb.org.684}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Asynchronous communication''' is sending data without [[synchronization]] to an external clock.
The asynchronous communication technique is a physical layer transmission technique which is most widely used for personal computers providing connectivity to printers, modems, fax machines, etc. The most significant aspect of asynchronous communications is that the transmitter and receiver clock are independent and are not synchronised..

{{history of war}}
Historically, '''''artillery''''' refers to any engine used for the discharge of [[projectile]]s  during [[war]]. The term also describes ground-based [[soldier|troop]]s with the primary function of manning such [[weapon]]s. Sometimes known as &quot;The King of Battle&quot;. The word is derived from the [[Old French]] [[verb]] ''attilier'', meaning ''&quot;to equip&quot;''.

== History ==
The first documented record of artillery used on the battle field is on [[January 28]], [[1132]]. General [[Han Shizhong]] of the [[Song Dynasty]] used [[Escalade]] and Artillery to capture a city in [[Fujian]].   

The word as used in the current context originated in the [[Middle Ages]]. It comes from the [[Old French]] ''atellier'' meaning &quot;to arrange&quot;, and ''attillement'' meaning &quot;equipment&quot;. From the [[13th century]] an ''artillier'' referred to a builder of any war equipment, and for the next 250 years the sense of the word &quot;artillery&quot; covered all forms of military weapons.

Older engines like the [[catapult]], [[onager (siege weapon)|onager]], [[trebuchet]] and [[ballista]] are artillery, but the modern term really dates from the mid [[15th century]] with [[bombard]]s and then [[cannon]].

Bombards are the earliest of gunpowder artillery, distinguished by their lack of a field carriage, immobility once emplaced, highly individual design, and noted unreliability. The use of the word cannon marks the introduction of a dedicated field carriage with axle, trail and horse-drawn limber - this produced mobile field pieces that could move and support an army in action rather than being found only in siege and static defences. Cannon were always muzzle-loaders, casting technology having standardized and removed the often dangerous breech-loading design.

[[Image:Artillery gun crew-illustration.jpeg|thumb|Continental Artillery crew from the American Revolution]]
[[Image:93RAM 155 TR F1 16082231456651583.jpg|thumb|155&amp;nbsp;mm [[howitzer]], [[Troupes de Marine|French marine artillery]].]]
[[Image:Tir.jpg|thumb|Firing of a 18-pound gun, [[Louis-Philippe Crepin]], (1772 &amp;ndash; 1851)]]
[[Image:MuseeMarine-canonBronze-p1000434.jpg|thumb|Naval piece of artillery, early 19th century]]
[[Image:MuseeMarine-canon-1880-p1000439.jpg|thumb|French naval piece of the late 19th Century]]

Cannon operation was still a complex technical task, often undertaken at high-speed and in stressful conditions, where a mistake could easily be lethal. The field carriage eased movement in general, but traverse and elevation were still very limited and slow - the crew ramming levers, handspikes, to force a movement of a few degrees. Larger movements were by brute force shoves of the entire unit, as was repositioning after recoil, an extremely enervating task.

The combining of shot and powder into a single unit, a cartridge, occurred in the 1620s with a simple fabric bag, and was quickly adopted by all nations. It speeded loading and made it safer, but unexpelled bag fragments were an additional fouling in the gun barrel and a new tool - a worm - was introduced to remove them. Shells, explosive-filled fused projectiles, were also developed - problems with the fuses were extremely common. 
The development of specialised pieces - shipboard artillery, [[howitzers]] and [[mortars]] - was also begun in this period. More esoteric designs, like the multi-barrel [[ribaudequin]], were also built.

The [[17th century]] book by [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] inventor [[Kazimierz Siemienowicz]] &quot;''Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima''&quot; (&quot;Great Art of Artillery, the First Part&quot;. also known as &quot;The Complete Art of Artillery&quot;) was one of the most important contemporary publications on the subject of artillery. For over two centuries this work was used in [[Europe]] as a basic artillery manual.

Oddly the development of cannon almost halted until the 19th-century, improvements in metallurgy, chemistry, manufacturing, and so on, did not alter the basic design and operation of a cannon. From the 1860s artillery was forced into a series of rapid technological and operational changes, accelerating through the 1870s and on. The main impetus was the improvements in small arms, which certainly had not spent 200 years in the doldrums. Artillery could no longer be deployed in the battle line, the large crews and stocks of ammunition were vulnerable to rifle fire, but had to either become smaller, lighter, more mobile and stay with the troops or get much further away. The second type, using indirect fire, forced the development of the technologies and doctrines that produced modern artillery.

== Modern artillery ==
[[modern era|Modern]] artillery is distinguished by its large caliber, firing an [[explosive]] [[shell (projectile)|shell]] or [[rocket]], and being of such a size and weight as to require a specialized mount for firing and transport. Weapons covered by this term include &quot;[[cannon]]&quot; artillery such as the [[howitzer]], [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], and [[field gun]] and &quot;[[rocket]]&quot; artillery.  Certain smaller caliber mortars are more properly designated small arms rather than artillery, albeit indirect-fire small arms.

The term &quot;artillery&quot; has traditionally not been used for projectiles with internal [[guidance systems]], even though some artillery units employ surface-to-surface [[missile|missiles]].  Advances in terminal guidance systems for small munitions has allowed large caliber projectiles to be developed, blurring this distinction.

== Types ==
The types of cannon artillery are generally distinguished by the velocity at which they fire projectiles. Naval guns or [[infantry support gun]]s are typically longer-barreled, low-trajectory, high-velocity weapons designed primarily for a direct-fire role. Typically the length of a cannon barrel is greater than 25 times its caliber (inner diameter).

[[Howitzer]]s are relatively shorter. Capable of both high- and low-angle fire, they are most often employed in an [[indirect-fire]] role, capable of operating in [[defilade]]. Typically, the length of a howitzer cannon is between 15 and 25 times its caliber.

[[mortar (weapon)|Mortar]]s are smaller, low-velocity, high-angle weapons capable of only high-trajectory fire at a relatively short range. Typically the length of a mortar barrel is less than 15 times its caliber.

Modern field artillery can also be split into two other categories: towed and self-propelled. As the name implies, towed artillery has a prime mover, usually a [[jeep]] or [[truck]], to move the piece, crew, and ammunition around. Self-propelled howitzers are permanently mounted on a carriage or vehicle with room for the crew and ammunition and capable of moving independently in order to move quickly from one firing position to another - to both support the fluid nature of modern combat and to avoid [[counter-battery fire]]. There are also mortar carrier vehicles, many of which allow the mortar to be removed from the vehicle and be used dismounted, potentially in terrain in whichthe vehicle cannot navigate or in order to avoid detection.

=== Sub-types ===
[[Image:60 pounder Cape Helles June 1915.jpg|thumb|A British 60-pounder (5 inch) gun at full recoil, in action during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], 1915.]]

Types of artillery:
* [[Field artillery]] - mobile weapons used to support armies in the field.  Subcategories include:
** [[infantry support gun]]s - directly support infantry units (mostly obsolete).
** [[mountain gun]]s - lightweight weapons that can be moved through difficult terrain.
** [[howitzer]]s - capable of high angle fire.
** [[gun howitzer]]s - capable of high or low angle fire with a long barrel.
** [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s - lightweight weapons that fire projectiles at an angle of over 45 degrees to the horizontal.
* [[Self-propelled artillery]] - typically guns, mortars or gun howitzers mounted on a vehicle.
* [[Naval artillery]] - cannons mounted on warships and used either against other ships or in support of ground forces. The crowning achievement of naval artillery was the [[battleship]], but the advent of air-power and missiles have rendered this type of artillery largely obsolete.
* [[Coastal artillery]] - Fixed-position weapons dedicated to defense of a particular location, usually a coast (e.g. the [[Atlantic Wall]] in [[World War II|WW II]]) or harbor.  Not needing to be mobile, coastal artillery can be much larger than equivalent field artillery pieces, giving them longer range and more destructive power. Since World War II, however, modern weapons and tactics have made them largely obsolete.
* [[Anti-aircraft artillery]] - weapons, usually mobile, dedicated to attacking aircraft from the ground.

=== Projectiles ===
[[Image:16-in Battleship Ammunition.JPG|thumb|Battleship Ammunition: 16&quot; artillery shells aboard one of [[United States|America's]] [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class battleships]].]]
All forms of artillery require a [[propellant]] to fire the projectile at the target. A number of different configurations have been developed, each with varying characteristics. They include:
* Tube fired - utilise the pressure of burnt propellant inside a barrel to force a projectile out of the mouth of the barrel.
** Spin stabilised - Use helical grooves or ridges on the inside of the barrel to impart a rotation to the projectile as it is travelling in the barrel.  (See also [[rifling]])
** Fin stabilised - Use fins at the rear of the projectile in the airflow to maintain correct orientation.
** Inverted tube - Some weapons have been built with the tube built into the projectile and fitted onto a rod fitted to the carriage.
* Recoilless - A tube fired weapon with a breech designed to perforate a bursting disk at firing, and permit a mass of burnt propellant gases with [[momentum]] equal to the projectile to exit from the rear of the barrel, to prevent recoil from affecting the weapon.
* [[Rocket]] propelled - Tube or rail launched - A reaction propulsion system mounted to the projectile provides continuous thrust for an initial period of the flight.
* Rocket assist - A combination of tube fired and rocket propelled - uses a rocket motor in the base of the projectile to extend the range by about 30%.
* [[Base bleed]] - Similar to a rocket assist projectile, uses a small pyrotechnic charge at the base of the projectile. The charge introduces sufficient combustion products into the low-pressure region behind the base of the projectile responsible for a large proportion of the [[Form drag|drag]] to substantially (&gt; 30%) increase range. Like a rocket assist projectile, trajectory is changed to non-ballistic, which may complicate counter-battery location.

=== Ammunition ===
High-explosive; shrapnel, dual purpose improved conventional munitions (DPICM)- bomblet; canister or anti-personnel; illuminating or star-shell; armour-piercing; incendiary (white phosphorus, &quot;Willie Pete&quot;); gas or aerosol, chemical or biological; smoke; nuclear and non-lethal (developing area - includes High Power Microwave HPM, and NL payload carrier shells).

=== [[Fuse (explosives)|Fuzes]] ===
Quick or super-quick; delay; hardened-delay or concrete-piercing; timer; proximity.  [[Proximity fuze]]s can be set to detonate at various heights for above ground detonation providing for air-bursts which multiply the round's killing effectiveness.  In anti-aircraft fire the proximity fuze can be made to have a premature detonation because of the moisture in heavy rain clouds.  The proximity fuze emerged on the battlefields of Europe in 1944, and was signicant in providing a counter to German personnel in open.  Proximity fuzes were a big improvement over the mechanical fuze which it replaced.

Depending on the calibre of the weapons, artillery is used in a variety of roles. Mortars fire relatively short range and small- to medium-calibre (up to about 120 mm) projectiles. Modern mortars, because of their lighter weight and simpler, more transportable design, are usually organic to [[infantry]] and [[armor]] units, allowing greater responsiveness and negating their shorter range.

Howitzers are generally used in direct support of infantry and armor, where the guns of a [[Artillery battery|battery]] or even a [[battalion]] will be massed to fire simultaneously onto a single point or area target. Howitzers are usually between about 105 mm and 155 mm in calibre.

=== Counter-battery fire ===
Attacks aimed at enemy artillery rather than infantry or fortifications are known as [[counter-battery fire|counter battery fire]].

[[Radar]] coupled to [[computer|computers]] can accurately track a projectile in flight back to its firing point. This can be used as targeting information for an enemy artillery site.

When artillery fire is directed via radio by a forward observer (FO), the location of FO's transmitter can be calculated and attacked with artillery as well. If successful, this counter-attack will limit the effectiveness of the FO's artillery fire. Radar also improves the all-weather flexibility of modern artillery.

The rise in counter-battery abilities has driven field artillery to adopt &quot;[[shoot-and-scoot]]&quot; tactics emphasizing constant maneuver within a designated position area, usually from hide point to firing point and back again. This has required reliance on sometimes temperamental technology and increased the cost of modern field artillery systems.

=== Field artillery team ===
{{main|field artillery}}
Modern field artillery (Post-[[World War I]]) has three distinct parts: the forward observer (or FO), the fire direction center (FDC) and the actual guns themselves.  The forward observer observes the target using tools such as [[binocular]]s, [[laser range-finder]]s, designators and call back fire missions on his radio.  The FO deals solely with the FDC, of which there is usually one per each [[Artillery battery|battery]] of six guns. The FDC computes firing data, ''fire direction'', for the guns. The FDC will transmit the fire order to the guns, specifying the number of volleys, shell and fuze combination, charge, deflection and quadrant elevation, and any special instructions.

=== MRSI ===
It is possible for modern computer-controlled artillery to fire more than one volley at a target and have all the shells arrive simultaneously, which is called MRSI (Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact). This is because there is more than one trajectory for the rounds to fly to any given target - typically one is below 45 degrees from horizontal and the other is above it, and if you can vary the amount of propellant with each shell, you can create more trajectories. Because the higher trajectories cause the shells to arc higher into the air, they take longer to reach the target and so if the shells are fired on these trajectories for the first volleys (starting with the shell with the most propellant and working down) and then after the correct pause more volleys are fired on the lower trajectories, the shells will all arrive at the same time. This is useful because many more shells can land on the target with no warning. With traditional volleys along the same trajectory, anybody at the target point will have a certain amount of time (however long it takes to reload and re-fire the guns) to run away or take cover between volleys. In addition, if guns in more than one location are firing on one target, with careful timing it can be arranged for all their shells to land at the same time for the same reason.

Examples of MRSI guns are [[South Africa]]'s [[Denel G6]]-52 (which can land six rounds simultaneously at targets at least 25 km away) and [[Germany]]'s [[PzH 2000 howitzer|Panzer Haubitze 2000]] (which can land five rounds simultaneously at targets at least 17 km away). The [[United States]] [[XM2001 Crusader|Crusader]] programme (now cancelled) was slated to have MRSI capability.

When an effect similar to that of MRSI is achieved using separate batteries of traditional artillery, using varying fuzes to account for the variant distances or trajectories to cause all shells to detonate on the target at the same time, it is called TOT (Time On Target).  The logic behind this practice is the same as that for MRSI: to surprise the enemy and to sow confusion when guns heard to be firing at different times nonetheless result in deadly explosions in the same instant.  

An additional wrinkle can be added when some or all of the shells are set for airburst, meaning they explode in the air above the target instead of upon impact.  This is a very effective tactic against infantry and light vehicles because it scatters the [[shrapnel]] over a larger area and prevents the blast [[shockwave]] from being blocked by terrain, but usually proves ineffective against troops or equipment protected by even rudimentary [[fortification|fortifications]]. However, airbursts are probably more likely to impact units protected by [[trench]]es and [[revetment]]s, since the shrapnel can enter them from above, while a ground-burst nearby would simply cause the shrapnel to impact the walls or fly overhead.

== Quotations ==
*&quot;God fights on the side with the best artillery.&quot; - [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Another version of this quotation is: &quot;God is on the side of the stronger [[battalion]].&quot;

*&quot;I do not have to tell you who won the war. You know, the artillery did.&quot; - Gen [[George S. Patton]]

*&quot;Our artillery... The Germans feared it almost more than anything we had.&quot; - [[Ernie Pyle]] &quot;Brave Men&quot;, 1944 A.D.

*&quot;Artillery is the god of war.&quot; - [[Stalin]]

*&quot;Contrary to popular belief, we at artillery command do not believe we're God.  We merely borrowed His &quot;Smite&quot; button.&quot; - Anonymous

*&quot;The Mission of the Artillery is to give some class to what would otherwise be merely a vulgar brawl.&quot; - Some Redleg (American Artilleryman, since their dress blue uniforms have red stripes). This quotation has also been attributed to [[Frederick the Great]].

*&quot;Without support the infantry won't move.&quot; (In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] it rhymes) - The [[motto]] of the [[Israeli Artillery Corps]].

*&quot;Infantry err, infantry die. Artillery err, infantry die.&quot; -[[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] black humor slogan

*&quot;The bombs land with awesome explosions, the earth trembles, the upcast of craters jets in the air, the troops are shocked by the blast waves, many bleed from noses or perforated ear drums, they are terrorized into apathy or outright panic.  But unless the enemy is nearby and ready to advance immediately, the moment passes.&quot; - [[Edward Luttwak]]

*&quot;Since infantry is considered the 'Queen of Battle', and artillery the king, I had inscribed my personal banner &quot;Balls for the Queen&quot;. Granted, high explosive 150 millimeter shells aren't exactly cannonballs, but hey, why spoil a perfectly good motto?&quot; - [[Tommy Franks]], while an artillery lieutenant in Vietnam.

*&quot;An artillery barrage is a terrifying thing.&quot; - [[Erich Maria Remarque]]

*&quot;If two sides start out at equal strength, and are relatively equally damaged, but one side can replenish his artillery, and the other side cannot, then that one side that gets his artillery back has all but won.&quot; - Anonymous

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arnulf of Carinthia''' ([[German language|German]] ''Arnulf von Kärnten'',  [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] ''Arnulf Koroški'') ([[850]] &amp;ndash; [[December 8]] [[899]]) was one of the last ruling members of the [[Carolingians|Carolingian Dynasty]] in [[East Francia]], which had been split from the rest of [[Frankish]] territory by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in [[843]].  He was the illegitimate son of the [[duke of Bavaria|Bavarian king]] [[Carloman, King of Bavaria|Carloman]] and his [[concubine]], Liutswind (also ''Litwinde'' or ''Litwindie''), of [[Carinthia]]n origin, daughter of one Count Ernst.  He was given the [[duchy of Carinthia]] (a Frankish [[vassal]] state and successor of the ancient [[Principality of Karantania]]) by his father when he divided his realm, giving Bavaria to [[Louis the Younger]] and [[Italy]] to [[Charles the Fat]], in [[880]] on his death.  

He spent his childhood in Karantania, homeland of his mother.  Carloman had a court there, in [[Moosburg]] (then ''Blatograd''), where the young Arnulf grew up.  From later events it is evident that the Karantanians, from an early time, treated him as their own duke. 

He took the leading role in the deposition of his uncle, the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles the Fat]].  With the support of the nobles, Arnulf assumed his title of [[King of Germany|King of East Francia]] (later [[Germany]]) in [[887]].  Charles asked only for a few royal villas in [[Swabia]], which Arnulf granted him.  

Arnulf was not a negotiator, but a fighter. At the decisive [[Battle of Leuven]] on [[September]] [[891]], he defeated an invading force of the Northmen, or [[Vikings]], essentially ending invasion attempts on that front. The ''Annales Fuldensis'' (Annals of [[Fulda]]) report that the bodies of dead Northmen blocked the run of the river.  After his victory, Arnulf had built a new [[castle]] on an island in the [[Dijle]] river ([[Latin]] ''Luvanium'', local ''Lovon''). 

In [[894]] or [[895]], [[Great Moravia]] probably lost a part of its territory &amp;mdash; present-day Western [[Hungary]] &amp;mdash; to him.  Arnulf, however, failed to conquer Great Moravia in [[892]], [[893]], and [[899]].  In 895, [[Bohemia]] broke away from Great Moravia and became his vassal.  An accord was made between him and the [[duke of Bohemia|Bohemian Duke]] [[Borivoj]] (reigned [[870]]-[[895]]); Bohemia was freed from the danger of invasion. 

Arnulf invaded [[Italy]] in [[896]] and was crowned [[Emperor]] and [[King of Italy]] by [[Pope Formosus]] ([[pope]] [[891]]-[[896]]) in opposition to [[Lambert of Spoleto]]. He only retained power in Italy as long as he was personally there, he was vigourously opposed by Lambert's mother, [[Agiltrude]], and when he left, having taken ill, most of Italy was in Lambert's supporters' hands.  On his death in [[899]], he was succeeded as a king of the [[East Franks]] by his son by his wife Ota, [[Louis the Child]] ([[900]]-[[911]]).

Arnulf's illegitimate son [[Zwentibold]] reigned as [[king of Lotharingia]] from [[895]] to [[900]].

'''Alexanderplatz''' is a large open square and public transport hub in central [[Berlin]], near the [[Spree]] river and the [[Berliner Dom]]. Berliners often call it simply ''Alex''. 

Originally a cattle market, it was named in honour of a visit of the [[Russia]]n Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to Berlin on [[25 October]] [[1805]]. It gained a prominent role in the late 19th century with the construction of the station of the same name and a nearby public market, becoming a major commercial centre. Its heyday was in the [[1920s]], when together with [[Potsdamer Platz]] it was at the heart of Berlin's [[nightlife]], inspiring the [[1929]] [[novel]] ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]''. (see [[1920s Berlin]])

The Alexanderplatz has been subject to redevelopment several times in its history, most recently during the [[1960s]], when it was enlarged as part of the [[German Democratic Republic]]'s redevelopment of the city centre. It is surrounded by several notable structures including the [[Fernsehturm]] (TV Tower), the second tallest structure in [[Europe]]. Because of its high profile, many newcomers to Berlin mistake the [[nickname]] ''Alex'' and apply it to the Fernsehturm instead. The ''Alex'' also accommodates the [[Forum Hotel Berlin]] and the World Time Clock, a continually rotating installation that shows the time throughout the globe.

[[Image:Berlin - Weltzeituhr.jpg|thumb|The World time clock]]
Following [[German reunification]] the Alexanderplatz has undergone a gradual process of change with many of the surrounding buildings being renovated. Despite the construction of a [[tram]] line and the addition of some greenery it has retained its socialist character, including the much-[[graffiti]]ed ''Fountain of Friendship between Peoples'' (''Brunnen der Völkerfreundschaft''). In [[1993]] plans for a major redevelopment including the construction of several skyscrapers were published, but due to a lack of demand it is unlikely these will be constructed. However, beginning with the reconstruction of the department store [[Kaufhof]] in 2004, some buildings will be redesigned and new structures built on the square's south-eastern side.

Many historic buildings are located in the area around Alexanderplatz. The traditional seat of city government, the [[Rotes Rathaus]], or ''Red City Hall'',  is located nearby, as is the East German parliament building, the [[Palast der Republik]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Asian Development Bank (ADB)'''  is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific. It was founded in 1966 with 31 members states and has now grown to include 64.

==Organization==

The highest policy-making body of the bank is the ''Board of Governors'' composed of one representative from each member state. The Board of Governors, in turn, elect among themselves the 12 members of the ''Board of Directors'' and their deputy. Eight of the 12 members come from regional (Asia-Pacific) members while the rest come from non-regional members.

The Board of Governors also elect the bank's ''President'' who is the legal representative of the bank and manages the Board of Directors. The president has a term of office lasting five years, and may be reelected. Traditionally, and because [[Japan]] is one of the largest shareholders of the bank, the President has always been Japanese. The current President is [[Haruhiko Kuroda]].

The headquarters of the bank is at 6 ADB Avenue, [[Mandaluyong City]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]], and it has representative offices around the world. The bank employs approximately 2,000 people, more than half of which are [[Filipino people|Filipino]].

The bank has been under corruption investigation by the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs.

*[[Gujarat(INDIA) Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project]] (US$500M)
*[[Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program]]

'''Aswan''' 
([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''محافظة أسوان  '''''Asw&amp;#257;n'')
({{coor dm|24|05|N|32|56|E|}}, population 200,000) is a city in the south of [[Egypt]], the capital of the [[Aswan Governorate]]. It stands on the east bank of the [[Nile]] at the [[first cataract]] and is a busy market and tourist center.

Aswan is one of the driest inhabited places in the world; as of early 2001, the last rain here was 6 years ago. In [[Nubia]]n settlements they generally do not bother to roof all of the rooms in their houses.

This is identified with the ancient city of '''Syene''', which is famous for providing a basis on which [[Eratosthenes]] disputed the [[Flat Earth]] theory and attempted to determine the circumference of the Earth, using Syene as the originating point and [[Alexandria]] as the terminal point of a measured arc to make an accurate estimate of the circumference of the Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''Another Saint Adelaide is [[Adelaide, Abbess of Vilich]]''.
Saint '''Adelaide of Italy''' ([[931]]-[[December 16]], [[999]]) was the daughter of [[Rudolf II of Burgundy]], King of [[Italy]]. Her first [[marriage]] was to [[Lothar of Italy|Lothar]], King of Italy, and was part of a political settlement designed to conclude a peace between her father, Rudolf II, and [[Hugh of Provence]], the father of Lothar.

The Calendar of Saints states that her first husband was poisoned by his successor, [[Berengar of Ivrea]], who attempted to cement his political power by forcing her to marry his son; when she refused, she was imprisoned for four months, and escaped to [[Canossa]], where she threw herself on the mercy of [[Monarch|King]] [[Otto I the Great]]; they subsequently married in [[951]] . They had four [[child]]ren: Henry, born in [[952]]; Bruno, born [[953]]; [[Matilda, Abbess of Quedlinburg]], born about [[954]]; and [[Otto II]], later [[Holy Roman Emperor]], born [[955]]. 

When her husband Otto I died in [[973]] he was succeeded by their son Otto II, and Adelaide for some years exercised a powerful influence at court. Later, however, her daughter-in-law, the Byzantine princess [[Theophanu|Theophano]], turned her husband against his mother, and she was driven from court. Finally a reconciliation was effected, and in 983 Otto appointed her his viceroy in Italy. However, Otto died the same year, and although both mother and grandmother were appointed as co-regents for the child-king, Otto III, Theophano forced Adelaide to [[abdicate]] and exiled her. When Theophano died in 991, Adelaide was restored the regency of her grandson. She was assisted by [[Willigis]], bishop of [[Mainz]]. In 995 Otto III came of age, and Adelaide was free to devote herself exclusively to works of charity, notably the foundation or restoration of religious houses. 

Adelaide had long entertained close relations with [[Cluny]], then the center of the movement for ecclesiastical reform and in particular with its abbots Majolus and Odilo. She retired to the convent of Seltz near [[Cologne]]. Though she never became a nun, she spent the rest of her days there in prayer. On her way to [[Burgundy]] to support her nephew Rudolf III against a rebellion, she died at a monastery she had founded [[Seltz]] in the [[Alsace]] on [[December 16]], [[999]]. She had constantly devoted herself to the service of the church and peace, and to the empire as guardian of both; she also interested herself in the conversion of the Slavs. She was thus a principal agent—almost an embodiment—of the work of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] during the [[Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] in the construction of the religion-culture of western Europe. Her feast day is still kept in many [[Germany|German]] dioceses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Addition of natural numbers''' is the most basic arithmetic operation. In its simplest form, addition combines two numbers (terms, summands), the augend and addend, into a single number, the sum.

== Notation and terms ==

The operation of '''addition''', commonly written as the [[infix]] [[operator]] &quot;+&quot;, is a [[function_(mathematics)|function]] + : '''N''' &amp;times; '''N''' &amp;rarr; '''N'''. For natural numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', we write

:&lt;math&gt;a + b = c.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''a'' is the ''augend'', ''b'' is the ''addend'', and ''c'' is the ''sum''.

== Definition ==

We let ''S''(''a'') denote the ''successor of a'' as defined in the [[Peano postulates]]. 

Addition is defined inductively by fixing the augend. In other words, we let ''a'' be any arbitrary, but fixed natural number, and we then make the following definitions:

* ''a'' + 0 = ''a'' [A1]
* ''a'' + ''S''(''b'') = ''S''(''a'' + ''b'') [A2]

By the recursion theorem, this defines a unique function &quot;''a'' +&quot; : '''N''' &amp;rarr; '''N'''. In words, it says that adding zero to ''a'' gives back ''a'', and that applying the successor function to the addend has the effect of applying the successor function to the sum.

Since ''a'' was an arbitrary natural number, we can &quot;put together&quot; all these functions into a single binary operation '''N''' &amp;times; '''N''' &amp;rarr; '''N'''.

== Properties ==

The following are three immediate and important properties of addition which can be deduced from the definition.

* [[associative|Associativity]]: for all natural numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', we have
:&lt;math&gt;(a + b) + c = a + (b + c);\,&lt;/math&gt; ([[Addition of natural numbers/proofs#Proof of associativity|proof]])
* [[commutative|Commutativity]]: for all natural numbers ''a'' and ''b'', we have
:&lt;math&gt;a + b = b + a;\,&lt;/math&gt; ([[Addition of natural numbers/proofs#Proof of commutativity|proof]])
* [[Identity element]]: for all natural numbers ''a'', we have
:&lt;math&gt;a + 0 = 0 + a = a.\,&lt;/math&gt; ([[Addition of natural numbers/proofs#Proof of identity element|proof]])

Together, these three properties show that the set of natural numbers '''N''' under addition is a commutative [[monoid]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:luft.a300b4.d-aias.750pix..jpg|thumb|250px|Lufthansa Airbus A300]]
The '''Airbus A300''' is a short to medium range [[Wide-body aircraft|widebody]] aircraft. Launched in 1972, it was the first twin-engined widebody in the world, and the first aircraft created by the [[Airbus]] consortium of European aerospace companies.

==Development history==
The basic mission requirements were given by Frank Kolk, an [[American Airlines]] executive, in 1966, for a [[Boeing 727]] replacement on busy short to medium range routes such as US transcontinental flights. His brief included a passenger capacity of 250 to 300 seated in a twin-aisle configuration and fitted with two engines, with the capability of carrying full passengers without penalty from high altitude airports like [[Denver]]. American manufacturers responded with widebody trijets, the Douglas [[DC-10]] and the [[Lockheed L-1011 Tristar]], as twinjets were banned from many routes by the FAA.

French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] resented the US domination of civil aviation and wanted a European airliner that could compete with American designs. [[Concorde]] was part of the answer, designed for intercontinental routes; the other was the A300, designed to meet Mr Kolk's US domestic requirements. 

[[image:IMG 1265r.jpg|thumb|250px|American Airlines A300]]

In September 1967 the British, French and German governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to start development of the 300 seat Airbus A300. An earlier announcement had been made in July 1967 but had been complicated by the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC). The British government refused to back BAC's proposed competitor, a development of the [[BAC 1-11]] and instead supported the Airbus aircraft.

In the months following this agreement both the French and British governments expressed doubts about the aircraft. Another problem was the requirement for a new engine (to be developed by Rolls-Royce, the RB207). In December 1968 the French and British partner companies, Sud Aviation and Hawker Siddeley proposed a revised configuration, the 250 seat Airbus A250. Renamed the A300B the aircraft would not require new engines, reducing development costs. To attract potential US customers, American [[General Electric CF6-50]] engines powered the A300, instead of the British RB207. The British government was upset and withdrew from the venture: however, the British firm Hawker Siddeley stayed on as a contractor, developing the wings for the A300, which were pivotal in later versions' impressive performance from short domestic to long intercontinental flights. (Years later, through [[British Aerospace]], the UK reentered the consortium.)

Airbus Industrie was formally set up in 1970 following an agreement between Aerospatiale (France) and Deutsche Aerospace (Germany) (joined by CASA of Spain in 1971). Each company would deliver its sections as fully equipped, ready to fly items. 

In 1972 the A300 made its maiden flight and the first production model, the A300B2 entered service in 1974. Initially the success of the consortium was poor but by 1979 there were 81 aircraft in service. It was the launch of the A320 in 1981 that guaranteed Airbus as a major player in the aircraft market - the aircraft had over 400 orders before it first flew, compared to 15 for the A300 in 1972.

The A300 is the first airliner to use just-in-time manufacturing techniques. Whole complete sections were manufactured by consortium partners all over Europe. These were airlifted to the final assembly line in [[Toulouse]] by a fleet of [[Boeing 377]]-derived [[Aero Spacelines Super Guppy]] aircraft. Originally devised as a way to share the work among Airbus's partners without the expense of two assembly lines, it turned out to be a more efficient way of building airplanes (more flexible and reduced costs) as opposed to building the whole airplane at one site. This fact was not lost on Boeing, which decided to manufacture the [[Boeing 787]] in this manner, using outsized 747s to ferry wings and other parts from [[Japan]].

The A300 cemented European cooperation in aviation. Its first flight was commemorated on a [[France|French]] three-[[franc]] stamp.

==Technology==
[[Image:Airbus A300-600R Egyptair SU-GAR.jpg|thumb|250px|Egypt Air Airbus A300-600R]]
Airbus partners employed the latest technology, some derived from the [[Concorde]]. On entry into service, in 1974, the A300, was very advanced and  influenced later subsonic airliner designs. The technological highlights include:

*Advanced wings by De Havilland (later [[BAE Systems]]) with:
**[[Supercritical wing|supercritical airfoil section ]]for excellent economical performance
**advanced aerodynamically efficient flight controls
*advanced 222-inch diameter circular fuselage section for 8-abreast passenger seating and wide enough for 2 [[Unit Load Device|LD3]] cargo containers side-by-side giving it bigger belly cargo cross-section than a [[Boeing 747]]. The circular fuselage crossection was later used in the larger [[Boeing 777]]. 
*Structures made from metal [[billet (manufacturing)|billet]]s, reducing weight
*the first airliner to be fitted with [[wind shear]] protection
*advanced autopilots capable of flying the aircraft from climb-out to landing
*Electrically controlled braking system

Later A300s incorporate other advanced features such as
*2-man crew by automating the flight engineer's functions, an industry first (a request made by [[Garuda Indonesia]], an idea proposed by [[Jusuf Habibie|B. J. Habibie]] , who at that time was [[Indonesia]]'s Minister of Research and Technology)
*[[glass cockpit]] flight instruments
*extensive use of composites
*centre-of-gravity control by shifting around fuel
*the first airliner to use wing fences for better aerodynamics

All these made the A300 a perfect substitute for the widebody trijets such as [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] and [[Lockheed L-1011]] for short to medium routes. On the early versions, Airbus even used the same engines and similar major systems as the DC-10. Asian airlines bought the concept and used the early A300s as a complement to the widebody trijets on such routes.

==In-service==
After the launch, sales of the A300 were weak for some years, with most orders going to airlines that had an obligation to order the locally-made product - notably [[Air France]] and [[Lufthansa]]. At one stage, Airbus had 16 &quot;whitetail&quot; A300s - completed but unsold aircraft - sitting on the tarmac.

In 1977 giant US carrier [[Eastern Airlines]] leased four A300s as an in-service trial. [[Frank Borman]], ex-astronaut and the then CEO, was impressed as the A300 consumed 30% less fuel than his fleet of Tristars and then ordered 23 of the type. This was followed by an order from [[Pan Am]]. From then on, the A300 family sold well, eventually reaching the current total of 858 on order or delivered. 

Also, [[Olympic Airlines]] operated A300-B4 and A300-605R jets for several years. Now it only operates a single A300-622R (SX-BEM 'Creta') (as of February 2005).

It found particular favour with Asian airlines. It was bought by [[Japan Air System]], [[Thai Airways International]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[Philippine Airlines]], [[Garuda Indonesia]], [[China Airlines]], [[PIA]], [[Indian Airlines]], [[Trans Australia Airlines]] and many others. As Asia was not restricted by the FAA [[ETOPS|60-minutes ruling]] for twin-engine airliners which existed at the time, Asian airlines used A300s for routes across [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[South China Sea]]. 

The Australians used them for domestic transcontinental routes. By 1981, Airbus was growing rapidly, with over 300 aircraft sold and options for 200 more planes for over forty airlines. This fact was not lost to Boeing which responded with the [[Boeing 767]].

The A300 provided Airbus the experience of manufacturing and selling airliners competitively. The basic fuselage of the A300 was later streched ([[A330]] and [[A340]]), shrunk ([[A310]]), or modified into many derivatives ([[Airbus Beluga]]). 
   
Currently, the A300 is reaching the end of its market life and is now mainly sold as a dedicated freighter. The largest freight operator of the A300 in the United States is Federal Express, which, as of January, 2006, has 95 A300/310 aircraft.  United Parcel Service (UPS) also has started using freighter versions of the A300.  The current version is the A300-600R and is rated for 180-minute ETOPS. The A300 has enjoyed renewed interest in the secondhand market for conversion to freighters. The freighter versions - either new-build A300-600's or converted ex-passenger A300-600's, A300B2's and B4's - account for most of the world freighter fleet after the [[Boeing 747]] freighter.

== Models==
* '''A300B1''' Only two were built: the first prototype and a second aircraft which was later sold for airline service. It has accommodation for 259 passengers with a maximum weight of 132,000 kg and two [[General Electric CF6-50|General Electric CF6-50A]] engines of 220 kN thrust.  
* '''A300B2''' The first production version. Powered by CF6 or [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D]] engines of between 227 and 236 kN thrust, it entered service with [[Air France]] in May 1974.
* '''A300B4''' The major production version. Features a center fuel tank for increased fuel capacity (47,500 kg). Produced in two versions. -100 with a Max Take Off weight of 157,500 kg and the -200  with a Max Take Off weight of 165,000 kg. Production of the B2 and B4 totaled 248.
* '''A300FFCC''' The first 2-man crew airliner. First saw service with [[Garuda]] and [[Varig]]
* '''A300B10 ''''''([[A310]])''' Introduced a shorter fuselage, a new, higher [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] wing, smaller tail and two crew operation. It is available in standard -200 and the extended range -300 with 9,600 km range in both passenger and full cargo versions. It is also available as a military tanker/transport serving the [[Luftwaffe]]. Sales to date total 260.
* '''A300C4''' Convertible freighter version, with a large cargo door on the port side.
* '''A300-600''' The current version is the same length as the B2 and B4 but has increased space because it uses the A310 rear fuselage and tail. It has higher power [[General Electric CF6-80|CF6-80]] or [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000]] engines and entered service in 1988. It is available in both passenger and freight versions, and forms the basis of the [[Airbus Beluga]]. A total of 330 A300-600s have been sold.
* '''A300-600R''' : The increased range -600, achieved by an additional trim fuel tank in the tail.
* '''A300-600 Convertible''' Passenger/cargo version.

==Incidents==
On [[July 3]], [[1988]], [[Iran Air]], [[Iran Air Flight 655 | Flight 655]] was shot down by the [[USS Vincennes (CG-49) | USS Vincennes]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] after being mistaken for an attacking [[Iran | Iranian]] [[F-14 Tomcat]], killing all 290 civilian passengers and crew.  [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/flight801/stories/july88crash.htm]

On [[September 26]], [[1997]], [[Garuda Indonesia]] [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 152 |Flight 152]] crashed while landing at [[Medan, Indonesia]] killing 234 aboard.

On [[November 12]], [[2001]], [[American Airlines]], [[American Airlines Flight 587 | Flight 587]] crashed into the [[Belle Harbor, Queens|Belle Harbor]] neighborhood of [[Queens, NY|Queens]], [[New York]] shortly  after takeoff from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]. All 260 people on board were killed. The official [[NTSB]] report of [[October 26]], [[2004]] stated the cause of the crash was the overuse of the [[rudder]] to counter [[Wingtip vortices | wake turbulence]] (causing the tail to eventually break off).

On [[November 22]], [[2003]], a [[European Air Transport]] A300B4-203F, operating on behalf of [[DHL]], was hit by an [[SA-7 Grail | SA-7 'Grail']] missile after take-off from [[Baghdad International Airport]]. The aeroplane rapidly lost all hydraulic pressure, and thus controls. The crew found that after extending the landing gear to create more drag, they could pilot the plane using differences in engine thrust and managed to land the plane with minimal further damage. The plane was later repaired and offered for sale ([http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20031122-0  incident summary and photos]).

'''Agostino Carracci''' (or '''Caracci''') ([[August 16]], [[1557]], in [[Bologna]] - [[March 22]], [[1602]], in [[Parma]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[painter]] and graphical artist. He posited the ideal in nature, and was the founder of the competing school to the more gritty (for lack of a better term) view of nature as expressed by [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]]. He was, along with his brothers, one of the founders of the [[Accademia degli Incamminati]], which helped propel painters of the [[Bolognese School (painting)|School of Bologna]] to prominence. 

''See also'' his brothers [[Annibale Carracci]] and [[Lodovico Carracci]].

==Gallery==
Despite working in a post-Tridentine ([[Council of Trent]]) environment restricting the use of public images, Agostino profited from the making of engravings of graphic and sensual images of mythologic or heroic love-making scenes. In Rome, his brother Anibale completed the elaborate fresco of [[The Loves of the Gods (Carracci)|Loves of the Gods]] for the [[Palazzo Farnese]], whose images from Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' intimate but do not depict the act of [[sexual intercourse|lovemaking]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Adenylate cyclase''' ({{EC number|4.6.1.1}}, also known as '''adenylyl cyclase''' or '''AC''') is a [[lyase]], an [[enzyme]] that [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the conversion of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[cyclic AMP|3',5'-cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) and [[pyrophosphate]].  cAMP is an important molecule in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[signal transduction]], a so-called [[second messenger]]. Adenylate cyclase can be activated or inhibited by [[G protein]]s, which are coupled to membrane receptors and thus can respond to hormonal or other stimuli.  There are nine known adenylate cyclases in [[mammal]]s.

==Structure==
Adenylate cyclase is a trans[[membrane]] protein. It passes through the [[plasma membrane]] twelve times. The important parts for its function are located in the [[cytoplasm]]ic N- and C-termini, as well as in the ''C1 domain'', a large loop between transmembrane helices six and seven which also extends into the cytoplasm.

==Regulation==
Adenylate cyclase is stimulated by [[G protein]]s, and by [[forskolin]], as well as other class-specific substrates. The classes I, III and VIII are also regulated by [[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[calmodulin]]. In [[neuron]]s, adenylate cyclases are located next to calcium [[ion channel]]s for faster reaction to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx; they are suspected of playing an important role in learning processes. This is supported by the fact that adenylate cyclases are ''coincidence detectors'', meaning that they are only activated by several different signals occurring together.

'''Autoeroticism''' is the practice of fulfilling one's own sexual needs without a partner. The most common form of autoeroticism is [[masturbation]]. Many people also use [[dildo]]s, [[vibrator]]s, anal beads, [[sybian machine]]s, and other [[sex toy]]s alone.

Most autoerotic practices are relatively or entirely safe. 

One example of a dangerous practice is [[autoerotic asphyxiation]]. It may result in death, particularly when done alone.

[[Self-bondage]] is the practice of [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]] by oneself; it carries a higher risk than bondage with a partner, and there is a large potential for things to go wrong.
