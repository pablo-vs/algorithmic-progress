      <text xml:space="preserve">:''Apuleius should not be confused with [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]], a Roman demagogue or with [[Pseudo-Apuleius]], an author.''
'''Lucius Apuleius''' (c. A.D. [[123]]/[[125|5]] - c. A.D. [[180]]), an utterly [[Roman Empire|Romanized]] [[Berber]] who described himself as &quot;half-[[Numidia|Numidian]] half-[[Gaetulia|Gaetulian]]&quot;, is remembered most for his bawdy [[Picaresque novel|picaresque]] [[Latin]] [[novel]] ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' or, in Latin, the '''Aureus Asinus''' (where the Latin word ''aureus'' - golden - connoted an element of blessed luckiness).

He was born in [[Madaurus]] (now [[Mdaourouch]], [[Algeria]]), a [[Roman colony]] in Numidia on the North African coast, bordering Gaetulia; this is the same ''[[colonia]]'' where [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] later received part of his early education, and, though located well away from the Romanized coast, is today the site of some pristine Roman ruins. Details regarding his life come mostly from his defense speech (see below) and a work entitled &quot;Florida,&quot; which consists of snippets taken from some of his best speeches.  There is also a desire on the part of many to take details from his seemingly autobiographical novel and apply them to Apuleius, but this is not a reliable source -- most notably, the novel is misused as evidence that Apuleius was a worshiper of [[Isis]], though there is good reason to think that this was not the case.  (Another dubious conclusion is that &quot;Lucius,&quot; the first name of the main character of the novel, was also the first name of Apuleius -- wishful thinking for which there is no concrete evidence.)

Apuleius inherited a substantial fortune from his father, a provincial magistrate. Apuleius studied with a master at [[Carthage]] and later at [[Athens]], where he studied [[Platonic philosophy]] among other subjects. He subsequently went to [[Rome]] to study [[Latin]] [[oratory]] and, most likely, to declaim in the law courts for a time before returning to his native North Africa. He also travelled extensively in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Egypt]], studying [[philosophy]] and [[religion]], burning up his inheritance while doing so.

After being accused of using [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] to gain the attentions (and fortune) of the wealthy widow he married (the mother of a school chum from his days in Athens), he declaimed and then distributed a witty ''tour de force'' in his own defense before the [[proconsul]] and a court of magistrates convened in [[Sabratha]], near [[Tripoli]], the ''Apologia (A Discourse on Magic)''. The work has very little to do with magic, and a lot to do with making mincemeat of his opponents, with hilarity and panache. It is among the funniest works that have come down to us from Antiquity -- it is certainly the most entertaining example of Latin courtroom oratory to survive, though some fans of Cicero might disagree -- and firmly places Apuleius among the great humorists of his day.

His other works include ''On the God of Socrates'', ''Florida'', ''On Plato and his Doctrine'', and possibly ''On the Universe''. 

''The Golden Ass'' is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety. It is an imaginative, irreverent, and amusing work that relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who experiments in magic and is accidentally turned into an [[donkey|ass]]. In this guise he hears and sees many unusual things, until escaping from his predicament in a rather unexpected way (see SPOILER below). Within this [[frame story]] are found multiple [[story within a story|digressions]], the longest among them being the well-known tale of [[Cupid and Psyche]].

{{spoiler}}

The ending of &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; is unexpected, and should not be spoiled for those who have not read the book.  However, since it is an important aspect of Apuleius's masterpiece, it cannot be omitted from this site -- thus the use of this warning.

&quot;The Golden Ass&quot; ends with the hero, Lucius, being rescued by Isis and transformed back from his donkey form.  Lucius subsequently becomes a worshiper of Isis, and Apuleius provides a lengthy account of his initiation into the [[mystery religion|mysteries]] of [[Isis]], which some see as [[autobiography|autobiographical]].  But Apuleius need not have been a worshiper of Isis to know the details he provides, and this work is more likely to belong to a sub-genre of stories involving rescue by Isis.  It is even possible that he is mocking such intensely devout worshipers of the goddess.

'''Alexander Selkirk''', born '''Alexander Selcraig''', ([[1676]]&amp;ndash;[[13 December]] [[1721]]) was a sailor who spent four years as a [[castaway]] on an uninhabited island; he is supposed to be the prototype of [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe's]] ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''.
==Biography==
===Early life===
The son of a shoemaker and [[tanning|tanner]] in [[Lower Largo]], [[Fife]], [[Scotland]], he was born in 1676. In his youth he displayed a quarrelsome and unruly disposition, and having been summoned on [[27 August]] [[1695]] before the kirk-session for his &quot;''undecent carriage''&quot; (indecent behaviour) in church, &quot;''did not compear [appear], having gone away to &amp;thorn;e sea: this bussiness is continued till his return''&quot; ([[quotation]] in original [[spelling]]). 

At an early period he was engaged in [[buccaneer]] expeditions to the South Seas, and in [[1703]] joined famed [[privateer]] and [[exploration|explorer]] [[William Dampier]] on the [[galleon]] ''Cinque Ports'' as sailing master. The following year, in [[October]], the ''[[Cinque Ports (1703 ship)|Cinque Ports]]'' was stopped over at the uninhabited [[archipelago]] of [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernández]] for a mid-expedition restock of supplies and fresh water.  At this point, Selkirk had grave concerns about the seaworthiness of his vessel (the ''Cinque Ports'', later sank, losing most hands) and opted to stay ashore, banking on an impending visit by another ship.  His decision spawned almost immediate regret. He chased and called after his boat to no avail; Selkirk spent a solitary residence of four years and four months on [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernández]].  He took with him a [[musket]], [[gunpowder]], [[carpenter|carpenter's]] tools, a knife, a Bible, and his clothing. 
===Cast away life===
Selkirk initially stayed on the beach, fearing strange inland sounds he assumed to be dangerous beasts.  During this period, he camped in a small cave, consumed [[shellfish]] for nutrition, surveyed the ocean each day for a possible rescue, and suffered from deep loneliness, depression, and regret.  Eventual hordes of [[sea lion]]s, collecting on the beach for their mating and weaning season, drove him to the island's interior. 

There, life became significantly better.  A bevy of new food sources became available: [[Wild Goat|wild goats]], introduced by earlier sailors, provided [[meat]] and [[milk]]; uncultivated [[turnips]], [[cabbage]], and [[black pepper|pepper]] berries offered diversity and spice.  [[Rat]]s, also not native, were an initial problem -- they made a habit of gnawing on Selkirk during the night. However, by domesticating and living near equally feral [[cat]]s, he was able to sleep soundly. 

Selkirk made extraordinary use of the equipment he took from the ship and, later, that which he made from island materials.  He carpentered two [[hut]]s out of native [[Pimento tree]]s and employed his musket and knife to hunt and clean goats. However, when his gunpowder dwindled, he had to resort to chasing his prey on foot. This resulted in a major injury wherein he tumbled off a cliff and was rendered unconscious for about twenty four hours (his prey had unwittingly intervened, sparing him a broken back).{{ref|fall}}  He also read from the [[Bible]] frequently, finding it beneficial to his emotional state and grasp of English.  When Selkirk's clothing wore out, he fashioned new garments from goatskin using a [[nail]] to sew.  His father was a tanner, and the lessons he had learned as a child helped him greatly on the island.  When his shoes were no longer usable, Selkirk's feet had become so toughened and calloused that he found them unnecessary.  He forged a new knife out of iron barrel rings left on the beach.

Two vessels arrived and departed before his escape; both were [[Spain|Spanish]].  As a [[Scotland|Scotsman]] and [[privateer]], he faced a fate worse than death if captured.  Selkirk hid from both crews.

The long awaited rescue occurred on [[2 February]] [[1709]] by way of privateer ''Duke'', a ship piloted by the same William Dampier mentioned earlier. Selkirk was discovered off the island by the ''Duke''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Captain]], [[Woodes Rogers]], who called him the Governor of the island. Upon being found, the four year castaway was completely incoherent with joy. The agile Selkirk caught two or three goats a day, helping restore the health of Rogers's men.  Rogers eventually made Selkirk his mate and gave him the independent command of one of his prizes. Rogers's ''A cruising voyage round the world: first to the South-Sea, thence to the East-Indies, and homewards by the Cape of Good Hope'' was published in [[1712]], with an account of Selkirk's ordeal. 

In 1717 Selkirk had returned to Lower Largo, but only stayed a few months. There he met Sophia Bruce, a sixteen year old dairymaid, and they eloped to [[London]]. Within a year he had again gone to sea. On a visit to [[Plymouth]], he married a widowed innkeeper. According to the ship's [[data logging|log]], he died at 8 p.m. on [[December 13]], [[1721]] while [[lieutenant]] on board the Royal ship ''[[Weymouth]]'', probably succumbing to the [[yellow fever]] which had devastated the voyage. He was buried at sea off the west coast of [[Africa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''anti-ballistic missile''' (ABM) is a [[missile]] designed to counter [[ballistic missile]]s. A ballistic missile is used to deliver [[nuclear weapon| nuclear]], [[Chemical warfare| chemical]], [[Biological warfare| biological]] or conventional [[warhead]]s in a [[External ballistics|ballistic]] flight [[trajectory]]. The term &quot;anti-ballistic missile&quot; describes any antimissile system designed to counter ballistic missiles. However the term is more commonly used for ABM systems designed to counter long range, nuclear-armed [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs).

Only two ABM systems have previously been operational against ICBMs, the U.S. [[Safeguard (nuke)| Safeguard]] system, and the Russian A-35 system which used the Galosh interceptor. Safeguard was only briefly operational; the Russian system has been improved and is still active, now called A-135 and using two missile types, Gorgon and Gazelle. However the U.S. [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]] (GMD, previously called [[National Missile Defense|NMD]]) system has recently reached initial operational capability. 

Three shorter range tactical ABM systems are currently operational: the U.S. [[MIM-104 Patriot| Patriot]], Navy [[Aegis combat system]]/[[Standard missile| Standard SM-3]], and the Israeli [[Arrow missile| Arrow]]. The longer-range U.S. [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense]] (THAAD) system is scheduled for deployment in 2011. In general short-range tactical ABMs cannot intercept ICBMs, even if within range. The tactical ABM radar and performance characteristics do not allow it, as an incoming ICBM warhead moves much faster than a tactical missile warhead. However it's possible the higher performance THAAD missile could be upgraded to intercept ICBMs.

Latest versions of the U.S. [[MIM-23 Hawk| Hawk missile]] have a limited capability against tactical ballistic missiles, but is usually not described as an ABM.

For current US developments, see [[Missile Defense Agency]]. For other short-range missiles, see [[Sea Wolf missile|Sea Wolf]], [[MBDA Aster|Aster 15]] and [[Crotale missile]].

==Early history of ABMs==
=== From World War II through the 1950s===
The idea of shooting down rockets before they can hit their target dates from the first use of modern missiles in warfare, the German [[V-1]] and [[V-2]] program of [[World War II]]. British and American fighters attempted to destroy V-1 &quot;buzz bombs&quot; in flight prior to impact, with some success. The V-2, the first true ballistic missile, proved impossible to intercept using [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]s and similar craft. Instead, the Allies launched [[Operation Crossbow]] to find and destroy V-2s before launch. The operation was largely ineffective, as was a similar operation during the first [[Persian_gulf|Persian]] [[Gulf War]] nearly fifty years later against the V-2's direct descendant, the Iraqi [[Scud]] missile.

The American armed forces began experimenting with anti-missile missiles shortly after World War II, as the extent of German research into rocketry became clear. But defenses against Soviet long-range bombers took priority until the later 1950s, when the Soviets began to test their missiles (most notably via the [[Sputnik program|Sputnik]] launch in October 1957). The first experimental ABM system was [[Project Nike|Nike Zeus]], a modification of existing air defense systems. Nike Zeus proved unworkable, and so work proceeded with [[Project Nike|Nike X]].

[[Image:NIKE Zeus.jpg|thumb|right|Launch of a Nike Zeus missile]]

Another avenue of research by the U.S. was the test explosions of several [[hydrogen bomb]]s at very high altitudes over the southern Atlantic ocean, launched from ships. When such an explosion takes place a burst of [[X-ray]]s are released that strike the Earth's atmosphere, causing secondary showers of charged particles over an area hundreds of miles across. The movement of these charged particles in the Earth's magnetic field causes a powerful [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] which induces very large currents in any conductive material. The idea was to destroy any electronics on the warheads. The project was found to be unworkable, although the exact reasons are not given.

Other countries were also involved in early ABM research. A more advanced project was at [[DRE Valcartier|CARDE]] in [[Canada]], which rearched the main problems of ABM systems. This included developing several advanced [[infrared]] detectors for terminal guidance, a number of missile airframe designs, a new and much more powerful solid rocket fuel, and numerous systems for testing it all. After a series of drastic budget cuts in the late 1950s the research wound down. One offshoot of the project was [[Gerald Bull]]'s system for inexpensive high-speed testing, consisting of missile airframes fired from a [[sabot]] round, which would later form the basis of [[Project HARP]].

==Developments in the 1960s and 1970s==
===Nike-X, Sentinel and Safeguard===
[[Image:meck6.jpg|thumb|185px|Dual launch of Sprint missiles during a salvo test at [[Meck|Meck island]] ]]
Nike X was a US system of two missiles, radars and their associated control systems. The original Nike Zeus (later called Spartan) was upgraded for longer range and a much larger 5 megatonne warhead intended to destroy warheads with a burst of x-rays outside the atmosphere. A second shorter-range missile called [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] with very high acceleration was added to handle warheads that evaded longer-ranged Spartan. Sprint was a very fast missile (some sources claimed it accelerated to 8,000 mph within 4 seconds of flight--an average acceleration of ''100 [[g]]''!) and had a smaller W66 [[Neutron bomb|enhanced radiation]] warhead in the 1-3 kiloton range for in-atmosphere interceptions. 

The new Spartan changed the deployment plans as well. Previously the Nike systems were to have been clustered near cities as a last-ditch defense, but the Spartan allowed for interceptions at hundreds of miles range. Therefore the basing changed to provide almost complete coverage of the United States in a system known as [[Safeguard (nuke)|Sentinel]]. Later Sentinel was restructured to a more limited defense of ICBM sites against incoming warheads. That system used the same Spartan/Sprint missiles and radar, and was called [[Safeguard (nuke)| Safeguard]].

===Moscow ABM system===
The only other ICBM ABM system to reach production was the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] A-35 system. It was initially a single-layer exoatmospheric (outside the atmosphere) design, using the Galosh (SH-01/ABM-1) interceptor. It was deployed at four sites around [[Moscow]] in the early 1970s. 

Originally intended to be a larger deployment, the system was downsized to the two sites allowed under the 1972 ABM treaty.  It was upgraded in the 1980s to a two-layer system. The Gorgon (SH-11/ABM-4) long-range missile was designed to handle intercepts outside the atmosphere, and the Gazelle (SH-08/ABM-3) short-range missile endoatmospheric intercepts that eluded Gorgon. In general the system is thought to have capabilities similar to that of the former U.S. Safeguard system.

===The problem of defense against MIRVs===
[[Image:Peacekeeper-missile-testing.jpg|thumb|right|Testing of the [[LGM-118A Peacekeeper]] re-entry vehicles, all eight fired from only one missile. Each line represents the path of a warhead which, were it live, would detonate with the explosive power of twenty-five [[Little Boy|Hiroshima-style]] weapons.]]
ABM systems were initially developed to counter single warheads from large [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). The economics seemed simple enough: since rocket costs increase rapidly with size, interceptor cost should be less than the attacking ICBMs (which had much longer range and heavier payloads). In an arms race the defense would always win.

Things changed dramatically with the introduction of [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]] (MIRV) warheads. Suddenly each launcher was throwing not one warhead, but several. The defense would still require a rocket for every warhead, as they would be re-entering over a wide space and could not be attacked by several warheads from a single antimissile rocket. Suddenly the defense was more expensive than offense: it was much less expensive to add more warheads, or even decoys, than it was to build the interceptor needed to shoot them down.

The experimental success of Nike X persuaded the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administration to propose a thin ABM defense. In a September 1967 speech, Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] described it as [[Safeguard (nuke)| Sentinel]]. McNamara, a private ABM opponent because of cost and feasibility (see [[cost-exchange ratio]]), claimed that Sentinel would be directed not against the Soviet Union's missiles (since the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] had more than enough missiles to overwhelm any American defense), but rather against the potential nuclear threat of the [[People's Republic of China]]. 

In the meantime a public debate over the merit of ABMs broke out. Even before the MIRV problem made ABM effectiveness non-workable in the late [[1960s]], some technical difficulties had already made an ABM system questionable for a large sophisticated attack. One problem was the [[Fractional Orbital Bombardment System]] (FOBS) that would give little warning to the defense. Another problem was high altitude EMP (whether from offensive or defensive nuclear warheads) which could degrade defensive radar systems.

Technical difficulties aside, the debate turned to an odd position: that no defense at all was better than any defense. Namely,  a false sense of security might encourage ABM-defended nations to escalate against minor threats, believing they would be protected against any response. By this reasoning simply starting to deploy such a system could prompt a full-scale attack before it could become operational and thereby render such an attack useless. This curious set of arguments thus put the system in a terrible position: it couldn't possibly work, but if it did that would be even worse.

===The ABM Treaty of 1972===
Various technical, economic and political problems led to the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty|ABM treaty]] of 1972, which restricted the deployment of strategic (not tactical) antiballistic missiles.

Under the ABM treaty and a 1974 revision, each country was allowed to deploy a single ABM system with only 100 interceptors to protect a single target. The Soviets deployed a system named A-35 (using Galosh interceptors), designed to protect Moscow. The U.S. deployed [[Safeguard (nuke)| Safeguard ]] (using Spartan/Sprint interceptors) to defend ballistic missile sites at Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, in 1975. The U.S. Safeguard system was only briefly operational. The Russian system (now called A-135) has been improved and is still active around Moscow. On June 13, 2002, the US withdrew from the treaty.

Why did the Soviets and Americans accept the treaty?

* Deployment of even a limited defensive system might well invite a pre-emptive nuclear attack before it could be implemented
* Soviet leaders suspected that the United States, with its mammoth resources and technological superiority, might well be able to create a leakproof defense. 
* Deploying ABM systems would likely invite another expensive arms race for defensive systems, in addition to maintaining existing offensive expenditures
* Then-current technology did not permit a thorough defense against a sophisticated attack
* Concerns that use of nuclear warheads on antimissile interceptors would degrade capability of defensive radar, thus possibly rendering defense ineffective after the first few intercepts
* In the U.S, political and public concern of detonating defensive nuclear warheads over friendly territory
* An ICBM defense could jeopardize the [[Mutual assured destruction|Mutually Assured Destruction]] concept, thus being a destabilizing influence

In an ironic twist, this limitation of defensive arms eventually led to treaties limiting the construction of offensive arms, known as the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT I]] treaties.

Although designed and ratified under Republican President Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger,  conservatives in the United States generally remained opposed to the ABM Treaty.

==ABM developments in the 1980s and Persian Gulf War==
The [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-era [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (better known as &quot;Star Wars&quot;), along with research into various energy-beam weaponry, brought new interest in the area of ABM technologies.  

SDI was an extremely ambitious program to provide a total shield against a massive Soviet ICBM attack. The initial concept envisioned large sophisticated orbiting laser battle stations, space-based relay mirrors, and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites. Later research indicated that some planned technologies such as X-ray [[Laser]]s were not feasible with then-current technology. As research continued, SDI evolved through various concepts as designers struggled with the difficulty of such a large complex defense system. SDI remained a research program and was never deployed. However several SDI technologies were used in follow on ABM systems.

The [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot antiaircraft missiles]] was the first deployed tactical ABM system, although it was not designed from the outset for that task and consequently had limitations. It was used in the 1991 Gulf War to attempt to intercept Iraqi [[Scud]] missiles.  Post-war analyses show that the Patriot much less effective than initially thought because of its radar and control system's inability to discriminate warheads from other objects when the Scud missiles broke up during reentry. On the other hand, the Scud itself was highly inaccurate and not very reliable.  It was more a psychological than real threat to military targets.
&lt;!--(See new 1990s section. The arrow system doesn't require hit-to-kill and is non-nuclear which contradicts this section)
&lt;!--(You're right, I fixed it.- joema 23-Feb-06)Testing of ABMs and ABM technology continued through the 1990s with mixed success.  Use of non-nuclear interceptors requires that the interceptor physically contact the incoming payload -- a much more difficult problem.  There are also many unresolved issues with warhead discrimination and decoy deployment.  There is little doubt that occasional intercepts are possible.  The issue is whether an ABM system is a cost effective deterrent or whether a potential enemy will simply deploy a few more missiles with more warheads.--&gt;

==Post Gulf War ABM developments in the 1990s==
===Tactical ABMs deployed===
[[Image:Navy Theater Ballistic Missile Defense.JPG|thumb|right|230px|Developed in th late 1990s, the Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile (LEAP) attaches to a modified [[Standard missile|SM-2 Block IV missile]] used by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]]]
&lt;!--[http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/nmd/index.html FAS] also has a time line for ABM/NMB/TBMD starting in [http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/milestone.htm Missie Defense Milestones]--&gt;
Testing of ABMs and ABM technology continued through the 1990s with mixed success. However, following the Gulf War, improvements were made to several U.S. air defense systems. [[MIM-104 Patriot| Patriot PAC-3]] was developed and tested following the Gulf War. The PAC-3 is a complete redesign of the system deployed during the war, including a totally new missile. The improved guidance, radar and missile performance improves the probablility of kill over the earlier PAC-2. In operation Iraqi Freedom, the Patriot PAC-3 had a near 100% sucess rate at intercepting short range [[tactical ballistic missile]]s (TBMs). However since no longer range Iraqi [[Scud]] missiles were fired, PAC-3 effectiveness againt those was untested. Also the PAC-3 was involved in two [[fratricide]] incidents: two incidents of Patriot firings at coalition aircraft and one of U.S. aircraft firing on a Patriot battery [http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2005-01-Patriot_Report_Summary.pdf].

From 1992 to 2000 a demonstration system for the US Army [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense]] was deployed at [[White Sands Missile Range]]. Tests were conducted on a regular basis and resulted in early failures, but successful intercepts occurred in 1999. A new version of the Hawk missile was tested in the early to mid 90's and by the end of 1998 the majority of US Marine Corps [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk]] systems were modified to support basic theater anti-ballistic missile capabilities[http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/hawk.htm].  Following the Gulf war, the [[Aegis combat system]] was expanded to include ABM capabilities. The [[Standard missile]] system was also enhanced and tested for ballistic missile interception. In the late 90's SM-2 block IVA missiles were tested in a theater ballistic missile defense role.[http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/sm2.htm] Standard Missile 3 (SM3) systems have also been tested for an ABM role. In 1998, Defense secretary William Cohen proposed spending an additional $6.6 billion on ballistic missile defense programs to build a system to protect against attacks from North Korea or accidental launches from Russia or China[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/military/jan-june99/nmd_1-28a.html].  The [[Israel]]i [[Arrow missile|Arrow]] system was initially tested in 1990, before the first Gulf War. The Arrow was supported by the United States throughout the nineties.

===Brilliant Pebbles===
Approved for acquisition by the Pentagon in 1991 but never realized, Brilliant Pebbles was a proposed space-based anti-ballistic system that tried to avoid some of the problems of the earlier SDI concepts. Rather than use sophisticated large laser battle stations and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites, Brilliant Pebbles consisted of a thousand very small, highly intelligent orbiting satellites with kinetic warheads. The system relied on advances in computer technology, avoided problems with overly centralized command and control and risky, expensive development of large, complicated space defense satellites. It promised to be much less expensive to develop and have less technical development risk.

The name Brilliant Pebbles comes from the small size of the satellite interceptors and great computational power enabling more autonomous targeting. Rather than rely exclusively on ground-based control, the many small interceptors would cooperatively communicate among themselves and target a large swarm of ICBM warheads in space or in the late boost phase. Development was later discontinued in favor of a limited ground-based defense.

===SDI changed to NMD===
In the early 1990s, President G. H. W. Bush called for a more limited version using rocket-launched interceptors based on the ground at a single site. In 1993, SDI was reorganized as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. Deployment of the more limited system, called the National Missile Defense (NMD) was planned to protect all 50 states from a rogue missile attack. Research and development of the NMD system continued under the Clinton administration from 1992 to 2000.

==Current ABM developments==
A renewed interest in missile defense cooincided with the election of President [[George W. Bush]] in 2000. In several tests, the U.S. military has  demonstrated the feasibility of shooting down long and short range ballistic missiles. Combat effectivness of newer systems against tactical ballistic missiles seems very high, as the [[MIM-104 Patriot| Patriot PAC-3]] had a 100% success rate in Operation Iraqi Freedom. However NMD real-world effectiveness against longer range ICBMs is less clear.

While the Reagan era Strategic Defense Initiative was intended to shield against a massive Soviet attack, the current [[National Missile Defense]] has the more limited goal of shielding against a limited attack by a [[rogue state]].  

The Bush administration has accelerated development and deployment of a system proposed in 1998 by the Clinton administration.  The system is a dual purpose test and interception facility in Alaska, and as of 2006 is operational with a few interceptor missiles. The Alaska site provides more protection against North Korean missiles or accidental launches from Russia or China, but is likely less effective against missiles launched from Iran. The Alaska interceptors may be later augmented by the naval [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System]], by ground-based missiles in other locations, or by the [[Boeing YAL-1| Boeing Airborne Laser]]. President Bush has referenced the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks]] and the proliferation of ballistic missiles as reasons for missile defense.

&lt;!-- (Seems POV and a broad generalization, and I can't find a source for it. Please cite source and uncomment) Often overlooked in the ABM debate in the United States is the resistance of many Pentagon leaders to the construction of a National Missile Defense.  Admirals and generals of all services oppose spending huge sums (currently $8bn/yr in 2003) to research, develop, and procure NMD systems.  They would prefer to have that money spent on new conventional weapons, training, equipment, or pay. By conventional [[procurement]] methodologies ([[cost-benefit analysis]] and [[cost-utility analysis]]) missile defense would be regarded as a 'bad buy' owing to its very high costs, high level of project risk (it is essentially a research project, not acquisition of proven technologies) and the benefits are disputed. In order to prevent its cancellation by the Pentagon, successive administrations have placed missile defense outside of direct Pentagon control in a separate organisation.--&gt;

===International ABM efforts===
[[Image:Arrow missle.jpg|thumb|right|An Arrow anti-ballistic missile interceptor]]
In 1993, a symposium was held by western European nations to explore potential future ballistic missile defense programs. In the end, the council recommended deployment of early warning and surveillance systems as well as regionally controlled defense systems. [http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/europe/weu_93/weu1363tasc.htm] In 1998 the [[Israel]]i military conducted a successful test of their [[Arrow missile|Arrow ABM]], developed in Israel with American assistance. Designed to intercept incoming missiles traveling at up to 2 mile/s (3 km/s), the Arrow is expected to perform much better than the Patriot did in the Gulf War. [[Taiwan]] is also engaged in the development of an anti-ballistic missile system, based on its indigenously developed Tien Kung-II (Sky Bow) SAM system. Although reports suggest a promising system, the ROC government continues to show strong interest towards the American [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense]] (THAAD) program.

      <comment>revert: &quot;pole&quot; is a linear measure, not area.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the unit of measure known as the ''acre''.  For other definitions, see [[Acre (disambiguation)]].''

An '''acre''' is an [[English unit]] of area, which is also frequently used in the United States and some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. It is most often used to describe areas of land.

== UK definition ==
The UK has a definition in the system of [[Imperial unit]]s of the acre in [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19951804_en_2.htm The Units of Measurement Regulations 1995] as 4,046.8564224 [[metre|m²]]. This is equivalent to 43,560&amp;nbsp;square feet using the definition of foot in the same source.

== U.S. customary units ==
The [[U.S. customary units]] definition of the acre in [http://ts.nist.gov/ts/htdocs/230/235/appxc/appxc.htm NIST Handbook 44] is 43,560.0 [[square foot|square feet]]. However, the U.S. has two definitions of foot (''international foot'' and ''survey foot'') and thus two definitions of acre:
* The ''international acre'' is 4,046.8564224 m². This is based on ''international foot'' of 0.3048 m.
* The U.S. ''survey acre'' is 4,046.87261 m². This is based on the U.S. ''survey foot'' of &lt;sup&gt;1200&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3937&lt;/sub&gt; m.

==Related linear measurements==
Two obsolete, but related, measurements are the acre's length and the acre's breadth.  
*1 acre's length = 1 [[furlong]], 40 [[pole (length)|poles]], or 220 yards
*1 acre's breadth = 1 [[chain (unit)|chain]], 4 poles, or 22 yards

== Conversion ==
An international acre may be [[Conversion of units|converted]] to other units because it is equivalent to exactly:
* 4,046.8564224 [[metre|m²]] (SI unit)
* 40.468564224 [[Are|a]],
* 0.40468564224 [[hectare|ha]],
* 43,560 square feet,
* 4,840 square [[yard]]s,
* 160 square [[rod (unit)|rod]]s,
* 4 [[rood]],
* 1/640 [[square mile]],
* a 10:1 rectangle of 1 [[furlong]] by 1 [[chain (length)|chain]].
* 10 square chains.

An acre is equivalent to approximately:
* a square of side 208.71 [[feet]] (63.61 [[metre]]s).

One [[square mile]] is 640 acres. A square parcel of land ¼ mile wide is 40 acres. A square parcel of land ½ mile on a side is 160 acres, the usual land tract under the [[Homestead Act]] in the [[United States]]. This results in common field lengths of ½ mile, with every [[rod (unit)|rod]] in width equal to one acre.

One acre is slightly less than 91 yards on an [[American Football]] field, with the full field, including the end zones, covering approximately 1.32 acres.

==History==
The acre was selected as approximately the amount of land tillable by one man behind an [[ox]] in one [[day]]. This explains its rectangular definition one-[[chain (length)|chain]] by one-[[furlong]] parcel of land; a long narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot, since the plough does not have to be turned so often. Statutory values were enacted in England by acts of 
* [[Edward I of England|Edward I]],
* [[Edward III of England|Edward III]],
* [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]],
* [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and
* [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] - the British &quot;Weights and Measures Act&quot; of [[1878]] defined it as containing 4,840 square yards.

In the UK use of acres is officially discouraged, but it is still a very familiar measure of land with the general public, especially middle-aged and elderly people.
Acre is measured on &quot;flat plane&quot;, therefore land that is steeply sloped may contain more area than one acre while actually being only one acre on a map.

&lt;!-- TEXT --&gt;
'''Adenosine 5'-triphosphate''' ('''ATP''') is a multifunctional [[nucleotide]] primarily known in [[biochemistry]] as the &quot;[[molecule|molecular]] currency&quot; of intracellular [[energy]] transfer. In this role ATP transports chemical energy within [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. It is produced as an energy source during the processes of [[photosynthesis]] and [[cellular respiration]]. ATP is also one of four monomers required for the synthesis of [[ribonucleic acid]]s. Furthermore, in signal transduction pathways, ATP is used to provide the phosphate for protein-kinase reactions.

==Chemical properties==
ATP consists of [[adenosine]] and three [[phosphate]] groups (triphosphate). The phosphoryl groups, starting with that on [[adenosine monophosphate|AMP]], are referred to as the alpha (&amp;alpha;), beta (β), and gamma (&amp;gamma;) phosphates.  ATP is extremely rich in chemical energy, in particular between the second and third phosphate groups.  The net change in energy of the decomposition of ATP into [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and an inorganic phosphate is -12 kCal / mole ''in vivo'' (inside of a living cell) and -7.3 kCal / mole ''in vitro'' (in laboratory conditions).  This massive release in energy makes the decomposition of ATP extremely [[exergonic]], and hence useful as a means for chemically storing energy.

==Synthesis==
[[Image:Atp_space_filling_ray_trace.jpg|200px|thumb|Space filling image of ATP]]
ATP can be produced by various cellular processes: Under aerobic conditions, the majority of the synthesis occurs in [[mitochondria]] during [[oxidative phosphorylation]] and is catalyzed by [[ATP synthase]] and, to a lesser degree, under anaerobic conditions by [[fermentation]]. 

The main fuels for ATP synthesis are [[glucose]] and [[triglyceride]]s. The fuels that result from the breakdown of triglycerides are [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acid]]s.

First, glucose and glycerol are metabolised to [[pyruvate]] in the [[cytosol]] using the [[glycolysis|glycolyitic]] pathway.  This generates some ATP through [[substrate-level phosphorylation|substrate phosphorylation]] catalyzed by two enzymes: [[Phosphoglycerate kinase|PGK]] and [[Pyruvate kinase]]. Pyruvate is then oxidised further in the [[mitochondrion]].

In the mitochondrion, pyruvate is oxidised by [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] to [[acetyl-CoA]], which is fully oxidised to carbon dioxide by the [[Krebs cycle]]. Fatty acids are also broken down to acetyl CoA by [[beta-oxidation]] and metabolised by the Krebs cycle. Every turn of the Krebs cycle produces an ATP equivalent (GTP) through [[substrate-level phosphorylation|substrate phosphorylation]] catalyzed by [[Succinyl-CoA synthetase]] as well as reducing power as NADH. The electrons from NADH are used by the [[electron transport chain]] to generate a large amount of ATP by [[oxidative phosphorylation]] coupled with ATP synthase.

The whole process of oxidising glucose to carbon dioxide is known as [[cellular respiration]] and is more than 40% efficient at transfering the chemical energy in glucose to the more useful form of ATP.

ATP is also synthesized through several so-called &quot;replenishment&quot; reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of NDKs ([[nucleoside diphosphate kinase]]s), which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high-energy phosphate donor, and the ATP:guanido-phosphotransferase family, which uses [[creatine]].

::[[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] + [[guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; ATP + [[guanosine diphosphate|GDP]]

In plants, ATP is synthesized in [[chloroplast]]s during the light reactions of [[photosynthesis]]. Some of this ATP is then used to power the [[Calvin cycle]], which synthesizes [[triose]] sugars.

If a [[clot]] causes a decrease in [[oxygen]] delivery to the [[cell]], the amount of '''ATP''' produced in the [[mitochondria]] will decrease.

==Function==
ATP energy is released when [[hydrolysis]] of the [[high energy phosphate|phosphate-phosphate]] bonds is carried out. This energy can be used by a variety of [[enzyme]]s, [[motor protein]]s, and [[transport protein]]s to carry out the work of the cell. Also, the hydrolysis yields free inorganic [[phosphate|P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], which can be broken down further to another P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and [[adenosine monophosphate|AMP]]. ATP can also be broken down to AMP directly, with the formation of [[pyrophosphate|PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]]. This last reaction has the advantage of being an effectively irreversible process in [[aqueous]] [[solution]].

==ATP in the human body==
The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.1 [[Mole (unit)|mole]]. The energy used by human cells requires the [[hydrolysis]] of 200 to 300 moles of ATP daily. This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 2000 to 3000 times during a single day. ATP cannot be stored, hence its consumption must closely follow its synthesis. On a per-hour basis, 1 kilogram of ATP is created, processed and then recycled in the body.

==Other uses==
There is talk of using ATP as a [[power (physics)|power]] source for [[nanotechnology]] and implants. [[Artificial pacemaker]]s could become independent of [[battery (electricity)|batteries]]. ATP is also present as a neurotransmitter independent from its energy-containing function. Receptors that utilise ATP as their [[ligand]] are known as purinoceptors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about a mythological figure. For the software, see [[Aegir (software)]]; for the [[tidal bore]] on the English River Trent see [[River Trent]].''

'''Ægir''' is a [[jotun|giant]] and a king of the sea in [[Norse mythology]]. He seems to be a personification of the power of the [[ocean]]. He was also known for throwing massive parties for the gods.

In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s [[Skáldskaparmál]] Ægir is identified with Gymir and Hlér who lived on [[Hlesey|Hlésey]]. Gymir, it may be noticed, is the name of the giant father of the beautiful [[Gerd|Gerðr]] wooed by [[Freyr]]. Another link between the [[Æsir]] and the sea giants is found in [[Hymir]], who is said in [[Hymiskviða]] to be father of [[Týr]]. 

Ægir is said to have had [[Daughters of Ægir|nine daughters]] with his wife, [[Rán]]. His daughters were called the billow maidens. They were named Bára, Blóðughadda, Bylgja, Dúfa, Hefring, Himinglæva, Hrönn, Kólga, and Unnr. The names of each reflect different types of waves of the sea.

Ægir is son of [[Fornjót]]r and brother of Logi (fire, flame) and Kári (wind). He is also called Hlér and Gymir. In the [[Lokasenna]], he has a festival for the gods, where he provides the ale brewed in an enormous pot provided by [[Thor]]. The story of Thor getting the pot for the brewing is told in the [[Hymiskviða]].

Ægir had two servants, Fimafengr (killed by Loki) and Eldir.

==Familiar forms==

Ægir's name is sometimes [[Old Norse orthography|anglicized]] as &quot;Aegir&quot; or &quot;Aeger&quot;. The common Swedish form is Ägir.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''antibiotic''' is a [[Medication|drug]] that kills or slows the growth of [[bacterium|bacteria]]. Antibiotics are one class of [[antimicrobial]]s, a larger group which also includes anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-parasitic drugs.  They are relatively harmless to the host, and therefore can be used to [[healthcare treatment|treat]] [[infection]]s. The term, coined by [[Selman Waksman]], originally described only those formulations derived from living organisms, in contradistinction to &quot;chemotherapeutic agents&quot;, which were purely synthetic. Nowadays the term &quot;antibiotic&quot; is also applied to [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] antimicrobials, such as the [[sulfonamide]]s. Antibiotics are small [[molecule]]s with a [[molecular weight]] less than 2000. They are not [[enzyme]]s.
Some antibiotics are made from mould.

Unlike previous treatments for infections, which included poisons such as [[strychnine]] and [[arsenic]], antibiotics were labelled &quot;magic bullets&quot;: [[medication|drugs]] which targeted disease without harming the host. Conventional antibiotics are not effective in [[virus|viral]], [[fungal]] and other nonbacterial infections, and individual antibiotics vary widely in their effectiveness on various types of bacteria. Antibiotics can be categorised based on their target specificity: 'narrow-spectrum' antibiotics target particular types of bacteria, such as [[Gram-negative]] or [[Gram-positive]] bacteria, while 'wide-spectrum' antibiotics affect a larger range of bacteria.

The effectiveness of individual antibiotics varies with the location of the infection, the ability of the antibiotic to reach the site of infection, and the ability of the bacteria to resist or inactivate the antibiotic. Some antibiotics actually kill the bacteria (bactericidal), whereas others merely prevent the bacteria from multiplying (bacteriostatic) so that the host's immune  system can overcome them.

Oral antibiotics are the simplest approach when effective, with intravenous antibiotics reserved for more serious cases. Antibiotics may sometimes be administered topically, as with eyedrops or ointments.

Antibiotics can also be classified by the organisms against which they are effective, and by the type of infection in which they are useful, which depends on the sensitivities of the organisms that most commonly cause the infection and the concentration of antibiotic obtainable in the affected tissue.

== History ==
:''See also: [[Timeline of antibiotics]]''

Many ancient cultures, including the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient China|ancient Chinese]], already used [[mould|moulds]] and other plants to treat [[infections|infection]]. This worked because some moulds produce antibiotic substances. However, they couldn't distinguish or distil the active component in the moulds. 

Modern research on antibiotics began with the discovery of [[Penicillin]] in [[1928]] by [[Alexander Fleming]].

== Production ==
:''Main article: [[Production of antibiotics]]''

Since the first pioneering efforts of [[Howard Walter Florey|Florey]] and [[Ernst Boris Chain|Chain]] in 1939, the importance of antibiotics to [[medicine]] has led to much research into discovering and producing them. The process of production usually involves screening of wide ranges of microorganisms, testing and modification. Production is carried out using [[fermentation]].

== Side effects ==
Possible side effects are varied, and range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions.  One of the more common side effects is [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]], which results from the antibiotic disrupting the normal balance of intestinal flora.  Other side effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as elevated risk of [[tendon]] damage from administration of a [[Quinolones|quinolone]] antibiotic with a systemic [[corticosteroid]].

Some antibiotics can interfere with the efficacy of birth control pills.  Such effects were found to be unusual, and have been studied only for a limited number of antibiotics.

== Antibiotic misuse ==
Common forms of antibiotic misuse include taking them in inappropriate situations, such as the use of antibacterials for viral infections such as the [[common cold]], and failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibiotic, usually because the patient feels better before the infecting organism is completely eradicated. In addition to treatment failure, these practices can result in [[antibiotic resistance]] in the bacteria that survive the abbreviated treatment.

In the United States, vast quantities of certain antibiotics are routinely included as low doses in the diet of some kinds of healthy farm animals, where this practice has been proved to make animals grow faster. Opponents of this practice, however, point out the likelihood that it also leads to an environment conductive to the evolution of antibiotic resistance, frequently in bacteria that are known to also infect humans. There has been little or no evidence as yet of the evolution of antibiotic resistance in such bacteria actually occurring. As the majority of bacteria is killed in the pasteurization process applied to the milk, and the cooking of the meat of such animals, any possible resistance may go unnoticed until the bacteria survives it. Theoretically, though, there is a significant possibility that such resistances could be transferred through the bacterial plasmids. Excessive use of [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] antibiotics in travellers may also be classified as misuse.

== Antibiotic resistance ==
:''Main article: [[Antibiotic resistance]]''

Use or misuse of antibiotics may result in the development of ''antibiotic resistance'' by the infecting organisms, similar to the development of [[pesticide resistance]] in insects. [[Evolutionary theory]] of [[selection|genetic selection]] requires that as close as possible to 100% of the infecting organisms be killed off to avoid selection of resistance; if a small subset of the population survives the treatment and is allowed to multiply, the average susceptibility of this new population to the compound will be much less than that of the original population, since they have descended from those few organisms which survived the original treatment. This survival often results from an inheritable resistance to the compound which was infrequent in the original population but is now much more frequent in the descendants thus selected entirely from those originally infrequent resistant organisms.  

Antibiotic resistance has become a serious problem in both the developed and underdeveloped nations. By 1984 half of the people with active [[tuberculosis]] in the [[United States]] had a strain that resisted at least one antibiotic. In certain settings, such as hospitals and some child-care locations, the rate of [[antibiotic resistance]] is so high that the normal, low cost antibiotics are virtually useless for treatment of frequently seen infections. This leads to more frequent use of newer and more expensive compounds, which in turn leads inexorably to the rise of resistance to those drugs, and a never-ending ever-spiralling race to discover new and different antibiotics ensues, just to keep us from losing ground in the battle against infection. The fear is that we will eventually fail to keep up in this race, and the time when people did not fear life-threatening bacterial infections will be just a memory of a golden era.
 
Another example of selection is ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', which could be treated successfully with penicillin in the 1940s and 1950s.  At present, nearly all strains are resistant to [[penicillin]], and many are resistant to [[nafcillin]], leaving only a narrow selection of drugs such as [[vancomycin]] useful for treatment. The situation is worsened by the fact that genes coding for antibiotic resistance can be transferred between bacteria, making it possible for bacteria never exposed to an antibiotic to acquire resistance from those which have. The problem of antibiotic resistance is worsened when antibiotics are used to treat disorders in which they have no efficacy, such as the common cold or other viral complaints, and when they are used widely as prophylaxis rather than treatment (as in, for example, animal feeds), because this exposes more bacteria to selection for resistance.

== Beyond antibiotics ==
Unfortunately, the comparative ease of finding compounds which safely cured bacterial infections proved much harder to duplicate with respect to fungal and viral infections. Antibiotic research led to great strides in our knowledge of basic biochemistry and to the current biological revolution; but in the process it was discovered that the susceptibility of bacteria to many compounds which are safe to humans is based upon significant differences between the cellular and molecular physiology of the bacterial cell and that of the mammalian cell. In contrast, despite the seemingly huge differences between fungi and humans, the basic biochemistries of the fungal cell and the mammalian cell are much more similar; so much so that there are few therapeutic opportunities for compounds to attack a fungal cell which will not harm a human cell. Similarly, we know now that viruses represent an incredibly minimal intracellular parasite, being stripped down to a few genes worth of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] and the minimal molecular equipment needed to enter a cell and actually take over the machinery of the cell to produce new viruses. Thus, the great bulk of viral metabolic biochemistry is not merely similar to human biochemistry, it actually is human biochemistry, and the possible targets of antiviral compounds are restricted to the relatively very few components of the actual virus itself.

Research into [[bacteriophage]]s is ongoing at the moment. Bacteriophages are a specific type of virus that only targets bacteria. Research suggests that nature has evolved several types of bacteriophage for each type of bacteria. While research into bacteriophages is only in its infancy the results are promising and have already lead to major advances in microscopic imaging (see [http://news.uns.purdue.edu/UNS/html4ever/2006/060201.Jiang.salmonella.html]). While bacteriophages provide a possible solution the problem of antibacterial resistance there is as of yet no proof that we will actually be able to deploy these microscopic killers in humans, we can only continue the research and see where it leads.

'''{{Audio|de_ArnoldSchwarzenegger.ogg|Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger}}'''  (born [[July 30]], [[1947]]) is an [[Austria|Austrian]]-[[United States|American]] [[bodybuilder]], [[Golden Globe]] award winning [[actor]], and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Politics of the United States|politician]], currently serving as the 38th [[Governor of California]]. He was elected on [[October 7]], [[2003]] in [[2003 California recall|a special recall election]] which removed the sitting governor, [[Gray Davis]], from office.  Schwarzenegger was sworn in on [[November 17]], [[2003]], to serve the remainder of Davis' term, which lasts until [[January 8]], [[2007]]. On September 16th, 2005 he officially announced that he will seek re-election to a full term in [[California gubernatorial election, 2006|California's 2006 gubernatorial election]].

Nicknamed &quot;The Austrian Oak&quot; in his body-building days, and more recently &quot;The Governator&quot; (a [[portmanteau]] of the words &quot;Governor&quot; and &quot;Terminator&quot;, after the film role), Schwarzenegger as a young man gained widespread attention as a highly successful bodybuilder, and later gained worldwide fame as a [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] [[action film]] star.  Some of his most famous films include ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[Predator (movie)|Predator]]'', ''[[True Lies]]'', ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'', ''[[Total Recall (film)|Total Recall]]'', and his Hollywood breakthrough film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''.  

==Personal background==
[[Image:Arnold military.jpg|framed|left|Arnold Schwarzenegger pictured next to an [[Patton tank|M47]] tank, which he was trained to operate.]]  &lt;!--Dates verified at http://www.bodybuildbid.com/articles/mrolympia/arnold-schwarzenegger.html--&gt;

Schwarzenegger was born in [[Thal, Austria]], a small town near the [[Styria|Styrian]] capital, [[Graz]], and christened Edward James Albetski. His parents were the local [[police chief]] and former [[Nazi stormtrooper]] [[Gustav Schwarzenegger]] (1907-1972), and his wife, the former Aurelia Jadrny (1922-1998), who had been married on [[October 20]], [[1945]], when he was 35 and she was 23 and widowed.
Gustav was a strict and demanding father, who generally favored the elder of his two sons, the handsome and blonde Meinhard.

Meinhard died in a car accident in 1971, and Gustav died the following year. Schwarzenegger attended neither's funeral. In ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' he claimed he did not attend his father's funeral as he was training for a bodybuilding contest, although both he and the film's producer later stated that this story was taken from another bodybuilder.

As a boy, Schwarzenegger played many sports, but discovered his passion for [[bodybuilding]] when in his mid-teens his [[soccer]] coach took the team for [[weight training]]. He attended a [[gym]] in Graz, where he also frequented the local [[Movie theater|cinema]]s, viewing his idols such as musclemen [[Reg Park]], [[Steve Reeves]], and [[Johnny Weissmuller]] on the big screen.

Arnold served in the [[Military of Austria|Austrian army]] in [[1965]], completing the mandatory one year service required at the time for all 18 year old Austrian men. During this year he snuck off the base to compete in his first bodybuilding competition, the junior division of Mr. Europe, where he won first place.

Schwarzenegger left Thal for a job managing a gym in [[Munich, Germany]], while continuing his bodybuilding.
He made his first plane trip in [[1966]], attending the [[NABBA Mr. Universe]] competition being held in [[London]]. He arrived in [[England]] knowing little English, and it was here he first started being referred to as &quot;The Austrian Oak&quot;, due to his large build and the story of him performing [[chin ups]] from the limb of an [[Oak tree]] on the banks of the river Thalersee, the lake of his hometown.
He would come second in the competition, but would win the title the next year, becoming the youngest ever Mr Universe at age 20.

Schwarzenegger moved to the [[United States]] in [[September]] [[1968]],  with little money or knowledge of the English language, and trained at [[Gold's Gym]] in [[Santa Monica]] under the [[patronage]] of [[Joe Weider]]. 
He became a U.S. citizen in [[1983]], although he has also retained his Austrian citizenship. During this time, he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[University of Wisconsin-Superior]] where he graduated with degrees in [[marketing|international marketing]] of fitness and [[business administration]] in 1979.   

In 1983 his autobiography, ''Arnold: The Education of a Body-Builder'' was published. 

In 1986, Schwarzenegger married TV journalist [[Maria Shriver]], niece of the late [[President of the United States]] [[John F. Kennedy]]. The couple have four children: daughters Katherine (born [[December 13]], [[1989]]) and Christina (b.[[July 23]], [[1991]]), and sons Patrick (b.[[September 18]], [[1993]]) and Christopher (b.[[September 27]], [[1997]]). Together, the couple own a home in [[gated community|gated]] [[Bel Air, California]] as well as at the fabled [[Kennedy Compound]] in [[Massachusetts]].

His distinctive and oft-imitated accent has led many entertainers and pundits to refer to him simply as &quot;Ah-nuldt&quot;.

Though Schwarzenegger refuses to discuss his plastic surgery (&quot;You are confusing me with [[Cher (entertainer)|Cher]],&quot; he told ''[[People Magazine]]'' in 2002), citing before and after photos, critics allege he has undergone procedures on his eyes and chin, and has received at least one facelift (see [http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger/]).

==Bodybuilding career==
Schwarzenegger first gained fame as a [[bodybuilding|bodybuilder]]. One of the first competitions he won was Junior Mr. Europe. He would go on to compete in and win many bodybuilding (as well as some [[powerlifting]]) contests, including 4 [[NABBA Mr. Universe]] wins and a record 7 [[Mr. Olympia]] wins, a record which would remain until [[Lee Haney]] won his eighth straight Mr. Olympia title in 1991. In 1967 Arnold won the Munich stone lifting contest in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds, approximately 560 English pounds, is lifted between the legs while standing on two foot rests. Arnold broke the existing record, winning the contest. Arnold's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming Mr. Olympia. 

His first attempt was in 1969 where he lost to three-time champion [[Sergio Oliva]]. Arnold entered the contest confident, but when he saw Oliva in the pump room his confidence was shattered. The terrifying image of Oliva spurred Arnold to come back in 1970 with a vengence. He convincingly won the competition. Arnold won the 1971 Mr. Olympia with little incident. Then, in 1972, Oliva came back with what is still considered by many to be the greatest physique ever displayed. Arnold won the show but it was very close and bodybuilding fans still argue over whether Arnold or Sergio should have won. In 1973, Arnold once again won the Olympia with no real competition. He displayed his best physique to that point. Perhaps Arnold was in such great shape for the 1973 Olympia because he feared Oliva would once again enter the competition. In 1974, Arnold was once again in top form and won the title for the fifth consecutive time. Lou Ferrigno also competed at the '73 Olympia. Ferrigno was the first possible threat to Arnold's reign since Oliva. Arnold retired from competition after the 1974 Olympia. However, George Butler and Charles Gaines convinced him to compete one more time so they could make the bodybuilding documentary called ''[[Pumping Iron]]''. Arnold had only three months to prepare for the competition after losing significant weight to appear in the film ''Stay Hungry'' with Jeff Bridges. Ferrigno proved to not be a threat and a lighter than usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Olympia. After being declared Mr. Olympia for a sixth consecutive time Arnold once again retired from competition. Arnold came out of retirement to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia, the most controversial Olympia ever. [[Mike Mentzer]] was defeated in this competition, despite being on his best ever form (a fact which caused him to leave the world of bodybuilding). Arnold was a late entry and won with only eight weeks of preparation.  Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding, and his legacy is commemorated in the [[Arnold Classic]] annual bodybuilding competition.

Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent face in the bodybuilding sport long after his retirement, in part due to his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows. For many years he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines [[Muscle and Fitness|Muscle &amp; Fitness]] and ''Flex''. Shortly after being elected Governor, he was appointed executive [[editor]] of both magazines in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. The magazine ''MuscleMag International'' has a monthly two page article on him and refers to him as &quot;The King&quot;.

Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was to the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]], on which he served from 1990 to 1993. He was nominated by [[George H. W. Bush]], who called him Conan the Republican.

In 2003 two [[African-American]] bodybuilders came forward claiming that Schwarzenegger has a history of making [[racist]] comments. Schwarzenegger has allegedly said, &quot;If you gave these [[Black people|Blacks]] a country to run, they would run it down the tubes&quot; (see [http://www.drudgereport.com/ar1.htm]).

===Steroid Use===
Schwarzenegger has admitted to using performance-enhancing [[anabolic steroid]]s whilst they were legal, writing in 1977 that &quot;[steroids] were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when cutting up.&quot; However, some bodybuilders who used the same steroid cocktails as Schwarzenegger in the 1970s dispute the notion that they were used merely for &quot;muscle maintenance&quot;. Even Schwarzenegger has called the drugs &quot;tissue building.&quot; (see [http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm])

In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Dr. Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted an early death for the bodybuilder based on a link between steroid use and later heart problems. Because the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 20,000 ($12,000 USD) libel judgment against him in a German court. In 1999 Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with [[Globe Magazine]], a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health. As late as 1996, a year before open heart surgery to replace an [[aortic valve]], Schwarzenegger publicly defended his use of anabolic steroids during his bodybuilding career. (see [http://espn.go.com/columns/farrey_tom/1655597.html])

Schwarzenegger was born with a [[bicuspid aortic valve]]; a normal heart has [[tricuspid]] valves. According to a spokesman, Schwarzenegger has not used anabolic steroids since 1990 when they were made illegal (see [http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm]). In bodybuilder slang, steroids are sometimes refered to as &quot;Arnolds&quot; (see [http://www.streetdrugs.org/dgsa.htm]).

==Acting career==
===Roles===
Schwarzenegger had long planned to segue from bodybuilding into a career in acting, as had done many of his idols, such as [[Reg Park]]. Initially he had trouble breaking into films due to his long surname, large muscles, and foreign accent,  but was eventually chosen to play the role of Hercules (as had done both Reg Park and [[Steve Reeves]]) in ''[[Hercules in New York]]'' (1970). Credited under the name ''Arnold Strong'', his accent in the film was so thick that his lines had to be [[dubbed]] after production. His second film appearance was as a [[deaf]] and [[mute]] hitman for the mob in director [[Robert Altman|Robert Altman's]] ''[[The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' (1976), for which he was awarded a [[Golden Globe]] for Best New Male Star. Schwarzenegger came to the attention of more people in the documentary ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' (1977), elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, Schwarzenegger purchased the rights to this film, its outtakes, and associated still photography (see [http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/arnoldpump1.html]).

[[Image:Terminator.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[The Terminator]]'', starring Schwarzenegger (1984)]]

The 6'2&quot; Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was ''[[Conan the Barbarian (film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982), and this was cemented by a sequel, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' (1984). As an actor, he is best-known as the title character of director [[James Cameron]]'s android thriller ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984).  Schwarzenegger's acting ability (described by one critic as having an emotional range that &quot;stretches from A almost to B&quot;) has long been the butt of many jokes; he retains a strong Austrian accent in his speech even in roles which do not call for such an accent. However, few of the fans of his work seem to care. He also made a mark for injecting his films with a droll, often self-deprecating sense of humor, setting him apart from more serious action heroes such as [[Sylvester Stallone]], his most prominent contemporary. (As an aside, his alternative-universe comedy/thriller ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' featured a poster of the movie ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' which, in that alternate universe had Sylvester Stallone as its star; a similar in-joke in ''[[Twins (movie)|Twins]]'' suggested that the two actors might one day co-star, something which has yet to come to pass).

[[Image:predator.gif|thumb|180px|left|''[[Predator (movie)|Predator]]'', starring Schwarzenegger (1987)]]

Following his arrival as a Hollywood superstar, he made a number of commercially successful films: ''[[Commando (film)|Commando]]'' (1985), ''[[Raw Deal (1986 movie)|Raw Deal]]'' (1986), ''[[The Running Man]]'' (1987), and ''[[Red Heat]]'' (1988). In ''[[Predator (movie)|Predator]]'' (1987), another commercially successful film, Schwarzenegger led a cast which included future [[Minnesota]] [[List of Governors of Minnesota|Governor]] [[Jesse Ventura]] (Ventura also appears in ''Running Man'') and future [[Kentucky]] [[List of Governors of Kentucky|Gubernatorial]] Candidate [[Sonny Landham]]. ''[[Twins (movie)|Twins]]'', (1988) a comedy with [[Danny DeVito]], was a change of pace.  ''[[Total Recall (film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), at that time the most expensive film ever, netted Schwarzenegger $10 million and 15% of the gross, and was a widely praised, thought-provoking science-fiction script behind his usual violent action.  ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990) was another comedy. 

Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a [[1990]] episode of the [[TV series]] ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', entitled &quot;[[List of Tales from the Crypt episodes#Season 2 (1990)|The Switch]]&quot;, and then with the [[1992]] [[telemovie]] ''[[Christmas in Connecticut]]''. He has not directed since.

Schwarzenegger's critical and commercial high-water mark was ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991). His next film project, the self-aware action comedy ''[[Last Action Hero]],'' (1993), had the misfortune to be released opposite ''[[Jurassic Park]]'', and suffered accordingly.  Schwarzenegger's career never again achieved quite the same prominence, his aura of box-office invincibility suffering.  ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994) was a popular sendup of spy films, and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with director [[James Cameron]], whose own career had taken off with ''[[The Terminator]]''. Shortly thereafter came ''[[Junior (film)|Junior]]'', which brought Schwarzenegger his second [[Golden Globe]] nomination, this time for Best Actor - Musical or Comedy. It was followed by the popular, albeit by-the-numbers ''[[Eraser (movie)|Eraser]]'' (1996), and ''[[Batman and Robin (1997 movie)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' (1997), his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury.  Although ''[[Batman and Robin (1997 movie)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' was a famous disaster, Schwarzenegger emerged largely unscathed.  Several film projects were announced with Schwarzenegger attached to star including the remake of ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'', a new film of ''[[I Am Legend]]'' and a World War II film scripted by [[Quentin Tarantino]] that would have seen Schwarzenegger finally play an Austrian. Instead he returned with ''[[End of Days]]'' (1999) - an unsuccessful and atypically dark attempt to broaden his acting range - ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000) and ''[[Collateral Damage]]'' (2002), none of which came close to recapturing his former prominence. He starred in the popularly received ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' (2003)  His last film appearance to date was a cameo appearance in the 2004 remake of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 movie)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'', notable for featuring him onscreen with action star [[Jackie Chan]] for the first time.

==Political career==
[[Image:Arnoldandson.jpg|thumb|200px|Schwarzenegger and son Patrick at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]] in December 2002.]]

===Political affiliation===
Schwarzenegger is a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], unusual among the often heavily [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] community. He describes himself as fiscally conservative and socially moderate (i.e. he is [[pro-choice]] and supports [[stem cell]] research.) Schwarzenegger backed Republican President [[Ronald Reagan]] (another movie star turned politician) while Reagan was in office, and campaigned for [[George H.W. Bush]] in 1988. However, he chastised fellow Republicans during the impeachment of [[Bill Clinton]] in 1998. Sensing an opportunity to affect the outcome of the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential race]], Schwarzenegger campaigned in Ohio for Republican [[George W. Bush]] in the closing days of the campaign.

In an interview on [[October 29]], [[2002]], with [[MSNBC]]'s [[Chris Matthews]] at [[Chapman University]], Schwarzenegger explained why he is a Republican:

:&quot;Well, I think because a lot of people don't know why I'm a Republican, I came first of all from a socialistic country which is Austria and when I came over here in 1968 with the [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|presidential elections]] coming up in November, I came over in October, I heard a lot of the press conferences from both of the candidates [[Hubert Humphrey|Humphrey]] and [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], and Humphrey was talking about more government is the solution, protectionism, and everything he said about government involvement sounded to me more like [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Austrian socialism]].

:Then when I heard Nixon talk about it, he said open up the borders, the consumers should be represented there ultimately and strengthen the military and get the government off our backs. I said to myself, what is this guy's party affiliation? I didn't know anything at that point. So I asked my friend, what is Nixon? He's a Republican. And I said, I am a Republican. That's how I became a Republican.&quot;

Regarding a run for public office, in 1999, he told ''Talk'' magazine that &quot;I think about it many times.&quot; He also said, &quot;The possibility is there because I feel it inside. I feel there are a lot of people standing still and not doing enough. And there's a vacuum.&quot;

===Venturing into politics===
Schwarzenegger was appointed Chairman of the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]] in the administration of [[George H. W. Bush]] from 1990 to 1993.  During that time, Schwarzenegger traveled across the U.S. promoting physical fitness to kids and lobbying all 50 governors in support of school fitness programs.  &quot;He would hit sometimes two or three governors in a day in his own airplane, at his own expense, somewhere around $4,000 an hour,&quot; said George Otott, his chief of staff at the time. &quot;When he walked in, it wasn't about the governor, it was about Arnold,&quot; said Otott, a retired Marine. &quot;He has what we in the military call a ''command presence''. He becomes the number one attention-getter.&quot;

He later served as Chairman for the California ''Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports'' under Governor [[Pete Wilson]]. Schwarzenegger scored his first real political success on [[November 5]], [[2002]], when [[California]]ns approved his personally crafted and sponsored [[California Proposition 49 (2002)|Proposition 49]], the &quot;After School Education and Safety Program Act of 2002&quot;, an initiative to make state grants available for after-school programs.

===2003 California recall===
For years, Schwarzenegger had discussed with friends, potential donors, advisors and political allies a possible run for high political office; on [[April 10]], [[2003]], for example, he met with Republican political operative [[Karl Rove]] to discuss a future campaign. 

In the months leading to the [[2003 California recall]], Schwarzenegger was widely rumored to be considering a run at becoming [[Governor of California]]. In the July 2003 issue of ''[[Esquire Magazine]]'', he said, &quot;Yes, I would love to be governor of California ... If the state needs me, and if there's no one I think is better, then I will run.&quot;  When a petition to recall [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] governor [[Gray Davis]] qualified for the ballot on [[July 24]], Schwarzenegger left many wondering whether he would jump into the contest. Schwarzenegger was just wrapping up a promotional tour for ''Terminator 3'' and said he would announce his decision on whether to run on [[August 6]] on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.

[[Image:Arnold Schwarzenegger inauguration-crowd750.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Crowd watching Schwarzenegger inauguration]]

In the days and even hours leading up to the show's taping, political experts and insiders concluded that Schwarzenegger was leaning against running in California's [[October 7]] recall election. Even his closest advisors said he was probably not going to run. Rumors leading up to the announcement said that his wife, [[Maria Shriver]], a Kennedy family Democrat, was against his running, and he wanted her approval in order to run. When announcing his candidacy on [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|the Tonight Show]], he joked, &quot;It's the most difficult [decision] I've made in my entire life, except the one I made in 1978 when I decided to get a bikini wax&quot;. Ultimately, Shriver said she would support Schwarzenegger no matter what he chose, so he decided to run. Schwarzenegger told Leno, &quot;The politicians are fiddling, fumbling and failing. The man that is failing the people more than anyone is [[Gray Davis]]. He is failing them terribly, and this is why he needs to be recalled and this is why I am going to run for governor of the state of California.&quot;  

As a candidate in the recall election, Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy was immediate national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the &quot;Governator&quot; (referring to ''[[The Terminator]]'' movies, see above) and &quot;The Running Man&quot; (the name of another of his movies), and calling the recall election &quot;Total Recall&quot; (ditto) and &quot;Terminator 4: Rise of the Candidate&quot; (referring to his movie ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]''). Schwarzenegger was quick to make use of his well-known one-liners, promising to &quot;pump up [[Sacramento, California]]&quot; (the state capital) and tell [[Gray Davis]] ''hasta la vista''. At the end of his first press conference, he told the audience &quot;I'll be back.&quot;  Schwarzenegger looked to follow in the footsteps of former California governor and one-time movie star [[Ronald Reagan]].

However, due to his status as a [[naturalize]]d citizen, he would not be eligible to seek the [[President of the United States|Presidency]] unless the [[Constitution]] were to be amended (as proposed in 2000 by [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Barney Frank]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Massachusetts|MA]]), and in July 2003 (the [[Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment]]) by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Orrin Hatch]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Utah|UT]])). Among his campaign team were Democrat actor [[Rob Lowe]], Democrat sounding billionaire [[Warren Buffett]], and moderate [[George Shultz]] (former Nixon and Reagan aide).

[[Image:Arnold Schwarzenegger sexual harassment protestors750.jpg|thumb|300px|Sexual harassment protesters]]

During the campaign, allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger (see [[Gropegate]]). Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' recounting allegations of sexual misconduct from several individual women, sixteen of whom eventually came forward with their personal stories. Chronologically, they ranged from Elaine Stockton, who claimed that Schwarzenegger groped her breast at a [[Gold's Gym]] in 1975 (she was 19 at the time), to a 51 year old woman who said that he pinned her to his chest and spanked her shortly after she met him in connection with production of his film, ''[[The Sixth Day]]'', in 2000. Schwarzenegger admitted that he has &quot;behaved badly sometimes&quot; and apologized, but also stated that &quot;a lot of (what) you see in the stories is not true&quot;. This came after a magazine interview from the same era (1975) surfaced in which Schwarzenegger discussed attending sexual orgies and indulging in drugs like [[marijuana]] and [[cocaine]] (see
[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2003/10/03/state1434EDT0082.DTL]], [[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/arnoldinter1.html]], [[http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-women2oct02,1,4493659,print.story]). 

Allegations printed on the front page of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', based on selective quotation, which Schwarzenegger claimed not to recall, were also made that he at one time admired [[Adolf Hitler]] and had praised him as a great propagandist. However the full text of the statement from which the quotation was taken significantly reduces the credibility of the allegations. Although Schwarzenegger's father was in fact a member of the [[Nazi]] party, Schwarzenegger has been a strong supporter of various Jewish groups, and has denounced the principles of the fascist German regime, saying &quot;I have always despised everything that Hitler stands for&quot;.

March 1992 [[Spy Magazine]] article mentions a story confirmed by &quot;a businessman and longtime friend of Schwarzenegger's&quot; -- that in the '70s Arnold &quot;enjoyed playing and giving away records of Hitler's speeches&quot; (see [http://www.s-t.com/daily/12-96/12-25-96/c06ae100.htm]]). Schwarzenegger supported the campaign of his friend, [[Kurt Waldheim]], former [[UN]] chief and a former Austrian politician who was accused of [[war crimes]] during World War II in [[Yugoslavia]], which resulted in both Waldheim, and his wife, Elisabeth, both of whom belonged to the Nazi Party, being excluded from entering the [[United States]]. Schwarzenegger's name remained on Waldheim's campaign posters, even after allegations of Waldheim's war crimes were brought to light. Waldheim was also invited to Arnold's wedding with [[Maria Shriver]], but declined (see [[http://arnoldexposed.com/arnold.htm#nazi]).

These allegations were brought up mainly in the context of his campaign, but they continue to be occasionally used by some critics. [[Garry Trudeau]], the [[cartoonist]] behind the [[comic strip]] [[Doonesbury]], combined the allegations by nicknaming Schwarzenegger &quot;Herr Gröpenführer&quot; and depicting Schwarzenegger as a huge, groping hand in his artwork. 

A slightly smaller scandal arose when campaign ads were shown to have citizens of California out of focus, but products from campaign contributors clear. This got little press but still angered many.
On [[October 7]], [[2003]], the [[2003 California recall]] resulted in Governor [[Gray Davis]] being recalled with 55.4% of the ''Yes'' vote. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote, defeating Democrat [[Cruz Bustamante]], fellow Republican [[Tom McClintock]] and others. In total, Arnold won the election by about 1.3 million votes.

He was sworn into office on [[November 17]], [[2003]]. Schwarzenegger's inauguration was opened by [[Vanessa Lynn Williams]], his co-star from ''[[Eraser (movie)|Eraser]]'', singing the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]]. Hollywood attendees included [[Danny DeVito]], [[Rhea Perlman]], [[Dennis Miller]] and [[Rob Lowe]] (Only Miller is a Republican). The Schwarzenegger children joined others in reciting the [[Pledge of Allegiance]], then [[Maria Shriver]] spoke and held the Bible while Schwarzenegger was sworn into the office of Governor. He spoke briefly: &quot;Today is a new day in California. I did not seek this office to do things the way they've always been done. What I care about is restoring your confidence in your government... This election was not about replacing one man. It was not replacing one party. It was about changing the entire political climate of our state.&quot;

===Governorship===

[[Image:Arnold and Edmund 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Arnold Schwarzenegger and [[Bavaria]]'s minister president [[Edmund Stoiber]].]]

In his first few hours in office Schwarzenegger fulfilled his campaign promise to repeal an unpopular 200% increase in vehicle license fees undertaken to fund the state's budget. The increase was a restoration to 1998 levels. On his first full day in office, Schwarzenegger proposed a three-point plan to address the budget woes. First, Schwarzenegger proposed floating $15,000,000,000 (USD) in [[bond]]s. Second, he urged voters to pass a [[constitutional amendment]] to limit state spending. Third, he sought an overhaul of [[workers' compensation]]. Schwarzenegger also called the state legislature into a special session and said that spending cuts would also be necessary. He initiated the cuts by agreeing to serve as governor with no salary, a savings of $175,000 (USD) per year.  

To fulfill the first two points, he urged California voters to pass [[California Proposition 57 (2004)|Proposition 57]] and [[California Proposition 58 (2004)|Proposition 58]] in the [[March 2]], [[2004]], election, which authorized the sale of $15 billion in bonds and mandated balanced budgets, respectively. Despite initially tepid support from the public, the combination of heavy campaigning by Schwarzenegger, endorsements from a number of leading Democrats, and warnings about the dire consequences should the propositions fail to pass, led to overwhelming votes in favor of the two propositions. Prop. 57 passed with 63.3% of the votes in favor and Prop. 58 passed with 71.0% in favor. He accomplished the third point when he signed a workers' compensation reform bill on [[April 19]], [[2004]]. Schwarzenegger convinced the Democratic-controlled state legislature to approve the package by threatening to take the issue directly to state voters in a November ballot initiative if the legislature did not act.

Schwarzenegger was later criticized for reneging on his campaign pledges not to take money from special interests and for failing to answer directly the sexual harassment allegations raised by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' immediately preceding the recall election. However, Schwarzenegger made a point shortly after becoming governor of voluntarily attending a training course conducted by the state Attorney General's office on preventing sexual harassment (along with several members of his senior staff). Schwarzenegger continues to collect campaign contributions from private interests (see [http://arnoldwatch.org/special_interests/index.html]]) at a greater rate than any politician in California history, including Gray Davis, whom he criticized on that very issue (see [[http://www.nbc4.tv/politics/2385057/detail.html]).

In February 2004 when [[San Francisco]] city mayor, [[Gavin Newsom]], ordered a change in the certificate application documents to allow for [[same-sex marriage]]s, Governor Schwarzenegger opposed the move as being beyond the powers of the mayor, but also said that he supports gay rights and has expressed support for a law to grant [[civil unions]] to gay couples. 

In 2005 when he vetoed a bill that would have legalized same-sex marriages he defended his actions by saying that California voters had passed an initiative banning such recognition and that he supports that state's domestic partnership law that gives same-sex couples many of the same rights as a heterosexual married couple. 

Still, critics have observed that there is no federal requirement that other states recognize a state-granted domestic partnership, as is the case with marriages under the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]] of the United States Constitution. 

Also in February 2004, he declined [[amnesty]] to convicted murderer [[Kevin Cooper]] who had asked him for clemency in his [[death penalty]] sentence. Nevertheless, Cooper's planned [[Execution (legal)|execution]] was stayed by the [[Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] pending a revisiting of evidence. The first execution under his administration was that of [[Donald Beardslee]]. 

[[Austrian Green Party]] spokesman, [[Peter Pilz]], later called for Schwarzenegger to be stripped of his Austrian [[citizenship]]. Pilz claimed that Austrian law forbids any Austrian citizen from taking part in or ordering executions. However, Schwarzenegger does not appear to be in any danger of losing his Austrian citizenship.

The governor has granted [[clemency]] to a number of [[Felony|convicted felons]] &amp;ndash; more than Democrat predecessor Gray Davis, who presided over numerous executions. The power of clemency is often controversial. After a longer period of consideration than is usual, on [[December 12]], [[2005]], Schwarzenegger denied clemency to quadruple murderer [[Stanley Tookie Williams]], who was executed on [[December 13]]. In a statement (see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4523352.stm]) Schwarzenegger argued not on the grounds that Williams' actions were beyond atonement: instead he appeared to acknowledge that atonement was possible, but Williams had not done so, Schwarzenegger stating that &quot;the one thing [apologising for the four murders he committed] that would be the clearest indication of complete remorse and full redemption is the one thing Williams will not do.&quot;

Despite expectations that Schwarzenegger would be vulnerable to opposition critics once taking office, his early governorship showed some successes. He has dealt successfully with California politicians as diverse as [[John Burton]] on the left to [[Tom McClintock]] on the right. At the end of May, 2004, the Field poll put his popularity at 65%, the highest for a California governor in 45 years, including 41% of Democrats, party adherents of his opposition. By comparison, former [[United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], known as &quot;the Great Communicator,&amp;quot; never hit 60% approval while serving as California governor. (see [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/politics/cal/la-me-lopez28may28,1,2650515.column?coll=la-news-politics-california]) 

In March, 2004 libertarian policy research foundation, [[The Cato Institute]], rated him 1st in their 1994 fiscal policy report card (see [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3691]) of the tax and spending policies of the nation's governors.

In July 2004, however, Schwarzenegger and the state legislature deadlocked, failing to approve the state budget on time. Trying to rouse public support for his position, he compared lawmakers to kindergartners who need a &quot;timeout,&quot; and in a rally of supporters called his budget opponents &quot;girlie men&quot; (a reference to a long-running ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skit parodying Schwarzenegger). He said about the legislators: &quot;They are part of a bureaucracy that is out of shape, that is out of date, that is out of touch and that is definitely out of control in Sacramento. They cannot have the guts to come out there in front of you and say, 'I don't want to represent you. I want to represent those special interests: the unions, the trial lawyers.' ... if they don’t have the guts, I call them girlie-men. They should get back to the table and they should finish the budget.&quot; The remark became national news and was not received well by his opponents, including gay advocacy and feminist groups who labeled it homophobic and sexist, in spite of his earlier support for gay rights (see the Gavin Newsom incident above), not to mention the legislators themselves. Others however, were quick to point out that the critics actually were expressing a sentiment of latent [[homophobia]] themselves because they automatically connected the phrase &quot;girlie-men&quot; with [[homosexual]]s. His supporters made &quot;girly men&quot; T-shirts and the Governor continued to use the term, including when he addressed the [[Republican National Convention]] in NYC, calling critics of the current U.S. economic situation &quot;economic girlie men&quot;.

Despite what some viewed as political snags during the summer, the Field polls released in August and October 2004 showed that Schwarzenegger's approval rating remained at 65%. Additionally, in October, for the first time in four years a plurality of Californians felt the state was &quot;on the right track&quot;.  

However, when asked if they would support Schwarzenegger if he could run for president, 50% said they would oppose, while only 26% said they would support the governor in a presidential bid (see [http://field.com/fieldpollonline/subscribers/RLS2137.pdf]).

====Spring 2005====
&lt;!--Please remember to report neutrally in this section--&gt;
In the spring of 2005, polls began showing Schwarzenegger's approval ratings had dropped to between 40-49%.
(See [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-cap7apr07,1,63188.column?coll=la-headlines-california&amp;amp;ctrack=3&amp;cset=true],
[http://www.woai.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=A367E183-FC31-4616-8669-4FD5D36181D4],
[http://www.surveyusa.com/50governorsrated051005.htm], 
[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=ac98Wx3eNeSw&amp;refer=us].)

On [[June 13]], [[2005]], Schwarzenegger called a [[California special election, 2005|statewide special election]] for [[November 8]], [[2005]], to vote on a series of reform measures he initially proposed in his 2005 State of the State address. A non-partisan Field poll released a week later showed his support had dropped to 37%, one of the lowest approval ratings for any California governor and barely above the support of recalled former Governor, [[Gray Davis]] (see [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/06/21/state/n060039D76.DTL]).  

Schwarzenegger's spokesman responded that Schwarzenegger had not yet had enough time to explain his proposals to voters. The Legislature also shared low approval ratings, with just 24% of voters saying they approve of the job lawmakers have been doing. That represents a drop of 10% since February. The governor has responded that the poll sends a &quot;very clear message to us. They are saying they want us to work together.&quot; He has also responded &quot;I know popularity goes up and down... as soon as you start making decisions and strong decisions, sometimes they're not popular decisions.&quot; (see [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,159854,00.html], video, right side) 

Republicans have claimed that the drop in popularity was due to a multi-million dollar ad campaign by various groups such as unions for nurses, police and firefighters, who opposed his plans for the state pension and his administration's lawsuit to delay implementation of a nurse-to-patient staffing ratio plan. In late June 2005, another non-partisan Field Poll had similar numbers as the earlier one, finding that 57% of California voters are not inclined to elect Schwarzenegger to a second term as Governor in 2006 (see [http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20050629/pl_nm/politics_fieldpoll_dc_3]], [[http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/afp/20050621/ts_alt_afp/uspolitics_050621195840]).  

When asked about the lessons of the poll, Schwarzenegger has responded &quot;People make mistakes sometimes, and I think that we learn. [...] These are very clear messages that we must work together, and so I am looking forward to that.&quot;

To some degree, Governor Schwarzenegger's unpopularity has had to do with his confrontations with three popular labor groups: nurses, teachers, and firefighters. Some unions and activists reacted with anger (see [http://www.sfist.com/archives/2005/04/05/fk_arnold_nurses_firefighters_and_teachers_protest_the_governator.php],
[http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/politics/12112103.htm],
[http://cbs5.com/topstories/local_story_192212252.html],
[http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/states/california/northern_california/11964407.htm]), and others with humor (see [http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7445648/site/newsweek/],
[http://arnoldwatch.org/assets/governator_rap.mp3],
[http://talent.pratt.edu/user/114/114_-711700702-main.jpg]).

====Summer 2005====
=====Accusation of conflict of interest=====
While governor, Schwarzenegger continued to hold a position of executive editor of two [[American Media]] magazines. He announced in March 2004 that his $250,000 a year salary would be donated to charity. Schwarzenegger has an extensive history with the magazines and was frequently their star in his body-building days. As executive editor, he produces monthly columns based on his body-building history.

Schwarzenegger drew fire when a second contract, a consulting position, was subsequently discovered in [[SEC filing]]s, by the ''L.A. Times''. This second contract would net him an estimated $8,000,000 (USD) over the next five years (see [http://www.latimes.com/features/health/nutrition/la-me-bill15jul15,1,6217015.story?coll=la-health-nutrition-news]).  His consulting duties are not clear, except that the job allegedly &quot;takes up little time.&quot;  

''[[The New York Times]]'' further reported (on July 15) that under the five-year November 2003 contract, signed two days before his inauguration as Governor, '''Oak Productions''', Mr. Schwarzenegger's company, is to receive 1 % of the net print advertising revenues of '''Weider Publications'''. But the payment must be at least $1,000,000 (USD) per year. Mr. Schwarzenegger has also been granted '''phantom equity''', a way of sharing in the growth of the value of the company. The equity could become worth  1% of the company's value, which was stated at the time of the contract as $520,000,000 (USD)&quot; (see [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/15/national/15calif.html?ex=1279080000&amp;en=d59de5489ea19d3b&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss]).

This contract was seen as a conflict of interest by critics, who note that the magazines receive much of their revenue from advertisements for dietary supplements, a government-regulated industry affected by Schwarzenegger's veto (September 2004) of a bill that would ban schools from accepting sponsorships from firms that make performance-enhancing dietary supplements. In Schwarzenegger's reason for his veto, he drew a distinction between performance-enhancing dietary supplements and steroid usage, which he says is what needs to be prevented in high school students. (see [http://www.townhall.com/news/politics/200507/POL20050718a.shtml]).

Supporters point out that he did sign into law a bill that prohibited companies from selling the supplements to minors. Following the accusation, Schwarzenegger responded he would end the contracts with the magazines.

In August 2005, the [[Washington Post]] reported that American Media had paid former TV actress [[Gigi Goyette]], $20,000 (USD) to keep silent about a seven-year extramarital affair Schwarzenegger had with her beginning in 1975, when Goyette was 16 years old (see [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/12/AR2005081201651_pf.html]]). Since the [[age of consent]] in California is 18 years, Schwarzenegger may have committed [[statutory rape]]. In addition, American Media's knowledge of the Goyette affair put it in a position of being able to [[blackmail]] Schwarzenegger, providing further reason for Schwarzenegger to align his interests with theirs.

Also in August, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that five non-profit organizations had collected $3,000,000 (USD), chiefly from large businesses, in order to help defray Schwarzenegger's personal and political expenses, including the rent on the $6,000-a-month hotel suite that Schwarzenegger uses when in Sacramento (see [http://ktla.trb.com/news/local/la-me-nonprofits24aug24,0,3132004.story?coll=ktla-news-1]]). The governor's spokesman subsequently reported that Schwarzenegger had directed the disclosure of the contributors to the &quot;residence fund&quot; (see [[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-ed-funds29aug29,0,213871.story?coll=la-home-oped]).

====Fall 2005====
On [[September 29]], [[2005]], Schwarzenegger vetoed the California gay marriage bill after it had passed both houses of the legislature (see [http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=46212], [http://www.southernvoice.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=2680]). He stated that he vetoed the bill because he felt that it was in opposition to the will of the voters as expressed by [[Proposition 22]], that had passed in 2000 with 61.4% of the vote. Proposition 22 stated that only marriages between a man and a woman would be recognized in the state of California.

On [[September 16]], [[2005]], Schwarzenegger announced that he would seek a second term as governor. Despite his initially high approval ratings, a Field Poll conducted the week before indicated that only 36% of California voters were inclined to reelect him.

Schwarzenegger vetoed SB 469 (Bowen) October 7. It would have required people circulating petitions to say whether the signature gatherers are volunteers or are being paid to collect signatures.

Running up to the November special election, Schwarzenegger campaigned heavily throughout the state for his slate of propositions. Through an organization called &quot;Join Arnold&quot;, tens of millions of dollars were funneled into the state, mostly from corporate interests, to fund the campaign.  Schwarzenegger even reportedly spent 7 million dollars of his own money.  Schwarzenegger characterized the four propositions as being key to his reform agenda.  State unions and other groups opposed to the measures spent large sums of money opposing Schwarzenegger. Total spending by both sides leading up to the election was estimated at $300 million. 

Schwarzenegger made personal appearances at numerous so-called &quot;town hall meeting&quot; events throughout the state to promote the measures.   In reality these events were highly choreographed, and typically featured Hollywood-style set lighting and coordinated electronic displays. A group of four or so &quot;ordinary citizens&quot;, pre-selected by local Republican operatives, would appear on stage with Schwarzenegger to ask him questions at the appropriate time. The time and location of these events would not be released to the public until two hours in advance, to limit the time anti-Schwarzenegger forces had to organize protests.  

In the [[November 8]], [[2005]] special election, California voters dealt a devastating blow to Schwarzenegger by soundly rejecting all four ballot initiatives that Schwarzenegger had proposed to reform the state government. All propositions were defeated by a margin of at least 7 percentage points. The two propositions most key to Schwarzenegger's agenda, propositions 76 and 77, were defeated by 24 and 19 points respectively.

The defeat left Schwarzenegger significantly weakened politically, depriving him of the one source of leverage he had against the Democratic legislature. Some opponents took to calling him &quot;the One-terminator&quot;, a play on his popular role as &quot;the Terminator&quot; in films, implying that his chances of winning re-election had been diminished.

In the aftermath of the election, Schwarzenegger has moved back to the center. He has hired a former aide of [[Gray Davis]] as his chief of staff, and is working with California State Senate Majority Leader, [[Don Perata]], for development of a bond, estimated in the billions of dollars, to accelerate construction of [[infrastructure]] such as freeways and waterworks.

===Electoral History===
*'''2003 Recall Election for Governor'''
**Arnold Schwarzenegger (R), 49%
**[[Cruz Bustamante]] (D), 32%
**[[Tom McClintock]] (R), 13%

==Miscellaneous==
*On [[January 8]], [[2006]], while riding his [[Harley Davidson]] [[motorcycle]], with his son in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, the govenor sustained a minor injury to his lip, forcing him to get 15 [[sutures]]. &quot;No citations were issued&quot; said officer Jason Lee, a police spokesman. Schwarzenegger, who famously rode motorcycles in the [[Terminator]] movies, has never actually obtained an M-1 or M-2 endorsement on his [[California]] [[driver's license]] that would allow him to legally ride one on the street. In December 2001, he broke six ribs and was hospitalized for four days after another motorcycle crash in L.A.

* In honor of its most famous son, Schwarzenegger's home town of [[Graz]] had named its [[soccer]] stadium after him. The Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium, now officially titled [[Stadion Graz-Liebenau]], is the home of both [[Grazer AK]] and [[Sturm Graz]]. Following the [[Stanley Tookie Williams]] execution and after street protests in his home town, several local politicians began a campaign to remove Schwarzenegger's name from the stadium. Schwarzenegger responded, saying that &quot;to spare the responsible politicians of the city of Graz further concern, I withdraw from them as of this day the right to use my name in association with the Liebenauer Stadium&quot;. Graz officials removed Schwarzenegger's name from the stadium in December 2005 (see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4560182.stm]).

* In a satirical tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a 25-metre (82 foot) tall ''Terminator'' statue in a park in central Graz. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the [[Special Olympics]] (see [http://www.killoggs.com/news/?news=609]).

* In 2005 [[Peter Pilz]] from the [[Austrian Green Party]] in parliament demanded to revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship. This demand was based on article 33 of the Austrian citizenship act that states: '''A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship, if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic''' (see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4198633.stm]). Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]) had indeed done heavy damage to Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger justified his actions by referring to the fact that his only duty as Governor of California was to prevent an error in the judicial system. &quot;Schwarzenegger has a lot of muscles, but apparently not much heart,&quot; said Julien Dray, spokesman for the Socialist Party in France, where the death penalty was abolished in 1981.

* Schwarzenegger as president of the U.S. was jokingly referenced in the 1993 [[Sylvester Stallone]] film, ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]],'' where a future America passed a constitutional amendment to allow [[naturalization| naturalized]] Americans like Schwarzenegger to become [[President of the United States]], and that film has reference to a &quot;Schwarzenegger Presidential Library&quot;.

* Because Schwarzenegger opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue, medical experts predict he will require repeated heart valve replacement surgery in the next two to eight years (as his current valve degrades). Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.

* He bought the first [[Hummer]] manufactured for [[civilian]] use in 1992, a model so large, 6,300 lb (2900 kg) and 7 feet (2.1 m) wide that it is classified as a large truck and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to it. During the Gubernatorial Recall campaign he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen (see [http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3180817/]). The conversion was reported to have cost about $21,000 (USD). After the election, he signed an executive order to jumpstart the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the &quot;California Hydrogen Highway Network&quot;, and gained a [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] grant to help pay for its projected $91,000,000 (USD) cost (see [http://www.bmwworld.com/hydrogen/schwarzenegger.htm]). California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004 (see [http://trucks.about.com/od/hybridcar/a/hummer_h2h.htm]).

* His fellow bodybuilder and actor, [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]], has collaborated with him in 15 movies so far.

* He has appeared alongside his fellow actor from [[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]], [[Jackie Chan]], in a government advert to combat piracy, (see [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6443035544827856436&amp;q=Jackie+Chan&amp;pr=goog-sl]).

* Schwarzenegger's official height has usually been reported as 6'2&quot;, though some observers debit him two or three inches. While campaigning for [[George W. Bush]] in Ohio in 2004, he appeared only about an inch taller than the 5'11&quot; President. Schwarzenegger's weight while competing was in the 245 pound range; currently, he carries about 210 pounds.

* In 1983 Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video &quot;Carnival in Rio&quot;, which ''could'' be seen as advertising [[sex tourism]] in [[Brazil]] (see [http://www.devilducky.com/media/38195/]).

==Net worth==
According to ([http://www.arnoldexposed.com/]), Schwarzenegger's net worth has been estimated  conservatively at $100,000,000 (USD), and over the years, he invested his bodybuilding and movie earnings in an array of stocks, bonds, privately controlled companies and real estate holdings in the US and worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Actium''' (mod. Punta), the ancient name of a [[promontory]] in the north of [[Acarnania]] ([[Greece]]) at the mouth of the Sinus Ambracius ([[Gulf of Arta]]) opposite [[Nicopolis]], built by [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] on the north side of the strait. On the promontory was an ancient temple of [[Apollo]] Actius, which was enlarged by Augustus, who also, in memory of the [[battle]],
instituted or renewed the quinquennial games called Actia or Ludi Actiaci. Actiaca Aera was a computation of time from the [[Battle of Actium]]. There was on the promontory a small [[town]], or rather [[village]], also called Actium.

== History ==

Actium belonged originally to the [[Corinth|Corinthian]] [[colonist]]s of Anactorium, who probably founded the [[worship]] of Apollo Actius and the Actia games; in the [[3rd century BC|3rd century B.C.]] it fell to the [[Acarnania|Acarnanians]], who subsequently held their synods there. Actium is chiefly famous as the site of [[Caesar Augustus]]' decisive [[battle of Actium|victory]] over [[Mark Antony]] ([[September 2]] [[31 BC|31 B.C.]]). This battle ended a long series of ineffectual operations. The final conflict was provoked by Antony, who is said to have been persuaded by [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra VII]] to retire to [[Egypt]] and give battle to mask his retreat; but lack of provisions and the growing demoralization of his [[army]] would eventually account for this decision.

'''Amway''' is a [[multi-level marketing]] company founded in [[1959]] by [[Jay Van Andel]] and [[Rich DeVos]]. The company's name is a [[portmanteau]] of &quot;American Way.&quot; [http://www.amway.com/en/History/history-10362.aspx] Based in [[Ada, Michigan]], the company &amp; family of companies under [[Alticor]] reported sales of $6.4 billion for the performance year ending August 31, 2005 marking the company’s sixth straight year of growth. Its product lines include personal care products, jewelry, dietary supplements, and [[cosmetics]], among others. Today, Amway conducts business through a number of affiliated companies in more than ninety countries and territories around the world [http://www.amway.com/en/History/global-growth-10106.aspx]. 

In [[1999]] the founders of the Amway corporation launched a sister (and separate) [[Internet]]-based company named [[Quixtar]]. The [[Alticor]] corporation owns both Amway and Quixtar, plus several other concerns. Quixtar replaced the North American business of Amway in [[2001]], with Amway operating in the rest of the world. [[Amivo]] acts as an Amway subsidiary in [[Europe]], as does [[a2k]] in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

Amway cofounder Jay Van Andel (in 1980) and later his son Steve Van Andel (in 2001) were elected by the board of directors of the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] as chairman of that organization.

==The Corporation==

Anyone can become an Amway [[Independent Business Owner]] (or ''IBO'', formerly known as a ''Distributor''); IBOs may purchase products from Amway at rates published as [[wholesale]] prices.			

Each product has an associated Points Value (PV), which is the same for that product all around the world. It operates like an international [[currency]], which represents the amount of [[profit]] inherent in the product. The sum of the group's PV determines the commission level (3%, 6%, ... 25%) payable. The Business Volume (BV) turns the PV into the local currency, after removing items such as [[value added tax]] (which obviously cannot be part of the profit). The [[commission]] level is applied to the BV in determining the monthly payments to be received as commission.

As in most MLM businesses, a person wishing to join Amway is &quot;sponsored&quot; by an existing IBO. This involves the new IBO purchasing an &quot;Amway Opportunity Kit&quot; or &quot;Business Pack&quot; and completing the appropriate forms. The kit also contains literature and some starter product. IBOs must pay a yearly fee to remain in Amway, although they are not required to buy a minimum amount of products.

Amway claims to have 4 million distributors worldwide who have renewed at least once, including 500,000 in the U.S. [[Japan]] represents a very fast-growing market with 1 million distributors. Recently, Amway received permission to establish a network in [[China]] and have done sales of over 2 Billion U.S. dollars in 2004. (It should be noted that Amway cannot conduct Chinese operations as it typically does elsewhere due to a ban on direct sales).	

Training organizations exist to offer a variety of business services to IBOs as well as their prospective business partners. This includes training [[seminar]]s, CDs and literature. Often, public meetings are made available as a way of helping present the concept to prospects.

Amway's distributors are organized hierarchically, and the corporation employs a system of ''pin levels'' to reward successful distributors (so-called because attainees are awarded a stick pin to indicate their level.) Higher-level distributors act as mentors to newer distributors, organize regular meetings of their group and (controversially) may derive most of their profit from the sale of motivational tools to them. &quot;Crosslining,&quot; or associating with people from a different &quot;leg&quot; or distributor chain, is generally discouraged. 

===Pin Levels===

Pin levels reflect the level an IBO has reached in the Amway business. As such they are an indication of both the size of an IBO's group and their income, and by extension the IBO's knowledge and expertise in the field. Top pin level IBOs may have groups numbering hundreds or thousands of people, and are in high demand. They also command respect and adulation from their group. High pin levels are named after precious metals or gems to convey a sense of the wealth that they are supposed to represent.

The lowest pin levels reflect successively higher volumes of PV sold through the IBO's group, and are named after the percentage bonus that each level pays.

The first significant pin level is that of ''Platinum'' (formerly known as a ''Direct''.) The term Direct came from distributors beginning to get products sent to them directly from the corporation after attaining this level, as opposed to previously having bought them via their &quot;sponsoring&quot; distributor. (These days the &quot;Direct&quot; concept is defunct, as all IBOs order their product direct from Amway.) This level requires the IBO's group to be moving 7,500 PV (or 10,000 PV in some countries) of product per month, and the Amway recruitment plan customarily shows that such a group will have a total of 70-100 people; although in practice that number is often larger. The income at the Platinum level, generally speaking, is approximately the same as the average full-time wage in the IBO's country of origin, although this will depend on a number of factors including business structure, volume of retail sales versus group sales, and the total PV turnover. Variations typically range from half to over double the average full-time wage.

A significant pin level is that of ''Diamond''. This level requires that six people the IBO has sponsored have themselves reached the Platinum level (or higher). The remuneration at Diamond is (generally) a &quot;six-figure&quot; passive annual income, and advertised to represent financial freedom for the IBO. Almost all IBOs aspire to this pin level because of this &quot;freedom&quot; aspect.

(Note that it cannot merely be assumed that the income of a Diamond IBO is a simple 6x multiple of the income of a Platinum, since there are several other ranks between Direct and Diamond, and monetary bonuses are paid as a result of having attained these as well.)

The highest level is ''Crown Ambassador''. This level used to require at least twenty legs, each at least at the Platinum level. Amway has recently introduced a system called FAA Points, where it is possible to become a Crown Ambassador with only 9 legs - however each needs to have a Diamond within that leg. This is helping to create much more stable sustainable businesses.

Only a small number of people in the world have attained this pin level, and they are in constant demand for recruitment, training and motivational speaking engagements. The remuneration at the Crown Ambassador level runs into the millions annually.

Other pin levels include ''Ruby'' (15,000 PV per month), ''Emerald'' (three Platinum legs), and ''Executive-'', ''Double-'' and ''Triple Diamond'' (nine and twelve and 15 Platinum legs respectively - or with differing numbers of FAA Points.)

On top of the remuneration for PV moved through their group, an IBO may be entitled to additional monetary incentives. These bonuses are paid for meeting growth targets, extraordinary recruitment number, etc and can represent a significant portion of an IBO's income.

Alticor recently started a program that makes it possible to attain the Crown Ambassador level with only 9 legs. If all of the 9 legs are Diamonds, the IBO receives 27 FAA points as every Diamond counts for 3 FAA points. This allows for greater earnings than with the &quot;old-fashioned way.&quot; Additionally, approximately 80 FAA-points would guarantee a 7 figure bonus (USD) per year.

===&quot;Crown Ambassador&quot;===

By way of their seniority most Crown Ambassadors sit on various Amway [[board of directors|boards]], deciding business policy which affect all IBOs worldwide. Most also run, or contribute heavily to, their own motivational organizations. 
	
[[Dexter Yager]], one of the biggest landowners in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], considered a legend by some within the Amway organization, is probably the most famous American Crown Ambassador. He created a training system of functions, [[book]]s of the month, and [[tape]]s. This has been done by a number of other organizations, such as Network 21 which is the most international of the business systems which run parallel to Amway.

===Lines of Sponsorship===

A line of sponsorship (LOS or [[line of affiliation]]) is an essential organizational concept in Amway organizations. Status is determined by where one is on the hierarchical continuum within the LOS. Those [[upline]] have higher status and those and [[downline]] have less status. [http://www.mlmsurvivor.com/stewart_v_gooch4.htm] A given IBO signs an agreement upon registration that says he/she will not switch LOS ([[Crossline]]). [http://www.quixtar.com/Documents/IWOV/VIS/010-EN/PDFs_Redstar90104/IBO_Support/Registration/LA1037H_Registration.pdf]  Some of Amway LOS have included: [[TEAM (company)|TEAM]] (formerly Team of Destiny), [[InterNET]], [[BWW]], [[WorldWide Dream Builders]] (WWDB), [[Alliance Net Solutions]] (ANS), [[Empire]], [[True North]], [[eFinity]], [[InterNet Associates]] (INA), [[International Connection]], [[International Leadership Development]] (ILD), [[MarkerMan Productions]] (MMP), [[ProAlliance]], [[Interbiz]], [[IBO Alliance]], and [[GlobalNet]].[http://whataboutquixtar.com/forum/index.php?sid=7a767a537c21a12c6a3d4db1dbb75114]

==Controversy==

Amway (and its online incarnation, [[Quixtar]]) have been controversial for years because of allegations that these companies are [[pyramid scheme]]s. Critics claim that most of the products sold by Amway are to the Independent Business Owners (IBOs) themselves for personal consumption rather than to retail consumers who aren't enrolled as IBOs. Buying products from Amway or Quixtar gives IBOs points and they are paid back on the number of points that they generate from personal consumption. It is claimed to be a business opportunity and hence an existing IBO can help others to get an IBO number and divert their buying habit from other stores to Amway or Quixtar. Thus the business grows as a greater number of people join the group. The share of profit is based on the leverage that an IBO has.

Typically, IBOs spend a large amount of money on tapes, books, and seminars (known as &quot;tools&quot; in AMO parlance) which are ostensibly &quot;required&quot; to &quot;hone the business skills of the IBOs&quot;.  These are not provided by Amway itself but organizations often described as [[Amway Motivational Organization]]s (AMO) in general run by people in the higher ranks of the organization. Claims regarding the support material range from &quot;can be of help to an IBO &quot; to &quot;are absolutely required&quot; to &quot;build a big business&quot;. However, undercover investigations like one done by [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4375477/ MSNBC Dateline] in [[April 2003]] suggest that most of the money being earned by these successful individuals was coming from the hidden &quot;tools&quot; business rather than through selling the company products.  Critics also claim that the materials are specifically geared towards encouraging IBOs to continue working for a non-economic return, rather than improving their actual business skills.

[[Dexter Yager]]'s organization, the International Dreambuilders' Association/Digital Alliance (usually simply referred to by the abbreviation IDA) is arguably the largest and best-known of the AMOs, and is probably the one most commonly associated with Amway.

==Political causes/Culture==

Commentators have often (but not strictly accurately) identified Amway as supporting the [[United States Republican Party|US Republican Party]] and other [[right-wing]] causes. Amway Corporation claims to support no political party, yet 100% of its political donations have been to Republicans. [[Rich DeVos]] and [[Jay Van Andel]], who fully owned the company until their retirement (when they delegated authority and substantial ownership to their children), have strongly supported the Republican Party and socially and economically [[conservative]] causes, but that has been with their personal assets, not as a company position ''per se''. Many of Amway's best-known distributors, including Dexter Yager, have also declared themselves Republicans. Amway touts the [[environmental]] benefits of many of its products, and in June [[1989]] the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]]'s Regional Office for North America recognized it for its contributions to the cause of the environment.

As well as tending towards being right wing, the senior distributors also promote a worldview encompassing [[Pentecostal]] [[Christian fundamentalism]], and a general advocacy of [[Baby boomer|boomer]]/[[1950s|50s]] values. The Amway Motivational Organization's (AMO's) perception of the role of women, though, always includes successful women in awards, recognition and speaking engagements. One rarely, if ever, sees a male, married distributor speak on stage without his wife getting equal billing, and explaining her active role in the business. This is a reflection of the AMOs' strong advocacy of the [[1950s]] style [[nuclear family]] model. (Women have successfully developed Amway/Quixtar businesses around the world.)

A significant part of the Amway culture is the promotion and sale of training materials, as well as the attendance at meetings and rallies locally, regionally, and nationally. Training includes education about the topic of generalised, non-Amway specific [[entrepreneurship]]. The purpose of this is to create interest and enthusiasm. They are intended to maintain and increase membership, and to inspire IBOs to be more successful in their businesses. To a casual observer, they have some resemblance to a religious gathering. By involving people in a regular schedule of meetings, people are encouraged to maintain their focus, and to not be distracted by critics and other nay-sayers.

[[Doug Wead]], who was a Special Assistant to former U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]], is a successful IBO who is a regular speaker at group rallies.

In May of 2005, former Amway President Dick DeVos, one of the wealthiest people in Michigan, and his wife Betsy were listed as two of the largest campaign contributors of the 2004 election. Just days later, Dick announced that he would run against Governor [[Jennifer Granholm]] in [[2006]].

==Supporters==

[[Robert Kiyosaki]], author of the best-selling (but controversial) business books ''[[Rich Dad, Poor Dad]]'' and ''[[Cashflow Quadrant]]'', endorses organizations that, according to him, promote financial literacy. A few of those organizations utilize Amway as a vehicle to develop a business.

==Legal rulings==

In the [[1979]] ''In re. Amway Corp.'' (93 F.T.C. 618) ruling [http://www.ftc.gov/speeches/other/dvimf16.htm#N_19_], the [[Federal Trade Commission]] found that Amway does not qualify as an illegal pyramid scheme since the main aim of the enterprise is the sale of product. It did, however, order Amway to change several business practices and prohibited the company from misrepresenting the amount of profit, earnings or sales its distributors are likely to achieve. Amway was ordered to accompany any such statements with the actual averages per distributor, pointing out that more than half of the distributors do not make any money, with the average distributor making less than $100 per month. The order was violated with a [[1986]] ad campaign, resulting in a $100,000 fine. [http://www.ftc.gov/opa/predawn/F86/amway.htm]
	
In [[1983]], Amway pleaded guilty to [[tax evasion]] and [[Customs (tax)|customs]] [[fraud]] in Canada, resulting in a fine of CDN$25 million, the largest fine ever imposed in that country.
==Other violations==
In 2005, Amway/Quixtar orchestrated an attempt to drown out sites reporting deceptive practices and negative opinions. The [http://www.webraw.com/quixtar/archives/2004/10/the_quixtar_web_initiative.php &quot;Web Initiative&quot;] was flagged as [[Google bombing]], a violation of [http://www.google.com/webmasters/guidelines.html Google's Quality Guidelines].

'''Adam Smith, [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]''' (baptised [[June 5]], [[1723]] – [[July 17]], [[1790]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[political economy|political economist]] and [[moral philosophy|moral philosopher]].  His ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' was one of the earliest attempts to study the historical development of industry and commerce in [[Europe]].  That work helped to create the modern academic discipline of [[economics]] and provided one of the best-known intellectual rationales for [[free trade]] and [[capitalism]].

==Biography==
Smith was a son of the controller of the customs at [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Fife]], [[Scotland]]. The exact date of his birth is unknown, but he was baptized at Kirkcaldy on [[June 5]], [[1723]], his father having died some six months previously.  At around the age of 4, he was kidnapped by a band of [[Roma people|Gypsies]], but he was quickly rescued by his uncle and returned to his mother.  Smith's biographer, [[John Rae (biographer)|John Rae]], commented wryly that he feared Smith would have made &quot;a poor Gypsy.&quot;

At the age of fourteen, Smith proceeded to the [[University of Glasgow]], studying moral philosophy under &quot;the never-to-be-forgotten&quot; (as Smith called him) [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].  Here Smith developed his strong passion for liberty, reason and free speech.  In [[1740]] he entered [[Balliol College, Oxford]], but as William Robert Scott has said, &quot;the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] of his time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework,&quot; and he left the university in [[1746]]. In [[1748]] he began delivering public lectures in [[Edinburgh]] under the patronage of [[Lord Kames]]. Some of these dealt with rhetoric and ''belles-lettres'', but later he took up the subject of &quot;the progress of opulence,&quot; and it was then, in his middle or late 20s, that he first expounded the economic philosophy of &quot;the obvious and simple system of natural liberty&quot; which he was later to proclaim to the world in his ''Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations''. About [[1750]] he met [[David Hume]], who became one of the closest of his many friends.

In [[1751]] Smith was appointed professor on [[logic]] at the University of Glasgow, transferring in [[1752]] to the chair of [[moral philosophy]]. His lectures covered the fields of [[ethics]], [[rhetoric]], [[jurisprudence]], [[political economy]], and &quot;police and revenue.&quot; In [[1759]] he published his ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'', embodying some of his [[Glasgow]] lectures. This work, which established Smith's reputation in his day, was concerned with how human communication depends on sympathy between agent and spectator (that is, the individual and other members of society). His analysis of language evolution was somewhat superficial, as shown only 14 years later by a more rigourous examination of primitive language evolution by [[Lord Monboddo]] in his ''Of the Origin and Progress of Language''{{ref|monboddo}}. Smith's capacity for fluent, persuasive, if rather rhetorical argument is much in evidence. He bases his explanation, not as the third Lord Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had done, on a special &quot;moral sense&quot;, nor (as Hume did) on [[utilitarianism|utility]], but on sympathy.

Smith now began to give more attention to jurisprudence and economics in his lecture and less to his theories of morals. An impression can be obtained as to the development of his ideas on political economy from the notes of his lectures taken down by a student in about [[1763]] which were later edited by [[Edwin Cannan]]{{ref|cannan}}, and from what Scott, its discoverer and publisher, describes as &quot;An Early Draft of Part of The Wealth of Nations&quot;, which he dates about 1763.   Cannan's work appeared as ''Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue and Arms''.  A fuller version was published as [[Lectures on Jurisprudence]] in the Glasgow Edition of 1976.

At the end of 1763 Smith obtained a lucrative post as tutor to the young [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Duke of Buccleuch]] and resigned his professorship. From [[1764]]-[[1766|66]] he traveled with his pupil, mostly in France, where he came to know such intellectual leaders as [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert| Jean D'Alembert]], [[André Morellet]], [[Helvétius]] and, in particular, [[Francois Quesnay]], the head of the [[physiocrats|Physiocratic school]] whose work he respected greatly. On returning home to Kirkcaldy he devoted much of the next ten years to his [[magnum opus]], ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,'' which appeared in [[1776]]. It was very well-received and popular, and Smith became famous. In [[1778]] he was appointed to a comfortable post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother in Edinburgh. He died there on July 17, 1790, after a painful illness and was buried in Canongate Churchyard, Royal Mile, Edinburgh. He had apparently devoted a considerable part of his income to numerous secret acts of charity.

Smith's literary executors were two old friends from the Scottish academic world; physicist/chemist [[Joseph Black]] and pioneering geologist [[James Hutton]].  Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication.  He mentioned an early unpublished ''History of Astronomy'' as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material, as [[Essays on Philosophical Subjects]].

==Works==
Shortly before his death Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'' ([[1795]]) probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise.

''The Wealth of Nations'' was influential since it did so much to create the field of economics and develop it into an autonomous systematic discipline. In the Western world, it is arguably the most influential book on the subject ever published. When the book, which has become a classic [[manifesto]] against [[mercantilism]] (the theory that large reserves of [[bullion]] are essential for economic success), appeared in [[1776]], there was a strong sentiment for [[free trade]] in both [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and [[United States|America]]. This new feeling had been born out of the economic hardships and poverty caused by the war. However, at the time of publication, not everybody was immediately convinced of the advantages of [[free trade]]: the British public and [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] still clung to mercantilism for many years to come.

''The Wealth of Nations'' also rejects the [[Physiocrats|Physiocratic]] school's emphasis on the importance of land; instead, Smith believed labour was paramount, and that a [[division of labour]] would effect a great increase in production. ''Nations'' was so successful, in fact, that it led to the abandonment of earlier economic schools, and later economists, such as [[Thomas Malthus]] and [[David Ricardo]], focused on refining Smith's theory into what is now known as [[classical economics]] ([[Modern economics]] evolved from this). Malthus expanded Smith's ruminations on [[overpopulation]], while Ricardo believed in the &quot;[[iron law of wages]]&quot; — that overpopulation would prevent wages from topping the subsistence level. Smith postulated an increase of wages with an increase in production, a view considered more accurate today.

One of the main points of ''The Wealth of Nations'' is that the free market, while appearing chaotic and unrestrained, is actually guided to produce the right amount and variety of goods by a so-called &quot;[[Invisible Hand|invisible hand]]&quot;. If a product shortage occurs, for instance, its price rises, creating a profit margin that creates an incentive for others to enter production, eventually curing the shortage. If too many producers enter the market, the increased [[competition]] among manufacturers and increased supply would lower the price of the product to its production cost, the &quot;[[natural price]]&quot;.  Even as profits are zeroed out at the &quot;natural price,&quot; there would be incentives to produce goods and services, as all costs of production, including compensation for the owner's labour, are also built into the price of the goods.  If prices dipped below a zero profit, producers would drop out of the market; if they were above a zero profit, producers would enter the market. Smith believed that while human motives are often [[selfishness|selfish]] and [[Greed (emotion)|greedy]], the competition in the free market would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and argued against the formation of [[monopoly|monopolies]].

Smith vigorously attacked the antiquated government restrictions which he thought were hindering industrial expansion. In fact, he attacked most forms of government interference in the economic process, including [[tariff]]s, arguing that this creates inefficiency and high prices in the long run. This theory, now referred to as &quot;[[laissez-faire]]&quot;, which means &quot;let them do&quot;, influenced government legislation in later years, especially during the [[19th century]]. (However, it must be remembered that Smith advocated for a Government that was active in sectors other than the economy: he advocated for public education of poor adults; for institutional systems that were not profitable for private industries; for a judiciary; and for a standing army.) 

Two of the most famous and oft-quoted passages in ''The Wealth of Nations'' are:

:''It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.''

:''As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual value of society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.''

==''The &quot;Adam Smith-Problem&quot;''==
{{liberalism}}
There has been considerable controversy as to whether there is a contradiction between Smith's emphasis on sympathy in his ''Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and the key role of self-interest in ''The Wealth of Nations''.  Economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] referred to this in German as ''[[:de:Adam-Smith-Problem|das 'Adam Smith-Problem']]''. In his ''Moral Sentiments'' Smith seems to emphasize the broad synchronization of human intention and behaviour under a beneficent Providence, while in ''The Wealth of Nations'', in spite of the general theme of &quot;the invisible hand&quot; Adam Smith makes the claim that, within the system of capitalism, an individual acting for his own good tends also to promote the good of his community. creating harmony out of conflicting self-interests, he finds many more occasions for pointing out cases of conflict and of the narrow selfishness of human motives.  Yet it would be inaccurate to describe the Adam Smith of the ''Moral Sentiments'' as disbelieving of an essential selfishness of most human motives, for he writes that:
:''Thus self-preservation, and the propagation of the species, are the great ends which Nature seems to have proposed in the formation of all animals. Mankind are endowed with a desire of those ends, and an aversion to the contrary; with a love of life, and a dread of dissolution; with a desire of the continuance and perpetuity of the species, and with an aversion to the thoughts of its entire extinction. But though we are in this manner endowed with a very strong desire of those ends, it has not been entrusted to the slow and uncertain determinations of our reason, to find out the proper means of bringing them about. Nature has directed us to the greater part of these by original and immediate instincts. Hunger, thirst, the passion which unites the two sexes, the love of pleasure, and the dread of pain, prompt us to apply those means for their own sakes, and without any consideration of their tendency to those beneficent ends which the great Director of nature intended to produce by them.''

Adam Smith himself cannot have seen any contradiction, since he produced a slightly revised edition of ''Moral Sentiments'' after the publication of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''.  Both sets of ideas are to be found in his [[Lectures on Jurisprudence]].  He may have believed that moral sentiments and self-interest would always add up to the same thing.

Some scholars have given another explanation: Adam Smith was trying to illustrate the complicated economy with two simple dimensions. It was the people who, due to historical limitations, emphasized the &quot;wealth&quot; part.  In the future, due to the change of world economy, the emphasis may well change.

==Influence==
''The Wealth of Nations'', and to a lesser extent ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', have become the starting point for any defence or critique of forms of [[capitalism]], most influentially in the writings of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Humanism|Humanist]] [[economist]]s. Because capitalism is so often associated with unbridled [[selfishness]], there is a recent movement to emphasize the moral philosophy of Smith, with its focus on [[sympathy]] with one's fellows.

There has been some controversy over the extent of Smith's originality in ''The Wealth of Nations''; some argue that the work added modestly to the already established ideas of thinkers such as [[Anders Chydenius]] ([[The National Gain]] (1765)), [[David Hume]] and the [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]. Indeed, many of the theories Smith sets out simply describe historical trends away from [[mercantilism]], towards [[free trade]], that had been developing for many decades, and had already had significant influence on governmental policy.  Nevertheless, it organizes their ideas comprehensively, and remains one of the most influential and important books in the field today.

Smith was ranked #30 in [[Michael H. Hart]]'s [[The 100|list of the most influential figures in history]].

'''Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier''' ([[August 26]] [[1743]] &amp;ndash; [[May 8]] [[1794]]) was a [[France|French]] [[nobility|nobleman]] prominent in the histories of [[chemistry]], [[finance]], [[biology]], and [[economics]]. The &quot;''[[List of people known as the father or mother of something|father of modern chemistry]]''&quot;, he stated the first version of the [[Law of Conservation of Matter]], recognized and named [[oxygen]] ([[1778]]), disproved the [[phlogiston theory]], and helped to reform chemical nomenclature.  He was also an investor and administrator of the ''[[Ferme Générale]]'', a private tax collection company; chairman of the board of the [[Discount Bank]] (later the [[Banque de France]]); and a powerful member of a number of other aristocratic administrative councils. Due to his prominence in the pre-revolutionary government in [[France]], he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] at the height of the [[French Revolution]].

==Early life==
[[Image:David_Portrait_of_Monsieur_Lavoisier.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Portrait of Monsieur Lavoisier and his Wife'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]].]]
Born to a wealthy family in [[Paris]], Antoine Laurent Lavoisier inherited a large fortune when his mother died. He attended the [[College Mazarin]] from [[1754]] to [[1761]], studying [[chemistry]], [[botany]], [[astronomy]], and [[mathematics]]. His education was filled with the ideals of the French [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the time, he felt fascination for [[Maquois|Maquois's]] dictionary. His devotion and passion for chemistry was largely influenced by [[Étienne Condillac]], a prominent French scholar of the [[18th century]]. His first chemical publication appeared in [[1764]]. In [[1767]] he worked on a geological survey of [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. He was elected a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], France's most elite scientific society, at the age of 25 in [[1768]] for an essay on street lighting and in recognition for his earlier research. In [[1769]] he worked on the first geological map of [[France]]. 

In [[1771]], he married 13-year-old [[Marie-Anne Pierette Paulze]], the daughter of a co-owner of the Ferme. With time, she proved to be a scientific colleague to her husband. She translated documents from English for him, including [[Richard Kirwan]]'s &quot;''Essay on Phlogiston''&quot; and [[Joseph Priestley]]'s research. She created many [[drawing|sketches]] and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by Lavoisier and his colleagues. She also edited and published Lavoisier’s memoirs and hosted many parties during which eminent scientists would discuss new chemical theories. As a result of her close work with her husband, it is difficult to separate her individual contributions from his, but it is correctly assumed that much of the work accredited to him bears her fingerprints.

==Contributions to chemistry==
[[Image:Antoine_lavoisier.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Portrait]] of Antoine Lavoisier in his youth.]]

===Background===
Beginning in [[1775]], he served in the [[Royal Gunpowder Administration]], where his work led to improvements in the production of [[gunpowder]] and the use of [[agricultural chemistry]] by designing a new method for preparing [[saltpeter]].
[[Image:Hidrogenexp1.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Drawing|Hand sketch]] design aparatus for hydrogen combustion experiment made by Lavoisier in the [[1780s]].]]
===Major works===
Some of Lavoisier's most important experiments examined the nature of [[combustion]], or burning. Through these experiments, he demonstrated that burning is a process that involves the combination of a substance with oxygen. He also demonstrated the role of oxygen in metal rusting, as well as its role in animal and plant respiration: working with [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], Lavoisier conducted experiments that showed that respiration was essentially a slow combustion of organic material using inhaled oxygen. Lavoisier's explanation of combustion replaced the [[phlogiston]] theory, which postulates that materials release a substance called phlogiston when they burn. 
===Research on hydrogen and role disproving Phlogiston theory===
[[Image:Hidrogenexp2.gif|thumb|170px|right|Aparatus for hydrogen combustion experiment made from Lavoisier's sketch by Jean Baptiste Meusnier in [[1783]].]]
He also discovered that the inflammable air of [[Henry Cavendish]] which he termed ''[[hydrogen]]'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for &quot;water-former&quot;), combined with oxygen to produce a dew, as [[Joseph Priestley]] had reported, which appeared to be water. Lavoisier's work was partly based on the work of Priestley (he corresponded with Priestley and fellow members of the [[Lunar Society]]). However, he tried to take credit for Priestley's discoveries. This tendency to use the results of others without acknowledgment, then draw conclusions is said to be characteristic of Lavoisier. In ''Sur la combustion en general'' (''On Combustion in general'', [[1777]]) and ''Considérations Générales sur la Nature des Acides'' (''General Considerations on the Nature of Acids''), [[1778]]), he demonstrated that the &quot;air&quot; responsible for combustion was also the source of acidity. In [[1779]], he named this part of the air ''oxygen'' (Greek for &quot;acid-former&quot;), and the other ''azote'' (Greek for &quot;no life&quot;). In ''Reflexions sur le Phlogistique'' (''Reflections on Phlogiston'', [[1783]]), Lavoisier showed the [[phlogiston theory]] to be inconsistent.

===Pioneer of [[Stoichiometry]]===
[[Image:Instruments_lavoisier.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Laboratory equipment|Laboratory instruments]] used by Lavoisier circa [[1780s]].]]
Lavoisier's experiments were among the first truly quantitative chemical experiments ever performed; that is, he carefully weighed the reactants and products involved, a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry. He showed that, although matter changes its state in a chemical reaction, the quantity of matter is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical reaction. He burnt phosphorus and sulfur in air, and proved that the products weighed more than the original. Nevertheless, the weight gained was lost from the air. These experiments provided evidence for the law of the conservation of matter, or in other words, '''the law of conservation of mass .'''

===Major works on analytical chemistry and chemical nomenclature===
Lavoisier also investigated the composition of water and air, which at the time were considered elements. He discovered the components of water were oxygen and hydrogen, and that air was a mixture of gases - primarily [[nitrogen]] and oxygen. With the French chemists [[Claude-Louis Berthollet]], Antoine Fourcroy and Guyton de Morveau, Lavoisier devised a chemical nomenclature, or a system of names describing the structure of chemical compounds. He described it in ''Méthode de nomenclature chimique'' (''Method of Chemical Nomenclature'', [[1787]]). Their system facilitated communication of discoveries between chemists of different backgrounds and is still largely in use today, including names such as sulfuric acid, sulfates, and sulfites. 
[[Image:Lavoisiers_lab.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A replica of Lavoisier's laboratory at the ''Deutsches Museum'' in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].]]
His ''Traité Élémentaire de Chimie (Elementary Treatise of Chemistry'', [[1789]], translated into English by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]]) is considered to be the first modern chemical [[textbook]], and presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement of the [[Law of Conservation of Mass]], and denied the existence of phlogiston. Also, Lavoisier clarified the concept of an element as a simple substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis, and he devised a theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements. 

[[Image:Lentilles_ardentes.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Combustion, generated by focusing sun light over [[flammable]] materials using lenses, experiment conducted by Lavosier circa [[1770s]].]]
In addition, it contained a list of elements, or substances that could not be broken down further, which included oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]], and [[sulphur]]. It also forms the basis for the modern list of elements. His list, however, also included light and [[Caloric theory|caloric]], which he believed to be material substances. While many leading chemists of the time refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation.
[[Image:Zoom_lunette_ardente.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Lavoisier while conducting combustion experiment.]] 
===Aftermath===
Lavoisier's fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of [[chemical balance]], used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids (which later turned out to be erroneous). Lavoisier also made introductory research on physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiment with [[Laplace]], when he used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of carbon dioxide produced, eventually they found the same ratio for a flame and animals, indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion. 
[[Image:Calorimeter.gif|thumb|115px|left|Constant [[pressure]] [[calorimeter]] made by Lavoisier for chemical [[enthalpy]] experiment.]]

He also made remarkable contributions to [[chemical bond|chemical bonding]] by stating the radical theory, believing that radicals, which function as a single group in a chemical reaction, would combine with oxygen in reactions. He also introduced the possibility of [[allotropy|allotropy in chemical elements]] when he discovered that [[diamond]] is a crystalline form of carbon.

He also updated many chemical concepts, for the first time the modern notion of elements was laided out systematically; the three or four elements of classical chemistry gave way to the modern system, and Lavoisier worked out reactions in chemical equations that respect the conservation of mass (see, for example, the [[nitrogen cycle]]).[[Image:Lavoisier_humanexp.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Lavoisier conducting an experiment in the [[1770s]].]] 
His contributions are considered the most important in advancing the science of chemistry to the level of what had been achieved in physics and mathematics during [[18th century]].

==Law and politics==
Of key significance in Lavoisier's life was his study of [[law]]. He received a [[law degree]] and was admitted to the [[bar association|bar]], but never practiced as a [[lawyer]]. He did become interested in French [[politics]], and as a result, he obtained a position as [[tax]] collector in the ''[[Ferme Générale]]'', a [[tax farming]] company, at the age of 26, where he attempted to introduce reforms in the French [[monetary system|monetary]] and [[tax]]ation system. While in government work, he helped develop the [[SI|metric system]] to secure uniformity of [[weights and measures]] throughout France.

==Execution==
As one of 28 French tax collectors and a powerful figure in the unpopular Ferme Générale, Lavoisier was branded a traitor during the Reign of Terror by [[French Revolution|revolutionists]] in 1794, and tried, convicted and [[guillotine|guillotined]] all on one day in Paris, at the age of 51. Ironically, Lavoisier was one of the few liberals in his position. One of his actions that may have sealed his fate was a contretemps a few years earlier with the young [[Jean-Paul Marat|Jean-Paul Marat]], who subsequently became a leading revolutionary.

An appeal to spare his life was cut short by the judge: &quot;The Republic has no need of geniuses [or, alternately, &quot;scientists.&quot;].&quot;  His importance for science was expressed by the mathematician [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] who lamented the beheading by saying: &quot;It took them only an instant to cut off that head, but France may not produce another like it in a century.&quot;

One and a half years following his death, Lavoisier was exonerated by the French government. When his private belongings were delivered to his widow, a brief note was included reading &quot;To the widow of Lavoisier, who was falsely convicted.&quot;

About a century after his death, a statue of Lavoisier was erected in Paris. It was later discovered that the sculptor had not actually copied Lavoisier's head for the statue, but used a spare head of the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], the Secretary of the Academy of Sciences during Lavoisier's last years. Lack of money prevented alterations being made and, in any case, the French argued pragmatically that all men in wigs looked alike anyway. The statue was melted down during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and has never been replaced.

== Can a severed head think? ==
A story relates how Lavoisier arranged a final experiment at his death intended to determine whether and for how long a severed head remains conscious after [[decapitation]]. Supposedly, Lavoisier decided to blink as many times as possible, and had an assistant count the blinks, which numbered between 15 and 20. The story may be apocryphal. Standard biographies have never mentioned the incident, and some biologists have expressed skepticism that it would be possible. However romantic, the story is false.[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_262.html]

'''Alan Cox''' (born 1968) is a [[programmer]] heavily involved in the development of the [[Linux kernel]] since its early days (1991). Whilst employed on the campus of [[University of Wales, Swansea]], he installed a very early version of [[Linux]] on one of the machines belonging to the [[Swansea University Computer Society|university computer society]]. This was one of the first Linux installations on a busy [[computer network| network]], and revealed many bugs in the networking code. Cox fixed many of these bugs, and went on to rewrite much of the networking subsystem. He then became one of the main developers and maintainers of the whole kernel. 
[[Image:With-alan-cox.jpg|thumb|Alan Cox, wearing a red hat, with two [[Gentoo]] developers at the LinuxWorld Expo 2005]]
He maintained an old  branch (2.2.x), and his own versions of the previous stable branch (2.4.x) (signified by an &quot;ac&quot; in the version, for example 2.4.13-ac1). This branch was very stable and contained bugfixes that went directly into the vendor kernels. He was once commonly regarded as being the &quot;second in command&quot; after [[Linus Torvalds]] himself. His dense and friendly comments have guided many programmers on the [[linux kernel mailing list]]. Alan is employed by [[Red Hat]] and lives in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]] with his wife, Telsa Gwynne. Since then he has also been involved in the [[GNOME]] and [[Xorg]] projects.

He was the main developer of [[AberMUD]], which he wrote whilst a student at the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]].

He is an ardent supporter of programming freedom, and an outspoken opponent of [[software patent]]s, the [[DMCA]] and the [[CBDTPA]]. He resigned from a subgroup of [[Usenix]] in protest, and said he would not visit the [[United States]] for fear of being imprisoned after the arrest of [[Dmitry Sklyarov]] for DMCA violations.

Cox was the recipient of the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s [[2003]] [[FSF Award for the Advancement of Free Software|Award for the Advancement of Free Software]] at the [[FOSDEM]] conference in [[Brussels]].

On October 5th 2005, Cox received a lifetime achievement award at the [[LinuxWorld]] awards in London.

'''Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe''' ([[September 27]], [[1818]] &amp;ndash; [[November 25]], [[1884]]) was a [[chemist]].

Kolbe was born in Elliehausen near [[Hanover]], [[Germany]].

He became an assistant to [[Robert Wilhelm Bunsen]] at the [[University of Marburg]] in [[1842]], after studying [[chemistry]] with [[Friedrich Woehler|Friedrich Wöhler]]. Subsequently he assisted [[Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair|Lyon Playfair]] at the University of [[London]] and from 1847 to 1851 was engaged in editing the ''Handwörterbuch der reinen und angewandten Chemie'' (''Dictionary of Pure and Applied Chemistry'') written by [[Justus von Liebig]] and Wöhler. Kolbe then succeeded Bunsen at Marburg, and in 1865 he went to the University of [[Leipzig]].

At that time, it was believed that organic and [[inorganic compound]]s are independent from each other, and that organic compounds could  be created only by living organisms. Kolbe believed that [[organic compound]]s could be derived from inorganic ones, directly or indirectly, by substitution processes. He validated his theory by converting [[carbon disulfide]], in several steps, to [[acetic acid]] (1843-45). Introducing a modified idea of structural [[free radical|radicals]], he contributed to the establishment of [[structural theory]]. He also predicted the existence of secondary and tertiary [[alcohol]]s. 

He worked on the [[electrolysis]] of the salts of [[fatty acid|fatty]] and other [[acid]]s ([[Kolbe electrolysis]]) and prepared [[salicylic acid]], a building block of [[aspirin]] in a process called [[Kolbe synthesis]] or [[Kolbe-Schmitt reaction]].
 
With [[Edward Frankland]] he found that [[nitrile]]s can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids. As editor of the ''Journal für praktische Chemie'' (''Journal of practical chemistry'', 1869), he was sometimes severely critical of the work of others.

He died in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]]

'''Amitabh Bachchan''' (born [[October 11]], [[1942]], in [[Allahabad]], [[India]]) also known as '''Big B''', is an iconic [[India]]n [[actor]] whose [[Bollywood]] career has spanned four decades. He was declared Superstar of the Millennium in 1999 in an international poll hosted by the [[BBC]].

==Biography==
Amitabh was born to Teji and [[Harivansh Rai 'Bachchan']]. Harivansh Rai was a well-known [[Hindi]] poet. Amitabh attended Boys' High School in [[Allahabad]] followed by [[Sherwood College]] in [[Nainital]] and went on to [[Delhi University]] to earn a degree in science. 

He gave up his job as a freight broker for the shipping firm Bird and Company in Calcutta to pursue an acting career. He entered FTII Pune (the Film And Television Institute of India at Pune). Jaya Bhaduri (whom he later married), Anil Dhawan (director David Dhawan's brother), Shatrughan Sinha, Romesh Sharma, Danny Denzongpa, and Amitabh were all classmates at FTII Pune.

Bachchan began his acting career in 1969 with ''[[Saat Hindustani]]''. He became well known as a [[movie star]] in 1973, with the films ''[[Abhimaan]]'' and ''[[Zanjeer]]''.  

In 1982, Bachchan was injured while filming on the set of ''[[Coolie]]''. People were so concerned about his health that they thronged to temples and prayed for his life and quick recovery. He recovered and resumed making films. Popular interest in his injury had been so high that when ''Coolie'' was released, it featured a freeze-frame and caption, isolating the exact instant during a fight scene when Amitabh was hurt.

While his popularity waned in the [[1990s]], Bachchan made a comeback in the early [[2000s]] by hosting ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]'', the Indian version of ''[[Who Wants to be a Millionaire]]''.

Bachchan married actress [[Jaya Bhaduri]] in 1973. He has co-starred with Jaya in many films: ''[[Zanjeer]]'', ''[[Abhimaan]]'', ''Milli'', ''Chupke Chupke'',''[[Sholay]]'', ''[[Silsila]]'' and, ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham]]''. They have two children: [[Shweta Bachchan-Nanda]] and [[Abhishek Bachchan]]. Abhishek Bachchan has  followed in his father's footsteps, having starred in a number of movies.

==Career==
Bachchan's first film was ''[[Saat Hindustani]]'' (1969). He became well known as a [[movie star]] in 1973 following the success of ''[[Abhimaan]]'' and ''[[Zanjeer]]''.

Amitabh's most loved films and characters date from this period. Fans remember him from box office hits like ''[[Sholay]]'', ''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]'', ''[[Trishul]]'', ''[[Don]]'', ''[[Deewar ]]'' and more recently in ''Baghban''. Amitabh often played an angry young man fighting a corrupt establishment -- a theme that had immense appeal in India during that time. The screen-writing duo of [[Salim-Javed]] [http://www.upperstall.com/people/salimjaved.html] have often been credited with creating this persona. In a sense, the relationship was symbiotic. Neither Salim-Javed nor Amitabh have since attained the level of success they achieved with their collaborations.

Amitabh is famous for playing a person who is angry with the whole system, doesn't believe in God and replies back to evils of society, a person who believes in right and does right, a person who doesn't bow before anyone else except his mother. As a result of portraying these kind of images in the films he worked, the people and media call him &quot;an [[Angry young man]]&quot;. 

In an era where producers looked to cast a handsome full-bodied man as the hero, Amitabh was written off, due to his unconventional looks and tall, lanky frame.  His baritone (since regarded as his biggest asset) once failed to get him a job as a [[news presenter]] at [[All India Radio]]. The success of ''Zanjeer'' and ''Sholay'' turned that around. Audiences adored his on-screen presence and a flair for comedy. 

Many of his films in the 1970s followed a set formula: a poor childhood, parents murdered or separated after birth, survival through street-smart instincts, entry of a villain (usually a social oppressor or smuggler or his parents' killer or long lost father), some comedy scenes, a drunk scene, songs, dances, an action finale and a dying speech. It can be argued that the Salim-Javed stories written for Amitabh during the 1970s form an informal sequel, with the same character being played out in various settings. 

Critics would regard most of these 1970s films as run-of-the-mill ''masala'' movies with creaking plots and sub-par production values. However, Amitabh's persona lifted them to incredible heights of popularity. 

He continued making films all through the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]], but his appeal seemed to have waned. Though a few of his movies were successful (''[[Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan]]'' and ''[[Mohabbatein]]''), critics said that they succeeded due to Amitabh's co-stars, [[Govinda (actor)|Govinda]] and [[Shahrukh Khan]]. Industry gossip said that Amitabh was finished as an actor. 

Then Amitabh proved the critics wrong. First came the fan accolades. In 1999, in a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] Online Poll, he was named the Superstar of the Millennium. In [[June]] [[2000]] he became the first living [[Asian]] to have a wax statue erected in his honor at [[Madame Tussaud's]].

In 2000, he was chosen as the host for ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]'', the Indian version of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''. The show became an enormous hit. While the show 
was on, street traffic dropped dramatically; restaurants and movie theaters complained of diminishing clientèle. Critics were forced to admit that Amitabh could still pull big crowds. The show was aired again as ''Kaun Banega Crorepati 2'', with a prize money double the first version.

The reason for the popularity of Amitabh has probably been the uncanny portrayal of the Indian consciousness in his roles. We can see the development of 70's India to the corporate setup of the present era. In this transformation the identity of &quot;Indian-ness&quot; is not lost.

Since his game show success, he has appeared in several hit movies. He has also appeared in many [[Advertising|ads]] for commercial products and for various [[non-profit organization]]s. He has supported campaigns for eye donations and against [[polio]] and [[AIDS]].

==Public life==
In 1984, Bachchan briefly entered politics in support of long-time family friend [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. He contested Allahabad's parliament seat against H. N. Bahuguna, a well-known politician and won (winning 68.2% of the vote). {{ref|election}} However, his political career was short-lived; he resigned after three years before finishing his term. At the time of his resignation, it was rumored that he might have been involved in the [[Bofors scandal]]. Bachchan was not implicated in the corruption and has since distanced himself from the Gandhi family. Bachchan denies that the these events were connected, commenting that he &quot;should have never got into politics.&quot; {{ref|politics}}

In 1995, Amitabh went into business, founding Amitabh Bachchan Corporation Ltd., an entertainment company that specialized in film production and event management. The company did not succeed and Bachchan was pushed into huge debt when a big-budget production bombed at the Bollywood box office. He did not, however, file for bankruptcy. Apart from what is a commonly held belief that influential public figures such as Sahara Group chairman Subroto Roy and politician Amar Singh helped bail Bachchan financially out of his debts, the actor also took on visibly more acting and endorsing contracts to pay off his creditors. According to most accounts, with his return to the small screen for a second season of Kaun Banega Crorepati, his debts may have been completely cleared in 2005. Some observers speculate that he will try to revive his company.

He was admited to hospital in November 2005 for Ulcerative Colitis. For weeks this formed the basis of the main news stories in the Indian media. Such is the popularity of Amitabh that prayers were held all over India and special ‘pujas' conducted, in scenes reminiscient of the Coolie film accident. 

In 2006, Indian National Organisation for Tobacco Eradication (Note) accused Bachchan of breaking national law by appearing smoking a cigar on advertising posters for the film ''Family''. India's government banned tobacco advertisements in 2003, and Note threatened the film star with legal action.

==Trivia==
Amitabh Bachchan has played a character named Vijay in at least seventeen of his films!  Veteran Hindi actor Raaj Kumar was first approached to play the role of Police Inspector in Zanjeer, for some reason Raaj Kumar (who was known for his eccentric mannerisms)didn't accept the role and the role went to Amitabh.  Had Raaj Kumar accepted the Zanjeer's hero's role, Amitabh might not have been what he is today.

==Awards==
Bachchan has received the [[Padma Shri]] (1983) and  [[Padma Bhushan]] (2005), civilian honours from the [[Government of India|Indian government]]. In 1990, he won the National Award for his portrayal of a mafia don in ''Agneepath''. In 1999, he was named [[BBC]] Superstar of the Millennium. He has also won 14 [[Filmfare Award]]s in various categories.He recently won the 2006 FilmFare award for best actor for his role in film Black.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- Keep this note! Technical term, necessary for wikipedia articles; don't assign for wiktionary --&gt;
''This article is about a lingustic term. See [[Pseudomorph]] for another meaning of the word.''
----
In [[linguistics]] an '''allomorph''' is a variant form of a [[morpheme]]. The meaning remains the same, while the sound can vary.

For example, in the [[English language]] the past tense morpheme is -ed.  It occurs in several allomorphs depending on its phonological environment, assimilating voicing of the previous segment or inserting a [[schwa]] when following an alveolar stop:

* as {{IPA|/əd/}} in 'hunted' or 'banded',
* as {{IPA|/d/}} in 'buzzed', 
* as {{IPA|/t/}} in 'fished'

Allomorphy can also exist in case distinctions, as in Classic [[Sanskrit]]:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+'''Vāk''' (voice)
|-
!  
!'''Singular'''
!'''Plural'''
|-
! [[Nominative]]
|{{IPA|/va&amp;#720;k/}}
|{{IPA|/va&amp;#720;&amp;#679;-as/}}
|- 
! [[Genitive case|Genitive]]
|{{IPA|/va&amp;#720;&amp;#679;-as/}}
|{{IPA|/va&amp;#720;&amp;#679;-a&amp;#720;m/}}
|-
! [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]]
|{{IPA|/va&amp;#720;&amp;#679;-a&amp;#720;/}}
|{{IPA|/va&amp;#720;g-b&amp;#689;is/}}
|-
! [[Locative case|Locative]]
|{{IPA|/va&amp;#720;&amp;#679;-i/}}
|{{IPA|/va&amp;#720;k-&amp;#642;i/}}
|}

The nominative {{IPA|/va&amp;#720;k/}} is the basic form of the morpheme and, because of Pre-Indic palatalazation of [[velars]] and the merging of {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} into {{IPA|/a/}} (making the alternation unpredictable on phonetic grounds), morphophonemic variation has occurred that isn’t directly related to phonological processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This article is about the sense of &quot;allophone&quot; used in linguistics.  For other senses, see [[allophone (disambiguation)]].''

In [[phonetics]], an '''allophone''' is one of several similar [[phone]]s that belong to the same [[phoneme]]. A phone is a sound that has a definite shape as a sound wave, while a phoneme is a basic group of sounds that can distinguish words (i.e. changing one phoneme in a word can produce another word); speakers of a particular language perceive a phoneme as a single distinctive sound in that language.  Thus an allophone is a phone considered as a member of one phoneme.  

Each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and many times there is some sort of [[phonology|phonological]] process.  Not all phonemes have significantly different allophones, but there are always minor differences in articulation from one piece of speech to the next.  

For example, {{IPA|[p&amp;#688;]}} as in ''pin'' and {{IPA|[p]}} as in ''cap'' are allophones for the phoneme /p/ in the [[English language]] because they occur in [[complementary distribution]]. English speakers generally treat these as the same sound, but they are different.  The latter is [[unaspirated]] (plain):  if plain {{IPA|[p]}} is also found in words such as the second '''p''' in ''paper'' {{IPA|[p&amp;#688;eɪ.pɚ]}} or ''spin'' {{IPA|[spɪn]}}. Outside of contexts that plain '''p''' appears in English, speakers may hear it as '''b''' since English '''b''' is typically unaspirated. 

[[Chinese language|Chinese]] treats these two phones differently and the latter is always written as '''b''' in [[pinyin]]; thus, they are not allophones in Chinese.

Similarly, English-speaking people may become aware of the difference between two allophones of the phoneme '''t'''  when they consider the pronunciations of the following phrases:

:night rate
:nitrate

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''affix''' is a [[morpheme]] that is attached to a base morpheme such as a [[root (linguistics)|root]] or to a [[stem (linguistics)|stem]], to form a word. Affixes may be [[derivation_(linguistics)|derivational]], like English ''-ness'' and ''pre-'', or [[inflection|inflectional]], like English plural ''-s'' and past tense ''-ed''.

==Types of affixes==
Affixes are divided into several types, depending on their position with reference to the root: 

* [[Prefix]]es (attached before another morpheme)
* [[Suffix]]es (attached after another morpheme)
* [[Infix]]es (inserted within another morpheme)
* [[Circumfix]]es (attached before and after another morpheme or set of morphemes)
* [[Interfix]]es (semantically empty linking elements in compounds)
* [[Suprafix]]es (also ''superfix'', attached [[suprasegmental]]ly to another morpheme)
* [[Simulfix]]es (also ''transfix'' or ''root-and-pattern morphology'', discontinuous affix interweaved throughout a discontinuous base) 
* [[Duplifix]] (little used term referring to affix composed of both a reduplicated and non-reduplicated element, see [[Reduplication#Reduplication and other processes|Reduplication and other processes]])

Affixes are [[bound morpheme]]s by definition.  Prefixes and suffixes may be [[separable affix]]es.

There also has been a proposal of a somewhat different type of affix, a ''[[disfix]]'' or ''subtractive morpheme'', which subtracts phonological segments from bases.

Affixes are central to the process of [[concatenation]].

|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| prefix || &lt;u&gt;''un''&lt;/u&gt;do&lt;br&gt;''prefix'' + root
|- align=&quot;center&quot;

|- align=&quot;center&quot;

|- align=&quot;center&quot;

|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| suprafix || '''pro'''duce (noun)&lt;br&gt;pro'''duce''' (verb)&lt;br&gt;(changing [[lexical stress|stress]])
|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; [[English language|English]] [[tmesis|tmeses]], as in this example, are by some considered infixes.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==Lexical affixes==

''Lexical affixes'' (or ''semantic affixes'') are bound elements that appear as affixes, but function as [[incorporated noun]]s within verbs and as elements of [[compound noun]]s. In other words, they are similar to word roots/stems in function but similar to affixes in form. Although similar to incorporated nouns, lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as affixes. 

Lexical affixes are relatively rare. The [[Wakashan languages|Wakashan]], [[Salishan languages|Salishan]], and [[Chimakuan languages|Chimakuan]] languages all have lexical suffixes — the presence of these is an [[areal feature]] of the Pacific Northwest of the [[North America]].

The lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings. Compare the lexical suffixes and free nouns of [[Saanich language|Northern Straits Saanich]] written in the Saanich orthography and in [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist notation]]:

| &quot;building, house, campsite&quot;
| ,Á,LEṈ
| ʔeʔləŋ
| &quot;house&quot;
|}

Lexical suffixes when compared with free nouns often have a more generic or general meaning. For instance, one of these languages may have a lexical suffix that means water in a general sense, but it may not have any noun equivalent referring to water in general and instead have several nouns with a more specific meaning (such &quot;saltwater&quot;, &quot;whitewater&quot;, etc.). In other cases, the lexical suffixes have become [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to various degrees.

Some linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs. Other linguists disagree arguing that they may additionally be syntactic [[Verb argument|arguments]] just as free nouns are and thus equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns. Gerdts (2003) gives examples of lexical suffixes in the [[Halkomelem language]] (the [[word order]] here is [[Verb Subject Object]]):

|}

In sentence (1), the verb &quot;bathe&quot; is {{unicode|'''šak’ʷətəs'''}} where {{unicode|'''šak’ʷ-'''}} is the root and {{unicode|'''-ət'''}} and {{unicode|'''-əs'''}} are inflectional suffixes. The subject &quot;the woman&quot; is {{unicode|'''łə słeniʔ'''}} and the object &lt;span style=&quot;color:#008000&quot;&gt;&quot;the baby&quot;&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span style=&quot;color:#008000&quot;&gt;{{unicode|'''łə qeq'''}}&lt;/span&gt;. In this sentence, &quot;the baby&quot; is a free noun. (The {{unicode|'''niʔ'''}} here is an [[auxiliary]], which can be ignored for explanatory purposes.) 

In sentence (2), &lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;&quot;the/a baby&quot;&lt;/span&gt; does not appear as a free noun. Instead it appears as the lexical suffix &lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;{{unicode|'''-əyəł'''}}&lt;/span&gt; which is affixed to the verb root {{unicode|'''šk’ʷ-'''}} (which has changed slightly in pronunciation, but this can also be ignored here). Note how the lexical suffix may be translated as either &quot;the baby&quot; (definite) or &quot;a baby&quot; (indefinite): this change in [[definiteness]] is a common change in meaning that happens with incorporated nouns.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''allegory''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;alpha;&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;, ''allos'', &quot;other&quot;, and &amp;alpha;&amp;gamma;&amp;omicron;&amp;rho;&amp;epsilon;&amp;upsilon;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;nu;, ''agoreuein,'' &quot;to speak in public&quot;) is a figurative mode of [[representation (arts)|representation]] conveying a [[meaning]] other than and in addition to the literal. Through allegory a subject of a higher spiritual order is described in terms of that of a lower which is made out to resemble it in properties and circumstances, the principal subject being so kept out of view that we are left to construe the drift of it from the resemblance of the two subjects.

Allegory is generally treated as a figure of [[rhetoric]], but an allegory does not have to be expressed in [[language]]: it may be addressed to the eye, and is often found in [[painting]], [[sculpture]] or some form of [[mimetic art]].  The [[etymology|etymological]] meaning of the word is wider than that which it bears in actual use.  Though it is similar to other rhetorical comparisons, an allegory is sustained longer and more fully in its details than a [[metaphor]], and appeals to imagination where an [[analogy]] appeals to reason.  The [[fable]] or [[parable]] is a short allegory with one definite moral.

[[Northrop Frye]] discussed the continuum of allegory from what he termed the &quot;naive allegory&quot; of ''The Faerie Queen'' to the more private allegories of modern paradox literature. The characters in a &quot;naive&quot; allegory are not fully three-dimensional, for each aspect of their individual personalities and the events that befall them embodies some moral quality or other abstraction. The allegory has been selected first: the details merely flesh it out.

Since meaningful stories are always applicable to larger issues, allegories may be read into many stories, sometimes distorting their author's overt meaning. For instance, many people have suggested that [[The Lord of the Rings]] was an allegory for the [[world war|World Wars]], an interpretation which the author sharply denied, stating, &quot;I cordially dislike allegory in all of its manifestations.&quot;

The allegory has been a favourite form in the literature of nearly every nation.  The Hebrew scriptures present frequent instances of it, an example of which is the comparison of the history of Israel to the growth 
of a vine in {{Bibleverse|Psalm||80:8-17|}}. In the Rabbinic tradition fully-developed allegorical readings were applied to every text, with every detail of the narrative given an [[emblem]]atic reading.  A particularly important case is the [[Song of Solomon|Song of Songs]], which was accepted as [[Biblical canon|canonical]] only because of an allegorical reading. This tradition of Biblical interpretation was inherited by Christian writers, for whom allegorical similitudes are the basis of [[exegesis]], the origin of the arts of [[hermeneutics]]. The late Jewish and Early Christian visionary [[Apocalyptic literature]], with its base in the ''[[Book of Daniel]]'', presents allegorical figures, of which the [[Whore of Babylon]] and the Beast of ''Revelation'' are the most familiar. 

In classical literature two of the best-known allegories are the cave of shadowy representations in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic]]'' (Book VII) and the story of the stomach and its members in the speech of Menenius Agrippa ([[Livy]] ii. 32); and several occur in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]].'' In Late Antiquity [[Martianus Capella]] organized all the information a 5th-century upper-class male needed to know into an allegory of the wedding of Mercury and ''Philologia,'' with the seven [[liberal arts]] as guests, an allegory that was widely read through the Middle Ages. 

Medieval thinking accepted allegory as having a ''reality'' underlying any rhetorical or fictional uses. The allegory was as true as superficial facts. Thus, the bull ''[[Unam Sanctam]]'' (1302) presents themes of the unity of [[Christendom]] with the pope as its head in which the allegorical details of the metaphors are adduced as ''actual facts'' which take the place of a logical demonstration, employing the vocabulary of logic: &quot;''Therefore'' of this one and only Church there is one body and one head—not two heads as if it were a monster... If, then, the Greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of Peter and his successors, they ''necessarily'' confess that they are not of the sheep of Christ&quot; [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Unam_sanctam (complete text)].

In the late 15th century, the enigmatic ''[[Hypnerotomachia]]'', with its elaborate woodcut illustrations, shows the influence of themed pageants and [[masque]]s on contemporary allegorical representation, as [[Renaissance humanism|humanist dialectic]] conveyed them.

Some elaborate and successful specimens of allegory are to be found in the following works, arranged in approximately chronological order:  
* [[Aesop]] &amp;ndash; ''[[Aesop's Fables| Fables]]'' 
* [[Plato]] &amp;ndash; ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'' (''[[Plato's allegory of the cave]]'')
* [[Plato]] &amp;ndash; ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' (''[[Chariot Allegory]]'')
* ''[[Book of Revelation]]'' (for allegory in Christian theology, see [[typology (theology)]])
* [[Martianus Capella]] &amp;ndash; ''De nuptiis philologiæ et Mercurii''
* ''[[The Romance of the Rose]]''
* [[William Langland]] &amp;ndash;  ''[[Piers Plowman]]''
*[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]
* [[Dante Alighieri]] &amp;ndash; ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''
* [[Edmund Spenser]] &amp;ndash; ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''
* [[John Bunyan]] &amp;ndash; ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]''
* [[Jean de La Fontaine]] &amp;ndash; ''Fables''
* [[Jonathan Swift]] &amp;ndash; ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]''
* [[Joseph Addison]] &amp;ndash; ''Vision of Mirza''
* [[Edgar Allan Poe]] &amp;ndash; ''[[The Masque of the Red Death]]''
Modern allegories in fiction tend to operate under constraints of modern requirements for [[verisimilitude]] within conventional expectations of [[realism (arts)|realism]]. Works of fiction with strong allegorical overtones include:
* [[William Golding]] &amp;ndash; ''[[Lord of the Flies (novel)|Lord of the Flies]]''
* [[George Orwell]] &amp;ndash; ''[[Animal Farm]]''
* [[Arthur Miller]] &amp;ndash; ''[[The Crucible]]''
* [[Philip Pullman]] &amp;ndash; ''[[His Dark Materials]]''
* [[Hualing Nieh]] &amp;ndash; ''[[Mulberry and Peach]]''
* [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Linday]] &amp;ndash; ''A Voyage to Arcturus'

Where some requirements of &quot;realism&quot;, in its flexible meanings, are set aside, allegory can come more strongly to the surface, as in the work of [[Bertold Brecht]] or [[Franz Kafka]] on one hand, or on the other in science fiction and fantasy, where an element of universal application and allegorical overtones are common, from ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' to ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''.

Allegorical films include:
* [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (movie)|Metropolis]]''
* [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' 
* ''[[El Topo]]'' etc.
Allegorical artworks include:
* [[Sandro Botticelli]] &amp;ndash; ''La Primavera (Allegory of Spring)''
* [[Albrecht Dürer]] &amp;ndash; ''[[Melancholia I]]''
* [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] &amp;ndash; ''Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting''; ''Allegory of Inclination''
* [[Jan Vermeer]] &amp;ndash; ''The Allegory of Painting''

[[Image:Allotropy.jpg|thumb|right|Example of allotropic materials: graphite vs. Diamond]]
'''Allotropy''' (Gr. ''allos'', other, and ''tropos'', manner), a name 
applied by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] to the property possessed by certain 
substances of existing in forms with different chemical structures; the various forms are known as ''allotropes''. Jöns Jakob Berzelius used the name in an entirely different sense (see Macmillan Encyclopedia of Chemistry, edited by J.J.Lagowski, 1997, Simon Schuster). 

Some classic examples of elements that have allotropes are [[phosphorus]] (in &quot;red&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;purple&quot; etc. forms), [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[ozone|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[tetraoxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and [[carbon]] (in the form of [[graphite]], [[diamond]], [[fullerenes]], and others - see [[allotropes of carbon]]).  The term allotropes may also be used to refer to the molecular forms of an element (such as a diatomic gas), even if there is only one such additional form.

[[Sulfur]] is an additional example of an element with several allotropic forms. Amorphous (plastic sulfur) is produced by quickly cooling the crystalline form, generating helical structure with eight atoms per spiral. 

Allotropy specifically refers to the chemical bond structure between atoms of the same kind and should not be confused with the existence of [[phases of matter|multiple physical states]], such as with [[water]], which can exist as a [[gas]] ([[steam]]), a [[liquid]] (water), or a [[solid]] ([[ice]]).  These phases of water are not allotropes, since they are caused by changes in the physical bonding between water molecules, rather than changes in the chemical bonding of the water molecules themselves. Allotropes of an element can be in any state, gaseous, liquid, or solid. 

Allotropy usually refers to pure elemental solids, while [[allotropy|polymorphism]] may refer to elemental solids or more generally to any material having multiple crystal structures.

As can be seen with the example of carbon allotropes, certain physical properties can vary dramatically from allotrope to allotrope. In diamond, carbon [[atom]]s are connected each to four other carbon atoms in a [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] lattice structure, whereas in graphite, each carbon atom is firmly bonded to just three other carbon atoms in [[hexagon]]al sheets.  These hexagonal sheets are then more loosely coupled to one another in stacks.  The structure of fullerenes (a [[carbon]] allotrope found in [[soot]]) resembles that of graphite, except that instead of hexagons of carbon atoms, smaller regular [[polygon]]s are formed, such as a mix of hexagons and [[pentagon]]s, such that the sheet can fold back onto itself into closed [[spheroid]]s, as with the seams of a [[soccer]] ball.
Allotropes not only show dramatic differences in physical properties but also
show differences in chemical properties. Graphite can be oxidized by [[nitric acid]] to give compounds related to [[benzene]] whereas diamond does not give compounds related to benzene.

'''Agathocles''' ([[361 BC]]-[[289 BC]]), [[tyrant]] of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] ([[317 BC]]-[[289 BC]]) and king of [[Sicily]] ([[304 BC]]-[[289 BC]]).

[[Image:agathocles coin.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Coin of Agathocles.]]

He was born at Thermae Himeraeae (modern name [[Termini Imerese]]) in Sicily. The son of a [[pottery|potter]] who had moved to Syracuse in about [[343 BC]], he learned his father's trade, but afterwards entered the army. In [[333 BC]] he married the [[widow]] of his patron Damas, a distinguished and wealthy citizen. He was twice [[banishment|banished]] for attempting to overthrow the [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] party in Syracuse. 

In [[317 BC]] he returned with an army of [[mercenary|mercenaries]] under a solemn oath to observe the [[democracy|democratic]] [[constitution]] which was then set up. Having banished or murdered some 10,000 citizens, and thus made himself master of Syracuse, he created a strong army and fleet and subdued the greater part of Sicily.

War with [[Carthage]] followed. In [[311 BC]] Agathocles was [[siege|besieged]] and defeated in Syracuse in [[Battle of Himera (311 BC)|the battle of Himera]]. After defeat in [[310 BC]] he took the desperate resolve of breaking through the [[blockade]] and attacking the enemy in [[Africa]]. In Africa he concluded the treaty with [[Ophellas]], ruler of [[Cyrenaica]]. After several victories he was at last completely defeated ([[307 BC]]) and fled secretly to Sicily.  

After concluding peace with Carthage in [[306 BC]], Agathocles styled himself king of Sicily in [[304 BC]], and established his rule over the [[Greece|Greek]] cities of the island more firmly than ever. A peace treaty with Carthage left him in control of Sicily east of the [[Halycus River]]. Even in his old age he displayed the same restless energy, and is said to have been contemplating a fresh attack on Carthage at the time of his death.

His last years were harassed by ill-health and the turbulence of his grandson [[Archagathus]], at whose instigation he is said to have been [[poison|poisoned]]; according to others, he died a natural death. He was a born leader of mercenaries, and, although he did not shrink from cruelty to gain his ends, he afterwards showed himself a mild and popular &quot;tyrant.&quot; Agathocles restored the Syracusan democracy on his death bed and did not want his sons to succeed him as king.

Agathocles married [[Theoxena]], stepdaughter of [[Ptolemy I of Egypt]]. His daughter [[Lanassa]] married King [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The primary '''[[Industry|industries]] in [[Alberta]]''', [[Canada]] are [[Energy development|energy]], [[logging|lumber]], and [[Agriculture|farming]] and [[ranching]]. 

While [[gold]] and other [[mining]] operations still exist from the time of the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], they have diminished in importance as [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] extraction have achieved dominance in the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]].

Vast beds of [[coal]] are found extending for hundreds of miles, a short distance below the surface of the plains.  The coal belongs to the [[Cretaceous]] beds, and while not so heavy as that of the Coal Measures in [[England]] is of excellent quality.  In the valley of the [[Bow River]], alongside the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], valuable beds of anthracite coal are still worked.  The usual coal deposits of the Province of Alberta are of bituminous or semi-bituminous coal.  These are largely worked at [[Lethbridge, Alberta|Lethbridge]] in southern Alberta and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] in the centre of the province.  Many other parts of the province have pits for private use.

Notable gas reserves were discovered in the [[1890s]], when the town of [[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]] began using gas for lighting the town, and suppling light and fuel for the people, and a number of industries using the gas for manufacturing. In fact a large glassworks was established at Redcliff.  When Rudyard Kipling visited Medicine Hat he described it as the city &quot;with all hell for a basement.&quot;

Since the early [[1940s]], Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the [[United States]]. The [[Athabasca River]] region, as well as localities far north on the [[Mackenzie River]], produce oil for internal and external use. The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world. [[Natural gas]] has been found at several points, and in 1999, the production of natural gas liquids ([[ethane]], [[propane]], and [[butane|butanes]]) totaled 172.8 million barrels (27,000,000 m&amp;sup3;), valued at $2.27 billion. Alberta also provides 13% of all the natural gas used in the United States.  

In 1999, [[lumber]] products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area, the government allows about 23,300,000 cubic metres to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands. 

In the past, [[cattle]], [[horses]], and [[domestic sheep|sheep]] were reared in the southern prairie region on ranches or smaller holdings. Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion, as well as other livestock in lesser quanities. In this region [[irrigation]] is widely used.  [[Wheat]], accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy, is supplemented by [[canola]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[sugar beets]], and other mixed farming.

Alberta is the richest province in Canada (GDP per capita wise) and if it were its own country, it would be ranked second richest in the world (after Luxembourg). The average Albertan salary is more than $7,000 US higher than the American average.  If oil prices do not collapse, then within a few short years Albertans are expected to have not only the highest salaries in the world but also the highest quality of life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Augustin_Louis_Cauchy.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Augustin Louis Cauchy]]

'''Augustin Louis Cauchy''' ([[August 21]], [[1789]] &amp;ndash; [[May 23]],[[1857]]) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]]. He started the project of formulating and proving the theorems of [[calculus]] in a rigorous manner and was thus an early pioneer of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. He also gave several important theorems in [[complex analysis]] and initiated the study of [[permutation group]]s. A profound mathematician, Cauchy exercised by his perspicuous and rigorous methods a great influence over his contemporaries and successors. His writings cover the entire range of mathematics and [[mathematical physics]].

Having received his early education from his father [[Louis François Cauchy]] ([[1760]]&amp;ndash;[[1848]]), who held several minor public appointments and counted [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] among his friends, Cauchy entered the [[École Centrale du Panthéon]] in [[1802]], and proceeded to the [[École Polytechnique]] in [[1805]], and to the [[École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées]] in [[1807]]. Having adopted the profession of an [[Engineering|engineer]], he left [[Paris]] for [[Cherbourg]] in [[1810]], but returned in [[1813]] on account of his health, whereupon Lagrange and Laplace persuaded him to renounce engineering and to devote himself to mathematics. He obtained an appointment at the École Polytechnique, which, however, he relinquished in [[1830]] on the accession of [[Louis-Philippe_of_France|Louis-Philippe]], finding it impossible to take the necessary oaths. A short sojourn at [[Fribourg]] in [[Switzerland]] was followed by his appointment in [[1831]] to the newly-created chair of mathematical physics at the [[University of Turin]]. 

In [[1833]] the deposed king [[Charles X of France]] summoned Cauchy to be tutor to his grandson, the duke of [[Bordeaux]], an appointment which enabled Cauchy to travel and thereby become acquainted with the favourable impression which his investigations had made. Charles created him a [[baron]] in return for his services. Returning to Paris in [[1838]], Cauchy refused a proffered chair at the [[Collège de France]], but in [[1848]], the oath having been suspended, he resumed his post at the École Polytechnique, and when the oath was reinstituted after the [[coup d'état]] of [[1851]], Cauchy and [[François Arago]] were exempted from it.

Cauchy had two brothers: [[Alexandre Laurent Cauchy]] ([[1792]]&amp;ndash;[[1857]]), who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in [[1847]], and a judge of the court of cassation in [[1849]]; and [[Eugène François Cauchy]] ([[1802]]&amp;ndash;[[1877]]), a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.

The genius of Cauchy was illustrated in his simple solution of the [[Apollonian gasket|problem of Apollonius]], i.e. to describe a [[circle]] touching three given circles, which he discovered in [[1805]], his generalization of [[Euler's theorem]] on [[polyhedra]] in [[1811]], and in several other elegant problems. More important is his memoir on [[wave]] propagation, which obtained the Grand Prix of the Institut in [[1816]]. His greatest contributions to mathematical science are enveloped in the rigorous methods which he introduced. These are mainly embodied in his three great treatises, ''Cours d'analyse de l'École Polytechnique'' ([[1821]]); ''Le Calcul infinitésimal'' ([[1823]]); ''Leçons sur les applications de calcul infinitésimal''; ''La géométrie'' ([[1826]]&amp;ndash;[[1828]]); and also in his ''Courses of mechanics'' (for the École Polytechnique), ''Higher algebra'' (for the [[Faculté des Sciences]]), and of ''Mathematical physics'' (for the Collège de France). His treatises and contributions to scientific journals (to the number of 789) contain investigations on the theory of series (where he developed with perspicuous skill the notion of convergency), on the theory of numbers and complex quantities, the theory of groups and substitutions, the theory of functions, differential equations and determinants. He clarified the principles of the calculus by developing them with the aid of limits and continuity, and was the first to prove [[Taylor's theorem]] rigorously, establishing his well-known form of the remainder. In [[mechanics]], he made many researches, substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter. In [[optics]], he developed the wave theory, and his name is associated with the simple dispersion formula. In [[elasticity]], he originated the theory of [[stress (physics)|stress]], and his results are nearly as valuable as those of [[Simeon Poisson]].

He was the first to prove the [[Fermat polygonal number theorem]].

He created the [[residue theorem]] and used it to derive a whole host of most interesting series and integral formulas.

He was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers.

He discovered many of the basic formulas in the theory of [[q-series]].

His collected works, ''&amp;#338;uvres complètes d'Augustin Cauchy'', have been published in 27 volumes.

[[Image:Archimedes.jpg|thumb|right|Archimedes of Syracuse.]]
'''Archimedes''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Αρχιμηδης ) (''c''. [[287 BC]]&amp;ndash;[[212 BC]]) was an ancient Sicilian [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], [[engineer]], [[astronomer]] and [[philosopher]] born in the seaport colony of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. He is considered by some [[history of mathematics|historians of mathematics]] to be one of the greatest mathematicians in [[antiquity]]; [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] considered him one of the three greatest ever.  

==Discoveries and inventions==
[[Image:Archimedes' screw.jpg|thumb|The [[Archimedes' screw]] lifts water to higher levels for irrigation]]

Archimedes became a popular figure as a result of his involvement in the defense of Syracuse against the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[siege]] in the [[Second Punic War]]. He is reputed to have held the Romans at bay with war machines of his own design; to have been able to move a full-size ship complete with crew and cargo by pulling a single rope[http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/shipshaker2.html]; to have [[discovery (observation)|discover]]ed the principles of [[density]] and [[buoyancy]], also known as [[Archimedes' principle]], while taking a bath (thereupon taking to the streets naked he called &quot;[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]&quot;). He has also been credited with the possible invention of the [[odometer]] during the First Punic War. One of his inventions used for military defense of Syracuse against the invading Romans was the [[claw of Archimedes]]. 

[[Image:DeathRayDiagram.gif|thumb|left|A diagram showing how Archimedes may have enabled the defenders of Syracuse aim their mirrors at approaching ships]]It is said that he prevented one Roman attack on Syracuse by using a large array of [[mirror]]s (speculated to have been highly polished shields) to reflect sunlight onto the attacking ships causing them to catch fire.  This popular legend was tested on the Discovery Channel's ''[[MythBusters]]'' program. After a number of experiments, whereby the hosts of the program tried burning a model wooden ship with a variety of mirrors, they concluded that the enemy ships would have had to have been virtually motionless and very close to shore for them to ignite, an unlikely scenario during a battle.  A group at MIT subsequently performed their own tests and concluded that the mirror weapon was a possibility [http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/lectures/10_ArchimedesResult.html], although later tests of their system showed it to be ineffective in conditions that more closely matched the described siege [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/10/22/state/n121443D54.DTL]. 

Archimedes was killed by a Roman soldier in the sack of Syracuse during the Second Punic War, despite orders from the Roman general, [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]], that he was not to be harmed. The Greeks said that he was killed while drawing an equation in the sand; engrossed in his diagram and impatient with being interrupted, he is said to have muttered his [[famous last words]] before being slain by an enraged Roman soldier: Μὴ μοὺ τους κύκλους τάραττε (&quot;Don't disturb my circles&quot;).  This story was sometimes told to contrast the Greek high-mindedness with Roman ham-handedness; however, it should be noted that Archimedes designed the siege engines that devastated a substantial Roman invasion force, so his death may have been out of retribution.

In creativity and insight, he exceeded any other European mathematician prior to the European [[Renaissance]]. In a civilization with an awkward numeral system and a language in which &quot;a myriad&quot; (literally &quot;ten thousand&quot;) meant &quot;infinity&quot;, he invented a positional numeral system and used it to write numbers up to 10&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;. He devised a [[heuristic]] method based on [[statistics]] to do private calculation that we would classify today as [[integral calculus]], but then presented rigorous [[geometry|geometric]] proofs for his results. To what extent he actually had a correct version of integral calculus is debatable. He proved that the [[ratio]] of a [[circle]]'s [[perimeter]] to its [[diameter]] is the same as the ratio of the circle's area to the [[square (geometry)|square]] of the [[radius]]. He did not call this ratio [[Pi|&amp;pi;]] but he gave a procedure to approximate it to arbitrary accuracy and gave an approximation of it as between 3 + 10/71 (approximately 3.1408) and 3 + 1/7 (approximately 3.1429). He was the first [[ancient Greece|Greek]] mathematician to introduce [[mechanical]] curves (those traced by a moving point) as legitimate objects of study. He proved that the area enclosed by a [[parabola]] and a straight line is 4/3 the area of a [[triangle (geometry)|triangle]] with equal base and height.  (See the illustration below.  The &quot;base&quot; is any [[secant line]], not necessarily [[orthogonal]] to the parabola's [[axis]]; &quot;the same base&quot; means the same &quot;horizontal&quot; component of the length of the base; &quot;horizontal&quot; means orthogonal to the axis. &quot;Height&quot; means the length of the segment parallel to the axis from the [[vertex]] to the base. The vertex must be so placed that the two horizontal distances mentioned in the illustration are equal.)

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;padding:5px;text-align:center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Parabola.png]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In the process, he calculated the oldest known example of a [[geometric series]] with the [[ratio]] 1/4:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=0}^\infty 4^{-n} = 1 + 4^{-1} + 4^{-2} + 4^{-3} + \cdots = {4\over 3} \; . &lt;/math&gt;

If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle in the [[illustration]] then the second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller secant lines in the illustration. Essentially, this paragraph summarizes the proof. Archimedes also gave a quite different proof of nearly the same [[proposition]] by a method using [[infinitesimals]] (see &quot;[[How Archimedes used infinitesimals]]&quot;).

He proved that the [[area]] and volume of the [[sphere]] are in the same ratio to the area and volume of a circumscribed straight [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], a result he was so proud of that he made it his [[epitaph]].

Archimedes is probably also the first [[mathematical physicist]] on record, and the best before [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. He invented the field of [[statics]], enunciated the law of the [[lever]], the law of [[equilibrium]] of [[fluids]] and the law of [[buoyancy]]. (He famously discovered the latter when he was asked to determine whether a crown had been made of pure gold, or gold adulterated with silver; he realized that the rise in the water level when it was immersed would be equal to the volume of the crown, and the decrease in the weight of the crown would be in proportion; he could then compare those with the values of an equal weight of pure gold). He was the first to identify the concept of [[center of gravity]], and he found the centers of gravity of various geometric figures, assuming uniform [[density]] in their interiors, including triangles, [[paraboloid]]s, and [[sphere|hemisphere]]s. Using only [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[geometry]], he also gave the equilibrium positions of floating sections of paraboloids as a function of their height, a feat that would be taxing to a modern physicist using [[calculus]]. 

Apart from general physics he was an [[astronomer]], and [[Cicero]] writes that the Roman [[consul]] [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]] brought two devices back to [[Rome]] from the sacked city of Syracuse. One device mapped the [[sky]] on a sphere and the other predicted the motions of the [[sun]] and the [[moon]] and the [[planet]]s (i.e., an [[orrery]]). He credits [[Thales]] and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] for constructing these devices. For some time this was assumed to be a legend of doubtful nature, but the discovery of the [[Antikythera mechanism]] has changed the view of this issue, and it is indeed probable that Archimedes possessed and constructed such devices. [[Pappus]] of [[Alexandria]] writes that Archimedes had written a practical book on the construction of such spheres entitled ''[[On Sphere-Making]]''.

Archimedes' works were not widely recognized, even in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. He and his contemporaries probably constitute the peak of Greek [[mathematical rigour]]. During the [[Middle Ages]] the mathematicians who could understand Archimedes' work were few and far between. Many of his works were lost when the [[library of Alexandria]] was burnt (twice) and survived only in [[Latin]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[translation]]s. As a result, his ''[[how Archimedes used infinitesimals|mechanical method]]'' was lost until around [[1900]], after the [[arithmetization of analysis]] had been carried out successfully. We can only speculate about the effect that the &quot;method&quot; would have had on the development of [[calculus]] had it been known in the [[16th century|16th]] and [[17th century|17th]] centuries.

== Writings by Archimedes ==
* ''On the Equilibrium of Planes'' (2 volumes)
:This scroll explains the law of the lever and uses it to calculate the areas and centers of gravity of various geometric figures. 
* ''On Spirals''
:In this scroll, Archimedes defines what is now called [[Archimedean spiral|Archimedes' spiral]]. This is the first mechanical curve (i.e., traced by a moving point) ever considered by a Greek mathematician. Using this curve, he was able to [[Squaring the circle|square the circle]]. 
* ''On the Sphere and The Cylinder''
:In this scroll Archimedes obtains the result he was most proud of: that the area and volume of a sphere are in the same relationship to the area and volume of the circumscribed straight cylinder. 
* ''On Conoids and Spheroids''
:In this scroll Archimedes calculates the areas and volumes of sections of cones, spheres and paraboloids. 
* ''On Floating Bodies'' (2 volumes)
:In the first part of this scroll, Archimedes spells out the law of equilibrium of fluids, and proves that water around a center of gravity will adopt a spherical form. This is probably an attempt at explaining the observation made by Greek astronomers that the Earth is round. Note that his fluids are not self-gravitating: he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall and derives the spherical shape. One is led to wonder what he would have done had he struck upon the idea of universal [[gravitation]].
:In the second part, a veritable ''tour-de-force'', he calculates the equilibrium positions of sections of paraboloids. This was probably an idealization of the shapes of ships' hulls. Some of his sections float with the base under water and the summit above water, which is reminiscent of the way [[iceberg]]s float, although Archimedes probably was not thinking of this application.
* ''The Quadrature of the Parabola''
:In this scroll, Archimedes calculates the area of a segment of a parabola (the figure delimited by a parabola and a secant line not necessarily perpendicular to the axis). The final answer is obtained by [[Triangulation|triangulating]] the area and summing the geometric series with ratio 1/4. 
* ''Stomachion''
:This is a Greek puzzle similar to [[Tangram]]. In this scroll, Archimedes calculates the areas of the various pieces. This may be the first reference we have to this game. Recent discoveries indicate that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the strips of paper could be assembled into the shape of a square. This is possibly the first use of [[combinatorics]] to solve a problem.
* ''Archimedes' Cattle Problem''
:Archimedes wrote a letter to the scholars in the Library of Alexandria, who apparently had downplayed the importance of Archimedes' works. In these letters, he dares them to count the numbers of cattle in the [[Herd of the Sun]] by solving a number of simultaneous [[Diophantus|Diophantine]] equations, some of them [[quadratic equation|quadratic]] (in the more complicated version). This problem is one of the famous problems solved with the aid of a computer.  The solution is a very large number, approximately {{sn|7.760271|206544}} (See the external links to the Cattle Problem.)
* ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''
:In this scroll, Archimedes counts the number of grains of sand fitting inside the [[universe]]. This book mentions [[Aristarchus of Samos]]' theory of the [[solar system]] (concluding that &quot;this is impossible&quot;), contemporary ideas about the size of the Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. From the introductory letter we also learn that Archimedes' father was an astronomer.
* ''&quot;[[Archimedes Palimpsest|The Method]]&quot;''
:In this work, which was unknown in the Middle Ages, but the importance of which was realised after its discovery, Archimedes pioneered the use of [[infinitesimal]]s, showing how breaking up a figure in an infinite number of infinitely small parts could be used to determine its area or volume. Archimedes did probably consider these methods not mathematically precise, and he used these methods to find at least some of the areas or volumes he sought, and then used the more traditional [[method of exhaustion]] to prove them. This particular work is found in what is called the [[Archimedes bathtub flotation device]]. Some details can be found at [[how Archimedes used infinitesimals]].

==Quotes about Archimedes==
* &quot;Perhaps the best indication of what Archimedes truly loved most is his request that his tombstone include a cylinder circumscribing a sphere, accompanied by the inscription of his amazing [[theorem]] that the sphere is exactly two-thirds of the circumscribing cylinder in both surface area and volume!&quot; (Laubenbacher and Pengelley, p. 95)&lt;sup id=&quot;fn_1_back&quot;&gt;[[#fn_1|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;

* &quot;...but regarding the work of an engineer and every art that ministers the needs of life as ignoble and vulgar, he devoted his earnest efforts only to those studies the subtlety and charm of which are not affected by the claims of necessity.&quot; [[Plutarch]], possibly explaining why Archimedes produced no writings that describe precisely the design of his inventions. It has also been suggested that this statement merely reflects the prejudices of Plutarch and his peers, influenced by [[Platonic]] beliefs in pure [[reasoning]] and [[deduction]] over [[experimentation]] and [[induction (philosophy)|inductive]] processes. Given Archimedes's prodigious output as an engineer, Plutarch's often quoted comments on him seem hard to believe for modern historians.
